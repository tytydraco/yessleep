We didn't know that it was unfinished but it was definitely a mistake going there. Me and my family decided to go to a new waterpark that opened a few weeks ago. It was nearby and cheap so we decided why not? When we got there, we seen all the slides and pools. We got a hotel there for a bit, my Mother was paying for it. I was only sixteen and my sister was 8.

 We got our bathing suits on and went down to the park. Our parents told us to stick together while they were grabbing us some dinner. This place was filled with paintings and wet attractions. We went to the wavepool first. It was weirdly empty. Only about 100 guests were there. It was an unimaginably humongous park but we thought nothing of it.

 We went deep into the wave pool and suddenly something caught on my ankle. I looked down but a giant wave took me and my sister. We were underwater for a few seconds at least then we gave each other frightened looks. Another wave took us into shallower water. My skin slid on the uneven ground giving me cuts. It was shallow enough for my sister to stand up so she did. Or at least she tried, as soon as she got even a little bit standing a wave would crash her down. I even struggled getting up. I got her out of the pool and we were both out of breath and scared out of our minds.

 We rushed to our parents seats trying to find them but we just got lost in the labyrinth of slides and pools. We ended up in a kiddie pool with 4 children inside. The pool was super shallow and almost no water filled the place. My sister cried the whole time. I tried comforting her but she was so upset. I ran to a medical station to get bandaids for her and my cuts. I opened one of the first aid kits and nothing. I checked them all but they were empty. I looked over at her face. It had a giant scratch mark. I tried blocking the blood but it spilt out of my hands. I kept my hand there looking for our table to no avail. 

There was an emergency exit that we tried to go to. Maybe if we got to our room we could get our first aid stuff, I thought. We ran through the hallways, at this point we were both bawling. I ran to an elevator and pressed the floor we were on and the door closed but we weren't moving. We banged on the door for a while. We pressed all the buttons for nothing. We were trapped. We stayed for a few hours. We cried and screamed until we heard banging from the other side, "SOMEONE OPEN THE DOOR!!" a person screamed, the voice sounded familiar, it was our mom

"Mom?" I yelled back

 "Cole!? Where's your sister?"
 Aviana scream-cried, "Mom! We've been stuck in here for hours!"

 We waited for a response and heard her say, "oh shit" quietly to herself then we heard a thud. Water flowed between the cracks of the elevator door. It slowly filled the elevator, the lights flickered and shut off. The only noise was the water sloshing back and fourth until our screams pierced each other's ears. The elevator was falling. I tried laying flat on the ground but almost drowned. I got down just above the water level then we stopped. A giant force pushed all air out of my body. One of the elevator doors were dented open and we could climb through them.

 We were back at the water park. The park was flooded with water and we rushed to get high up. We climbed the highest stairway to the highest waterslide. It was one of those tube waterslides that drop you into it. When we finally got to the top. The water was more than halfway up. My sister screamed and cried. Her face was distorted with tears and sadness. I tried to think of somewhere to go when it hit me. We could hide in the tiny compartments that drop you.

 I got her into one first then closed the door. I got into a different one and shut mine too. We just hid in there and sobbed. I never thought about how we were going to get out but this was the safest way to survive right? The slides led outside to another park with massive pools. The water got up to us and the controlls for the slide. I was sobbing thinking of how we'd get out then... 

The floor crashed open. The slide was ricketly and I heard many creaks. I slowed down at a massive hill. Luckily the water was still on so it would push me up but then the water slide creaked and crashed. I was stuck right there until the slide crashed one last time and split into two. I fell into a slide from a large height and it felt like a belly-flop on steroids. My back ached while I reached up for the air. I grabbed onto a metal bar and pulled myself up. The water was shallow so I also hit the ground while falling causing back damage that I'd feel my whole life. Deep breaths I told myself, I was outside of the flooded park, nothing could hurt me now. Then I thought of my sister. I needed to find her. The poor soul, what if her slide broke inside the flooded park. Or worse, over concrete. I needed to find her, now! I rushed around the park and found nothing. I ran and ran until I seen her. 

The giant scar on her face was patched up by a giant bandage. There was a girl next to her. She looked around moms age. Then I heard the sirens. They were paramedics. My sister ran to me and we hugged for a while. She cried in my arms as another ambulance pulled into the park. I looked past her and saw my dad. His foot was heavily covered with red bandages. I couldn't see mom anywhere. The more I looked the more I realized she was gone.. 

that was five years ago and now, just now, they found out that it was unfinished..
