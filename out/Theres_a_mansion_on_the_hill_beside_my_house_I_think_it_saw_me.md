I live in a place called **Halgrave**. You won’t find it on most maps — and if you do, your GPS will freeze the second you cross the old stone bridge. It’s a town of about 500 people, tucked in a valley no one drives through unless they’re lost. There’s one diner, one gas pump, and a library run by a woman who hasn’t said a word since her nephew disappeared ten years ago.

Growing up here means you get used to silence. And secrets. Especially about **the hill**.

Behind the town, there’s a stretch of forest we call *The Thickets*. Thick-trunked, black-barked trees packed so tight they blot out the sun even at noon. The local kids used to dare each other to touch the moss-covered milestone at the edge of the trail. No one ever stepped past it. No one smart, anyway.

Past the forest, if you push deep enough (and people say not to), there’s a hill. And on top of that hill stands **Blackthorn Manor**.

We don’t talk about the manor. Not really. We talk around it. Someone might say they "saw a light on the ridge last night" or that "the wind sounded strange" — but no one ever says the name. It’s just… understood.

The last time anyone admitted going near it was in 2013. Her name was **Ellie Mayhew**. She was sixteen. One night, she told her friend she was going to find out the truth about the house. She walked into the forest alone. They never found her. Her house has been boarded up since.

I didn’t plan to go looking for anything. But one night last summer, I saw something.

I’d just finished a shift at the diner and was walking home down Main Row — the stretch of town with the old community center, the boarded-up theater, and Connor’s garage (he’s the only one in town who can fix a carburetor without a manual). I cut past the trail like I always do. And then I saw it.

A faint light. Pale, golden. Coming from the top floor of the mansion.

I froze. The forest around me went dead quiet. Not just “night quiet.” *Wrong* quiet.

Then I heard a voice behind me:  
“Ruth. You see that?”

It was Connor. Pale, sweaty. Staring at the same light.  
“That’s not the moon,” he said. “Moon’s behind us.”

I nodded, barely breathing. The light blinked off. The forest exhaled.

The next morning, the librarian nailed a note to the post office door.  
**"Children must stay inside after dark. The house remembers."**  
That was all it said.

I thought maybe it was a prank. Until I got the envelope.

No stamp. No return address. Just black wax sealed with a symbol I didn’t recognize. Inside, one sentence written in careful, perfect handwriting:

>"It saw you too."

That night, I dreamed of footsteps behind my bedroom wall. Slow, patient ones. They haven’t stopped since.

I haven’t told anyone. Not Connor, not my dad, not even Mrs. Calloway. But something in the town has changed. Dogs are barking at nothing. The post office clock is stuck at 3:33. And people are acting like they’re trying very hard *not* to remember something.

I think the house is waking up again. And I think it wants someone.

*Part Two: The house sent something into town.*

I didn’t open the envelope again. I burned it. Watched the black wax curl and blister in a coffee can behind the shed.

It didn’t help.

The **next morning**, my dad didn’t come downstairs. He usually made coffee before I woke up. I went to his room. His bed was untouched — the covers too tight, too flat. Like a stage prop. His shoes were by the door, but the door was still locked from the inside. He just… wasn’t there.

I called the sheriff’s station. It rang twice. Then silence.

Not a busy signal. Not voicemail. Just… silence.  
Like the phone had been picked up, but no one on the other end was breathing.

I walked into town. It was foggy — *but the sun was up*. Fog doesn’t hang like that in full daylight, not unless something’s wrong. By the time I passed the old theater, I noticed it: the silence was *too wide*. No birds. No wind. No sound of tires or chatter. Just my own footsteps on the sidewalk.

Then I saw her.

A little girl, maybe six or seven, in a **white dress**, barefoot, standing in front of the **Calloway Library**. Her hair was wet. Dripping.

“Are you Ruth?” she asked.

I nodded, stupidly.

She smiled — but only with her mouth. Her eyes stayed dead.  
“Then it’s your turn to go up the hill.”

I blinked and she was gone.

I don’t mean she ran. I mean she *wasn’t there anymore*. Like someone had edited her out of the frame.

I ran to Connor’s garage. He was there, half under a car, headphones in. When I banged on the hood, he flinched hard enough to hit his head.

“You saw her too?” I asked.

He just stared. “You got the envelope, didn’t you?”

He had one too. His was still sealed. He hadn’t dared open it.  
We agreed not to talk about it in the open. Something was *listening*.

That night, I locked my bedroom door and pushed the dresser in front of it. The town felt wrong — like we were insects sealed in a jar and something had just started tapping the glass.

At 3:33 AM — not 3:32, not 3:34 — my doorknob turned.

Not fast. **Slow**. Deliberate.  
Like it was making sure I heard it.

Then the whisper came through the wood. A dry, breathless voice that didn’t sound angry. It sounded... patient.

>"You don't have to walk to the house. We can bring it to you."

The next morning, the road out of town was gone.

Not blocked — **gone**. Just trees. Unbroken forest. As if no one had ever built a road at all.

Connor tried to drive out. He came back an hour later. Car totaled. Face blank. He wouldn’t speak. Just sat there muttering numbers that didn’t make sense.

And that night, I dreamed of my dad. Standing at the window of the manor. Smiling.  
Behind him, something moved.

It wore **his skin**, but it wasn’t him.
