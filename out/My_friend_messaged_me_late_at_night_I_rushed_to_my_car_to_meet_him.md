He hadn't been to his job in days. His wife had called me one night in tears to tell me that she had found a note telling her that he was gone and not to come looking for him. So when I got that text from him, I quickly jumped out of bed, got dressed, and gargled down some mouthwash. He had texted me from an unknown number. All that was in his message was him identifying himself to me, an address, and a plea not tell his wife. I agreed to that last term for the time being. I didn't want to agitate him further. I would just tell his wife afterwards when I had convinced him to come home. But now I know that she must never learn of our meeting. It would be too dangerous for both of us.

I drove through the night well above the speed limit. Cops be damned. I wanted to get to him before he could change his mind. I thought that if he could just see me, he would realize that he had to come home.

The address turned out to be some old church in dire need of repair. My friend stood by the entrance smoking. We had both quit while in college. His father dying of lung cancer was the catalyst that got him to stop all those years ago. I doubted he would just pick back up the habit so easily. Before I got out of my car, I turned on the voice recording on my phone. I didn't know whether or not my friend was having some psychotic break. I didn't know if he done something horrific that he was going to confess to me. I just wanted to make sure I had a record of whatever the hell he was about to say. It is from this recording that I am able to copy down word for word what we said. The rest, I was able to fill out from what I remember from that night. Trust me, I won't be forgetting that night anytime soon. I want the world to know the truth. I don't want anyone to think I made this all up. But once I'm done writing this all down, once I upload this thing, I'm done. That recording will be deleted. I've already listened to it a couple times. It takes all the strength I have not to smash my fucking phone just to get rid of it.

As I got out of my car, I stuffed my phone into my purse, making sure to keep it open. When he saw me, he dropped his cigarette, mashed into the ground with his shoe, and came up to me, embracing me tightly in his arms. I was surprised he hadn't heard my car pull up into the church parking lot. my car was certainly not a quiet thing. He seemed distracted as I talked to him. But he also looked grateful to see me. At that moment, I genuinely believed I was going to convince him to come home.

"D----, please come home. We miss you," I said into his ear as we hugged.

He chuckled and broke the embrace. A sad smile hung from his face. "Oh E-----, I wish I could. I wish I could just walk back into my house, kiss A---, and pretend everything was okay and normal."

"Why can't you?"

"Come inside. Let's grab some seat. I'll tell you everything and if you still want me to come home after that, I will." This was a lie and his smile told me that. "You're the only one that could convince me. You know that E-----."

"Teaching had always been my dream," he said sitting down. "Sure, things haven't always been great, but it's what I love. And for the most part, things in the school system have remained pretty similar. I guess that isn't hurt by how small the school is."

What does this have to do with why you disappeared?"

"I'm getting to it, E-----. Please, just let me get it all out. I promise I'll tell you everything."

"Sure, D----. I'll let you get through with it."

"Thank you. I noticed it about a month ago. I had just gotten back to work after a week of illness. I don't know how long it had been going on before I got back. But the kids in my classes started acting differently. The ones who consistently got good grades started regressing. That's not even mentioning the ones who struggled. Every now and then, the principal would come and take a couple students out of my classroom. When they returned, they were silent. As more and more of my students went with the principal, the quieter my room became. There was no longer constant conversation in the morning. I tried engaging in conversation with my students, but I got only one or two worded responses. I eventually stopped even trying. And yes, I did talk to the other teachers. I'm not stupid, E-----, despite everything you might say. They all dismissed it. They were being as weird as the kids and just said that the children were being taken away for simple testing. There was nothing to it, they reassured me.

"The student's behavior wasn't the only change I noticed. The food also was different. Simply, it tasted like shit. It smelled even worse. I couldn't even think about wanting to eat it without feeling the urge to vomit. Still, the kids and the rest of the teachers stuffed their faces with it. Packed lunches had been banned at our school. Some stupid rule made by some stupid person who didn't know jack about how to run a school. The teachers had to follow the same rules as the students. Provided a good example, they said. I still brought a packed lunch, though. A--- made them special for me every morning. I didn't care about following the rules. I couldn't keep that grub down. It really was that bad. I hated it. I despised it. Everyday, I filled my tray with that garbage, sat down, pretended to eat—all the while trying to keep my mind off the fucking smell—and after a little while, I would dump it all in the trash. No one cared enough to notice. It was during my free period that I would eat the lunch A--- had packed for me.

"It was one day that after I had dipped away to eat my secret lunch that I saw one the principal head to the back of the building. I was curious, and I followed him. E-----, what I saw scared the hell out of me. I had been teaching at that school—in that building—for years. I promise you, I know every square inch of that damn building. But I didn't know that door that the he walked through. I know that door wasn't supposed to be there, yet this man I had known for two-or-so years walked through it. God help me, I followed him. I opened the doorway and saw a hallway that shouldn't exist. I slammed the door shut before me, not wanting to see something I couldn't comprehend. That hallway haunted me in my dreams. I couldn't get the fucking thing out of my head. So a couple days later, I returned to that hallway at night.

"I felt like a goddamn spy breaking into the school. The janitors are usually the last to leave the school premises. One of them was a buddy of mine. So as he was locking up, I ran up to him. Lying through my teeth, I told him I had left something in my classroom. I begged him to let me in to grab it. I promised that I would lock up afterwards. Sighing, he acquiesced. He was use to my bullshit. This, unfortunately, wasn't the first time I had mistakenly left something in the building.

"Once inside, I made my way to the back of the building. Seeing the door still there, I stopped in my tracks. I had half-believed I had made it all up. Of course, I hadn't. Of course, I was sane. I went to the door to open it. I prayed that the door would be locked. That I could just say 'Oh, well' and then just forget all about that shit and go home to A---. But as I twisted the doorknob, the door opened at once, revealing the hallway that shouldn't exist. That day I had first seen the hallway, I had gone to the back of the building just to make sure that I wasn't making up shit in my head. But no, there was no room for the hallway. That door should have just opened up to alleyway. But now I was looking at the same impossible hallway for the second time. The moment I opened that doorway, I realized I couldn't go back. Something in my head—either in my own voice, or hell, maybe even someone else's—was telling me that I needed to go forward. That entering this hallway was my destiny. So I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. I immediately regretted that choice the moment I made it.

"Observing the hallway, what first struck me was how short it was. There were only two doorways on either side and then another one at the end of the hallway. Otherwise, it looked like any other hallway in the school. It spooked me how normal it looked. I had had a glimpse of it before, but I hadn't taken it all in. What I had taken in, I had twisted into some Twilight Zone shit, but no it was all so fucking normal. After the initial moment I took to observe the hallway, I began exploring. Naturally, I started with the first door.

"Pushing the door open, I was scared of what might lie within the room. Once I did fully opened the door, I literally closed my eyes, hoping that once I opened them, I would be at my home, in my bed, and next to A---. What I did see when I opened my eyes was machinery. So much machinery. It crowed the room, E-----. I couldn't take more than two steps inside the room, let alone shut the door behind me. In its current state, the machine was shut off. But I could smell what it had been up to. The stench that had plagued me in the cafeteria was twenty time worse in this room. I guessed whatever the hell they had been feeding the kids came from this machine. I would have examined it further, but I couldn't stand the stench. It it enveloped me, and I feared I was going to vomit. So I shut that door behind me and went to the next.

"The second door opened up on an empty classroom. Thank Christ, it was empty. I had expected to find something like this in the hallway, but part of me had also expected to find some of my students in there, basically turned into brainless zombies."

At this point my friend laughed. "What a horrible turn of phrase," he said disgusted with himself. "Sorry about that E-----." He didn't pause for me to accept his apology that then made no sense to me, but instead just carried on.

"I explored the classroom, but there really wasn't much in there worthy of notation. What was of note was what wasn't in there. There were no educational materials, no lesson plan at the teacher's desk, and I swear to God I searched every single desk but found no doodles, no carvings, or anything on the desks. I would be lucky to find even one desk without any such markings in my own room, but here, they were all pristine. The classroom almost seemed like a waiting room. Unlike the room with the machinery, this room didn't physically make me ill. But it was somehow worse. This room scared me like I had never been scared before. It was familiar, yet somehow still unfamiliar. This room should have been my lifeline—the one room resembling normalcy. But I just wanted to get out of there. Any place was better than that fucking room.

"Behind the third door was an office. It was an exact mirror of the principal's office which was on the other side of the building. Down to the damned paperclips, the room was the same. Hell, there was even the same mangled fire extinguisher that the principal kept for some unknown reason. There was some story behind it. I just never cared enough to listen to him explain it. The only thing out of place was an entire wall of file cabinets. I would have gone through them then, but they were all locked. It didn't seem to matter at that point. It wasn't worth the time it would take to pry them open. There were still two more doors that I needed to open. I didn't want to be in this building any longer than I had to.

"What I saw behind door number four made me lose my sanity for a little while. Though, I'm really not sure that I ever regained it. There was a laboratory, and in that laboratory, I saw the children that had been pulled out of my classroom. They were all stuck in these medical tanks. I think I could have kept my composure if that had been all; it of course wasn't. These students were lined up next to each other. But lined up after them was row after row after row of copies. They were fucking cloning them,  E-----. Oh Jesus Christ, they were cloning them. There were so, so many of them. So many of the same person. I should have left then. I should have left that damned hallway right then. No, no, no, that's not correct. I should have dowsed that fucking place in gasoline and set it on fire. But even that probably wouldn't have been enough. Only burning that whole fucking school down might have actually destroyed all that I saw. But,  E-----, I needed to know what was behind the fifth door.

"It was locked.

"But that wasn't going to stop me. Not then. Not after what I had seen. I rushed into the office, grabbed the prized fire extinguisher, and bashed that fucking doorknob off. As the door to room five swung open, I felt the fire extinguisher slip through my fingers. When the extinguisher hit the floor, it made a clang that I didn't process.

"Room number five was an autopsy room. On those tables, I saw the bodies of the children I taught. They had been dissected. I walked into the room and around the tables. The kids had had their skull caps removed as well. They just laid on the tables next to the bodies. Their brains were missing. I had to grab onto the table just to steady myself. I stuck my hand in some goop. Disgusted, I threw myself off it and tripping over myself, I landed on the floor. There was a container on the ground. The container was labeled "**FOR USE**." I could see the fluid through the container and the brains floating within that fluid.

"I jumped from the floor, trying my hardest not to connect all the rooms to each other in my mind, and ran to the office. I grabbed the extinguisher along the way. I went to the file cabinets and time after time, I rammed that extinguisher into them. I needed them unlocked. I needed to disprove these fucking theories that were being crammed into my head all of the sudden. The second that I was able to, I tore the paper from the metal jaws of the cabinets, ripping some of the papers to shreds as I did so. That wouldn't matter, I thought to myself. There would surely be enough information in these pages that would disprove what I already knew to be true.

"Sitting on the floor, I went through the pages. With every line I read, with every graph that I examined, the dread within me built. It was a chart that confirmed every fear that had been rolling around in my head. The chart was simply labeled "**Outtake/Intake**." Both columns contained entry after entry of meat weighed in pounds. For example, that day when I decided to break in—the eighth—there was an outtake of 215.7 pounds and an intake of 180.2 pounds. Apparently, the students didn't eat up to par that day. That's why their brains were missing, E-----. They were fucking eating them. Those goddamn bastards were feeding the kids their own brains. Fuck, even I took a bite or two of that cafeteria food. It was another document that hadn't been ripped to ribbons that told me why the kids were being fed that. They were putting something in the brain mush that they were serving. It was some chemical, some substance, that doesn't exist. Zillenium—that's what they was called it. I wrote that name down on a post-it note to look up later. I looked it up, but it doesn't exist. No scientific journal nor any other verified source mentions it. I couldn't even find the name in any fucking conspiracy theorist rabbit hole.

"I guess it doesn't really matter that this material hasn't been recorded by anyone; what matters is what the chemical is supposed to do to the brains. This chemical supposedly made the brains a super food, meant to make whoever ate it smarter. It did this by opening up a portion of the brain human's don't use. Unfortunately for whoever's in charge of this damned experiment, the chemical also had the side effect of basically turning the student into meat-puppets. That's why the children turned all dumb. Unfortunately for me, the chemical also had a useful side effect. It didn't affect adults in the same way as it did children. Instead, the seasoned meat made them complacent. After eating the cafeteria food for an extended period of time, the teachers just no longer cared. But that's why they were cutting them up. They of course needed the brains for the food, but they were cutting into their bodies to figure out why the children were behaving the way they were. They need the children smart for whatever they're planning on doing. What that is, I don't know. I had planned on figuring out, but they somehow figured out what I had done.

"I don't know how they figured out—never mind, that's bullshit. I left that place a mess. There wasn't much I could have done to fix the caved-in file cabinets; so I just left. They must have had some cameras or something that saw me. But anyway, I woke up in the morning and went into the kitchen to have yogurt or something-or-other. But A--- told me that the principal had called. He needed to see me after school about something. I knew in an instant that my life was over. They knew. And no matter what I did, they would come after me. Needless to say, I skipped out on the yogurt. I packed all the shit I would usually take to school, kissed A--- goodbye, and left. I left a note in the garage telling A--- not to look for me, and after a few miles of driving, I tossed my phone out the window. I then went to a bank to withdraw some cash. I've been living out of shitty motels since.

"I'm sorry I'm telling you all this, E-----. If they knew you met with me, they'd probably kill you as well. I- I just couldn't live with the thought of everyone thinking I killed myself. I'm sure that's what they'll do when they find me—make it look like I had enough with life and ended it all. You can't tell A--- what happened, but I just needed one person to know the truth. Be with her after it happens. It'll crush, A---. Thank's for listening, E-----."

I didn't know how to process what I had just heard. I thought I had been right. I thought he'd had some break with reality. And so I begged one last time.

"D----, please come home," I said in a whimper. "You said you would if I asked." He just smiled.

"It's okay that you don'y believe me,  E-----. Just promise me one thing. Don't for second believe that I killed myself. You know I wouldn't do that to A---. Do you promise?"

I nodded.

"Okay, that's good. That's really good. Goodbye." He bent down to kiss me on the cheek. "I really hope I see you again,  E-----." he then walked away.

I had made up my mind to run after him to *get* him to come home by any means necessary. But my legs were jelly. I physically couldn't stand up until fifteen minutes after I heard his vehicle pull out of the church parking lot.

The last thing the voice recorder picked up were my sobs before I turned it off.

It was only a couple days later that we got news of his death. I hadn't by then decided what I was going to do. He hadn't died by suicide like he had expected. Instead, they called his death an accident. That alone wouldn't have convinced me of what he said, but what did convince me was that the police and everyone said that the accident had occurred on the initial day he had gone missing and had been dead ever since. I comforted his wife as best I could, but I couldn't sleep. I couldn't get what he said out of my head. I was scared. I was so scared. I immediately deleted the texts he had sent me on his burner. I was also about to delete the recording of our conversation, but I realized I couldn't. These, for all I knew, were his final words. Even if they weren't, they were the words of his that truly mattered. Whether he had meant to or not, he had implicated me in his mess. So I decided to put his warning out there. Maybe once it's out there, I can finally get a good night's sleep.

I transcribed our conversation and put it on a USB drive. I'm planning on driving several states away to plug the thing into some library computer to upload it to the web. Hopefully, everyone who's out there might be able to do something more with it than I could.

I'm sure there's enough information in here that could identify me. Honestly, I don't care. They killed my friend. They widowed his wife. I want them to pay. Plus, I'm also sure whoever did it is keeping a careful eye on the both of us, wondering if either of us had been let onto the secret he had uncovered. Well, here's your proof, you pricks. At least this confession, or whatever the hell it is, will clear her. She at least deserves to have a normal life unburdened from this shit.
