My name is Jonathan Buckingham, and I am the most average person in the world. There are few, if any, individuals less particular than me. I live in an American suburb, of which city I needn't mention, with my slightly less average wife and even more slightly less average children (2, although if I could have 2.5, I would). I also have a Golden Retriever, which I share with my family so that it is our dog. I am a red-blooded political moderate (socially liberal, fiscally conservative), a straight, white man of middle age. I work a desk job at a local business, a job that I earned after a staunchly mediocre 4 years at a state college (almost straight Cs!). I eat meat but do not like thinking about where it comes from, as it gives me a confusing and shameful feeling inside. I am not lean, but not obese either. My beloved wife enjoys my company at exactly the size I am at.

I do know people who are not as average as me. Over the past few days, my neighbor Mike has been knocking on our door in the mid-afternoon, clearly wishing to speak to my beautiful and precious family about something or other. I tell my gorgeous wife and 2 beautiful, intelligent children to ignore him, as he is obviously troubled and not as societally cognizant as us. He usually just gets bored and walks away. My 2 gifted and wonderfully blessed children often ask me

"Daddy, what does Mike want from us?" I shush them and reply:

"My 2 brilliantly glistening diamonds—what does it matter? Should we receive madmen with the same affection as our kin?"

They abandon their line of questioning after that.

One day, I caught Mike perusing our trimmed and well (but not too well)-kept lawn, muttering to himself about something or other. He approached me, misty-eyed and dejected.

"Mr. Buckingham! I've been meaning to ask you something. My dog Buddy went missing a couple of days ago. He's a black lab with a red collar with his name and all that. He has a doghouse in our backyard that he sleeps in, and one day I woke up and he was gone! So, just a heads up: if you see a black lab around the neighborhood, let me know."

I nodded and smiled. How much longer would I have to appease his madness? After a half-hearted farewell, I returned to my abode. Feeling a pang of hunger, I swing open the fridge doors. Scanning my selection of nourishment, I decided that all that talking had worked up an appetite my non-special fridge could not quash. Traveling downstairs, I locate my special (although still completely and utterly ordinary) mini-fridge.

The nourishment here is plentiful. Tender black loins, plump and meaty paws that drip with bestial juices. A lone hazel eye stares out at me from the icy depths. It is sad and betrayed.

"My," I say, "you really put the guilt in guilty pleasure."

 

I dig in, spitting out the red strip of leather that I had forgotten to remove. I was doing as I was born to do as an average animal, consuming the weak with bliss. It is as God intended. Before long, the basement floor is sloppy with meat. A sigh of satisfaction escaped my mouth. It was time to clean up.

 

My one-in-a-million, glimmering gold trophy of a wife sits across from me at the dinner table.

 

"What's in this meatloaf, honey?" she asks.

 

"Just some pork, a little veal. You know, the usual." We all lie to our wives sometimes.

 

I peeked out the window of our modest and mundane dwelling to spot Mike interrogating my 2 amazing kids. Intimating, gesticulating, sorrowing. What right does he have to talk to my offspring in such a fashion?

 

There really are some sick people in this world.
