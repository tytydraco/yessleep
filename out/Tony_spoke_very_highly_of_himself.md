I want to tell you about what happened with my sister and her boyfriend.  It was a long time ago now, but I still feel like someone ought to know.

My sister’s name is Diffie.  I mean, her real name is Eugenia, but no one calls her that.  You know how it goes.  When this all happened, she working part-time at the Food Ministry downtown and living upstairs in our parents’ big old farmhouse.

I was still living there too, for the time being, but I had just graduated from college and I was flying out to a lot of interviews in Chicago and New York and places like that.  Don’t get me wrong, I loved my parents and all, but I couldn’t wait to land a high-powered job in a high-powered city and start my life for real.

It was the Friday before Father’s Day, and I’d just made it back from Philadelphia.  The actual interview had gone great, but the return trip was something Dante would have edited out for being too disturbing.  When I finally stumbled back into my ancestral home, I was five hours late and it was dinnertime.

My mom was in the kitchen, sweating over pasta.  "I’m so glad you made it home, dear.  Your father and I were so worried.  We didn’t want you to miss – well, I guess we’ll see, won’t we?"  She twinkled her eyes at me, like she did.

I was still full of airport food and not at my sharpest.  "Uh, see what?"

"Well, Tony, silly."  She shot me a glance over the marinara.  "He’s still coming tonight, you know.  And I really do think he might be getting ready to pop the question!"  She twinkled even harder.  "Diffie’s upstairs getting ready.  I think she thinks so, too.  Isn’t it wonderful, Jack?"

"Um, yeah," I said.  "Absolutely.  Congratulations.  To Diffie, I mean."

I shut up and tried to help with the pasta, but I didn’t do it very well, because a funny thing was happening.  I knew what my mom was talking about: it was Friday, which meant that Diffie’s boyfriend Tony was coming to dinner.  And if the way he’d been pressing his suit the past few weeks was any indication, a proposal was definitely on the table.

The funny part, though, was this: until a few seconds ago, I hadn’t remembered any of that.  And that didn’t seem right.  I mean, I was pretty distracted and I hadn’t been around much lately, but still.

It bothered me, so I kept thinking about it while I set the table and hauled some cold beers out of the bonus fridge with my dad.  And I found that I could remember all kinds of things about Tony, things that made me happy to think I might get to call him my brother-in-law one day soon: the time he’d rescued a kitten from a tree, the time he’d told a joke that made an entire bus full of people burst out laughing, stuff like that.

But I wasn’t sure *how* or *why* I remembered that stuff.  Like, had I been on the bus when he told that joke?  I wasn’t sure that I had.

I went up to Diffie’s room and knocked.  She opened the door with her hair half-done and gave me a big hug.  "Hey there, Wolf of Wall Street!  So glad you made it!"

I hugged her back.  "I know you’re busy," I said, "but this is bugging me.  About – "

"Oh, is Dad on you about the house trust again?"  She took both my hands.  "Listen, Jack.  You do what’s right for you.  Dad means well, but it’s your call to make.  You know I’ll back you either way."

She let me go and started doing things with her hair.  "I’m so, *so* sorry,  but I’ve got to rush.  I know how Tony gets about his suits, and don’t want to go down there like the honest but frumpy shopgirl he pulled up from the gutter.  We’ll talk soon, okay?"  She kissed my cheek and slammed the door.

I stared at the door for a minute and wondered if I knew how Tony got about his suits.  Eventually I wandered back downstairs.

By the time the doorbell rang and my parents went to welcome Tony with cries of gladness, I was pretty sure I was having some sort of episode.  The stress of developing into such a crackerjack businessman, probably.  I shook it off and went in for the handshake.

Tony looked the same as he always did: barrel chest, tanned bald head, wraparound shades that he never took off.  Something did seem a bit off with him tonight, though, and I wasn’t sure what.  Like his skin was stretched too tightly over his face, or something.  I wasn’t even sure if that made any sense.

"Jack!"  He grinned at me with his perfect teeth.  "Remember the time I helped you with that research paper?"

I did, sort of, but it seemed odd to bring it up.  "Uh, yeah.  That was great.  Thanks, Tony."

"Ha-HA!"  He clapped me on the back.  "And where is the lovely Eugenia?"

That was another thing.  No one called her that, remember?  But Tony always did.  I tried to remember him calling her Diffie, and I couldn’t.

Diffie made her appearance and launched herself into Tony’s arms, and we all went through for dinner.  Dad said grace, and Tony sat and grinned with his head held perfectly straight.  When Mom got up to serve the pasta, he reached into his duffel bag and pulled out a classic ‘80s boombox.

"Uh-oh!" Mom twinkled.  "Here comes the wooing!"  Diffie giggled and sipped her red wine.

Tony punched some buttons, and a jazzy backbeat filled the air.  He gave us all a stiff bow and stood at attention like a soldier.  "This song," he announced, "is to be *trusted*."

Then he started to sing.  His song went on for a long time, and I’ve forgotten most of it.  Here are some parts I do remember:

>*Well, I went downtown and what did I see?*

>*An itty bitty kitty sittin’ up in a tree*

>*So I climbed that tree and I rescued that cat*

>*I’m a handsome, humorous man!*

>*The engine on the bus had begun to smoke*

>*So I stood up and I asked ‘em, have you heard this joke?*

>*All the folks on the bus, well they laughed and clapped*

>*I’m a handsome, humorous man!*

It was hard to tell with the sunglasses, but he didn’t really seem to be looking at any of us while he sang it.  Also, his grin never changed, which kind of put me off.

No one else seemed to mind, though.  Dad was even snapping his fingers in time with the beat as Tony sang.  As for Diffie, you’d have thought she was a Disney princess glimpsing true love for the first time.

>*I was all alone in the city at night*

>*And a bad, bad fella started pickin’ a fight*

>*But he went down hard when I hit him just right*

>*I’m a handsome, humorous man!*

Eventually the song ended.  Everyone clapped, just like the people on the bus.  Tony bowed again.  "Lovely Eugenia," he said.

I clapped even harder.  "That was *great*, Tony.  Hey, can you remind me? What was that joke you told on the bus?"

Tony turned the grin on me.  There was definitely something wrong with his skin now.  "Jack!  Remember that time I showed you how to find the very best fishing hole?"

I did, sort of.  "Nope," I said.  "Sorry.  What was the joke, again, though?"

Tony clicked his teeth together twice.  My parents were trading uncomfortable glances.  Diffie just looked kind of out of it.  I drank more beer.  "It was highly situational," Tony grumbled.

"I get it," I said.  "Say no more.  Do you live in the city, by the way, Tony?  I don’t think I’ve been to your place."

"You should visit," said Tony.  He took a card out of his pocket and handed it to me.  "I would welcome you.  Show you what I have for your sister.  We would drink beer."  He grinned wider.  "Just like after you graduated.  Remember that, Jack?"

I did, sort of.  "Nope.  It was sure great to see you though, Tony."

"Yes."  He turned to Diffie.  "Lovely Eugenia.  Next week I may have something to ask you.  After Jack visits."  He gathered up his boombox and said his goodbyes.  I didn’t shake his hand on the way out.

\---

"You seemed kind of mad at Tony," my dad said afterwards.  "Did you guys have a falling out or something?"  Mom and Diffie had gone for a walk, and we were drinking beer in the study.

I wasn’t sure how to put it.  "Um, not exactly."  I looked at the card Tony had given me.  It was an address in the nearest town, in one of the older neighborhoods.  "It’s just – how well do we know him, really?"

Dad looked surprised.  "Uh, I dunno.  How well do we know anyone?  He’s handsome.  He’s humorous.  Seems like a good match for Diffie."

"Does he?  What’s his best joke?"

Dad blinked.  "I mean, there was that one on the bus.  Everyone clapped for that."  He put his beer aside and leaned in.  "Listen, never mind that.  Just be cool when he comes next week, okay?  What I really wanted to ask you about was the house trust."

I groaned inside.  Dad wanted to put the farmhouse into a trust and make me a trustee.  So it could stay in the family, pass to me when he and Mom were gone.  The thing was, I loved my Dad, but I wanted to be in New York making top-tier business deals.  Living my own life, you know?

I couldn’t do that from the farmhouse.  But I didn’t want to hurt Dad’s feelings.  I forget how I put him off, but soon enough Mom and Diffie got home, and the talk turned to backgammon and bedtime.

\---

It was just after noon the next day when I pulled my Jeep Cherokee to a stop outside an abandoned laundromat and walked three blocks to the address on Tony’s card.  The neighborhood was denser and shabbier than I remembered.  A pack of four dogs raced down the street and disappeared through a hole in a fence.  A guy in a shapeless hat loitered outside a convenience store.  I didn’t see any kids playing outside – odd for a Saturday.

The house was all cracked yellow stucco and wild weeds in bone-dry planters.  A faded brown fence hid most of the yard from view.  I double-checked the card, but there was no mistake.  I walked up and knocked.

I waited a long time.  After awhile I started to feel like someone was looking at me through the peephole.  I raised my hand to knock again, but the door opened first.  "Jack!" said a girl in red.

I mean, she was *all* in red: red dress, red shoes, red stockings.  She even had red gloves on.  "I’m Tippy," she said.  "Please do come in."  She smiled at me with red lips.

"Nice to meet you," I said.  A blast of hot air had hit me when she opened the door.  It smelled like dust and spiders.  "Are you Tony’s sister?"

She smiled harder.  "Tony’s told me so much.  Please."  She turned and walked back into the house.

The house was yellow inside, too.  The hallway went on and on, with rooms on both sides.  They didn’t seem right.  There wasn’t much furniture, for one thing.  And all of it was covered in dust.  It was hard to imagine people living in any of them.

The hallway ended in a large room with no windows.  The top half of the walls were covered in wallpaper that looked like newsprint.  The bottom half were the same shocking red as Tippy’s clothes.  So was the carpet.  It was hard to tell where the carpet ended and the walls began.  Looking at it kind of gave me a headache.

The only furniture was a long table with some origami birds sitting on it.  They looked like they were made out of newsprint, too.

"Here we are," Tippy said.

I looked around.  It didn’t help.  "Um, is Tony here?"

Tippy held up one red finger.  "Watch this," she said.  She went and stood behind the long table.  Then she lifted up one of the origami birds and put it over her face, like a mask.  It stuck.

"Um," I said.

With the mask on, it was really hard to see Tippy’s head against the newsprint walls, and I couldn’t see her legs against the red walls or carpet either.  She was just a headless red torso, like a shadow puppet.

She started to bend at the knees, slowly and gracefully.  From my angle, it looked like the torso was melting into the ground.  When her neck reached the height where the newsprint met the red on the walls, she stopped.  Now I couldn’t see her at all.

I blinked.  "That’s, uh, impressive.  Did you make all this yourself?"

She didn’t answer, so I walked around the table to try to see her better.  There was no one there.

"Hello?"  I said.  "Tippy?  Hello?"  I walked around and waved my arms through the space where she’d been.  Nothing happened.

I got scared, and that made me mad.  I struck out with my arm and knocked some of the origami birds onto the floor.  "Hey!" I shouted.  "*Hey*!"

No one answered.  The birds looked up at me from the floor.  I imagined five Tippies, staring up at me from under the ground.  That made me even madder, so I kicked one of the birds.  It crumpled and ripped, but didn’t move.  I backed out of the room and slammed the door shut.

The hallway looked even yellower than before.  I tried some of the other rooms.  The first one had nothing in it but a huge leather barber’s chair.  The carpet was covered with blonde hair clippings.  They were covered in dust, too.

The next room was empty, but a four-foot section of the far wall was ajar, like a door.  I went in and pulled it open.  Behind it was a cramped storage space paneled in mustard-colored shag carpet.  A small photo of Tony hung on the back wall.  He was grinning like always, but his skin looked red and painful.  His cheeks stretched agonizingly around his smile.  I backed out and closed the panel.

The room was bathed in the red-gold light of sunset.  That didn’t seem right.  I couldn’t possibly have been in the house for more than fifteen minutes.  I ran for the door and out into the driveway.  Sure enough, the sun was going down.  I checked my watch.  It was past eight o’clock.

I shoved my hands in my pockets and walked fast toward the Cherokee.  For some reason, I didn’t want anyone to see me running.  Halfway there, an old lady with a walker reached out and grabbed my arm.  "You’ve got to be careful with that house," she said.

I glanced over my shoulder.  I could still see the house.  I didn’ t want to stop here.  "Why is that, ma’am?"  I asked.

"Well, it’s yellow," she said.  "But it’s also green."

It looked yellow to me.

"Thank you, ma’am," I said.  "I was just going home."

"Oh, thank goodness," she said.  "I was afraid you were going to go in the shed."  She gripped my arm tighter.  "Please don’t ever go in the shed."  She let me go and continued on down the sidewalk.

"Why is that, ma’am?" I asked again.  But she didn’t answer.  And I didn’t ask a third time.

\---

I broke several speed laws driving home that night.  My dad was still up when I arrived, looking at tractors on the internet.  I sat down with him and insisted on signing the house trust papers then and there.

The following week, I had a Thursday interview scheduled in Boston.  I cancelled it.  At dinnertime on Friday, I was sitting on the front porch in my favorite rocking chair when Tony marched up the steps.

"Jack!" he said.  His duffel bag swung lightly from one arm.  "Remember when – "

"Nope," I said.  "I’ve got some bad news, Tony."

He furrowed his brows at me.  The grin didn’t change.  "The lovely Eugenia?"

I shrugged.  "In a way.  It’s like this."  I clapped him on the shoulder.  "I’m the trustee of this property now.  And you’re no longer welcome."

Tony stood and grinned for awhile.  Then he turned on his heel and left without a word.  I went inside and locked the door behind me.

In the dining room, Diffie and Mom were laying out four place settings.  Dad was carefully spreading barbecue sauce over ribs.  I grinned at everyone – not like Tony, but I did my best.  "Just us tonight?" I asked.

Diffie looked at me weird.  "Were you expecting the President?  Pretty sure he’s busy."  She went to help Dad plate the ribs.  "You’re a funny guy sometimes, Jack.  But I love you anyway."

I nodded.  "I’m kinda handsome, too."  Everyone snorted.  I went to the bonus fridge for the beers.

\---

The next night, I was up late and the house phone rang.  "Hello," I said.

"I lied before," said the voice of the old lady.  "I think you should go in the shed."

"Don’t call here again," I told it.

"I can bring it to you," said the voice.  "If that’s more convenient."

I hung up.  It didn’t call back.

\---

That was a long time ago.  Today, Diffie’s married to a man she met at the food ministry.  His name’s Mark, and he’s a computer engineer.  His jokes aren’t very good, but I like the guy anyway.

Mom and Dad decided to downsize to a condo a couple of years ago, and my wife and I took over the farmhouse.  I am, after all, the trustee.  My folks visit often, and Dad especially likes watching me make my "big business deals" from his old study.

Diffie and Mark have three wonderful kids, two boys and a girl.  They love to play together out in the pastures.  I am the fun uncle, or so I flatter myself.

Sometimes when I go into town, I see a sagging yellow shed rotting in a field or peering over a fence.  It’s never in the same place twice.  The door is always cracked open, like it’s inviting me in.

That’s okay with me.  I have no plans to accept the invitation.  And if I ever worry that there is a price to be paid for what I did, I follow a very simple procedure.

I invite Diffie and Mark over for dinner,  and I look very well upon those three happy,  chubby faces smiling at me from across the table.  And I remember that if there is a price, I am very glad to have paid it.
