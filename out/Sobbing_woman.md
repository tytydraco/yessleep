This happened to me fairly recently about early ish this year it kind short and hasnâ€™t really impacted me really, itâ€™s just been on my mind.

Backstory: I live in a decently small ocean side town like not classified as a city and itâ€™s main residence is well off old white peoples who have gone in to retirement to live by the ocean or houses that are empty waiting for people to come down from the city during summer to stay in them for the holidays. So what Iâ€™m trying to say is this town is safe as all hell every body goes to sleep around 7pm and itâ€™s just empty I really like this because I normally walk around it regularly at about midnight and have not encountered a single soul not once.

This is Australia by the way summer is at the end of the year Iâ€™m in high school but I live a lone all most all of the time( just to set the mood )

anyway let me get to the point I was trying to get to sleep and for some reason I left my window open and thatâ€™s why this night I was able to hear this woman sob loudly, it was so distinct to the point where I could pinpoint the location where she could have been and she was close. And I donâ€™t mean cry and scream I wanna say sob because my first though was itâ€™s a fox they have this fucked up cry that sounds so much like a woman crying/screaming. this has tricked a lot of people and you may have seen posts and videos about it. 

I know this very well because Australia has a number of foxes and when camping I have heard this cry a lot of times. This fox idea of mine went real quickly because this was not a fox scream this was a human sob this terrified me and my reaction to this was to not react to it I believe what ever was making this sound wanted me to react, kind of a childish idea but after a while it stopped i was like cool Iâ€™m good but Iâ€™m not going to move and just go to sleep, right at that moment the sob changed it was a scream this time but more broken it was like the thing got desperate it wanted a reaction and got louder to do so. At the time I was still not reacting to  it I didnâ€™t move itâ€™s not like I was frozen in terror I just thought I canâ€™t do anything to stop this thing from sobbing even if I tried so why even get up if there was a chance this thing wanted me to get up. 

It tried a new method when it started scratching the opposite wall to me this was messed up I was fed up at this point and very disturbed I was telling my self it is just a coincidence that a fox I think starts screaming and the possums that live in my room start scratching at the same time, I donâ€™t really believe it was a possum because their every in and out also they squirm around frantically and only scratch the roof but for the first time it was scratching my wall itâ€™s never done this since. It continues to scratch and scream for a long time maybe to test me specifically or hoping for me to wake up but I didnâ€™t eventually it stop and did not try anything again I donâ€™t believe in paranormal mainly because itâ€™s not scientifically possible ðŸ¤“, but I canâ€™t explain this without chucking it up to a coincidence

I leave my window closed at night thanks to the attention deprived demon 
Also I did think some woman was getting murdered out there but I checked the next day but there was nothing btw I want to explain where the sound was coming from it was coming from the back of my house where my window faces I have a back garage so thereâ€™s this alleyway thing thatâ€™s where it was sobbing from also I live on the second story so if I look out from my window I probably could of seen it.
