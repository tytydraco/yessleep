I missed the last bus by less than a minute.

I watched it pull away from the curb, red lights shrinking into the dark, doors already sealed. I didn’t run after it. There wouldn’t have been a point. Once it goes, it goes.

The stop emptied out quickly after that. A couple of people muttered and walked off toward side streets. Within a minute, it was just me, the bench, and the low buzz of the streetlight overhead.

I checked my phone. No service. Seven percent battery.

That’s when I remembered the story.

It wasn’t something I’d ever taken seriously. Just something people mentioned when the conversation drifted late enough—half joking, half not. An urban legend about this route.

They said sometimes, after the last bus had already gone, another one would come.

Same line. Same number.

And you should never get on it.

I told myself I was tired. That my brain was filling the silence with junk. I sat down on the bench and waited, more out of habit than expectation.

That was when headlights swept across the pavement.

An engine idled softly as something large pulled up beside the stop.

A bus.

Clean. Quiet. Interior lights already on.

It looked normal. Too normal to feel wrong at first. The doors opened with a smooth, practiced fold. Warm yellow light spilled onto the sidewalk, cutting clean lines through the darkness.

I stood there longer than I should have.

Then I stepped on.

Inside, it felt like any other late-night bus. A few people scattered through the seats. No one talking. No one looking at anyone else. The doors closed behind me, and the bus pulled away.

For a while, everything stayed normal.

The engine hummed steadily beneath the floor. The lights overhead didn’t flicker. Outside, streets slid past in familiar stretches. I settled into my seat and let myself breathe.

That’s when I realized we weren’t slowing between stops.

Not much. Just enough that it felt… off.

Street names blurred past too quickly to read. The buildings outside stayed low and uniform, repeating in a way that made it hard to track distance. Every block looked almost like the last.

I looked toward the front.

A man near the window hadn’t moved since I got on. His head rested against the glass. In the reflection, his face looked flatter than it should have—features pressed slightly out of shape by the angle.

I shifted in my seat.

The bus kept going.

When I glanced forward again, the man had slid lower, posture folded in on itself. His head hung at an angle that made my neck ache just looking at it.

His reflection caught my eye.

It didn’t line up anymore.

The outline of his face looked smoothed over, like details had been rubbed away and never put back. When the bus rattled over a rough patch of road, his features smeared together for a second before settling again.

I looked away.

Across the aisle, a woman stood too straight, head tilted slightly to one side. Her mouth was closed, but the skin around it pulled tight, stretched thin, like it was holding something in.

No one spoke.

The space inside the bus felt smaller.

Not suddenly. Just closer than before.

When I shifted, my knees brushed the seat ahead of me. Someone stood behind my seat now—close enough that I could feel heat through the vinyl. When the bus swayed, they didn’t correct themselves. They let the movement carry them nearer.

I kept my eyes forward.

In the window, I caught reflections instead of faces. Movements that didn’t quite match. Blinks that lagged behind themselves.

At the next stop, more people got on.

There shouldn’t have been room.

They boarded anyway, stepping into spaces that hadn’t existed seconds earlier. Some of them barely resembled people now—faces smooth where eyes should have been, arms bending at angles that made my stomach turn.

They packed themselves in around me, breathing close.

The smell thickened. Damp. Sour. Metallic.

The bus didn’t stop for a long time after that.

Block after block slid past, all of it blurred and indistinct. My legs burned from holding still. My neck ached. Every time I looked away, the space around me closed in by another fraction.

They weren’t touching me.

Not yet.

But they were watching.

When the bus finally slowed, I felt it before I saw it. A shift in pitch. The engine easing like it already knew where it was going.

Light brightened through the windows.

A familiar curb came into focus. A bent bus stop sign under a flickering streetlight.

This one looked real.

The bus rolled closer. Around me, bodies leaned forward just enough to make it clear they were ready.

The doors opened.

Everything moved at once.

Not screaming. Not lunging. Just a sudden, violent loss of patience.

Bodies surged toward the front, compressing and folding into each other. Hands clawed for poles and missed. Faces pressed against the glass, features smearing and flattening as weight piled on behind them.

I was shoved to my feet.

Something struck my ribs. Another thing hit my shoulder and stuck there, joints bending wrong as it tried to move past me.

They weren’t trying to grab me.

They were trying to get out.

The doors began to close.

Pressure increased behind me, desperate now. I stumbled forward. My foot found the curb.

Cold air hit my face.

I fell out of the bus, hitting the pavement hard as the weight vanished all at once.

Behind me, the doors slammed shut.

The bus pulled away immediately.

No hesitation.

No one followed.

I lay there gasping, listening to the engine fade until the street felt impossibly empty. When I finally stood, the stop looked ordinary. Undamaged. Quiet.

I sat on the bench, hands shaking, telling myself it was shock.

That’s all this was.

Then headlights swept across the pavement.

An engine idled softly as a bus pulled up beside the stop.

Old. Empty.

Interior lights already on.

The doors opened.

And somewhere else in the city, I knew, someone was deciding whether to get on.
