I was 22 and was doing a lot of dating back then. Mostly girls I found on the apps, as my work schedule was chaotic and didn’t allow for many opportunities to meet someone organically. As I remember, a lot of people on the apps back then had at least a few screws loose. So I have no idea if this was some kind of prank, but this situation just feels…off. 

Anyway I was with this girl, Sarah. Sarah was a sweet girl, and pretty good in bed. I had met her on Okcupid. We had made it to about six weeks, and I was happy with how things were going. We hadn’t quite had a talk about becoming exclusive with eachother, but it was definitely on my mind when I got the following text:


Sarah: Hey. It has been nice getting to know you. Ultimately I think we just aren’t right for each other & should see other people. Please be well. 


It felt like a bucket of ice water had been dumped on my head. I didn’t whether to cry or start fuming. I started typing out a response when I saw three dots emerge at the bottom of the screen. 


They stayed there. 


They disappeared. 


They reappeared. 


They re-disappeared. 


They stayed re-disappeared. 


3 minutes later the message finally came through. 


Sarah: OMG. MY ROOMMMATE WROTE THAT. I AM SO SO SORRY. OMGGGGGG PLEAE DONT. ELUEVE THAT WAS ME. IM GOING TO KILL HER!!!


I checked the clock. 9:22 and already hammered. I didn’t know what the actual situation was but it was not getting resolved now, in her state, and I didn’t really feel like she deserved any response from me, at least not this moment. I put the phone on its charger and went to sleep. 


I woke up at 2:37 to a light coming out of my phone. I groggily reached over and grabbed it. 


143 messages from Sarah. 


I shook my head, not sure if I was awake or in some nightmare. 


I didn’t want to open my phone. 


But I did. 


What those 143 messages contained, I’ll never know. Probably some creative derivatives of “motherfucker” or “pussy” she decided to hurl at me when I didn’t respond to her. But when I opened the messaging app, it started at the bottom of the message trail. And after that, I was too afraid to scroll up. 


Sarah: ok. I did it. I killed her. 


Sarah: I killed my roommate. I hope you’re happy. 


Sarah: You’re next. 


I’ll remind you this was the middle of the night, and I had just been woken up by this message. I sat staring at the phone until the sun was fully up. Aware of everything around me. Every rustling, ever chittering, every gust of wind. When the sun was shining in my window I finally put the phone down. 


That was the last text. And the last time I ever heard from or saw Sarah. Once I finally got up the courage later that morning, I went to her house. The police were already there. She was gone, and so was her roommate. The other girls who lived there said they woke up and they had both disappeared, and no one knew anything about it or had heard or seen anything. I showed the cops the text message in case it could help. They didn’t seem to take it seriously though. As I was leaving, I heard one whisper to the other. “No blood, no signs of foul play…”


They opened a case on it, but I never checked up on it. I met my wife a few months later. Time moves on and you don’t think much about things like that. 


It could have all just been some prank. Maybe they showed up a few days later after an impromptu trip to the beach. Maybe they decided to run off, Thelma and Louise style, and cooked up this story to throw everyone off. But I would be lying if I said there haven’t been moments where I thought about that text and looked over both shoulders.
