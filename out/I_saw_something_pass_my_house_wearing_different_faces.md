This happened six years ago. Let me preface this by saying that I live in a fairly small town. It’s perfectly adequate to live here, and there hasn’t been much in the way of horrific crimes. That changed when I saw the man in the parka. I was bored sitting inside from the cold; it wasn’t even the ‘pretty’ kind of cold where snow covered the ground and made everything look nice. This was a damp, wet, cold that just makes bones ache. I was laid off, and while searching for a new job online, I decided to put down my laptop and look outside. 

It was overcast, dark, and the street was wet. All the neighboring houses have their Christmas stuff up early for the holidays. From my living room window, I saw someone walk down the street. Average build, five foot eight, and he wore a distinctive olive green parka with light gray sweatpants. His hood was up, but I could see his face; it was an old man with a scruffy beard and an unwieldy mustache. As he passed by the house, he turned to me and waved. I forgot my shades were open. I was embarrassed and felt really awkward about the whole thing. So I waved back with a fake smile.

He smiled back and went along his day. I checked my Facebook and saw that one of my friends had posted that her grandfather had been killed and asked everyone for prayers during their difficult time. I scrolled down and found out the local funeral home put up an obituary. The picture I saw posted was the man in the parka.

I was, understandably, freaked out. He’d just walked past my house and waved at me. I shrugged it off as a lookalike, and maybe even a small part of my brain thought I saw a ghost heading to his heavenly home. It was a nice thought. 

I saw the same olive-colored parka again the next night. This time, my blinds were closed, but I peeped through the slits to get a look at the person. I expected to see the old man's face again, but this time it was a woman. She looked to be in her thirties, with fair skin and a skunk stripe running to the side of her hair. She was pretty, a face you don't forget.

I saw that same face in another obituary online. Her name was Heather, and she was found dead in an alley downtown. Disembowled. The suspect was still at large. 

The next night, I waited for it to pass by again; this time, it wore the face of a child. Same body shape, height, and size. But with a little boy's face stuck underneath the hoodie. It tripped on a piece of uneven sidewalk and tumbled face-first. It caught itself, but something plopped out onto the pavement. It was the face, crumpled up like a slimy piece of deli sliced ham. It scrambled, searching for it with panicked winter gloves until it found it and gripped it. The thing rose to its feet, draping the flesh over...whatever was under there.

I called 9-11 to report what I saw. It matched the disappearance of a boy named Will. They came, filed a report, and looked for anyone matching this description. They came up empty-handed but found Will in a creekbed. His neck was twisted the whole way around. They issued a public notice, warning people to beware of a man wearing an olive-colored parka. It was, unfortunately, all they could work from. 

Weeks passed, and nothing turned up. And for a while, things started feeling normal again.

My friend Julia was supposed to stop by and drop off a book she wanted me to read. We dated for a time, but it never materialized into a full relationship; we remained close friends. We even had our own little book club. One day, I told her we'd make a trade and swap books from our own personal collections. She wanted me to read **Vineland**, and I wanted her to read **I Am Legend.** So, I waited for her and heard the strong winds creak the wood in my house. I was beginning to feel myself fighting sleep when I heard a knock at the door. I looked at my phone’s clock; she was thirty minutes late. I looked through the peephole and found Julia staring at me, smiling.

“I made it! It’s crazy out there!”

“I bet, give me a second, I gotta grab the book from my room.”

“Sure, take your time, I’m just freezing my ass off out here.”

I chuckled at her snarky comment, but as I grabbed the book from my room, my phone rumbled. It was a text from my Mom.

*CAN WE TALK?*

There were two modes of thought that overtook my mind. Either I’ve pissed my Mom off somehow, or something bad happened. I texted back,

*YES*

My phone began to ring, and I answered. I was walking back to the door, I said.

“Hello?”

“Honey, are you sitting down?” She said,

That made my blood chill. I stiffened,

“What’s wrong?”

“It’s Julia, honey, she’s…”

“Mom, it’s fine. She’s-“

“…Honey, she’s gone. Police found her in a dumpster this afternoon. I’m so sorry, baby.”

I looked through the peephole and looked at Julia’s clothing. Grey sweatpants, an olive green parka, and in her hands was a copy of Vineland with flecks of blood on the cover. She spoke from outside,

“Everything okay? It’s freezing out here.”

I listened to my Mom’s sniffling and her shaky voice trying to explain the situation. 

“Said an employee at the pawn shop downtown was breaking down cardboard boxes when they saw…they saw blood coming out of the dumpster. I’m so sorry, honey.”

I was silent, transfixed on the warped fish-eyed perspective of Julia’s face. She seemed completely normal, she looked around, and fidgeted with the book in her hands. It was completely ordinary. I whispered into the phone,

“Hey, Mom, I want you to call the police. I…I think he’s here. The person in the parka, the killer.”

Her tone got more serious,

"Lock the door, hide, and protect yourself. I love you."

I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a meat cleaver. I returned to the door and locked the chain latch. Then I heard from outside,

"What's the holdup?"

I froze. It spoke again,

"C'mon, let me in, it's cold."

I talked back to it, asking,

"Hey, Julia?"

"Yeah?"

"I think I lost my book, sorry."

"It's okay, you can still borrow mine, now open up."

The door handle jiggled.

"Julia, I hate to be rude, but-"

"Yeah, you're being fucking rude, I'm cold, and I'm holding the book in my hands, why not just crack the door open and take the fucking thing?"

"You're being mean, Jules, you've never-"

"OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR!"

The door pounded. 

*THUD! THUD! THUD!* 

I clutched the cleaver in my hand as she assaulted the door. I looked through the peephole and saw only blackness. It was covering the hole. I thought about running, but I stood my ground, holding the cleaver with a white knuckle grip. I screamed,

"Get the fuck out of here!"

I kept waiting for it to kick down the door, deadbolt and chain latch snapping away, but for some reason, it just stopped. I waited, and waited, but the home invasion never came. I heard footsteps walk away from the door and down my steps. I needed to see if it was gone. I checked the peephole and found nothing at the door. I rushed to my living room window and peeked through the blinds, hoping to get a glimpse of whatever this thing was, instead of seeing the thing with the parka down the street, or just not there entirely.

It was pressed against the window. 

That's when I realized that this thing wasn't covering the peephole. The darkness that encapsulated the glass hole was its face. It was a void of blackness, infinite, endless, and unnatural. 

I screamed, and then it bolted into the night. Minutes later, I heard the sirens. I didn't open the door until I saw the flashing lights entering my driveway. I opened the door to greet the officers when I slipped on something beneath my feet. Something greasy and rubbery. 

It was Julia's face; it left it behind alongside her book.
