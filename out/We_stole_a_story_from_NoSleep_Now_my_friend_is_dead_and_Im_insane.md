It started out so well. Me and my mate, we had a great little side hustle going on. We'd lurk on /r/NoSleep, find the best stories on there, and nick them. Next, we'd bodge together some amdram narration, creepy music, stock images and a bit of animation, stick it all up on YouTube, and let the hits flood in. 

Sometimes, you got a copyright strike and your channel was shut down. But all we needed to do was create a new one, re-upload our old vids with a few tweaks, and the scam continued.

What do you mean we were doing something wrong? You're stupid enough to stick it up here in the first place. Hey, what can I say? Property is theft, which must mean theft is property. As long as you're the sucked and not the sucker, know what I mean? Most of you lot can't write for toffee anyway. We were doing you losers a favour.

Anyway, we found this great story. About a woman who kept giving birth to mantises. The twist being that she and her 'babies' kept feeding on the men who knocked her up. OK, sounds a bit weird, but it read well.

So me and my mate got recording. He's not the best falsetto in the world. But it was either that or hire an underfed BAPA slumming it at Starbucks to do the voice of the Mantis Woman. I was particularly proud of the crunching noises, where the baby mantises and Mum gobble up their latest victim. It was me, eating crisps.

The video went live, and the hits started rolling in. We'd had a lucky streak, as YouTube hadn't issued a copyright strike in ages. So the revenue began to trickle in too. Not that much, of course. But enough to keep us in Moroccan resin, care of our old mate, Spliffy. It was not like this was our day job.

But I digress. 

Anyway, I got a private message in my Reddit folder a few days later. It was from the author. One word.  Nothing else.  

**DON'T.**

I shrugged and pressed delete. It's the Web. Everything's free, and if it's not, we'll take it anyway, yeah?

So, we skinned up and got boozed at my bedsit that night. My mate was claiming he was going to find out where the author lived, and piss through their letterbox. I laughed, but sometimes he does creepy things, you know. Like that ex of his he wouldn't leave alone until the police got involved. All because he left a dead rat on her doorstep! Stupid cow, over-reacting like that. She knew what she was getting into. Speaking as a lady's man, I get them drunk, shag them, and dump them. It saves a lot of time.

He passed out on the sofa, so I staggered off to the sweet warmth of bed. 

But it must have been the booze or the ganja, 'cos that night I had some strange, anxious dreams. I dreamt my vision was... Weird, like seeing 100 versions of the same thing. The sunlight poking through the curtains was less glaring. All the colours were muted, and everything moved much slower. I could, I dunno, *feel* the air, and everything that moved in it. I could feel my friend. He'd just staggered up, off from the sofa.

It was strange. The dream had me chasing him around the room, and he was screaming. He tried stabbing me with a breadknife and beating me off with a broom handle, but my chitin stopped him hurting me. I remember finally cornering him, and he was soon caught in my big, strong arms...

It got even blurrier then. Wet. Crunching, but with no crisps. Screams, then gasps, then nothing. And gnawing. Gnawing and gnawing and gnawing. The flutter of wings. The twitch of antenna... I can't remember much else.

The police kicked the door down, and found me drenched in blood and worse, bits of my mate scattered across the flat. I dimly remember being dragged out and being put into the van, then nothing again, before I came to in the secure unit. Finally, I meekly bent over while the nurse gave me another shot of sedative.

This was no dream.

They say I'm mad, that I killed and ate my friend in a psychotic episode. There was enough THC and booze in my system to zonk out an elephant, but I'm not so sure that's the cause. I've been a recreational user since I was 14. Something else happened. When I found out, I begged them to pump my stomach, and they didn't take too much prompting.

Let's just say they found plenty of extra evidence.

I've managed to get a smartphone smuggled in, just to keep me occupied and stop going properly mad. It cost an absolute fortune. Robbing bastards.

Weird, isn't it, that I'm posting this on NoSleep? I bet some bastard will rip me off and stick this up on their shitty YouTube channel. 

They're going to try me soon, and the odds are, I'm never leaving Broadmoor. I heard rumours that what was left of my friend didn't look like it was eaten by human teeth. But I doubt a jury will ever hear that. I'm going down.

But that's not the worst of it. I feel something... Moving inside me. Some things. I realise now that I didn't just eat my friend. I did something else. Something somehow worse. Far worse.

It's beginning to hurt, like dozens of tiny needles jabbing into my insides. They're trying to get out. And they're hungry, so very hungry.

I think I'm pregnant.
