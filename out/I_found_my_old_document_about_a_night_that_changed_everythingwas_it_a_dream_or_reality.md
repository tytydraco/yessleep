(Part one 2/4/25)

I’ve been debating posting this for a long time. When I was younger I experienced something that I thought may have been a dream. Though at the moment of it happening I did not, I eventually just pushed it down. This is what I wrote a few years after it happened as a way to cope and just a way to ask for help. I did not end up posting anything because I did not feel like I should. I have been contemplating on going back. I will give an update in a few days.

It was October 1997

We were supposed to meet under the Old Bridge at midnight. It felt strange there, with all the trash and empty needles scattered around. I muttered quietly to myself, the anxiety swelling over me. He never showed up. Frustrated, I started heading home. As I got on my bike, I noticed the chain had fallen off. I felt a burst of anger, but I fixed it and kept going.

When I got to my house and went inside, I saw my father asleep in the reclining chair in the living room. I went upstairs, jumped into bed, and fell into an exhausted sleep from all the biking. The next morning, I woke up to my mother hollering my name. She said my friend was calling me on the phone. I ran downstairs to answer, hurriedly picking up.

He said, “Sorry, I fell off my bike and hurt my knee. I was closer to my house, so I just went back.”

I was frustrated. “Why would you go back? You knew how important last night was supposed to be.” I hung up angrily, and my mother walked in, asking why I was upset. I didn’t respond and ran back to my room.

I noticed something odd as I entered. There was a piece of paper stuck to the outside of my window, slightly cracked open from last night. I tried to open the window, but it wouldn’t budge. After a few minutes of struggling, I finally managed to open it and grabbed the paper. The writing was faint, barely legible, but pressed hard enough that it was readable. The handwriting was bad, almost childlike.

The note said, “Hello Anthony \*\*\*\*\*\*.” My heart skipped a beat. Anthony was my name, but I figured it must have been my friend who put the note there as a joke. I went downstairs to call him. I dialed his number, but he didn’t answer. Why wouldn’t he pick up? I thought to myself.

A few hours passed without any word from him. I heard a knock on the front door. My mother answered, “Hello, Erik. I heard you fell. Is your knee okay? Do you need an ice pack?”

Erik said he was fine and didn’t need an ice pack, but thanked her anyway. He asked if he could come upstairs to talk to me. My mom agreed, and soon Erik was in my room. We had been friends for years, but this was the first time he’d been to my house. We talked for a while, and eventually, I asked if he wanted to go to the bridge to talk. He agreed.

We stayed late at my house because he didn’t have power at his place someone had crashed into a utility pole, knocking out power for his entire street. We waited in my living room, playing on the new SNES my mother had bought for me. My dad and I loved to play video games together on weekends, so Erik and I passed the time until my parents fell asleep, sneaking out without them noticing.

I grabbed my bike, and Erik noticed the chain had fallen off. “Same thing happened earlier,” I muttered, annoyed. “I don’t know why it keeps doing that.” I fixed it, and we headed to the Old Bridge.

Halfway there, I saw a man standing on the edge of the woods, Erik didn’t seem to notice. He seemed harmless enough, but the anxiety crept up again, so I asked Erik if we could go faster. He said sure.

When we reached the bridge, it was later than we expected. We sat down, and Erik said, “Why did you want to meet here? Couldn’t we talk at your house?”

I shivered, my voice unsteady. “There were too many people at my house, or anywhere else.”

We sat in silence, cold as the surrounding night. Then I remembered the note I had found. I felt it in my pocket when I was grabbing my Walkman. I pulled it out and handed it to Erik, asking, “Why’d you put this on my window?”

“That wasn’t me,” he said, his voice was calm, my heart dropped.

A cold shiver ran down my spine. There was no one else who would’ve put a note on my window for no reason. Why was he lying to me? I said nothing, instead pulling out my Walkman and playing some music. Classical music always helped with my anxiety.

I started to hear something strange like a scream, followed by a crash. Erik didn’t seem bothered. “It’s nothing,” he reassured me. “Don’t worry about it. It’s probably a fox.”

Erik, being the younger of us, knew how to handle my panic attacks. He wasn’t worried about the sound, so he walked toward the woods to investigate. “Come on, it’s fine,” he called back.

I stayed behind, still terrified. I didn’t want to get trampled by a moose or something. Erik ventured further into the woods until I couldn’t see him anymore.

Ten minutes passed. Then twenty. He still wasn’t back. I started to panic, hearing a familiar scream from the woods. “IT’S ERIK!” I shouted. I ran, my legs barely working, my heart racing. I couldn’t find him. The scream stopped. Erik was gone.

Then, I heard a loud crash from the woods, followed by footsteps heavy, fast, and unnervingly close. I couldn’t stop running, my legs burning from exhaustion, my heart pounding in my chest. I saw him. Erik, standing there, staring at me. Without warning, I collapsed.

I woke up in the woods, pain in my back. The sun was barely peeking through the trees. The woods felt strange, unnatural, like a dream. But I wasn’t dreaming. I just knew it was not a dream.

On a tree beside me, I saw another note just like the one on my window. Only this one said “Micheal.” I looked around. Notes were pinned to every tree. Antonin, Giovanni, Alfredo names I didn’t recognize.

Confused, I heard footsteps. I ran, searching for somewhere to hide. In the distance, I saw a hole that looked like something from the Vietnam War. I crawled into it, trembling. The footsteps were getting closer. I held my breath, my heart pounding. Then I brushed something cold and hard. I looked down. It wasn’t a rock.

It was a skull!

I froze, hands shaking, as the footsteps drew nearer. Every step felt like it was shaking the ground. I couldn’t move. The footsteps stopped.

Was it leaving?

I slowly crawled out of the hole, looking around. Nothing. But then footsteps again. Coming closer. I fell to my knees, giving up. I had no food, no water, and no chance of survival. I closed my eyes, ready for it to end.

But then a hand covered my mouth, pulling me back into the hole. I gasped for air as a man’s voice whispered, “If you try that again, I’ll kill you myself.”

He uncovered my face so I could breathe, but made sure I said nothing. He was an older man who looked about 40. He was tall and muscular and he had a spear. He whispered in a shallow almost lifeless voice, “Do not speak loudly, it can hear you from afar.” 

“What was that? Who are you? Where is my friend? where are we?”

The walls shook. The whole world trembled. A deep, pulsing thrum vibrated through the floor, through my bones. The knocking had turned to pounding. Each slam of the hatch sent a jolt through my ribs.

I staggered back, breath coming fast. My skin was peeling, flaking, curling like charred paper. It didn't hurt. That was worse.

Erik’s voice seeped through the metal. Low. Amused. “You don’t belong here.” The hatch buckled. A crack split through the rusted surface. Then, something burst through. A hand. Not Erik’s. Too long. Too many joints. Nails curved like claws.

I ran. The man lunged, caught my arm. His grip was iron. “You can never escape!”

I tore free, sprinting down the tunnel. The walls pulsed, breathing, closing in. They weren’t walls. Not really. Flesh-like, shifting. My skin burned, flaking away in the heat. I wasn’t. supposed to be here. I wasn’t supposed to be here. Then light.

Blinding. White-hot. A crack in the dark, widening, splitting reality open. A way out. I didn’t hesitate. I dove.

Cold slammed into me, knocking the breath from my lungs. I gasped, but nothing came. My body twisted, weightless, falling. Then silence. I was on my back. Grass beneath me. Wind in my hair. Stars overhead. 

I just sat there, for almost an hour, thinking about what just happened. “Why did this happen to me?” I walked to my bike and got on to ride home. I peddled as quickly as I could. I was scared, crying from terror. I kept peddling even after my legs felt like they fell off.

I got home and whipped the tears off my face and tried to stop crying because I did not want my parents to see me cry. I opened the door and walked to my room quickly. Luckily my parents did not see me walk in and I did not get caught.

I  walked to my room and just laid down for hours, thinking.



(2/4/25)

I just yesterday found this document I wrote. Things do not seem to add up. I think I might go back. I don’t know how I will or if it is even real. Really could have just been a hallucination but I don’t know. I remember it so vividly and so realistically. I really feel like it was not a dream now. I felt pain, I felt sadness. I remember every detail which is unusual for my dreams.
