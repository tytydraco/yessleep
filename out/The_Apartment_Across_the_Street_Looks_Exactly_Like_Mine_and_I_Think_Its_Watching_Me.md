I moved into this apartment a month ago. It wasn’t much—just a small one-bedroom on the third floor of an old building that had seen better days. The rent was cheap for the area, and I’d been looking for something affordable and cozy. I had my own space, my own routine, and that was exactly what I wanted. No roommates, no noise, just me, a few cigarettes and my beloved cat Chicken Nugget, who I adopted last fall.

The apartment had a certain charm, though it was hard to pinpoint exactly what created the illusion of the same. The walls were a pale butter yellow, and the ceilings heavily popcorned. A combination that reminded me of the hungover mornings I spent at my aunt's mismatched home. A monstrosity that often looked like adorable bits of patchwork sewn together, had somehow come to life and now resembled something close to a cottage.

The hardwood floors creaked under my feet, especially in the hallway, but that only made it feel more lived-in. The kitchen was small, but the sunlight that streamed in through the window in the mornings made up for the lack of space. I spent hours organizing my spices, placing my coffee mugs just so, trying to make it feel as homey as possible. I even painted the cabinets a soft mint green, something I’d seen on Pinterest, and added little gold handles to make them feel special. It was a small thing, but it made me feel accomplished, like I was doing life right.

The living room was where I spent most of my time. It had the best light in the apartment. I’d rearranged the furniture a few times before settling on a cozy setup—a cream-colored sofa with throw pillows in muted shades of pink and mustard yellow. The rug I found at a flea market had this faded floral pattern, and though it wasn’t perfect, it brought the room together. I spent an afternoon putting up fairy lights around the window, a little touch to make it feel magical when the night came.

It wasn’t perfect, but it was mine. I loved it.

At first, I didn’t even notice the apartment across the street. The building was an old brownstone, just like mine, with narrow windows and ivy creeping up the sides. It had been vacant when I moved in, and I’d seen no sign of life from behind the windows. But then, one night, after I’d finished unpacking the last of the boxes, I glanced out the window and saw a light. A warm, golden glow. I thought it was strange. The apartment had been empty, hadn’t it? But I shrugged it off. People forget to turn off lights all the time.

The next night, the light was still there. And this time, I saw something more—a figure, sitting still, staring into the dim room. I could barely make it out from the distance, but I was sure it was a person. A person in the same position, in the same place. I wasn’t sure what to think of it, so I decided it was probably nothing. I was new to the neighborhood. Maybe the place across the street had a resident now. Or maybe it was just someone who left the light on by accident.

But the next few nights, the figure was still there. It was always the same—a silhouette in the soft light. Sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, but always in the same spot. The longer I looked, the more uncomfortable I felt, like there was something about it that didn’t quite add up. Still, I ignored it. I was just being paranoid. There was nothing strange about a person sitting in their window.

One evening, a week or so later, I was sitting on my couch, scrolling through my phone, when I looked up and saw something that made my heart skip a beat. The apartment across the street—the one with the figure—had changed. The blinds were open a little wider than usual. I could see into the apartment now, and there it was.

The furniture.

It was identical.

The couch, the same shade of cream as mine, only it was a little more worn around the edges, like it had been used more. The rug, though smaller, was the same faded floral pattern. The coffee table—exactly like the one in my living room—dark wood with the same little scratches on its surface. The lamp in the corner, with the same brass base. The throw pillows, the same muted pink and mustard yellow.

I felt my stomach drop. There was no way. No way that could be a coincidence.

I stood up from the couch, pressing my forehead against the window as I looked across the street, trying to see more. But the figure was still there, sitting in front of the window. This time, I could see them more clearly. A woman, perhaps in her mid-thirties, with long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail. She was looking straight ahead, her back rigid. I couldn’t see her face, but something about her posture reminded me of myself when I was lost in thought, staring out the window, just trying to exist in the moment. 

I didn’t know what to think. Maybe she was just like me—another person, trying to make her space feel like home. Maybe it was nothing. But something about it felt… off.

Over the next few days, I became more and more obsessed with the apartment across the street. I found myself peeking through the blinds at night, trying to see what they were doing. Every time I looked, the apartment looked more and more like mine. The same placement of furniture, the same colors, the same little details. It was like I was looking into a mirror that shouldn’t have existed. Even the kitchen, the way the sink was placed in front of the window, and the shelf I had mounted above it to hold my plants—it was all the same.

One afternoon, I decided to try and distract myself. I grabbed some paint and a brush and began to touch up the trim around the windows. It had gotten a little chipped, and I wanted everything to look fresh. The idea of making my place *nicer* soothed me. The yellow walls seemed warmer in the sunlight, the mint green cabinets looked a little more polished, and the plants on the windowsill made it feel like a little garden. I worked slowly, making sure each stroke was perfect. When I was done, I stood back and admired the little details. It wasn’t just a place to live—it felt like a reflection of me. 

That evening, when I sat on the couch with a cup of tea, I glanced out the window again, almost against my will. The apartment across the street—again, the blinds were open wider than usual, and I could see inside more clearly.

There it was.

The exact same trim, freshly painted. The same plants on the windowsill, sitting in the same spots. The same yellow walls. The same mint green cabinets, the same vase on the counter. Everything was just… *right*. Too right.

And the figure? She was sitting there, too, but this time, her head was tilted, like she was looking directly at me. For a long moment, I just stood there, heart pounding in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. It was like she was staring into my soul, as if she knew I was looking, as if she knew I’d *noticed*.

I stepped back from the window, trembling, my thoughts spinning. How could this be? I’d never been inside that apartment. I couldn’t have. There was no way she could have all the same furniture, all the same details, right down to the same color paint.

I had to see it for myself.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. That *she* was wrong. So, the next day, I crossed the street, heart racing with every step. I don’t know why I did it—I just needed to. Maybe I thought I could find an explanation. Maybe I thought I was being foolish.

I reached the door, and my hand hesitated over the handle. I don’t even know why I was nervous. I was just going to knock. Just going to see who lived there. But when I twisted the handle and pushed open the door, the room inside was… empty. The walls were bare. The furniture was gone. 

I stood there, confused. My heart was racing. The apartment across the street wasn’t just familiar—it was *empty*.

And as I turned to leave, I heard it. A voice, soft and whispering, coming from the empty room.

"Welcome Home"
