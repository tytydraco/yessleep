The air was thick with the scent of roasting corn and burning pine, the smoke curling into the dusk like a slow exhale. Lanterns hung from the wooden posts that lined the village square, their glow swaying in the breath of the evening breeze. Children ran between the tables, bare feet kicking up dust, their laughter carrying high into the gathering night.

Tonight was The Binding, and the village was alive with it.

I stood at the edge of the square, where the road turned from packed dirt to the first tangled fingers of the woods. From here, I could see everything—the clusters of families passing plates, the elders seated at their long, knotted table, and Lena at the center of it all.

She sat among the other girls, hands folded neatly in her lap, her white dress catching the lantern light. She wasn’t like the others—wasn’t giggling nervously or casting quick glances at the thickening treeline. No, Lena was calm. Too calm.

She was smiling.

I crossed the square, the earth packed firm beneath my boots. The conversations shifted as I passed—hushed, reverent. People nodded and murmured my name. They knew my place in this. I was The Watcher this year.

I reached Lena just as she pulled a piece of bread apart with careful fingers. She looked up at me, her eyes bright.

“Uncle,” she said, voice even. Not scared. Not uncertain.

“Hey, kid.” I crouched beside her, dropping my voice low. “You feeling alright?”

She tilted her head, studying me like children did when they sensed something in you that you didn’t want to show. “You’re nervous,” she said.

“I just want to make sure you’re okay.”

Lena’s smile didn’t falter. “I’m okay.”

I glanced toward the elders’ table. They were watching us—watching her.

“You can still say no,” I said, barely above a whisper.

Lena’s expression didn’t change, but her hands tightened in her lap. “You know I can’t.”

She was right. None of the girls had ever refused. None of them ever would.

I swallowed, looking past her to where the trees loomed just beyond the last house. The wind shifted, and for a moment, I swore I smelled something deeper than pine and earth. Something damp and old.

A hand clapped my shoulder. Pastor Callum.

“Walk with me,” he said.



The two of us moved through the festival as the music started—fiddles and stomping feet, the kind of sound that made the blood hum. People danced, their shadows leaping high against the walls. But I wasn’t watching them.

I was watching the tree.

It stood at the far edge of the square, just before the land dipped toward the hollow. The Binding Tree. Gnarled and towering, its bark dark as old blood, slick in places where the moss clung too thick. The roots sprawled out like the ribs of some great beast.

Tomorrow, Lena would be tied there.

“She’s strong,” Callum said beside me.

“She’s twelve,” I replied.

The pastor only smiled, his lined face creasing in the lantern glow. “And yet, she does not fear it.”

I stared at the tree. The knots in its bark looked too much like a face, like something frozen mid-scream.

“None of them ever do,” I murmured.

Callum exhaled slowly. “Because it is an honor.”

I didn’t answer.

Because if that was true, then why did the village always feel so damn quiet the morning after?

Why did the girls always come back changed?

And why, when I turned back toward Lena, did I see the elder women kneeling beside her, twisting ribbons into her hair—red, like fresh wounds—and whispering words too soft for me to hear?

-----------------------------------------------

The night stretched wide and starless, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and pine resin. The village had gone quiet. No more music. No more laughter. Just the soft shuffle of feet as we moved in procession toward the hollow.

The Binding Tree loomed ahead, black against the sky, its branches like outstretched limbs, gnarled fingers tangled in the night. The wind was low, but the tree swayed, its great trunk groaning like something waking from a deep sleep.

Lena walked ahead of me, barefoot, white dress brushing against her knees. She didn’t shiver. Didn’t look back.

She was not afraid.

The village elders led the way, torches held high, their flames bending like something drawn toward the tree. Behind them, the women carried the ropes—thick and frayed, darkened with age and something else, something that made my gut twist.

The men trailed behind, their faces solemn, their hands empty.

We did not carry weapons.

We never did.

At the clearing, the villagers fanned out, circling the tree. No one spoke. This was the moment when words no longer mattered.

Lena stepped forward, tilting her head back to look at the tree. I followed her gaze. From a distance, the bark looked smooth, but up close, it was rough with deep grooves—scars that ran down the length like old wounds, half-healed and forgotten. I had seen this tree my whole life, and yet, standing here now, it felt different.

It felt awake.

Pastor Callum stepped forward, lifting his hands.

“We bind the land to the living.”

The villagers echoed the words.

Lena knelt before the tree. The elder women moved in unison, winding the first length of rope around her wrists, knotting them with slow, practiced hands.

I watched them work, watched how Lena’s breath stayed steady and how her eyes remained fixed on something I could not see.

The second rope went around her ankles. The third around her waist. Each binding was tight but not cruel.

The tree must hold her. But it must not hurt her.

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “Lena—”

She turned her head, just enough to look at me. The firelight caught the edge of her face, turning her eyes to molten gold.

She smiled.

My gut turned. She shouldn’t be smiling.

The last knot was pulled tight, and the elder women stepped back, their heads bowed.

Callum approached the tree, holding out a bowl of thick, blackened water. He dipped his fingers in, dragging them down the bark in three long strokes.

The tree shuddered.

The villagers did not move.

“We bind the land to the living,” Callum said again, softer now.

The villagers whispered the words.

Lena closed her eyes.

And then, just as the last torch was lowered, the wind changed.

The air turned thick and wrong, the smell of the woods sharp and unnatural—wet rot and something deeper, something old.

A low sound moved through the trees, not quite a howl or groan.

The fire wavered.

The ground beneath us felt too soft, too loose.

And then it was over.

Lena opened her eyes.

She was still smiling.

Callum nodded, stepping back. The elders followed one by one, turning away from the tree.

The villagers moved silently, retreating into the woods, their figures swallowed by the dark.

I hesitated.

Just for a moment.

Just long enough to watch Lena—bound to the tree, bathed in moonlight, utterly still.

She did not call out. Did not ask us to stay.

She only watched.

And when I finally turned away, I swore I heard it—

A voice, soft and distant, whispering from within the tree.

-----------------------------------------------

The forest was breathing.

Not in the way the wind moves through branches or night settles heavily over the earth. No—this was something more profound. Something slow and deliberate. Like the trees themselves were inhaling, exhaling.

I stood just beyond the clearing, hidden in the shadow of the underbrush, the damp scent of pine and turned soil thick in my throat. The village had gone. The last torch had vanished down the path, swallowed by the dark.

It was just me now.

Me, the tree, and Lena.

She was still where we left her—tied to the trunk, bathed in pale moonlight, utterly still. The ropes pressed into her dress, her wrists bound tight against the bark.

She didn’t struggle. She didn’t shiver.

She just watched.

I shifted my weight, my boots sinking slightly into the soft loam. The forest should have been full of sound—crickets, the rustle of wind through leaves, the distant hoot of an owl.

But it was silent.

Too silent.

I exhaled slow, adjusting the strap of my rifle against my shoulder. The gun wasn’t loaded. Never was. The Watcher’s job wasn’t to protect the girl—it was to bear witness.

To make sure it happened the way it was supposed to.

Lena tilted her head slightly, and my pulse kicked against my ribs.

She was looking at me.

I swallowed hard, glancing toward the tree. The ropes held firm. The knots hadn’t moved.

She couldn’t see me. She shouldn’t be able to see me.

I stepped back, my foot pressing into the damp ground.

Somewhere, far beyond the clearing, a branch snapped.

The sound was sharp, like bone breaking.

I turned toward the woods, rifle lifting instinctively—but there was nothing. Just blackness, stretching deep and endless between the trunks.

The wind shifted.

The scent hit me all at once—something damp, something rich and sour, like wet earth mixed with the copper tang of blood. It curled at the back of my throat, thick as oil.

I turned back to the clearing.

Lena was still watching me.

No. Not watching.

Listening.

She tilted her head slightly like she was hearing something I wasn’t.

And then—the tree groaned.

A slow, low sound deep in its roots.

Like something stirring.

I gripped the rifle tight, every muscle in my body locking stiff. The wind was rising now, shifting through the clearing, making the edges of Lena’s dress flutter like moth wings. The branches creaked overhead, their twisting limbs blotting out pieces of the moon.

And then—

Footsteps.

Soft. Slow.

Coming from the trees.

I turned my head, breath stuck high in my throat. The rifle trembled in my hands.

The footsteps stopped.

Silence.

But the trees were still breathing.

I exhaled slowly, cold sweat crawling down my spine. The ritual always felt wrong, but this was something else. Something off.

I looked back at Lena.

Her lips had parted slightly. Not in fear. Not in pain.

In wonder.

The wind pushed through the clearing again, rustling the ropes. The tree shuddered.

I stepped back, pulse hammering. The ground beneath my boots felt softer and looser than before.

And then—

A whisper.

Faint, distant.

From the tree.

Lena’s eyes fluttered shut.

She smiled.

The forest was breathing.

And somewhere, just beneath the roots, something else was, too.

-----------------------------------------------

Dawn came slow, dragging itself over the trees like something half-dead. The sky was a bruised yellow, the light weak and thin, casting long, sickly shadows over the clearing.

I stood at the edge of the tree line, watching. Waiting.

The village was coming.

I could hear them—the low murmur of voices, the rhythmic shuffle of feet against the dirt path. The sound carried in the heavy morning air, thick with the scent of damp earth and the stale, lingering traces of burnt pine from last night’s torches.

But the clearing itself was silent.

No birds. No wind.

Just her.

Lena.

She was still bound to the tree, just as we had left her. The ropes dug deep into her wrists, the frayed fibers pressed into the soft fabric of her white dress.

But something was wrong.

I could feel it, thick in my throat, sticky as tar.

I took a slow step forward, boots pressing into the loose earth.

She should be awake. She should be smiling.

That was how it always happened. Every girl before her had opened her eyes at first light, untouched and unshaken, her lips curling in that strange, knowing smile.

But Lena wasn’t smiling.

She wasn’t moving at all.

The village reached the clearing, their voices trailing into silence. A few gasps. A low murmur of confusion. Then nothing.

Someone pushed past me—Pastor Callum.

His robe swayed as he stepped forward, slow and careful. He knelt beside Lena, one hand reaching for her face.

His fingers touched her skin.

He froze.

I watched his throat bob as he swallowed hard. His hand shook as he moved it lower, grasping the edge of the rope. He gave it a slight tug, expecting it to unravel easily—but it didn’t.

It was stiff. Brittle.

Wrong.

I stepped closer, my breath shallow, my heart pounding hard against my ribs.

Something was growing in my chest—a cold, curdled feeling, like sour milk twisting in my stomach.

Something was wrong.

Pastor Callum gave the rope another tug—and it snapped.

A dry, cracking sound, like dead twigs snapping underfoot.

I flinched.

Callum stumbled back, the broken length of rope clenched tight in his fist. His breath had gone shallow. His face had gone pale.

And then—

Lena’s head lolled forward.

My throat tightened. I stepped forward, reaching for her.

The moment my fingers touched her skin, I knew.

She was cold.

Not the kind of cold you get from a night in the woods. Not the kind of cold that fades when the sun touches your skin.

This was deeper.

This was the cold of something left too long in the earth.

The cold of something that shouldn’t be.

A sharp breath behind me. A murmur from the crowd.

And then—

A woman screamed.

Lena’s head tilted back against the tree, her face turned toward the rising sun.

Her eyes were open.

Her mouth was parted.

And she was smiling.

But it was not a living smile.

It was stretched too wide, and the corners of her lips pulled so tight they had cracked, leaving thin lines of dried blood against her pale skin.

And her eyes—

Her eyes were wrong.

They were still bright, still golden in the morning light. But they were empty.

Hollow.

Like she wasn’t looking at anything at all.

The village stood frozen, the weight of silence pressing down over them.

Then, from somewhere in the crowd, a single, shaking voice:

"The Binding… failed.”

The words crawled through my skull, heavy and leaden, like something I had always feared but never spoken aloud.

The land was not bound.

And now, it was loose.

-----------------------------------------------

The screaming didn’t last long.

It cut off the moment Pastor Callum rose to his feet, his expression drawn tight, his hands trembling at his sides. The village stood in stunned silence, the weight of it pressing down like a held breath. No one moved. No one spoke. The air was thick with the scent of damp bark and something else—something sour, something wrong.

Lena was still smiling.

Her head lolled slightly to one side, the ropes hanging loose around her wrists now, frayed and brittle as old sinew. Her dress, once bright white, looked stained in places—not with blood, but with something darker, like rot, spreading from where the tree had held her.

And then, Callum whispered it.

A breath of a thing. A curse. A confession.

“The Binding has failed.”

The moment the words left his lips, the stillness broke.

Voices rose, sharp and frantic. A woman pulled her child close, turning his face away. A man backed away from the clearing, his boots kicking up loose earth as he stumbled. Someone else sobbed, low and shaking.

The elders did not move.

I did.

I stepped toward Callum, my throat tight, my stomach curdling like old milk. “What does that mean?”

He didn’t look at me. He was still staring at Lena—at her face, at her unnatural, blood-stiff smile.

“Callum.” My voice came out harder now, sharp with something close to anger. “What does it mean?”

The old man exhaled slowly. When he finally turned to me, his eyes were hollow.

“It means we have to bury her.”

I blinked. “Bury—”

“Now.”

A murmur rippled through the villagers, hushed and uncertain. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen.

The girl always stood when the ropes were cut. She always smiled. She always walked back with us, untouched and whole.

This was wrong.

I turned to the elders, my voice rising now. “She’s not—” I hesitated, the word catching in my throat. Dead.

Because was she?

Her skin was cold, yes. Too cold. Her breath did not fog in the morning air.

But she was still sitting upright.

Her body wasn’t slack, wasn’t limp.

She was still smiling.

Still watching.

Pastor Callum stepped forward, reaching for her. He placed two fingers beneath her jaw, feeling for a pulse. His own hands shook.

A pause.

A breath.

His shoulders stiffened. His fingers twitched. And then—

He yanked his hand back.

He took two sharp steps away from Lena, his face going white.

I stepped forward, heart hammering. “What? What is it?”

Callum turned to the elders. He did not speak to me. He spoke to them.

“She isn’t hers anymore.”

The eldest of them—Old Martha, who had led the women in braiding Lena’s hair the night before—stepped forward, voice low and firm. “Then we take her now.”

“No.” The word was out before I even realized I’d said it. My pulse slammed against my ribs, fast and panicked. I turned toward the villagers. “We need to think about this.”

Martha’s sharp gaze snapped to me. “No. We don’t.”

She turned, motioning to the men standing stiff in the back of the crowd. “Take her.”

There was hesitation. A long, awful pause.

Then, two of them moved—Ezra and Thomas.

They walked slow, reluctant, as if approaching a wild animal poised to bite. Ezra’s hand hovered above Lena’s shoulder before finally, carefully, grasping her under the arm.

The moment he touched her, his face twisted.

Like something crawled under his skin.

Like he had just stepped barefoot into something rancid and wrong.

Thomas hesitated, but Ezra shot him a look. Together, they lifted her.

Her limbs moved too easily.

Too lightly.

Like she was hollow inside.

A fresh wave of nausea curled in my gut. I took a step forward, but Martha caught my arm.

Her grip was stronger than I expected.

Her fingers dug deep into my sleeve, her nails pressing against my skin.

“This is not your place,” she said.

“The hell it isn’t,” I snapped. I pulled free, breath heavy, something boiling hot under my ribs. “That girl—”

“Is gone.”

The words were final. Absolute.

I turned toward Callum. “She’s my kin.”

The pastor’s face was unreadable, his eyes dark as river silt. “Then do right by her.”

The village moved.

Ezra and Thomas carried what used to be Lena toward the field beyond the clearing. The burial field. The rest of the villagers followed, their voices hushed, their steps slow and heavy.

I stayed behind.

For a long moment, I just stood there.

The wind picked up, rustling through the trees, kicking loose dirt into the morning light.

I turned my head, staring at the Binding Tree.

At the dark, wet places in the bark.

At the way the roots seemed to have shifted.

The wind blew again.

Something creaked, deep and hollow.

Like wood bending.

Like a breath.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry as dust.

And then, from deep within the hollow, something else moved.

Something that should not have.

And in that moment, I understood.

We had buried the wrong thing.

-----------------------------------------------

It started small.

The kind of things you could ignore if you tried hard enough. A missing goat. A dog that wouldn’t stop barking at the woods. Ezra’s wife swore she saw movement among the trees that night—a shape too tall, too still.

But the following day, the goats weren’t just missing.

They were found—stripped clean, nothing left but bones.

I stood at the edge of Ezra’s farm, the smell of raw earth and wet decay thick in the air. The skeletons were picked clean, the ribs standing out like the hollow remains of a burned house. There was no blood. No drag marks.

Like something had simply peeled the flesh away and left the bones behind. 

Ezra stood beside me, jaw clenched tight. “Ain’t no wolf did this.”

I nodded, swallowing down the bile in my throat. He was right.

Wolves didn’t leave bones stacked in a neat little pile, lined up like a damn offering.

I glanced back toward the house. Sarah stood at the porch, arms crossed, watching us. Her face was pale, her eyes dark-rimmed from a night without sleep. I could see how she held her stomach, cradling something invisible, like she could press it all down inside her.

Ezra spat into the dirt, shaking his head. “Something ain’t right.”

He said it low, just for me.

Like he was afraid, the land might hear him.



The rot spread by the end of the week.

The cornfields browned overnight, leaves curling in on themselves like dead fingers. Pumpkins split open in their patches, insides slick and black, writhing with something that smelled too much like meat.

The river turned thick—not muddy, but wrong. The water moved sluggish, heavy, almost solid, like whatever flowed beneath it wasn’t meant to be seen.

We started hearing things, too.

Sarah woke up screaming two nights ago, swearing she heard Lena’s voice outside their window, whispering. She swore she saw her standing by the barn, barefoot in the dirt, smiling.

Smiling.

Always smiling.

I found tracks by the tree line the following day. Tiny, bare feet pressing deep into the mud. They led to the edge of the cornfield—

But never away.



The village tried to pretend.

Tried to act like nothing was wrong. Like the sky wasn’t turning that strange shade of yellow-green like the livestock wasn’t vanishing one by one.

The elders told us to stay inside after dark. They said the land was angry. That we had to give it time.

But time was not helping.

Something was coming.

And we had let it in.



I sat on my porch that night, watching the fields.

The trees swayed slow, their branches moving like ribs shifting under skin. The wind had changed—thicker, heavier, less like air, more like breath.

The house creaked behind me, the wood settling deep.

And then—

Laughter.

Low, quiet, drifting across the fields.

I went still, my hands clenching around the arms of my chair.

It came again.

Soft. Distant.

Familiar.

Lena.

I stood, my heartbeat hammering in my ears. The laughter was close now, just beyond the corn.

And then—

The stalks shuddered.

Not the wind.

Not an animal.

Something else.

Something moving through them.

I grabbed my lantern and stepped off the porch, my boots crunching against the brittle grass. The earth was soft beneath me, sinking slightly with every step.

The laughter had stopped.

I reached the edge of the cornfield. The lantern cast long shadows over the stalks, turning them into twisting things, tall and thin.

I swallowed hard, stepping forward.

Something exhaled.

The sound was deep. Close.

Right behind me.

I turned.

Nothing.

Just the house. The woods beyond. The wind curling through the fields.

But the air was wrong.

Heavy. Rotten.

Like the moment just before a grave caves in.

My stomach twisted. I turned back to the house, moving slow. The boards creaked under my weight as I stepped onto the porch.

And then—

A voice.

Soft. Familiar. Too close.

“Uncle.”

I froze.

My blood turned to ice.

I turned my head just enough to see—

Lena.

Standing by the barn.

Her feet were bare. Her dress white.

Her mouth curved into that same wide, unnatural smile.

But her eyes—

They weren’t hers.

They were deep, dark, and hollow.

And they were looking right at me.

-----------------------------------------------

I didn’t sleep that night.

I sat in my chair, rifle across my lap, eyes fixed on the barn. On the spot where I had seen her—Lena, or what used to be Lena.

The wind howled through the fields, the trees bending in the darkness, but the barn doors never opened. Nothing moved. Nothing came.

By morning, I almost convinced myself I had imagined it.

Until I saw the tracks.

Barefoot. Small.

Leading from the barn to the fields.

But, just like before—

Never away.



I found Pastor Callum by the chapel. He was outside, stacking firewood in tight, even rows, like it was any other day, like the land wasn’t turning black from the inside out.

I watched him for a long moment, my breath heavy, something bitter curling in my gut. He wasn’t afraid.

He knew.

I stepped closer, boots crunching against the frost-covered grass. “You lied to us.”

Callum didn’t look up. He reached for another log, setting it carefully on the pile. “I told you what you needed to know.”

Something sharp cracked in my chest. “She’s out there.” My voice was low, shaking. “Lena. She’s walking around, Callum.”

A pause.

Then, slowly, he nodded.

The weight of that small motion hit me like a hammer to the ribs.

They had known.

I stepped forward, voice rising now. “What did you do?”

Callum finally turned to face me, his lined face unreadable. “It’s not about what we did,” he murmured. “It’s about what we didn’t do.”



We sat inside the chapel, the air thick with the smell of old wax and dried flowers. The windows were small, narrow slits of colored glass, letting in only thin ribbons of light. It felt too dim, too cold.

Callum folded his hands on the table between us, his nails lined with dirt. He had been digging.

I swallowed hard. “Tell me the truth.”

He exhaled slow, his fingers twitching. Then—

“The Binding was never for the land.”

The words stopped me cold.

“What?”

Callum’s mouth tightened, the tendons in his throat shifting as he swallowed. “The stories we tell, about keeping the land tied to the living? Those aren’t lies, exactly. But they aren’t the whole truth either.”

My pulse beat hard behind my ribs. “Then what is?”

Callum glanced toward the door, his gaze distant, like he could already hear something coming.

And then he said it.

“The Binding isn’t to protect us.”

He met my eyes, his face pale, his voice hollow.

“It’s to keep something else out.”



My hands clenched into fists. My breath felt too tight like the walls were pressing in. “So the girls—”

Callum nodded. “They were never meant to survive it.”

My stomach twisted. “But they do.”

His jaw tensed. “They come back.”

A wave of nausea rolled through me. I gripped the edge of the table, my knuckles white. “So they’re not—”

“No.” Callum’s voice was quiet, firm. “They’re not.”

The weight of it settled in my bones, heavy and final.

I had seen the tracks.

I had seen the way the land had begun to rot.

I had seen her.

Lena.

Or what was left of her.

Callum inhaled, slow. “She was supposed to be taken. They all were. But this time…” His voice trailed off, his fingers tightening.

“This time, something went wrong.”

I felt sick. “We buried her.”

Callum didn’t blink. “No. You buried what came back.”



I stood fast, my chair scraping against the wooden floor. “You knew. You knew and you let it happen.”

Callum’s gaze didn’t waver. “It had to happen.”

I wanted to hit him.

Shake him. Scream at him.

But the truth was crawling under my skin, sinking in deep, and I couldn’t ignore it.

Lena had smiled when she was tied to the tree. She had smiled because she knew.

The elders knew.

Everyone knew.

But this time, something had refused the offering.

And now, it was loose.



I staggered outside, the cold air rushing against my face. My breath came hard, and my heart slammed in my chest.

The Binding wasn’t to protect the land.

It was to feed something.

Something that had been here long before us.

And now—

Now, it was hungry.

I turned toward the fields, toward the woods beyond.

The wind shifted, curling through the trees.

And just at the edge of the clearing, standing in the long grass—

Lena.

Smiling.

Waiting.

-----------------------------------------------

By morning, half the village was gone.

Not dead.

Gone.

No blood. No signs of struggle. No broken doors or shattered glass. Just emptiness. Houses left open, still warm from the night before. Bedsheets thrown back, as if someone had risen for the day—but never made it outside.

The streets were quiet. The air hung heavy, thick with something damp, something rotten. The sky was the color of old parchment, pale and bruised with clouds that refused to break.

I walked through the square, boots scraping against the dirt. The market stalls still stood, baskets of fruit untouched. The church doors hung slightly ajar, the inside dark, yawning.

It was too silent.

Even the wind had died.

I stopped before Ezra’s house, my stomach curling tight. Sarah had been pregnant. Eight months along. She had sworn she saw Lena in the fields that night.

I knocked once.

The door creaked inward.

I stepped inside.



The house smelled of woodsmoke and something older, something sour. A fire still smoldered in the hearth, its coals dim, curling faint tendrils of heat into the cold air.

The dining table was set for breakfast—four plates, untouched. A cup had been tipped over, its contents soaked into the tablecloth.

Ezra’s coat still hung by the door. Sarah’s knitting basket sat beneath the window, half-finished baby booties trailing yarn across the floor.

But they were gone.

I swallowed hard, moving deeper inside. My boots echoed too loud against the wooden planks.

Something was wrong.

Something was watching.

I turned toward the bedroom.

The door was open.

The crib sat by the bed, rocking slightly like someone had just stepped away from it.

I moved closer, my breath tight, the air pressing in.

Inside the crib, the blankets were untouched. The sheets smooth.

Sarah had been eight months along.

There should have been something inside.

I took a step back, my chest tightening. My fingers trembled against the rifle slung over my shoulder.

They were gone. All of them.

And the worst part was—

It didn’t feel like they had left.

It felt like they had been taken.



I stumbled back outside, my heart hammering. The village stretched before me, still and empty.

And then I heard it.

The wind.

But it wasn’t moving through the trees.

It was breathing.

Slow. Deep.

Like something stirring just beneath the earth.

The ground felt softer beneath my feet, the soil damp and loose. The houses around me seemed smaller, swallowed by the land as if the roots beneath had begun pulling them down.

I turned, breath shuddering.

From somewhere down the road—a voice.

Soft. Faint. Familiar.

“Uncle.”

I turned my head.

Lena stood by the well, barefoot, her dress too white against the morning fog.

She tilted her head, that same thin, bloodless smile stretching her lips.

And then—

She raised her hand.

She pointed toward the woods.

My pulse stuttered. The trees loomed dark and endless, their branches bending under an unseen weight. The deeper parts of the forest were black, thick with something I couldn’t name.

And in the distance—

I saw movement.

Not people.

Not animals.

Something else.

Something tall.

Something watching.

The wind rose again.

But it wasn’t the wind.

It was the sound of something exhaling.

Something waiting.

-----------------------------------------------

The sun never set.

Not really.

It just… faded.

The sky stretched out in a pale, bruised yellow like an overripe peach left too long in the heat. The light grew thin and sickly, pooling in the spaces between trees like something rotting from the inside out.

The village was empty now.

The doors hung open. The beds were still made. The food still sat on the tables, untouched and turning sour. The people were gone.

Swallowed up.

And I was the last one left.

I stood in the center of the square, the wind curling through the empty streets. The trees creaked in the distance, their branches too heavy, too burdened. The land smelled thick with damp earth, the kind of scent that came after a hard rain—but the ground was dry.

I knew where I had to go.

Lena had told me.

I turned toward the woods, rifle strapped to my back, lantern in my grip. The flame inside it flickered like something was breathing against the glass.

The trees waited.

And I stepped inside.



The forest had changed.

I walked the path I had walked a hundred times before, but it wasn’t the same.

The air felt thicker and dense, pressing against my skin. The roots coiled up from the earth like grasping hands. The trees leaned inward, branches tangling above me, blattering the sky.

There was something else, too.

The sound.

Not footsteps. Not the wind.

A heartbeat.

Low. Slow. Deep.

Not mine.

Something else.

I kept walking, pushing deeper until the path reached the clearing.

The Binding Tree stood before me.

And I wasn’t alone.

Lena was there.

Waiting.

Her bare feet pressed into the soil, her white dress still impossibly clean. The ropes that had bound her the night of the ritual were still there—dangling from the branches like discarded limbs.

She smiled at me.

“You’re late.”



My breath curled in the cold air.

“What is this?” I asked.

Lena tilted her head, watching me like I was something strange, something small. “You already know.”

I swallowed hard, my grip tightening around the lantern handle. The flame inside guttered. I felt the ground shift beneath me—subtle, slow, like something breathing under the dirt.

“Where is everyone?” My voice sounded different here. Hollow. Thin.

Lena’s smile didn’t falter. “They’re where they were always meant to be.”

A slow, cold thing coiled in my chest. “And me?”

Lena blinked and tilted her head the other way.

Then—

She raised her hand.

She pointed toward the tree.

My stomach turned to stone.

The wind pushed through the clearing, sending the ropes swaying, twisting, and groaning against the bark.

And then I saw it.

The shape.

At first, it looked like a knot in the bark, just another twist in the gnarled wood. But then—

It moved.

The outline of a mouth, splitting slowly, cracking open.

A breath. Low and deep.

And I understood.

The tree was not a tree.

It had never been a tree.

Lena stepped forward, her small hands reaching for the ropes.

“It was always supposed to be you.”



The realization hit me like a gunshot.

I stumbled back, my boots sinking into the soft dirt. “No.” My voice was shaking. “That’s not—no.”

Lena just watched.

Like she had known all along.

Like she had just been waiting for me to catch up.

The ropes swayed in the wind, curling down, curling toward me.

Lena’s voice was soft. Almost kind.

“You were always meant to stay.”

I turned.

I ran.



The forest closed in around me.

The branches reached. The roots curled.

The heartbeat grew louder.

I pushed forward, lungs burning, feet slipping against the shifting earth. The trees twisted too tall, too thin, their shapes bending in ways that hurt to look at.

The sky was gone.

Nothing but black.

Nothing but the feeling of something looming overhead, pressing down, exhaling against the back of my neck.

I kept running—

Until I couldn’t.

The ground split open beneath me.

And I fell.



I woke in the clearing.

The ropes were around my wrists.

The bark pressed into my back.

The sky was gold and churning.

Lena stood before me, her small hands folded neatly in front of her dress.

She smiled.

“It’s better this way.”



The village still stands.

But it is different now.

The fields have turned green again. The river runs clear.

And in the center of the clearing, beneath the great, gnarled tree, the people gather once more.

A new girl is chosen.

She kneels in the grass, hands folded, waiting for the ropes.

And behind her, the tree stands still.

Waiting.

Watching.

Breathing.



The Binding holds.
