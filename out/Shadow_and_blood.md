I can still remember the dark, sultry eye that crept out from a slim hood on the train. The fabric seemed thin. It wasn't a cold night, but the wind warranted more than the sheer cloak and stockings this girl was wearing. 

The train stops and reality sets in. She was not looking at me, I was looking at her. I look down at my partially removed cover-alls and muddy boots. She was definitely not looking at me. There is rock, clay, and grease covering every inch of me and I think this girl would even give me the time of day. Fuck. Next stop, desperation. 

Home isn't much. It's a one-bedroom apartment with a TV and a bed. I used to play video games with the guys and now they are all too busy. They have wives, kids, minivans, HOA's. I don't mind it. Being alone means I am not responsible for anyone or anything. There is a certain amount of freedom that comes with loneliness. That's how Frank died.

Frank was a goldfish my therapist recommended as a treatment for social anxiety. I wouldn't say i loved the fish but i had him for almost 8 months. I remember his tail would wiggle a little more quickly when i got home. It made me happy, even though i knew his excitement stemmed from being fed. We all show our excitement in a similar fashion to keep the world turning. I'm not better than Frank, in some ways I envy him. Frank's exuberance was met with his need being fulfilled and a cute little chat that he didn't understand at all. 

Sometimes I stare at the empty bowl and i feel like shit. He wasnt going to live forever but I could have given him a better life. A bigger tank, one of those bubble things, a fucking girlfriend?
Frank didn't live his life, he just existed. And then, he didn't. I didn't even clean his bowl when he died. I flushed him and placed his home on the counter like it was a dish full of leftovers that would rot in the sink for a week.

Frank deserved better.
I have to be better.
I need better.

As I fall asleep my mind turns to the girl on the train. In my mind i catch a glimpse of her hair and it has a purple streak. She pushes it behind her ears coyly as she steps off the train....

I wake up so hard it hurts. Glancing over at the clock its 6:44. I know I'm going to be late but I can make it close.
Fuck. Run. Run.
I'm buckling and strapping as I approach the station. I can smell the stench coming off of my gear and I feel shame when people pull away from me. 

(Get your shit together)
[I'm trying]
(Not very hard, you're complacent) 
[You're imaginary, shut up] 

I often have these conversations with myself on the train. Never out loud, but that would go unnoticed either way.

"Next stop Washington Ave & 33rd"

I'm still two blocks from work. I'm gonna be late and I'm gonna catch hell for it. In my mind it's always the voice on the train to blame. She knew i was gonna be late so she screwed me over. Yeah. 
I really need the work and I don't mind it. On the other hand, when my site manager gets in my face it's comparable to shaving with a cheese grater. He threatens me, I remind him that I am the best he has. That's it.  Every day. 

Our current site is a bit nasty. I'm working on the bowels of our structure cutting rebar 11 hours a day. (Its not that bad, against OSHA regulations our foreman lets have headphones). Against my better judgment, I was having a good day. I even got a nod of approval from my boss, professor dickhead. Still, at the back of my mind, behind the cacophony of tools, the smoke and dirt in the air; she was there.

Shadow-halved and smirking. She smelled like lavender and books bound by leather. Her eyes glinted with a secret she would never share. The wind gusts and I feel her porcelain skin across my cheek.

I open my eyes. I have miscut a piece of steel, BADLY. I look around to make sure no one is hurt and I am greeted by bug eyes and white faces. No one is hurt. No one, but me.

In my girly daydream i managed to skip off the steel and go directly between my thumb and index finger. Blood was everywhere, all over my hand, my clothes,  my buddy Tommy's face. These cut at around 9000 rpms. It shredded me. But i cant lose this job. I'm already on thin ice.

I tear off a bit of my t-shirt and tape it around my hand. The startled crew around me pleads me to seek medical help. 

"I'll go to the hospital, you guys keep workin."

I explain the incident the site manager and get begrudgingly waved off site. I hop on a train towards downtown and pass the fuck out.





Cold. Dark. Wet?

I awake knowing i am not in a hospital,  not in my home, not at work. Panic sets in. Have I been kidnapped? Did they harvest my organs? Am i being trafficked? 

"Relax, you are safe"

"WHERE AM I?" 

I heard the frightened, almost boyish tone in my voice and decided i should try a more Alpha approach. 

"I need to know where I am, now."
I felt very good about this. 

"Take it easy, Batman. I did you a favor."

The voice burned inside my head but i felt the rest of my body pulling away from me like moth to a flame. 

"What did you do to me? "

A flat, deep silence fell across the room i still can't see. 

"You're still you. I just stitched you up."

I push of the edge of the enclosure and feel a stitch pop in my left hand. The pain shoots through the hand, then the wrist, all the way to the shoulder. 

A hand pushes forcefully into my chest, plunging me into what i hope is ice and water. The cold became more intense when it was new and not a choice. I fade away again. 

"STOP. DOING. THAT."

The harsh tone wakes me and this time i comply. I look at my hand and see that it is now bandaged and in a cast. 

"Did... did you take me to the hospital?"

A high pitched squeal erupted from my captor. Squinting, i turn to see bright green beautiful eyes, glowing back at me. 

"I've been following you all week waiting for you to talk to me. I didn't think you would resort to the 'I'm gonna cut my hand off' routine but you do you."

"Routine?! I could have died and you have me cooped up in some Saw movie bathroom! For what?  What do you want?!"

"A date."

"A date?  Really?  My life over a date?"

"I think referring to it as a transaction is quite rude but if that's how you prefer it then YES."

She stepped forward so quickly and quietly I almost fell back into the tub or trough situation behind me. It was her. The girl from the train. The girl from my dream. The girl that made me almost cut my hand off. The girl who saved me. 

"I.. i was gonna.. i wanted to.."

"No, you weren't."

Her words were as cold and cutting as they were true.  I would have never had the guts to talk to her. Ever. She was so perfect. Alpha voice didn't work,  let's try Beta.

"Ahem.. Would you like to join me for dinner and a movie?"

She scoffed "We don't eat the same things and I've seen every movie."

Feeling defeated,  I think of my parents first date to the drive in. The troubled romanticism can surely keep her around. She really liked anything from their generation, it seemed. 

"Wanna grab a case and watch the sun come up?"
The words poured out of me like vomit. To my surprise,  she seemed delighted. 

"I thought you'd never ask."









We sat on the hill on an old knit blanket my grandmother had made for me until the dew had soaked completely through. I told her stories of my older brother and the trouble we got into. She never let me stop talking. I went on about learning to bake with my mom,  fishing trips with my dad; every story brought her a little closer to me. It was only when I finished telling my family stories that i realized she had none. 

The hills to the east began to turn grey. We were almost asleep. We didn't make love but it had been the most erotic night of my life. She closed her eyes with her arm around my waist and her ear to my chest. 

Then she began to weep. And age. 

"Don't forget me."
She whispered,  almost as a prayer. 

The quirky, beautiful young woman became older and thinner by the second. The weight of her body lifted from my arms and as the sun crested the hills I was left with nothing but silver ash. It cascaded across my arms and into the stitches of my grandmother's blanket. And she was gone. 

I loved her. 

I sat for a long time on the hill top. I thought of how much she had taught me in such a short time. I wish she had met Frank. I wish i knew her name. 
Fuck.

I cried for a while. Couldn't go to work anyway. When it was time to go home i had a nice stretch and started walking. I felt at peace. I started whistling one of the Irish folk tunes she had playing in her "dungeon" and as I swung my hands i noticed the intricacy of my stitches. 

It was her name and a cute little heart. I could never forget her.  But she wanted to be sure of it.
