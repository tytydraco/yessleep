I sat at my desk in my sterile office space, nondescript and uniform, just like the Government likes it. It was a late night, and I had to cancel plans with my partner to go out to the local watering hole to ring in the New Year. As I was in the process of letting Jerome down, killing any chance of him talking to me again within the next week, my work phone started ringing.

  
Putting all of my thoughts on hold to send Jerome, I pulled myself together by slamming my glass of whiskey and answering, “this is Mathias.” My second in command, Anna, chirped into the phone, “Mr. Kinney, we have an issue in Lab D7, I am not really sure how to tell you this…”

  
“Look, Anna, it is 45 minutes to midnight on the New Year, what could possibly be happening that you can’t handle?” I cut her off in my moderate frustration having to be here to supervise this extremely classified and expensive experiment. Suddenly, through my annoyance, I realized the D Level labs were for more theoretical experiments and they should not be in use at this time. Before Anna could respond, I continued by asking, “what exactly do you mean by D7? I was not aware anything would be occurring in that lab until February.”  


“Well, sir, that’s part of the problem. We weren’t supposed to be in the lab, one of our new contracted hires went to use the restroom, and ended up in there. They are yelling some very strange things and have locked themselves inside.” Anna sounded very nervous, somehow keeping herself held together. I could hear a lot of commotion and shouting going on in the background of the phone line.  


I sigh, “alright, I will be right there, keep an eye on them and make sure they don’t do anything rash.” I directed her as I straightened my tie, poured another shot of whiskey and downed that also. Happy New Year to me! I quickly shoot Jerome a text as I am opening the door to my office to navigate down the hall towards the elevator, “Hey babe, sorry, crisis at work, won’t be able to meet you at The Wave. Love you, txt you ASAP.”  


By the time I reach the elevator, my phone pings with a response, “Yeah, sure.” Oh I know he is upset and going to give me an earful, but this is a very nice paying position. The elevator dings, and the door opens, I go inside and hit the button for Level D. As I am taken down into the subterranean floors of this compound, I recollect that the last time that I missed a major holiday with Jerome was New Years in 2008. At that time I was still in the armed forces, in Intel trying to run operations in the Middle East. I made sure after that to be sure that I am able to be sent home for the holidays until I got sent home from my deployment.  


After coming home, I got a job in a government lab. I will not divulge which one under my NDA, and this job pays way too well to fuck up. I just happened to be the one to draw the little straw to be on site for this weekend. Jerome will live, I just make a mental note to take him out to his favorite restaurant, Rooster & Owl, for a nice romantic night out next weekend. The elevator dings and brings me back to reality, the doors slide open and the halls lined with lab rooms looks particularly unsettling. Fluorescent lights flickering off and on, three quarters of them not even on at all. I step out and glance side to side to see if I can spot Anna.  


I take a few steps to my right, away from D7, which is to the left, when suddenly my nerves jerk me into next week as a hand is placed on my shoulder. I hear Anna’s voice, “Mr. Kinney, this isn’t looking really good, I know, turns out the breaker box for the floor is in D7 and Smithers decided to short circuit half of the floor.” She is referring to new recruit Andrew Smithers, a quiet 20 something fresh out of Yale really wanting to make a name for himself in the science world. I interviewed him, personally. He was a bit strange, yeah, but really exhibited high intelligence. “What can you tell me, Anna?” I asked with authority. Even in a sense of crisis, my time in the military taught me how to keep my head on tight.  


“Up in B3, there was an accident,” Anna started.  


“B3 is where you’re experimenting with mapping the subject, yes?” I asked for clarity.  


“Yes,” she confirmed, “as you know the big meat and potatoes of this contract is to map the parallel universe that was discovered. Our drone that we have sent through the portal to the other side suddenly lost connection for a total of 2 minutes and 17 seconds. Some of us figured maybe it got out of range and we could not be able to recover it. However, it came back online, but things looked off. Nothing appeared to be in focus, and appeared to be shifting in waves.”  


“Okay, so were you able to troubleshoot to ensure that everything was online properly? The head of the program would have MY head if any of the data is corrupted,” I took a cloth handkerchief from my pocket and wiped the sweat from my forehead.  


“We ran all preliminary tests and all of the metrics on the drone came back perfect. There is nothing wrong with the drone. It was at this point that one of the other contractors noticed Smithers lost in a daze staring into his monitor. When Harris went over to check out Smithers, it was reported that Smithers was watching the drone footage from the other day, December 29th. The footage looked to be distorted, though, as Harris reported. There was a lot of static feedback on the film as well.” Anna continued with her update.  


“How did he gain access to the archive to view this? It is all encrypted and hidden, more secure than Fort Knox. No one but the Director should be able to access it.” I inquired.  


Anna frowned, her brow raising, “that is something we are not sure about. See, Smithers was unresponsive at this point. He acted comatose. He would only stare forward with a dead look in his eyes. It wasn’t until about 20 minutes after I turned his computer off that he actually responded in any way. He claimed he urgently needed to use the restroom, so I had Harris help him just in case Smithers lost consciousness, or went comatose again.”  


She continued, “After 10 minutes had passed and they did not return, I left the lab and went to find them just to make sure that everything was alright. I approached the Men’s room and knocked. An very distinct smell of iron filled my nostrils, and since I didn’t get any response, I barged in. I can’t honestly believe so much blood came from one person. Needless to say, theres going to be a lot of paperwork because Harris has been.. For lack of better words.. Terminated.” She hands me a bloodied workplace badge that belonged to Harris. May he rest.  


“What the fuck…?” I half asked, holding the work badge in my hand. I raised my eyes and met the gaze of Anna. “Let’s go, this is a dangerous situation and I don’t need anyone else getting hurt, or worse, on my watch.”  


As we both started walking down the hall towards D7, Anna continued reporting to me, “so we obviously have alarms for the D level labs, due to their sensitive nature. As I was looking around for Smithers, the system went off alerting me that someone was down here. I discovered him in D7, locked in and the control panel to unlock the lab busted. He has been shouting nonsense since I have found him. Our security team, as you can see, are still hard at work trying to find a way to bypass the system and get in.”  


We stopped in front of the glass sliding door to access D7, Smithers was standing right in front of it, staring out. His stare was dead, devoid of any soul. His pupils were as large as the iris of his eyes. His breathing was shallow and he looked like he hadn’t slept in weeks. Extremely pale with deep, dark bags under his eyes. “The time is now.” He starts cackling, “They see me, they see you, they see everyone but us.” Smithers’ voice starts to crack out from the intercom.  


“What do you mean, son? Who are they?” I ask, trying to take control of the conversation.  
“They who exist beyond what we know exists. You’ve seen them in your dreams, they’ve watched you in real life.” Smithers states, repeating the same sentences over again.  


“Okay Smithers, I need you to open this door so that you can show me what you mean.” I try to switch things up and see if I can get him to open the door.  


“No,.... No No No… That will not do, not until our guests have arrived.” Smithers starts to slowly back away from the door. There, positioned in the lab, moved to the center of the room, is the XJ-9980. This is a piece of machinery that was developed for the sole purpose of ripping a hole in the fabric of reality, to allow us access into the parallel universe, named Celestial v.2. Smithers screams out, “shut up! SHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!” He laughs, quietly at first and the intensity builds to that of a madman, “they’re SO EXCITED to meet you!”  


He inches ever closer to the XJ-9980 machine. I put my hand up, trying to get his attention and call out, “let’s not do anything we’re going to regret, Smithers! You don’t know how that machine operates, you could get injured, or worse!”  


His eyes roll into the back of his head, and he screams an utterly ear piercing shriek, “THEY’RE IN MY HEAD! MAKE IT STOP! IT HUUUUUURTS!!!” He grabs his head and starts to squeeze it, trying to relieve himself of some of the agony he is going through. As if controlled by an outside source, the control panel on the XJ-9980 lights up, the draw of power of this machine alone kills power to everything else on this floor. Shrouded in pure darkness, the only light that can be seen is the display panel flickering with a series of alphanumerics.  


“SMITHERS!” I call out, however, only in vain.  


A set of safety lights gently illuminate the portal machine and its surroundings, the letters and numbers still scrolling across the display screen. The next thing that I realize is seeing the silhouette of a hand smashing down on the “Activate” button. The titanium platform positioned to the left of the machine starts to glow a very haunting green. Flowing around like a whirlpool, in circles, the center becomes darker until it reaches the depth of the blackest black. A howling wind is heard that continues to become louder by the second. I can see Smithers still shouting, but it is so loud that it only looks like he is lipsyncing, no words to be heard.  


The last thing that I remember, before passing out, was a long arm reaching out of the portal, a hand big enough to wrap around Smithers’ entire waist, and pulled him in. The sickening part about it, was even though it was just a circle of light, it was as if he was pulled into a solid object. The angle that his body was to fit through the hole caused him to break in half at the pelvis.  


—--  


I dreamed that every nightmare, every imaginable horror, came through that portal from Celestial v.2. I awoke in the compound infirmary, dazed and confused. I tried to jump up. “What happened!? Where's Smithers? Anna??” A nurse quickly wrangled me under control, saying that I am safe, and that the Director will have to fill me in. Nurse Mary brought me some broth and ginger ale, and I put that down quickly, feeling like I haven’t ate or drank in almost a week.  


About 2 hours later, Director Barnes walked in the door, straight to business he shook my hand, “Kinney, we’re in some deep shit.”  


I look at him, my eyes asking, “what do you mean?”  


Reading my expression, “Smithers is missing, Harris is missing, Anna is missing. We have three missing personnel, and that’s just the easy problem. Smithers, upon opening the portal to Celestial v.2, has unleashed Hell on Earth, to be poetic. I am going to deal with the missing individuals, however, I have a new item to add to your job description. We need, as the government, to keep these monsters hush hush. So your new responsibility is going to be to go out there and hunt them down. Capture them. Contain them. Send them back to where they came from.”  


I laughed out loud, thinking this was a joke. Upon realizing that Director Barnes was being very serious, I simply asked, “How?”  


With a large grin on his face, he said, “When you’re ready to discharge from here in a couple of hours, come and see me in my office. Welcome to Project 13.” He turned around and left me, a little confused, a lot of nerves, but ready for some excitement.  


I pulled out my phone and texted Jerome, “You’re never going to believe this.”
