The eyes inside the trees. 


Back in the Adirondack’s there was an occurrence which made me conscious of the danger I’d find in Appalachia. Long ago there was a time when my curiosity was unbridled due to my time in the forests. So when the neighbors plants began to grow into my yard I began to care for and harvest them. This did however, result in me reaching through the hole in the massive wooden barrier to gather more. Through ancestral guidance I had been putting them into a mortar and pestle I had taken from the kitchen, grinding them up and making ‘perfume’. One day upon retracting my small hand back across the fence I was greeting with a peering eye. This frightened me however my scream was returned with a curious laugh. An older woman was laughing at me before walking over to the lower fence which was made of chain. 


“Little girl, why have you been taking my plants?” She asked curiously, no hint of malice in her words. 


Timidly I explained,”I didn’t mean to. They were growing over on my side of the fence and I need them to make perfume.”


The woman looked skeptical but laughed and asked me to show her. I ran to my hiding place behind the garage and she followed along the fence. I brought out the mortar and pestle and brought it to her, showing her the wonderful lambs ear and mint paste I had made. She seemed impressed in my mind but upon reflection it was more the expression of a mother admiring their child’s first messy finger paint. She gave me a gentle scolding on why I shouldn’t do this and should only harvest on my side but also told me where in the woods to find these same plants. She explained their names and uses and why they smelled good. She also left me with a most exceptional treasure. ‘The eyes in the woods’. She told me the tales, and she warned me not to stare or have wondering eyes for if you do things will be able to look back at you. Animals of all kinds have wonderful camouflage so often times you may end up staring at something you hadn’t intended to. Something I affectionately called out as ‘the eyes’ of the woods.  She told me many other warnings such as never to pick up strange objects, do not follow strange paths, do not enter yards but most importantly to beware of silence. She explained that my animal companions make perfect harbingers of danger so to always heed them. 


She was a beautiful olive tanned women, hazel eyes and thin frame with long silver and black hair that hung down nearly to her knees. She was gentle and kind. 


But she didn’t exist. 


My family has no recollection of them, only of a young family from Ghana who lived on the property. With the description of the woman bearing striking resemblance to my Abuela’s Great Grandmother who came from Spain and was proficient in herbal knowledge.
