As the title says, I have been having trouble sleeping. I was hoping you guys could help. It all started about two weeks ago, which was when I brought home my new girlfriend. She’s incredibly nice, but it’s been really weird. Ever since she moved in, the house has been restless. I’ve been feeding it the recommended house diet my mom gave me, but it seems to be hungry.  
  
As for my girlfriend, she’s everything I’ve ever hoped for. Nice, blonde hair, brown eyes, just relaxed in general. She also recently dyed her nails into this nice shade of red.  
  
Just wanted to give you guys the gist of it. Normal house, well-fed house, usually happy house. Let me begin with the first instance of the house acting weird.  
  
I was feeding the house some steak, seasoned with basil, which is what my mom recommended. But then, my girlfriend came in, and the houses mouth instantly closed and vanished. She asked me what I was doing. I told her I was feeding the house, and she gave me a weird look and walked away.  
  
I went to bed that night, and the house was creaking more than usual. I thought it was hungry, but I couldn’t find the mouth anywhere, so I assumed that wasn’t the case. I’m sure if you guys have a house, you’ll know this, but for those of you who don’t, I’ll give you the general instructions.  
  
You have to feed the house with some specific herbs to keep it happy and healthy. If you don’t feed it, it starts whining, and eventually consumes some furniture, or meat if it can find it. But my house is special. I know that because I overheard my parents talking about the house, and how it was “Special.” I asked mom about it, and she said the house was lactose intolerant. I looked up some good foods for a house once I got my own, but for some reason google didn’t have any results.  
  
You also have to let the house get used to you, which essentially involves cutting some skin off and feeding the house that. According to my parents, that’s why some people don’t own houses.   
  
Anyway, back to the problem at hand. The house has been creaking a LOT  since my girlfriend arrived. It also only accepts food when she isn’t home, and seems to be dead whenever she is. I don’t really get why, but it’s been making me borderline unable to sleep. If I had to guess, I’d say I’ve had about an hour of sleep per night.  
  
This has happened before, but it wasn’t this severe. It was on my 18th birthday. The house started making tons of signs that it was unhappy. The only time it was happy was when it was just me in the house. Eventually, my parents moved out, but for some reason they haven’t answered any calls or texts I send them.   
  
I honestly am starting to loathe my girlfriend. The house has treated me well usually, and so does she, but the house doesn’t like her for some reason. I think the house might be trying to tell me something. Some other incredibly strange things have been happening.  
  
Usually, the house sprouts eyes and watches me while I sleep. Originally, I found it creepy, but now it seems oddly peaceful. But I haven’t seen any eyes or anything. I only ever see the mouth once a week or so, compared to its usual feeding schedule of once every 2 days.  
  
I’ve also been having my memory and focus improve. I always got a C average in school, but since she arrived, I’ve been able to actually THINK. I have no clue why, maybe it’s because I’m having someone near me?   
  
She’s also extremely scared of spiders. She saw a tiny little house spider, only about the size of  a tissue box, and started screaming in fear. Why is she so scared? It’s super tiny compared to other spiders! She also sometimes leaves meat around, which is bad. I don’t want the house to be overfed. I’m typing this while she’s gone, so she doesn’t see this.  
  
Anyway, back to the subject at hand. My sleep deprivation, I think it was. What little sleep I get, I dream. I dream about walking into the basement, which is always locked, and walking to a chair there. I sit down, and see a dinner table. Then I’m eating dinner with my parents. It’s always the exact same dream, every single time.   
  
My girlfriend had been complaining about a feeling of being watched. I’m pretty sure she owned a house, so why doesn’t she know that’s normal? I mean, sure, she reacted negatively to the house spider, but maybe where she’s from house spiders are smaller.  
  
The reason I’m posting today, instead of last week, or the day before, is because of a dream I had last night.  
  
As usual, I got up out of bed. But this time, my girlfriend wasn’t in bed. This time, I went to the basement, and saw someone occupying the usual chair. I grabbed them, and heard a chewing sound. I started choking, and coughed up a ball of blonde hair. I felt the urge to hold their hand, so I did. The things hand was wet, and red from what I saw. I gripped the hand harder, and a finger popped off. I picked it up to put it back on the hand, and was shocked by it. Every part of the finger was red and wet. The only part that wasn’t wet were the nails, which were a beautiful shade of red.   
  
I placed the finger back onto the thing, then grabbed something from its head. I only saw it for a few seconds, but it looked like a brown eye. The eye vanished from my hand, and I felt rejuvenated. I walked back to my bed, noticing the considerable lack of girlfriend, and went to sleep, no creaks at all.  
  
 I woke up and saw my girlfriend wasn’t there. It was a few hours after she usually came back from work. I couldn’t believe I slept that long. I got up to get a glass of water and brush my teeth, and grimaced at my reflection. I must have had a really bad bloody nose.  
  
Anyway, my house is back to normal. I still hear creaking, but it’s sounding less like creaking and more like screaming. It’s still incredibly hard to go to sleep, so I was hoping you guys had some advice for me. If any of you own a house, please send advice about that too.
