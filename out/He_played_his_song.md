I went to see him in concert. I was 26 years old. I waited in line for 6 hours. I was offered drugs in line but said no because I didn't want to get scared.

But then he played his song.

When the gates opened, I ran to the stage like a dog chasing a motorcycle. I wanted to be as close to him as possible. I never noticed the mole he had just above his right bicep. 

But then he played his song.

We all went to see Blue Michael perform. That was the one thing we all had in common. But what did we have now? Now that he played his song.

He had flood lights behind him. The shape of him (his silhouette) was burned into our retinas. It was as if he was the center of the universe, a dying star, pulling us all towards him. He was beautiful.

But...

Then he played his song.

It's like they were animals. Upon his first utterance every single person did an about-face. They spunt like they exploded backwards. It was like the flood gates of Blue Michael opened and they all wanted to stay dry. They were startled, and then scared, and then beyond hungry. When his music played, they were hungry for nothing. They ran on all fours like small creatures of the night.

I thought I heard this one before, but I had liked it then. I had it on CD. It was a nice indie rock song that even my mom didn't mind me playing during the power outage. The only one ever for us. It was a big event for me because I was so scared of the quiet. This was of course, before he played his song.

I was in the front row, and I saw when they ran opposite BM. The concert hall was over the water, but they were impartial to the walls. They screamed whether or not they hit a wall, and not one had the mind to go around them. Even worse, no two people ever made the same combination of noises and it made it that much easier to hear Blue Michael's song. I think everyone could hear his song.

It was like a reverse concert. If a concert was in reverse, it would be like 25000 people at the Budweiser Center trying to yell at four regular people. They would be fucking scared.

They piled up on the walls like the zombies from World War Z and leaked out of the stadium into the ocean. The Budweiser Bradleys lining the parapet's were swamped into the ocean. Their iconic cheers indiscriminate from the horrible screams. Were they afraid of Blue Michael or just his aboding choir spreading his message? They formed a pyramind on the surface of the bay and humanity was their tomb. One giant mosh pit.

And this would be how it was now. If he never stopped playing his song.

And who would stop him?
