Hello reddit, coming here because I really need a second opinion on this. If anyone has the free time to read this, some input would be very helpful. This is not by any means what I would call a “normal” occurrence or problem. But I’m hoping someone has some idea of a natural phenomenon that can explain what’s been happening or can think of something I can do.

Some background, my house is old and doesn’t have central air so we use window air conditioners. There is one in each bedroom and then one in my parents office. I’ve never really liked the sound an air conditioner makes and on top of that I have always struggled with insomnia. So in the summer I put the AC timer on so that the air conditioner turns on 3 or 4 hours after I get into bed. This way I don’t have to hear it while falling asleep but while I sleep my room still cools down so I’m not waking up in the middle of the night hot and uncomfortable (I assume you all can relate). Obviously if it’s too hot I just suffer but since it is finally getting cooler I can regularly get away putting on the timer or not sleeping with it on at all. I was actually planning on taking my AC out this past week but then strange stuff started happening and I don’t know if I want to/can now.

So, about a week ago (last Saturday) I was lying awake in bed intermittently doing the whole “I’m gonna roll around for 15 minutes till I finally get comfortable” shimmy when I heard a loud thump on my air conditioner. It sounded like something had fallen onto it. Initially it scared the fuck out of me. It wasn’t something hard because it didn’t make that loud clanging noise, it sounded like flesh. You know that soft thump that animals make when they land on something, it was a bit like that. At first I thought it was some animal or possibly [exploding head syndrome](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21907-exploding-head-syndrome-ehs) until I heard the way it breathed. I could hear through the air conditioner this breathing. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I have those stickers on my windows that make them really frosted (because I got nosy neighbors) and a blind, so I couldn’t see what was there. But there was something. I laid in my bed legitimately frozen in fear (didn’t know it was a real thing till now) for what had to have been 3 hours, just listening. The breathing was unlike anything you’d expect from an animal let alone a human. It was this intentional rhythm that sounded forced as if whatever was out there wasn’t capable of automatic breathing. The inhale was sharp and slow like it was smelling. And the exhale felt almost voyeuristic to listen to. The out breath was this soft almost pleasured release of breath, like whatever was on the other side of my window was smiling. And every long slow breath was the same, smelling and smiling and moist and controlled. After a while I fell asleep just from pure exhaustion at being hyper alert for so long.

That next morning I woke up late and had to rush to get to school so I partially forgot about all of it. It seemed like a dream anyhow so it wasn’t hard to push it away (on top of it being genuinely traumatizing that first time). But then it happened again Monday night. That same thud onto the AC and the breathing, the same unnatural breathing, like I was listening to a looped recording . Except the second night there was something that was a bit different. I assume it was there the first night and I was just too shocked to process it. But the smell of the thing. Wet dog and gasoline is the only way to describe it. I could smell the stench filling up my room. It was always gone by morning but having to fall asleep with that smell is like nothing I could describe. I’ve started putting Vicks under my nose before I go to bed. It helps a bit but the scent is so penetrating. (So if anyone has any suggestions about that, PLEASE!) And it’s been the same every night since, including last night. So I know that I’m not imagining all of this, even if it can be explained away, there definitely is something happening. Something or someone is out there every night breathing outside. And  it’s not that it just sounds real but it feels real. And not in a “gut instinct” kind of way but like I can feel a presence on the other side of the window. I can FEEL whatever is staring at me despite the blind and the stickers. Like imagine you’re on the subway and you feel someone staring only to turn around and see someone's eyes glued to you, It’s that feeling right before you turn around, when you just know.. It feels like that but more assaulting almost like if I was naked.

And before anyone says anything about this, yes I have considered sleeping down stairs or taking out my AC or even going to a friend's house. But I am worried. 

When I am in my room with the AC on I know what it will do (if it really is even there and I’m not losing my mind). It will come to perch on my AC and it will breathe till I can finally fall asleep. I don’t know what it will do if I decide to sleep somewhere else. What if I go downstairs and sleep on my living room couch and it’s there outside my window. And I can see it. I could just not look, but I know I would, and then it would be real. And if I go to a friend’s, will it know I left? Will it follow me? 

The thing I am most afraid of is taking out the air conditioner. It is the only barrier between me and it. I’ll say again that my house is old, so unfortunately the lock on my window is shit and can come undone really easily (example: when my old boyfriend thought it would be cute to climb up the side of my house and break into room, the window was locked but he just pushed it and it opened // very terrifying, not cute Kevin). You push it from the outside, or even inside and it comes open. I guess I could get a new lock but how would I explain that to my parents? Besides my nosy neighbors, my neighborhood is criminally safe. So how would I explain wanting a lock, my parents barely lock the front door as it is (yes I have started checking that it and all of the windows in the house are locked at night don’t worry). And either way I don’t know if a lock would stop it anyhow, maybe it already comes inside. I just really don’t know what to do. And I don’t know what to think. 

And even more, since last Tuesday my mom has been asking me NEARLY EVERY DAY to take out my AC. I said (before all this happened) that I would take it out sometime this week and now I can’t. She gets cold easily and has control issues so I’m worried she’s going to end up taking it out herself while I’m at school. 

With that said, please, does anyone have any idea what’s going on? Any suggestions on what to do? Because I can’t keep living like this.
