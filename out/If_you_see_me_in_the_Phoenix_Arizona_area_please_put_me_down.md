Hello. I'm Alex Miller, and, as the title implies, if you see me, please put me down. Every night, ever since I went down to Louisiana and got my fortune told, I've turned into… Something, every night.

In the woman's exact words, (I think, the sleep deprivation is starting to take its toll), she said, “Oh no, child. Something will take over your body at night, be warned. Keep your distance from others, for their safety.”

Of course, I just laughed it off and went on with the rest of the trip with my friends. I wasn't laughing so much, however, once I woke up the next morning, covered in blood, gore and chunks of bone, and my friends were gone.

I didn't have any idea what happened for the first few nights, I just knew I had to get far away. Honestly, with how long I've had to deprive myself of sleep to keep that thing at bay, I don't even know how long ago that first night was. Could've been 2 weeks, could've been 2 years.

I'm here to tell you all of what I've done, or what I may have done, for the past 2 weeks.

About 2 weeks ago, I was slowly shambling up the stairs of a motel, praying I could lock myself into my room for the night before I fell asleep to at least give everyone else some form of safety.

I hadn't slept in 8 days, and I could feel sleep's gentle, terrifying call lulling me. With shaky hands, dropping the key multiple times, I opened the door, slipping inside, barely able to lock the door and bolt the chain before falling to my knees. I could feel the crack of my bones extending in my arms and fingers, the tearing of the flesh covering my shoulder blades as wings slowly extended from the holes in my flesh.

I fell to the floor, my eyes slipping closed as sleep took me under, my last thought being the hope that the door lock and chain would be enough. If you're gonna ask what I see when I transform, it's nothing. It's just like you or anyone else falling asleep. I close my eyes, a few seconds of darkness, then I wake up, covered in people's different body parts and viscera.

I awoke the next morning, covered in blood, a piece of a person's scalp sticking from my teeth, blood covering my body, bits of bone stuck to my clothes. I felt something hard, wet in my mouth, as I got up, walking to the toilet and spitting out someone's finger bone.

I sighed, flushing the bone, before walking back to the bed to watch the news and hear what I had done. The moment I turned on the TV, I saw a police sketch of what I'd turned into. No nose, no hair, beady, pale blue eyes, pointy ears, completely white skin, large teeth sticking from my jaws, sunken in cheeks. I’d killed 2 people who were completely unidentifiable from what I'd done, a man, three prostitutes, and… Two children.

I got up, running to the toilet to vomit. It's happened before, that thing killing children in my body, but every time I see it happen, it doesn't stop me from vomiting.

If you're gonna ask why I don't just do the job myself, it's because this thing has whispered in my ear that I can't die by my own hand, that I'd need someone else to do it with some form of golden blade or bullet.

Around 5 days ago, I fell asleep, waking up with the smell of iron filling the room of the abandoned house I had fallen asleep in, feeling a particularly large shard of bone poking me in my side. I pulled out my phone, checking the local news.

An old woman who had been unfortunate enough to be taking a smoke as I passed through, 2 men who were on their way home from a party together, and an unidentifiable splatter of blood covering the side of a convenience store.

I sighed, before hearing a voice. “Do it again tonight… It was fun…” I paused. That never happened, besides from the first three nights… It spoke to me. That fucking thing spoke to me, and it wasn't even near night time.

Today, I was at the grocery store, grabbing supplies, like a bunch of coffee to keep myself up as long as possible, barely enough food to last for around a month, and a case of water. Then, I heard it. “Do it… Stab the mother and her baby next to you…”

I felt my hand twitching towards the pocket my pocket knife was in. I was able to stop myself, quickly leaving the store after paying for my items. That thing was starting to gain control during the day. It was starting to gain control during the day and I couldn't stop it.

Please, before I'm stuck being controlled by this thing forever, put me down. I'm currently in the Phoenix Arizona area. I'm a 5’3, skinny woman with long blonde hair and blue eyes, and please, for the love of God, before this thing takes control forever, put me down. Put a golden bullet between my eyes, stab me in the throat with a golden knife, beat me over the head with a gold encrusted dildo for all I care.

 Just please, for the love of God.

Put.
Me.
Down.
