I don’t think regular human beings are prepared to come face to face with what was, what is, and what is to come, all in the same teary eyed, naive, thoughtless gaze. It’s too much for our small minds to handle, I think. I’ve experienced that once or twice in this lifetime. Taking a Michigander and shipping him off to a foreign land where nobody knows anything about you except your last name and rank can be overwhelming to say the least. It may be nihilistic of me to think so, but listening to the sounds of artillery rip your friends to shreds, hearing them call for God, their mother, or any other variety of final requests they may make, knowing their demise is nearing with every second, puts the value of individual lives in perspective.  
  
By the time the black suits and billionaires decided the fighting was done and I was sent home, I had nothing but a small satchel of personal effects, used battle rags, and nightmares, I had forgotten what it was like not to sleep on four hour intervals trading time with a fearful, wide eyed kid from the Bronx, or a too-cool-for-school black kid from the south, with the occasional appearance by the freckle faced kid from down the street that enlisted with you, hoping he wouldn’t die alone in a trench full of strangers, which of course, he did. Either way, I made it home in one piece.  
  
On the morning of July 26th, 1959, fifteen years after my return home from the Pacific, my clammy hands making the ink of the morning paper bleed onto the countertop as I stood wide-eyed, taking in the absolute horror of a story that I had found nestled between the personal ads and the sports section. It would be a falsehood for me to say the small voice in my head wasn’t pleading to the universe that it was fiction with every word my brain tried desperately to process as I scoured the story, which stretched nearly the entire page. A new recurring column perhaps? As if the world wasn’t full of enough horror, at least for the working class Joes like myself.  
  
The story detailed the gruesome journeyings of a couple of green, naive kids from my hometown. According to the story, on August 16th, 1936, a Sunday, the boys were experiencing the standard end of summer blues, and wanted to finally do something daring, more daring than sneaking out or making prank calls like most fifteen year old boys do. On that day, these two young men decided to poke around one of the two abandoned copper mines located on the outskirts of my hometown, Copper Hollow, Michigan.  
  
The town was cleverly named for the copper mines, which were first discovered by miners from the Northeast who followed the large river that ran through my town down South. The mines provided a huge economic boom for the area and Copper Hollow quickly sprawled into what it is today, which is still a small town by most people’s standards. Unfortunately for the mining industry, both of the mines were closed down in the early aughts under circumstances that rang mysterious to say the least. I remember my father telling me at the time that a lot of the miners were getting sick, not from the mining itself, but from something else down there. A lot of the guys that descended into the sprawling depths of the mines came back different to say the least. Many of them would be committed to the Asylum up in Traverse City, but even more would just starve themselves to death, without the courage to kill themselves off quickly and with too much fear to continue living. My father said that it was all a bunch of ghost stories to keep people out of the mines.  
  
Officially, many thought the workers went on strike, being miners at the time made very little, and never returned. Others thought the copper ran dry. Many that were close to the workers who were laid off at the time of the mine’s closing all claim that there were other, far more powerful and sinister things at play that forced its closure; nevertheless, the mining ceased and the formerly mineral-rich ground was sealed forever, or so I thought. According to the article, the workers, in a craze, boarded up all of the entrances except for one. This specific mineshaft was one of the first to be closed down, and was forgotten when the rest were sealed up.  
  
I remembered the initial story back in the 30s almost immediately. It was unclear to the authorities which of the two boys decided to convince the other to explore the abandoned mine, or which one of them objected, if they objected at all. If you’re superstitious like me, the first thing you’d wonder is what possessed these two young boys, who grew up hearing about how dangerous the mines were, and how eerie the circumstances of their closing were, to one day decide to venture into their abyssal depths.  
  
The article went on to recap from its initial story, that despite the best efforts of law enforcement, of course, only one of the two boys, a kid named Billy McKinnon, a young Irish fellow a few years younger than myself, made it safely back to the surface. The child was immediately rushed to the asylum fifty miles north of here for questioning, babbling on about some of the most horrifying things you’ve ever heard.  
  
From the beginning, they tried their best to pin a murder on Billy. The case had two major problems, the first being that no corpse was ever found, and the second being that police were convinced by the insane babblings that he made from the moment of his capture that he not only didn’t know where he was or what he was doing, but didn’t hold the mental capacity necessary to stand trial for murder. They shipped him off to the asylum in Traverse City, where he remained until today. The story indicated that after all this time, after years of authorities from multiple agencies contacting him, trying to get closure for the Jacobs family, a family I’d known through other acquaintances, he had finally decided to come forward with his portion of the story, to clear his name, and agreed to finally speak to authorities.  
  
A week after reading the article, I ran into a family friend of mine by the name of Archie Rucker, now a detective, who informed me he was in the fluorescent laden room when the now 38 year old Billy was being questioned. Initially, according to Archie, Billy seemed too scared to talk, but once pressured, he gave a full account of the events that took place, and even now I find it hard to comprehend exactly what Archie told me was said. To make sure they got everything, they brought in a stenographer from downstate, near Mt. Pleasant, I think. Under the table, Archie sent me a copy of the transcript. This is what they were able to type out between the babbling and groaning from McKinnon.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
On the morning of August 16th, 1936, my best friend in the whole world, Alex Jacobs and myself, decided that we were bored. To us, we were far more bored than any of the other kids in the neighborhood, whose parents had spent hundreds of dollars on toys, vacations, and expensive frozen desserts to beat the heat of the midwestern summer. We were broke, with only a few cents for the occasional Coca-Cola, a couple comic books, a deck of worn playing cards, and the type vivid, at times explicit imagination that ranged from deciding whether the Three Stooges or Popeye would win in a fight to observing how much bigger Laura Crowley’s chest had gotten over the last year. Boy stuff.  
	  
In the shadow of the morning sun we talked over the activities for the day, beginning with riding our bikes along the same trails of the town square, buying an ice cream soda from the creepy corner store owner they see every day for groceries anyhow, strolling the park, or doing something different, something fun, something dangerous. Honestly, a part of me wanted to one up Alex on the toughness scale, and another part of me didn’t understand what we were agreeing to, or understand the powers that be that aligned our destinies on this sunny, perfect morning. Regardless, somehow, we agreed to explore one of the abandoned copper mines, a former source of prosperity, peace, and happiness that slowly turned into a cesspool of legend and mystery.  
  
The first mine was out of the question. Unlike the haphazard exit of the second mine, the first had been demolished using dynamite when it was shut down to avoid anyone ever entering. Plus, that mine didn’t come with the shock factor the second mine had. The second mine was the one that carried the stories of ancient power, political and economic corruption, and the allure of a dangerous, daring adventure. I’m sure you can understand that a lot of this is a blur to me, I don’t remember which, but one of us decided on the second, and the other quickly agreed. The forgotten entrance we decided to use was a long-time hangout of some of the older teenagers, ne’er-do-wells, and miscreants for as long as I can remember. On this particular day, the entrance to the mine was untouched and unguarded, which left a perfect opportunity for us to not only enter the mine unbothered, but also unseen and undetected by the watchful eye of anyone who would try to stop us if they saw us.  
  
The entrance to the mine began small enough that we had to duck to get inside, but then opened up into a large, towering cavern, lined with railroad ties, rope, and nails the diameter of a dollar piece. A sturdy piece of architecture to be sure. My father is a steel worker, so I stole a couple of his big flashlights to make sure we didn’t go in blind. I knew he wouldn’t miss them, we wouldn’t be gone that long.  
  
When I first entered the mine, turned on the flashlight, and looked around, I felt the eagerness of a child on his first Christmas. My eyes ran rampant across the fixtures of rock and wood beams, taking in every inch of the caverns, memorizing their position, taking everything in. This was in part driven by the fear of getting lost in the unexplored territory and part eagerness to find the next portion of the tunnel that led deeper into the mine. Alex was the first to find the next tunnel, to the left of where we entered, in a seemingly obvious part of the cavern. He approached it first, slowly, flashing his light inside to illuminate, even if ever so slightly, the path ahead, and he entered with extreme caution to explore the next room.  
  
I followed him closely, feeling a lump in the back of my throat. It was very odd, being that I didn’t necessarily feel fear, but I knew I had no idea where the tunnel led. Along the tunnel floor, there lay pickaxes, barrels of safety equipment, rope, and crates of rock that appeared to contain a shiny ore. I thought to myself at that moment, it was a bit peculiar, even if the miners rushed out, to leave the equivalent of unclaimed money laying in the halls of the mineshaft, but honestly, I didn’t think too much beyond that.  
  
The tunnel seemed to go on forever. It felt like we were walking for ages. My feet began to get tired, and I felt the overwhelming urge to ask Alex to turn back and leave with me. At that moment, I felt a stronger urge to continue exploring. It reminded me a lot like the anticipation of going on a vacation, or to a football game, something that I’d looked forward to for a long time. As we entered deeper into the mine, without thinking about it, I felt the ceiling get shorter and shorter. This continued until we were waddling like ducks along the floor of the tunnel. Finally, the tunnel opened up into a large, stone room.  
  
The walls were smoothed down, as if it were intentionally built at the end of this tunnel. What was odd, and unsettling to say the least, was the lack of edge to anything in the room. Even the corners that led to the floor had a rounded edge to them, and even more, the entire room seemed to be made of one, solid stone. Alex and I both stared in awe at the room around us, and it took us a moment to finally realize that at the far end of the room, lay a large stone structure. We slowly approached it, initially thinking it was some sort of makeshift break area for the miners, but it wasn’t. It was unlike anything I’d ever seen before. It was clearly much older than the mines, and truthfully, much older than anything I’d ever seen in real life. It reminded me of some of the ancient Egyptian and Mayan structures you’d see in National Geographic.  
  
I walked toward the base of the structure, and I saw something that, even now, is extremely odd. There was a large book, like the kind you see in the library that has old newspapers in it. The great big books. This one was different though. Instead of the standard brown, cloth binding, this book was very ornate. The book itself was bound in a leather of some kind, unlike anything I had ever seen before. It was black in color, but contained sparkles within it, like the kind of metallic paint you see on a car. It was mesmerizing. The odd part wasn’t the book itself, interestingly enough. The odd part was that even though the book was clearly very old, perhaps hundreds of years old, there wasn’t a speck of dust on it. It appeared to be brand new. I slowly lifted the heavy cover open and shined my light on the pages. Written over and over on every page, for the entirety of the book were the words, written in a dark, black ink:  
  
“The Great Dreamer’s reign is near. Be ye ready.”  
  
As the book went on, the writing became fainter and fainter, as if someone sat down in front of the book and wrote out this phrase over and over, in one sitting. As if they were running out of ink. Suddenly, towards the end, the ink changed. It went from a dark black, to a deep, viscous red. I quickly shut the book in horror. After that, I didn’t know what to think. The thought of being in the cold, dark cavern, it was like I was feeling the tension of thousands of years of ritual and supernatural occurrences weighing me down, began to make my blood run cold.   
  
Everyone had heard stories of mysterious beings and energies dwelling deep within the mine, and this seemed to confirm that. It’s very easy to see how horrifying it would have been to be in that place now, but in that moment, it felt like every second of my life led me to this moment, this moment of clarity, this moment of understanding, this moment of finally realizing my greatest purpose. It was like I’d wanted to be here my entire life, though I knew in the back of my mind that wasn’t true.   
  
As we stood there for a moment in the complete silence and solitude of the underground cavern, suddenly Alex got my attention, and directed it towards the ceiling, where an even larger structure jutted out from the wall creating a large effigy. The carving, even now, I have a hard time describing. If you were to ask me what I saw, I would say that I saw the head of a large black squid attached to a human body with black, scaly skin, posed as if climbing through the wall towards us. Its arms were stretched wide as if almost embracing those in the room. The eyes were what terrified me the most. They were burning red, searing, as if they could see into my very soul. On the walls around us, we began to notice further carvings, which created the impression of wings. For a moment, just a moment in the dark, I could have sworn I saw it breathe.  
  
Even now, I wonder if I saw anything at all, or if my mind tried desperately to fill the void of some traumatic event or some underlying fear that I carried with me into the cavern. Another part of me knows for certain exactly what I saw there. We stood and marveled at the sheer architectural feat that the effigy was for a moment. It felt like we could stand there forever, taking in every painstakingly carved out detail of the effigy.  
  
Out of nowhere, my ears began to focus on a sound coming from behind the stone structure. It sounded like the slow drip of a tap that wasn’t completely shut off. I saw Alex look in the same direction I was, and flash his light that way. We walked around toward the back of the structure, using our hands to guide us along the smooth, cold limestone towards the source of the dripping. As we made our way around, there was a small opening in the rock, smoothed to a round edge, that led to a large staircase, the only right angles in the place, that led down into a dark abyss. Alex and I looked at each other, both of us scared out of our minds.  
  
“No turning back now.” Alex said, his voice calm and confident, contrasting completely from his scared, timid nature that I had become familiar with over the course of our friendship.  
  
We nodded to one another, and slowly made our descent into the depths of the abyss. Our flashlights at this point were no help, as they only seemed to show the next ten stairs or so. We took each step slowly, carefully, never a step out of place. In the quick glances I took at the walls of the staircase, I noticed the same characterization of the effigy above in various scenes. The one I remember best was one of the effigy coming out of a large body of water. I don’t remember more than that, but I know they lined the entire staircase.  
  
At this point we had been climbing down deep underground for what felt like forever. If I had to guess, I would think we went down at least 10 to 12 stories. The dripping seemed to get louder and louder until it was almost like the sound of a waterfall. Finally, halls of the staircase opened up to a slightly larger room, smaller than the first cavern but with the same smooth stone walls. In the center was a pool of water, maybe six or seven feet in diameter, with a slow, soft drip coming from the ceiling dropping into it, making the sound. From here, the dripping sounded much calmer, much softer than in the staircase we had traversed.  
  
We approached the pool and shined our lights inside. It was the most beautiful, clear water I’d ever seen. At this depth, it even had a slight blue hue to it, like the ocean. Alex seemed much more enthralled by it than I, but it was extremely beautiful. The longer I looked at it, the more I wanted to touch the immaculate, blue water. Suddenly, I became thirsty. Thirstier than I’d felt my entire life. I’d have given anything for a Coke from the creepy corner store at the end of the block, or even the lukewarm water from the hose at home; but I knew, I knew for sure, that the best water in the world was in that pool.  
  
My long, pasty white fingers slowly drifted down towards the water to retrieve a drink for myself. As they slowly, daringly approached, the feelings of desire for the water only grew. But before I could take a drink, Alex quickly placed both of his hands, making a bowl out of them, into the cold, dark water, pulled them up, and drank. Alex paused for a moment, his eyes wide, and he began to quickly gulp down the water, like an animal.  
  
I didn’t know what to do. Yes, the water looked good and yes, I wanted to drink it. I don’t know what it was about seeing him drink the dark, blue cave water, but it made all desires to drink the water fade away, as if they never happened in the first place. All I could feel in that moment was dread. It felt like I was waiting for something horrible to happen. It’s like watching a horror movie, waiting for the inevitable entrance of a monster in the form of a jump scare, but this time, a monster didn’t come. I couldn’t watch him drink anymore and turned away. In place of a monster, and I know this will sound crazy, a voice began to speak inside my head. For a moment I had to convince myself that it wasn’t my own thoughts, but the thoughts of another, more powerful force. The voice was deep, gravely, and sounded like a demon if you put it through a distortion machine like they use for movies and in recording studios. The tone of the voice was somber and absolute, with the level headed delivery that you’d expect talking to a deity.  
  
“Did you hear that?” I asked Alex, my eyes veering back to him for the first time since he drank the water.  
  
Alex was staring into the pool, unmoving, his attention focused completely on something moving in the water.  
  
“Alex? Are you okay?”  
  
Silence.  
  
“This isn’t funny, Alex. We need to go.”  
  
I got up to leave, and he grabbed my wrist with strength I’d never seen from him before. He pulled me back to the kneeling position I had taken up next to the pool, and turned to lock eyes with me, but they weren’t his eyes. His eyes were a black void. A void that I can only liken to that of the backdrops of movies that take place in space. Absolute nothingness. No emotion. No empathy. Just an endless void.  
  
“Did you understand what the Great Old One said, Billy?”  
  
“Who? What are you talking about? You heard the voice?” I replied.  
  
“In this shrine to R’lyeh, the Great Dreamer’s slumber has been interrupted.”  
  
“Alex, you’re scaring me. I-”  
  
It was at that moment that I noticed the long, thick, rope-like tentacle sticking out of the back of Alex’s head. It was surrounded by a steady stream of crimson blood. In a flash, Alex’s body was plunged into the pool, the entirety of him disappearing into its cold depths. I looked deep into the water, frozen in fear, trying to find any signs of life. Just as quick as he went into the water, I saw something begin to float towards the top of the pool. I slowly peered over the edge to get a better look, and suddenly I was face to face with my best friend, frantically trying to swim to the surface. I screamed for him, oh how I screamed for him.   
  
When he finally looked like he was about to crest the surface, he stopped. It was like he ran into a plate of glass. He started to bang his hands against it, and it was clear he couldn’t get through. I wanted so desperately to just reach in and grab him, to rescue him, to save him. I wanted with everything in my heart, body, mind, and spirit to help my friend out of that pool and to leave that place forever. I sat there, frozen, willing my body to move. Willing myself to reach in, grab his hand, and end this horrible adventure we had so innocently begun together, but could end with his death. His knocks became fainter and fainter, and I watched in horror as he fell deeper into the depths. As he descended into the darkness of the pit below, I could make out the faintest outline of a tentacle wrapping around his neck, dragging him down to his demise.  
  
A lot of what happened after that is a blur. I don’t know if I screamed, cried, or did nothing at all. I don’t remember how long it took me to traverse the staircase back to the large cavern, but when I reached the top is when I began to regain my full awareness of my surroundings. As I turned the corner around the large stone structure that led us to the staircase in the first place, I came face to face with a room of 20 or more hooded individuals, each holding a gas lantern, aflame enough for me to see the dark, black, metallic fabric of their robes, adorned with golden sashes.  
  
They began to chant in the same language I had heard in my head in the cavern below, and I prepared to meet a similar demise to my friend. Their tone was not that of a hostile force, nor that of a friendly one. Their tone was almost fearful, yet calm and accepting, like the prayers of a convict on their way to the gallows. I slowly began to make my way around the outside of the room, following the wall to the entrance Alex and I had used to enter the cavern. Once I found it, I ran as fast as I could down the tunnel toward the large cave we first entered through. When I finally got there after what felt like ages of running, my eyes found the tunnel with the faintest light pouring into it. My heart jumped as I quickly traversed it to the surface. As I felt the crisp, open air reach me, I closed my eyes to shield them from the afternoon sun, the clouds had passed.  
  
My eyes slowly began to adjust to the outside, my vision beginning to darken as I normalized the world outside of the mine. The horrible sight that my eyes saw as they opened can only be explained as demonic, and unnatural. When I opened my eyes, I saw nothing but long, green pastures. Land that stretched for miles beyond where my hometown once stood. Gone were the streets, the cars, the buildings, and most frightening of all, the people. Above me, the sun was moving across the sky at a rate I could perceive with the naked eye, much faster than usual. As night came, the moon moved faster across the sky. The days began to fade by quicker and quicker, turning into months, and years, all before my very eyes. I began to see structures emerge from the ground, blurs of people swirling around the new structures, the emergence of technology, and my hometown returning to the state it was when I left it. I felt like it seemed to freeze in that time for just a moment before the sun and the moon became even faster, the stars moving so quickly that the sky became white with starlight.  
  
At once, when the Copper Hollow that I knew and had grown up in had died away, with only the bones remaining and new, silver structures lining its freshly paved city-like streets, the curbs lined with small spaceship-like vehicles. The sky faded once again to dusk and stopped. To my right, along the river, the wide expanse of the river began to move as a large, horrifying being emerged from its depths. I can picture it so vividly, yet the words to describe it are unknown to me. I don’t think that humans are ever supposed to see anything like that unless it’s the last thing they ever see. The only thing I remember was a large, black mass, shiny, scaly skin, claws, and a face of tentacles, but most of all, the huge blue and green eyes.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
The article concluded that just as Billy McKinnon was describing the horrible sight of the ferocious being he saw emerging from the river on the date in question, he suffered a massive heart attack and died within seconds. With the new evidence, the police decided to search the mine again, using Billy’s account as a roadmap to Alex’s last known whereabouts. They found the large cavern that Billy talked about, but the book and the carving were missing. As they descended into the staircase, just where Billy said it was, behind a corner of rock, they found the pool. Next to the pool, with rope wrapped around his neck, was the body of Alex Jacobs, still wearing the same clothes he was reported to be wearing when he disappeared in 1936.  
  
Every inch of the corpse was inexplicably soaking wet.  
  
A part of me wonders if they heard a mysterious voice, all their lives, slowly whispering into their deepest recesses to convince them to venture in. Perhaps they were able to hold off such calls into the voids of the mine for years, their impressionable state as very young children allowing them to buy into their parents’ pleas to never enter there, but no longer. Perhaps some ancient force existed beneath the mines long before the first humans set foot in this land. Perhaps it was always meant to stay hidden within the hills and mountains, but the miners somehow discovered it, and released it.  
  
If Billy is right, there is no stopping the force that lies in the depths of that mineshaft, or any other forces like it that have operated all around us for millions of years. From my very temporary, short existence, it can be easy to infer that, if after all this time they’ve laid dormant outside of those few outliers who choose to tamper with it, that it will not threaten our species. Even if we were to threaten their incomprehensible power outright, the only path that our young, naive species as a whole can go down, like Billy and Alex, will lead to the entirety of our consciousness screaming into an unanswering void, begging for the release of death and the blissful ignorance of such unknowable, unimaginable horrors that await within the black indifference of the universe beyond, the entities there, by their very existence alone, preying on the deepest, darkest fears of our race. Fears that are so locked away deep within the fabric of our reality, that we cannot pretend to understand or comprehend them.
