I know that after you’ve read the title, you must be confused. The time? What does she mean? Let me tell you what I mean, but beforehand, you will need to understand what happened before I saw the time, and let me tell you, most people don’t get to understand because they look at the clock themselves while they read this, and then... it’s over for them; they’re gone. So now that you’re reading this, be careful, and until the end of this text, do not look at the clock. 

I was getting ready in my bathroom at around 5:30 to go out with some friends after work. Nothing unusual, just jamming to music, putting makeup on, and using my curling iron as a microphone. I wasn’t aware at the time that the news channel on my TV was showing what it showed. I wasn’t aware that my friends were texting me to leave my house. It was in "do not disturb" mode. I just wanted my me time, and now I so regret it. 

By the time I noticed something was off, it was already too late. All I recall is getting off “do not disturb” and seeing floods of messages from my friends and family asking if I was okay. Ashley, my best friend, called me so many times that I instantly called her back. I heard cries of fear when she answered me, and in a deep voice, she told me that she was at my door. 

I left my bathroom, confused about the sound of her voice, and went to my living room, where the front door was located. Before I could open the door, I received another text message. It was Ashley, and it said, “DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR, THIS ISN’T ME.” So I didn't; no matter how hard it knocked and how much it sounded like her, I didn’t open the door. I was glued to my TV screen; it was now 6:30. 

*“This is a state of emergency; the authorities are asking the population to lock their doors and not trust anyone, not even relatives. There have been multiple disappearances and reports of people disappearing and coming back violent. We just now had a report sent to us, and we believe 10,000 people across the world have been victims of this. Until we know more about the situation, shelter yourselves. Stay Sa-”* 

I then watched multiple people in the TV studio run for their lives as some of the staff entered the studio and decided to go on a killing spree. Everything was filmed live, and I didn’t know what to do because, realistically, when the world is going to shit..what can you do? 

By the time I could find the strength to look away, it was 6:55. The knocks on my door stopped, it was silent; the news channel stopped broadcasting, and all I could hear were distant screams coming from the streets. I walked towards my bedroom, hid in my closet, and cried. I’m not the type to fight, as you can see. I’m more of a flight person. 

Now I hope you didn’t look at the time yet, because I’m not finished with the story. After I was done crying, I looked at the time, and let me tell you, and it sent chills down my spine. It was now 6:61. How is this possible? I can’t tell you because I don’t know myself. All I know is that I received a government alert asking for the remaining people alive to NOT look at the clock because anyone looking at it once it reaches 6:66 will be a victim of whatever is attacking us all. And whoever is unaware of what is happening and reading this only now becoming aware of it must not look at the time from now on, or else this hell I’m in, you will live in it too. 

Now, I know you want to look at the time; time is how we measure things in life. So I found a way, you must forget, you must forget you’ve ever read this, you must forget you are aware that they are here, forget but remember that feeling of uneasiness because if they ever get back at you, you must remember again to not look at the time.
