The night was quiet, too quiet, as I sat alone in my small apartment. The clock ticked loudly, each second echoing in the stillness. I had just moved in, eager for a fresh start after a messy breakup. The walls were bare, the furniture sparse—just a couch, a table, and my laptop. I felt a strange mix of excitement and unease, but I brushed it off as the jitters of a new beginning.

As the hours passed, I decided to binge-watch a horror series to embrace the ambiance of my new home. The screen flickered with shadows and eerie sounds that made me jump, but I laughed it off. My phone buzzed on the table, a message from my best friend reminding me to lock the door. I smiled, feeling a sense of camaraderie despite my isolation.

Around midnight, I heard it—a soft scratching sound coming from the window. I paused the show and turned to face the sound, convinced it was just the wind. But then it happened again, louder this time, like fingernails dragging against the glass. My heart raced. I stood up, walking cautiously toward the window, peering into the darkness outside. Nothing. Just the empty street illuminated by the occasional flicker of a streetlight.

I tried to shake off the anxiety creeping in. Perhaps it was just a tree branch, I thought. I returned to the couch, but the scratching continued, more persistent now. I covered my ears, trying to drown it out with the show’s dialogue, but it only grew louder, more frantic. I couldn’t ignore it any longer.

Gathering my courage, I approached the window again. This time, I pulled back the curtain and stared into the night. My breath caught in my throat. There, just outside my window, was a figure—pale, gaunt, with hollow eyes staring directly at me. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my chest. I blinked, hoping it was a trick of my imagination, but when I looked again, it was still there, unmoving.

I grabbed my phone, ready to call for help, but the figure raised a finger to its lips, shushing me. Fear gripped me, and I pressed my back against the wall, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. It felt surreal, like a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.

Suddenly, the scratching stopped, and the figure faded into the shadows, leaving me in the dim glow of my apartment. I was paralyzed with fear, unsure of what to do next. I locked the window, pulled the curtains shut, and retreated to my bedroom, my mind racing with thoughts of who—or what—I had just seen.

Hours passed, and sleep eluded me. I lay in bed, hearing every creak of the building, every rustle of the wind outside. Just as I began to doze off, I heard the scratching again, not from the window this time, but from my bedroom door. My heart dropped, and I held my breath, straining to hear. It was soft at first, but then it grew louder, more insistent.

I felt trapped in my own skin, paralyzed by fear. The scratching continued, and I could hear a whisper, barely audible, “Let me in…” It echoed in my mind, sending chills down my spine. I couldn’t move, couldn’t speak. The world around me faded as I succumbed to the terror.

The next morning, I awoke to sunlight streaming through my window, the scratching and whispers gone. I convinced myself it was all a bad dream, a product of my overactive imagination. But as I got up to make coffee, I noticed something on my bedroom floor—a small, muddy handprint, fingers splayed as if someone had tried to reach for me.

I left that apartment the same day, never looking back. Sometimes at night, I still hear the whispers, echoing in the silence, reminding me of the figure that came too close to my reality. And I wonder if it ever found someone else to let in.
