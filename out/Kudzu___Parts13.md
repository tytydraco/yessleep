My name is Cullen Peek. I’m a detective with the state police.

A few days ago, I got a phone call I wasn’t expecting—from someone I hadn’t heard from in years. Her daughter, Carmen, is missing.

I’m documenting everything here in case it helps. If nothing else, it’s a record that I tried.

Part 1 The Call

My grandma likes to brag about me being a cop—too much sometimes. So when I became a detective earlier last year, it wasn’t a surprise that everyone back home found out too. They had probably heard about the promotion from her, most likely the day it happened.

Normally, people would reach out and ask dumb stuff they could find online in five minutes: “If my neighbor won’t give my dog back, what should I do?” That kind of thing. I never really minded answering and helping, as old as it got.

This last request was different. More serious. Not something they could just Google or ask for advice about.

One day at work, my personal phone came to life with the familiar buzz of a call. I didn’t know the number, so I let it go to voicemail—figured if it was important, they’d leave a message.

Then the phone started ringing again. Same number. This time, I felt compelled to answer.

When I put the phone to my ear, I could instantly hear a woman softly crying on the other end. Her sadness tried to reach through the phone and grab hold of me.

I can’t recall everything she said in that call. But I remember this much: her daughter Carmen was missing.

Every time I asked what happened, she’d break into a crying fit before answering any of my questions. Then she’d apologize for crying. Over and over.

In the short pauses between the tears, she explained her daughter was gone. When she said Carmen’s name, I froze a little—I’ll admit that.

This wasn’t a stranger like all the other cases I’ve worked. It wasn’t someone I’d never met.

This was a girl I knew. Someone I once cared for.

Carmen was kind.

I hate saying “was,” like I know she’s gone. But the truth is, at the time of writing this, I have no clue if she *is* or *was*.

Then, in the middle of a crying fit, the call abruptly ended. And all my questions were put on pause.

I write reports at work far too often, so I’m going to document this too. If nothing comes of this whole thing, it’ll sit as a reminder that I tried to do something. Or even just a small glimpse of kindness in this cruel world.

October 10th, 2015

I called Carmen’s mom back today. Decided to record the call with an audio recorder, just to keep a record of things. Even though I know the girl who’s missing, it’s still “work,” so I hit record and made the call.

Female voice: Hello?

Cullen: Is this Krystal Martin?

Krystal: Cullen! Thank you for calling me back... I’m sorry about the other day, I couldn’t hold it together. It’s... it’s—

Cullen: Hard.

Krystal: Yes... I really don’t know what to do. I’m scared, mad, sad.

\[Krystal begins to cry\]

Krystal: Do... do you think you can help me?

Cullen: Well, I’m not sure exactly what I can do, but I’ll need to hear the complete story of what’s going on.

Krystal: That’s more than the police here are doing. They don’t even listen to me. Carmen never leaves like this... she wouldn’t go somewhere without letting someone know. She has a job! She *loves* her job! She wouldn’t just leave.

Cullen: When’s the last time you heard from her?

Krystal: She left my house last week. It was Tuesday.

\[Long pause\]

She ate dinner with us, then left saying she needed to go home to let her dog out. I tried to call her Wednesday... I’ve tried to call her every day since then. Nothing.

Cullen: Well Krystal, she is 28 now, maybe—

\[A loud noise is heard\]

Krystal: *DON’T YOU DARE* say she just ran off! Don’t even try that with me... that’s exactly what the police told me when I called.

Cullen: Ms. Martin, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to insinuate that she would’ve done that—I’m just thinking through all the possibilities.

Krystal: I’m sorry I yelled at you, Cullen. She just wouldn’t do that. I know her... you know her too.

Cullen: I don’t think she would either, ma’am. Have you called her friends?

Krystal: I’ve called everyone. All her coworkers, old friends, new friends—anyone who has anything to do with her. No one has seen or heard from her.

Cullen: Mrs. Martin, give me some time. You know I don’t work in Livisah County, so I’m gonna give them a call and see what I can find out, okay?

Krystal: Okay.

\[Slight crying picks back up\] Let me know if you find anything.

Cullen: You know I will, ma’am.

October 10th, 2015 (continued)

As much as I’d like to just drive down there and help investigate, I can’t do it professionally unless I’m invited into the investigation by the Livisah County Sheriff’s Office or Town Police. But I didn’t feel like explaining that to her—it would’ve just seemed like an excuse not to help.

So I decided to attempt to get in contact with someone who works there. I called their dispatch. After explaining who I was and flashing my title over the phone, the dispatcher gave me the number of the detective in charge of the case: Detective Barton.

So I called him.

Recording #2

Phone rings

Barton: Detective Barton speaking

(I could feel the irritation in his voice. Someone who had just stress-smoked a pack of cigarettes and could care less about a phone call.)

Cullen: Hey, sir. This is Detective Peek with the State Police. I received a call from Mrs. Martin about Carmen. She said she was missing. I told her I’d call and ask if you had found anything.

Barton: Cullen?! Shit, it’s been a while, man!

(His voice changed significantly, going from a man who wanted the world to burn to a happy-go-lucky guy. Regardless, I couldn’t for the life of me remember who he was or how he knew me. As if he could feel the confusion from my end, he quickly spoke again.)

Barton: We graduated high school together, man! It’s Kyle.

Cullen: Oh dang! Kyle Barton—how are you, man? It’s been a minute.

Barton: I’m good, dude! And congratulations on the promotion. As you can see, I’m right here with you—"Detective" and all. But if I’m being honest with you, man... (He seemed to pause for an odd moment.) I’ve got a lot of shit on my hands. Everything from B&Es to a couple of missing kid cases that got dumped in my lap when the old man retired. So I haven’t had much time to look into Carmen. But between me and you, she probably just ran off. Nobody wants to be in this town. You know that... more than most.

Cullen: Sounds like you're pretty busy nowadays. I honestly figured that’s all this was, but like I said, I just told her I’d give you guys a call and see what’s up. Didn’t mean to bother.

Barton: Didn’t bother me a bit, dude! I’m happy to take a break from all this. But I’ll tell you what—if you're willing to look into Carmen being “missing” (saying it in a mocking manner), I’d love to pawn this case off on you. Carmen’s fine, I’m sure.

I thought for a minute, wondering if I could talk my sergeant into letting me work the case. Knowing I’m two hours away and would need somewhere to stay made it tricky.

Cullen: Let me get back to you on that. I’ll have to see if it’ll get approved on my end first.

Barton: Just let me know, Cullen. I’d appreciate the assistance.

Call ends

After that conversation, I debated it for a while. I hadn’t been back home in a long time, and I hadn’t spoken to Carmen—or anyone—for at least two years. I had no idea what to do, so in a stupid attempt to test fate, I flipped a coin. Heads I’d go, tails I’d stay.

As the coin flew through the air and came down from its dance, it bounced off my hand and rolled across the floor, farther and farther away from me. I sat there, dumbfounded.

It was just a stupid coin.

Then I wondered—maybe this was God saying I needed to choose for myself. And who am I to let the big man upstairs down?

I called my sergeant’s office line and asked if he had time for a quick word. After explaining the situation, he surprisingly told me that if it was something I wanted to do and I’d been formally invited to help, I could go.

**Part 2 Homecoming**

My hometown, Jesse, West Virginia, in Livisah County, was a strange place. On a map, it’s tucked right between Kentucky and Virginia. Honestly, it’s like neither of those states would claim it, so West Virginia did. It’s the same as every other town in this area—rolling, ancient mountains that have seen more than they’d probably want to talk about, and the most notable thing being old coal mines. I mean a lot of old mines. I don’t think any in Livisah County are still open. This is one of the reasons the local economy here is terrible.

They say at one time it was booming, always growing. People from everywhere flooding in to get a mining job or open a business. Now all that’s left is some big scars in the earth and the skeleton of a dead town. Nature began to take it all back once life started to bleed out of it. Vines growing over everything. The buildings on the edge of town honestly remind you of something out of an apocalyptic movie.

October 13th, 2015

As I pulled into my grandma's driveway, it looked exactly the same as when I left years ago. She was sitting on her front porch, smoking. I got out of my car and she yelled from the porch, “I don’t wanna buy nothin!” She started to get up, probably to shake her fist—or if I’d been one of the unlucky intruders, grab her shotgun. But before either, she realized it was me. Limping up to me, she gave me a hug.

I explained to her I was here for work. I asked if she’d mind if I stayed here while I was in town. She looked at me like the question was stupid—or like I should’ve already known the answer. I put my bags in my old room. As soon as I walked in, it was obvious she hadn’t touched a thing since the day I left.

Before I could tell her not to go to any trouble, she was already in the kitchen cooking. She’d probably make a ridiculous amount of food and force me to eat more than I needed because “Cullen, you look like you're starving,” and honestly, I don’t have the ability to tell her no. She was my favorite person, the woman who raised me single-handedly. She worked for the mine office as a secretary before retiring around the time I came into the picture.

She was tough. Got arrested four times while I was growing up—for getting in fights with other old women, men, and most notably, the Chief of Police. She took pride in that one, hanging the newspaper article on the fridge right next to my graduation photo from the Police Academy.

After eating three servings, I said I needed to run into town. While taking a pull from her cigarette, she said, “Why run when you got that car parked in the driveway?” I laughed and walked to the car.

I drove into town and headed toward the police department to get the formalities handled before starting work. I picked up the report that had been filed on the case. It was one page, with no information other than “Carmen Martin possibly missing” and Krystal’s contact info. I was annoyed at how little effort had gone into it.

I asked the office worker where everyone was, noticing there were no officers around. She told me they were all tied up on some calls. I decided I’d go see Krystal and get caught up in person.

On the way, I saw some posters with Carmen’s picture. I assumed Mrs. Martin had put them out. Carmen was average height, skinny, with dark brown hair and green eyes. She had a beautiful face. If the picture was recent, she hadn’t changed much.

I continued to drive to her mother’s house. When I arrived, I knocked on the door and was instantly pulled inside by Krystal.

“Cullen! Thank you so much for helping me.”

“It’s not a problem, ma’am. Can you answer some questions so I can start looking?”

“Yes, Cullen. Any questions you have.”

I asked the usual things: who does she hang out with, where does she live, names of anyone she might be with.

Krystal hesitated.

“It sounds like she was a loner when I say this, but I’m who she would normally be with, if not at work. She had friends, sure! But she would see me almost every day.”

“I understand, but is there anyone else she would go see? Boyfriend? Best friend? And where does she work?”

“Well, she would go out with Paige sometimes. She didn’t have a boyfriend that I was aware of. She’s the librarian at the elementary school.”

After writing down Paige’s name, I asked, “Have you been to her house and looked around?”

“I did go and peek through the windows, but I didn’t see anything. Her car wasn’t there either.”

“Since she’s been missing for nine days as of today, would you give me permission to go inside her home?”

Krystal filled out the form giving me permission as a family member of a missing person to enter Carmen’s home. She also gave me a photo. I assumed it was just a picture of Carmen, but when I looked at it, memories flooded back. It was a prom photo from Carmen’s junior year. She was wearing a black dress with red designs coming up the side. I had on a tux that barely fit and a red tie.

“I wanted you to have that, Cullen. To remind you that you know her... and she wouldn’t just run away from her family.”

After leaving Krystal’s house, I headed to Carmen’s. It was only a couple of miles from the school. First, I knocked on the front door. Knocked again. “Carmen, it’s Cullen Peek. I’m here to check on you.”

No answer.

I looked around the house. Through the windows. Everything looked clean. I tried the front door. Locked. Then the back. When I turned the knob, it surprisingly opened.

I cracked the door slowly, making sure no smell of decay poured out. Nothing. “Carmen, it’s Cullen. I’m trying to get up with you and make sure you’re okay.” Silence. Just creaks of the old house and a cool fall breeze.

I hadn’t spoken to Carmen in years. She was my best friend once. I secretly still cared about her, even though I had no idea how she felt about me. Last time we spoke, she was angry. I can’t even remember what started it. If she was inside this house, would she hug me? Ask me how I was? Or slap me and tell me to leave?

Deep down, I hoped she’d be here.

Her house was neat. Very clean. No clutter, no anything really. Yeah, she had clothes in her closet, and books on a small shelf, but that was it. No pictures on the wall, no junk piled up on the counter, not even a TV. The only thing in the living room was a couch, a small coffee table, a lamp, and an old board game sitting in the middle of the table, still in its well-used box. The house felt empty. Lifeless.

Her bedroom was the only space that showed signs someone lived there. The bed was messy, blankets curled up and hanging off the side, and a laptop was open where a head would normally rest. It was still plugged into a nearby outlet. I touched the trackpad. The screen lit up and showed a video feed of my car sitting in her driveway.

Not that crazy. Maybe she left it running for safety. A bit paranoid, but not wild. I minimized the video feed. A document was pulled up with a list of names and dates:

Sarah Street 03/12/10Misty Adkins 11/01/11Racheal Paris 05/25/12 - 06/01/12Bailey Short 09/10/12Emilee Richardson 03/01/13Alison Peters 01/12/14Parker Griffin 06/29/15

“Everything in the b—”

That’s where it ended.

I didn’t understand what it meant. Birthdays? I didn’t recognize any of the names. I tried to rewind the video feed, but when I hit the playback button, it said there were no recordings. Just a live feed.

I searched the house some more but found nothing else helpful. I decided to take the laptop with me.

While leaving, I remembered something Krystal had said—that Carmen left to let her dog out. That stuck out, because there wasn’t a dog. No signs of one. No bowl, no leash, no fur.

I made a note to ask Krystal later.

I locked the back door before I left. Mostly just so no one would steal from her. I’d been inside for at least an hour, and now it was dark.

Of course, I’d left my flashlight in the car.

As I walked to the car in the dark, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Like a laser beam on the back of my neck. I turned around, expecting to see something. Nothing.

Then, as I reached for the car door, I heard the sound of gravel crunching. I turned again.

A man was standing at the edge of the driveway. Short. Chubby. Hidden by the darkness.

“Can I help you?” I asked.

“No.”

He pointed to the house. “Carmen lives here.”

“Yeah, she does. Have you seen her recently?” I tried to sound calm.

“Ain’t seen her none in days,” he said, turning to walk down the road.

“What’s your name?” I called after him. No response.

I grabbed my flashlight from the car and jogged after him. But when I reached the road, he was gone.

“Where’d you go?” I shouted. “Hello?”

Nothing.

Nighttime silence is different than daytime silence. During the day, quiet can feel peaceful. At night, in the mountains, surrounded by nothing but trees, silence feels like the sun has forgotten you exist. The darkness swallows you up.

After a few more seconds of stillness, I walked back to the car.

Driving back to Grandma’s, I tried to remember everything I could about Carmen. I’ll admit it: I’d started to forget things. That made me sad. She was someone I cared about. My prom date. First kiss. First love.

Time fades memories like rain on a painting. You can still see the base layer, but the details are gone.

But her laugh? That I still remembered. She’d get mad when I teased her about it.

I pulled into the driveway and called it a night, storing the laptop on the desk.

The next morning, I was woken by the smell of breakfast.

Grandma: “So how are you, sweetie?”

Me: “I’m alright. A little tired, but I’ll make it.”

Grandma: “Did you find Ms. Carmen yet?”

Me: “Not yet. Honestly don’t know where I should look.”

Grandma: “You’ll figure it out. And if you don’t, then you don’t. Now eat! You won’t figure nothing out on an empty stomach!”

Me: “You remember much about Carmen?”

Grandma: “You think I’ve got dementia? How could I forget that girl! She did everything with ya. You two were glued together! Figured you’d get married, but you must’ve screwed that up. Never told me what happened there.”

Grandma lit a cigarette.

Me: “Thought you were gonna quit.”

Grandma: “Thought you were gonna mind ya own business after the last time you said that to me.”

Me: “I’ve missed you.”

After breakfast, I got ready and went to the elementary school where Carmen worked.

**Part 3 The School**

After breakfast, I got ready and went to the elementary school where Carmen worked. The school looked exactly the same as it always had. Probably hadn’t changed since the day it was built.

I walked inside and was met by a grouchy woman at the front office who was scolding a small child covered in black ink. I assumed he’d broken a pen—or a few. She sent him away and introduced herself as Nancy Helmsley.

I introduced myself and explained I was looking into Carmen’s disappearance.

Nancy: “Oh, Ms. Martin! Is she okay? I’ve been worried sick about that girl!”

Me: “Ma’am, her family’s informed me that she’s missing. I’m trying to find her.”

Nancy: “Dear God, that’s horrible. She’s been a no-show for a couple days now. I knew something was wrong deep down.”

Me: “What makes you say that?”

Nancy: “She was acting funny last couple of times she came in. Asking Paul stuff. Got him real pissed, if you want to know the truth. That girl walked out of the office with determination that day.”

Me: “Who’s Paul? And what do you mean, ‘asking stuff’?”

Nancy: “Paul Stanley. He’s the principal here. I don’t know what questions. God, you ask a bunch, though.”

Me: “That’s kind of my job, ma’am. How do you know she was asking him anything?”

Nancy: “She walked right through that door and said she was going to. I asked her what she needed, and she just said, ‘I need to ask Paul something.’”

Me: “Where is Paul now?”

Nancy: “Well, it’s three o’clock, so he probably left early like always.”

Me: “Thank you, ma’am.”

I asked if there were any teachers around who knew Carmen well. Nancy told me about two women who had what she mockingly called a "book club"—Ms. Hatfield and Ms. Carroll. According to her, it was just wine and gossip. She pointed me toward their classrooms.

First, I visited Ms. Carroll. I knocked on her classroom door and was met by a short, silver-haired woman.

Me: “Are you Ms. Carroll?”

Ms. Carroll: “Yes... can I help you?”

Me: “I have some questions about Carmen. She’s missing, and I’m trying to find her.”

Ms. Carroll: “I told her she was missing! Hold on right here!”

She stormed off down the hall, heels clicking against the tile. While she was gone, I stepped into her classroom. A photo on her desk caught my eye—it showed her, another woman, and Carmen sitting on a couch, smiling wide and glowing with happiness.

Ms. Carroll returned with the other woman from the photo.

Ms. Carroll: “Will you say that again so Liz can hear you?”

Me: “Liz?”

Ms. Carroll: “This is Elisabeth Hatfield. I’ve been telling her Carmen was missing! Also, quit calling me Ms. Carroll. I’m Emily.”

Me: “Nice to meet you both. I’m Detective Peek with the State Police. Like I explained to Emily, Carmen’s mother has reported her missing. I’m just trying to start looking.”

Emily: “I told you, Liz! I told you something was wrong, and what did you say? ‘Oh, she just went out of town!’”

Liz: “How was I supposed to know? She’s gone out of town before. She always said she hated it here.”

Me: “There’s no point arguing. And to be totally honest, we don’t know yet if something’s wrong. She might have just left.”

Liz: “See! She’s probably fine, Emily.”

Emily: “Detective Whatever-Your-Name-Is, something *is* wrong. I know it. And so does her mom, even if she doesn’t want to admit it.”

Me: “What do you mean by that?”

Emily: “Her mom hates me. Because I’m not a churchgoer and I drink. She always made Carmen feel bad for hanging out with us because of it. Carmen used to lie to her, make up stories about where she was. If you’ve met her mom, you’d understand.”

Liz: “Don’t be mean, Emily.”

Me: “I’ve met her. When was the last time you two saw Carmen?”

Both: “Tuesday.”

Liz: “She was at work Tuesday. Just didn’t show up the next day.”

Emily: “She also argued with the asshole the week before.”

Me: “Who’s ‘the asshole’?”

Liz: “That’s what Emily and Carmen call Paul, the principal.”

Me: “Got it. What did they argue about?”

Emily: “Not sure. Carmen wouldn’t tell us. I just know it upset her. She cried and went home early that day.”

Liz: “She never did say why she went in there.”

Emily began pacing the room, her heels clicking with every step.

Me: “She never mentioned going to speak with Paul?”

Emily: “No. And that in itself is odd. She told us everything.”

Liz: “She really did. Maybe she did leave, Emily. Maybe she’s going to chase that guy who broke her heart. She always talked about it.”

I paused. Was she talking about me? I pushed the thought aside.

Emily: “She definitely would’ve told us that—and you know it.”

The school bell rang.

Liz: “We’ll have to continue this later. We’ve got to get the kids on the buses.”

They stepped outside and stood in front of their classrooms. Kids poured into the hallway like a flood. At the opposite end, I noticed a man standing still. He was short, chubby, probably in his late 30s, wearing a janitor uniform that had seen better days. He was staring at the wall, mouth slightly open. When he saw me looking, his eyes widened—and he took off running.

I pushed through the kids to follow, catching the sound of a door slamming. I rounded the corner and found the door—just in time to see the man crouched under a stairwell, looking up at me like a trapped animal.

Man: “Please! I didn’t do that!”

He sobbed.

Man: “I already told you all—I didn’t!”

Me: “What are you talking about? Who are you?”

Man: “I already told the last officer—I didn’t mess with that girl!”

He was wiping snot and tears off his face.

Me: “What’s your name?”

Man: “Danny. I’m Danny. I work here. They pay me. They really do.”

Me: “Okay, Danny. Why did you run?”

Danny: “I saw you at Ms. Carmen’s house. I thought you were here to get me... for hiding from you.”

Me: “What girl are you talking about?”

Danny: “The girl with the yellow shoes. I didn’t mean to do anything wrong. I told the man—he wasn’t supposed to be in the school.”

Me: “What man?”

Danny: “Don’t know him. I already told you all. The girl went with him. It was late. I sleep here sometimes—I know I’m not supposed to—but it don’t hurt nobody.”

Me: “That’s okay. What happened?”

Danny: “Ms. Carmen came in that night. Real fast. Grabbed something from the library. Slammed the door so hard, it woke me up.”

Me: “What did she grab?”

Danny: “Don’t know. I laid back down. She’s always good.”

Me: “Then what?”

Danny: “I couldn’t sleep. So I got up and walked outside. I saw the girl. Yellow shoes. She was running, and a man was chasing her. Real mad. Yelling.”

Danny shut his eyes hard.

Danny: “I walked back into the school. I was scared. She ran in after me. Then he got her. Picked her up. Saw me. Told me his daughter had been bad. I told him he can’t be in the school at night. Then they left.”

Tears leaked out from his shut eyes.

Danny: “She kept yelling, ‘Help, Danny. Help Danny.’”

He opened his eyes again and looked at me.

Me: “Thank you for talking to me.”

Danny: “Sir, tell Ms. Carmen I still ain’t seen her dog.”
