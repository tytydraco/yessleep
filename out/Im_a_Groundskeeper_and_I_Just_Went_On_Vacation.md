My name is Mark and I am a 30 year old groundskeeper. I work for the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in - believe it or not - Hollywood, California. My title is actually technically the on-site lead horticulturist but no one ever calls me that. With such a large cemetery at my care, it is a full time job and I have a small crew for each division of the cemetery. I would love to drone on for paragraphs about the details of office locations and specific care instructions for marble tombstones vs concrete, but no one wants to read all that and if they are the small minority that do, they would've googled it by now.

My job is riddled with strange occurrences on the property. I know the word "cemetery" usually conjures images of ghosts, ghouls, and goths. However, these are not at all what actually happens. I typically do my end of the work during the night due to the insufferable heat that plagues Southern California. The sun reflecting from the nearby buildings just intensify the scalding. Nothing really happens during the day anyway save for usual funerals and the occasional earthquake repairs. At night, though, (pardon the reference) shit gets spooky. 

The first thing I noticed was very small things, stuff you'd just double-take and move on. The property's peacocks donning plumes of cartilage and bone rather than the typical feathers. Gravestones breathing. The haunting whistles of the mausoleums. This stuff was, albeit, concerning in my 5-9 day-to-day life, but ignorable at the metaphorical end of the day. 

The things I couldn't quite ignore began to happen about 4 years into the job.

One night, I was doing the typical red tape bullshit of reports and paperwork in my office when I got a text from one of my crews. A woman who had been visiting a gravesite wasn't leaving and they needed to clear out the dead foliage. Throwing away the flowers on the grave of a loved one always seems cruel, but necessary. We make sure the flowers we dispose of are used as fertilizer and compost to give the plants around the property extra nutrients. That way it doesn't just go to rot but also is given back to the earth. 

I made my way over to the plot they were waiting at to see what I assumed was a woman in a long black garment. The black fabric bled into the grass in waves pushed by the unseen night wind. Her figure obscured by the fine lace adorning her head, woven with her hair as a mourning veil. The site was old. The gravestone decorated with bundles upon bundles of dried flowers of an unknown type. Had this been the day time, we would have left a grieving woman alone, but the cemetery closes at sunset and I don't like getting trespassing charges thrown around. 

"Ma'am," I politely whispered, "I'm gonna need you to go ahead and head on home. We'll be back open tomorrow morning. If you need someone to talk to or somewhere to go I have plenty of -" and then I was on the ground gulping in air as if I had been drowning at sea. 

I hacked and coughed while taking in my surroundings, startled by this teleportation that just occurred. I was now on the cold marble floor of one of the mausoleums. The grave I had been just standing at was about 300 feet away and now, as I got up and looked in that direction, free of figures or flowers. It was a clean, overgrown plot surrounded by hundreds of the same. 

I went back to my office. 

Last night, which was the inciting incident to try and document everything, was even more harrowing. I was stretching my legs after a few hours straight of sitting on my laptop and typing. I usually go for a quick lap around the path through and breath the midnight air before returning to my cramped office. I was walking by some of the typical gaudy, ornate, single-occupant mausoleums that are common in this particular cemetery. But then I noticed a new one. I knew it had to be new because of the years on the job made me privy to pretty much all the major gravesites. Did I know every name on every generic headstone? Obviously not. Did I know the gravestone with the massive 7ft tall angel watching over it? Obviously so. The information just kinda makes it's way into your brain over time. 

This site was not just any, either, it was a lone mausoleum on it's own private island in the middle of a large water fixture. Completely isolated from the surrounding sites. Those fuckers work fast to put a whole lake in, I thought to myself as I crossed the land bridge leading to the front gate. I found it slightly open and no lock in site. I wasn't too worried at first, as goth kids who are willing to hang out in a dead person's concrete house usually can lockpick, too. I creaked open the door and stepped inside to make sure any occupants had exited while making a mental note to grab a spare MasterLock from my office. As I stepped into the echoic chamber, the large iron gate swung and slammed shut behind me. I jumped at the noise and caught my breath back up in my chest. 

The door wouldn't open. It was not just locked. It was cemented into the walls of the crypt. Now I began to panic. 

I rattled, shooked, shaked, pryed, prayed, and everything in between trying to get that gate open. Wouldn't even rattle against my weight. I began to yell out between the bars for any of my guys that may be working nearby. No response. I dug in my pockets for my phone, but I had idiotically left it on the charger back in my office. Best case scenario: I was trapped until one of my crews passed by. Worst case scenario: I was trapped until the cemetery opened in the morning. As much as I would've hated the latter option, it was a breath of relief that I knew eventually someone would help me out. A body can last 3 days without water, and I only had to wait about 3 hours. 

There is no word in the dictionary I could find to accurately describe the mixture of dread, fear, and panic I felt when I checked again and 5 hours had passed with no dawn approaching. It was 8am in the middle of summer, it should be broad daylight and there should be visitors and tourists flooding this place. Hour 7 and I began to hear whispering. When I first heard it, I looked to the wall where typically the bodies would've been laid inside of the wall. I instead was met with blank tiling and marble of an intricate design cascading to the side walls. It was geometric patterns that interlocked and created the illusion of depth like one of those graffiti optical illusions where when you stand in one spot it looks like the word "Attachment" or whatever. 

Hour 12 and the voices were now yelling but whispering at the same time. The droning noise felt as it was being directly played inside of my molars and vibrating through my skull. I thought I was dying. 

2 days passed and I felt the hands. Crawling inside of my skin. Through my veins. I was alone, but so disastrously crowded. 

3 days in and the hands began to pull. They pulled my jaw out of socket and gouged my eyes trying to pull me into the floor as a lay, praying for death. My muscles felt fatigued from dehydration and malnutrition and my voice was hoarse from screaming. I couldn't tell if my pain would've been more or less had I been at my physical best. Instead I just felt the dull ache of my joints being bent and my skin tearing off my flesh as more hands began to pull into me. As my consciousness began to blissfully fade into oblivion, my sentience taken away from this mortal coil, I sat up in the grass.  

I was outside of the crypt I had just been in. Except, there was no crypt. There was no water fixture. There was nothing but a few bushes separating the neighboring gravesites. I checked my watch and I had been sitting in the grass for 3 minutes. 

I immediately drove home and let my crews know to text me if they needed anything. This morning, I called the property manager and requested to use all of my PTO effective immediately for a "mental health leave of absence." The crews were told to text in case of emergences and to go to their crew leads for assignments until my return. I plan on going back just to pay the bills, but sequester myself in my office in hopes of this being simply a psychotic break that will go away with some vacation time alone. My gut tells me, though, that I'm a fucking idiot for thinking that for a second.
