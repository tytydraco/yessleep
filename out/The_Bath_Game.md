 I have always shared a deep interest for urban legends since I was young, however more particularly for Japanese Urban legends. Growing up on the internet, my first years of using it consisted of ‘Top 10 of the creepiest urban legends’ and ‘Don’t do (insert Japanese ritual) at 3AM!’. It was silly but at the time those videos genuinely terrified me and looking past the dramatic editing I do see why. Ghost stories were scary but the uncanniness of seeing someone you don’t know in a place they shouldn’t be was somehow worse. The mystery of seeing a woman with dull light skin staring back at you through a gap as her long,  tangled hair laid on her shoulders as you're in a public bathroom stall was enough to make me avert my eyes to any corner of my room when the lights were off. Logistics didn’t need to matter when it came to these stories, the premise could be ridiculous as long as the rules remained consistent. But the only reason why I understand now is because of what unforgiving forces I have introduced into my life, and I’m afraid I’ve made a grave mistake. I’ve been playing the Bath Game for over a month now. A game that should have ended in less than 24 hours I have outstretched to make my chances of winning close to nothing. Please, for the love of God. Don’t play this game. 

I’m sure that all families have some sort of issue that keeps things a bit separated. Whether that’d be divorce or unresolved disputes, there always seems like there’s a severed member that ‘we don’t talk about’. For the most part, my family ignored or at least came close to ignoring all of the underlying problematic issues each other had and continued to visit often. This was of course once all of the cousins started to grow up, introducing a new generation of toddlers. My considerably large family tree had all departed in their own ways as they prioritized their personal lives. That was until this most recent Easter Sunday, where we all got into our Sunday’s best and stacked my household inside my mom’s Toyota Corolla. My grandparent’s house was 30 minutes away from where we had lived, so it gave me a good amount of time to mentally prepare myself for however long we’d be surrounded by bragging competitions about which cousin is excelling the most and wine stained gossip. All I can say is I was not upset when Aunt Khloe became ‘busy with work’ as she posted her weekend trips with her new boyfriend. 

As much as I drowned out the tenseness I felt, it would soon come flooding back once I recognized the small white building with a cross displayed on the top. I slipped off my headphones, allowing them to rest on my neck before flicking the power button off. My mom had pulled through one of the spaces available due to the dirt not indicating any direct parking organizations. She had turned the car off, placing the keys in her pocket as she turned to look at me and my brother who was in the front seat. 

“You guys ready to get your church on?” She chuckled at her own joke, despite how embarrassing her perkiness was it honestly made me smile. 

“Ready as I’ll ever be. If anyone really needs their soul saved it’s Aunt Khloe.” My brother replied, flicking the sun visor down and fixing his hair. This was shortly met by a firm slap on his shoulder by my mom.

“Hey!” She scolded him, but it didn’t do much considering how he just laughed in return. “Both of you need to save the snarkiness for when we go home. This really means a lot to Mimi.”

The two of us agreed before we all left the car and approached the decrepit building. Opening the doors, the overwhelming humidity assaulted the three of us as a heatwave of human moisture was introduced. My mom had been in the front of our small party, searching for any sign of our relatives. Luckily it wasn’t too long before my Mimi had excitedly stood up from her chair bumping her wide hips into my Pepaw. The three of us had approached closer to the big group, making it easier to see all of my relatives. Shuffling our way through the seats, my grandmother’s outstretched hands entrapped me into a tight squeeze of a hug. 

“Ah! My sweet Daniella! You’ve grown up into such a beautiful young lady.” Her large chest had smothered my nose in a scent of Lilac and hand wipes. She pulled away, holding my hands as she looked into my eyes. Her eyes trailed down lower on my face and I saw as her eyebrows furrowed. “What’s this?” Her soft yet aged hands had reached for my nose, intrusively tapping my piercing. 

“Oh, it’s just my nose piercing.” I shrugged, pursing my lips before shifting my weight awkwardly. Her face contorted into a form of skepticism, making me feel on the chopping block of approval. 

“You know, I’ve always thought those face piercings were tacky but you make anything beautiful.” She chirped, but I could always sense when she was disingenuous. After a series of awkward hugs and kisses on the forehead, the sermon had officially started. Nothing noteworthy, it was the same as it usually was considering my early years were going to this church regularly since I lived with my Mimi and Pepaw shortly after my parents divorce. Damien, my brother had only been two years old and my dad’s portion of the pay was unreciprocated. There really wasn’t much choice other than accept the help from my grandparents. Everything had turned out just fine once my mom was able to get some of her footing and save up some money on her own but that was the main reason why this rural area brought sentimental feelings for me. The lengthy sermon had eventually ended, prompting all of the people to pile near the door just before their legs were able to get used to walking again. As we stepped outside into the golden hour breeze, we all slowly migrated into our own groups of mundane conversations before we all drove to the dinner reservations. Before I could successfully slip away from the group, my back directly bumped into the famed Aunt Khloe. 

Her black long locks had curled in straight wisps, something that I only ever saw early 90s models have. The cheetah print tank she had worn was quite revealing for something you’d wear to church, something that I know the rest of my family members were silently judging her for. That as well as the tight leather pants that I personally applauded people wearing. Her gaze turned into a preppy smile before stretching her hands out. 

“Ah Princess Daniella, hello!” She reached for my head and planted a firm kiss onto my forehead before pushing my bangs out of my face. “I can barely even see you with your hair! Haha!” After the short lived conversation, we moved onto the topic of my cousin, Iris,  who would be meeting us at our dinner reservations. We were incredibly close when I was young, she always visited my grandparents when we still lived there. She was the key reason that I was interested in the early days of internet horror. It was common to pile around my Mimi’s old home computer and search up classic online relics like “There is nothing” or “I feel amazing” every weekend and go to sleep curling up in the covers fearfully. It’s pretty odd how childhood memories live up to their situations. My best memories came from the worst time in my family’s life, the times where we struggled the most. Finishing up my conversation with my aunt, I felt a slight sense of that childlike wonder of seeing my cousin again. A remnant of the excitement for another sleepover.

After retiring to our designated vehicles, we followed one another to the nearest Texas Roadhouse. Entering the building was a stark difference from the church with a more pleasant smell. The server had taken our substantial entourage through a maze of booth seats packed with a variety of families ranging from smaller to larger quantities. It was towards one of the back corners that I had seen my cousin sit down and scooch towards the end corner of the booth seats. She looked a lot different this time around, it took a little more than just a moment to recognize. Her auburn locks had now been cut and dyed a jet black, her chestnut eyes had been shaded with vibrant eyeshadow. Eager to sit alongside her, I was quick to slide my way into the booth seat across the table in front of her. 

“Hey.” I greeted her quietly, taking her attention off her phone. “What’s up?” 

Her face remained neutral, her bored eyes looking back at me. “Nothin’ much.” Her short response had quickly killed the conversation as she returned back to her phone, leaving me to awkwardly pick up my menu and skim the different options. The booth was filled with boisterous conversations and different family members restraining their kids from running around the aisles. I skimmed through the options before glancing up at her again.

“I like your shirt by the way.” 

Tearing herself away from the phone, she looked at it as if she was checking my statement. Along with her jet black hair, it was a darker shirt but a poster for a movie called ‘House’. “Oh, thanks. You’ve seen it?

“Oh yeah! It’s a classic.” 

I could see her perk up in her seat, leaning forward to rest her elbows on the table. “No way! I just assumed that no one had seen it.”

“It’s probably in between that or Pulse that’s my favorite.” I mirrored her movements as well, curling my feet on my seat, pushing my knees up to my chest. 

It was the first time that I had seen her smile all night. I was transported to all of the late nights sneaking downstairs to the living room and booting up the computer. The paranoia of the creaky floors giving our position away to whatever ghoul could be watching. Our shared love for Japanese horror was the catalyst for several different topics as well. We talked about other concepts we thought were scary but more importantly the interest we had for urban legends. Time had passed and things were much more lively. We laughed over our food, filling us up by the minute while dipping the thick fries into the melted gold that was the sauces.

“Remember those sleepover games we’d play?” Iris muffled her words while she stuffed her face in the half eaten burger. 

“Oh, like Bloody Mary or the midnight one?” I sipped my drink while she nodded her head affirming my statement. “Yeah I remember we’d be so scared to even try but it never worked.”

“That’s the thing.” She put her finger up, swallowing her food before placing the burger down. “I found one that does.”

I furrowed my brows after letting out a chuckle. I know we both kept our love for Japanese horror media but I didn’t think about whether or not she was still participating in childish urban legend games. 

“I’m serious. I did it like what…A couple months ago?”

I chuckled a little and said, “Pfft-Okay Iris. What is it then?”

*“ The Bath Game: Daruma-san fell down.”*

I was vaguely familiar with the name. Daruma dolls were a sign of good luck and fortune in Japan, but Daruma-san was a different story. She further explained the ‘rules’ of the game, the next best thing to compare it to is a game of red light green light. The legend consisted of a woman who fell in a bathtub. Her face smacked against the faucet, smashing it against one of her eyes. In an act of vengeance, she follows and tries to catch whoever participates in the game. Remaining in close proximity to the person who is ‘it’ until they are caught. Iris told me how surreal it was seeing this woman follow her through her peripheral vision but disappearing once she turned to see. 

“I’m telling you it was fucking terrifying, try it.” 

“What?”

“Try it, it won’t last longer than a day.” She leaned in closer, a coy smile on her face.

*“Or are you scared?”*

And that was honestly enough for me to try it out. At that time I honestly didn’t believe the vividness of an apparition of a woman was enough to take at face value, so there was nothing much to lose in my mind. 

If only I knew what I know now.

Iris had texted me all of the directions to the game and I did as follows:

* Fill up the bathtub
* Turn out all of the lights
* Sit in the tub facing the faucet and wash your hair while repeating “Daruma-san fell down” with your eyes closed. 
* Picture a woman in a bathtub falling, hitting her head against the faucet as you do so
* Once you sense movement or hear a sound behind you, don’t turn around or open your eyes. Ask out loud, “Why did you fall?” 
* After letting the question settle in the air, leave the room without draining the bathtub or opening your eyes. 

Out of boredom, I figured I’d try out the ritual to get me in a more ‘spooked’ mood. I doubted anything would come out of it so I filled up the bathtub. The steam of the bath began to rise as I took off my clothes, allowing each article to fall in an unorganized pile on the floor. Feeling a sense of wanting to back out when I saw the tub, I reached for the light switch. The sudden change in visibility had abruptly filled my eyes as I felt around for any sign of assistance for getting into the water. Despite the lukewarm water submerging my lower half,  I could feel my skin pucker in thousands of goosebumps. My vision remained dark, as well as my eyes keeping closed. I began to blindly cup the water in front before pouring it onto my head. 

With the first fall of water on my face I muttered, “Daruma-san fell down.” The statement echoed into the vacant room, only allowing the trickling water to be heard. Hearing this said for the first time, I held my tongue, a major part of me didn’t want to continue with the chant. I felt like a scared deer, frozen in its position in front of headlights.  Without much choice, I continued. *“Daruma-san fell down.”* I could hear my voice shake as the water from my hands pooled onto my head, allowing my wet hair to stick to my back, tickling my spine. The coldness of the dark had remained just beyond my closed eyes, submerging it into an unforgiving void. I was stuck in a robotic repetition of chanting and washing my hair and after a while I didn’t feel so afraid anymore. I didn’t feel anything at that moment, as if my senses were drifting away. Initially it would be obviously my sight due to the darkness, however it would soon turn to my taste, and when I got deeper in the routine, my sense of hearing and touch. 

*“Daruma-san fell down”*

After the endless cycle of raising my hands and allowing the water to fall while stripping away any sense of being, I stood up. My legs shook and struggled to support my weight on the slick floor of the tub. A period of time had passed once doing so, just standing in the bathtub. It was a claustrophobic feeling of stillness. The only thing my body was able to do was sway ever so slightly back and forth as my balance didn’t allow for complete stillness. It was only then that the dripping of the water had silenced itself, allowing a deafening lull in the room. The breeze on my bare skin caused the hairs to prickle. I was finally able to move ever so slightly, my torso leaned towards the left, letting my spine curl slightly. 

*Swish*

The water behind hushfully splashed, the flow of it grazing the back of my calves. I felt a slight hitch of air brushing against the back of my neck followed by a swat-like sound of skin, almost as if someone was trying to cover their mouth. I straightened my posture swiftly, stiffening my body like a turtle returning back to its shell. This was followed by another sound of water moving. I leaned my torso towards the right, curling my spine to mirror how it originally was.

 There was another splash of water.

“Why did you fall?” My lungs pushed out the question, nearing a quiet whisper.

My senses had finally caught up to my situation, I felt like I was drowning and finally got back up to the surface to gasp for air. I could feel my face tingle and heat up as I felt *it* behind.

Forcing my eyes to continue to be shut, I placed my hand on the shower curtain and lightly hauled my leg above the ledge of the tub. The dripping water from my feet splattered onto the hard floor as I continued to blindly maneuver my way through the bathroom. I remember hearing the thing behind me following suit, copying my every move. It appeared to be much closer than it was in the tub, I felt its tangled hair caressing my dampened shoulders, causing it to stick. I took another step forward, letting go of the security that was the shower curtain. Shortly after the sound of my skin smacking against the floor, an echoed one had copied shortly behind. Its hair that was laying on my shoulders behind rose above my head, almost as if it was forced to hunch itself over in the bathtub. 

In an act of desperation, I fought against my declining balance. Holding my hands in front as I braved two extra steps in front, squeezing my eyes closed. I continued to rush myself towards the door, harshly hitting it with my body. The revelation had  prompted me to desperately fish for the doorknob, each attempt failed as I continued to hear wet slaps of flesh on the floor.

*Slap*

*Slap*

*SLAP SLAP SLAP*

 I couldn’t help but imagine how it looked, how its black cold locks mirrored mine but much more tangled and matted, how tall its limbs were that only allowed it to hunch and squat in any normal sized room, I could imagine its absent eye with red flesh peeking from the outside. The more I thought about it, the closer it became, and the more I failed to find the door handle. 

I continued to bash my knuckles against the door, rubbing my wet palms on the surface. The door shook and rocked in between the gaps of the door hinges. My breathing had quickened as I was desperate to open my eyes, to see the vague light coming from under the door so I could find the glow of the bronze door handle. From behind I could hear a lethargic groan. A low growl right near my ear. Long and pained, I could feel the moisture and warm heat of its breath graze my earlobe. 

With a final gasp, I could feel my hand slap against a rounded hard object. With nothing left to do other than ignore the aching on my hand, I swung the door open before shortly closing the door behind after I left the room. 

Slowly opening my eyes, the moonlight from the window had nearly blinded me. I raised one hand to obscure the violating light while allowing my eyes to adjust. Shortly after gaining a full view of my room, the fearful thought of seeing whatever was following me caused me to frantically look around but it wasn’t there. With a deep breath I allowed my head to rest against the door, sliding my back against it while landing onto the floor to sit down. This is when the game had officially started.
