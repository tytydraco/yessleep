  
It was a dull autumn evening in the small American town of Millville when I decided to explore the abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. The mansion had been uninhabited for decades and had an eerie aura surrounding it. Rumor had it that it was haunted and I was intrigued by the idea of checking out that story. It was 10pm when I grabbed my flashlight, a camera and my courage and set off.  
The moon hung pale in the sky when I reached the mansion. It towered majestically above the surrounding trees and exuded an air of morbid splendor. The building had suffered years of disrepair and the windows were broken, giving the property a gloomy appearance.  
I entered the mansion and was greeted by a wave of icy cold that seemed to sink into my bones. My flashlight cut through the darkness as I carefully searched each room. Dusty furniture, torn curtains and broken mirrors spoke of past splendor and the decay of time.  
In one of the rooms I came across a dusty diary lying on a dilapidated desk. The pages were yellowed and the handwriting was barely decipherable. But I was able to decipher some passages. It was about a family that once lived in this mansion but was struck by a cruel curse. The author of the diary was desperate and wrote of inexplicable occurrences and mysterious shadows that haunted the property.  
The deeper I delved into the story, the more I felt the atmosphere in the room change. A quiet whisper seemed to hang in the air, so quiet that at first I thought it was my imagination. But then I heard it again - a whispering murmur that seemed to come from the shadows of the room.  
My flashlight shook in my hand as I focused on the whispering. It was as if someone knew my thoughts and was sending me messages. "Leave this place," whispered a voice, gentle yet threatening. A shiver ran down my spine as I searched the room for the source of this eerie song.  
Suddenly the darkness seemed to become thicker and I saw shadowy figures dancing in the shadows. Their faces were unrecognizable, but their presence was unmistakable. My heart raced as I stared into the darkness, unable to tear myself away from this inexplicable spectacle.  
Determined to discover the secret of the mansion, I continued my exploration, accompanied by the voices that continued to whisper. The rooms seemed to change, the walls grew closer, as if the building itself seemed to be alive. Every step I took echoed heavy and ominous.  
On one of the upper floors I came across a room filled with old books and medical equipment. I searched the dusty shelves and came across an old photo album. When I opened it, I saw pictures of patients who were once treated in this mansion. Their faces were marked with sickness and despair, and I could almost feel the fear in their eyes.  
Suddenly I heard footsteps behind me. I spun around, but no one was there. The whispering voices grew louder, shadows seemed to dance around me, and invisible eyes seemed to be watching me. "You should never have come here," a voice whispered in my ear. My throat tightened
