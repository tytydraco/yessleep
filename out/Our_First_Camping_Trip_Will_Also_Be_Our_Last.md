Christi, I don’t know how to start this letter except to tell you the awful truth. Our sons are dead. 

I am sitting here alone in the mountain cabin you rented for us, drenched in blood. My hand is shaky and I feel pain in my soul. 

Our children died by my hand, I have to admit this to you. 
And once you read this letter fully, you will understand why I had no choice. 

Someday, you may even find it in your heart to forgive me. But I’m not asking for that right now. 

Instead I want you to please read this with an open mind. I know that what I will tell you is going to seem unbelievable. But I swear on my life… on my soul, this is precisely what happened. 

It may be my last chance to get the facts straight so I beg of you to read it all the way through and then come to your own conclusions. 

If not for me then for the three amazing boys we raised together. 

This is their last testament as well. 

_______

It made my heart flutter with excitement when you surprised me on my birthday with a weekend getaway to your dads old cabin. We haven’t been there since he passed and there’s been an ache in my bones to go up to the mountains. Plus the boys had never been at all. 

The boys have been antsy as well, either due to school or just the stress of life. They had heard about it the last trip but never had really experienced the mountains like we had. And of course, you knew we all needed a break. 

The most disappointing thing was when I found out you wouldn’t be able to join us. Your mom wanted us to have a boy’s trip, enjoy the outdoors unfettered. I knew she also wanted to use the time to be with you. Her health hasn’t improved much since Christmas and I could tell from your phone calls that life changing discussions would be happening soon. 

I didn’t press the issue or show that I was going to miss you. Instead I kissed your cheek, squeezed your hand and promised I would enjoy myself. 

Even if that was only half true, I made a promise also to myself that I would give it my best. 

It was easy for my attitude to change when I saw our boys packing. 
All of them have taken after me with their love of the woods, especially Garret. Last year we bought him a crossbow and he was especially interested in taking it with us and trying it out on a few hawks. 

I brought some gear as well because I figured this would give me a chance to teach Luke how to fire a gun for the first time in his life. The boy is eight and honestly we let his older brothers do this stuff when they were six. Maybe it’s because he is the baby and we are too protective, but I was determined to make this trip special for him. 

Colt was the only one who didn’t seem to have that same enthusiasm about the trip. My guess at the time was that some girl had him wrapped around her finger and he wasn’t keen on being away in the hills without a way to keep in contact. 

In the past before your dad died the cabin was hooked up with wifi and all the modern amenities, but from what I gathered now your mom only kept the bare minimum amount of maintenance on the place.

This trip felt like we were saying goodbye to a lot of things, if I’m being honest, so that made my resolve to enjoy it even firmer. 

With fishing gear, hunting knives, bows, and other luggage all loaded in the Tahoe we were ready to go that Thursday night. Thanks to a school holiday we had three days to enjoy and get lost out in the woods and weather said it would be clear all the way. It would be a five hour drive and we would drop you off at your moms house and be at the cabin around noon on Friday. 

Garret wanted to leave that same night and hardly slept a wink. He was asking questions about trails, fishing spots, and even found a few caves he wanted to go explore. 

Even Colt was finally coming around to the idea of it thanks to that attitude. 

I think the last thing I told you before I waved goodbye at your moms was that I would call you when I got there. 

Of course I entirely forgot that cell phones don’t work here, it was just a force of habit and we laughed. You felt confident that our children would be safe with me and you would see us again on Monday morning. 
A short trip but we were going to make the most of it. By now any blues I had were long gone and for the remainder of the trip I played I spy with Luke. Garret was half asleep and Colt listened to tunes as we got further up the mountains. 

Leaving the world behind without a care. 

At the final rest stop where I had a signal I checked to be sure you hadn’t  messaged me. I was almost about to let you know we were near our destination but decided to not bother you. 

Then we drove another forty five minutes and made it to the cabin. 

There isn’t another structure for miles. Your dad owned so much land up here with his logging business and most of the forest is still untouched. 

We did see a few of the trucks about five miles down the south pass but nothing that would interrupt the untamed beauty of the mountaintop. 

Luke ran up toward the overlook on the east side of the cabin and hollered excitedly toward the valley below. It echoed for miles. 

The cabin itself is just like we left it, frozen in time I suppose. A massive den opens in the front with your dad’s hunting trophies on the back wall. Garret asked me if that old blunderbuss your dad kept actually fired. I told him I would hate to find out. 

A kitchen to the left along with downstairs bathroom and game room and an office. I told the boys to take their stuff upstairs as I pulled off some of the drapes from the furniture. 

No one has bothered any of this stuff since we were last here so it was rather dusty, but the rustic feel of the cabin was very inviting. The large back patio with sliding glass doors looks toward the east valley as well, it’s right above the basement stairs where the laundry and freezer and generator are at and it’s also a perfect place to sit and drink an ice cold beer. 

I have to admit I wish I had brought some. Looking toward the miles of forest, I felt lonely and exhilarated all in the same moment. The woods were so quiet, almost haunting. I wondered if during the time we spent here we would even find anything worth hunting for. 

Luke was first on the patio, checking out the old binoculars that were still sitting on the deck and scanning the forest for any signs of life. The forest did seem unusually still though. 

He asked me if we could go bird spotting later in the day and I said we would. 

Then I told him to get his brothers and help me with the fishing gear. The plan was to go to the old pond and fetch our dinner, like real wilderness explorers. 

The boys met me at the Tahoe and I frowned as I saw Colt still wasting time on his cellphone, despite the fact that there wasn’t good signal here he was waving it around in the air hoping for one last chance to shoot a text. 

I tossed the phone in the back of the Tahoe and ordered him to lug the lure box, leading all of them down a western path that zigzagged to the pond where your dad fished all the time. 

For the rest of the afternoon we lazily sat on the pier in lawn chairs and cast our lines. Colt brought a radio but instead of catching any tunes it was just weather reports. A meteor shower was expected for the night. Luke asked if we could stay up to watch it. 
It was just a relaxing day. 

I remember thinking that this was the sort of escape I needed. 

But it wasn’t meant to last. 

After catching a few trout, I told the boys to head inside and shower while I went to the basement to gut the fish. 

We were going to eat our small catch and then probably watch one of the VHS tapes that your dad collected. 

The evening wore down without a hitch, and I found myself just barely able to stay awake as all of us piled on the couch to watch a classic B movie. Something about an invasion. 

Somewhere in the middle of the black and white film, I drifted off and the boys were just as dead tired too. 

I wish I could say I had good dreams that night. But the smell of burnt popcorn is the last decent memory I have. 

Somewhere along in the night, all of us were awakened by the loudest crash. 

Garret jumped up first and I fumbled to find the lights. All of us were staring out the back door where we saw a distinct trail of ash flowing up from the edge of the valley. 

A few moments later, the power in the cabin went out and I guessed whatever had happened out in the woods was affecting the generator. The boys wanted to go investigate. 

I told them to stay put until I found a working flashlight, but every device I tried in the cabin was suddenly drained of power. That didn’t sit right with me, and it made my curiosity intensify as I told the boys to stay close and follow me toward the impact site. 

The air seemed unusually still that night, not even the crickets were stirring. And it occurred to me that we had not seen a single sign of animal life since arriving at the cabin. Did they somehow know about this beforehand? I knew that instinct could easily have driven them away. 

And I was getting a feeling in my stomach that maybe we should leave too. 

A few miles down an old trail, we found the crater. Luke excitedly hollered at the strange smoke in the area while I focused on the deep hole made in the earth. 

Whatever had crashed had gone down quickly. But it was too far down to make heads or tails of what it might be. 

I urged the boys to stay away from the edge as I tried to see if there was a different way to get down there and have a better look. 

Maybe it was a sixth sense that overtook me but after several minutes of standing there staring at the hole, I got ahold of myself and told the boys we should all head inside. 

I promised we would come back in the morning and try to get a sample of whatever had crashed, but honestly I just wanted to get out of there. 

Whatever was in that hole… it did not feel friendly in the slightest. 

They objected a little but it was too dark for them to argue, especially when I pointed out the noise would attract predators. Colt tried to say that there wasn’t a bear for miles but I gave him the stink eye and he shut his mouth. 

Back in the cabin, I told them all to get to bed. Once I was sure they were in their rooms, I went out to the patio and looked toward the crater again. 

The hairs on the back of my neck were standing up as I heard this faint noise. I couldn’t be sure where it was coming from, it almost felt like it was engulfing me. 

I rubbed my tired eyes and collapsed on the couch. I had no reason to think anything else would happen that night. 

But boys will be boys. 

As I slept, they concocted a plan to go down into the crater. I’m not sure whose idea it was or if it mattered, but they somehow managed to sneak past me and gathered rope and climbing equipment from the basement on the way. 

I only found out because when I woke to go to the restroom I nearly jumped from the couch. Luke was standing there keeping an eye on me as a lookout. 

As soon as he saw how angry I was he panicked and claimed it was all Garret’s idea but I didn't care. I just needed to know where they were. 

Luke nervously pointed to the crater and I rushed into the night to find his brothers. 

He was right at my heels as I shouted to his older brothers, thanking the stars they hadn’t descended into the pit when I found them. 

Colt had found a rope though and was testing it out against the trunk of a tree when I caught them red handed. 

Of course I scolded them but I was also thankful I hadn’t arrived a moment too late. 

Or so I thought. 

Luke was catching his breath near the precipice when the ground gave way under his feet. It happened in slow motion. I tried to grab him but he fell so quickly, all I could was watch and listen to his scream. 

The world felt like it was spinning as I shouted to him, trying to make sure he was okay. My heart racing even faster when he did not respond. 

I told Colt to pass me the rope. He hurriedly obeyed me and I wrapped it tight around my waist. Then I used the heavy tree as my hoist to head into the dark pit. 

I kept calling to Luke, but couldn’t see anything. The pit felt like it was a mile long and every second that I couldn’t find him felt like a lifetime. 

Finally I hit the bottom and I tried to feel around for our son. 

The ground was cool, hard and filled with indentations. Something from above had definitely crashed here and it made me nervous to realize I was standing on top of this otherworldly object. 

I also felt a crack in the middle, like an eggshell splintering. Something sticky was oozing out and I imagined the most repulsive yolk. 

Finally I touched Luke’s hand and pulled him to my chest. I also felt blood and that made me panic. I needed to get up and get him to the hospital! 

I held him against my body and pulled away from the rock as fast as I could. I still felt his heart beating slowly even though he was unconscious and that gave me hope. 

I just needed him to hang on a little longer. 

Back at the mouth of the pit, I placed Luke on the ground and got a better look at his injuries. Blood and strange black powder smeared the right side of his face. 

I’m not going to lie to you, Christi, it looked bad. 

I tossed the rope off and ordered the boys to hurry for the Tahoe. My mind was racing as I ran with our youngest in my arms. 

Sure my body was burning and pulsating with pain but I didn’t care. His life was on the line. 

My worst fears came true when we made it to the Tahoe and I realized the power in the car battery had also been drained. 

We were miles from anywhere and it was the dead of night. 

I told Colt to open the doors to the cabin and I took Luke inside, placing him on one of the couches in the den. 

I then ordered Garret get to ice from the freezer and bandages from the downstairs bathroom as Colt closed the door. He was trying his best to not cry. 

I was too if I’m being honest. And as I stared at Luke’s face I realized that black powdery substance seemed to be spreading. It was covering almost all of his head now and I shouted for them to hurry as I took his shirt off and checked for any other injuries. 

Garret and Colt stood aside as I kept trying to wake their brother, shouting his name. I didn’t know what else to do. I prayed to God that our boy not be taken from us. 

Luke suddenly took out a wide gasp and began to gag, his eyes bulging as he grabbed at his throat. That black material was now seeping into his airways. 

“Fight it! Come on! get him in the shower and get this stuff off him,” I shouted hysterically as I tried to help him up. 

But it was already too late. 

A few moments later Luke wasn’t breathing at all, his body jerking violently to whatever that black stuff was doing to him. 

Then he was very very still. 

I collapsed in a heap of tears as I grabbed at him and tried to make him come back to me. 

Garret and Colt said nothing, I honestly don’t know what they felt. 

But their brother was gone. I checked for vital signs a few more times, but it was pointless. I draped my coat over his body and stood up, trying not to lose my cool again in front of my other two sons. 

They blabbered and cried and apologized and I honestly couldn’t even begin to describe how awful I felt as I held them. I promised we would go home as soon as the power came back on. 

As we held each other there near the back door, Colt wordlessly pushed away and pointed toward Luke. 

I turned in surprise to see that our boy was sitting up, his entire body now an ashy brown color. His eye were dark red and that powder he had been covered in was now slowly falling off his body like a mist. 

The thing that infected our son screamed and began to crawl toward us, Garret and Colt fumbled over the furniture to race to the kitchen. 
I ordered them upstairs and blocked the steps. The strange undead abomination that now wore Luke’s face didn’t seem to be able to visibly find us, shambling about the den like a mad animal. 

Was it searching for food? Did it intend to harm us?

I found the answer out quickly as it shrieked and coughed up more powder, some of which burned my skin. I managed to wash it off in the kitchen sink quickly realizing this alien menace was intent on killing and subduing all of us. 

Before I had time to even think about a plan the thing was cornering me in the kitchen. I grabbed a knife to protect myself, it’s tongue spewing out of Luke’s mouth and sliding across the floor. It was such an ungodly sight. I knew our son was gone. And I had to fight to save Garret and Colt. 

I rammed the knife in the creature’s chest and then ripped it out to slash at the throat. I had no idea if it was simply using our son’s body as a host or if it had another way of survival, but I simply had to end it. 

The alien was stronger than I anticipated, grabbing me and pulling me toward the wall. It’s skin bulged as it prepared to spew more powder in my eyes. 

But instead a shriek exited its lungs as I heard the sharp thud of an arrow strike it. It lost its footing and I looked up to see Garret was holding his crossbow, preparing to fire again as the beast tossed me aside and crawled up the side of the wall to the second floor. 

Garret was not prepared for its ferocity and speed. 

I screamed and tried to draw the beast’s attention to me as I struggled to stand, but it was already too late again. 

It burst out more of the black smoke, grabbing ahold of Garret and dragging him toward the edge of the second floor railing. 

I motioned for Colt to run down the stairs as his older brother  fought for his life, tumbling down to the den floor and crashing into the coffee table. The beast was trying desperately to consume him, stretching Luke’s skin like a net over his body. 

I yanked Colt toward me and ran for the basement, desperate for a new plan as Garret begged me to help. 

I reached for the crossbow he had dropped and fired another shot, somehow this one bounced off the creature. It had hardened Luke’s skin to become like a shell. 

And I was helpless again as my second son was eaten alive, screaming for mercy. 

I plunged into the basement, slamming the door close and demanding we barricade it with anything and everything we could find. 

Colt rushed and found several old boxes of junk and a few other items, but I knew it wouldn’t be enough to do the trick. We had to find a way to escape the cabin, find help. Otherwise we will all die here, I realized. 

I couldn’t even properly mourn Garret when the creature began to bang on the basement door, trying to find us. Colt was trembling, clawing for an exit somewhere else.

We used adrenaline to push the washer aside and found an old crawl space near to the dryer. It looked like it was used to push lint out but made wide to avoid clogs. Just barely big enough for Colt to get out. 

I demanded he flee as I heard the door splinter and snap. Down the mountain. The rest stop was a few miles but if he kept running he would find it. 

He crawled away as I found bags of ice to defend myself with. The creature was nearly in the basement. 

It now took the form of our two boys combined, their arms and legs dangling like spider limbs as it raced toward me, their heads merged into a dreadful mouth as it tried to attack. 

I flinched and ran up the stairs, this time slamming the door from the other side. 

I tried to think of anything I could use to kill the thing. 

The only idea that came to my mind was fire. Despite the loss of power I knew the old propane stove worked and the fireplace could be stoked. I would have to destroy this cabin and try to make the beast burn up in the process. But time was running out. 

I hurried to turn on the valves and then scrambled in the kitchen to find some of your dad’s old cigarettes. Ironic what killed him might he the one thing that saved me I thought. 

Then I heard a noise from below like bones breaking and my heart sunk. 

From the basement stairwell an abomination lurched out. It could hardly move at all now combine with all the flesh of our three boys. Colt had returned to save me, I guessed, only to go straight into the creature's maw. 

It used their voices to taunt me, shrilling and shaking as it struggled to move toward me. 

I realized their combined size was too much for the beast to handle and seized the opportunity. 

I ran for your dad’s trophy wall and loaded his ancient blunderbuss. The thing hadn’t been fired in ages but I only needed it to work just the one time. 

The alien was almost on top of me and I pointed toward its unfathomable mouth and fired. 

I can’t even describe the explosion of guts that cascaded across the cabin. But the deed was done. 

I sit here now, having burned the corpses and made sure not a single part of the beast remains, struggling to stay alive and pen this confession. This testimony to our survival and the survival of all humankind requires you to believe me. 
I am sure the creature infected me as well and it won’t be long it will take over my mind. 

It’s evolved since it first struck. When it took Luke it was mindless. Now it sees that to survive it will need to be smart. Be silent and hide in plain sight. 

And I think it has found a way to recreate hollow shells of our boys. I keep having strange visions of them laying in their upstairs beds, covered in silk like that of a spider. Except it ebbs and flows. It breathes. The creature will hide what happened here masterfully. 

When you come here to meet me and our weekend trip is over, you will be unaware of what transpired. 

Garret, Colt, Luke and I will smile and be ready to return home. But you must not believe the smiles. I have managed to use what little sense is left within me and hide this letter in a place that I know it can’t find but you will always check. 

I grow weak. My mind is not my own. Forgive me Christi. Please make certain we do not die here in vain. 

Please stop it from spreading.
