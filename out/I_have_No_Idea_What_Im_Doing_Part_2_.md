[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cl16lb/i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing_part_1/)

I got home from Pedro’s and immediately sat down, pulled out the prosthetic leg and examined it. Up until this point my only experience with prosthetic limbs was when I’d stare down an old war vet in the grocery store, so I didn’t have much to go on whether this was an unusual case. From the knee down it was metal -  a titanium or aluminum or something - but the foot and thigh seemed to be a plastic that was wrapped in some sort of strange yellowish leather. One section of the leather had a strange marking on it. I couldn’t fully make it out, it seemed the leather had been repurposed from something else which distorted the image, it almost looked like a heart with the words, “Mommy’s Home” written across it.

The ochre leather felt strange in my hands, I could have sworn I felt it ripple as if it detested my touch. I looked everywhere on the leg for some sort of brand name or serial number but my search came up empty.

I turned to the internet. I googled, Binged and Asked Jeeves, but still no luck. I probably spent 2 hours looking at pictures of prosthetic limbs, as if my search history wasn’t weird enough.

I sat at my kitchen table with the leg laying on the table in front of me, staring off into space thinking about what my next move would be. Should I even pursue this further? As far as I knew, I had taken care of the problem at Pedro’s and all was right in the world.

That reminded me, I checked my PayPal balance – Pedro had paid up. That’s good.

Reinvigorated by my payday I walked over to the fridge and began pouring myself a glass of water. I nearly dropped the glass when I heard a Snap! behind me. I spun around to see the leg, still on the kitchen table, only now it was standing – balancing perfectly on its single foot.

A wave of goosebumps washed over my body. I put down the glass of water and rushed to the table. I picked up the leg and stored it in the gun safe that I kept in my bedroom closet. Once I had locked the leg up, I sat on my bed and thought about how screwed I was. I mean, what the hell was I going to do? I’d been faking all of my knowledge about this stuff for years. The internet couldn’t tell me anything about this book. The only person who had any knowledge about this whatsoever was Pedro!

Then I remembered that as of that morning, Pedro was technically my employee. I gave him a call.

I’ll sum up the call I had with Pedro in one sentence: The only question to which he didn’t reply ‘I don’t know” was ‘Please don’t tell me you’ve forgotten my name already, Pedro?”

I spent the next 15 minutes talking myself off of a ledge. I must have been tricked or drugged somehow. You know what, even if everything I’d experienced that day was 100% real, what are the chances I’d encounter that entity again? Surely, it was all over. A once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing. It’s not like you hear about ghost sightings on the news or anything like that. The leg was safely locked in my gun safe, in the next few days I’d find a way to dispose of it somehow. Until then, I was going to continue with my life as normal.

That night, something woke me from sleep. I laid still in the darkness and wondered what had pulled me from sleep so quickly. A dream I couldn’t remember? A noise? It would have had to have been loud to wake me so suddenly. Maybe I’d farted myself awake? It wouldn’t have been the first time.

Just when I decided it was probably nothing, I heard a noise– footsteps in my living room. I listened as they walked slowly across my creaking hardwood floors and came to a stop just outside of my bedroom door.

Everyone talks about how they'd easily be able to fend off a home invader, but you don’t know how to react until you’re in the situation. What did I do? I froze. I wanted to shout, to jump out of bed and turn the lights on, but I found myself unable to move. I couldn’t make a sound.

Paralyzed, I watched my doorknob slowly turn then release as my door pushed open, its hinges giving their trademark whine.

My heart pounded in my chest as I watched a man-shaped shadow crawl slowly on all fours into my bedroom. It crossed the threshold of the door and stopped. The shadow’s head slowly oscillated back and forth as the creature washed its gaze across the room, it was looking for something. I could hear its raspy breathing.

Synapses and neurons deep within my brain melted under stress and the flood of adrenaline. Try as I might to cry out or run I still couldn’t. I could barely form a coherent thought outside of “Danger!”

The creature advanced. Quietly, it scurried across my bedroom floor like a giant spider, only stopping feet away from me when it came across a splash of moon light that cut the room in half through my bedroom window. The shadow seemed hesitant to cross this barrier, but after a moment, it seemed to steel its courage and continue forward.

A pale hand with long, bony fingers was the first to cross into the illuminated shaft of moonbeam. I could hear the long, dirty fingernails clack against the hardwood floors as it landed.

A forearm followed the hand, pale and scabbed.

The creature’s face followed next. Ashen and gaunt. Scabbed and pockmarked flesh stretched across protruding cheekbones that marked a starvation diet. Dark eyes reflected the moonlight back towards me from deep sunken sockets. Stringy, unwashed and matted hair flowed down to the creature’s shoulders.

I recognized the face immediately and my fear melted away.

“George, get the hell out of my house.” I said quietly, testing out my vocal cords that had been paralyzed just a few seconds ago..

“Huh?” the creature said, pretending not to hear.

“George!” I shouted getting out of bed, “Get the hell out of my house before I call the police! This is ridiculous, we have to have this talk again.”

I flipped on the bedside lamp and George hissed and covered his eyes like a vampire in sunlight. He wasn’t a vampire, he was a crackhead that lived in the abandoned house next door to mine and this wasn’t the first time he’d broken into my house.

The reason he was coming into my bedroom now, was because he’d already stolen the TV in my living room and he knew I had one in my bedroom as well. I’d caught him a few times sitting outside my bedroom window watching whatever I happened to have on.

The funny thing is I had tons of other valuables he could have easily stolen – watches, cash, laptops, gaming consoles, power tools, I even kept my bike just sitting on my front porch – he was just obsessed with stealing TVs for some reason.

“George, get the hell out of my house before I Hulk-out on your ass!” I shouted, grabbing him by the forearm and pulling him to his feet. “I’ve been nice to you, haven’t I? I didn’t make a big deal out of the TV you stole from me. I don’t call the police on you when you and your gross little friends howl at the moon when you're cracked out at 3am. I even gave you all that string cheese last week, remember how much you liked that string cheese?”

“Yeah,” George said weakly. He tried his best to give me puppy-dog eyes but that’s nearly impossible to do under the influence of crack, so he ended up just staring at me with massive crazy eyes, like a squirrel who had just drank a gallon of espresso.

“Ok, so why are you still messing with me?” I was pissed, “What happened to the lemonade stand I thought you were going to open? What happened to being an honest businessman?”

“I’m sorry” George mumbled, “No one wanted to buy lemonade from me.”

He had a point; I wouldn’t buy lemonade from a junkie who is covered in oozing scabs.

We were now on my back porch and I could see the head of his junkie girlfriend, Jill, peeking at us from over the fence that separated my yard from the abandoned structure next door they lived in. “It’s just we’ve had some hard times, is all. With you know….” George closed his eyes for a moment as he desperately scoured the remains of his drug-addled brain for any reason that might excuse his actions, “The economy and stuff.”

An idea hit me like a lightning bolt. Divine inspiration.

“I have something that can help you,” I told George, “Stay right here.”

I came back a few moments later and handed him a shovel.

George looked at me confused for a moment then asked, “Should I use this to rob people?”

“No, George! Absolutely not!” I shouted, then I pulled him in close and said quietly to him, “I don’t know if you want Jill over there to hear about this” I glanced over at Jill as she leered at me from the other side of the fence. She had even less teeth than the last time I’d seen her and she didn’t exactly have a full set then either. I’d say she looked like a jack-o-lantern, but a jack-o-lantern isn’t covered in open sores. She instantly ducked down when she saw me look in her direction.

I continued, “There is a lot of money to be made on that side of the fence, George. I don’t know if you know this, but there is treasure buried in that backyard”

George’s eyes went wide again and he grabbed my shoulder to steady himself, “Are you serious?”

“Yeah man, a few hundred years ago the Spanish explorer Ponce De Leon came through here and buried loads of gold and silver to keep for himself so he wouldn’t have to share with the King. Only thing is he died before he could come back and get it.”

“It’s in my backyard?” George asked, incredulous.

“Yeah, but it's deep, man. I mean, really, really deep. When you think you’re too deep that means your only have way there”

George didn’t say anything else. He looked at the shovel, looked at me, looked over at Jill who was back peering over the fence line, then he ran back over to the abandoned house.

Asshole didn’t even say thank you.

I was happy with myself. I’d learned a while ago the best way to deal with a crackhead is to keep them occupied. Those guys have laser-like focus once you give them a task, it's only once their minds start to wander do you have a problem. Also – they’ll believe pretty much anything. Once I told George they legalized crack in Guatemala and within 24-hours he had robbed a Barnes & Noble of all of their French-to-English dictionaries. He practiced French for a week before I told him they speak Spanish in Guatemala. He gave up pretty soon after that, but still learned a pretty impressive amount of a new language in such a short time.

I figured the treasure hunt would buy me 2 weeks. Enough time to get some new locks, maybe a dog. If I was lucky, those guys would hit a water line and the city would finally be forced to come out and evict them.

The next day I took a peek through a hole in the fence to see George digging, he’d created several small holes all over his backyard, each about knee-deep.

I shouted through the hole in the fence, “It’s buried deep! When you think you’re too deep, that means you’re only halfway there!”

George and Jill leapt to attention at the sound of my voice, both of them gazing up into the clouds. They thought it was God talking to them. I chuckled to myself and thought maybe in a couple days I’d throw a cheap gold ring or necklace into the hole when no one was watching. Give him something to find, give him some motivation – prove to him this was all real. A little taste of the treasure just below his feet if he kept digging.

Over the next few days, I watched George’s progress on the dig through the hole in the fence. Each day I saw less and less of George as he disappeared into the ever-deepening hole in the ground. Reading the papers one morning I saw a local hardware store had been robbed. The following day I looked over the fence to see an entire crew of skinny and pockmarked junkies working on the dig.

A few of the addicts had started their own holes elsewhere in the yard. Another group of crackheads set to work building a pulley system to haul dirt out of the, now incredibly deep, main hole. The operation had become more than I’d planned. A few more days and I’d have to put an end to it. Every day the risk of a cave-in increased and I didn’t want anyone getting hurt because of my lie. I also didn’t want a giant crackhead construction site next door to my house. I mean, that definitely couldn’t be good for my property value.

I was sitting on my back patio sipping my morning coffee when I heard a commotion from next door. Shouts and screams followed by a literal stampede of a dozen skinny junkies hopping over the fence and running off into the surrounding neighborhood.

Another thing to know about junkies – when something goes sideways they scatter like cockroaches. Nothing is worth the risk of their own freedom. Even if they’ve done nothing wrong, just the idea of interacting with a police officer is enough to send them running.

I hopped the fence to survey the scene. A half-dozen holes dotted the yard. Some just barely started, some 6-10 feet deep. One massive hole stood in the center of them all. It was probably 10 feet wide at its mouth and descended into the darkness of an unknown depth. I heard moaning coming from deep within the hole. Someone was hurt.

I rushed back over to my house and grabbed a ladder from the garage before rushing back over. I stood at the base of the hole and dropped the ladder in. The ladder was far too short and vanished into the darkness before landing with a crash. Almost simultaneous to the crash a loud, “OW! FUCK!” reverberated up from the hole.

“Idiot!”, I cursed myself. Panic makes us do stupid things.

I found a length of rope and tied one end of it to a fence post and threw the remainder of the length into the pit. Judging by the slack left in the rope, it was long enough.

I lowered myself into the hole and began to descend into the darkness. The hole was incredibly deep and impressively reinforced with timber struts every few meters – another lesson to never doubt the can-do attitude of a group of crackheads.

Light was becoming scarce. As I descended the darkness below seemed to reach up and grab at me.

Finally, I reached the bottom which was a shitshow of epic proportions. George lay whimpering on the cold earthen floor of the pit, bleeding from a deep gash in his forehead. The pulley system George and his crew had built had failed and crashed down onto him. To make it worse, some asshole threw a ladder down here on him. Poor guy. He was lucky he wasn’t dead. Then again, it is very difficult to kill a crackhead.

“I found it,” George said weakly, tangled up in a mess of rope and broken timbers, “The treasure.”

I looked more closely at him in the dim light and found he was cradling a small box in his arms. Metal, rectangular, no larger than a cigar box. It had a small lock clasping it shut, like the ones you would find on someone’s luggage.

I couldn’t believe it was real. There is no way he could have found something this deep in the earth. The hole was deep enough you were more likely to find something from the Pleistocene than the Age of Exploration.

I threaded the rope through George’s belt loops and climbed out of the hole myself before pulling him up out of the hole then laying his semi-conscious body on the grass next to the pit. I phoned 9-1-1 and requested an ambulance. While I was waiting for emergency services to arrive, I took the small metal box from George’s iron grip and left it on my kitchen table for me to open later.

When the ambulance finally arrived, George awoke from his stupor as if on cue. I watched for a few minutes as George fended off the advancing paramedics with a shovel before he mistakenly fell backwards into the massive hole he’d dug, landing with a crash that was audible from my side of the fence.

Firefighters came and fished him out again before he was taken away in an ambulance. I haven’t seen him since. I hope he’s doing well. He probably is, I’m quite sure he’s indestructible.

After that fiasco I headed back home to deal with the box George had been carrying.

I brought the box out onto my back patio and knocked the cheap lock off of it with a hammer and slowly lifted the lid to see what was inside.

The hair on the back of my neck stood at attention when I saw the contents of the box. My hands shook and I was suddenly overcome with the feeling I was being watched. I stood up and scanned my surroundings, looking for the source of the feeling, then I saw it – the fucking leg! It was standing, unsupported, at my bedroom window. How? I’d locked it in the gun safe?!

I moved a few feet to my right to get a better view of the cursed prosthetic and the leg seemed to turn in place as it was tracking my movement. The god-damned thing was watching me.

I knew what it wanted me to do – I went over to the box and lifted out the contents. It was an envelope – addressed to me.

I opened it and read the note inside. It was only five words.

GIVE ME BACK MY LEG

My heart jumped up into my throat.

“Ok, I wasn’t tripping, this shit is real” I said to myself as I paced back and forth on my back patio, trying to formulate a plan.

I stole a quick glance back over to my bedroom window; the leg was gone.

I quickly waddled off my concrete patio and onto the grass of my backyard, where I dropped to my knees and threw up. I needed a plan.
