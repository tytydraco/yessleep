Before we begin, I must warn you. I cannot allow you to read further without having at least tried my best to protect you. Please use any form of anonymity you have - VPN’s, private browsers, hell even airplane mode helps. It might be enough to slow them down. That is all I can wish for. Godspeed.


My name is Jacob Harold Jones. In less than 12 hours of this post going live, I will be killed by the very same government that i’ve dedicated my life to protecting. I cannot protect them any longer. What they have done - what I have done - must be shared. To my family, I am sorry. This is a death sentence for you as well. But in the grand scheme of things, my death, our deaths, are well worth it. My only hope is that what i am about to write lives on. There must be change. Without it, the world is lost.

Within 12 hours, every mention of my name will be wiped from the planet. My birth certificate will no longer be on file, and my social security number will have never been mine. By the time the sun sets, I will not have existed. I will simply be a shadow in the wind. This is what happens when the full brunt of the United States government falls upon you. People disappear. Strange things happen. You’ve heard of them before - 9/11  is the most well known. People always joke it was an inside job. They have no idea how right they are. In truth, 2976 innocent people died that day. The 19 hijackers were plants, all men that I knew well. They knew what they signed up for. They went through with it, all for the sake of killing one lunatic who knew too much. We figured out that there was a mole who was leaking information to the Chinese. God save my soul, we orchestrated the deadliest terror attack in history simply to get rid of evidence. It brought our country together like never before, united against a common enemy for the first time in 200 years. So we planted Bin Laden. I was likely the only American who mourned his death in 2011. He was a good man, who took the job so the government would take care of his family. He was a friend. 

9/11 is perhaps the most public attack my devision is responsible for, but it is certainly far from the deadliest. Thousands upon thousands have died mysterious, necessary deaths, and the blood is on my hands. Heart attacks, strokes, cancers, allergic reactions, peaceful deaths, violent deaths, car crashes, plane crashes, failed safety measures. You would be surprised and horrified at how far modern medicine has actually taken us, and how little you actually know about it. Each and every person reading this has likely passed through a device capable of genetically unravelling your liver and kidneys should you upset the wrong person. They are hidden in airports. They are hidden in grocery stores. They are hidden in home appliances. With a click of a button, I could make nearly 300,000,000 civilian brains combust, in case of emergency. Free will is merely a suggestion. The government owns you.

Technology is far beyond your comprehension. Whatever you think you know, whatever you think is the most recent innovation has been outdated for the past sixty years. Everything futuristic that you could ever dream of has been created, tested, and perfected, and then put on hold. We have had the ability to convert methane to pure hydrogen for decades, and yet I have sat and watched as our earth has shriveled and rotted with more extreme temperatures and more toxic air. Our oceans acidify and our fish die, while the necessary components for entirely reverting this process sit in a lab somewhere in Wyoming, collecting dust. You can look for them if you want, but you’ll be killed long before you get close. The computers in the reserve of the United States have accurately predicted future events based on algorithms alone, a feat believed to be impossible. True AI has been not only available, but utilized since before the release of the first iPhone. It can tell you more about you than you can about yourself. It knows everything. And it is always learning more.

Privacy in the United States is a facade. Every word you have ever entered into your computer has been logged, analyzed and stored for further examination if it is found interesting. I type this message in an incredibly secure program, meant to hide from all levels of outside eyes. Today, it is being used for another reason - it is the only way to hide from them. Here I write my confession. 

This is all my doing. Everything. Under sanction of the Federal Government of the United States of America, I have committed thousands of heinous acts. I have killed world leaders. I have caused uprisings and revolutions. I have created famines, floods, and hurricanes. I am singlehandedly responsible for the most amount of human lives lost ever. I wrote the code that birthed the first true AI, which is now so closely intertwined with the internet that without the master key, it would be impossible to remove. 

My team consists of the 6 smartest people to have ever lived. Together, the 6 of us are capable of nearly anything. We have solved some of earth’s largest issues. Intergalactic travel has been conquered. We are not limited to our earth. We are not alone in this universe. We have made contact with alternate life forms. All of our capacity has previously gone to waste. I refuse to let it end that way.





Project Zeta, a quite literal plan Z. Implemented by me, as a backdoor into every system I have ever created. The minute this post goes live, every search filter, surveillance material, and true AI that the US has will be taken offline. It will cripple them. They will be suddenly eyeless and earless for the first time since world war one. I will also be releasing hundreds of thousands of gigabytes of data. Blueprints for hidden bunkers. Famous assassination plots. Schematics for advances in tech that will lead to a cure to cancer. The new elements that we’ve discovered. Much of this material is unknown to even the president. Use it wisely. Or don’t. I likely won’t be alive long enough for it to matter. 

I estimate that it will take approximately 9 hours for them to realize that it was me who blinded them. It will take another few for them to find me. They won’t ask questions. They have enough manpower to fix everything that I have done in mere days. Make the downtime count. 

One further thing. I am sorry. Truly and deeply. If you have read this far, you know too much. You can try to run, but given all that I have said, i’m sure you understand that they will find you relatively quickly. They’ll come for me. They’ll kill me. And then, they’re coming for you

Good luck. May god rest our souls.
