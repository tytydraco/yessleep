I’m going to start off and acknowledge how absurd I might sound to you. You might think I’m fabricating this entire story for internet clout, but I assure you I’m not. Well I cannot force you to believe me nor will I attempt to do so. I will simply share what happened during one summer in my youth. First, I’ll explain why I believe this wasn’t a mistaken memory or hallucination.

My family has lived on our land for nearly 200 years. We have taken care of the land and it has cared for us in turn. It is my ancestral home in a very real sense. That said, our land has seen a few odd occurrences over the years. I don’t claim our land is haunted, but I do share my grandma’s belief. She believes that our ancestors are looking down on us, protecting our family as a sort of guardian angel. This is a comforting feeling, at least to me, and I have never felt unsafe on our land. My grandma has told me of some paranormal experiences she has had over the years. Many occurred on our land, but one particularly relevant event to this story happened elsewhere. 

During a cruise trip to the Caribbean, she and my grandpa were on shore on an island. My grandpa had gone ahead on a trail while my grandma had lagged behind a little. As she was cresting a hill a young girl ran up behind her. The child appeared to be scared of something pointing to the bay yelling that “a ship is coming”. My grandma tried to comfort the child looking up towards the bay. She saw a sailing ship, like one of the ones from colonial times. The ship was far off but she said it was hard to discern, almost like a mirage. She said she had called out to my grandpa before turning back to the child. However, when she looked back, the child was gone. No sound of her running off, no footprints, nothing. My grandma told me this story years ago describing what she experienced as a time-slip. An odd overlap of present and past that manifested in a, for lack of a better term, ghost ship and child. I told you this story to establish a history of odd occurrences that happen to some of our family members. It has appeared more of them have occurred to me than my brother despite us being nigh inseparable when we were younger. 
	
My time-slip occurred during a summer when I was nine or ten. That summer two friends spent most weekdays with us as their mom had to work. Most days we would play videogames or explore the woods of our property. It was one of the days we decided to explore when the event occurred. Our group of four were following my brother’s dog. She was wandering some game trails with us making mild conversation. We debated what would happen if we got lost. I said that we could eat some twigs and leaves which solicited laughter from our group.

After we walked through some brush we came upon a fence line that I was familiar with. My memory grows hazy here. The others were with me, but they weren’t involved in the time-slip.  My brother’s dog had crossed the fenceline and I had followed despite the land I was entering not being ours. I recall ducking under the middle strand of wire and when I came up the woods had vanished. I was confused, as anyone would be. I looked around for our dog but couldn’t find her. I did notice however how similar the scene before me looked. It was a fenced clearing that was an acre in size. I recognized the acre-sized clearing where my home should have sat. I was puzzled as to what I was looking at. The fence looked much newer and the three mesquite trees were nothing more than saplings. The windmill creaked with the wind, but a blade that was broken my entire life was undamaged. The sun shone a little brighter than normal. The entire time I felt dazed, like in a lucid dream. After a few moments I got an uncanny feeling and decided to turn back. When I crossed back, I turned and saw the woods had returned to normal. I can’t recall much after that but that could simply be due to the event happening over a decade ago.

 I know some cultures crossing a boundary of some kind could result in you crossing over into another dimension. Though far-fetched, it could be another explanation besides a time-slip. Despite trying to replicate the event I have thus far been unable. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this phenomenon and could possibly shed some light on what I encountered.
