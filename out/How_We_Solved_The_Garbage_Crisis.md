I didn’t mean for it to happen. None of us did. When we created Plastivora, we thought we were saving the world. And at first, we were.

I remember the day we deployed it, watching the Great Pacific Garbage Patch shrink on satellite feeds. It was miraculous, like something out of a dream. Mountains of plastic waste dissolved into harmless organic compounds, leaving the oceans clearer than they’d been in centuries. People cheered for us, called us heroes. For the first time in my life, I felt like we were fixing something instead of breaking it.

But that was before the first reports came in.

At first, it was small things—plastic pipes degrading, car parts failing unexpectedly. We told ourselves it was nothing. “Just anomalies,” we said. “Plastivora is doing what it’s supposed to do.” But deep down, I knew something was wrong. The bacteria had begun to spread faster than we anticipated, carried by water, wind, and even insects. It wasn’t just eating discarded waste anymore. It was eating everything.

I’ll never forget the Tokyo pipeline explosion. The news footage showed fire consuming entire neighborhoods, the result of gas pipes weakened by the bacteria. It was just the beginning. Airplanes fell from the sky. Power grids collapsed as cables disintegrated. Hospitals turned into death traps as critical machines failed, their plastic components turning to dust.

And then came the infections.

It started in rural areas—livestock wasting away, crops wilting, and then people. Victims would feel a crawling, burning sensation under their skin. By the time they got to the hospitals, it was too late. The bacteria weren’t just targeting plastic anymore; they’d evolved to feed on organic polymers—on us. I saw the pictures of autopsies. Flesh turned to jelly, veins hollowed out like tunnels, organs riddled with holes.

We tried to stop it. God, we tried. My team and I locked ourselves away in a remote Arctic lab, racing against the clock to develop a countermeasure. But every attempt failed. The bacteria adapted faster than we could design defenses. It wasn’t just a microorganism anymore. It was alive.

I’ll never forget the night Khan called me to the microscope. “Alice,” he whispered, his voice trembling, “you need to see this.”

I peered into the eyepiece, and my stomach twisted. The bacteria wasn’t just consuming anymore—it was organizing. I saw tiny glowing structures, pulsating like a heartbeat. It wasn’t just alive; it was thinking.

The next day, the world went dark. Communications failed. The satellites went offline. We were cut off, left with nothing but the howling wind and the slow, creeping realization that we were the only ones left.

Now it’s just me. The others are gone—Khan, Martinez, even Liam. Infection got some of them. The rest… well, you can only take so much despair. The lab is quiet now, except for the faint hum of the generators and the eerie sound of the wind outside.

My hands are shaking as I write this. The skin on my forearm is blistered and raw, and I know what that means. The bacteria is inside me now, crawling through my veins, eating me alive from the inside out. I’ve locked myself in the observation room, but it doesn’t matter. The walls are glowing faintly now, shimmering with the same pulsating light I saw under the microscope.

It’s spreading. Organizing. Growing. The snow outside the lab sparkles unnaturally under the aurora, and I know it won’t stop until it’s consumed everything.

If anyone finds this, burn it all. Burn me, burn this lab, burn the snow itself. Don’t let Plastivora reach you. We thought we were saving the world, but we unleashed something worse.

The bacteria doesn’t just eat. It thinks. And now, it hungers.
