It was two years ago. We were heading out on holiday to a friend’s house, driving through the middle of nowhere at night. Like always, we were talking about the most random, useless things.



“Oh my God, Val—you can’t be serious. Are you really suggesting we rob a convenience store?”



“Why not, girl? I told you—they always get robbed and no one gets caught. Middle of the night, middle of nowhere. No way the pigs catch us.”



“You can’t be serious, Val. We’re not robbing a store—we’re not a gang!”



“Chill a little, Jessie. Nothing’s gonna go wrong.”



“Are you two seriously talking about this right now? Tell them something, Roxy!”



And I wish I had stopped them right then. But instead... I joined in.



“Well... we only come to this world once, right? Like Raven said—what could go wrong, huh?”



“Nothinggg!” Val shouted, laughing.



“I can’t believe you bitches.”



“Don’t be a crybaby, Jessie—GIRL GANG TIME, LET’S GOOOOO!”



“GIRL GANG!”



“GIRL GANG!”



We screamed as Val slammed the gas pedal. The dead air of the desert filled with our shouts. Before long, we pulled up in front of the store.



“Okay but real talk,” Raven said from the backseat, lazily watching the desert blur by, “What would y’all want written on your tombstone?”



“Hot,” Val said instantly, “And loaded.”



“I want mine to say: fuck around and found out,” Jessie giggled, her anxiety forgotten for a moment.



“Mine just needs glitter,” I mumbled. “And maybe, like… an empty lipstick case next to it.”



We all laughed. Even Raven cracked a smile.



I didn’t know it yet, but only one of us was getting one.



It was an old gas station store, straight out of every horror flick ever, complete with buzzing neon lights and a single, flickering bulb above the pumps. The sign said "MIDNIGHT MARKET" in big, faded letters, almost like a dare rather than a welcome.



Jessie tugged nervously at her sleeves. "Guys, I seriously don't have a good feeling about this place."



Val rolled her eyes, shoving a pink ski mask into Jessie's hands. "Relax, princess. We’ll be in and out before they even know it."



Raven stepped out of the car, calm as ever. Her dark eyes scanned the empty lot, taking in the eerie quiet and the way shadows seemed to stretch a little too long around the corners of the building.



"You okay, Rox?" Jessie whispered to me, her eyes huge and pleading.



"Girl, chill," I said, forcing a smile as I slid my mask down. "We got this."



Val marched up to the door first, practically dancing, a shiny revolver dangling from her fingers like it was part of her outfit.



Raven followed, quiet and watchful, while Jessie hesitated just a second too long before stepping in behind her. I trailed last, stomach tightening.



I caught our reflections in the glass door.



We looked like girls. Just girls.



But something about the storefront…



It didn’t look back.



The door jingled like we were just four girls going on a candy run.



Inside, it was too clean. Too cold. The kind of cold that sinks through your jacket and settles behind your teeth.



Music drifted from somewhere above us—low and warped. A syrupy, old-school love song, like something that should be playing over the end of a prom.



The kind of prom where nobody makes it home.



I blinked, and for a second, I could’ve sworn the ceiling lights pulsed in time with the music.



Near the window, an antique gumball machine stood tall and gleaming—way too pristine for a desert dump like this.



A metal tag was bolted to the glass:



DO NOT TOUCH UNLESS YOU’RE HUNGRY.



“That’s... weird,” Raven muttered.



The machine gave a soft click.



We didn’t touch it.



The place was cold—freezing even—and silent enough to hear our shaky breaths. Everything was weirdly neat, shelves packed full with snacks, every item precisely lined up. Too perfect. Uncomfortably perfect.



The cashier stood behind the counter, a tall, pale guy with eyes so dark they looked painted on. He didn't jump. Didn't flinch. Didn't blink. He just stared at us—like he’d been waiting.



Val pointed her gun at him. "Hands up, hot stuff. Money. Now."



He obeyed—but too slowly. Too calm. His hands rose like he was performing, not surrendering. Then came the voice:



"Take it," he said, almost a whisper. "It’s yours."



The register clicked open by itself. No key. No touch. Just a soft metallic chime.



We froze.



Val glanced at me, then at the register, then back at him. “Okay... well. Shit. Guess this is happening.”



Jessie looked like she was about to cry. "Guys, let’s just—let’s just go. I told you—"



"Shut up," Val snapped, ducking behind the counter.



Something buzzed. The overhead lights flickered, just once.



Then again.



And again.



Each flash stretched Sam’s shadow longer. Like it was growing toward us.



Raven stood still, eyes narrowing. I could see her mouth moving—counting.



"Every fourth second," she said softly. "It pulses."



I turned toward the door. My gut twisted with the kind of dread that makes your hands shake without knowing why.



And then I felt it.



Not saw. Felt.

A shift in the air—like the walls inhaled.



I grabbed the door handle.



Locked.



Of course it was locked.



I jiggled it harder. Nothing. The bell above it chimed anyway, like it was laughing at me.



Behind me, Jessie gasped. "I think—it’s watching us."



I passed the drink cooler and noticed smears—bloody handprints, faint but sticky, as if someone had tried to claw their way out from the inside.



And the snacks...



I paused.



One bag read "Cassie-flavored popcorn."



Another: "Katie Crunch."



I didn’t know a Cassie. Or a Katie.



But maybe someone had.



Raven walked slowly down the nearest aisle, eyes narrowed suspiciously. She reached out, touching something behind a cereal box and pulled her hand back sharply. Her fingers came away red.



“Blood,” she whispered, horrified, as she stepped back. “There’s blood on everything.”



Jessie gasped softly, stepping toward me, her hands reaching for mine. “Roxy, please—”



Val cut her off, laughing nervously, too loudly, as she swung back toward the cashier. “So, hot stuff, got a girlfriend?”



He tilted his head, eyes glittering like obsidian, and leaned toward her slowly, deliberately, his voice a velvety whisper as his smile widened impossibly.



"You smell different when you’re afraid."



The words slid through the air like a blade wrapped in silk.



I froze.



Val didn’t say anything this time. Her cocky grin faded just a little. The gun in her hand lowered—not much, but enough. Raven went still. Jessie let out a quiet noise like a swallowed scream.



My breath caught hard in my throat, and for the first time, I realized—really realized—that we were trapped here.



And we weren’t alone.



The lights above us flickered once. The soft song on the speakers warped, like the tape inside had melted. The walls didn’t move, but they felt closer. The air tightened.



I stepped back.



Jessie whispered, “I wanna go. Roxy. I wanna go.”



The hum of the freezer deepened, as if something was breathing behind it.



Then Val snapped—“Fuck this!”—and sprinted to the windows.



We ran after her like animals caught in a trap. Desperate. Stupid. Screaming.



Jessie’s fingers left foggy trails as she frantically slapped the cold panes.



"Break it!" Val shouted, her voice cracking at the edges of her tough-girl act.



Raven didn’t hesitate. She grabbed a metal rack—the one that had held stupid souvenirs with smiley faces—and swung.



The glass shattered, a rain of jagged crystals exploding outward—only to freeze mid-air and glide gently backward, reforming in perfect silence. Not a single crack remained.



"No way," Jessie whimpered, her voice tight with disbelief. She turned slowly toward us, her breath fogging visibly, the air colder than any gas station freezer should be. "Did—did anyone else just see that?"



"Yeah," I whispered, my mouth dry, my tongue a rough patch of sandpaper.



The cashier chuckled softly behind us. The sound crawled into my ears, gentle and sickening, like honey mixed with blood. We turned together to face him, drawn by the gravity of his voice.



He was no longer smiling politely. His grin was stretched impossibly wide, a raw gash carved into white skin, crowded by teeth that shouldn’t fit in a human mouth. His eyes were two slick wells of blackness, shimmering darkly like spilled oil under fluorescent lights.



Val’s breathing came in short, angry bursts. "What the fuck are you?"



His voice, when it came, wasn’t human—not entirely. It echoed slightly, like it bounced around in a cave before finding its way out of his throat.



"Just your cashier," he said softly, spreading his pale, delicate hands in mock innocence. "Doing my job. Helping you… make choices."



"What choices?" Jessie’s voice was almost a sob.



He tilted his head slowly, smoothly, unnatural as a doll. "One girl walks out. Decide quickly, please."



"No," Raven said quietly, voice low, shaking her head firmly, stepping toward him. "You can’t trap us—"



"Oh, sweetheart," he purred. "It’s already done."



He raised one hand slowly, gesturing toward the wall of security monitors behind the counter. Grainy black-and-white footage flickered silently. Our eyes locked on the screens, watching shapes moving, familiar silhouettes of past victims. I saw girls, panicked and violent, tearing each other apart like animals, the floor growing dark beneath them.



Jessie stumbled backward, fumbling in her pocket, frantically pulling out her phone. "Fuck this, I’m calling the cops—"



The moment she pressed call, she screamed, high and ragged. The phone glowed a searing orange, smoke curling from her palm as she threw it to the floor. Her hand was blistered raw, skin bubbling painfully red.



He laughed again, soft and syrupy. "No outside calls. Store policy."



Valerie snapped. She lunged at him, her gun shaking in her outstretched hand, fury overcoming fear. "Let us go, asshole!"



The cashier only smiled wider, calmly, as though she’d offered him candy instead of threats. With barely a twitch of his eyes, something cracked sharply through the air—wet and sickening. Valerie’s neck twisted violently



Her gun hit the floor first.



Then her knees.



Then her head rolled sideways like a snapped doll’s.



Too quiet. Too fast.



Like the store didn’t just kill her—it collected her.



"Val!" Jessie shrieked, voice breaking with raw panic, rushing forward to catch her limp body as it crumpled.



My own scream stuck deep in my throat, choking on shock as Val’s eyes fluttered open, wide and confused. Her lips moved slowly, mechanically, as if something puppeteered her broken body from the inside out.



"Choose one," she whispered sweetly, blood dripping down her chin, smiling like a doll whose strings had snapped. "Choose one… choose one…"



Jessie sobbed violently, holding Val’s lifeless hand, her eyes streaming. I felt the cold seep deeper into my bones, crawling through my veins, thick and icy.



I caught my reflection in the freezer door as I backed away from Valerie’s twitching body.



I wasn’t smiling. I knew I wasn’t.



But the reflection was. Just a little. Just enough to show teeth.



Raven stood paralyzed, horror etched onto her face. She barely moved as Val’s corpse sat up slowly, head tilted grotesquely sideways, the crackling of broken bones grinding together loud in the silence.



Valerie looked right at me, eyes glassy but still full of knowing, as if death had told her some private joke we’d never understand. Her lips never stopped moving, gently repeating the same soft chant:



"Choose one… choose one… choose one…"



Jessie stumbled backward from Valerie’s body, her breathing ragged, eyes wide and wild. "Please—please, just let us go," she sobbed, mascara running in thick black lines down her pale cheeks. She looked desperately at the cashier, then at me, grabbing my wrist hard enough to bruise. "Roxy, we—we don’t deserve this. I'll do anything—anything—just make it stop."



“I’ll clean it all up, I swear,” she whimpered. “I won’t tell anyone. I just want to go home.”





Her pleas echoed in the cold air of the gas station, unanswered.



Raven remained strangely quiet, kneeling slowly beside Val’s corpse. Her hands trembled as she carefully closed Val’s staring eyes. She whispered something under her breath, words low and secretive, urgent and familiar, like an ancient prayer.



"What are you doing?" I whispered, fear knotting tight in my chest.



Raven didn’t look up, instead frantically pulling salt packets from the snack aisle shelves, tearing them open with shaking fingers and pouring a circle on the tiled floor around us. She murmured faster, voice wavering but determined, forming a shaky occult ring around Val’s unmoving body.



"Protection," Raven hissed, eyes desperate but focused. "It might hold it back. It's supposed to."



Jessie watched her, horrified disbelief twisting her expression. "Are you fucking serious right now? Magic, Raven? We need real help—not witchcraft!"



Raven ignored her, eyes squeezed shut in concentration, chanting softly. Her whispered words spilled out like black velvet ribbons, strange and unsettling.



But as she finished the final word, silence dropped like an axe.



Nothing happened. No protection. No escape. Just the cashier’s quiet laughter, floating over the aisles.



"Did you really think salt would help?" His voice was amused, lightly mocking. "This isn’t a ghost story."



Jessie screamed, raw frustration and panic echoing off the sterile, white walls. "Why are we still here? Raven, your stupid voodoo bullshit never works! It didn’t even work when—"



She froze suddenly, words catching in her throat. Raven’s eyes snapped open sharply, glistening darkly.



"When what, Jess?" Raven’s voice cut the silence sharply.



Jessie’s face went pale. "Nothing," she whispered, suddenly afraid. "I—I didn’t mean—"



"Didn’t mean what?" Raven stood, fists clenched, voice dangerously calm. "Didn’t mean for me to know you fucked my boyfriend?"



The air thickened around us, the silence oppressive, suffocating. Jessie recoiled, her gaze darting between me and Raven. "It—it wasn’t like that, Raven, please—"



"No?" Raven spat bitterly, voice venomous. "Then what was it like? Did you just trip into his bed?"



Jessie’s eyes filled again, tears spilling, voice shaking. "Like you're any better! You stole from all of us! Money, makeup, everything! We knew it was you, Raven. We just didn't tell you because we felt bad."



Raven froze, expression turning from fury to icy shock, eyes darkening with shame and anger. "Shut your fucking mouth, Jessie."



Jessie didn’t stop. Her fear had broken through to rage, eyes blazing, face twisting in unrecognizable fury. "You think you're so innocent, Raven, but you're just a lying, stealing, fake little bitch!"



The tension snapped sharply between them, raw and violent.



A soft whisper slid into my ears like hot breath, velvet and sinister.



"Kill them. Get out. It’s easy."



My stomach lurched sickly. The voice wasn’t mine, yet it spoke from deep within my bones. I shook my head, desperate to silence the darkness blooming inside me.



Around us, shelves rearranged subtly, impossibly, silently. Packets of razor blades, sharp scissors, kitchen knives—all appeared neatly, perfectly placed within arm’s reach. Inviting us. Begging us.



Jessie’s eyes caught the gleam of a large kitchen knife first. She reached for it, trembling. Her innocent face, the girl who’d sketched soft hearts in her notebooks, distorted with something monstrous. Lips twisted, eyes gleaming with a sudden, animal rage.



She lunged for Raven, blade flashing in a silver arc.



As they collided, Jessie's body slammed into a display rack. The glass gumball machine exploded, candy flying in every direction, bouncing off tiles slick with blood. The music hit its chorus—some old-timey love ballad warped through hell.



Blood sprayed against the freezer door in long, painterly streaks, glittering in the flickering lights.



Raven barely had time to scream as Jessie tackled her, wild, relentless, brutally slashing. 



"Jessie!" I cried, horror squeezing my lungs like a vice. "Stop!"



But Jessie couldn’t hear me. Or wouldn’t. Her movements were feral, unrecognizable, blade stabbing and twisting, teeth bared, eyes burning with a dark, obsessive fury. Blood spattered across her face, and she only screamed louder, angrier, triumphant:



"You never deserved him, Raven! Never!"



Raven’s voice faded to a soft, choking gurgle, eyes wide and staring, life slipping away in scarlet pools beneath her.



Jessie stood slowly, her breathing ragged, blade dripping. Blood streaked her cheeks, her chest heaving violently. She looked at me, her gaze feral yet pleading, trapped somewhere between horror and exhilaration.



"I—I had to," she whispered, her voice trembling, eyes glazed. "I did it for us, Rox. Now he has to let us leave."



Valerie’s corpse smiled wider, softly whispering:



"Choose one… choose one… choose one…"



The cashier chuckled again, softly, watching us like an audience at a bloody play. His voice slithered out, smooth and deadly:



"Almost there, girls. Just a little more blood, and we’ll have a winner."



Raven lay on the floor, a broken doll sprawled across white tiles stained dark red. Her breaths came slow, ragged gasps echoing weakly through the too-still air, a sound I’d never forget. Jessie stood a few feet away, clutching the knife, eyes hollowed out, staring at nothing. Her sleeves soaked in Raven’s blood, dripping in thick, scarlet beads to the floor.



Somehow, in the chaos, Valerie’s gun had found its way into my hands. It felt heavy, the cold metal pressing against my sweaty palm, grip slippery with fear and confusion. My breath shook, watching Raven’s eyes struggle to focus on mine, filled with silent, desperate pleading.



The cashier leaned comfortably against the counter, casually smiling like we were merely teenagers squabbling over candy, his eyes black pools absorbing the horror we’d created.



"Well," he said gently, drawing out the word like a patient teacher, "we're almost done."



"Please," Jessie whispered, dropping the knife suddenly, clattering loudly to the tile. She stepped toward me, shaking, leaving bloody footprints. "Roxy, I—I didn't mean it. You know that, right? He made me—I couldn’t stop."



My throat tightened. "Jessie, you killed her," I choked out, eyes stinging, glancing again at Raven, blood pooling steadily around her body. "You—"



"She betrayed us!" Jessie’s voice cracked wildly, desperate. "I did it for you, Roxy—for us!"



"Did you?" the cashier murmured softly, eyebrows raised in gentle skepticism. His voice slid between us like silk and razors. "One bullet. One choice. That’s the deal."



Raven’s voice, barely more than a whisper, slipped weakly into the silence. She coughed wetly, scarlet trickling from the corner of her mouth. Her gaze locked onto mine, fierce yet fading, eyes pleading with an unbearable truth.



"You’ll never leave, Roxy," she gasped, words trembling, shaking my bones. "He owns you now. He owns us all."



Her head fell back, eyes fluttering, breath shallow and fading fast.



"Don’t listen to her," Jessie whimpered, eyes wild, stumbling forward. "Please, Roxy. It’s you and me—like always. You promised."



I raised the gun, heart hammering like a trapped bird in my chest, hands trembling violently. Jessie’s eyes widened, lips forming a silent plea, betrayed disbelief etched across her tear-streaked face.



But as I met her gaze, something deep inside me shifted. A sudden, cold clarity spread through me—dark, seductive, powerful. I felt calm. I felt nothing. No fear, no guilt, only the chilling realization that her life was now mine to take or spare. And I liked it.



Then I turned to the freezer again.



My reflection was watching me—smiling wide now. Red smeared across her mouth like lipstick.



Behind me, in the freezer’s reflection, I saw the others.



Raven—on the floor. Jessie—still reaching for help. Val—smiling too wide.



And me.



Smiling like I’d been doing it the whole time.



And this time... I smiled back.



"Rox—" she began, choking on my name.



I squeezed the trigger without hesitation.



The blast echoed like thunder, deafening in the sterile air. Jessie fell silently, body collapsing like a puppet whose strings were cut, disbelief still frozen on her face.



I lowered the gun, exhaling slowly. The room was still for a single, suspended moment.



Then the store erupted around me in soft, sinister applause. The shelves rattled gently, snack machines buzzing and humming like a cheerful audience, whispers and laughter rising from empty aisles. A twisted celebration, hidden voices cheering quietly from behind rows of candy bars, potato chips, and bottled drinks.



"Well done," the cashier purred softly, eyes gleaming with twisted pride. He smiled warmly, as if congratulating a beloved student.



I stared at Jessie's body, feeling nothing. No tears, no regret. The rush of control filled me, a dark, intoxicating thrill I’d never known before.



Valerie’s corpse smiled wider, twisted neck creaking grotesquely as she whispered softly, approvingly:



"Chosen one… chosen one… chosen one…"



The cashier’s eyes, blacker than midnight, met mine gently, knowingly, possessively.



The silence in the store felt cleaner now. Calmer. Like it had finally exhaled.



The cashier stepped around the counter, careful not to step in the blood. His smile had softened—not smug, not cruel, just… satisfied.



"You won," he said gently, as if announcing a prize. "You can leave now."



With a soft click, the glass door unlocked. The deadbolt slid back on its own, the bell above it chiming sweetly like it always had. As if none of this ever happened.



I walked to the door slowly, still holding the gun, my fingers sticky with blood. I could see the black sky outside now, no longer that voidless blur. There were stars. The desert. Freedom.



But I stopped with my hand on the door.



I didn’t want to go.



That’s the part I hadn’t expected. I wasn’t scared anymore. I wasn’t even angry. I felt light. Electric. Like something had cracked open inside me and all the worms crawling beneath had finally come out to stretch.



I liked the way it felt—when Jessie begged. When Raven whimpered.

When I pulled the trigger.



Control. Power.



No more playing along. No more pretending to be the quiet one, the funny one, the glue in the group.



They never saw it, but he did. He always did.



The cashier gave me a nod, like he already knew. He stepped aside. "It’s yours now," he said. "If you want it."



"Every store needs a cashier"



He walked through the door and vanished into the dark without a sound.



I looked around once more. At the shelves that never ran out. At the freezer humming with something cold and alive. At the counter.



And then I moved behind it, slowly, like I was taking my rightful place.



The nametag sat waiting by the register. I picked it up.



SAM.



I pinned it to my shirt and smoothed my hair down.



It didn’t matter what it stood for.



I already knew it was mine.



Outside, a pair of headlights pulled into the lot. Dust swirled behind the car. Four silhouettes inside. Girls.



The bell jingled as the door opened, and I smiled.



"Welcome to Midnight Market," I said sweetly.
