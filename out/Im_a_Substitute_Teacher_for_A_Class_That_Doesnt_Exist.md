One week ago, I was interviewed for a job position as a substitute teacher in Orlando. I have a PHD in Humanities and Social Sciences. I was not satisfied with my old job, so I thought I would take a break and find a temporary job pursuing my passion for the subject and teaching it. Everything seemed fine with the interview, and due to my professional attitude, I was offered the job on the spot. My ego was inflated for a second until a second thought hit me, “Why was I hired right here on the spot? There must be other candidates for this job”.

Thinking back on the interview I remember them saying that this class is particularly tough, not because of the demanding material that needs to be condensed and taught but because of the class. Now I have no idea what they meant by that, so I shrugged it off at the time and continued the interview as usual. I probably should of asked what they meant by that statement but its too late now, the class is already in session and I’m about to walk in.

Except, there is no one here.

Now I am accustomed to teenagers being late for class, heck even I used to be late for some classes back in my day. But there always were at least 5 people in the classroom. I walked outside to check if I was at the correct room, “ Social Sciences And Humanities “ it read on the door. I walked back in and decided to wait. “ I am going to wait at least 10 minutes before walking out and reporting this to the headmaster. “ I thought to myself. Maybe two minutes passed, until I heard a faint noise coming from the hallway. “ Finally, someone is going to show up” I thought nervously.

A kid opened the door, the movement of the arm as it opened the door looked animated, behind the first kid marched the other students, 20 of them to be exact. They all walked in the same straight line, their steps synchronized and their movements robotic. All of them sat on their chairs in the exact same manner, at the exact same time, opened their notebooks in synchronization and lifted their heads at the exact same pace and started staring at me. Their eyes were wide open, none of them seemed to blink, or react in any way. Just staring.

I needed a second to comprehend what just happened.

I quickly snapped back to reality and decided to ignore their antics. “ They must be pulling some kind of prank on me” I thought. Standing up, I reached for the attendance sheet that was laid on the desk. The kids started writing something down in their notebooks, but I paid no attention to them, they were probably just doodling waiting for the class to start. When I saw the attendance sheet I was quite shocked.

There were no names.

Now I have no problem asking each person what their name is, but it would have been a bit of a help if the teacher before me left some kind of notes or marks. “ Sorry guys, give me just a moment” I said to the kids and reached for the other files on the desk. There are no names here either, no grades, nothing. At this point I felt a chill in my spine. I felt that something is wrong, and I needed to get out of there. “I will be back shortly, please remain seated “ I said to the kids and quickly paced to the door with long steps. As my hand reached for the door handle, I saw it disappear right in front of me. I stood there in shock with my hand clutching nothing but the air. I kept my glance right in front of me, I dared not turn around. I could feel that something was watching me with intense malice, and If I turn around, it would be the death of me.

A voice snapped from one of the students “Please Mr. Morris, let’s continue from where Mr. Bennet left off”. The voice sounded robotic, like a text to speech app coming from a phone. But I know for certain that it wasn’t a phone, it was one of the students. I mustered up the courage to face the students, their heads tilted forward and were staring at me more intensely than before. “ Umm.. Where did Mr. Bennet stop? “ I asked nervously, panicking from the inside and glancing around the room for any way out. The room was filled with nothing but silence, no response, nothing. My eyes turned to the windows, I swear that you could see the school entrance and the gate from here, but now… There was nothing. Just an endless patch of grass extending beyond my vision. I am trapped here…

The clock on the wall has 20 minutes left until the class ends. The tables are filled with the same notebooks, open on the same page, and the kids are growing more and more unsettling to look at. It’s as if I’m looking at predatorial hunger in their eyes. From a safe distance I dared to look at one of the notebooks open on the desk. It read “ Mr. Morris teaches about the flavor of fear and helplessness.” As I read this I shook to my core, I didn’t want to but I continued reading past the title. “Mr. Morris walks into the classroom to realize that we are not here, but in fact we are. He starts off by doubting our attendance and thinking it’s a prank when in fact it is not. His smell of doubt helped us find our way to the classroom. He continues to grow in doubt and fear, reaches for the door, looks around for an escape, his fear and helplessness grows, my hunger grows. “ I stopped reading and instinctively pulled back as fast as I could. My body slammed roughly against the wall, my heart is beating out of my chest and my eyes are hyper fixated on any movement that may come from the students or anywhere in my peripheral vision.

Their eyes opened even wider, a grin so atrocious filled their faces and their hands were clawing the tables tightly. They all began to droll and stood up in the same manner and at the same time, all in perfect synchronization. I am beyond terrified and shaking, I can’t move, I feel like a deer in headlights and the car keeps approaching closer and closer and closer. My mouth can’t muster up a sound and I can feel the end of me coming. The students are approaching closer and closer, one small step at a time, their faces are growing bigger and more grotesque with each step. “Life is ending, I am going to die, please God save me, please a miracle, anything…”

And then the bell rang.

The kids that have gotten so close to me suddenly turned around for the door and opened it, they all left in the same robotic manner. Exiting the door one by one without even turning their heads to look at me. The second I saw the last student leave I ran for the door and never looked back.

As far as I know now the school is still open and there is a new job posting for a substitute teacher. If you ever come across one and are hired on the spot, do yourself a favor and run as quickly as possible and never return.
