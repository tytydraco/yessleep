Titled: It never ends how I planned 

Falling in loves not my problem oh baby I can fall just fine 
The problem seems to be landing I always ask myself will he stay this time 
But the answer never changes no matter how hard I pray
Cause for me this is love is real, but for him it’s just a normal Tuesday 

I can feel it when he kisses me sometimes, that she’s on his mind
But she says she’s over him, so maybe I’ve got time 
To show him how much I’d give anything for him, if he’d just be mine

I know exactly what he’s using me for
Yet here am I again right outside his door
Cause if I just be patient, if I just be kind
He will realize that he loves me and it’ll be just fine

For now I just gotta keep on loving him, til he finally heals
Right now I just gotta keep loving him no matter how painful it feels
Cause I just know soon he will see me
Want me need me

For now I cling to what he gives me, late at night 
Cause those late nights in his bed they feel just right 
It’s the morning after when he has to go, I can feel my heart breaking 
When his attitude turns cold

But I can’t blame him yet
It’s because of her that he’s upset 
She’s what he really wants 
Right now I’m the best that he can get 

Time goes by, and my love only grows 
Why can’t he see how I am feeling?
Can he really not know? 
Or does he see how much I need him?
Surely soon he will see the love singing out of me, like a Sunday morning hymn

And he will realize that what I have to offer is worth more than she could ever be
Please baby, please see, it’s time to choose me


But that’s not how those story ends, with a fairy tale kiss
I should have seen how this would end for me, definitely not in bliss
Cause I love a man who only wants me for one thing 
And no matter how hard I love him, his views remain unchanged 

Friends. With benefits that benefit him. 
But don’t tell anyone it’s our secret and only after 10pm.
At this point I crave any scraps of his attention 
So here I am again 

Right outside his door my heart in hands but tonight he’s not here alone, 
He forgot we had plans 
And looking through the window I see what he sees
 She’s wrapped up in his arms, he doesn’t even miss me

She agreed to try again, to forgive and forget 
Why, why hasn’t he seen the value of me and my heart yet? 
It’s been almost a year, how long will it take? 
I need him to pick me, cause without him my heart will break

But he didn’t choose me. And now I’m lying here alone, so broken I can barely breathe 
Cause no matter how much I love him
I couldn’t make him stay 

He only ever wanted me for one thing, my touch not my love 
And now I am left to wonder why wasn’t my love good enough? 

Is she prettier than me? Surely that must be it. 
It’s okay I can fix that, just gotta cut my hair and lose this weight. 
Then he will see I’m the one he really wants and by my side he’ll stay

My new look caught attention from everyone in town, 
Hey are you okay? You’re really slimming down. 
Oh yes I’m fine I tell them, as my body starts to shrink 
But don’t worry, I know it’ll change the way he thinks 

He will realize I can be slim too,
 and after all this I can fill her shoes 
And her Cinderella shoes

He texted me today. I could barely believe my eyes! 
Surely he’s finally noticed I’m meant to be his bride
Hey, wanna come over tonight? I’m making something special for dinner, or at least I’m gonna try. We might still end up with pizza, but I’m sure it’ll be fine.

Oh wait, it wasn’t for me, an accident he said
Sorry didn’t mean to send that to you his second message read
I don’t know what to say to that, am I supposed to laugh it off? 
Instead I just ignore it, and crawl back into bed
Tears soak the pillow beneath my head

I wrack my brain again, trying to see what she has that I don’t. 
But I cannot give up now, not when I am so close, just gotta make a few more changes, I can’t give up, I won’t 

Little by little I carve away at myself, my body and my soul 
Until there’s nothing left of the old me, 
I’ve finally reached my goal

Surely now he can love me instead remodeled and transformed 
But when I tried to talk to him today, I was just ignored

I study her again and again trying to figure out what he sees
Why can he love her, why can’t he love me? 
I just gotta keep loving him, I know one day he’ll see 

And keep loving him I did, replaying every night we spent together in my head, but I was always alone in bed
And each morning when I woke from the dreams of him that filled my heart with hope, 
I’d check my phone first thing, is that text from him? Nope

Love is patient. Love is kind. 
My friends are getting worried, but I tell them I’m just fine. 
Cause I remember what I learned when’s I was small, true love always wins. I just have to love him harder, until he finally sees I am the one for him

I ran into him today, standing in store.
But when I finally approached him, he didn’t recognize me anymore 
I just have to love him harder, he will get over her, he will want me back. 
I know it in my heart, true love always wins that’s a fact

I found out she sings in the choir on Sundays. But I can do that too. 
I’ll show him just wait, I can do anything she can do 
I thought she’d be able to tell, that she’d see it on my face
But she doesn’t even realize that I used to spend my nights at their place 

I just gotta keep loving him, as hard as I possibly can. 
It’s just taking him some time, to see how worthy I really am
But I can keep on going cause my love for him is as patient as it is kind. 
All this work is quite exhausting, changing myself in every way, but it’ll all be worth it
Cause eventually he will be mine

True love always wins, I used to hear my mother say. 
So each night I bow my head it’s for him that I pray
I pray that he will see, I’m just as good as her in every way 
Please god, let today be the day 

I texted him today. Nothing crazy, just a simple hey. 
I could see that he had read it, but he must’ve had a busy day. 
I’m sure he’ll respond tomorrow. I just gotta give him time. 
Remember, I tell myself love is patient. Love is kind. 

She sits beside me now in choir, yet still doesn’t know,
 but that’s ok for now, today I wrote him a note
I poured out my love for him, page after page
Eventually  ill send it to him, but I can’t yet, I’ am not the brave

She invited me to lunch today, and for a moment I felt faint. 
Did she know finally who I am? No? 
Just a lucky twist of fate

We talked and talked for hours. She told me all about him, as if I didn’t see
Of course he’s perfect and wonderful that’s why he’s meant for me. 
But I can’t tell her that just yet,
After all we just met

She’s invited me to his place for dinner, he said he’d love to meet her new friend 
I almost feel bad for her, knowing how this story ends

Cause true love always wins. Of this I know is true. 
I’m praying hard now Lord, I need you 
I know tonight’s the night, where he will finally see
He’s not meant to be with her, he’s meant to be with me. 

She met me at the door, and ushered me inside 
“Honey” she calls out, “our guest has arrived” 
As he comes around the corner, I see his face, and he’s surprised 

Instantly I know, he must feel the love pouring from my soul to his
But he steps around me to embrace her, and gives her a gentle kiss. 

He kisses her but looks at me, his message is clear, at least to me 
His choice is her. It always will be. 
For a second I can hardly breathe, but thrue love is supposed to win. 
It’s what my mama always told me again and again 

I just have to love him harder. I just what I have to do. 
I have to prove my love to him, so he knows it true
But every time I’ve tried to show him in the past 
She’s always come in first, and I always last

I catch sight of my reflection in a mirror hanging just by the door. 
I don’t recognize the girl there anymore. 
It is that moment I knew just what I needed to do. 
It really wasn’t hard. And you’d think it would be to

Turns out it was easy, and if you’re quick about it, there’s no fight
And I was very fast when I reached down for the knife. 

As I lay there on the floor, my blood and love for him both spilling out,
I knew exactly what mama had been preaching about 
Cause true love always wins, mama died for true love too
For true love is always stronger than even mortal sin

My breathing begins to slow, and I know it’s almost time to go
I look up at him and whisper “I have always loved you, love is patient and love is kind, but now you can finally see how far my love goes for you. Now you know my love is true. And when you join me in heaven, I’ll be waiting there for you. Cause true love always wins, eventually in the very very end.”
