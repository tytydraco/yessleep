Maybe I just haven’t talked to people in a while. Maybe my social cues need an update. Or maybe Thomas is just a cold bastard now.

It was a low blow, him bringing up my mother like that back at the café. It’s not that he mentioned her, it’s why he did. He’s no different from the other jackasses I’ve worked for. Toss me a little extra cash, and suddenly they think they’ve got access to my psyche, like I’m some weapon they can wind up, aim at a target, and forget about.

They all figure it out eventually. I take a job for experience, not loyalty. The sharper I get, the cleaner the work goes, the more I can handle. That’s the game.

Now he wants to tell me some alchemist cult was involved in my mother’s death.

I remember her getting sloppy drunk one night, eyes glazed, trying to meet my gaze but letting her head hang instead. Seeing her like David Hasselhoff was bad enough. But what she said that night stuck with me.

She told me, If you ever find me with my head in the oven, question it. I’d never go that way. It hurts others. I’d make sure it only hurt me.

I wasn’t old enough to shave. I was in third grade, still reading Little House on the Prairie for language arts.

That’s what pisses me off. These idiots and their chemistry kits, these wannabe cult types, they don’t even realize the risks they’re dumping on the public. Or maybe they do.

I remember getting an Amazon package I never ordered. A week later, I saw something on the news about Chinese companies sending out ghost orders to fake legitimacy.

The seals on those warehouse boxes had imitation hexes. Cheap ones. The cloves and sage were just barely off. Not random. Like someone chose them wrong on purpose. If the trigger’s in the wax from a disposition pallet, then this Jim Bear guy has both motive and opportunity. He could’ve slipped the ingredients into outgoing shipments during the audit phase and no one would’ve blinked.

It’s too neat. Wrapped up like someone wants me to pull the string. But my mother, messed up as she was, taught me the right questions to ask.

Why pretend to use demons when it’s really science?

Why does it even matter?

Knowing won’t stop this guy.

What I do know is someone in that warehouse is experimenting on a clueless public. And anyone clever enough to catch the markings on the box? They’ll blame demons. Not logistics, not sabotage, not chemical composition. Just bad juju and bad luck.

Stores send the product back. Stores blame the warehouse. Warehouse blames the driver. Classic blame game.

But if this guy wants to play games, I play to win.

OSHA won’t show up for another week. That means I get to have a little fun. A much-needed distraction from Thomas and his bullshit.

This Jim Bear guy wants to mess with things he doesn’t understand. I’ll make him think something’s come knocking back.

I spend the next couple hours at Home Depot picking up supplies. Then I hit a local health shop to get the rest.

Once I’m back near the Air Force base, I start drawing nasty-looking symbols on a couple bottles of witch hazel. Nothing real. Just enough to spook the guy.

After that, I prep some acid-resistant epoxy. Sold in two parts. If you screw up the mix, it heats fast and solidifies even faster. Gets hot enough to feel alive. I pour Part A into a used glass candle jar. I’ll mix in Part B right before shipping.

I make sure to include one of his candles, along with a box of his sketchy sage. Then I seal it all up with one of his fake-ass sigils right on the packaging. By the time he opens it to audit, my epoxy candle will warm his wax just 7thenough to make the mold inside pop like a grenade in a gift bag.

And just to be sure he gets the message, I leave a note inside. The café’s address. A time. No threats. Just presence. Like smoke curling in from somewhere you didn’t know had fire.

Jim’s messing with the wrong town, and he got the attention of the wrong person. But now I’m worried I might’ve got the attention of someone worse.

Thomas said my cousin was leaking secrets to people I used to know. I used to be well connected. Maybe it’s time to reconnect. Let them know I’m back. Let them know I’m cleaning house. I’ll expose every last one of them for their wicked little connections.

The dark hates the light, and I’m starting to burn bright.

I won’t lie, I want to confront all of them. Kick open every door. But I need to be smart. Can’t just barge in yelling “California conspiracies” and expect anyone to take me seriously.

No, I’m going to scare them with their own tactics. Break their logic. Twist their own symbols back at them. No broken windows. No violence. Just precision.

I won’t go back to the old ways. Never again.
