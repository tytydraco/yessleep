I saw it online.

On Craigslist of all places. It captured my attention from the very instant I laid my eyes upon it; a Crown, with the seller claiming it was a family relic they were looking to be rid of. All I had to do was message them with an offer.

I loved collecting shit like this, pretty much anything shiny and old I could get my hands on. Watches from when Al Capone ran the booze trade, an obnoxious Samurai Sword from the Warlord era of Japan, a flag from the Qubec Liberation Force, collecting things I realistically shouldn't have was always appealing to me.

Two clicks, and we were talking. The seller claimed the Crown was from one of the various Kings of Swedens short lived 30 year long empire. It was sold to him by a Russian Boat Merchant and they were willing to resell it to me at the "low low cost" of 150,000 US Dollars. I did the hum drum of pretending that I could pay that.

In reality-ville, paying for this junk wasn't my job, housing it was, and I intended to house this relic just like all the rest. I began to type, asking if they'd be willing to deliver it or if I had to come to them, but then it clicked. The story wasn't matching. The description claimed this was a family relic, and now a strange third party sold it to them. Not only did I have a place to ask questions from, but also a way to question their intent and force them to come to me. I started off innocent enough.

"Wait, didn't you say this was a family relic?"

.......

12 minutes passed. I had begun pacing as I waited on a reply, and then I received three.

"Yep, not all of our relics have,,,,stayed with the family."

"I've had to recover quite a few of them."

"But if it worries you, I have ways of proving the Crowns validity :)"

I replied quickly, maybe too quickly. I looked desperate, honestly.

"And how would you do that?"

"Send me your address and I'll head over, easier to show than to tell you."

I sat there for a moment. Having a strange man over would either end one of two ways, me in a box, or getting the crown for free. I didn't know anything about how capable this guy was, and his eagerness to show me a seemingly expensive artifact seemed really weird.

But you don't look gift horses in the mouth often, gotta take em where you can.

I sent the address, and checked my drawer to make sure I still had my gun. This'd be quick, just like last time and before that. Just gotta get over the smell. Couldn't hardly go in the basement anymore after getting that Bronze Star from the last client.

A Half Hour went by, and now I had a stranger in my living room.

This guy looked \*strange\*, and I've seen some weirdos. I sized him up.

5'8, maybe 10. Didn't have a inch of skin showing besides a small square above the nose where I could see his eyes and forehead, carried a briefcase nearly the size of his torso, and wouldn't break eye contact with me if it'd save his life. But, I guess it wouldn't. Funny.

We made all the small talk normal people did, even though it was obvious we were both hiding something. He asked about the game last week, I told him I was hoping Magic would win the playoff. He laughed and told me they didn't stand a chance against the Cavs. I asked to see what was in the case.

"Hit a nerve?" He asked.

"Nah, just want to move things along. Busy later today."

"Well then let me show you the Crown."

The briefcase opened, and it looked just about how you'd expect. Dirty, covered in grime and rust, and probably horribly fragile. I got scammed, go figures. At least I could let him leave.

"You don't seem impressed, wanna try it on?"

"And get tetanus? No thanks."

"Give it a try, no point writing it off from a glance."

He set the Crown on my coffee table, and against all normalcy and logic, I picked it up and went to sit it on my head. He stared at me harder than before, like way harder.

The Crown went on.

And the seller wasn't there anymore. No imprint, nothing, as if he never even existed. It felt like I had just woken up from a car nap. My neck hurt, my shoulders ached, and I felt groggier than I ever had before.

I got up and walked into my Kitchen, only to see that my house seemed to stop at my living room. There was a large dark void where the Kitchen used to be. I panicked and realized the salesman never even asked about my money.

I booked it to my office, only to see that all the drawers were emptied and everything in my collection was gone. I looked for the gun, but couldn't find it anywhere. Thats when I realized that all my stuff being gone wasn't the only issue with the room. There was a body in my chair. I spun the chair around, and my blood went cold.

It was me, with a nice hole where my brain would usually be.

So that's how I die? Robbed and murdered by a weirdo because of my ego? Because I thought I had him?

  
Bullshit. I had to be dreaming. I was better than this, way better. I pinched myself, nothing, and then I scratched my head and felt it.

  
I was still wearing the crown.

  
I began to pry it off, it felt like a impossible task, it felt almost bolted to my head, simply a part of my skull going forward. But as I tugged and pulled, I could feel the Crown slipping off as blood poured down my head around it. I kept wrenching through the pain, and threw it on the floor.

  
And then I was back on the couch, in front of the salesman. in front of the coffee table with the crown still on it.

  
"Told you it works."

  
He smiled wider than I had ever seen before. The mask from before was gone, figuratively and literally.

  
"And now that we're on an even playing field, I hope you'll be smart and not use that gun from your office on me. I knew from the moment you messaged me what your intentions were."

  
He continued, while standing up

"You disgust me. I'll relish this."

  
And I blacked out.  
I've only woke up recently, in a dark room that I haven't been able to make much sense of. It feels impossibly large, and yet so claustrophobic. I don't know how long its been. 

Sometimes I get to eat from a tray they slide under what I assume is the door. I spend most of my time besides that sleeping, but all I see is the Crown, my punishment made manifest. 

  
I think I'm gonna be here for a while.

  
Maybe thats for the best. People like me shouldn't chase after what we can't understand.
