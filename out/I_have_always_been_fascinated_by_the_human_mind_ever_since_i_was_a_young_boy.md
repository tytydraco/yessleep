I had always been fascinated by the human mind, ever since I was a young boy

I had always been fascinated by the human mind, ever since I was a young boy. I would read books on psychology and neuroscience, and conduct experiments on myself and my friends. I dreamed of becoming a famous scientist, and discovering the secrets of consciousness. I pursued my passion and earned a PhD in cognitive neuroscience. I got a job at a prestigious research institute, where I had access to the latest technology and equipment. 

I decided to focus my research on memory, and how it could be manipulated. I developed a device that could record and erase memories, and transfer them from one person to another. I tested it on rats and monkeys, and was amazed by the results. I wanted to try it on humans, but I knew that would be unethical and illegal. I needed a volunteer, someone who would be willing to participate in my experiment.

I found one in my girlfriend, who was also a scientist. She loved me and trusted me, and shared my curiosity for the unknown. She agreed to let me use the device on her, as long as I promised to be careful and not harm her. I assured her that I would, and that I would only erase some minor memories, like what she had for breakfast or where she parked her car. I said it would be fun and exciting, like a game. 

She agreed, and we set up the device in my lab. I attached electrodes to her head, and connected them to a computer. I asked her to recall some memories, and watched them on the screen. 

They were beautiful memories, full of color and emotion. They made me feel closer to her. I selected one of them, and pressed a button. The memory vanished from her mind.

She felt a slight headache, but nothing else. She smiled at me, and asked what I had done.

"I erased one of your memories," I said.

"Which one?" she asked.

"It doesn't matter," I said. "It was something trivial."

I pressed another button, and transferred the memory to my own mind. I saw what she had seen: a sunny day at the park, where we had gone for a picnic. We had laughed and kissed under a tree. It was a happy memory.

I smiled back at her, and said I loved her.

"I love you too," she said.

I felt a surge of joy and affection for her. She was perfect for me. She understood me like no one else did. She was my soulmate.

I repeated the process several times, erasing more of her memories, and transferring them to my own mind. I saw more of our moments together: our first date, our first kiss, our first time making love. I felt a surge of joy and affection for her.

She felt more confused and disoriented each time. She started to forget who i was, and why she was there. She asked me to stop, but i ignored her.

I became obsessed with her memories, and wanted to have them all for himself. He erased everything that made her who she was: her name, her family, and her friends. 

I felt guilty, but also curious. I wondered what else i could do with the device. I decided to erase another memory, and transfer it to myself. I repeated the process, and saw another scene from our relationship: a night at the movies, where we had watched a comedy and cuddled in the dark. I felt another wave of affection, and also a pang of regret.

I looked at her, and saw that she was still smiling. She didn’t seem to notice anything wrong. She asked me to do it again, and I obliged. I erased another memory, and transferred it to myself. 

I saw another moment of our love: a trip to the beach, where we had swum in the ocean and built a sandcastle. I felt another jolt of joy, and also a twinge of remorse. I realized that i was becoming addicted to her memories. I wanted to experience them all, to relive our happiness. I also realized that I was hurting her, that i was taking away parts of her identity. 

I knew i should stop, but i couldn’t. I erased another memory, and transferred it to myself. I saw another glimpse of our bliss: a dinner at a fancy restaurant, where we had celebrated our seventh anniversary. I felt another burst of love, and also a stab of guilt.

I looked at her again, and saw that she was still smiling. But her smile was different. It was empty and hollow. She didn’t recognize me anymore. She asked me who i was, and what i was doing to her.

I felt a shock of horror, and realized that i had gone too far. I had erased all of her memories of me, and transferred them to myself. I had destroyed their relationship, and ruined her life.
I tried to undo what he had done, but it was too late. The device had malfunctioned, and the memories were gone forever. I couldn’t give them back to her, or erase them from his own mind. I broke down in tears, and apologized to her. But she didn’t understand me. She didn’t know me.

I have always been fascinated by the human mind, ever since i was a young boy.

But now I wished I had never touched it.
