I’ve moved every six months for as long as I can remember. My parents’ work demanded it, they said. New projects, new places, and a new home every half-year. It became routine: new schools, new faces, new lies about why we were constantly uprooted. By the time I turned sixteen, it wasn’t just exhausting—it was suffocating. I was trapped in a never-ending cycle of boxes, highways, and unfamiliar houses. 

The latest move was to a small, out-of-the-way town called Hollow Creek in Kansas. It wasn’t on any maps I could find online, almost like it didn’t exist until you were there. The roads were winding, cutting through dense woods that seemed to close in on you the further you went. Our new house sat at the very end of Elm Street, a Victorian structure with peeling paint and a sagging roof, shrouded by gnarled trees that blocked out the sun.

The moment I walked inside, I felt it: a coldness that sank into my bones. The house smelled like damp earth, old wood, and something else—something metallic, like blood left to rust. My parents—if that’s what they really were—seemed unfazed. They were too busy unpacking to notice the way the shadows seemed to move on their own, flickering just at the edge of my vision.

The first night, I barely slept. Every room seemed to hum with a low, persistent noise, like distant whispers just beyond hearing. My bedroom window rattled in its frame, despite the absence of any wind. Around midnight, I thought I heard footsteps shuffling in the hallway. I opened the door, but there was nothing—just darkness and the lingering scent of something sweet, like decaying flowers.

The next day, school was its own kind of nightmare. I was used to being the new kid, but Hollow Creek High was different. The students were friendly, overly so, their smiles stretched too wide, their eyes too empty. They watched me like I was some rare exhibit on display. Even the teachers seemed off, their voices flat, reciting lessons as if they were reading from a script. There was no life in this place, only a hollow echo of normalcy.

Jesse was the only one who approached me. Skinny, pale, with a shock of red hair that fell into his sunken eyes, Jesse seemed just as out of place as I felt. He sat next to me in math class, doodling strange symbols in the margins of his notebook—circles, jagged lines, shapes that looked like they belonged in an ancient book. 

“You live in the McClellan house, don’t you?” he asked one day, his voice low, almost conspiratorial.

“Yeah, why?” I replied, trying to sound casual.

He hesitated, glancing around before leaning in. “People say that house is cursed. Families move in, but they never stay long. Weird things happen there. People hear… things.”

I laughed it off, but the way he said it stuck with me. That night, lying in bed, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. I stared at the ceiling, counting the cracks that resembled twisted, leering faces, and tried to ignore the faint noise of whispering coming from the walls. 

Over the next few weeks, the strange occurrences escalated. My belongings started to disappear and reappear in different places—my toothbrush in the fridge, my shoes in the bathtub. I’d wake up in the middle of the night to find my bedroom door wide open, though I was sure I had locked it. Once, I woke to find muddy footprints leading from the basement door to the foot of my bed. My parents just shrugged it off, dismissing it all as my overactive imagination. But I knew better.

Hollow Creek itself felt like it was rotting from the inside out. The townspeople were too cheerful, too perfect, as if they were wearing masks. Every evening, they’d gather in the town square, laughing and chatting, but their voices were all wrong—too smooth, too rehearsed. It was like watching actors who’d forgotten how to be human. The children played games in the streets, their laughter a high-pitched, unsettling symphony that echoed long after they were gone.

I tried to talk to Jesse about it, but he always changed the subject, his eyes darting around like he was scared of being overheard. One afternoon, he pulled me aside behind the gym. “Don’t trust anyone,” he whispered urgently. “They’re all in on it. They have to be.”

“What are you talking about?” I asked, but he just shook his head and walked away, leaving me more confused than ever.

One night, unable to sleep, I decided to explore the house. My parents were in their room, speaking in hushed tones. I crept down the hallway and stopped outside their door, listening. I could only make out bits and pieces—something about “the right time” and “preparing the offering.” Their voices were strange, almost inhuman, like they were speaking in unison. I backed away, my heart pounding, and found myself standing in front of the basement door.

The basement had been off-limits since we moved in. My parents always kept it locked, saying it was unsafe, full of old junk and rotting wood. But that night, the door was slightly ajar, a sliver of darkness that seemed to beckon me in. I hesitated, then pushed it open, the creak echoing like a scream. 

The basement was colder than the rest of the house, the air thick with a stench that made my stomach churn. In the dim light, I saw more of those strange symbols etched into the walls, glowing faintly as if they were alive. In the center of the room stood an altar, crudely fashioned from stone and covered in dark stains. Surrounding it were old, rotting dolls, their faces twisted into grotesque smiles, their eyes painted a deep, unnatural red.

I felt a sudden urge to leave, but something caught my eye—a small, leather-bound book resting on the altar. I picked it up, my hands trembling. The pages were filled with strange, unreadable symbols, but one thing stood out: drawings of people, sketched in frantic, desperate strokes. Some were hanging from trees, others kneeling before the altar, surrounded by figures in dark robes. One of the drawings showed a child, bound and gagged, lying on the altar with shadowy figures hovering over them.

I turned to leave, and that’s when I saw them—my parents, standing at the top of the stairs, their faces bathed in shadow. I expected anger, but instead, they just stared at me, their expressions blank, empty.

“You shouldn’t be down here,” my father said, his voice devoid of emotion.

My mother stepped forward, smiling that too-wide smile. “Come on, dear. It’s late. You need your rest.”

They escorted me back to my room, tucking me in like I was a child again. I lay there, paralyzed, pretending to sleep as they stood over me, whispering in a language I didn’t understand. I kept my eyes shut until I heard the door click shut, then bolted up and locked it from the inside. I didn’t sleep the rest of the night.

The next day, Jesse wasn’t at school. His desk sat empty, his backpack still hanging from his chair. I asked around, but no one seemed to know—or care—where he’d gone. That afternoon, I went back to the house and searched for him, but there was no sign of Jesse. Only the town kept moving, the people smiling their empty smiles, as if nothing had happened.

Then came the night of the festival. Hollow Creek’s Summer Solstice was a big event, the townspeople said, a time to celebrate the season and give thanks. My parents were oddly excited, dressing me in formal clothes and urging me to join them in the town square. I had no choice but to follow, though every instinct screamed at me to run. 

The square was packed, a sea of faces lit by the flickering glow of torches. There was something off about the way the people moved—too synchronized, too rehearsed. At the center of the square was a stage, draped in black cloth. My parents led me to the front, right as the Mayor took the stage, dressed in ceremonial robes that looked older than the town itself.

“Tonight, we honor our traditions,” he announced, his voice booming through the crowd. “We give thanks to the old ways and renew our bond with the ancient ones.”

The crowd erupted in cheers, their faces twisted with feverish excitement. I tried to back away, but my parents’ grip tightened on my shoulders. I was trapped. The Mayor’s eyes fell on me, and he smiled—a slow, knowing grin that sent a chill down my spine.

“Bring forth the offering,” he said, and the crowd parted.

Jesse was dragged onto the stage, bound and gagged, his eyes wide with terror. He struggled against his captors, but they held him firm, forcing him to kneel before the altar. I tried to scream, to move, but my parents held me in place, their expressions eerily calm.

“This is how it must be,” my father whispered in my ear. “We must keep the cycle going.”

The chanting began, low and rhythmic, rising in intensity as the townspeople swayed in unison. The Mayor raised a blade, and I saw the same symbols carved into its surface, glowing with an otherworldly light. I knew I had to get out

The chanting began, low and rhythmic, rising in intensity as the townspeople swayed in unison. The Mayor raised a blade, and I saw the same symbols carved into its surface, glowing with an otherworldly light. I knew I had to get out—right then, or I’d be next.

I wrenched free from my parents’ grip, their fingers clawing at my jacket as I stumbled backward. The crowd turned toward me, their blank, hollow eyes staring. I bolted, shoving past the throng of bodies, and ran blindly through the town, the twisted sounds of chanting and laughter echoing in my ears. 

I sprinted down darkened streets, past houses that all looked the same—rotting facades with lifeless windows. My heart pounded as I turned onto the highway, each step pushing me farther from Hollow Creek. I didn’t look back. I couldn’t. I ran until my legs burned, until my throat felt raw from the cold night air.

A set of headlights appeared in the distance, slowly growing brighter. I flagged down the approaching truck, my mind racing with desperate plans. The driver, an older man with graying hair and a weary look in his eyes, slowed and rolled down the window.

“Need a lift, kid?” he asked, eyeing me with a mix of suspicion and pity.

“Please,” I gasped, tears stinging my eyes. “I need to get away from here.”

He nodded, his gaze shifting to the distant glow of Hollow Creek. “Get in.”

I climbed into the cab, shivering uncontrollably. The truck rumbled back to life, pulling away from the town as I watched the lights of Hollow Creek fade into the darkness behind us. The driver didn’t ask many questions, and I was too shaken to volunteer much. All I could think of was getting to my grandparents, the only people who might help me make sense of what was happening.

We drove for hours through the night, the landscape slowly transforming from dense forests to open fields. I drifted in and out of a restless sleep, haunted by visions of Jesse on the altar and my parents’ empty, unfeeling eyes. By dawn, we reached the outskirts of a quiet town in Missouri where my grandparents lived. I thanked the driver, who gave me a sympathetic nod before driving off, leaving me alone on the familiar street that led to their house.

I stumbled up the front steps and pounded on the door, my fists trembling. It swung open, and there they were—Grandma and Grandpa, looking just as I remembered, with warm smiles and open arms. For a moment, I felt safe, as if I had finally escaped the nightmare of Hollow Creek.

But something was off. The way they smiled at me—too wide, too perfect. I tried to shake it off as paranoia, but the unease lingered. I poured out the whole story, my voice breaking as I described the festival, the altar, and how I ran away. My grandparents listened intently, their expressions never changing, as if they already knew every word I was going to say.

“We’re glad you came to us, dear,” Grandma said, her voice soothing yet strangely hollow. “You’ve been through so much.”

I nodded, tears welling up, relieved to be away from that cursed town. Grandpa made me tea, the familiar scent filling the kitchen. But when I took a sip, it tasted bitter—like dirt and something foul. I looked up, and they were watching me, their smiles never faltering.

“You must be exhausted,” Grandpa said, patting my shoulder with an unnervingly gentle touch. “It’s time you rest.”

Something clicked then—a realization that twisted my stomach. The house felt wrong, too pristine, like a staged set, and the way they moved was just like the people in Hollow Creek: synchronized, rehearsed, almost mechanical. I glanced around the room, my eyes falling on the walls. 

There, faint but unmistakable, were those symbols—the same ones I’d seen in the basement and on the Mayor’s blade. I stumbled back, the room spinning. They were everywhere, hidden in the intricate floral wallpaper, etched into the frames of old family photos. I felt sick.

“We’re so proud of you,” Grandma whispered, her voice taking on that same eerie, unified tone I’d heard my parents use. “You’ve finally come home.”

I backed away, panic surging through me as I realized the truth: my escape was just another part of the plan, a carefully crafted illusion to lead me right where they wanted. The cult wasn’t just in Hollow Creek—it was everywhere. It was in my blood, in my family. My parents, my grandparents, all of them were part of this monstrous tradition, and I was the next offering.

I turned and bolted for the door, but Grandpa’s grip was iron as he grabbed my arm, pulling me back with inhuman strength. I screamed, thrashing as they dragged me toward the back room, my cries echoing uselessly against the walls adorned with symbols of their twisted faith. The last thing I saw before the darkness swallowed me was their faces, smiling too wide, their eyes gleaming with ancient, unholy purpose.

And then, there was only the chanting.

I woke up gasping, drenched in cold sweat, but this wasn’t a nightmare I could wake from. My wrists and ankles were bound tightly to the bed with thick ropes that dug into my skin, each tug sending sharp pain shooting through my body. I blinked rapidly, disoriented, my eyes struggling to adjust to the dim, flickering light of my bedroom. I knew immediately—this wasn’t right. This wasn’t where I was supposed to be.

The door creaked open, and they stepped inside—my parents, my grandparents, all moving together in eerie silence. They stared down at me with expressions that weren’t quite human, their eyes glinting with a strange, sinister light. It was like I was nothing more than an insect pinned down for their sick amusement.

“You’re safe, sweetheart,” my mom whispered, her voice soft but unnervingly calm. She stroked my cheek with icy fingers, her touch sending chills down my spine. “We’re here to help you.”

“Why are you doing this?” I choked, my voice breaking. Tears welled up, blurring my vision as I pulled against the restraints. “Let me go!”

Dad sat at the foot of the bed, his head tilted in that peculiar way that always made me feel uneasy, even before I knew the truth. “You don’t understand yet,” he said quietly. “But you will. We’re here to protect you. To keep you where you belong.”

My grandparents moved closer, their faces twisted in unnatural, joyless smiles. They began to whisper, low and rhythmic, their words blending into an ominous chant that sent a jolt of dread through my core. The chanting was soft at first, a hypnotic murmur that rose and fell like waves crashing against the shore, but it grew louder, more frenzied, each syllable tinged with a dark, otherworldly resonance.

I thrashed against the ropes, feeling them cut deeper into my skin. The chanting surrounded me, pressing in on all sides, growing louder and more insistent, like it was clawing its way into my mind. It was a language I couldn’t understand, yet every word felt heavy with malice, laced with a sickening sense of inevitability. They were performing some kind of ritual—a ritual with me at its center.

“No!” I screamed, my voice raw with terror. I fought against the ropes with renewed desperation, twisting and writhing until my right hand slipped free. My fingers trembled as I reached for the knife on the nightstand, grabbing it just as my parents lunged at me. I swung wildly, the blade slashing through the air, narrowly missing my father’s throat. 

“Stop fighting!” Mom shrieked, her voice losing its sweet facade and twisting into something monstrous. “You’re one of us! You belong to us!”

I cut through the ropes with frantic swipes, freeing myself from the bed just as my grandparents grabbed for me. Grandma’s hands clamped around my neck, her grip surprisingly strong, and I could see the madness in her eyes—the same madness I’d seen in everyone in this cursed town. I shoved her away, sending her crashing into the dresser. The room erupted into chaos as I fought them all off, the knife flashing in my hand.

Blood sprayed across the walls, and their screams filled the air, mingling with the relentless chanting that echoed inside my head. I swung the knife blindly, my vision blurred by tears and fury. I stabbed and slashed until the room fell silent, leaving only the sound of my ragged breathing and the rhythmic drip of blood pooling on the floor.

They were dead. All of them. My parents. My grandparents. The people who had lied to me, used me, betrayed me. I stood amidst the carnage, the knife slipping from my shaking hands. My chest heaved as I stared at the twisted bodies, the realization of what I’d done crashing over me like a tidal wave. I’d killed them, but in their eyes, even in death, they were still smiling, as if they’d won.

The distant sound of sirens wailed through the night, growing louder, closer. Red and blue lights flashed outside, casting eerie shadows that danced across the walls. I staggered to the window, my vision swimming as police cars pulled up to the house. They were coming for me. I had no time to think, no time to run. I just sank to the floor, my body trembling, my mind splintering under the weight of everything that had happened.

Later, I found myself in the back of a police cruiser, my wrists cuffed and my clothes soaked in blood. I watched from behind the glass as they swarmed the house, officers moving in and out like insects drawn to a corpse. They looked at me with a mixture of horror and pity, but none of them would ever understand. No one would. 

I was just another headline now, another tragedy for the evening news. The TV in the holding cell flickered on, showing a breaking news segment about the grisly scene at my house. My face filled the screen, pale and haunted, accompanied by words like "disturbed" and "unthinkable." I stared at the image, feeling like I was looking at a stranger—someone trapped in a nightmare they couldn’t escape.

The news anchor’s voice cut through the static. She was a polished woman with a crisp, professional tone, her smile bright and cheerful in the way that always felt fake. “Tonight, a small town is reeling after a teenage boy brutally murdered his parents and grandparents. The motive remains a mystery, but authorities describe the scene as something out of a horror movie.”

As she spoke, I watched her smile, but something about it was wrong. It was too wide, too sharp. Her eyes gleamed with an unsettling darkness, and I felt a shiver of recognition. She wasn’t just reporting the news—she was reveling in it. She knew. I could hear it in her voice, the same rhythmic cadence as the chants that still echoed in my mind. 

“The investigation is ongoing,” she continued, her voice dripping with false sincerity. “But we urge our viewers to stay safe and to always trust those closest to you.”

Then she did it. A slow, deliberate wink at the camera, her smile stretching impossibly wide. It was like she was staring straight at me, mocking me. I couldn’t breathe. My stomach churned as I realized that the cult wasn’t just my parents or the people in the town—it was everywhere. They were everywhere. The news anchor, the neighbors, the strangers on the street. 

The cult had spread like a disease, infecting everyone, turning them into smiling, hollow shells of who they once were. There was no escaping it. They were in the air I breathed, the food I ate, the faces of those I once trusted. And now, even in the cold, sterile walls of my cell, I couldn’t escape their eyes.

I curled up on the floor, burying my face in my hands as the anchor’s voice droned on, her words echoing in my skull. The horror wasn’t just what I’d done—it was knowing that no matter where I went, they would always find me. I was trapped in their web, just another victim in an endless cycle of horror.

And as the screen flickered, the anchor’s smile seemed to grow, filling the tiny room with a suffocating presence. I screamed, but no one heard. I was alone, surrounded by smiling faces, trapped in a world that was never really mine.

They were always watching. And now, there was no way out.
