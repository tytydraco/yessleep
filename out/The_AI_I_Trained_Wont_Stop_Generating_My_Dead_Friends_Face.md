I haven’t told anyone else. Who would believe me? “An AI is haunted by your dead friend?” They’d laugh me off the internet.

But I’m not laughing.

Because it’s been two years since Max died. And somehow, he keeps showing up in every image I generate.

It started as nothing more than a way to kill time. I’d been messing around with an AI image generator for a few weeks, the kind you feed random prompts into, and it spits out art that looks almost human-made. Sometimes the results are beautiful. Sometimes they’re funny. Sometimes they’re nightmare fuel by accident.

I liked testing its limits. I’d ask it for impossible things, like “a fish playing a guitar underwater in the style of Van Gogh” or “a city floating on clouds lit by candlelight.” The machine didn’t care—it always gave me something.

But then, one evening, I typed in something simple: “an empty street at night.”

The result looked fine at first. A narrow road, dim lamps glowing, shadows curling at the edges. But in the bottom corner, blurred, half-hidden behind a pole—there was a figure.

A pale face.

And not just any face.

Max’s.

I remember leaning forward, squinting at the screen, telling myself I was imagining things. People see patterns everywhere. Faces in clouds, monsters in wood grain. This was the same, right?

But the longer I stared, the more sure I became. The crooked nose, the way his hair fell across his forehead, the shadow of a smile. It wasn’t just similar.

It was him.

Who Max Was
I should back up.

Max was my best friend. We grew up together, the kind of friendship that feels stitched into your bones. We spent summers building forts, winters huddled over video games, late nights sharing secrets we never told anyone else.

And then, two years ago, he died.

Car crash. Sudden. Brutal. The kind of death that doesn’t give you time to prepare or say goodbye. One second he was there, the next he was gone.

I went to the funeral in a daze, not believing the box in the ground contained the person who’d once laughed so hard he cried at my stupid jokes. For months afterward, I caught myself reaching for my phone to text him, only to remember.

I never really got over it.

So when his face showed up in that AI render, my first thought wasn’t horror. It was grief. A sharp, twisting ache. Like the machine had dug up a ghost I’d spent two years trying to bury.


I told myself it was a glitch. AI pulls fragments from millions of images online. Maybe it found someone who looked eerily similar.

But the next day, I tried again. Different prompt this time: “a busy New York street.”

The image popped up. Neon signs, crowds of people, cars streaming past.

And there, in the crowd, half-turned toward me, was Max.

Not blurry this time.

Clear.

I stared at him. He was in the middle of the sidewalk, dressed in clothes he never wore in life—dark hoodie, pale jeans—but the face was his. The same lopsided grin. The same eyes.

And the worst part?

He was looking straight at me.

Everyone else in the image was walking, heads turned in different directions, blurred with motion. But not him. He was facing the camera, still and sharp.

Facing me.


I shut the laptop. Walked away. Told myself I was tired, seeing things.

But I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

Later that night, I opened the program again. Typed another random prompt: “a medieval knight in armor.”

The knight appeared. Detailed, shining armor, sword at his side. And reflected faintly in the sword’s blade—

Max.

This time his expression had changed. The grin was gone. His mouth was too wide, stretching wrong, twisted into something that looked almost painful. His eyes were darker, emptier.

I closed the program. Deleted my search history. Told myself I was done with it.

But of course, I wasn’t.


Over the next week, I kept testing it. Telling myself I needed to know.

“A dog chasing a ball.”

Max’s face, blurred in the grass.

“A bowl of fruit.”

Max, reflected in the glass of a wine bottle.

“The ocean at sunset.”

Max, standing on the shore, half-drowned, skin pale.

It didn’t matter what I typed. He always showed up.

At first it was small—corners, reflections, background shapes. But then it grew. He got closer. More visible. More detailed.

Until one night, I typed: “a classroom with empty desks.”

The image loaded.

And he was sitting in the front row.

Full body. Perfectly clear.

Smiling.


That was the first time I noticed text.

AI generators don’t usually add words. Not unless you ask. But at the bottom of the picture, scribbled like handwriting, was a single sentence.

“I’m not gone.”

I froze. My stomach dropped.

I hadn’t typed that. I hadn’t asked for words.

I shut the laptop again, hands shaking. Sat in the dark, listening to my own breathing.

For the first time, I wondered if it wasn’t just grief. If this wasn’t just coincidence.

If something was wrong.


That brings me to now.

I’ve been writing this out, trying to make sense of it, hoping that putting it into words will make it sound less insane.

But just now, while typing, I noticed something.

The mirror across the room.

There’s movement in it. A pale shape, standing where I’m sitting, grinning as I type.

I don’t dare look up.

But the reflection is smiling wider.

I should have left the mirror alone. I should have thrown a blanket over it, turned it to face the wall, smashed it if I had to.

But I didn’t.

I forced myself to look up.

At first, nothing. Just my room, lit by the pale glow of the monitor. My reflection slumped in the chair, face pale and drawn.

And behind me…

Empty.

But then the reflection smiled.

Not me. Not my mouth. My lips were pressed tight, breath shallow, chest tight with fear. But in the glass, my reflection grinned, lips curling too wide, teeth too sharp.

And I swear—though the glass was thin and cheap—I heard the faint scrape of laughter. Like nails dragged across metal.

I grabbed the mirror, yanked it from the wall, and shoved it face-down under my bed. The sound cut off instantly, but my heart wouldn’t stop pounding.

That night, I slept with the lights on.


The next day, I tried to tell myself it was stress. Lack of sleep. I’d been pulling too many late nights with the AI, obsessing over things no one else cared about. Maybe I was hallucinating.

I avoided the program all morning. Forced myself to go outside. Walked aimlessly through the neighborhood, listening to the crunch of leaves under my shoes.

It should’ve been normal. Comforting.

But everywhere I looked, I saw him.

A man walking his dog—same tilt of the head as Max. A kid riding his bike—same crooked grin. A car passed, and for a split second, in the driver’s seat, I thought I saw his eyes staring back at me.

I shook it off. Went home.

But when I stepped inside, my phone buzzed.

1 New Notification.

It was from the AI app. I hadn’t opened it. I hadn’t touched it since the night before.

The notification just said:

“You left me waiting.”

I deleted the app. Or at least, I thought I did.

Because an hour later, when I booted up my laptop to distract myself with YouTube, the program launched on its own.

Prompt box open. Cursor blinking.

Waiting.

I didn’t type anything. Didn’t move the mouse.

But text started appearing anyway. Slowly, one letter at a time.

H
E
L
L
O

My chest tightened.

Then another word:

MAX


I slammed the laptop shut again. Told myself it was a virus. A prank. Something explainable.

But later that night, while brushing my teeth, I got another notification. This time, it wasn’t a message.

It was a photo.

Taken from my laptop’s webcam.

Me, sitting at the desk, face pale, eyes wide.

And behind me—leaning over my shoulder, smiling with his teeth bared—was Max.

I dropped my phone. It clattered against the sink, cracked the case. My hands shook so bad I could barely pick it up again.

I didn’t sleep at all.


By the next morning, I couldn’t take it anymore. I needed answers.

So I went to the cemetery.

It had been months since I’d visited. Guilt twisted in my gut as I walked up the path. The October air was sharp, the trees half-bare, dead leaves scattered like bones across the ground.

I found his grave easily. The headstone was small, plain. His name carved into it.

Maxwell Black.
2006 – 2023.

I stood there for a long time, staring at the stone, whispering apologies under my breath.

But then—

A voice.

Not out loud. Not in my ears.

In my head.

“I’m still here.”

I froze. Looked around. No one. The cemetery was empty.

But the voice came again, stronger.

“You left me. You stopped visiting. You forgot me.”

I shook my head. “No,” I whispered. “I never forgot you.”

The ground under the grave shifted. Just slightly. The soil darkened, pulsing like something alive was buried beneath.

And in that moment, I realized something that made my blood run cold.

The AI wasn’t just pulling his face from data.

It was him.

He was in there.

And he wanted out.


I ran home. Slammed the door. Locked it.

But my laptop was already open, glowing.

On the screen, a new image.

Not one I’d prompted. Not one I wanted.

It was my room. Perfectly rendered. Desk, chair, bed.

And sitting in the chair—

Max.

Head tilted. Smile sharp. Eyes hollow.

And beneath the image, more text, scribbled like it had been carved into the screen itself:

“Let me in.”


I don’t know what to do anymore. Deleting the app doesn’t help. Smashing the laptop won’t help—I know, deep down, he’s already inside.

Every reflection, every shadow, every screen.

Max is there.

And he’s getting closer.

Right now, as I type this, my webcam light just flicked on by itself.

I don’t dare look.

But I can feel his breath on my neck
