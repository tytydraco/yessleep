My therapist/priest said I should write down what happened to me. He said it’d help with my therapy and hopefully help me get to a place in life where I can become self-dependent again. He also said that sharing my story with others could help validate my feelings, and help me see that what happened wasn’t my fault. So, I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone and just post it here. There's a lot to my story so I'm going to have to split it into two parts.



For you to fully understand my story, I need to give some background. To start, my name is Grayson Miller and I’m 25 years old. \*From around the time I was 17 I had begun sleepwalking. It had never been bad though, mostly I would wake up standing in front of the fridge or in the bathroom. Until about two months after my brother went missing, I woke up outside on my front lawn.\* The town I live in (which is a small town in rural South Dakota) has a system of tunnels that run underneath the city. It mostly consists of smaller drainage tunnels (about 3 x 3 feet), but where all these tunnels eventually meet up forms a single large tunnel. This main tunnel spans about 2 miles in a single direction, and is about 7 x 10 feet. This tunnel is called “The Sheep Tunnel”. It was given this name because this used to be the tunnel that local farmers would use to bypass the town's streets while transporting their sheep to and from the nearby mountains (near Black Elk Peak, if you know where that is). But now it’s filled with graffiti and trash. The local teens and college students often visit this tunnel as a sort of “test of courage”. I myself have been here with friends several times in highschool for similar reasons. Though, one unspoken rule of the tunnels is that you never visit by yourself. Not because the tunnels themselves are a danger; the people who are rumored to use them are.



When I was in highschool, my younger brother, Barry Miller, went missing when he was dared to walk the length of the Sheep Tunnel alone. When Barry never showed up at the other end, his friends became worried and notified the police. Despite countless hours of searching, no one was able to find him. About two months after he was reported missing, a group of college students stumbled across his body. Barry was found at the main entrance of the Sheep Tunnel, a couple yards back from the opening. He was completely dismembered. The body was positioned on a small wooden platform and “decorated” around a tall wooden stake coming up from the middle of the platform. Based on the color of the blood and the state the flesh was in, it was apparent that Barry was recently deceased. The head was removed from the neck and put into an incision just below the rib cage, so that the face of the head jutted out, replacing the stomach. Sticking out from around the head were the small and large intestine, cut into strands, as if they were vines dangling off a long forgotten statue. The arms were also taken from their sockets and inserted in different locations on the torso. His right arm stuck out from his back and was positioned in a way that made it look like the hand was receiving a gift. His left arm was inserted in a hole where the left trapezius should have been. The arm bent over the neck and came down the front of the chest. The hand was positioned with the pointer finger, the middle finger, and the thumb all extended pointing down towards the ground; palm facing out. Both of the legs were removed from the hip joint and were wrapped around the waist, as if they were a belt; the feet were covered in blood. There was also a passage, of sorts, written on the wall next to the “sculpture”. It read:



 "Verily, I say unto thee, appeasel of our God in this

Mortal realm is nigh unto impossible to attain. 

Yet, through the might and dominion of Mammon, 

All things shall come to fruition according to his will.

Behold, Mammon's wife."



Law enforcement scoured the tunnels and surrounding area for months, looking for any evidence or clues for who might have done this. But quickly, all leads ran cold. The Sheep Tunnel was permanently closed off, using rebar to gate off the entrances. Every so often people still go missing from this town; it’s always blamed on the Sheep Tunnel. 



Barry’s funeral was held at the church we attended. I sat next to my friend Sawyer. Sawyer and I had been friends for as long as I can remember, yet he struggled to find any words to console me; I didn’t blame him. I remember Father Malcolm gave some sermon about how this town is festering in a demonic presence and that we need to cleanse it. I don’t remember much from the funeral, I really only remember how uncomfortable I felt at how inappropriate it seemed to be saying that instead of giving some blessing to Barry and my family.  



About a year had passed since the funeral. Barry’s life insurance money had eventually made its way to my parents and with it we moved to a nicer part of town and into a nicer home. My parents said that they couldn’t live in that house anymore with all the memories of Barry that were in it. I didn’t realize how large of an insurance policy they had on my brother.



Sawyer and I had just graduated highschool and were figuring out what to do to celebrate our graduation. We discussed various activities for our graduation celebration sitting in the grass at a park. Somehow we found ourselves talking about paranormal hotspots.



“Why don’t we just go to Deadwood? It’s not that far from here and I’ve heard it’s got tons of haunted places,” I said.



Sawyer was less enthused “Okay yeah, but it’s a major tourist spot. If we go somewhere haunted I don’t wanna be dragged around by some tour guide. I’d hate that”



I nodded in agreement. I also had the same reservations of going to a major tourist destination. I also hated tour guides; I’d much rather just explore an area for myself. I thought for a second, still wanting to do something with the paranormal. (Looking back on this conversation, I wish I had never come up with this idea. What kind of brother and son would ever suggest something like this? I hate myself for ever having the idea.) “Well, there’s that new psychic that I’ve heard about who just opened up their business. Why don’t we go there?”



“That could be cool,” Sawyer said. “But that’s not that big of a celebration. I wanna do something more memorable,” his head resting on his hands.



“Fair. But what if we asked the psychic for information about the tunnels? There’s gotta be something paranormal in there.”



Sawyer froze, understanding what I was suggesting “You want us to ask the psychic about Barry? Your brother was sacrificed to the devil, Grayson. Why would you even bring that up? What is wrong with you?” he started to get up from the grass.



My stomach twisted, and my face became flush. I understood why Sawyer reacted that way, what happened left us all scarred. “Nothing’s wrong with me. He wasn’t sacrificed to the devil. That’s just a rumor,” my pride made me defensive. I paused and then continued, “I want to find out what happened to my brother. Wouldn’t you want the same? There’s gotta be someone who knows. And if the police were useless in figuring it out, maybe a psychic could help. Ever since the police told my family that the case ran cold I haven’t been able to sleep, Sawyer”. Deep down I knew that we both wanted to find justice for Barry, and I needed his help. Sawyer stared at me, uncertainty on his face.



“I- I don’t know. Just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach,” Sawyer said. “Barry was like a brother to me, I know he was actually your brother. But I just don’t think I can mentally do that.” Sawyer started walking away. I felt let down, but I understood where he was coming from. I didn’t say anything as he walked away.

  


About a week had passed without any contact from Sawyer. I wanted his help, but I didn’t want to force him to do something that he wasn’t comfortable with. I laid in my bed, lost in thought, when my phone rang. It was Sawyer.



“I want to find out what happened to Barry before he died. I know your family has been falling apart since his death and I want to find justice for him. I owe it to both him and you”



I didn’t know how to respond. I was relieved he would follow me down this tunnel, “Thank you, Sawyer. I do too”



“Tomorrow,” Sawyer said, “Let’s see the psychic tomorrow.”



Sleep didn’t come easily to me that night. My mind was running rampant with ideas and possibilities of what could come. My thoughts were split up into three parts. One: I am very skeptical of psychics. I think a lot of them are con artists who take advantage of people who do believe in the supernatural and want some sort of contact with the great beyond. Two: There’s a possibility that some psychics are real and actually have some sort of connection to the supernatural or are just more intune with their spiritual side than other people, and I’m desperate for answers. Three: My own personal belief of ghosts or hauntings is that typically they don’t happen. On occasions, I believe that certain places can hold dark spirits or evil feelings. But one thing I believe wholeheartedly is that when you speak of the devil, he will come.

  


The next day I pulled up to Sawyer's house at the time that we had discussed. He came out to my car when he saw me pull up. “You sure you still wanna do this?” I asked.



Sawyer took a breath “Yeah, I’m sure. I owe your family this much.”



The psychic had opened up shop in a strip mall in Rapid City, which was only about a 30 minute drive from where we lived. On our way there we listened to music, mostly the band Gorillaz. Luckily, the music helped break the tension between us and we were able to joke and talk how we normally do.



The time passed by quickly and in no time we pulled up to the street the psychics shop was on. When we pulled into the parking lot of the plaza, there weren’t any parking spots close to the psychic, but as we drove past it we saw the name “Ms. Scylla’s Dark Arts Emporium”



“Weird,” I mumbled under my breath. We had to park on the other side of the parking lot in order to find a spot. Sawyer and I got out of my car and began walking. We passed by a deli shop as a sheriff and deputy walked out. “Sheriff Nelson?” I said. Sawyer looked over in surprise. 



“You’re that Miller boy! Grayson, was it?” Sheriff Nelson responded.



“Yeah! How have you been doing?”



“I’ve been good. Just taking my lunch break,” the Sheriff laughed. He was a larger man, but was kind. The Sheriff and I had some small talk, and we were soon on our way.



“How do you know him?” Sawyer asked.



“He was one of the officers who worked on Barry's case. He helped a lot and led almost every single search effort into the tunnels. He’s a good man; my family grew close to him.”



We reached the emporium, there was a sign in the window that read: “*Palm readings, tarot cards, and scrying*” We walked in and a little bell chimed. Somewhere in the back an older woman called, “I’ll be there in just a minute”. The first thing I noticed about this place was the smell. It had an old musty scent, almost like a library, but with the faint smell of rot mixed in. The second thing I noticed was a large painting in the back of the room. It was a fiery landscape. On the left in the painting was a mound of gold; a throne sat in the middle. There was a demon sitting on the throne. Gold encrusted horns were protruding from its head and it wore a headdress that was decorated in jewels. There was nothing particularly scary about the painting, but I shuddered from it. We looked around the store for a brief moment. It was filled with chintzy trinkets. There were animal bones, “spell books”, dark fantasy paintings, role playing dice, and various other seemingly useless items. I was not impressed. We heard footsteps coming from behind a curtain that was behind the checkout counter. The curtain parted and out walked an old lady. Her hair was gray and long with a dreaded lock in the front that had a feather and what looked to be small bones woven into it, about the size you’d see from a cat. Her face was wrinkled, and she had deep brown eyes. Her outfit, though, looked like she had found a "psychic" costume at Spirit Halloween.



“Well hello,” the old woman cooed, “What can I help you with?” 



A little put off by her appearance, expecting something more authentic, I forgot to speak. Luckily Sawyer shot up.



“We’re here for some advice or guidance with some questions we have about the supernatural. There was an incident that we wanted your help with.”



The woman smiled warmly at us. “Follow me back here.” We walked with her back behind the curtain, passed a few stacks of dusty boxes, and into a room that was also blocked by curtains. As the woman parted them we went inside and sat down at a small round table that had a black cloth with a dark red trim that draped over the table. Atop the table was a crystal ball that had a golden, demonic looking hand as the base. Sawyer shot me a look that said “*We’re gonna waste our money on this old goat?”* I shrugged and cocked my head to the side saying “*We’ll see what happens, I’ll pay.”* 



The old woman looked at us both slowly, “So what do you want to know?”



Sawyer spoke first. He started out slow, “About a year ago my friend's brother went missing,” he nodded towards me. “Everyone in our town searched everywhere. Two months later we found out that his brother was murdered. Not only was he murdered, his entire body was dismembered and positioned into some-” His voice cut out. “Like some sort of statue,” he said softly. I quietly relived the moment the police told my parents what happened to Barry, I shuddered.



“Not only that,” I whispered, “There was an almost a scripture-like passage on the wall. It talked about Mammon. I know in the Bible it talks about mammon, but as wealth. This mammon had the ‘m’ capitalized; like it was a name. Do you know what that is?”



A silent grin crept across the woman's face. “*Mammon.”* She said it in a whisper but with more force behind it then I thought possible. When she said it, darkness settled in the room. A weight fell on everyone around the table, almost as if a weighted blanket were draped over me.

“Mammon is one of the 7 demon lords. The lord of greed and wealth. He wants all, and he will take all.”



“What did he want with my brother?” I leaned forward as I spoke. Waiting for the answer like a patient waiting for their diagnosis.



“One can’t say for certain, but I could guess that it wasn’t Mammon himself who wanted your brother, but someone who was trying to gain something *from* Mammon.”



Sawyer and I both froze; lead building in our stomachs. Tears began to form in my eyes and my voice wavered, “What could they gain from mutilating my brother?”



The old woman's eyes flickered, “Do you want to find out?” Her grin becoming more prominent.



Sawyer and I glanced at each other. So many emotions flashed through me; sorrow, curiosity, but mostly fear. Looking at the psychic I whispered, “I want to know.”



The old woman put her hands on the crystal ball and let out a breath that sounded like a death rattle. Her body trembled slightly; her eyes fixed on the ball as she muttered some words I couldn’t understand. I felt a presence entering the room. It literally felt as if someone else had walked into the room and was standing behind us. I shot a look behind me, and saw nothing. The room was even darker now. I looked over at Sawyer, his eyes were glued to the woman and the ball; tears running down his face. A gurgle escaped the woman's mouth and she began breathing heavily. Fear had masked her face. She started looking around the room as if she was trying to see something. Then she spoke.



“Who’s there?” Her voice was no longer an old woman's voice and it sounded familiar. “Martin? Grayson? Is that you? If that’s you this isn’t funny. Get out of there.” 



I began actively crying, soft moans escaped from my mouth as tears poured down my face. “B-Barry!” I screamed.



The old woman didn’t acknowledge me. She suddenly screamed in that same young boy’s voice, Barry’s voice, “Who are you?! Grayson! Grayson, help me!” The woman began moving around in her chair as if she were running; her hands still connected to the crystal ball. Her body jolted and she groaned. She began inching like a worm, still seated in her chair; leaning over the table, and she craned her head to look behind herself, “Pleeease! Please stop! Don’t kill me! Please don’t kill me!” Then the psychic's head violently shot to the side and she began gurgling and shaking. Without warning, she smashed her head into the table and lay motionless.



I was now sobbing uncontrollably. Struggling to get up from my chair, my limbs were too weak and shaken to get me up. Sawyer saw me struggling, wiping the tears from his eyes, he quickly reached me, helping me to my feet. As my friend lifted me up, the old woman sat up in her chair and shot over the table, knocking it over; landing on top of me.



“MAMMON! MAMMON! MAMMON!” She screeched in my face over and over. I fought to get her off of me. Sawyer and I were both screaming as we tried to get her off. She pulled a small bone out of her hair and stabbed me in the side with it. As soon as she did, she stopped screaming, got off of me, and ran deeper into her store. I felt blood pooling down my side, but we didn’t hesitate for a single moment. We sprinted out of the store, accidentally knocking over a vase of fake eyeballs on the way out. 



Sawyer drove us 10 miles out of the city and pulled over on the side of the road. I was an emotional wreck and Sawyer wasn’t much better off. My side was now soaked in blood; I began feeling woozy. That feeling of darkness still hadn’t left me. Whatever was in that shop was evil. I had never felt something like that in my entire life up to this point. Nonetheless, I knew the wound in my side was the first problem that needed to be addressed. 



“Sawyer, can you drive me to the hospital?” I said, holding my side.



Sawyer looked over at me and saw the blood on my hand. He quickly wiped the tears from his face and locked in, “Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I can drive.” 



We drove to the instant care. Even though I was actively bleeding, we sat in the waiting room for almost 15 minutes before a nurse called us back. I was treated with antibiotics and easily sewn up. Sawyer took me home as we sat in silence in the car. How do you even talk about what happened? As the young men that we were, we struggled talking about how we felt for small and simple things, let alone something as traumatic as what we had experienced. We pulled up to my house as the sun was setting and Sawyer dropped me and my car off, he walked home; his house was only a block away. 



I walked into my house, carefully avoiding my parents; I didn’t want to have to explain the blood and my mental state, and walked into my room. Carefully laying myself down on my bed, avoiding my hurt side, I soon fell asleep; overcome by exhaustion.



As quickly as I had fallen asleep, I began to dream. I was in an aspen grove on a dirt trail. The trail itself was littered with leaves. I looked up; it was dusk. As I walked down the trail, there was no sound in the trees. No birds chirping, no crickets singing; nothing. I remembered when I was younger and in a scout group, our leader taught us that when the forest goes silent, danger is near. Remembering this, my senses heightened, and fear began to overwhelm me. I quickened my pace down the trail. Suddenly the forest around me darkened. I looked up, surprised that nightfall came so soon, but it hadn’t. It was still dusk. A sickening dread fell over me and I struggled to breath. I fell on my knees and put my face in my hands, trying to calm myself and saying a silent prayer. Out of fear I forced myself awake from my dream. My eyes shot open, struggling to adjust to the darkness. My ears focused first; crickets chirping and water trickling. As my eyes finally adjusted I realized I was still outside. I was kneeling in a small stream; my pants were soaked and my hands lay in my lap. I was cold and it was dark. At first I thought I was still dreaming, but I had a sense of awareness that I knew meant I wasn’t dreaming. I looked up into the sky and saw stars; it was nighttime, only moonlight showed me my surroundings. I looked forward, panic forming behind each breath I took. I knew I had gone to sleep in my bed. I knew that. But now, I’m kneeling in a stream, in the middle of the night, and in front of me stands a fence of rebar. Dread and fear built up in my chest as I realized where I was. About 20 yards in front of me was where they found Barry’s body. The scriptural passage that was found on the walls here a year ago echoed through my mind, "Verily, I say unto thee, appeasel of our God in this mortal realm is nigh unto impossible to attain. Yet, through the might and dominion of Mammon, All things shall come to fruition according to his will. Behold, Mammon's wife." As those words echoed through me, fear took over my body as I began to tremble. 



I scrambled to my feet, I realized I wasn’t wearing any shoes, but I didn’t care as I ran up the side of the embankment that formed the stream that led into the tunnel. As I got to the top I looked at my surroundings lit by the moon. Trees and bushes blocked my view. If I was in a calmer state of mind I could have easily found my way to the road that was only a couple hundred yards away, a road I had driven many times. But in my panic, I bolted in a random direction; trying to free myself from the fear that nipped at my every step. A few minutes of running had passed and eventually the foliage opened up into a clearing of downed trees. Beyond the clearing I could see light coming from a cul de sac up ahead. I passed by the houses, still not entirely sure where I was, but I knew if I kept walking down this road it’d eventually lead back into town. My feet were bloody and covered in thorns and needles, but I didn't dare stop until I made it back home. After about 30 grueling minutes of walking I finally made it back to my neighborhood. I stumbled into my house, grabbed some tweezers from my bathroom, filled a large pot with warm water, and sat down putting my feet in the pot so I could get them cleaned. I glanced over at the clock on the stove, it read: 2:56am. I spent the next 20 or so minutes picking thorns out of my feet, then I shuffled back to bed and went to sleep; I was exhausted.



In the morning I was awoken by my dad coming into my room, “Grayson?” 



I stirred awake and looked over at him, “What’s up?” I said groggily. I was still wrapped in the soft tendrils of sleep from yesterday's exhausting day and night. 



“Are you alright? There’s a bloody pot in the kitchen and some blood leading to your room.”



I sat up and winced, my side was still in a lot of pain. “Yeah, sorry about that. I had a late night with Sawyer and cut my foot open.” Before my dad could question me further on it, I cut him off, “It’s not a big deal. I already took care of it. I just had a long night and didn’t give much attention to cleaning up.” 



My dad gave me a look that only parents can give that simply said “You’re not telling me everything.”



I waved him off, my pain and tiredness urging me to lay back down. “It’s fine dad, I’ll take care of it later,” I laid back down and a few seconds later my dad walked out of my room, closing my door behind him. I could hear him talking to my mom down the hallway.



“Well is he alright?” my mom asked worriedly.



“I guess he’s fine enough. He said that he hurt his foot while he was out with Sawyer last night. He’s tired and doesn't want to talk.” I could hear a pair of footsteps coming down the hallway toward my room. “Leave him alone honey, let him sleep. You can ask him more questions when he wakes up.” There was a pause, then the footsteps retreated away from my door.



The rest of what my parents said became muted as I quickly drifted back to sleep. The next time I was woken up was by my phone buzzing on my nightstand. I groggily grabbed my phone, rubbing my eyes as I did. Sawyer was calling. “Hey what's up, man.” 



“Why haven’t you been answering your phone? I called you like 6 times.”



I pulled my phone away from my face to check my notifications. Sure enough, 6 missed calls from Sawyer. “Sorry man, I didn’t sleep well last night.” That’s when I was reminded of what happened last night and all the terror and dread flooded back into me.



“That sucks man. I didn’t sleep too well either,” Sawyer said. He sounded like he was about to say something else but I cut him off.



“Sawyer, did you…” I couldn’t exactly think of how to phrase this without sounding weird. “Did you go anywhere last night?”



“What? Why would I? After what happened with that old hag I didn’t even leave my room,” Sawyer sounded almost mournful by the way that he said that. I could tell that what happened reopened old wounds for both of us. “Did you go somewhere after I dropped you off?”



I paused. “Yeah. I did. But by accident, if you can call it that.”



“What the heck do you mean ‘by accident’? How do you go somewhere by accident?” A hint of irritation was in his voice.



“I mean I think I sleepwalked last night, Sawyer. I left my house without even knowing in the middle of the night.” The fear that came with recounting the helplessness I found myself in last night was making me agitated. “I dreamed I was walking in an aspen forest and when I woke up from my dream I was sitting in front of the Sheep Tunnels.”



“What?” Sawyer choked out, “You’re lying.”



“I’m not!” I shouted, “Listen! I woke up kneeling in a stream that was trickling out of the tunnel.” I began to recount what happened to me last night to Sawyer. “I don’t know what’s happening.”



When Sawyer heard the fear and panic in my voice, his skepticism thawed. “Are you ok?”



“I don’t know. I think I’ll be ok” I lied. I don’t know if it was more for Sawyer or myself.



Sawyer stammered, “Do you think this all has to do with when you were stabbed?”



I froze and began slowly lifting my shirt, trying not to agitate it more. The bandages were discolored around the wound. “I don’t know. Gimme a second.” Something didn’t look right with the bandages. I put the phone down and walked into my bathroom. I turned towards the mirror and lifted up my shirt again to get a good look at my injury. My bandage was still on, but a grayish orange liquid was leaking through the gauze. I slowly peeled off the wrap to get a better look; I was frozen with fear and disgust. The area where I was stabbed was no longer sewn closed. The wound was open larger and deeper than it initially had been. Around the stab wound hole itself the skin was a puss filled pit. The skin around the hole was gray and blackening; the same way that a bad brown recluse bite might look. My pulse quickened and my breath was coming in quick shallow bursts. I screamed.



My dad drove me to the same instant care that Sawyer and I had been to the day before. He was furious with the staff there. Yelling profanities, blaming them for not properly treating my wound, and threatening to sue for malpractice. To be honest, I was a little embarrassed about the outburst, but was grateful that my dads intensity was at least forcing the doctors to do more. 



When the professionals who are supposed to be helping you look at you with confusion and disgust it’s not a very good moral boost. The doctor said that he had never seen a stab wound turn for the worse like it had. He didn’t, or more accurately couldn’t, give a reason for what happened. But he did prescribe some antibiotics and scheduled a surgery to remove the dead and dying tissue. 



My dad and I drove back home mostly in silence, except for the few times my dad grumbled out complaints and swears about how useless today's physicians are. When we got back home I didn’t feel like doing much. I texted Sawyer an update about the doctors, tossed my phone aside, and sat on my couch. I was so tired from all the stress, but the last thing I wanted to do was go to sleep again; I decided I’d distract myself by playing some video games instead.



A few hours came and went and darkness began to fill the sky. I had already downed a couple of energy drinks, yet my eyes were still getting heavy. I didn’t want to sleep. I was afraid that I would wake up somewhere I shouldn’t be. I didn’t want to feel that sort of fear again. My mind began drifting through the events of yesterday. The psychic, the hospital, and waking up in front of the Sheep Tunnels. I must have been lost in thought for a few minutes when I realized I was drifting away to sleep. I quickly fought the grogginess away and got up from my couch to get another energy drink. I walked into my kitchen, opened my fridge, bent over to reach in, and grabbed a drink. As I began to close my fridge door I heard a gasp behind me. Adrenaline shot through my body as I spun around. I saw my mom standing in front of me, barefoot and her feet were red. Before I could understand why, she began crying.



“Mom? Are you ok?” I began walking towards her to comfort her. I grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her in for a hug; she continued crying and didn’t say a word. “What’s wrong Mom? Talk to me!” I pulled her in tighter and closed my eyes as I did. Suddenly, without warning, I was thrown backwards onto the ground, hitting my head on the way down. My eyes sprung open in shock and pain. My mom was pinning my arms above my head with strength I had never known her to have. We were no longer in my kitchen. I was laying in a dirt path covered in leaves, and we were surrounded by aspen trees.



“Mom! Get off of me! You’re hurting me!” I screamed as I struggled to get out from underneath her. 



She kept crying as she reached down into the dirt and grabbed a kitchen knife off the ground. She began slowly cutting her arm that was holding my hands down. Her blood dripped down her arm, some of it falling onto my face, but the majority of it pooling onto my hands and the ground. With each cut she let out a soft groan of pain. She then looked me in the eyes; speaking for the first time.



“You fell asleep. You shouldn’t have done that.” She then held the knife out, pointed it towards her, and swiftly drove the knife into her throat. Blood began spurting out from her neck, rushing down her chest, and staining her clothes red. Panic rushed through her eyes as she struggled to breathe; gurgling out blood. I saw my mom fall over onto her side as she slowly stopped struggling. After her body was still, her gurgling slowly writhed to a stop.



I cautiously sat up, covered in her blood, and I stared at her. My moms blood pooled out from her throat, covering the ground. Her feet were also covered in blood, even though the blood hadn’t reached her feet yet. Tears were streaming down my face. I tried screaming but no sound came out of my mouth. In this moment of agony I was left without a voice. I could do nothing to mourn my mother, I just knew I had to leave. I stood up, unsteadily, and made my way down the path. My mind was foggy and I was unable to think coherently. I continued to walk down the trail until I came to a clearing with a wide creek running down the left side of it. In the middle of the clearing, near the bank of the creek, was a dear flailing on the ground. The same dark, oppressive feeling I had felt at the psychics and the sheep tunnels washed over me, causing me to freeze in my tracks. Cold air buffeted at my face as I stared at the tormented animal; the sound of its bones cracking as it thrashed on the ground. Then I woke up. 



It was dark. Too dark to see anything; my eyes were still adjusting. I could feel my knees pressed against the cold, hard ground. The ground was covered in what I felt to be pebbles and sand. I looked around me and saw a faint light coming from behind me. It took me a second to understand where I was, and when I did dread filled the depths of my soul. The cold wind coming through the tunnel buffeted my face. I knew the Sheep Tunnels entrance was barred off, making it impossible for people to get inside; somehow, I was wrong. I struggled to my feet, ignoring the pain of walking barefoot on the cold, rock covered ground. I walked towards the entrance, towards where the rebar should be. From a distance, and because of my still adjusting eyes, it looked like the rebar gate was still fully intact. As I got closer, however; I could see that two of the rebar shafts had been cut out of the gate, making a hole just wide enough for a person to fit their body through.



As I stood there, my fear-filled brain examining the gate and figuring out the best way to contort my body to get back through the hole, I heard heavy shuffling behind me. I spun around and instinctively brought my fists up to defend myself. Even though the dawn was breaking outside, the light didn’t shine in far enough for me to make out who or what was there. 



“Hello?” I called out, both hoping and not hoping to get a response. I took a step closer to where the shuffling came from, “Is anyone there?” I didn’t hear anything in response. I wasn’t sure if the noise was in my head now or not. Reluctantly, I turned around, trying to make my way through the bars so I could get out of this nightmarish place. My adrenaline suddenly spiked when I heard a handful of pebbles tossed down the tunnel towards me. I screamed out in fear and panic, violently throwing myself back around to face the threat. “WHO’S THERE!” I screamed. No response. After a few minutes of hearing nothing I figured I could be quick enough to get through the bars before whatever was there chose to come after me. I started squeezing through the bars, attempting to be as quiet as possible. My heart was pumping, and despite being cold, I was sweating. I wanted nothing more than to be out of the tunnel, and never come back. I would make certain of it. My head made it through the bars fine, but my chest was wider and I struggled to push and pull my way through. While I was trying to finesse my body through the gap, I could hear the distinct sound of bare feet slapping down against wet concrete as someone sprinted towards me. I began squirming and screaming in fear and anger. I forced the way through the bars, ignoring the pain of my ribs being squeezed. A primal fear tore through me as I felt a hand brush my feet. I ripped my pants and cut my leg, throwing the rest of my body out through the gap. Stumbling to my feet, grunting in fearful anger, I spun around to face my tormentor only to see nothing. I held my panting breath in order to hear better. Further down the tunnel I could hear a soft, ragged cackle drifting away, deeper into the tunnel.



I felt as if the whole forest was fidgeting anxiously around me. Just waiting for me to run helplessly into it so it may engulf me. The overwhelming feeling that I was being watched from all directions began drowning my body. I spun around, trying to stop every unseen glance that was being stolen of me. Paranoia was setting in and I made the split second decision to once again run headlong into the woods. This time remembering to run towards the nearest road.



As I was racing through the trees I thought I heard the pounding of footsteps behind me. I quickly pivoted to face behind me and see my pursuer. But I saw nothing. I listened and heard nothing. Fear and paranoia had bridled me, making me rash and instinctive. Turning back around towards the road, I whispered a prayer, asking God to guide me. Soon my feet met asphalt. My speed didn’t slow as I thanked God and bolted towards town. 



I was walking through a neighborhood a few blocks away from my house, fear still heightened my senses, but the adrenaline had drained from my body leaving me tired and exhausted. A car pulled up next to me and rolled down the window. “Grayson? Grayson, get over here!” I had to duck a little to see Sawyer calling me over from the driver's seat of his car.



“Sawyer? What are you doing out here?” I said in tired excitement as I opened the door to get in. I was happy to see him. Sawyer didn’t look so happy.



“I came to find you. What are you doing out here, Grayson?”



“I- I woke up out here. I was inside the Sheep Tunnel.”



Sawyer shot a look of bewilderment at me as he began driving down the road, “What do you mean ‘inside’?”



“Someone cut open the rebar blocking the entrance. I was sitting inside of the tunnel and-”



Sawyer cut me off with a shake of his head, “Grayson. Do you know what happened at your house?”



I looked at him, staring blankly. I was too tired to process anything, “What do you mean?”



Stifling back tears, Sawyer choked out, “Something happened at your house last night. Your dad can explain.”
