I don't know if I'm having some type of weird dream sequence but, everything feels way too real to be fake. 

3 days ago, I was walking home from my morning classes; everything was normal, or at least what I considered normal, and I was messaging my girlfriend about our date later that night. I was pretty preoccupied with my messages, and music, that I hadn't noticed that I didn't have the all-clear to walk across a crosswalk, and I was hit by a car. Details are pretty fuzzy around this time, but I remember the sensations that I had felt. The loud noses of someone laying on their horn, the feeling of impact, having all the air shot out of my lungs and the mass amout of pain that entered my body; before just immediate relaxation. At the time, I thought it was my brain shooting adrenaline through my body or me entering shock but now I know it wasn't that.

I believe I blacked out for a moment before waking up at a desk. Reality had sharply hit me. The sound of shitty music blasting full volume in my ears, the feeling of clothes against my skin, the bright light from the computer screen infront of me. My eyes were burning and my whole body felt 10 times sicker than I've ever felt before. I felt like there was something wrong with my body but at the same time I still felt like I was me.

I paused the video that "I" was watching and ripped off the headphones, finding the nearest bathroom by me and throwing up. After sitting on the bathroom tiles for what felt like hours, I finally got up and took in my surroundings. I was in my mother's house; though the colors of the walls were darker and in "my" room some posters were different. 

At the moment, panic was still raging in my system so I couldn't really take in all the details of "my" room but later, or now, I can see a lot of colors in the room are different and the layout has changed. 

The overall layout of my mother's house was the same as, I guess, my universe. Some of the major physical changes to me was the fact that I now had glasses and I was much younger. In my universe, I was 23, making my way through college; now in this body, I'm 18, about to end high school. I found "my" driver's license, kind of a shock because I don't know how to drive, but my first name is different. (Now I know it's because this me hasn't changed their name yet.)

I also found "my" phone and tried opening it with my passcode (my girlfriend's birthday), and it didn't work. Luckily "I" had put a fingerprint as one of the unlocking codes so after some trying I got it to unlock. I looked through the phone's contacts and found my girlfriend's phone number, only the contact name was different. Instead of having her as "My Wife," like I have for the past 5 years, it was just her name with a ":)" next to it. I read through some of our past messages and found out that here she is dating some random guy that I've never heard of. 

One good thing that came out of this whole situation is that my mother is still alive here. In my universe, she died in a car crash 3 years ago. It was very startling seeing her again but she's older here. I'm happy she didn't question why I broke down crying when I saw her. It was nice getting to hug her again.

I was able to get out of going to "my" high school for the rest of the week and now I'm just reeling. Everything is oddly calm and familiar but i know this isn't my universe. I've been going through a lot of emotions but something just keeps telling me that this is like a second chance. I'm worried about what happened to the me that previously lived this life; and for my girlfriend in my universe. There's quite a lot of adjusting that I've been starting to go through, like how I got a call from my "girlfriend" a couple hours ago and tried my hardest not to call her by all the nicknames we had cresting together. And it hurt hearing her talking about her boyfriend. A couple other things are how I'm working at a place that I've never worked at before so I don't know how to do anything; I'll also have to relearn how to drive.

There's a lot of different things about this universe aswell, like who the president is, what national monuments are still standing. Apparently the year is 2023, which means even if the "Fall of Liberty" happens here, it hasn't happened yet. The years are a bit different aswell, along with some spellings of different months.

It's going to take a lot of adjusting but I think I'm going to take this as a second chance while I still have it. I'm going to try to conform to what other me's life is like and enjoy my time in this universe.
