TW: >!Suicide, Cancer!<


All people, when they come to die, have some experience with the sensation. The familiarity is almost soothing. We are nursed by dreams, a trial-run really, that ensures when our time comes, we are ready. Of course, it’s not always easy, and the exact nature of our death can often come as quite a surprise. Jenene, hurtling over the barrier at 90mph, is not thinking *gosh how lovely and quaint,* but she is undoubtedly acquainted with the queer sensation of inevitability. Of course, this is how I go, is an oft reported thought per those of us lucky enough to have a near death experience – a feeling that part of us knows we have always been building to this end.
 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I’m not here to talk to you about conjecture. I’m not here to talk to you about near-death experience. I’m here to talk to you about the facts. Hopefully you will, as I did, find them intriguing and, perhaps, a little disturbing.

This research began 65 years ago, under the direction of my father, Dr Robert Armitage (some of you, I have been assured, will be familiar with his work). It was sparked, unfortunately, by a great tragedy. My mother, always a melancholy woman, committed suicide just weeks after my birth. Today, we would refer to her despondency as post-partum depression, but I have been reliably informed she was always a dejected soul. Only God knows what drew my relentlessly, annoyingly optimistic father towards such a character, though I do know they shared some happy years prior to her untimely departure.
 
My father was away at a conference when he received the rather startling news that his newborn had been discovered on the steps of the local police station. As is normal for a small town, he knew the local constabulary rather well. The officers had quickly identified me and turned their attention to my mother, for whom a sudden disappearance was obviously unusual but not entirely unexpected. It took them eight hours to locate her due to the tide. Forgive me for the details – they are relevant: she had been found dashed on rocks of the little cove near our home, her head split open and slick with gangrenous ocean detritus (this I obtained from the police report). While horrified, my father was not shocked by this news. Until his own death, he cursed himself for leaving her alone with me.

This is where it all gets quite odd and is what led my father to recklessly pursue a line of research he knew would never be complete in his lifetime. For my mother, he claimed, had always felt she would die in this manner. In fact, he believed that this was the source of her melancholia. Yes! Her suicide was not the result of an extensive depression, but the source of it! 
I know what you are thinking: this is the thought-process of a grief-stricken man, unable to come to terms with his wife’s misery, and perhaps his role in enabling it. But as he was a model father, I have every reason to believe he was an excellent husband, others have said as much, and he was away for two nights only – not entirely unreasonable, even with a newborn. His work suffered for his family, not the inverse.
 
My mother, he claimed, had complained throughout their marriage of unrelentingly foreboding dreams. All featured her upcoming death. This terrified her. As someone with an idyllic life: a wonderful husband, a beautiful house in a charming seaside town, eventually a baby, she was mortified at the thought of losing it all. Her mortality became an obsession and led her into morose thinking. I believe all of us can relate to this to some degree. Due to these circumstances, I became aware of my own fragility at an unusually young age, but over the course of my research I’ve discovered that the existential dread sets in for most around the age of seven or eight. At this age my daughter’s fear of death was sparked by the departure of the family dog. She once cried out she was shot and dying – our neighbour’s car had backfired! My mother, from this age, experienced incessant dreams depicting her own demise. Some detailed, others faintly indicative, they often featured a common theme – a slip, a fall on the rocks, her body bathed in seaweed and salted foam. Upon meeting my regimented father, she began keeping a dream journal, his attempt at making her see the unreality of her situation, whilst satisfying his own selfish, scientific desire for categorisation. The dreams would come weekly, daily in bad periods, and most shared this common thread. Though not to her, my father had privately dismissed them as symptoms of an anxious mind. Upon their terrible realisation, however, they took on a new character.

Here I must ask you, how familiar are you with the concept of premonitions? Yes, I know, I know - this all sounds faintly ridiculous. My mother committed suicide; she had agency over her death. Perhaps she thought it darkly ironic to die in this way – given her expressed fears. Perhaps, paradoxically, her fears drove her to do it. These were all questions my father, and I, wrestled with. These were the questions that drove him, and I, to pursue this line of research.
 
It began as an aside. A wholly unscientific pet project. His way of controlling the situation thrust upon him. He visited the local nursing homes and questioned the more forthcoming residents on their dreams of death. As is quite normal with the elderly they were admirably blasé about their imminent expiry. Of those who did report these dreams, some reported gloriously violent ends – impossible falls from planes or grand, gladiatorial battles with vicious enemies (more common amongst the ex-servicemen). Interestingly, however, the most prevailing theme was that of illness. One gentleman, decrepit at over ninety years old, reported his terror at a repeated tuberculosis dream – a disease that had claimed both his parents. He died six months later, having been diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer. This, along with several similar synchronicities, drove my father into a potentially pseudo-intellectual frenzy. Had I been an adult at the time I would have dismissed him as over-emotional and delusional. I’m glad I couldn’t.

With arduously acquired funding, he gathered a group of 100 under-30s. A small sample, I know, but all that was available. Each year they were to submit a dream journal, but only featuring the dreams in which they died. He sometimes received ridiculous entries, as is the nature of dreams. Participant 43 once described being beaten to death when they found themselves walking naked down the Highstreet. Participant 92 was eaten alive by saurian chickens! The rambunctious entries were just highlights amongst the mundane: car crashes, cancer, illogical falls. These realistic depictions of death were obviously of more interest to him.

It took fifteen years for something even hinting at corroboration to emerge. Five of his original participants had died, two in car accidents, one hit by a speeding vehicle as a pedestrian, one suicide and one of breast cancer. He poured over the details of their journals, hoping for a gestating pattern. In many ways he found it. Only one had reported a dream describing the exact circumstances of his death – participant 33 listed a car accident several times over the years. The others, however, reported dreams that could only be described as indicative. Participant 17 described, on over twenty occasions, a dream in which they had gaping holes of flesh bored out them with a blunt knife. This was the woman who unfortunately died of cancer after several futile attempts to exorcise her tumours. Participant 59 described a repeating dream in which they were crushed by a huge, maniacal robot. They died of severe head trauma having been essentially flattened by a boy-racer. Participant 26 reported, eight times, a dream in which they were a Japanese kamikaze pilot, rather bizarre for a someone from a sleepy English village; they killed themselves by driving their Morris Minor into the river, taking with them their notoriously abusive (as per my father’s claims) husband.
 
This was obviously not evidence, yet, and aware of his own mortality my father enthusiastically exposed me to his research at a young age. I grew reading tales of participant 67’s falls from the Eiffel Tower, 14’s shotgun wounds, 81’s sluicing blood from a raggedly slit throat – I had no need for fairytales or horror stories as a child, I had something better, more tangible. Over time a genuine pattern emerged. I was away at university when I learnt of participant 43’s death. My father was tactlessly exited that they’d been stabbed for groping the wrong man’s wife. Even my somewhat sceptical self could see the parallels with their dream of naked assault.
 
My father developed a rather perverse relationship with the death of his subjects. He would grow relentlessly exited at the news of another death, rifle through reams of paper and spend days searching for parrels between the imagined deaths and reality. He was not an unemotional man but did possess an ability to separate himself from his subjects. Some were local characters – he always ensured his relationship with them remained scientific and detached. He kept his research quiet. News travelled, of course, but he shut down dinner party enquiries with nonchalance. I became his sole confidant. Research assistants came and went, I was permanent, and, once I’d aged out of teenage rebellion, I treated his work with respect he rarely encountered. Accusations of ‘new age hocus pocus’ were common, and not entirely unfounded.

What of his dreams? He passed twenty years ago – a stroke. Unfortunately, for someone so immersed in death he rarely dreamt of it. For most of the sixties and seventies, he was a habitual hashish user, which, of course, we now know disrupts the REM sleep necessary for dreaming. When he did dream, they were often abstract and, unfortunately for me, sexual (reading his journal rather disrupted my mourning process!) He would have sorted his own experience into the counterpoint file, a foil for his own thesis.

As the frequency of subject death began increasing, a pattern emerged. Two years ago, the milestone of 90% subject death was reached. Of that 90%, 32% had reported dreams detailing the exact circumstances of their death. A further 59% had at least five dreams that could be regarded indicative. The exact details were wrong, but the emotion – the prevailing mood, matched. An example: one participant, 40 years before passing, dreamt themselves choking to death, wheezing and spluttering. In their journal they said they felt their lungs ‘slick with an oily mush’. They died, intubated, of Covid-19 induced respiratory failure. Drowning dreams were also common amongst by those that would later die from Covid-19.
 
Here we must address my own contribution. I strongly believe that we, as a human culture, fundamentally misunderstand something about death. It stalks us throughout of lives, leaving little premonitions and synchronicities. A kind of narrative foreshadowing. Perhaps our understanding of time is incorrect. I am quietly partial to Nietzsche's doctrine of eternal recurrence. If our lives are constant and repeating (the best way to visualise it), it may explain why our death leaches backwards into life through a lucid déjà rêvé. This really is conjecture, best left to physicists and philosophers (of which I am neither), but I find it comfortable in the face of such unrelenting strangeness. I cannot help but try to rationalise the phenomena.
For whatever reason there is a small subset not susceptible (around 9%). Like my father, they either reported few dreams or those so abstract that interpretation would be undoubtedly futile. I strongly believe susceptibility to, and the strength of, this phenomenon may be genetic. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective) I have inherited my mother’s curse. I know I am amongst the 32%. I truly believe I have always known, and will always know, how I die.

My time is near. In these dreams I have always been aged, as I am now. Long before my bones grew weary and my heart fat, I was aware of the sensation. A kind of closing, a decaying. I am 65. Not ancient, nor even elderly by today’s standards. Still, the rot has set in. I find myself wheezing at the top of stairs. My vision darkens nauseously when I stand up quickly. 50 years of smoking have caked my lungs in a viscous tar, and I cough violently when I wake. I have felt snatches of this throughout my life, brief glimpses of my terminal decline. Why, you might ask, did I pursue this path if I knew the outcome? Why not cease smoking, exercise more, beautify my body? The obvious answer is the invulnerability of youth - the inability to fully appreciate exterior perspectives, even if you dream them in stark detail. The real answer, and one I only came to appreciate in middle-age, was a respect for the inevitability of events. Only recently have I come to understand my mother’s respect for time, and its proper course. To try and alter things would be immature and illogical.

Within these glimpses of my departure, I have felt my triumph at fulfilling my father’s work. I have seen myself submitting the final paper for review. I even saw myself writing this little piece to draw greater attention to our work. Parcels of text (I won’t tell you which) came to me years prior, and I’ve enthusiastically employed them here. Dmitri Mendeleev claimed the periodic table came to him in a dream. I have experienced much the same phenomenon. I was scared, terrified really, that altering anything I had seen: my smoking, my wasted body, my strenuous divorce, would alter the trajectory of our work and gamble the victory in its completion. It would risk the relationship I have with my daughter, and the two grandchildren I’d eyed before my daughter herself was born. My father’s greatest mistake was not recording all dreams of his participants, not reading the cacophony of the dream state in its bright entirety. My daughter, and her children after, will correct this. 
Tonight, or tomorrow (it has never been clear if it is day or night) I will follow my mother into the cove. I know how she must have felt now. I am not anxious. I have fallen many times before. I hope I will wake in 1959 and see her face once more.

I ask of *you*, reading this now. Do not discount your dreams. Think hard (I know they fade). Record them, visualise them, feel them. They probably hold the key to your ending. If (when) you uncover this, I hope you will show strength. Do not shirk from the oblivion but do not embrace it either. Do not let it rule you. Do not try to rule it. Here, we toy with fate.
