*Part of the series:* [The Concrete Below the River](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/870ysy/the_concrete_below_the_river/)

I’m telling you, and everyone else I know, to just stay away from those God damned concrete piers. There is no reason at all to put your life in jeopardy to photograph yourself next to them. There’s no reason to go up to them to see what they look like. There’s no need to touch them, post them on Instagram, or imitate one for Halloween. I’m glad that radio DJ Lauren Hunter hasn’t received any ill effects, but it’s more unusual to come out unscathed than it is to have this *thing* follow you around for the rest of your days.

Of course, maybe she is having problems. Who would she tell? Her listening audience? I told some people once, and where did that get me? 

It had been five years since we had discovered the concrete cube buried underneath the riverbed. At the time, I had been concerned that the low hum it emitted, that seemingly only a few of us could hear, would be a harbinger of death and destruction. Especially after many of my staff experienced effects ranging from headaches to being driven to exceptional self-harm and suicide. I lamented when they incorporated it into the Tawatina bridge structure, a bridge that is now an integral part of the infrastructure for the Edmonton Valley Line LRT system. That means more concrete than ever was now attached to it. I was hoping that would perhaps silence it. But then the cracks started showing up in multiple places further down in the line piers. That’s when I started hearing the cube again. 

“Where did you go just now?” Vanessa inquired.

“I wasn’t hearing it. If that’s what you’re asking.” I adjusted myself in my seat. “I was actually thinking, you know, so many people’s first instinct in films or books about demonic possession is to move away. If a demon moved into my home, I’d fuck him up. I wouldn’t move. You’re in my house now. You play by my rules.”

“I’ll be honest with you, Pete.” Vanessa sighed. “The theme about this being a possession is something we’ve touched on before. We’re not meeting next week because of your trip, and I was hoping we’d make a little more progress this time since you won’t be returning for a while. We’ve already hashed this out.”

I nodded, shrugged, and waived her off. “Oh, I know, I know. I know this isn’t demonic or whatever. I never really thought it was. It’s far from that. It’s something else. It is what it is?” I made kind of a duck face, not really sure how to continue. I looked back at her with raised eyebrows, expecting her to prompt me for where to take the conversation next.

“Okay, but do you believe that, or do you just believe that’s what I want to hear from you?” She probed.

“No, I definitely don’t believe it’s demonic. Don’t worry. We’re well past that.” I reassured.

Vanessa breathed out a sigh of relief and reviewed her notes again. She twirled a pen between long, slender fingers with shimmering adorned fingernails. 

“I’m going to say something here with the risk of sounding like one of your favorite references, but I’m sure you’ll love that. I want you to do what Dr. Leo Marvin would tell Bob Wiley. I want you on this trip to take a vacation from your problems.” She smiled and leaned in. I couldn’t help but chuckle.

“I love it, but this is a work trip, I don’t think I can exactly do what you’re suggesting…” I furrowed.

“Just…think of it this way. Whatever is bothering you here isn’t going to be there. Take some time between the work to unwind and enjoy yourself. See some live music. Buy a girl a drink. Have a dance. Get drunk. Do all those things I would counsel all my other clients *not* to do.” Vanessa urged, with a grin on her face.

With that, I left the session, considering what she had mentioned. It was the last item that really had stuck out to me. In the years since I had first discovered the cube, I had shied away from more or less being human. Whereas some might have found the perceive end of the world as an excuse to drink and fuck and party, I had become so straight-and-narrow, I was essentially dormant. I had become the poster-boy for holding your breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Not to mention, mind altering substances aren’t necessarily the first thing you’d want to jump to when you’re questioning your own sanity. 

And while I wasn’t unreliable, I was unreachable. It was a matter of months before my spouse had begun complaining I wasn’t emotionally available. I had eschewed connection for escapism. I began spending a lot of time playing video games and watching tv. In the background, my kids grew older, started school, and made friends. I watched my family enjoy sunny days and vacations and life events. But I was not an active participant in any of these things. I had just checked out. The pain of knowing I’d probably lose them was overwhelming. Nothing makes you want to detach from everyone around you faster than thinking they might die horribly. Some might try to spend every last second with their loved ones. To me, that just made it more painful. Call me a coward. I couldn’t do it. I disconnected from them, and so, they moved on from me. I saw my kids three nights every second week. The small experiences I had with them were enough to convince me I was making the most of the time we had remaining. Vanessa recommended I had started spending more time with them. Their mom is reluctant. I want to think everything that happened was imaginary, and I can enjoy the time with them without the pain of thinking I might have to let go. But it hadn’t been easy. I couldn’t just write off my experiences as being in my head. The same experiences were happening to others, too. 

Vanessa has also recommended I get back into the workforce. The company my grandfather and father had worked so hard to build, the legacy I had spent my formative years solidifying, I had sold as a turn-key operation to other investors. During the pandemic it was easy to find other parties who were looking to strike out on their own, and I had substantial contracts and connections that made my brand difficult to overlook. The income from the sale would be enough to keep me comfortable and solvent for at least a few years. I thought about the potential legacy I may be denying my family. I had asked my five year old son at the time if he wanted to do what Daddy did and take over the family business when he got older. He said he wanted to be a professional baseball player. I hope history goes on long enough for him to realize that dream. Certainly it’s a better calling than being the project manager that discovered the thing that would destroy us all. He could have the love and devotion of fans. I’ll keep being asked every so often by internet strangers if what I found was real. You need only look up the articles.

It had been an unseasonably warm fall. The trees had only begun to turn colours, which is unusual for an Albertan autumn. Typically, that would have started in late August. I left Vanessa’s office and then stopped briefly at home to finalize my packing. I shoved the beat-up luggage into the nose of my car and set out for the Edmonton International Airport.  

I appreciated places like the airport. It was noisy, and there was always a lot going on. It was enough to block out the noise in my head and drown any intrusive thoughts. 

I somehow slept on the plane. The loud white noise from the jet engines cancelled the hum in my brain long enough for me to nod off. I don’t even sleep that well in my own bed.

The sun was already setting when we touched down in Nashville. I collected my bags, spent some time ogling a nice flying V in a case as an advertisement to the Gibson Garage, and then waited in a very long line in the parking garage to fetch my Budget rental car. I stopped at Target on the Charlotte Pike before retreating to my Air BnB on the Vanderbilt campus. I fell asleep drinking an array of American soda that we simply don’t have back home, and listening to the Drive By Truckers’ *Carl Perkins’ Cadillac.*

**Wednesday, October 12, 2022**

Cracks. In the Valley line piers. I could see them. I could see the cracks, like thick black spider legs, all the way from the road. I parked my car in the middle of the road and got out. Only, it was an old Pontiac Lemans station wagon. I remember my Dad used to have one when I was about six or seven years old. It was hot out. The sky was clear. A warm, dry wind blew the grass and weeds next to the curbs back and forth. The air smelled of dry, dirty pavement. I opened the back door of the wagon, and my kids piled out. 

“Where are we Daddy?” My daughter asked.

I didn’t answer. “Don’t forget your masks.” I chided.

We donned our gas masks and approached one of the piers. Other cars began to stop behind us and the occupants also switched off their cars and exited. They also approached the piers. Collectively we had resigned our fates. We knew we had to stop here and do what was required of us. 

I approached one of the piers holding the elevated train rails. I ran my hand over the concrete. Cold. Smooth. My hand brushed over the surface, my fingertips lightly catching one of the cracks. It began to open. I slipped my hand inside. An intense burning pain shot up my arm. My fingers had been cut off. My daughter began screaming and tried to pull her mask off as my blood and tissue sprayed out of the crack and on to her masked face. I couldn’t pull my hands out to stop her as the pier slowly chewed my hands off. I put my foot against the pier and tried to pull my hands out, but my daughter had already worked her mask off and breathed in the now somehow toxic air and was coughing uncontrollably. My son was crying so hard no sound was coming out. He was being irresistibly pulled toward a smaller crack about three feet up with his arms outstretched. He knew it would hurt, but he couldn’t stop himself. I was powerless to help them. Somehow I was suddenly released, and fell backwards. I scrambled to maintain my balance. I immediately went to wrap my arms around my kids, and to try and save them, but I had no arms. Blood poured from the stumps. I looked down, and then looked at my kids who were begging me for comfort. I shook my head, impotent to do anything in the situation and slumped to my knees. The cracks in the pier had chewed my arms off entirely. 

A droning sound, a pestilent vibrating buzz filled the air being emitted from the pier. I had no hands to cover my ears, I had no hands to cover my children’s ears as the sound drew them closer to the pier itself. The buzzing grew louder. My alarm was going off. I woke up.

I texted my ex to see how the kids were doing. They were fine. In school as usual. My son had recently had a problem with swearing in his Kindergarten class. She had reported how at thanksgiving dinner he had told his aunt that ‘mashed potatoes fucking sucked.” I felt as if she was implying I had taught him the words on his most recent visit. I was distraught by the fact I couldn’t immediately talk to them to verify their safety, but I was promised a call later in the evening.

I texted Vanessa.

*The dreams have started again. I don’t remember the last time I had one this bad. This time the kids were there.*

I showered and dressed for the ten o’clock meeting I had planned, and awaited her reply.

*It’s normal. You’re starting something new and out of your comfort zone. They’re the thing that makes you feel most vulnerable. They are OK and so are you. Like we talked about: growth can be painful! No pain no gain!*

I kind of sneered at her positivity, but then again, people who hadn’t experienced the cube’s powers would have a lack of general understanding. To those who hadn’t heard the infernal noise it put into your head, who hadn’t been overtaken by an overwhelming loss of control and immediate desire to self harm, those afraid of a concrete block likely looked simply mentally ill.

I took one last look in the mirror before exiting the small condo I had booked. I tried to button up the top button on my navy suit jacket but it clearly had become too small for me in the last few years of my sedentary, depressive state.

*Fuck it.* I left it open. 

Fall in Nashville was more like July in Edmonton. The sky was clear. I drove with my window open to take in the sounds and smells of a new city. I continued through mid-town, across an overpass, past a Beaman dealership or two, and continued down Broadway. I switched on the radio to country music. Why not? *When in Rome.* I thought.

Broadway was packed with tourists, even though it was still mid-morning. Golf carts, monster trucks and tractors provided guided tours, and were interesting obstacles to avoid whilst driving. I hung a right just before a confusing public art installation, Nissan Stadium shining just out of reach.

I had a meeting with a rather large project management firm based out of Houston who were looking for a consultant. It turns out some of my expertise was in their wheelhouse. A few friends in high places had recommended me to whatever contacts they had available when I feigned the smallest of interest in getting back to work. They didn’t know about some of the things I had been experiencing. I could rest my absence on the terrible “accidents” that had befallen Bill and some of our other staff members. That would certainly be an excuse for any rational person to take some time away from work. Therefore, they were happy to put their names on the line and try to assist me in setting up some new projects. 

I walked into an extremely trendy office in a very old building. Nashville was quite a bit older than Edmonton and I had been amused by some of the pre-civil-war architecture displayed. Certainly, Edmonton had some buildings that were similarly old, but they were few and far between. We had not preserved our history as a city the way some others had done. Of course, all this beauty, all the hard work a project manager could appreciate by so many would be washed away when that *thing* had its way. The idea that all the history attached to some of these great structures would simply cease to exist made me oddly sentimental. I paused to place a hand on the brick in the stairwell of the entrance. Cold. Rough. My hand began to tingle as if the brick were vibrating. I could see my hand turning black, beginning at my fingertips and working its way up my arm as if through my veins. I quickly recoiled, and brought my hand to my chest, holding it tight with my other hand. I took a few deep breaths and closed my eyes. When I reopened them, the vision had ceased. I turned my arm over and flexed my hand. The pain oddly remained. I drew up the cuffs of my dress shirt and blazer and revealed a small tattoo. *Remain Steadfast*. I had it done after the incidents of 2018 as I felt it would help me cope. It was a line from an old Hatebreed song, *Perseverance.* The line was: *your world is coming apart, remain steadfast.* Unfortunately, in the time since, things simply continued to fall apart, and I had not remained steadfast. I was falling apart with it. But in certain times, seeing the words in print still helped me regain my bearings. I drew down my cuffs, regained my composure, and made my way up the stairs.

Dan Marino (no not *that* Dan Marino), the VP of development, jovially met me in the waiting room. He shook my hand as if he was trying to crush all the bones within and guided me into a meeting room. My hand was now throbbing instead of tingling. 

I had often wondered about if there was an afterlife. And if so, did people who tried to kill your hand by giving unusually firm handshakes have a punishment of having their hand liquified by an industrial press for eternity? 

Dan spoke with a slight southern accent and was hospitable. He offered me coffee and then cracked a few jokes before launching into the discussion.

“You came in highly recommended by Scott and Victoria in Houston. I’m so glad we have a chance to meet. We have a unique opportunity that we require a consultant of your stature on.” Dan spoke surely and confidently as he flicked on a large monitor in the meeting room and began displaying a PowerPoint of the project. I nodded along. 

“You might have seen a string of Beaman car dealerships on your way here this morning.” He suggested.

“Oh…uh…yeah, I think I did.” I shrugged. How could I have missed them, it seemed like there was one every three blocks.

“Well, you might have seen this particular one, it’s going to be replaced with six high rise towers. It has a unique problem we have to solve, however.” He flipped through slides quickly. “As you can see, the edge of the site is extremely close to the 40, there is a steep incline down to the freeway...” 

I began looking around the room and out the window. The late morning sun was gleaming off of other adjacent properties. The old building, while mostly renovated, still sported the original hardwood floor and was somewhat musty. I could hear a low hum. It was different than what I was used to though. I wrote it off as possibly being music from a nearby honky-tonk. 

“…we really don’t necessarily know what we’ll find when we begin excavating as some of the surveying records were lost to time…” He continued, not noticing that I had already stop paying attention.

I was becoming increasingly uncomfortable. The room seemed to be getting hotter. The low frequency buzzing was getting louder and louder. The musty stench became thicker to the point I felt as if I was suffocating. 

“We know that construction techniques around that time weren’t especially sophisticated, and a lot of scrap and waste exists…”

I thought I began to smell smoke. My face burned as if I had stuck it too close to an open oven door. I looked around the room completely perplexed by what was happening. Dan didn’t seem at all phased.

“…initial testing seems to suggest there’s a rather large concrete mass that we may have to incorporate into some of the structure if we can’t remove it…”

Flames suddenly devoured the partitioning wall behind him and shot across the floor. Dan looked me squarely in the face as his eyes melted into white puddles that ran down his cheeks. Smoke billowed from his nostrils as he became engulfed by flames. My feet were burning. I looked down to see fire consume my feet and my legs. The extreme sharp pain of my crackling skin now visible through my burning suit pants was such that I couldn’t scream, I could only sneeze.

“*Gol-ly!* Here have a tissue!” Dan slid a Kleenex box across the meeting room table. I glanced around. No fire. The heat on my face dissipated as cool air emanated from an air-conditioning duct above me. I wiped my nose.

“My apologies. Did you say a concrete mass?” I enquired; eyebrows raised. There was no way this was happening again.

“Yeah, strange, isn’t it? But I hear you’ve managed a project like this before, so you’d be the perfect guy to do it.” He grinned, hopefully.

I paused for a second. I thought about what possible rational response I could give him that didn’t include screaming and running, warning him that doom was immanent, slitting my wrists with a pair of scissors in a nearby pencil holder, or possibly launching myself into space. Although that would particularly be a challenge. I had done well selling my former business, but not Jeff-Bezos-rocket-to-space well. 

“I mean, most of the legwork is done by a team of excellent engineers, I merely keep tabs on all of our contractors. I don’t think you necessarily need me to…” I kind of trailed off at the end. Yes, I was perhaps blowing the chance I had worked so hard to convince myself that I needed for my mental recovery. But another cube? Already since landing in Nashville I was having dreams and visions to a degree I had not felt since I was initially close to the cube in Edmonton four years ago. I had worked my way back to some semblance of normalcy. If I was crazy, if I had been having episodes, surely working on a project such as this would likely cause a relapse of my illness. If I wasn’t, then I sure as fuck didn’t want to get anywhere near a *second* cube. 

“I’ll be frank.” Dan cut me off. His face was now stern, a bit of a surprise as he had been soft and friendly up until this point. “We haven’t had the best experience with previous project management firms we’ve hired and we paid the price for it on our last endeavor. I was disappointed in their performance. Especially for a big firm such as the one we had used. I won’t name them, but I’m sure you’re familiar with them.” He leaned back in his chair and looked out the window for a second, and then back at me. “This is a hundred million dollar project. Our earnings last year were double that, and we want double to triple *that* figure this year. With this project we should be earning that amount per quarter. I can’t afford to have anyone but the best in charge of some of the aspects of this work, and the guys back in Houston are convinced that’s you.”

I took a sip of the now lukewarm coffee in front of me. I winced at the bitter liquid, trying to find a rational excuse that would allow me to bow out gracefully. 

“I understand.” I began. “However, I should really clarify that I had an excellent team I worked with in my previous business, and I don’t have them anymore. I sold my business four years ago.” I tilted my head, waiting for his reply.

“Don’t be modest!” His voice now suddenly boomed. He semi-chuckled and then continued. “Besides, our offer will certainly include whatever you need to get a new team off the ground. Hire whomever you like. Get the ol’ band back together if need be. We’re not short on resources.” He glanced around the office nodding. I realized he thought I was objecting because he was under the impression I was there for maximum financial gain. I wasn’t afraid of him low balling me. I was afraid of going insane, breaking into a tool box on a service body truck and cutting myself one-hundred-and-forty times requiring skin graft surgery as Bill had. I continued to hesitate, not knowing how to further stall. Once again, Dan took the delay as one related to financial skepticism. “Look, I can see you’re a man that enjoys the finer things. I could tell as soon as I saw your Zegna suit and the vintage Siffert Autavia on your wrist. So do I. I won’t insult you, trust me.”

I hated hearing “trust me” as a reason to do something. I didn’t even trust my own mind, how was I to trust someone else entirely? 

Dan straightened up and clasped his hands in front of him. He looked at me very directly. “Usually we tender these types of contracts. We don’t usually sole source them. But I have ensured our board, my colleagues, and higher-ups, that this is *the best* thing we can do here. Everything you and your former company has done was done efficiently, inexpensively, and with exceptional results. That’s what we’re looking for here. I was assured that if I had you down here, we could negotiate something. I’m hoping you won’t make a fool of me.”

If there was one thing that motivated me, it was indeed disapproval by other people. If I returned to Edmonton after bailing on the potential contract, if I embarrassed Scott and Victoria, they had enough clout in the industry to ensure I’d potentially never work again. My money wasn’t going to last forever. Apparently, they had told Dan that if he just offered me a price I was looking for I’d say yes. What choice did I have?

“What is the opportunity to work remotely? I have kids back home and…well…their mom and me aren’t together anymore. So I can’t exactly move them with me…” I figured playing to his sense of humanity might work. I didn’t like using the kids as an excuse to get out of something, but my objection *was* true. Also, if I *was* going to take on this job, I definitely wasn’t going to personally watch the jobsite descend into a chaotic bloodbath in person. 

“Well, that is a concern. Typically I’d like my project managers to have their finger on the pulse…”

*Yes! An out!*

“…but we’ve made such great strides over the pandemic instituting things like Microsoft Teams that we all work semi-remotely now. I’d probably have you fly in every two weeks or so. You can build your travel expenses into your contract, and as long as you have a team here, I don’t think it’ll be an issue. I understand, family comes first!”

*Fuck!* I was out of objections. Dan was expecting some sort of response. He was looking right at me, an expectant smile on his face. I had to say something. 

“Well, uh, okay. That…sounds…good…” I started. At least they used Teams and not Zoom.

“Great! Well we’ll send you the proposal and if it looks good, you can sign it and send it back to us as soon as possible. I’m open to negotiating if need be!” Dan cut me off quickly and began wrapping things up. I was hoping between the time I softly uttered what he took as a confirmation, and whenever he sent me a contract, I could come up with maybe some other means of escaping the project with my integrity intact. “You should have the proposal in your email before you get back to your hotel!”

*Fuck!* That didn’t leave me much time. Perhaps the cube would destroy everything in the twenty-minute drive back to the hotel. Then again, there wasn’t much hope of that. In the past four years the original cube hadn’t done much. Or had it? I had been out of the game a while. I didn’t want to know what the thing was doing so I stayed away from it. Perhaps it was still claiming victims. 

“Now! You’re in Music City! I suggest you get out there and see everything it has to offer. Get yourself some hot chicken!” And with that Dan brought me back to the moment, and I was reminded of my original mission that Vanessa had left me with. I shook his hand and departed. 

It was noon when I hit Broadway, and the high sun made wearing a suit unbearable. I ducked into a boot shop just for the temporary air conditioning. *Buy one, get two free.* I couldn’t fathom how their business model worked, aside from extreme mark-ups. However, I’m sure my kids would be disappointed if I had come back with no souvenirs, and I was already near the back of the pack in the father-of-the-year race, flanked and ready to be overtaken by men who convinced their kids to reach under a lawn mower to pull a jam out of it, or guys who had gone for cigarettes and never come back. I selected a pink bejewelled pair for my daughter, a pair with red and blue on it that looked like it could have been spiderman licensed for my son, and the way the twenty-something female sales associate swooned at a pair of white python boots I tried on made me somehow swallow the four hundred dollar price tag. 

I left the store smiling, but in short order I decided to retreat to my Air BnB. The low hum that I had heard in the office was present again. The cube was calling to me. I could hear it even over the miles of bands playing Johnny Cash covers. I hustled back to my rental car and drove straight back to my accommodations.

When I burst through the door of the Air BnB condo, the hum was now so loud I could barely walk. I peeled off my suit and tore into the bathroom. My whole body began to shake. The noise had reached a crescendo to the point I felt as if my teeth were actually vibrating, as if I had rested my chin directly on a running metal grinder.

There was only one way to make it stop.

I searched around the bathroom counter and through my shaving kit for something sharp. Nothing could be found. Desperate, I smashed a bottle of Body Shop *White Musk for Men* cologne against the counter top, until I had a sufficiently sized shard of glass. 

The buzzing in my head had caused my vision to become blurry. White shimmering circles overtook my eyes until I could barely see what was in front of me.

I fell to my knees and crawled into the shower, turning the water to only cold. I began to cut my upper arms and legs. With each cut, the sound of the cube ringing in my head became slightly less. After the noise had sufficiently reduced, I ensured to make small superficial cuts, avoiding any significant veins or arteries, until the sound had nearly extinguished completely. 

*What the hell did it want from me now?*

I was exhausted. 

I stumbled out of the shower, drying myself with a towel that would end up being a sopping, bloody pink heap on the floor. 

I crawled into bed without treating my wounds. I could barely lift my arms or legs. I put in my earphones and turned up *Lamb of God*, sufficiently loud enough to drown out the pestilent hum, should it attempt to return.
