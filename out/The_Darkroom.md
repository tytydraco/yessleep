Photography had always been my passion. There’s something deeply satisfying about the quiet focus of the darkroom, the soft hum of the red light, the smell of developer filling the air as I watch an image slowly appear on paper. Film is truth to me, capturing each detail exactly as it is. But lately, the truth my camera reveals is something I can barely bring myself to face.

That's why I'm writing this now while the light is with me. I don't know how much time I have left or how much of my mind is already slipping away. It started with small things. Little jokes, I thought at first. I’d wake up and find my shoes on the bathroom counter, or my keys stashed in the fridge. A stack of books on the living room floor, arranged in a neat spiral. I knew I’d been sleepwalking, and I thought it was harmless. Maybe a little creepy, but mostly funny. I even laughed about it with friends, telling them about my “nighttime scavenger hunts.” One of them suggested I document it, see what I got up to while asleep. I’m a photographer, after all, so it seemed like a fun idea.

So I set out my favorite camera, a Leica M3 that was given to me after my father passed away. I left it on my nightstand, and each morning I’d find a few photos on the roll, taken by my own hand, of places I didn’t remember going and things I didn’t remember doing.

At first, the photos were tame. There was one of me staring into the fridge, eyes half-closed. Another showed me standing at the bathroom mirror, expression dazed. But as the weeks went on, the photos started to get…strange.

One morning, I developed the latest roll and found an image of me crouched on my living room floor, staring at the carpet with a wide, tight-lipped grin. The next photo was blurry, my face pressed up close to the lens, one eye wide open and unblinking. Another showed me standing by my bedroom window in the dead of night, staring out into the street. My face looked almost blank — no fear, no humor, just a vacant expression.

Then, two weeks later, I noticed news reports of missing children in my neighborhood. The fear I felt wasn’t rational, but it was immediate. I tried to convince myself it was a coincidence, just bad timing. But my mind kept circling back to those photos. I knew I’d been going outside. I knew I’d been leaving my apartment at night. And the camera was proof. But proof of what? Each morning, I’d develop my latest photos with a sick feeling of dread, wondering what I’d find.

One morning, the pictures made my blood run cold.

At first, it was more of the same—me standing in my hallway, my hand reaching for the doorknob. Another shot of me outside, on my street, barefoot in my pajamas, staring into the dark. But then I saw something that made my hands shake. In the background of one of the photos, just at the edge of the frame, was the small figure of a child. One of the missing children. They were standing in the shadows, half-turned toward me, their face streaked with tears.

The next shot was taken from the same spot, but closer. The child’s face was clearer now, and I could see the glistening track of tears on their cheek. Their hands were bound, and in the dim light, I could see a strip of cloth tied over their mouth, muffling their cries.

I nearly dropped the print, bile rising in my throat. I stumbled back from the table, feeling the room spin around me. This was more than sleepwalking. This was something I couldn’t even begin to understand.

Each day blurred into the next, a quiet dread settling in as I noticed how time slipped away. It crept up on me, disguised as exhaustion, until I finally saw the pattern: I was waking up later, dragging through fewer hours of daylight, only to fall into bed far earlier than ever before. My body, forced out each night under "his" command, was worn down. He was taking more of the day for himself, leaving me scraps of time to live in.

I leaned against the bathroom sink, staring at the reflection of a stranger. Hollow eyes stared back, ringed with dark circles that seemed bruised into my skin. My face had taken on a ghostly pallor, as though sickness itself had leeched into me, and my body ached with a deep, gnawing fatigue. The thought gripped me, cold and final: if this went on, he might consume me completely, leaving me to drift helplessly into a darkness from which I might never return.

Desperate, I stayed up for days, chugging coffee, anything to stay awake. I combed the surrounding woods, searching for any sign of them. I wandered miles each night, fueled by terror and shame. I knew I couldn’t rest until I’d found them, until I knew what I’d done. Days blurred into nights, and my body was numb, barely able to keep going. But still, I searched, unwilling to give up.

Then, just as dawn broke, I saw it. An old, decrepit hut, barely visible through the trees. I stumbled toward it, hands shaking, praying for a miracle.

Inside, the air was still and damp. In the center of the room was a small table with three tiny chairs, like something out of a child's playset. And on the table, as if waiting for me, was a single roll of undeveloped film.

I collapsed to my knees, the weight of my failure crushing me. I had been too late. The children, wherever they were, were lost to me. I sobbed until my throat was raw, my body shuddering as the last remnants of energy left me. Exhaustion finally caught up to me, and as the caffeine wore off, the darkness claimed me.

When I woke up, I was home, lying in my own bed. For a moment, I thought it might have been a nightmare. A horrible, feverish delusion. But as I made my way to the darkroom, I knew the truth. The photos were there, spread across the table, evidence of everything I’d done. The smell of developer was thick in the air, too real to ignore. And I could barely breathe as I took in the horror I had created.

My stomach twisted, and I fell to my knees, vomiting, my body convulsing with disgust. I could feel the weight of each image, each moment of terror. I gathered the photos, shoving them into an old shoebox, the edges of the prints biting into my fingers. I couldn’t live like this. I couldn’t let this monster inside me go on.

As I sit in my car outside the police station, I clutch the shoebox of photos like a lifeline. The weight of their horror presses down on me. My voice quivers at the thought of what I’ll say to the officer behind the desk. Will they believe me? Or will I be written off as a madman? I don’t care anymore. I still don’t know where the children are. Where he... where I hid them. I fear they may never be found, but I can’t allow this to continue. I pray those children are still alive. I pray that the photos I have can be used to find them. And I pray more than anything that I never sleep again.
