That afternoon, I had no idea where B was taking me.

B had been my best friend since preschool.

His real name was Mike, but for some reason everyone had always called him “B,” even back then.

Whenever I asked him why, he’d come up with a different story every time.

After a while, I just stopped caring — I only called him Mike when something was really serious.



Now, as second-year college students, we were still on the same course, still inseparable after all these years.

But that Friday night started differently than usual.

  


“Greg!” B burst through the door of my dorm room. “Greg, you have to see this! Come on, man, get up!”

  


I took off my headphones and glared at him, half annoyed. I was studying for next week’s exams, and the last thing I wanted was another one of his impulsive adventures.

  


“Greg,” B pleaded, putting on that pathetic face of his. “Dude, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!”

  


I kept the same blank stare, just to make sure he knew how much he was annoying me.

  


“Mike, listen,” I said once I realized he wasn’t leaving. “I really don’t have time for this right now—”

  


“Don’t start with that!” he interrupted. “Don’t ‘Mike’ me, man! We can’t skip this. Oh, and Greg… Emma’s coming too.”

  


I tried to play it cool. I knew B too well to think he was lying. 

But Emma... Emma was different. She’d been my crush for years, though I never had the guts to make a move.

And B knew that better than anyone. He knew that once her name came up, there was no way I could say no.

  


“B…” I sighed. “What exactly are we doing?”

  


That’s when B slapped a card down on my desk.

It looked more like an invitation than a business card — white, with five black symbols arranged in a circle: a bull, a rooster, a dog, a bird, and a human figure.

I just stared at him.

  


“Don’t tell me you don’t know what this is?” B asked, seeing my blank face.

  


I shook my head. I had no clue what kind of ‘invitation’ this was supposed to be.

When I picked up the card, the black shapes seemed to move for a second.

I blinked, and they were still — just smudges of ink again.

  


“Grab your coat,” B said. “I’ll explain on the way.”

  


The house we were heading to was in the suburbs.

And once B explained what we were going to see, I instantly regretted agreeing to come.



We were going to see the Bright Room.



I had no idea what that meant.

B only spoke in riddles — he kept saying things like, “we’ll watch the shadows,” “see the spirit world,” “witness the strange room.”

None of it made sense.

The only thing I was hoping for was that Emma would actually show up — and that B hadn’t just used her name to trick me into coming along.



When we got off the bus, we found ourselves in a deserted neighborhood.

It was the edge of the suburbs: neat, well-kept houses, but under the blanket of night, everything felt empty and lifeless.

  


“Come on, Greg,” B whispered. “It’s down there, at the end of the street.”

  


We only had to walk a few minutes. The next street looked the same — quiet, orderly, calm.

But in front of one house, where the porch light was still on, Emma was waiting.

She stood wrapped up in her coat, her pretty blonde hair half-covered by a knit cap.

Her thin, graceful face was tense as her eyes darted nervously around the dark street.



I waved from afar so she’d see it was us.

When she spotted me, I could tell she relaxed a little — relieved she wouldn’t have to stand there alone in the dark anymore.

  


“Hey, Em,” I said softly once we reached her.

  


“Hey, Greg,” she replied with that warm, sweet voice of hers. “I was starting to think you weren’t coming.”

  


“Yeah, yeah, hey, Emma,” B cut in, brushing her off. “Alright, what are we waiting for? Let’s go in.”

  


Emma and I exchanged a look — that silent kind of glance that said everything.

I knew B had dragged her into this madness too. He’d convinced her to take part in whatever this was — probably just to make sure I’d come along.



B was already at the front door, pressing the doorbell. It opened almost immediately.



The man who opened it wasn’t exactly reassuring.

He was tall and thin, his head shaved completely bald. His eyes looked tired, yet sharp and watchful. He stood there shirtless — even though it was the middle of winter.

But the worst thing was the collar around his neck.

It was made of leather, decorated with golden etchings.

Around it, engraved in a pattern, were the same five symbols from the card.

  


“Tickets?” the man rasped in a hoarse, metallic voice.

  


B instantly pulled the card from his pocket — the same one he’d shown me earlier — and handed it to him.

The tall man inspected it carefully, then stepped aside without a word, gesturing for us to enter.



B hurried inside first.

Emma and I hesitated for a moment, then followed, uneasy and uncertain.

  


There were already quite a few people waiting inside.

Some were around our age, others looked rough, shady even — an old man, a few ordinary folks.

There must’ve been about twenty of us gathered in that large living room.



The place looked like it belonged to some elderly lady. The furniture had to be a hundred years old, at least. But the first thing that caught my attention was the strange door.

From the living room, you could go into the kitchen, or into another room — the one with the locked door.

But this door was covered in symbols again — not just the door itself, but the wall around it too, painted over in white markings that circled it like a frame.

Em gripped my arm tightly. I could tell she was scared. Honestly, so was I.

  


“Mike…” I whispered to him. “Where the hell did you bring us?”

  


“Sit,” said the tall man who had appeared behind us.

  


B didn’t answer. He just dropped onto one of the nearby couches.

Em and I followed his lead. A man was already sitting there, smoking a cigarette.

I could see the tension on his face — he looked like someone waiting for something he’d started to regret.



Then, suddenly, a large wall clock chimed loudly.

Em and I both flinched. B, on the other hand, sat there like an excited little kid, eager for what was coming next.



The tall man glanced at the clock, then walked over to a small cabinet.

I sat frozen on the couch, barely breathing. The apartment was stiflingly warm, but I didn’t dare take off my coat. Em kept glancing at me nervously, as if hoping I had answers.

The tall man stepped in front of the group — standing just before the strange door, while the rest of us sat in a half-circle around him.

  


“One A.M.,” he said calmly. “We begin.”

  


I shot a nervous look at Mike. I was pissed.

How the hell did he think this was going to be fun? And why did he have to drag Emma into this bullshit?

  


“You will draw,” the man continued. “Once everyone has drawn, we’ll reveal them together.”

  


He reached into the cabinet and pulled out a black cloth bag.

Then he started walking around, stopping in front of each person so they could draw something from it.



Each one pulled out a small folded piece of paper, sealed shut with tape, all identical in size.

When it was our turn, I hesitated before sticking my hand into the bag. Emma’s hand trembled as she reached in. I couldn’t tell if it was fear — or that deep instinct that told her this was a mistake.

The tall, half-naked man stepped back into the center of the half-circle.

  


“Now,” he said quietly. “You may open them.”

  


Most people tore theirs open right away.

A chorus of frustrated groans followed — like gamblers losing their final bets.

Mike ripped his open too.

His paper was blank. B slammed his hand down on the arm of the couch like an angry child.

  


“Goddammit,” he growled. “Yours empty too, Greg?”

  


I finally looked down at mine. Slowly unfolded it.

On the paper, among the strange symbols, was the figure of a man.

Just a black, crude outline — like something drawn on a cave wall, still glistening as if the ink were wet.

  


“You’ve gotta be kidding me,” B muttered, angrier now. “You didn’t even wanna come, and you get picked? Want to trade, Greg?”

  


I opened my mouth to say sure, take it — anything to get out of this creepy cult crap — But the tall man cut in before I could speak. I hadn’t even noticed him move closer.

  


“No trades,” he said flatly. “We have the Man… and the Rooster.”

  


I turned toward Emma. She had opened hers too. On her paper was the rooster.

Mike looked furious — like a kid who’d just been left out of a game.

  


“If I’m not mistaken,” the tall man said, stepping back to the center, “we have everyone we need.”

  


Most of the fancy crowd left. Anyone who'd drawn a blank slip and had no reason to stick around basically walked out right away. B stayed with us. He sat on the couch, sulking, clutching our coats until we could finally take them off.



The five of us were now standing in the small semicircle where the half-naked man had been. He’d gone upstairs, said he’d be right back — ten minutes passed, then twenty — and he still hadn’t come down.



The five of us in the middle were the ones who’d pulled the marked papers tonight. I’d drawn the Man. Em had the Rooster. A young, pimply kid got the Bull; a middle-aged woman with a severe face had the Dog; and finally, a big bearded guy held the Bird.

I looked at them, half-expecting somebody to say something useful. Instead, they all wore the same blank, worried expression — nobody knew what was coming next.



The tall, half-naked man finally returned and planted himself in front of us, carrying a heavy wooden box. He didn’t say a word; he just set it down and opened it.

Inside, it was lined with velvet; the velvet had five little compartments, each separated from the others. Nestled in those compartments were small black wooden figurines — the same ones from the cards.



The tall man still didn’t speak. I watched, tense, wondering what this ritual even meant. He gently took the wooden figures out one by one and handed each to the person who’d drawn the corresponding paper.

When he finished he closed the box and faced us.

  


“Now you will see what few get to see,” he said, cold as ice. “But there are rules. Break them, and this won’t end well.”

  


“Excuse me,” the bearded man interrupted. “Nobody told us we could die over this.”

  


“That’s why there are rules,” the tall man said, expressionless. “The most important rule: once you place the figurine, you do not move it. The second: once I lock the door on you, I do not open it until you say the proper phrase. In any other case, the door stays shut.”

  


Em squeezed my arm again. I could see she was terrified, and I felt it too — every hair on my neck was standing up. I kept thinking the same thing: I shouldn’t have come. Mike is going to get us all into deep shit.



The tall man explained the rest of the rules.



The whole idea was that he’d lock us inside the strange room — the one with the painted door.

Once inside, we had to place the figurine we’d been given, and then watch the shadow that appeared. But we weren’t allowed to look away. Not even for a second.

  


“Everyone understands?” the half-naked man asked.

  


We all nodded timidly. I don’t think anyone really understood what this was. Maybe it was just some elaborate prank meant to freak us out.

  


“Then the last thing,” the tall man said, stepping up beside the strange door. “Each of you has a sentence. The phrase that will let you out. You simply say what you are, and that you want to leave.”

  


I glanced around, wary. Everyone had that same uneasy expression — like we were all questioning why the hell we were still there.

  


“For example,” the tall man cleared his throat, “so it’s clear — this is what you say: ‘I am the bird. I would like to come out.’ If I don’t hear those words, I don’t open the door.”

  


Everyone gave nervous smiles and nodded, like obedient schoolchildren, or tourists laughing at a bad tour guide joke.

  


“One exception,” the tall man said, pointing straight at me. “The Man. The Man does not speak. The Man endures. Understood?”

  


“I—uh… wait, what?” I stammered, though I don’t even know why I tried to respond.

  


“The Man says nothing,” he repeated. “The Man waits. He must remain inside for five minutes, no more, no less.”

  


I swallowed hard. I knew I should’ve walked out right then, but my legs felt rooted to the floor. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Em go pale as snow. She was scared for me — and part of me found comfort in that — but my stomach twisted into knots at the sound of his words.

  


“Now then,” the tall man continued calmly, “if everything’s clear… Behold the wonder.”

  


Then he reached for the handle and opened the strange door.



Everyone was waiting for something big to happen, maybe someone would jump out of the room, or some cheap scare would make us all scream and laugh. Then we’d chuckle about it, and everyone would go home.



But there was nothing like that inside the room. In fact, there was nothing at all.

It was a small, almost completely empty space — like someone had cleared out a bedroom until not a single thing remained.

The walls were freshly painted white, smooth and spotless.

The only thing in the room was a single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling — no fixture, no shade, just a bulb, dangling right in the center. Its harsh glow was so bright it almost burned your eyes if you looked at it too long.

  


“The first,” said the tall man firmly. “The first is always the Bird. He begins the path.”

  


The bearded man hesitated. I could see he was terrified — but so were the rest of us.

You could tell by the silence and the way no one moved: every one of us regretted coming here tonight.

  


“The verse must be spoken,” the tall man said. “We have brought out the relics. The verse cannot be left unsaid.”

  


Em shot me a questioning look — she wanted me to tell her what was going on.

But I just shook my head. I had no idea what any of this meant, or what that strange man was talking about.

The bearded man took a deep breath, then stepped up to the door.

  


“What do I have to do?” he asked, glancing between the empty room and the man standing by the door.

  


“Just go in, little bird,” said the half-naked man calmly. “Place your figurine on the black mark. Follow the rules. I’ll handle the rest.”

  


The bearded man nodded.

A bead of sweat rolled down his forehead. Then, swallowing hard, he stepped into the room.



Nothing happened.

You’d expect something — the man to collapse, the door to slam shut — but there was only silence.

He simply knelt and placed the tiny black bird figurine in the center of the floor.

The room didn’t change. Not even a flicker of the light.

  


“The bird flies through the night,” the strange man said in a low, rhythmic tone — almost like reciting a poem — and slowly, gently, he closed the door.

  


Time felt like it had stopped.

The silence was suffocating. We couldn’t hear a single sound from inside the room — not even a shuffle, not a breath.

And then, suddenly…

  


“I… I am…” — it was the bearded man’s voice, but it kept breaking. “I am… I am the bird… please, let me out…”

  


The half-naked man had been standing there, perfectly still, as if waiting for that moment. The instant he heard the words, he stepped forward and swiftly opened the door.



The bearded man stood there exactly as he had been when the door closed on him. Inside the room, there was nothing — nothing but him and the little black figurine.

The white walls still gleamed under the harsh, blinding light.



But the man was crying. Not just tearing up — sobbing. Like a child. I had never seen a grown man cry like that before.

No one said a word. He stumbled out of the room, wiping his face, sniffling through his tears.

  


“I know, I know,” said the tall man softly, patting his back as he passed. “The Bird weighs heavy on the soul. But you are free now.”

  


“Greg… I don’t want to go in,” came a whisper.

  


The shock of it all had made me miss how badly Em was shaking. The fear on her face was unbearable. And as much as I wanted to protect her, to pull her out of this nightmare, I had no idea what to say.

  


“What did you see?” someone from the half-circle asked.

  


The bearded man was still fighting back tears, then silently walked toward the kitchen. A woman from the group got up and followed him.

  


“I believe the next is the Rooster,” the tall man said calmly, his eyes shifting to Emma.

  


Em didn’t move.

She just stared ahead, clutching the small wooden rooster in her trembling hands.

  


“Uh… sir, I think…” I started when she still didn’t react. “I think maybe we’ll sit this one out.”

  


The man’s face didn’t change. He just looked straight through me, as if I weren’t even there.

  


“There is no ‘sitting out,’” he said after a long silence. “The verse must be completed. Otherwise, we will all be in danger.”

  


“I don’t know about that…” I began —

  


“It’s okay, Greg,” Em interrupted softly. “I can do this.”

  


I looked at her. She was still shaking, still terrified — but I could tell something in her had steadied. So I nodded.



Em stepped into the room.

The tall man retrieved the small bird figurine from the center of the floor. Em knelt and placed her wooden rooster in its place, right on the mark.

  


“The Rooster calls, and silence comes,” the strange man intoned, again in that eerie, rhythmic voice.

  


Then, slowly, calmly, he closed the door.



Em looked back at me one last time. Her wide brown eyes met mine — full of fear.

  


Everyone was holding their breath again.

I was terrified for Em, and I could tell the others were just as tense — no one even dared to move. The tall man stood by the door, staring blankly into space, yet his posture made it clear he was ready — waiting for the moment she’d say the words that would let her out.



Then someone screamed.



The sound came from inside the room, but it echoed strangely — as if it were trapped within metal walls.

It was Em. I knew her voice instantly.



Then she screamed again.

Before I could stop myself, I rushed toward the door. But the tall man reacted instantly.



“We don’t open it!” he barked, stepping in front of the door. “Not until she says the words!”

  


“Get the hell out of my way!” I yelled furiously.

  


I tried to shove him aside, but the moment my hand touched his shoulder, he twisted my arm in one brutal motion and slammed me to the floor.

  


“Ahh!” Em cried from inside. “Help me! Somebody, please!”

  


Her voice was high and broken, almost shrieking with panic. She was screaming, pounding, clawing at the door.

  


“Em!” I shouted back from the floor.

  


The tall man didn’t loosen his grip.

He was thin, but impossibly strong — I couldn’t move an inch. The others just stared in shock. No one moved. I saw it in their faces: they were frozen in fear, every single one of them. Even Mike — pale as a ghost — sat curled up on the couch, doing nothing.

  


“Greg!” Em screamed. “Greg, help me! Please, let me out!”

  


“Let her out!” I bellowed, my throat burning.

  


The man didn’t flinch. He just twisted my arm tighter until I cried out in pain.

Em was still screaming, hammering the door so hard I thought it would break off its hinges.

  


“Let me out!” she cried. “Please! Somebody open the door!”

  


“This isn’t her,” the tall man said calmly, still holding me down.

  


And suddenly — everything stopped. The banging. The screams. Silence.

Then came her voice again — soft, trembling, but… wrong.

  


“I am,” she said gently. “I am the Rooster. Please, open the door.”

  


The tall man released me at once and sprang to his feet.

In one fluid motion, he opened the door — as if it had never been locked at all.



And there she was. Em stood in the middle of the room.

  


“We need to get the hell out of here,” I snapped. “This is fucking insane.”

  


We were sitting in the kitchen now — Mike, Em, and me.

  


“We can’t,” B muttered. “Greg… I’m sorry. We can’t leave.”

  


I glared at him.

  


“What do you mean, can’t?” I growled.

  


“Greg…” B sighed, his voice low and guilty. “That guy locks everything when it starts. There’s no way out until he opens the doors again.”

  


I stared at Mike, furious. How could he drag us into this shit? Em was covered in scratches, and we still had no idea what was going on in that damned room.

  


“Mike,” I hissed. “You’ve been here before, haven’t you?”

  


He just nodded. And for a second, I honestly wanted to punch him in the face.

  


“Guys…” Em whispered. “Please. Just stop.”

  


She didn’t look good.

Her face and arms were covered in thin red marks — deep scratches. It looked like she’d done it to herself, but I couldn’t believe that. Something was wrong in that room.



Em didn’t remember anything that had happened while she was inside. She said that once the door closed, it felt like something had shut her mind off — like something knew that what happens in there can’t be shared. It belongs only to the one inside.

  


“So what now?” I muttered.

  


“The ritual continues,” B said quickly. “He says the verse, each person with a figurine goes in, and when it’s done… he opens the doors.”

  


“This is bullshit,” I shot back. “Look at Em, Mike! Look what they did to her! What do you think they’ll do to me?”

  


“It’s not that bad, Greg,” Em said softly, brushing her hand across the scratches on her arm.

“They don’t hurt. Not really.”

  


“You’ll be fine, Greg,” Mike added.

  


“Oh, shut the fuck up, Mike!” I barked. “If you’re so damn smart, then tell me what happens! What did they do to Em? What’s going to happen to me?”

  


“Greg…” Em murmured, trying to calm me down.

  


“Greg,” Mike interrupted, “it’s always like this with the Rooster.”

  


“What?” I snapped.

  


“Every time I’ve been here,” Mike said, “whoever got the Rooster — they always came out a little shaken up. That guy says the Rooster’s wild… but at least it’s free.”

  


“What kind of bullshit is that,” I muttered under my breath.

  


“That’s how it’s always been,” B said grimly. “He recites the verse, people go in… the only one that changes is the Man. That one’s never the same.”

  


I was about to ask what the hell he meant — what verse? what are you talking about? — when the tall man appeared in the kitchen doorway.

  


“The Man is next,” he said coldly. “It’s time.”

  


I was already standing inside the room. The small black figurine — shaped like a man — lay at my feet.



It took everything in me to step inside. Especially after seeing what had happened to the others.



The strict-looking woman with the dog figurine had stayed behind in the living room.

An older man sat beside her, rubbing her back, while she just stared blankly into the distance.

The young boy who had drawn the bull was stretched out on the couch, his legs propped up — he must’ve fainted at some point.

The tall man just stood there, cold and silent, waiting for me to go in.

It was Em who finally convinced me. I didn’t want her to see how scared I really was. I tried to make my irritation look like worry for her. But inside, I was terrified.



The room itself felt… repulsive.

As the door closed behind me, panic began to rise in my chest. I could still hear the tall man’s final words:

  


“The Man stands, and waits for the shadow.”

  


Then the door shut completely.



The little lightbulb above me glowed harshly. I stood there, frozen, just watching. But nothing happened. Not a sound. Not a movement.

Is this all some kind of joke? I thought. But then I remembered Em’s wounds.

Something moved. The figurine’s shadow began to stretch —longer, and longer still.

It crept across the floor, up the opposite wall.



A large, dark blotch formed on the white paint — a black stain that began to shift and spread.

A tear rolled down my cheek. I don’t even know why. The dark shape started to take form — and slowly, it became a man.



He stood there in front of me, like my own shadow come alive. But the light hung directly above my head — it was impossible that it was mine.



The figure reached out his hand. At first I thought it was toward me. But then, on the right wall, a child’s shadow appeared — a little girl, running. Her movements were slow, as if the distance between them was endless.

When she finally reached him, the two embraced. Then they both turned to face me.

Neither had a face. Both were just black shapes. And yet I could feel their gaze on me.

They knew I was there.



Then, together, they raised their arms and pointed upward.

At the ceiling.

At the glowing light above me.

I looked up slowly. The bulb buzzed softly in the silent room.

The two figures were still there — but now, they were motioning for me to come closer.

  


I didn’t move.

I just stared back.



Then the girl seemed to whisper something to the man. And with slow, mime-like motions, she began to run toward me. Her shadow moved without moving — as if she were sprinting in place.



Suddenly, her shadow stretched, reaching across the floor toward me. I tried to step back, but it caught my hand. I felt something soft wrap around my fingers — a gentle squeeze, like the touch of a real child.

The light flickered. It pulsed, dimmed, and buzzed as if it were about to die.

I felt the girl pulling my hand.

Somewhere, a voice cried out in anguish.

Then, for an instant, everything went black.



The door burst open.

The tall man stood there, looking at me from the living room. There was something different in his face now — almost… joy.



I stepped out. Everyone stared at me in shock, as if someone famous had just stepped out of a wardrobe… or maybe Jesus himself.



Em rushed to me.

She said something — but I couldn’t make out the words. Her voice sounded muffled, as if coming from underwater.

I looked into her eyes, tears blurring my vision.

And I realized — she wasn’t the same person anymore.

But then again, neither was I.
