Ghosting, it’s annoying, isn’t it? I feel there is no word that exists in the dictionary of any known language and no sentence which has been said or will ever be said, that is hurtful enough to me than simple *silence.* 

This is probably the reason why whenever I get no prolonged ‘no responses’ after I send a couple of texts, I get extremely annoyed. *‘Like dude, stop chickening out and tell me you don’t want to talk!’* After that would follow a barrage of angry texts from me which has often ruined *(completely or partially)* many friendships of mine. 

It is hence quite ironic that the first time I learned restraint in the face of getting ghosted was when it was done to me by the girl with whom I am currently deeply in love. She, being a good and long-time friend of mine made me see no problem in confessing my feelings to her, and such also made her see no problem in telling me that she is not mentally prepared for any sort of relationship at that point. 

I felt crushed, no pun intended and refused to have any further conversation with her for the entirety of that day. The next day, I analyzed this situation from a saner perspective and arrived at the conclusion that the priority was to now save this friendship with her. I texted her with the usual, ‘hey, do you want to talk about what happened?’ No reply. I texted her again saying how I will be willing to listen to whatever she had to say to me. Upon further no replies, I felt a sense of fear as opposed to anger. Maybe I didn’t want to know what she had to say. Maybe I for the first time realized that sometimes, people simply needed time before communicating, and sometimes I did too.

So, I took a break from her. Whether she still is a friend or not, as of now I have been rejected, and getting rejected hurts. So, I declared that I will from then on focus on myself. I will join a gym, eat healthily, start journaling my cliché heartbreak journey, and most importantly I will ask everyone who has ever owed me money to pay it back. 

I received 1000 rupees in a couple of hours, and I was expecting to receive 600 more in a couple of hours once Natasha, the only remaining person to pay me, sees my message. Trust, me guys it’s that simple to get your money back. No shame in asking.

Three hours passed and no reply from Natasha. I decided to call her. I rang her number, no response. ‘I will try after a while I thought to myself. Two hours passed and I see her online on Instagram. I decide it’s best to send her a dm. Twenty-minute pass. The message was not replied to or even read. She went offline. A familiar anger took hold of me.

‘This woman had no problem in asking me for 600 rupees and when I want it back, she chooses to ignore me?’ I tried to use restraint. 'She must be busy. I will ask her the next day.' I thought to myself. 

The next day I must have called about five times followed by two WhatsApp texts and three DMs on her Instagram. I even contemplated sending her the song ‘Bitch better have my money by Rihanna’ but later decided against it as that might be taken as rude. Anyways, it was not that she can simply forget about paying me back. 600 rupees is a large sum, feel free to convert it into your country’s currency. At this point I should mention that she was a friend from university, we were then on our winter break, and she lived in a different state from mine so I couldn’t just show up at her front door. 

An array of thoughts circled through my mind. ‘How is it humanly possible to unsee so many texts? She did come online on Instagram a couple of times so she must have seen at least some DMs. She definitely is using her phone so those WhatsApp messages must also have been received by her. Is she doing this on purpose? Why would she? We are good friends, the last time I talked everything seemed normal and most importantly, I didn’t recall telling her that I like her either.’ I took a deep sigh.

‘I am overthinking this.’ I told to myself. To hell with the 600 rupees. I will speak to her once the break is over. I decided to forget about all this. ‘What exactly was the last thing she talked to me about?’ I wondered as I decided to leave for my evening workout session. ‘What did she mean by she had a crazy stalker who wanted to…” 

I felt chill run down my spine. The thought that came in my mind made me freeze with a sense of fear. 

“No, I am definitely thinking too much.” I decided to completely shut off my mind and just head toward the gym. It was when I was tying my shoelace with my shaky fingers that my phone rang. I leaped towards it and maybe I am the only few people in this world to have ever felt dismayed upon seeing the caller was ‘the girl whom I liked.’ 

“Hello…?” I said in a confused tone.

“Hey, how are you?”

“Good….what’s up?”

“Can you do me a small favor and call Natasha? She is not picking up my phone.”

I felt a tightness in my chest.

“Umm….she is not picking up my phone either.”

“Oh, no worries then. By the way, do you want to…you know…have a conversation about what happened?”

I let down another sigh and told her ‘Some other time’ before hanging up.

What followed was me calling almost every mutual friend of mine and Natasha’s to see if anyone got any response from her in the last few days. *No one did.*

I decided to stop thinking of her completely, forget this situation, and just go back to my normal life. “What did she mean by a stalker? Is she in trouble?”

I decided to call it a day and go to sleep. I was far too drained to work out that day.
