I’m a wetland surveyor at a national wildlife refuge in the Pacific Northwest. Our refuge is remote; it takes about 40 minutes to get to the nearest small town by car. Because of this, we have a bunkhouse on site that employees can choose to live in, the rent is dirt cheap and the only downside is being far from civilization. It’s a rather nice place though, and during the summer is packed full of seasonal employees. But, in the winter it's just me, since everyone else has a place in town. Our office is very small, with only 7 other staff, though during this time of year it’s usually a skeleton crew as people make use of their stockpiled “use or lose” PTO hours. 

Anyways, since I live on site, walking over to the office takes about 5 minutes. Once there I unlock the doors and disable the alarm. I’m almost always the first one in, so I head over to the kitchen and make a pot of coffee. In the summer, I usually just pour a cup into my thermos and am out the door within 30 minutes, but in the winter I get more down time. The light takes about an hour to come out, so I just sit and peaceably drink my coffee checking emails. I check the weather to decide if it’ll be an office or fieldwork day. The forecast says there’ll be a bit of snow, but that doesn’t bother me. I usually only stay in if it says it will rain, I kind of like working in the snow and figure I can just head in early if it gets too crazy.

The light starts to break, so I sign out the keys to a government truck and mark down on a whiteboard that I’m “out,” anticipating to be back by end of day (around 4:30 PM). I don’t usually actually stay out that late, but when I do come in is extremely variable depending on how far into the refuge I’m going, so I just say end of day to avoid any stress when I inevitably come in much later than I’d put on the board. Plus, I’m typically in “SOS” cell phone reception areas so the only way to really contact me is by radio, which I have in case of an emergency. But I keep it turned off so I don’t have to listen to random chatter all day, not that the line would be all that busy at this time of year though.

Regardless, I pulled on my neoprene muck boots, packed my bag (with water, lunch, binoculars, and a first aid kit), and set off for the truck. The refuge is split up into a bunch of smaller named quadrants, visitor use is only allowed on a small portion of the east side, and only along marked trails. I’d already surveyed most of the eastern side, barring a spot in the northern part where we were going to start a logging operation. So, I decided to go to the western area, which was even more remote than the parts of the refuge I was most familiar with. I decided to start at the most southwest point and work myself across, describing wetlands as I went. Essentially, my job is to mark down a laundry list of things about each wetland, such as what type of plants are within the wetland and around it, and of course, if the wetland is currently “wet.” In the winter they usually are, this is the rainy season here. 

Typically, wetlands are surrounded by pine trees and occasionally aspen, and have cattail, bulrush, or reed canary grass (an invasive species) within the basin itself. For me, my primary interest is whether or not a wetland has aspen, as we are attempting to boost their numbers. They are slowly being choked out of the landscape by an increasingly dense forest of pine trees, so the only place we really see aspen anymore is alongside wetlands where they can get enough sunlight and water. Unfortunately, this also exposes them directly to our overabundant elk population, which find aspen to be particularly delicious, and love to bed down in the wetlands for shelter.

For the most part, I am the only person, at least among the current staff, but probably in total, who has ever visited most of these wetlands. When I started my position I was given a shapefile of rough polygons that someone had at some point digitized from aerial imagery. Over time I refined these shapes in the field and added my own, both spotted from aerial maps and found in the field. Suffice to say, staff have been to some of the larger wetlands on the east side extensively, as those are the public facing wetlands, but have probably never had reason to hike to anything this far out. I say hike because there aren’t any roads in this part of the refuge, just a wide enough space by the fence where I could park the truck off the main road.

As I got out of the car I zipped up my coat, put my iPad around my neck, then locked the truck and put the keys in the gas cap. It’s just what everyone does here, I’m sure there’s a good reason for it. The forest I was about to enter looked about the same as on the more public side. Pines spilling over the landscape jostling each other for space, only various unidentifiable types of dry yellow and brown grasses in between them. The ground is cold and hard, both because it is interwoven with a mosaic of dark basaltic rock from eruptions millions of years prior, and because the frost has locked the soils together. My iPad has a built in GPS, and shows me the way forward towards the first wetland. As a general rule when hiking alone you should always try and make noise so the animals know you’re coming. I was told to talk to myself, and sometimes I sing songs, but usually I just put on a podcast, which also does a better job of kicking the boredom I get hiking about for 6+ hours each day.

I hop the rusty barbed wire fence and venture into the woods towards my first wetland. Time moves faster in the woods it seems, I imagine because the memory of the same activity being accomplished over and over again for hours is compressed. My podcast has rolled over into its fifth episode, and after the sixth wetland I’ve been hiking for about 6 hours. It takes me half an hour to an hour at least to assess each wetland, depending on the size, but I’m certainly at least an hour or two's walk into the woods. The most notable thing that has happened in all that time was my startling of a moose bedding down in wetland number three. It was a cow moose and slowly lumbered away. As a rule if I see a moose in a wetland I simply walk the other way, but as she was intent on leaving I stayed and surveyed once she was farther off, and marked in my notes that I observed a moose using the wetland.

I still had plenty of time left in the day. In the summer I wouldn’t work outside past 1:00 PM because of the heat, but in the winter I could work outside all day if I wanted to, depending on the weather. I figured I was in a good position to start doubling back and hitting wetlands on my way to the truck. I started double checking I’d filled out all the data fields for my current wetland, but just then, I heard a rustling noise at the far end of the basin about 50 feet away. I immediately paused my podcast and hunkered down near some cattail. There was something moving in the wetland, I waited to see what it was. After about 30 seconds, I saw a massive pair of antlers rise out of the cattails. It was a Rocky Mountain elk, “the scourge of the aspens” I thought jokingly. I’d never really gotten close enough to see one for more than a few seconds, in my experience they are way more skittish than moose and bolt before you get anywhere near them. They really are beautiful animals. I sneakily took a photo on the iPad and marked that I saw a “bull elk bedding down in the wetland (see photo).” I watched it for a few moments before I realized that I should definitely take a photo on my own phone.

But by the time I got my phone out it had moved behind a pine, it seemed to be looking at something nearby. I followed its gaze and saw an aspen stand I had noted down earlier. It began to walk towards the congregation of trees, beautifully bright in summer, but in winter merely skeletal limbs reaching towards the sky. Aspen are white trees with dark, almost eye shaped, spots similar to birches, but when they grow new limbs they produce skinny red spears with tasty buds tipping each end. I considered revealing myself and scaring the elk away, all I’d need to do is rustle a few cattails and it would probably bolt. But, I also wanted a nice photo of a bull elk chowing down on some aspen. I figured it would be a great picture to use for a presentation on elk browsing at the refuge. So I waited, but I never got my photo. Right as the elk extended towards the aspen bud something dark as tar whipped out of a hole in the ground and gripped its throat. It happened in an instant. I heard the elk attempt to bark a warning call but it only got out a second before its body was effortlessly pulled downwards, its neck cracking brutally on some hard lip above the opening. 

For several minutes I heard cracking bones and the gooey sounds of crushing flesh. It was clear to me whatever I had just seen was breaking the elk down. I began to feel sick and covered my ears in an attempt to stop myself from puking, but to no avail. I began to retch and puked up the elk stew I’d eaten the night before. My boss had brought some in for a party a few days back, and allowed me the leftovers. I tried to be as quiet as possible as broth, vegetables, and chunks of half digested meat flew onto the cold soil. I could feel my stomach muscles contracting over and over again to push out every last drop of fluid until I sat on my side dry heaving and gasping next to a large puddle made up of the night before.

With tears in my eyes I pulled away from the acidic and meaty stench and regained my awareness. Vomit was still permeating my senses and I realized it was in my beard and on my clothes. The promised snow began to fall in heavy flakes as I looked over at the aspen stand, suddenly panicking. But there was no aspen stand, only a pile of red mush on the ground in its place. I hastily searched my surroundings and immediately saw a flash of white advancing to my left, immediately it stopped. It was the aspen stand, now only 20 feet in front of me. I heard a grinding sound coming from within it, and then it began to sway towards me. The stand was about 10 feet across, and on a mound of material 6 feet in height. I’m 5’ 8” in height, so it was just a bit taller than me. I stopped looking at the aspen, and looked at what it was situated on. It appeared to be on soil interlaced with basaltic rocks, exactly what I myself was standing on for the most part. 

But it was moving, ever so slowly, towards me. I took a step forward, and the grinding intensified, but the mound of rocks and soil and trees stopped. I considered trying to intimidate it, but I was too afraid to move any closer and didn’t want to start yelling just yet, so I began to back away carefully. It followed me but stopped when it reached my pool of vomit. The grinding stopped in tandem, and I was horrified to see multiple dark prong like pinchers extend out of what under normal circumstances I would have assumed to be a large coyote den. They covered themselves in the bile as much as they could and then retracted inwards. The mound shuddered and immediately grew ravenous, dipping more appendages into the liquid until there was nothing left visible. It may have taken a minute to do so, and I had continued to back away. I was terrified and knew that I was much too far away from the road, and that I had left my iPad by the pool of vomit. I had pulled it off my neck immediately once I started puking.

Regardless, I knew the way to go. Wetlands tend to form in somewhat straight lines here and I could get back as long as I followed the wetlands I had just surveyed back. Plus, I still had my phone in my jacket pocket if need be. I had regained about 20 feet on the mound when it began to advance on me, no longer as tentative as before. I saw the aspen stand rise up as glittering black legs extended underneath the mound. The aspen stand was now suspended by seemingly hundreds of prong-like appendages that began to rush the mound towards me, blasting through any pines in its wake. I booked it and ran as fast as I could but it was clear to me it would catch up quickly. I began sweating through my jacket and decided that I needed to do something or I wasn’t going to make it much farther. I wiped the sweat and vomit off my face and beard as best I could onto my coat and threw it to the side, immediately hearing a crash to my left that I assume meant it had taken the bait, and was much closer behind me than I had realized.

Immediately I felt the cold bite into me. It was about 30 degrees out but my body was sweating with exertion and adrenaline and I really didn’t feel it after a while. I kept running and running and running and running and running until eventually I hit a road. It must've taken hours, as I had almost immediately given up on running straight down the line of wetlands once the thing had begun to chase me. But I had found the road. My truck was nowhere to be seen. The sky was darkening, and I knew I must've been lost for a good deal of time. I knew I’d run more or less at a diagonal away from the wetlands that were supposed to guide me back and figured the refuge was probably closer than my truck. Plus, there was no chance I was going to head back in that thing’s direction, even if I had shaken it. 

I knew I wouldn’t have service but figured I’d try anyway, so I reached for my phone… only to remember I’d left it in my jacket pocket. I shrugged, I had had no intention of throwing out my jacket until the moment I’d done so. For whatever reason, I felt safer jogging along the road. So much so that I tried taking a break and walking, but realized I needed to keep moving my joints or I might stop moving altogether from the exhaustion and cold. I still had a few layers on, one of them thermal, but without my winter coat the cold had been steadily creeping into me. I had also lost my beanie at some point. It was at that moment I remembered I had a radio, I’d never once used it before but pulled it out eagerly. I switched it on, it was already preset to the refuge channel. 

“Hello! Anyone at HQ? I need someone to pick me up I’m on the main road heading… probably North towards the refuge entrance. I’ve been attacked by something and I’ve lost my jacket and cell phone. I’m very cold and I… need help.” 

I stopped. “Hello?” I said weakly. I sighed, left the radio on, and attached it back to my pack. I took a sip of my water bottle, still amazingly lukewarm from being inside my pack, and continued on the road. No cars ever passed me, but in the end it didn’t matter, because I found the refuge entrance somewhat quickly. It was still a 30 minute walk from there, but at last I knew I’d be okay. When I made it back to the office there weren’t any cars. In fact, I had no idea if anyone had even come into work that day. I probably should have waited longer to see before I headed out. I tried the office door but it was locked. I put my hands in my pocket and put my head against the small rectangular window, my breath fogging up the glass. I had lost my keys too, it seemed. But, before I could panic I remembered I always left the side door of the bunkhouse open, even though I’ve been expressly told not to do so for security reasons. 

“Just a little bit farther,” I told myself aloud. I shambled to the side door and opened it, immediately relishing the warmth I felt. I pushed the thermostat to maximum, pulled a blanket over myself, and fell asleep on the couch within minutes.

I woke up and felt soreness and hunger immediately. Sunlight was streaming in from the blinds and I reached for my phone, when suddenly my memories came rushing back to me. My head ached as I gathered my thoughts, and I tried to figure out what I would tell everyone. I’m sure I must look terrible so they’d have to believe some of it. I decided I’d just tell them the truth. If they thought I was crazy so be it, after all it's not like I’m going to continue working here. I figured that I at least needed to warn everyone there was something out there before I hightailed it. 

But before that, I needed a shower, some coffee, and a nice meal. I cleaned myself up and quickly scarfed down a whole tub of cold leftover pasta, not exactly a nice meal, but still filling. Then I set the oven to 400 degrees for a frozen pizza and put on a pot of coffee. I decided to see who was in today, and opened the blinds that pointed toward HQ. Immediately, I had to look away from the blinding white in front of me. When my eyes adjusted I collapsed to the floor.

“No… but I got away,” I said softly. “I made it home”

Surrounding me were bright white limbs stretching upwards towards the sky. I opened all the blinds in the living room, and they were behind every one. I was surrounded, in a great big aspen stand. There were so many stems I couldn’t even see headquarters, even though it was just a few minutes down the road. The trees were still, and I saw long abandoned bird nests in many of them. Strangely, despite being barren of leaves these were some of the most vibrant and tall aspens I had ever seen. I guess nothing ever got the chance to take even a single bite. Tears streaming down my face I went to my pack and pulled out my radio, went to turn it on but realized it was still on from yesterday night.

“Hello? Anyone at HQ? Or anywhere? Please…” I put the radio down. I left the living room and looked through the window in my room, and then in the laundry room. Aspen as far as the eye can see. I wondered if this is what portions of the landscape used to look like, once upon a time. The bunkhouse had windows in the living room, the laundry room, and in each bedroom. But, I only had access to my own bedroom, all the others were locked up. Only one more place to look. The front door doesn’t have a window, so I cautiously cracked it open to see outside, winter air pouring in and stinging my eyes. Directly in front of me was a gruesome sight. A pile of red, white, and brown mush was about 5 feet in front of the door. I knew immediately it wasn’t an elk, because I could see half of the Fish and Wildlife Service emblem amid the tattered brown of the uniform. But there was still more to see. 

I looked up to find myself staring at a ghastly Christmas tree. The aspen’s skeletal hands clasped my jacket, beanie, keys, and iPad, extending them towards me as an offering. I wondered about the intelligence of this thing, and assume it means to tempt me with these items. Whereas the iPad and jacket are useless, I consider the value of the cell phone weighing down the left pocket of the jacket, and my keys. If I got my cell phone I could call someone, but that would require waiting at least 40 minutes for reinforcements if they left immediately. And certainly whoever arrived would be ill equipped to deal with this, it’d be a death sentence. Though perhaps I would be able to escape in the chaos? I sigh and look at my keys dangling in front of the opening in the mound. The front door leads out to the parking lot and the keys to my personal vehicle are on that keyring. The mound of trees is directly in front of me, but alone, and if I could get my keys I could sprint over to my car and maybe just get away.

I’ve decided that I will wait till night to escape. Maybe the mound can’t see as well in the dark? Maybe it sleeps at night? All I know for sure is that they're active during the day. So I’ll wait for it to get dark. If nothing changes by then, my only chance is to get those keys. I’ll let my eyes adjust, and then I’ll silently pull them off the branch and get to my car. I’ll take the back road out of the refuge and make it into town and just keep on driving. 

While I was writing I heard short screams far off towards the trails. It seems a few people must have gone hiking. All the more reason to take the back road, hopefully these things won’t have any reason to be there. Outside I can still only see a forest of barren white trees staring at me, waiting. I've also been hearing lots of birdsong, much more than usual, especially for this time of year, and the sound of woodpeckers. The birds really love the aspen it seems, and listening to the sound of a happy forest almost makes me smile in spite of it all.
