I knew my sister was home when I walked in the front door and heard the TV roaring mindless reality dialogue in the living room. I recognized the voices so I walked down the hallway towards the sound. 

“Rachel!” I yelled. “Turn it down - god damn!” 

No response. 

This was pretty typical behavior from Rachel who had basically detached from reality ever since she turned 16 and became obsessed with getting picked to be on “Love Lagoon” - her favorite show. She refused to even think about dating anyone in real life because she was saving herself for her love at The Lagoon.

As I entered the kitchen attached to the living room, I saw that nobody was watching these TV. The living area and kitchen were completely empty. 

I assumed she must be taking a shower or using the bathroom so I turned the volume down on the TV and headed toward the fridge. As I reached for the handle I noticed the note on the fridge.

“Son - Please leave your sister and her friend alone tonight. There are tacos in the fridge. We will be back in the morning. Love, mom + dad”

I thought it was a little odd that they left a note when they had sent me a text earlier saying I would have to figure out dinner for myself. When I opened the fridge I heard a thud from my sisters bedroom above. 

“Rachel!” I shouted again. This time I got a response but it wasn’t from my sister. 

“She’s fine - she’s just into the show!” Someone said in a high pitched voice.

I looked back to see the fridge was as cleared out as it was when I left for school in the morning. There were no tacos in the fridge. I thought the girls must have eaten them so I made a bowl of cereal instead. 

As I grabbed the remote to change the channel I saw something that paralyzed me momentarily. My sister was on the screen talking to a man on a swinging chair. The man was enormous. Bigger than any human I had ever seen. He had pale skin and eyes sunken into his head but my sister looked enthralled with him. When I regained my ability to move, I turned the volume up so I could hear what they were saying.

“You would really do that for me?” My sister asked the man with pleading eyes.

“The first chance I get.” he responded in a low demonic voice. 

They kissed and parted ways as they cut to another couple talking near the front door to the villa. When the girl spoke I felt my  skin tighten and my mouth get dry. It was the same voice that had called down the stairs to me a few minutes ago. Before I had any time to comprehend this, the man my sister had been talking to walked up and hugged the girl and fist pounded the guy. 

“The brother is home. He’s downstairs looking for tacos.” Said the girl.

The group laughed and the huge man walked towards the front door. As the show cut to commercial I heard the same loud thud above me that I heard earlier. This time it was much louder. Then there was a footstep. And another one. There was someone walking across my sisters bedroom.

“Rachel?” I croaked in a terrified attempt to wake up from this quickly unfurling nightmare.

No response but more footsteps. I heard my sisters bedroom door start to open. I turned back to the TV and screamed. Everyone was watching me. The whole cast was staring directly into the camera with dead expressions as if they were waiting for something to happen in my living room. 

The footsteps have started down the stairs and I’m worried it might be too late for me to run out. Please send help.
