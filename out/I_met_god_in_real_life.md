Around  august 5 in Texcoco, located in State of Mexico in Mexico at 10:30pm

What happened was:

In the entire sky all over it there were like 200 stars and they were still, more probably less than that than more. Then a tiny comet passed, normal until then; and just after that somewhat like ten seconds, all the stars started moving, geométrical forms, all of them to the south, none of them to other directions. And in the end the air that was calm the entire day started to blow a lot all across the bambus in my garden.

About the stars, **they moved slow as satellites, but some of them were fast as to arrange in geometrical forms like hexagons with the slow ones and the brighter ones in the center, others heading to the north were just also slow.

Then 10-15 minutes later the clouds closed the sky and it started a light rain.

Almost a third of the sky at the east was covered by a giant rain cloud up to the horizon, so maybe there there could have been other one hundred things

That thing was huge, It was like something in unity with the universe, but more simple the entire universe itself moving.

The video I filmed was bad quality so I only could film a star per video, and I can only upload one here. Theres no valid evidence hence.

It’s true, I think it was god for three main reasons:

Main reason is that that thing was endless. I live at the periphery of my city, so there aren’t high buildings, so what I could saw is that all the sky or all the stars started moving as a whole with at least individual speed patterns for each star all stretched to the horizon, it did looked like it’s own self. It wasn’t a face with angles or distances to measure.

Second thing is that in the entire day there was no strong wind, but when that happened, the air blew with such strenght that shook the bamboos, and as I think that extreme wind was a way of speaking in some way by the skies, not by simply a way of speaking from your body. And also I don’t want to say what I said or my thoughts at that moment, I objectively just comunicate what could be saw by all the people in there as a whole.

And the last one is that nine and a half years from this day backwards, in the same place I saw with three witnesses of the family of a ralative, fire footsteps with just the few floating ashes as body walking towards us at night at an unlit dirt road, those footsteps were just the border that a shoe leaves while walking but lit up with flames, it those steps dissapered right infront of me at cero meters distance when they entered in contact with my house lightning. We all thought that was some sort of demon at least. If something of the same sort happens in the same place maybe maybe it’s related.

I say that one was the Devil, but that’s another story.
