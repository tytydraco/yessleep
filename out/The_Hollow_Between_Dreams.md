Faces around—unknown, yet familiar. As if they were friends for decades, though one can’t recall a single name.
A scent lingers around her—of charcoal, seared meat and something faintly familiar. It clings to the skin, pressing into the senses, forcing one to accept it entirely.

She dials a number.

The screen glows dimly against her skin, the soft buzz of the ringing tone filling the silence between breaths.

While the backdrop is filled with quiet murmur of voices. Glasses clinking. The kind of afternoon where time drifts, weightless—one of those moments that fades into the blur of memories.

A click. Someone answers.

She lifts the phone to her ear, expecting a voice she knows.

Instead—

A pause.

Then, a voice unfamiliar.

It says her name. Slow. Certain.

Before she can speak—before she can even process the unease curling in her chest—

The call ends.

But not before two final words slip through the speaker, cold and absolute:

“I won’t.”

The call ends.

She stares at the phone. The screen fades to black, swallowing the only proof that the conversation ever happened.

Around her, nothing changes.

People keep talking, laughing, eating—just existing.

The moment should slip away, dissolve into the background noise like everything else.

But then—

The scent shifts.



She’s in a car.
Curled up. Sideways.
Her body is folded into itself, knees drawn tight to her chest, one arm wedged awkwardly beneath her head like a pillow. The other is limp, fingertips barely brushing the door.
She isn’t sitting. She’s lying on her side.
Yet—the seat beneath her hums with motion. The steady, rhythmic glide of a car rolling forward.
The car is moving.
A cold pulse of confusion spreads through her chest. Her breath is shallow, uneven.
Something is wrong.
Her senses return in slow, sluggish waves, like waking up underwater.
Her spine slowly uncurling, she sits upright and her grip on the steering wheel tightens. As she nonchalantly continues to drive while looking at the unknown terrain.



She pans around—a Rocky Mountainside. Jagged cliffs. An endless drop. The car rolls forward, steady. The only thing audible is the sound of the air conditioning. 

Then—she looks to the window beside her.

Its a face. Familiar 

Only—it’s not right.

The skin is pulled too tight over the skull, stretched thin like plastic wrap over bone. It clings unnaturally.

The mouth—smeared against the glass, melting. The lips drag downward, as if gravity itself is pulling them into a distorted, unnatural grin. The flesh sags, pooling at the edges of its jaw, teeth barely visible beneath the sagging skin. Like wax left too close to a flame.

A hollow where an eye should be, staring right at me.

The angles don’t make sense.

Like a glitch in reality. Like something trying to be human—but failing.

Her eyes widened, pupils dilated, lungs filled with air to scream but before she could she
woke up.

She sat up in bed, chest rising and falling in rapid bursts.

A dream.

Just a dream.

Repeating, mindlessly, to pull herself out, to make sense of something that felt so real, vanish in a jolt.

She shakes it off.

Takes a deep breath. Laughs—a little forced, but enough to feel real. Just a weird dream. Nothing more.

She climbs out of bed, glancing at the clock. The numbers blur for a second before snapping into focus. She doesn’t think about it.

The routine will help. Ground her. She straightens the sheets, smoothing over the fabric, then heads to the kitchen to make breakfast.

Except—

The kitchen isn’t there.

She stops.

The air presses in. Like the house itself is holding its breath.

Not just the kitchen. An entire section of the house is gone.

There’s no torn walls, no exposed beams—just emptiness.

Only thing in its place was the mirror. 

A mirror.

Her breath catches in her throat.

The glass is too still. No warping, no imperfections—a reflection too perfect to be real.

She steps forward.

Slowly.

The air feels thicker as she approaches. The floor beneath her feet feels softer.

She stops inches from the glass.
Her reflection looks back.
Everything seems normal—until she pans down.

She could see her heels.

Not her feet—her heels.

As if she were standing backward.
Her breath hitched. Her hands trembled, but she forced her gaze up, following the impossible angles of her own body.

The back of her elbows.

Bent wrong. Jutting outward. A perfect mirror image of something that shouldn’t be visible.
Her reflection wasn’t facing her.
It was turned away.
But it was still looking straight at her.
The moment the realization struck, a sharp, icy sensation crawled up her spine.
The world lurched—

She woke up.

Again.

And again.

Fifteen times.

Twenty.

Each time, the nightmare unraveled in subtly different ways—shifting details, warped logic, a horror that pressed in from the edges but never fully took shape.
Each time, she would wake, gasping—only to realize, she was still dreaming.
Until the twentieth time.
And this time, it was different.
She wasn’t alone.
A figure loomed in the shadows, barely visible, a presence more than a shape.
It watched. It waited.
Then, in a voice that sank into her bones, hollow and absolute, it spoke:

“I won’t let you sleep.”
And just like that—

I wake up.
Not her.Me.

3:45 AM.

My chest rose and fell in slow, labored breaths. My body ached, every muscle heavy with exhaustion.

I remembered going to sleep at 3:15. Maybe 3:30.

I had to work overtime last night—hours dragging into hours and I have a history of not getting a good sleep for past 3-4 years.

By the time I got home, I was dead tired. The kind of tired where your body isn’t even yours anymore, where your limbs move on instinct, and your mind flickers in and out like a dying bulb.

I remember lying down.

I could barely keep my eyes open for three, maybe four seconds before everything went dark.

Then—I was somewhere else.

Working.

Talking to people. Doing… something. The kind of tasks that fill space but leave no memory. It must have gone on for two, maybe three hours.

Then—

Something changed.

A shift. A wrongness. A weight pressing in from the edges.

And then—that figure.that voice.

The same one as before. Cold. Absolute. Inescapable.

“You are still asleep.”

I woke up. Again.

My body screamed. Aching. Heavy. Begging me to stay down.

I forced my eyes open. The clock read 3:50.

Only five minutes had passed.

My limbs went limp. My muscles refused to move. I didn’t even have the strength to turn my head. Sleep wasn’t a choice—it was gravity, pulling me under.

I slipped away.

Darkness took me.

And then—

That voice.

“You are still asleep.”

I gasped awake, heart hammering, body soaked in exhaustion. Every cell in me wanted rest.

The clock glowed in the darkness.

3:53.

And then—I forced myself back to sleep.

That’s when the real nightmare began.

I started living.

Everyday scenarios. Mundane moments stretched across time—some lasting hours, some stretching into months.

The longer I believed I was awake, the longer they lasted.

Sometimes I’d go to work, meet friends, feel the slow passage of life as if everything was back to normal.

Until—

A whisper.

Not loud. Not sudden. Just a faint murmur from a passing stranger.

“I won’t let you sleep.”

And then—

A second voice. Calm. Inevitable.

“You are still asleep.”

The moment those words touched me, reality shattered.

I jolted awake—gasping, disoriented—only to realize I was still dreaming.

This kept happening.

Again. Again. Again.

I would occasionally wake for mere seconds, my real body aching, fatigued, screaming for rest. But exhaustion dragged me under before I could even think.


People like Christopher Nolan's Inception to a work of art. They go on about what a great and novel concept it is, without truly considering the horror of someone stuck layers within their own subconscious without hope of escaping. 

Atleast the deepest they went in the movie was 3 layers. Meanwhile, here I was. Four hundred deep."

FOUR HUNDRED LAYERS DEEP IN MY OWN MIND. STUCK.

At that level, the barriers between dream and reality start to break.

In one of the iterations, I vividly remember calling my friends.

I needed proof. Something my dream couldn’t fabricate.

I asked them to tell me a secret—something they had told me once, something real.

And they did.

A private memory. A buried detail. Something only they knew.

For a moment, relief flooded in.

This was real. It had to be.

But then—the flaw in my logic hit me like ice water.

My dreams know what I know.

Every secret. Every conversation. Everything.

The walls around me began to disintegrate.

The air crackled, splitting like shattered glass.

And then—

The voices.

The first—a whisper, scattered in the wind.

“I won’t let you sleep.”

The second—calm, unwavering.

“You are still asleep.”

And just like that—

I woke up.

⸻

This morning, I called my friends.

Told them about the dream.

They listened. They reassured me. They laughed.

And yet—

As I sit here now, replaying the memory in my head—

I still don’t know if I’m awake.

Because after 400 layers—

Reality doesn’t feel real anymore.

I cant dare to have a deep sleep.

Even as a prank if you walk by me and say it, you would probably laugh at me freaking out. But only if you look closely in my eyes would see the fear of the words

"You are still asleep"
