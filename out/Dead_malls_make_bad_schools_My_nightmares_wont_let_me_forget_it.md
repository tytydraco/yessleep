I followed Ernie, watching as he replaced the tile behind us. We crawled through a maze of wires and pipes, dimly lit by his tablet. The sound of the mob faded. Soon, blinking arcade machines replaced the noise. Ernie reached an intentionally placed brick and tapped it rhythmically against a red pipe.

After a moment, a tile in front of us lifted. Bright white light spilled through. A long-necked boy in sport goggles peered up at us. With the brick still in hand, I worried Ernie would ruin whack-a-mole for me forever, but instead, the boy spoke, his tone annoyed.

"You're late," he said flatly, pushing his goggles up to his forehead. "And you brought a rookie."

"He’s with me." Ernie shrugged from his crawlspace perch. "Reed, this is Zane. Zane, Reed. He’s new. Had the definition of a rough start."

"Looks like it," Zane muttered, eyes locking on the dirt and blood smudged on my sleeve.

He stepped aside to reveal a ladder descending into the room below. I hesitated, but climbed down behind Ernie, emerging into a repurposed stockroom lit by overhead grow lights and powered by a hacked-together tangle of cords and cables. Arcade machines roared behind the walls, their noise masking the work being done in this backroom.

“Is there no door to the arcade?” I asked meekly.

“There was.” hissed an annoyed older girl in a patched bomber jacket. She looked up, pausing her soldering to look me up and down. A ceiling fan rotated weakly above her, swaying just enough to keep the stench of burnt plastic moving.

"Who’s the kid?" she asked, turning back to resume her work.

"Name’s Reed," Ernie answered for me, dropping into a ratty office chair. "New Cola-Co recruit, and future Zone Ranger."

"Nice to meet you, Reed. I’m Bella,” she grunted as she tucked her stray blonde hairs behind her ear. “Don’t touch anything."

Zane tossed me a warm bottle of SnackVault water and flopped onto a beanbag chair.

"You look like you’ve got questions."

"I... she just... collapsed," I said, massaging my injured shoulder. "And no one was around to help."

"Even if there was someone to help, they wouldn’t," Bella said, wiping her hands. "Most of the facilitators here are doped to the gills, every now and then, one zeroes out."

"Zeroes out?" I asked.

"They rely on FutureFunds too. When their balance runs dry, they lose access to their housing unit, food, and clinic." She explained solemnly. "Happens more than they admit."

I took a shaky sip of the water.

"So, what is this place? This… Zone Rangers thing?"

Zane rolled his eyes.

"Not the Boy Scouts Ernie probably sold you on. We’re glorified maintenance. Janitors. Techies. We’re the only ones keeping the place from eating itself."

Ernie grinned. "The extra funds every week doesn’t hurt either."

I tried to smile but failed.

"I appreciate your help, a lot.” I stammered over my words, trying not to offend my saviors, “But why invite me to join this secret club? Why bring me here?"

"Isn’t it obvious?" Ernie chimed, "We need someone to cover Monday cleanup rotations."

"Give him a break, Ernie.” Zane snorted. “This club ain’t secret, they’ve got us in every LearningZone. Ernie was eager to have a fresh pair of ears to talk off, like Josh.”

Ernie’s smile faded, and he stared at Zane with a seriousness I didn’t think he was capable of.

“Josh, he… zeroed out last week,” Ernie said through gritted teeth, “and you have his job and tablet.”

I froze. The bottle in my hand suddenly felt too heavy.

"We tried topping him off," Bella said quietly, eyes fixed on the circuit board. "We pooled what we had left, but the system flagged him anyway."

"They said he was transferred to a 'Vocational Bridge Program,'" Zane added, miming air quotes. "No one’s ever come back from one of those."

"His camera feed cut the day after,” Ernie shifted uncomfortably, “then his name vanished from the network. Like he never existed."

"We don’t think he died or anything," Bella said quickly. "We think they offloaded him somewhere."

Zane shrugged.

"Probably some warehouse job on the other side of the county, all we’ve got are theories." Zane added. "None of them good."

I tried to steady my breathing.

"Why hasn’t anyone tried to expose it?"

Zane looked up at me with a hollow expression.

"Everything here has an e-sig tying it back to you. Everything you do here is recorded and stored. The second you step off property, your tablet’s wiped. They don’t connect to the outside world."

No one spoke for a while. The whir of the fan filled the silence.

Those first weeks unfolded not as days upon a calendar, but as uneven clicks some inhuman metronome measured. Every morning, I descended from my dormitory into the bowels of the reanimated mall. The air itself seemed charged with an unseen electricity, a static that clung to my skin.

Ernie, ever jovial, led me through halls of screens and kiosks, where children’s laughter was smothered by the drone of bright advertisements that buzzed like flies around a corpse. I clung to his presence, not out of affection alone, but out of the primal knowledge that solitude here would drive me insane.

The days passed in cruel rhythm; study pods where the boredom dripped like venom, coating every thought with the taste of commerce and obligation; work shifts beneath the phosphorescent glow of Cola-Co logos, where my own reflection in the vending glass seemed stretched, half-familiar, as though a more ravenous twin pressed against from within.

Nights were no reprieve. The Zone Rangers’ hidden chamber overstimulated me with its glow of lamps and soldering irons, where Bella’s sharp voice cut the stagnant air, and Zane’s sardonic murmurs described fates worse than expulsion. The three of them treated their labors as ordinary, yet I could not help but sense that each flickering bulb and patchwork wire was less a rebellion than a ritual warding off the mall’s collapse.

Sleep eluded me. When I did collapse on the cot they provided, my dreams brimmed with visions of the mall as it once was: an endless atrium where the mannequins moved, their jointed arms raised not in retail display but in supplication to lights above that pulsed like distant stars.

I would wake drenched, the echo of a carousel tune rattling through the ducts, though I knew the carousel had been dismantled years ago. No one else claimed to hear it, yet Ernie would sometimes glance at me with a sheepish dread, as if my terror had unlocked something his mind.

As my first weeks turned to months at Eastbrook’s LearningZone, each dream etched deeper into my marrow with the certainty that beneath the tiled floors and fluorescent hum, something vast called to me.

In my dreams, the carousel had slumbered through the mall’s death, and now, in place of horses, Ernie, Zane, Bella, and the rest of my classmates were saddled, gold rods pierced straight through their backs and into the floor of the carousel. Some even bounced up and down as the carousel spun.

By day, my sleepless nights exacted their toll, and the toll was steep. I nodded through lectures in the pods, my eyelids drooping like curtains closing upon a crumbling stage. My answers faltered, trembling out half-formed, and the tablet punished me with merciless chimes, buzzing with penalties until the red counter of my FutureFunds drained away like sand through an hourglass.

Each mistake was recorded in unblinking digits; each hesitation flagged as inefficiency. Facilitators, their eyes glazed by chemical sedation, marked my sluggishness with cold, mechanical disdain, their lips twitching with disapproval but never sympathy. The balance sank so low I could feel the maw of zero gaping before me, ready to strip me of even the meager comfort of meals.

At work, my decline became more pronounced. Cola-Co demanded precision, the syrupy levers requiring a steadiness I no longer possessed. My hands slipped, sticky rivulets soaking the counters. The neon lights seemed to pulse in mockery, casting jaundiced hues upon my trembling figure. The supervisor’s voice, flat and distorted through the comm, invoked Bella’s name as if summoning her to witness my disgrace.

“Correct him,” the voice ordered, and I shrank beneath its chill command.

Ernie tried to shield me, whispering warnings and jokes meant to steady my nerves, but even his laughter sounded muffled now, as though filtered through layers of grinding gears and dripping pipes. Each mistake bled more credits from me, every slip brought me nearer to the abyss where the tablet would blink crimson, the symbol of judgment, and the iron gates of sustenance would slam shut forever.

My reflection mocked me from the glass of the vending station. At first, I thought it was merely exhaustion: a face hollowed, mouth half-open, eyes sunken in shadow. But as I stared, I saw the faintest ripple, as if the figure beyond the pane shifted independently of me.

My reflection’s lips twitched in a grimace I had not made. Its posture seemed bent, its head lolling toward the unseen depths below the counter. And then, more dreadful still, I perceived, beyond the glass, behind the wraithlike image of myself, the carousel’s shadow; its skeletal spokes revolving.

The ghastly horses were gone, replaced by the silhouettes of children and adolescents, their bodies rising and falling on golden rods that pierced them through. They moved with dreadful obedience, puppets of some ancient merriment that had outlived its audience.

I staggered back, blinking, yet the vision clung to my sight like an afterimage of lightning.

“Jesus, are you alright, Reed?” Ernie asked. I tried to respond, but my words tangled in my throat, and I could only nod.

Even when I turned away, the rhythm of the carousel lingered in my skull, an unseen rotation pulling at my thoughts, threatening to grind my very will into dust.

It was then I understood that exhaustion was no mere weakness, but a design. The LearningZone had no need of sleep. Sleep fractured resolve, sleep birthed terror, and terror carved obedience. Every moment awake was another strand woven into the invisible web that tightened around me. Every slip, every lost Fund, every reflection that smiled when I did not, each was a step closer to some inevitable reckoning that waited beneath the tiled floors and fluorescent hum, hungering with infinite patience.

I was at Zone Ranger HQ when the announcement thundered across the atrium, each syllable vibrating against the taut plastic banners that sagged above our heads, shaking dust loose from forgotten corners:

**“Reed McIntosh. Report to the Principal’s Office immediately.”**

The words clung to the walls like mildew, echoing through the empty service ducts until even the arcade machines seemed shushed into silence. Every neon bulb flickered in sympathy, stuttering in arrhythmic pulses. I felt the other Zone Rangers stiffen around me, their postures sharpened like blades sensing blood.

Bella set her soldering iron down with unusual care, its tip still glowing as if reluctant to extinguish itself. Ernie’s grin, so constant it had seemed soldered to his face, faltered into a twitch of fear. Zane’s goggles reflected my pale face like a warped mirror.

“No one comes back from that,” Bella muttered, her voice brittle as glass. Each word snapped in the air as if she feared being overheard by something far beyond walls and vents.

Zane gestured toward the vent with a stiff hand. Ernie leaned closer, whispering so softly I almost mistook his voice for the drone of a dying lightbulb.

“You don’t have to go. We can hide you. People vanish when they answer that call.” His hand trembled on my shoulder, and for the first time I sensed his bravado was nothing more than armor, thin and dented.

But the announcement boomed again, my name, each letter distorted, dragged across the atrium as though chewed by something enormous and unseen. The sound was not merely heard but felt, a summons that permitted no refusal. The air ducts above us groaned, as if the very building yearned for my compliance.

“If you ignore it, they’ll send escorts,” Bella rose, crossing her arms to mask the unease etched on her face, “and you don’t want to see what kind of things walk with badges in this place.”

Her warning coiled inside me, feeding the dread already growing in my gut. I thought of the carousel from my dreams, its golden rods piercing the bodies of classmates, the endless rotation. Perhaps this was simply the next step: a ride that demanded I mount.

The Zone Rangers surrounded me, their expressions a broken constellation of fear, pity, and resignation. They had seen this before. They knew the shape of my path, though none dared to describe it aloud.

Ernie’s lips parted as if to speak further, but the third announcement erupted, shaking the ceiling tiles loose so fine dust rained upon us like pale ash.

**“Reed McIntosh. Principal’s Office. Now.”**

The mall’s silence after the echo faded was unbearable, as if the building leaned closer, waiting.

I wanted to run, but my legs betrayed me. The carousel song was playing again, faint but unmistakable, winding through the ducts. Each note seemed to tug me forward, pulling me toward the Principal’s Office like I was already mounted on its endless ride.
