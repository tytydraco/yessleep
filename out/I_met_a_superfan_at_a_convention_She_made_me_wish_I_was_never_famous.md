I never thought that being famous would suck. I’m sure that saying that instantly makes me sound like some stuck-up dick, but I’m not saying it to make myself sound like more of a victim than I am. Being famous is just busy sometimes. Ever since I was cast in those back-to-back box office hits, every day has been full of phone calls and business meetings. Sometimes, I just want a couple minutes of peace and quiet.

What I thought was the good part about it, though, is having a fanbase. The fact that millions of people know who I am and have seen me perform was equally daunting and amazing at first. When I got the chance to meet a fan, it was always the highlight of my day - I tried to make it the highlight of theirs, too.

That bliss ended quickly. Having fans got progressively more uncomfortable. There are social media pages dedicated to me and my whereabouts. There’s groups that track my car, what projects I’m gonna be in - hell, there’s even one dedicated to fanfiction of the characters I portrayed. It’s all really weird, to be honest. I know it comes with the territory, and none of them were threatening me, at least - until I met Ashley.

It was a month ago. I was in a small coffee shop just outside of Brookfield, stopping in on my way to a convention. It was the third one I’d been to, and the largest - over 5000 attendees. We had a booth set up, promoting a new streaming series that I’d be playing a major role in. I liked my co-stars, and was excited to meet fans and answer questions, but desperately needed caffeine to keep me going, so I just ordered a large cup of coffee. A couple of people recognized me, and politely asked for pictures and autographs. They asked nicely, so I gave them what they wanted - people with manners are such a rarity.

It was on my way out that I saw her in the parking lot. She was in full cosplay - that in and of itself wasn’t unusual, especially considering that we were rather close to the convention center. What did strike me was who she was cosplaying. It was one of my characters - Andrew Marsh, from the *Icestalker* series. I was always excited to see someone dressed as one of my characters - it’s one of the many ways I know I did a good job. She saw me right after I saw her, and it looked like she was about to faint. I offered her a wave and kept walking to my rideshare, but she was already fast approaching. I didn’t want to ignore her and speed away, but I also really didn’t wanna run late, so I planned to just say hi and then tell her to come to our booth to chat.

“Hi!!!”

I smiled. She was clearly very excited, as I’d thought.

“Hi there.”

“You’re Adam Phorson!!! I’m such a big fan!!”

“Yep, that’s me! Thank you for being a fan! Always nice to meet people.”

“I have so many questions to ask you, oh my god. Do you have a minute?”

“Unfortunately, I’m kinda in a hurry. I think we’re both on the way to the same convention, and I can’t be late! If you stop by the *Dreamkiller* booth, I’ll skip you to the front of the line and answer all of your questions, okay?”

Her face dropped a little, but she maintained a smile and nodded eagerly.

“I’ll see you there!!!”

I waved goodbye as I got into the car. Nice girl, I thought to myself. I planned on keeping true to my promise, although part of me hoped she wouldn’t take advantage of what I thought was a good deed. I just hoped that she kept her questions short and kept the line moving.

She showed up fifteen minutes after we set the booth up. I’m not sure how she got there that fast, as there was a massive line outside the convention center, but I didn’t really think much of it at the time. I kept my promise and let her skip the line, signing her notebook and answering all of her questions. The first few were innocent - questions about the dog I posted on social media with, my wife and newborn son, upcoming projects that I’d love to be a part of, stuff like that. With how thorough her questions were, I thought she was some sort of guerilla reporter that had a secret camera on her. That thought faded, though, when the questions got weirdly personal. The first was about what hotel I was staying at, to which I stupidly told the truth. She then asked what floor I was on - to which I furrowed my brow and started lying.

“Oh, uhm…. I’m on the fifteenth floor, I think? I just kind of dropped my wife and kids off there and left without paying much mind.”

“Well, if it helps, you’re actually on the seventh floor!”

She was right. How did she know that, though? The part about me only being at the hotel for a little while was true - did people see me and report my location at that time? My confusion turned to fear, which quickly bubbled over into anger. I wanted to keep my composure in public, though, so I had my costar sit in for me and excused myself under the guise of going to the restroom. I went to the management office and immediately requested that she be removed from the convention, recounting what had happened. I gave them her badge number upon request, but it didn’t exist in the system. Maybe she just skipped the line and jumped in without paying, which would explain how quickly she got there.

When I got back to the booth, security hadn’t arrived yet, and she was still eagerly waiting there. I didn’t know if I could be nice for much longer - I don’t like to be even a little bit mean to people, but when they put me and my family in danger, that’s a different story. I sighed as I approached and sat back down in my folding chair.

“Yay, you’re back!!! Anyways, I heard that your wife is a nurse. Why would you marry someone in such a stuck up profession instead of someone who actually cares about what you do?”

I couldn’t believe what I’d just heard. She said it so quickly and fluidly that I looked up to check whether she was reading that question off of a script. She wasn’t, though - she was just looking at me, her smile gone and her expression completely flat. My co-stars turned their heads slightly upon hearing her - I think they were just as confused as I was. They weren’t nearly as angry as I was, though. I’d had enough - but I couldn’t just kick her out without figuring out who she was. I needed a name, or something, so that I could do my own little investigation and figure out if she was some stalker, or just that socially inept.

“Uh, I’m not sure, I guess? Love is love, and it works in funny ways. What did you say your name was?”

She stuck out her hand, expecting me to shake it.

“My name is Ashley Parker. Well, it’s the name I use on social media, anyway!”

I made a mental note of that name, planning to look it up later. For now, though, I was done here - with her and with the booth, at least for a few hours.”

“Right. Well, Ashley, the questions you asked were extremely inappropriate, and quite frankly, I think you need to find some sort of hobby outside of the entertainment space. Please exit the booth.”

I didn’t wait to see her reaction, but I could practically hear her turning red with the silence that permeated through the air after I said that. Everyone who was previously talking in the booth went completely silent, sans a few whispers. I walked back towards one of the breakrooms, sending a text to my co-stars, telling them that I’d be back once she’d left. I’m lucky to work with such awesome people - they were very understanding.

While I was sitting in the breakroom, I decided to google her name, and sure enough, I found a social media account linked to it. It looked like she was a nerd streamer, who primarily focused on TV shows and movies. TV shows and movies that I was conveniently a part of. The account didn’t have that many followers, and it was only created a few months after the first movie I was in. In the bio, I found a PDF full of links to all of her socials. It was the usual stuff - her sponsors, her streaming channels, and other more niche socials. In the middle of the list was a link to a forum about *Icestalker*, which I didn’t know existed. 

The website itself looked like it was made in a day - the interface was archaic, just a black screen with a bunch of hyperlinks and a chat box. The chat was fairly active - it wasn’t full of discussion regarding the show, though. It was all messages about my whereabouts, and the whereabouts of my coworkers. Among the sea of creepiness, one person’s messages stood out - it had to be her. I mean, the username was literally a\_parker\_phorson. My name, and hers, stitched together. “What the fuck” was the chief thought in my head at that moment.

Every message she had sent was absolutely vile. Most was her roleplaying with another person - her as herself, them as me. It started with sexual shit - until it got darker. They started roleplaying a situation where she would break into my house, tie me up, and “gut his wife like a fish”. That was only the start, though - it got worse, to the point that I was scrolling through the messages with exasperated breaths. This person was very obviously sick in the head, and I couldn’t bear to stay at the convention any longer.

I ran out to the booth to inform the other actors of what I’d found. After all, I didn’t know if there was some roleplay about them hidden in other crevices of the site. To their credit, they took it really seriously, to the point that we spent the afternoon shooing other fans away and packing up the booth. We had to cancel it, for our own safety. While they finished packing, I went over to the security office and inquired about what had happened to Ashley after I left. Apparently, she’d seen them coming, and left in a hurry. When I asked if they had any other information on her, they just shook their heads. It wasn’t their fault, of course, but that was obviously not what I was hoping to hear.

I hailed a cab outside the convention center after turning down a ride from my manager. Him and the rest of the crew were going to go into the city to get pizza, and I wasn’t really hungry after the day I’d had. Thankfully, the cabbie didn’t recognize me - I was about done with fans for the month. It was a long ride back to the hotel - about an hour and ten minutes. I don’t know why my manager booked us so far away, but he said it was the best he could find at the last minute, so I didn’t make a fuss about it. After about twenty minutes, I got the feeling that something was wrong. The little tingle in my gut told me to check the website again. My common sense told me to just not think about it anymore for the day, but after another ten minutes, the feeling got too overpowering. I opened the home page on my phone, and in the chat box, there were about two dozen new messages, all from the a\_parker\_phorson user. They were all in caps, and got increasingly more deranged. It began with her saying how embarrassed she had felt when “she got rejected”, then spiraled into what I can only describe as thinly veiled threats.

“I’M GONNA FUCKING LOSE IT.”

“HE’D BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HIS FAMILY. IT LOOKS LIKE HE CARES ABOUT THEM MORE THAN HIS FANS.”

The last message was sent two minutes ago, and it was the only one that wasn’t in caps.

“Members, check the Sightings page.”

The page she was talking about was in the sidebar. I hadn’t opened anything else on the site before, as I was too focused on the chat box. I opened it, and saw dozens of pictures. My phone started to lag near the bottom of the page, so I’m sure there were hundreds. All of them were candid shots, sorted by most recent date. All of them were of me. Me visiting my family just across state lines. Me outside of my house. More recently, me in the hotel hallway, with my wife and kid. My vision grew spotty, and my heart rate increased. All of them were uploaded by the a\_parker\_phorson account. The most recent picture posted to the site was of me, two minutes ago, at a red light. It was taken through the windshield, probably from a car in front of us.

I immediately asked the driver to wait outside the hotel while I grabbed my family and everything we’d brought. I offered him several thousand to do it, so it’s not like I was wasting his time. I was planning on having him drop us off at the local police station, where we could report the site and hopefully get this person tracked and arrested. I hadn’t called my wife up to that point - stupid, I know, but I didn’t want her to worry about me. She was already stressed and sleep deprived as is. I called her over, and over, and over again. She didn’t pick up. We were only two minutes away, but I couldn’t wait anymore. I offered him more money to run every red, and I think he only agreed to it since there was no one else on the road at that hour.

I sprinted through the lobby like a madman. I’m sure someone recognized me, and I’d be on some gossip site for it, but I really couldn’t have given less of a shit. I got into the elevator, and clicked the 7th floor button around a hundred times. Every second I spent in that elevator felt like a thousand years. I finally got to our floor, and rushed down the hall. I felt like my heart was going to explode.

I fumbled with my wallet until I found the keycard. I held it up to the lock, and the door clicked open. It was dark in the room. I called my wife’s name, expecting her to be asleep. It was around 11 at night, so she’d usually have our son in bed and be passed out herself. I flicked the lamp on - and stopped.

Our luggage was strewn out across the room. Clothes were scattered everywhere, and every zipper was open. My wife and son weren’t there. I checked the closet, hoping they were hiding. I checked the bathroom, hoping they were in there. I didn’t find them. What I did find, though, was a message, written in red on the mirror. It wasn’t words. It was just numbers.

I stood there, processing everything. I just looked at myself in the mirror for a bit. I snapped out of it, though, when I noticed the shower curtain was ajar. Someone was behind it, staring at me. 

I didn’t have time to react. I wish that I did - I would’ve killed her. Instead she jumped out and sprinted towards the door. I recognized the cosplay. I tried trailing her, but it didn’t matter. She was smaller and faster than me.

I immediately drove to the town’s police department, and reported everything. They promised me that they would immediately launch their investigation, and told me that there was nothing more I could do. I was told that I was a victim of circumstance - it wasn’t my fault that they’d gone missing. Some consolation that was.

I returned home two days later, without my family. I didn’t want to leave, but the police said it would help their investigation if I didn’t interfere. It was bullshit - no one was doing anything. They were just sitting and chatting all day while my wife and son were lost. The house felt lonelier than it had ever felt before. The only light that remained within me was the sliver of hope I felt. I hoped that my family was okay. I hoped that she didn’t actually hurt them. They didn’t deserve it. I wondered if me being rude to her was the thing that pushed her over the edge. Whether I wanted to know that for a fact was another story - I don’t think I could live with myself if I was the last straw.

My questions were answered the next day. I got a call from the chief of police, and immediately drove back to Brookfield. Based on his tone of voice, I knew something bad had happened - I just hoped it wasn’t death. When I got to the station, two officers whisked me into an interrogation room. I wasn’t actually being questioned, though - they just wanted to talk to me privately, and I guess they didn’t have another room.

The chief joined us shortly, but there were no formalities or greetings. The writing on the bathroom mirror wasn’t blood, it was lipstick - my wife’s. The numbers were coordinates that led the police to a small clearing in the woods just outside of town. They found a rotting skinned body, lying in the middle of a farmer’s field. It was my beautiful wife. She had been dead since that day of the convention - since the morning, probably right after I left for coffee.

They couldn’t find anything on Ashley. She was like a ghost. No history, no family connections. There was no DNA evidence at the crime scene. Her socials had been wiped, and the website just displayed an entirely black screen. I had expected all that - someone that insane doesn’t get far in life without being thorough.

So that was that. My wife was dead, my son was missing, and they didn’t catch Ashley. That wasn’t even her name, of course, but it’ll always be the name of the person who ruined my life in a flash. I returned home, and immediately called out of every role I’d picked up. I was probably done acting for good, and if I wasn’t, I certainly needed a long break. Social media had already picked up on my story, so I’m sure some dickhead reporters were already salivating at the thought of filming a segment outside of my house. I’d had enough. That night, I think I almost drank myself to death - I wish I had.

Right now, I’m in a hotel room two states away, writing all of this because of what happened earlier tonight. I got the feeling in my gut again while I was making some shitty boxed mac n’ cheese. The same feeling that irked me to check the website. It was still a black screen - I didn’t expect it to be back up, so I was relieved. Before I closed the page, I noticed something. In the bottom right corner of the page, was extremely dark gray text. Honestly, I’m not sure how I noticed it, but I did. It just said “HERE”. How did the police not see this? Fearing that my gut feeling was right, I clicked on it.

It was the same fucking homepage, just with a new URL. Only one new chat had been sent - an identical copy of a previous one.

“Members, check the Sightings page.”

I clicked on the link to the sightings page.

There were three new pictures. The first was of Ashley, sitting next to my bound and gagged wife. The look in my wife’s eyes made me want to sob.

The second was of my wife’s body, in the field. Only Ashley’s eye was visible in the shot - in the corner of the frame.

The third picture had a caption. The third picture was the reason that I’m in this motel right now.

It was a dark room, with a table in the middle of it. The table had a nice silk tablecloth on it, with a breadbasket and the room’s only light source, a candle, in the middle. Sitting in the chair, at the opposite end of the table, was what looked like my wife. I knew better, though. It wasn’t her - it was just her skin, on someone else’s body. The caption read, “I’m finally as pretty as her!”

I didn’t have time to cry or freak out when I saw that. I shut the computer off, grabbed a backpack, shoved some clothes in it, and left. I drove until I was about to fall asleep behind the wheel, at which point I pulled into the motel parking lot.

I checked the page again five minutes ago. There was one new picture on the sightings page. She found my house - which I fled hours ago. She can't be far behind.
