I am currently writing this with what little time I have in this dimension, but I won't waste time anymore. I'll get to the point.  
  
My name is William. I am 34 years old, and as of last year, my life was completely normal with a wife and three children. Luckily, I made a journal of what has happened over the last five years. I'll start from the beginning.  
  
I woke up tired and rolled over to turn off my alarm. It was 6 AM sharp, time to get the kids ready for school. I woke up my wife, and she went downstairs to make breakfast for the kids. I went back to bed, trying to catch at least 5 minutes of sleep when...  
  
Wife: "Honey, we don't have any milk to make the kids' breakfast. Please, can you buy some?"  
  
I woke up and said, "Okay, I'll go out and buy some." I put on my clothes, still half asleep, then descended the stairs and walked to the door. I said, "Bye, honey." God, those were the last words I ever said to her. As I walked to the store, I felt a strange feeling of fear. I don't know why, but I did.  
  
When I arrived at the store, I couldn't find milk anywhere, no matter how hard I looked. Eventually, I asked the cashier, and she said, "I'm sorry, we ran out. But the local store may still have milk in stock." I thanked her and started to walk out of the store when I felt an intense feeling of fear. It stopped instantly when I walked out but quickly returned when I realized I was not in the same place. Somehow, I found myself in what seemed like a dry desert. That was the first thing I quickly noted down. I also had a backpack with food and water to last me up to a week, which was strange since I didn't remember leaving the house with a backpack. The only thing I could do now was walk, so I did.  
  
After about an hour of walking in the same direction, I found a small village. This village didn't seem modern at all; it seemed like something out of the first century BCE. Their houses were made out of hardened sand and rock, and not much more.  
  
Here's where it gets even stranger. I discovered that they spoke a language that sounded like a mix of Brazilian and Egyptian. Even stranger, whenever I tried to speak, the words would come out in their language, even though I didn't know how to speak it. And yet, I could understand them, despite never learning or even hearing the language before I came to this place. Anyways, they luckily seemed very friendly, offering me food and shelter. After staying for a week, I noticed that their diet mainly consisted of fish that they would catch from a river flowing through the village. Another thing I noticed was their water problem. The river that flowed through their village carried saltwater, and they had to walk up to 2 miles just to get fresh water from where the river split. So, I would go myself on the 2-mile journey every week to bring water to the village. The villagers commended me for this, but after some time, it became annoying. So, I devised a plan with some of the villagers, 16 of them to be exact...  
  
The plan was that we would dig a deep, thick line in the ground from where the river splits back to the village. At the village, we would dig a big round hole, not too deep but deep enough for the water to flow into, and we would be able to easily access it. The line in the ground would be covered with hardened sand to keep dust from getting into our water. The hole would also be covered with hardened sand, except for the part where the water would flow into. We would make something out of hardened sand to put over it and then lift it up when someone wanted water. This plan should take us about a month to complete, but as word spread around the village, more people joined, and we finished it in only a week. After that, everyone cheered and thanked me. The village partied all night, and I went to bed. But when I woke up, I was not in the same place.  
  
I woke up on a street in a city that looked like it was out of a sci-fi movie. I was confused that I didn't wake up in the village where I had spent the last two weeks. I asked a random man who was walking on the street about this place and where it was. He smiled and said, "Welcome to the Great Qing Dynasty." "Impossible," I said. "The Qing Dynasty fell over a hundred years ago." He looked at me like I was crazy and walked away. After that, I realized I had a wallet that contained at least 10 of the currency of this place. I was right, and I managed to find a hotel and booked it for one month. It cost me about 4,000 of whatever currency this is, out of the 10,000 I started with. Now, shelter wasn't a problem anymore. I found a local store, so food and shelter were no longer an issue. Again, they spoke a language that I didn't know, but somehow, I could speak and understand it. Universal translator at hand, I suppose. After some time, I noticed from watching the news that there was a serious crime problem here. I don't know why, but something compelled me to fix the issue. After about a year, I joined the law enforcement, and two years later, I was promoted to head of police. With my newfound power, I realized that most of the crimes being committed were by extremely poor people. So, armed with my new information, I approached the city council, and they were very understanding. Long story short, they made some changes, and almost all the crimes stopped. Shortly after that, I woke up in a new place.  
  
Okay, I think I finally understand what's going on. I randomly get teleported to a place and have to fix whatever problem is there, and then get teleported to a new place. I also seem to always start off with items to help me out. Well, this time was a bit different.  
  
I awoke on the floor along with three other people. It looked like I was the last to wake up. The three others explained to me that they were just like me, endlessly being teleported to different realities. They gave me their names: Don, Hana, and Jake. Don reasoned that we must have been paired together because there would be a big challenge ahead. Jake recommended that we check for anything that we might have started off with, and we did just that. We found food to last us at least two weeks. Hana devised a three-step plan:  
  
Step 1: Gather anything we might need.  
Step 2: Find out what's wrong.  
Step 3: Make a plan to fix it.  
  
It sounded quite simple, and we stuck to it. After four weeks of our combined efforts, we gathered a lot of food, water, and money. We all got stable jobs, but it took us an extra month to figure out what was wrong.  
  
Here's what we figured out so far: We are located in the USA, but it is run by a socialist government that is highly corrupt. So, it was clear that our mission was to fix that. But after some more digging, we found that the government split into six branches: economy, military, social, personal, corporate, and ideological. These branches were run by six people. So, it was clear what we had to do: hunt them down and kill them. I will organize a meeting with me, Don, Hana, and Jake tomorrow on how we will do this.  
  
Me: "As you all know, I have gathered all of you for the sole reason of completing our mission. I have come to the conclusion that we must kill the six rulers, but how?"  
  
Don: "I have an idea. I have gathered information on all of them and their whereabouts. The chief of economics, name unknown but goes under the alias of H, is currently unknown, but it is rumored that he will make an appearance in the following days. We can follow him back to his whereabouts and kill him. As for the rest, they are currently unknown. Too bad we don't have any weapons."  
  
Hana: "Actually, I have managed to get my hands on a gun."  
  
Jake: "How did you manage to do that?"  
  
Hana: "Long story, and not much time to explain."  
  
Me: "Well, we have a plan and the resources to do it. Tomorrow, we shall kill for the first time. Get some rest."  
  
And that was it. We all went to bed. I rose first, and shortly after I woke up, I woke everyone else up. It was time. We put on our clothes, got ready, and left. We attended the speech by the current head of economics. Strangely, he didn't have any bodyguards, and he wasn't armed at all. After he finished his speech, he got into what looked like a black SUV. We got into a car and followed. After about an hour of driving, the black SUV stopped at what looked like a house in the middle of nowhere. We got out of the car, and just as we were about to speak, he said, "I know you're here to kill me, and you won't." Hana did not waste time. She shot him in the head point-blank. He fell down, covered in blood, and then, to everyone's surprise, he got up and started to speak. His words put everyone in a trance-like state. He said, "Is that all? A shame. I can offer you things beyond your wildest dreams. Do not think I do not know who you are. I have killed many of your kind, my dimension hoppers. We don't need to fight. Your powers can help me, and I can help you. So, what do you say? My offer is if you let me experiment on you and extract your powers, I will let you live a peaceful life here. What do you say? Else, I kill you."  
  
Before I could reply, Hana turned and shot Don in the arm. Out of instinct, I rushed to pull the gun off Hana. I looked at her, and her eyes were pitch black. I turned and emptied the gun into the man who seemed to be controlling Hana. One thing I noted was that every time I shot him, he would become about a foot smaller but wouldn't die. He started off 6 feet tall, and now he was only 2 feet tall. Another thing that I noticed was that his mind control would grow even stronger despite him getting smaller. At first, he was only able to control Hana, but now he was able to control both Hana and Don at the same time. I noticed that when Hana and Don both rushed towards me, throwing punches and kicks, I knew I had to kill the mind controller at least two more times. I had a knife in a pocket that I don't even remember bringing, and I stabbed him in the chest. He got 1 foot shorter. I pulled it out and aimed for the neck, and then it all went blank.  
  
I woke up, and Hana and Don were beside me. We had won. The mind controller was dead. One down, four more to go. We would go back to the house where we would meet Jake, who was too scared to go with us, and plan our next move.  
  
Hey, everyone, this is my first story that I have ever written here. I love reading creepypasta, so I thought I might as well write one. Please give me feedback on how I can improve my storytelling. Also, provide a rating from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best and 1 being the worst. Again, I really want feedback. I will make a follow-up to this.
