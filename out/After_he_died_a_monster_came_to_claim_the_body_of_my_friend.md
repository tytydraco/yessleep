Old tombstones stabbed up through the swirling mist like jagged, crooked knives. They skewed drunkenly, leaning one way or the other as we staggered past in quiet desperation. Grass and weeds had grown up around the plots of the old graves, and if there ever had been an obvious path, it was long gone. I fancied I was lost in a netherworld of unending tombs.

That was probably the concussion speaking. The world spun madly with my every step, and I felt sick to my stomach. My legs shook so badly that I lurched from gravestone to gravestone like a storm-tossed boat between islands. The old stones supported me when my legs gave out, and I had to stand for several minutes just to collect myself and keep going.

Alex wasn’t much better. His face was taciturn, determined. But the skin was pale, and my eyes were drawn again to the jagged, gaping wound in his shoulder, where the metal of the car had run him through during the crash. His shirt was stained red and it trickled down his chest and dripped from his belt. The pathetic bandage I’d drunkenly applied seemed powerless to stem the flood.

“We just need to keep going,” the words were as slippery in my mouth as the path was beneath my feet. In the distance, I saw mausoleums rise like broken, yellowed teeth. They were carpeted with vines and hanging creepers which waved in the breeze like a morbid shroud.

“Saved some time, anyway,” Alex’s voice sounded faint. He looked faint too. Like he was shrinking into himself second by second. “When they find us here, they can just toss us into a hole.”

“We’re not going to die,” I said. “We’re going to get out of this. We’ll find help and-”

“Find help?” His laughter came out more as a desperate, wet splutter. “Where, Mike? We’re in a graveyard, miles from anywhere. There’s no help to find.”

“There’s gotta be a gravekeeper!”

“Think so? Look at this place. No one’s been here for a hundred damn years.”

He stumbled and went down to one knee, a look of pain flashed across his pallid face. His hand shot out and he steadied himself on a nearby gravestone.

“Much obliged, Martha. Hope you don’t mind blood on your plot. Guess you might appreciate the company.” He sagged against the gravestone with a grim sense of finality, and I sank to my knees as well. The nausea  pounded sickeningly behind my temples and I heaved and threw up, my body convulsing until there was nothing left to eject.

"Alex?"

"Yeah?"

"I feel cold."

"Fuck, man. I don't feel anything at all."

In retrospect, those were some pretty shitty last words, but I don't think he put much thought into it. I know I didn’t. Not until I turned my head towards him, at least. Not until I realised how horribly, utterly still he’d suddenly become.

“Alex? Alex! Get up! Get the fuck up! Come on, man! Fuck, fuck, fuck, I’ve known you for years! Don’t fucking die on me just like that!”

But he was gone, and soon, I would be too. The knowledge washed over me like an icy surge deep in my gut. I was going to die here. I was going to die here in this graveyard, far away from anyone and anything I knew. All because of some stupid car accident. Would any of my friends ever even know what had happened?

By now, it was getting dark. The sun hung heavy above the horizon, and crimson fingers spread through the hazy grey clouds like stains across a satin sheet. My head was stuffed with cotton. Thoughts were slower now, and things that should have made sense were confusing. I wondered - during one of my lucid periods - if I was bleeding inside my brain. Just waiting for my skull to pop.

Alex's corpse grew cold, and the last of my strength faded drop by drop. There was no pain now. My thoughts had become a faltering crawl, and the world narrowed around me. Gradually closing in like a ring of spears.

Thump.

A sound broke my trance. Distant, but heavy. Present. Real. My eyes snapped open, and my body stirred back to life. For an instant, I panicked. Had I imagined it? Hallucinated rescue?

It came again. Closer, and off to the right. I strained to see through the thick cloak of mist which seemed to have draped itself across the world.

Thump.

Thump.

Thump.

Was someone walking? It was an odd sound, and as it got closer, I started to make out a second, slithering component. Like something was being dragged behind it.

Thump, slither.

Thump, slither.

Whatever it was, it sounded heavy, and my feverish imagination conjured half-mad images of bears stalking the silent graves.

“Help!” I managed after far too long. Speaking was hard. Even simple words felt slippery and foreign. “Please help, I don’t want to die.”

The sound stopped. There came a heart-rending moment of silence, and then it moved closer.

Thump, slither.

Thump, slither.

Something was coming now. The outline loomed like an iceberg in the mist. I blinked, tried to clear my vision. The world seemed to consist of unnatural angles, and my body felt heavy and sick.

“Are you going to answer me?” I choked out more words. It was harder to speak now. My tongue rebelled against me. “ Please answer! Let me know you’re human.”

It didn’t answer and as it loomed closer, I felt with a horrible, sinking certainty that it was definitely not human. It was big; almost twice as tall as I was. Its left leg was the hoofed limb of a stag, covered in downy, brown fur which rose up to its ankle. There, it was abruptly cut off and replaced by the misshapen thigh of a grizzly bear. A ring of sinewy stitches marked the point of connection, and a thick, fetid smell dragged behind it like a cloak.

The other leg was the source of the dragging sound. It was a mishmash of malformed goat-limbs all fused into one pulsing mass. It twitched and throbbed, streams of pus and rot wept from its exposed, pink muscle and tendon. The torso to which the limbs were joined was impossible to pinpoint. Perhaps an ape of some sort? Certainly, if it were human, it was now too bloated and gaseous to ever say for sure.

The limbs, though. Those were human. I felt a dawning sense of horror clawing its way up my spine. Human, but not the same human. One was the muscular and thick arm of a man while the other was slender and tapering. A woman’s arm. As for the head? That was a dog. A collie, I thought, though even now, I’m not totally sure. It was mouldering, the centrepiece to a crown of flies which perched and flew and buzzed about it. Its pale, sightless eyes were dead and rotting in their sockets.

In that instant, I was sure I’d gone mad. A monster from some twisted story loomed through the mist at me, and all I could think was ‘’Something like this can’t really exist. I must be imagining it.’’

It was as though my brain was trying to refuse it. Monsters just weren’t a thing. I didn’t feel terror, but rather, an icy unreality. Like I was in the grip of a dream and I’d wake up at any moment.

The creature was rot. The air crawled fat and heavy with the wing beats of flies. The scent rolled across me like a solid thing. Like a slap to the face. It curled in my nose, and curdled in my thoughts. I heaved, and if I hadn’t already vomited everything up, I’d have done it then and there. Closer now, it came. Inching closer. The dog’s head turned. Its nose twitched. I didn’t know how it could smell anything at all beyond the overwhelming power of its own physical corruption, but it did. It turned towards us.

Towards Alex.

Now came the terror. My fantasy of a nightmare shattered on the iron reef of reality. This was no dream. This was a true and real monster. Fear lent me new strength, and I managed to crawl a little bit, making distance between myself and Alex before my body gave out and I sprawled once more to the earth.

The monster ignored me. It heaved its twisted, spasming limb across the ground and came at last to the site of Alex’s death. There, it knelt with pained wheeze. Even on its knees, it towered above him. A hand closed about Alex’s arm and it lifted him into the air with an inhuman strength. The sight of him there, dangling lifelessly like a doll will stay with me until my dying day. His head slumped down, his limbs were limp. Part of me kept waiting for it to end. For him to spring back, to tell me all of this was just some bad joke. Some prank.

But it was no prank, and I was in a nightmare. As I watched, this horrific creature - this twisted abomination of a thing - reached out and casually tore a limb off my best friend. It was his leg. The creature's fingers dove into the flesh, and it seemed to simply yield to it. There was no struggle. There was no tearing. Just a clean break as meat and bone parted company with the greater whole.

Next, the monster reached down and wrapped its free hand about the weeping amalgamation that was its goat leg. With a grunt and a sharp pull, the thing came free. There was a horrific stench, and a cloud of stinking gas spewed forth from the wetness of the new wound. It pressed Alex’s leg into the stump, and the stitches came to live. They twisted like eels, like snakes, like the tongues of devils as they wove themselves into his flesh and in a single instant, they drew tight. The creature flexed his leg as though it were its own and rose again with considerably more ease and grace.

That was when it found me. I felt the weight of its gaze. Its eyes were sightless and blind, yet it saw me still. Its focus was an icy lance driven through my gut. A cold blade plunged between my ribs. A subtle shifting of priorities I hadn’t even known it had.

Alex’s leg carried it swiftly towards where I lay. I gave a sob of pure terror as its fingers closed around my wrist and just like my friend before, I was jerked into the air. My head throbbed and I convulsed and dry-heaved until I felt like I was going to die then and there.

It held me up. Its blank, canine eyes were furred with mold, Its fangs were yellow and cracked, and its lolling tongue was black and purple.

Oh god, it was looking at my head.

Oh fuck it was sizing me up!  Was it going to do to me what it had done with Alex? Was it going to wear my face? I couldn't scream, and I could barely beg. My mumbled words of terror and desperation flooded from my throat in a stream of pathetic pleas.

It didn't react to any of them. One hand held me up while the other - the woman's hand - pressed against my forehead. Its touch was cold and unnatural, it felt filthy against my soul and I wondered madly if the woman whose hand was about to end my life had once spent her final moments exactly like this.

The fingers moved upward, probing at my scalp. They tugged my hair aside with an awful gentleness, and brushed the bare skin of my skull. Around the back of my head, the monster seemed to find what it was looking for. It put on more force, and it suddenly felt as though it were trying to crack my head in two.

Pain followed. Intense. Deep. Not cutting, but wet. As if its fingers were working their way inside me, passing through the bone of my skull like some kind of liquid, melding with my insides until they reached my brain.

It reached its destination with a burst of agony. Sharp, cold shards ripped into my mind. My thoughts became a jumbled kaleidoscope of nonsensical sensation. For a moment, I wasn't a man at all. Just a beast. An animal running on instinct with a knife carving through my very brain and filthy fingers scrapping against my thoughts.

An explosion went off inside my skull; the most vivid pain I'd ever known crackled through my body until every nerve and every sense was alight with fire.

Every part of me was screaming.

Darkness came swiftly after that. My limbs grew heavy, my scattered, broken thoughts grew silent. In honesty, if there was anything at all left of me by that point, it was just grateful that the pain was about to end.

They found me next morning. Someone on the road passed the wreck and called the police. The EMTs swarmed me like insects and I was dragged into an ambulance before I even knew I was still here.

They told me I was lucky to be alive. When I talked about the monster, they said it was probably my brain throwing up hallucinations after the shock of the impact. Scheduled me for a scan. What they found only convinced me it had been all too real.

I'd been haemorrhaging. A slow bleed over hours, but fatal without care. That was why my thoughts had slowed. I'd been fucking dying. The doctors told me it was down to the brain. Such an amazing organ. Must have routed around the damage as I slept. Fixed itself up. As for the bleed not killing? That was a miracle. I'd rolled a hundred dice and come up with a six on every one.

Even they didn’t seem to buy it, and me? I believed it even less. It was no miracle, and it certainly wasn’t my brain doing some nigh-impossible rewiring of itself overnight! The monster, that creature, that staggering, stinking, tottering corpse amalgamation had saved me. It reached into my damn brain and stopped the bleed. Took whatever damage had already been done and rolled it back.

But why?

Even now, I don't understand. Was it some sort of payment? Did it think I was offering Alex to it? They never found him, you know. Never found his body. Even the blood was gone when I came to. Was that the bargain? A body for salvation? Or… Did it do it just because it could? It already had him, so it didn't need me.

The question haunts me to this day, and so do thoughts of the creature. That monster that dwells amidst mist-wreathed tombs. I've been back there. In my dreams. I see it stomping between the old graves. Lingering in the shadows of the gothic mausoleums.

It has Alex's face now, and every night, in the dream, I see it in the mist.

And it sees me too.
