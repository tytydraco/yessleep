I’m so glad to finally be out of the cold. I can see the snow falling from the bedside window and it would almost be comforting if it weren’t for the constant whirring and beeping of all the medical equipment driving me insane. The doctor’s certainly think I am or at least that’s their explanation for what happened. They’re saying that the stress and hypothermia caused some sort of hallucination or psychotic break. Screw them, they didn’t see with their own two eyes what I did! I’m not insane. It’s not even the worst part.


“Right now it’s best to focus on your recovery, I’m sure they’ll have your friend home by Christmas .”


“Oh you poor thing, I can’t imagine how you must feel but you know the whole town is looking for your friend, she wouldn’t want you to worry.”


“Don’t worry Miss, it won't take long for us to find your friend, just sit tight.”


I wish they’d all just shut up! They don’t fucking understand. I saw her get snatched with my own two eyes but I guess that doesn’t matter to them. They’re all out there looking for her but they don’t know the first thing about her. I’m the only one who knows! I’m the only one who really cares! Her name was Malarie and she was more than just my friend.

I was sitting in the front row in class the day she strolled in. On what should’ve been an unassuming monday I found myself annoyed. Annoyed at the little girl blocking the doorway because she was too afraid to let go of her grandma’s hand. Annoyed at the amount of time the teacher took up trying to introduce her to the class before recess. Annoyed at how pathetic her sobbing was after my friend Vicky took her pretty red amulet. At first I found it a little funny but after the millionth time it too just became annoying so much so I couldn't ignore it anymore.


“Stop crying already!” All she did was look up at me and continued to wail harder. In hindsight that wasn’t the best move. Awkwardly I tried to make up for my sudden appearance by lending out my hand to hers.


“Sigh, hurry up and stop crying or else I’ll… um  just, just stop crying okay!”


Sniffle “Ok-okay.”


“Now come on, go get your necklace back.”


“It's an amulet…”


“I don’t care, just go get it back.” I practically had to drag her to where Vicky was on the swings. The whole way she cowered behind me clenching my hand so hard I thought she was going to break it.


“Kate, why'd you bring this loooser over here?”


“She has something to say to you.” I nudged Malarie forward and at first I thought she was about to cry again but then she spoke.


“Th-that amulet doesn’t belong to you , it's my grandmothers so give it back! Pl-please…” For however cute she was Vicky paid no mind as she flashed her amulet in her face.


“You want it back, go on and take it from me then weirdo!” As she stood there trembling Vicky wasted no time in laughing and pushing her to the ground. It was pathetic.


“Ugh really!” In quick motion I pushed Vicky back and as she fell I grabbed her amulet. 


“Kate what the heck! I’m telling the teacher! Mrs. Springfield!”


“Th-thank you…”


“Don’t thank me, you should’ve done it yourself.” Seeing the tears start to form again I didn’t really know what else to say.


“Wah don’t cry! We're in the 5th grade, crying’s for babies! Look, my name's Katelyn, what's yours?”


“Malarie.” Suddenly she wrapped her arms around me tight.


“Wha- what are you doing!?” We stood there for a moment, not wanting to hear her cry again. I ended up awkwardly hugging her back.


“Gosh if you’re gonna be so weak everyone’s gonna pick on you, I can only help you so much.”


“Sorry.”


She clung to me like the plague and ended up following me around a lot. It didn’t help that we lived so close to each other. At first it was annoying but eventually I actually started to enjoy her company, for a while actually we hung out a lot so after a shitty day she was my go to.


“This shit is so fucking stupid!! How do people not understand the only reason he’s saying all this shit is because I stood his bitch ass up!”


“Look, just take a deep breath, it’s already winter break so everyone’s going to forget besides who cares what they actually think.”


“It’s not just that, I thought we were cool but he just had to go and ruin it. I never even wanted to agree on a date in the first place but he brought all his stupid ass friends and it was so embarrassing I just said yes without thinking! Ugh! This is why I hate men!” 


I was fully prepared to continue ranting and raving for another couple of hours before Malarie put her hand on mine. I almost pulled away but her hands were so soft and it reminded me of why I was really there.


“Shit, my bad Malarie I’m okay now I think.”


“It’s alright, we won’t have to see any of them for a while anyways besides we’ll be too busy on our own!”


“What does that mean?”


“Last summer you said you’d let me plan out our next little adventure after you dragged me around all summer, remember?”


“Ah shit I guess I did, well what did you think up for us to do anyways?”


“We’re going Camping!” As she kept up she excitedly pointed at the endless forested mountain range off in the distance. A pure white landscape only interrupted by the thick greenery of the pine trees. For as beautiful as it looked from afar nature’s a mean bitch and I really didn’t want to be in her way.


“But it’s going to be hella cold, no way I’m going up there!”


“Huh?, but you promised!”


“Well I guess I’m a liar then, sorry.”


“ Hmph, Fine but I’m going up there with or without you.”


“Awww seriously, can’t we just have like a super long sleepover? It's been ages since we’ve had one.” She looked away, most definitely pouting. I tried my best not to play her game because I always lose when we do but she’s just too good.


“Well I’m going regardless.”


“Sigh, I liked you better when you would just listen to me.”


“So is that a yes!”


“Finnneeee.”


“Yaay! Okay we’re going to need to prep well so make sure that you bring…”


Malarie took no time in celebration. With a quick hug and skip away she knew she’d won again. It was nice though, regrettably I haven’t been able to hang out with Malarie for a while and I could tell by how she kept rambling about things we’d need to pack that she missed having me around too.


“… I’ll be up to get you early in the morning so you better wake up for me!”


“Hey! You’re the one who’s been sleeping through all my phone calls dummy.”


She stopped in her tracks looking down before she spoke again.


“I know… sorry.”


“Hey it’s okay… I know you’ve been… sick a lot and I promise I don’t want to pry but your eyes, you haven’t been sleeping well have you?”


“I’ll be just fine.”


I knew her too well. As I hugged her she practically crushed me hugging back and as I brushed my fingers through her wavy brown hair she looked up at me.


“I promise I’ll be there this time no matter what, ‘Kay.”


“ ‘Kay.” With that she practically skipped all the way home with that stupid smile on her face.

—

The sun wasn’t even fully up yet when Malarie came calling. I really wish she had text but regardless I got changed for my ‘vacation’ up the mountains. The drive was a long one not that I was complaining, with the heater chasing away the cold and wrapped under a nice blanket I easily fell asleep as Malarie’s brisk pace made drives with her pretty enjoyable.


Screeeech  


I hit the back of my head on the headrest pretty hard so when I first saw it I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Looking out into the vast sea of snow I noticed something out of place. It filled my stomach with dread and my head seemed to fill with static. I only saw it for a moment before Malarie grabbed me by the shoulders and stared deep into my eyes. It was only later that I’d find out what exactly that thing was.


“Ugh… What happened.”


“I’m sorry! There was… a bunny rabbit passing by and I didn’t want to hit it!”


“Haha, seriously? I’m surprised you could even see it, don’t they turn white in the winter or something.”


“Oh yeah… sorry. Um you can go back to bed if you want. I’ll be more careful this time.”


“Nah we’re almost there anyways just don’t kill us, I hit my head so hard I was seeing spots in my vision.”


“… Kate?”


“Yeah?”


“Do you believe in ghosts?” It was an innocent enough question but Malarie asked with so much sincerity it made me giggle. 


“Hehe, no way. Did you watch a scary movie without me or something?”

“Nooo, ok maybe one, but that’s not why…. It’s just how you would react if you were to see one.”


“I donna know, probably run away or something but I wouldn’t hide behind my best friend's back that’s for sure.”


“Hey!, you’re just comfortable is all.” Malarie seemed to ease her grip on the steering wheel and as we peacefully strolled alone we eventually pulled up to Malarie’s spot. As Malarie stepped out of the car I coveted the last few seconds of warmth from the heater before reluctantly stepping out. 


“Wow this place is empty, not a single animal in sight.”


“Yup, just the two of us!”


“Sooo, what do we do now?”


“I want to build a snow fort! It’ll be a bit of work but it’ll be super fun and we’ll be out of the cold too. Here follow my lead.” Forced manual labor wasn’t exactly what I had planned to do that day but with Malarie’s grin ear to ear I didn’t really have a choice. Despite feeling like I was about to become a human popsicle the warmth in my chest I felt by just being able to talk about all the stupid things in life with her really helped pass the time.Thankfully before the sun stopped shining we finished and as we stepped into the hole Malarie called our room we could finally rest. 


“It really is so much warmer in here, how does that even work, isn’t it all snow?”


“It’s because the snow is really compact and when…”


Truthfully I didn’t care. If it was warm that’s all I needed to know but Malarie only really talks to me so I just let her go on like she does. When she first started camping with her dad she wouldn’t shut up about it. Sometimes it was annoying but that day it was more adorable than anything. 


“… and so that’s how we can stay warm in here.”


“Nerd.”


“Wha- hey what was that for…”


“What it’s not a bad thing, if you’re a nerd you’re a nerd.”


“Well I’ve got the better athletics grade.”


“Hehe, Bringing up grades doesn’t help your case.”


“Meanie…”


“Aw come on don’t pout like that. You’re too cute sometimes you know that.”


“Huh! What do you mean! Cute! But you were just, ah! You’re horrible…” I loved to tease Malarie and usually I knew when to quit but I guess that day I just let it slip. She could barely stand to look at me as she dug her head in her hands.


“I’m cold…”


“How you’re the one who were like a million layers?”


“I just am…” She wormed her way so close I could feel her heartbeat race. Her face was awfully red but even so her hands couldn’t cover her wide smile as she nuzzled into my chest.


“If I promise to always be there for you will you do the same?”


“Ye-yeah of course, I’ve got you always. You know that.” She finally looked at me with those sweet eyes. With her hands out of the way I saw her face, she was always cute but never had she seemed so pretty before. She closed her eyes and before I knew it she fell asleep. It’s funny really Malarie's go-to excuse for her always looking so tired was that she could never sleep well but whenever we were together she always fell asleep first. I think I knew it then even if only subconsciously. As I hugged her tight she slept peacefully with not a care in the world. Truthfully my face was even redder than hers. 

 —

The universe is a cruel bitch. In an instant your life could be shattered and it wouldn’t even matter to the greater world. Strangely I woke up with the same dread in my stomach from before. It was confusing for sure but it wasn’t what immediately set me off. Malarie was missing. When I processed it I jumped up and immediately called out her name. I was hoping to hear her mundane reply but instead what called back was utterly inhuman. No animal or machine could’ve made that vile tune. I was stunned but I had to find Malarie. As I left the hole I went into the small corridor-like trench that led up towards the surface and saw her there. 


“Malarie!” Before I got another word out she rushed at me. With her free hand she covered my mouth and practically pushed me onto the ground.


“Malarie what the hell!” 

She looked at me with terror in her eyes as her other hand clung tightly to her now glowing amulet. It was then when I saw it. The human mind naturally tries to interrupt shapes into familiar objects but there is nothing to relate that thing to. A shadow would give it that human quality it doesn’t deserve to hold on to but it’s the closest thing I could think of. Staring at it broke what I thought I knew about this world, and despite not being able to process its full being I just knew it was looking back at me. It just faced us for what felt like an eternity, every second my mind falling deeper into the abyss but Malarie seemed to fare even worse. Her once warm face was drained and pale, she looked like she was about to fold, and her breathing, oh god. It sounded like the final gasps of a dying man. When it moved I couldn’t hold back anymore. Screaming I saw its manifested arm reach towards her amulet and as it encroached it was stripping away at the space around. It was literally tearing the very reality around her amulet! 


“Please… let go!”


I guess it was just a cruel twist of fate that the amulet decided then to react and as it glowed fiercely the thing started to dissipate and with some otherworldly screech it had completely vanished.
 

Thud 


Malarie collapsed hard. She was out and all that was left was my body and the relentless cold. I wish I could say that I was able to get up and help Malarie to her truck. I wish I could say that I drove us out of there. But I didn’t do anything, instead I laid there knees anchored in the snow as my mind went blank I collapsed exhausted right next to her.

—

“Kate come on, we have to get out of here!” I woke up to Malarie shaking me awake. The pure bliss that falling asleep had afforded me was gone and I didn’t have the balls to keep going. Staring at her I let it all out. My eyes became waterfalls and as I threatened to break Malarie was quick to embrace me. For a minute she held me in her arms, my face in her chest as she tightly squeezed. I was able to regain my breath.


“Hey remember when we went bungee jumping that one time and you practically made me deaf when the instructor pushed you?”


“Yeah…”


“I think you finally beat that scream today.” Reminiscing at our past experiences helped me to focus on something other than and before I knew it we were in her truck ready to get out of this nightmare. 


Rumble clik clik 


The truck wouldn’t start. 


Slam


“Damn! Stay here, let me check the engine.” I stayed wrapped up in my blanket as I watched her hop out and lift the hood of the car. I saw the moment when her armor chipped. Her eyes widened and her complexion drained. I couldn’t see much from my end but the edges of the hood looked scrambled. It was as if someone had literally rearranged the very atoms that made up that part of the world. She slowly walked to my side of the door and laid her head on my chest.


“Are we gonna die here…” It was all I could think to say. 

“…no, you’ll be okay I promise.” 


Her voice shook and her breathing was shaky too. She took a small moment to catch her breath and she spoke again.


“There’s a more public camping site in the area. If we start walking we might make it before nightfall.”


“Oh…”


She took my hand in hers and helped me out of the truck. Reality was starting to sink in again and the cold biting at my already deteriorating mind didn’t help either. I moved my feet but I didn’t walk. My body repeating the same motion as Malarie dragged me along. 


“You know we should really check out that new restaurant they opened in town… I don’t really like sushi but I know you do.”


“Yeah…”


“We should go when we get back.”


“Sure…”


The only reason I could even trudge forward was because of the warmth of Malarie’s hand. She did her best to drive away the fear but as the snow wore us down and the sun retracted its blessings she apologized.


“Sorry Kate…”


We both knew that once the light was gone it was going to come back. All we could do now was hope that we reached the camping site before it got to us. I had never felt so empty before, it wasn’t fear anymore. I don’t know how long we kept walking but I remember instantly knowing the moment it started to follow us again. I didn’t even bother to look back; I just simply let Malarie drag my comatose body through the snow. A minute passed then another and I could feel its otherworldly presence slowly enveloping my body. The only other noise we could hear now was that of Malarie’s heavy panting as she stubbornly trekked through the snow. I couldn’t even dignify us with a quick death. Instead I felt a sense that I was being completely surrounded by its presence. The reality around was slowly being stripped away and as we crested the mass meekly imitating our world we saw in the distance a brightly lit cabin taunting us in the dark.


“Kate, I’m sorry.. this is my fault I should’ve done more to protect you, but I’ll make things right.” As she let go of my hand she looked me in my eyes and found my fragile soul.


“I love you Katelyn, please don’t ever forget that.”


I think a part of me had known for a while but I never really wanted to think about it. She walked straight past me and as the creature manifested its arm it quickly stripped away at the space around her. The amulet red and glowing could simply not stop it this time, and as I watched her slowly lose her shape I made a choice. Lunging forward I grabbed the amulet. I drove it into where I thought that thing was. But it rejected it and slammed me back into the snow. I felt it stare down my soul then.


“Wait!! Please why does it matter, why does it have to be her! You can’t even tell us apart!” I saw her drop to her knees and grovel on the ground like she was some elementary kid again. 


“Please, Please! I’ll allow you to have my body just, please leave her alone!”


I don’t know why that thing decided to listen to her prayers but I saw it take her away. It was something out of a nightmare. Its manifested hand slowly stripped away at her body until the space she occupied was no more. I didn’t have the energy to scream, I didn't have the energy to move. I couldn’t even face her as she smiled. I just passed out in the snow again. Unable to do a thing.  


Laying here in this hospital room typing this out it hurts a lot. Malarie had found the time to pick up the pieces of my soul and slowly piece them together. Her words saved me, and I was far too weak to do the same. Hell! I was too weak to even make her sacrifice matter! It was luck that really saved me as my frigid body lay there in the snow. It was a stranger who spotted me. Even now I can’t do a damn thing but watch from the window as rescue team after rescue team attempts the impossible. She’s gone now but I promise I’m going to find her. This time I’m going to save Malarie. I don’t care if it’ll take me the rest of my days but I need to get her back. She poured her heart out and I was unable to respond but I will never forget. Malarie I love you.
