English isn't my first language so forgive my grammar. This is my favorite story that I like to share. 

Back when I was in elementary school, I was very clingy with my cousins on my mother side. We get along very well and as a kid, I would beg to stay with them as long as possible every time we meet. 

In this particular situation, my cousins was about to ride a train back to their home which is extremely far away from mine. I was devastated and begged my parents to let me go with them, which I succeeded. The train ride was definitely memorable as it's my first train journey ever but it wasn't necessary so back to story.

We arrived at their home. It wasn't my first time visiting so we were just chilling, playing together like kids do. There wasn't much to tell until the night fall. I usually sleep with my parents, although this time I came alone so I sleep in the same room as my cousins. I was extremely contented to be sleeping over, but much as I wanted to be with my cousins, I couldn't shake a particular feeling.

I was extremely young and I have never had a night without my mom before. When I asked to come with them, I didn't think this through and it began to get to me. I missed her.

So there I was, getting out of my futon in the dark with tears in my eyes. I walked to my cousin's bed, who is my mom's sister in law. I tapped her shoulder for a few time then I quietly sniffed;

"I want my mama"

"Can you bring me to mama?"

"I don't wanna be here anymore"

I said as I try to hold my sob because I didn't want to wake the whole room up. What I saw in the dark was her moving back slightly, she didn't react anything else at all. Just that.

I tried to say it again a few times but with no reaction, I thought she was still sleeping. It was very dark so I couldn't see her face, just a silhouette of her body. I didn't want to bother her anymore so I try to hold it in and went back to bed, comforting myself until I eventually fell asleep.

In the morning, I went downstairs to get a breakfast when I heard the adults were talking. I didn't care much about them until I heard her speaking about going to a church, so I decided to eavesdrop a bit.

"I'm thinking of going to a church today. I really should" My aunt said in a slightly distraught tone.

"Why? Did you saw a ghost?" My uncle asked, teasing her for she's not very religious.

"Last night I saw a little girl standing beside me. She was crying and telling me that she wanted her mommy. I was scared shitless I couldn't move" She replied.

The conversation went on as the other adults were very interested. I don't remember it because all that in my head after that was

SHIT THAT WAS ME
