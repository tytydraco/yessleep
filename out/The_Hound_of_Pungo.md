When most people think of Virginia Beach, they think of the beach itself, the boardwalk, and the restaurants and surrounding tourist areas. I grew up in a lesser-known area of Virginia Beach called Pungo which, at the time, consisted of large swaths of farmland and undeveloped wooded land. I always thought of it as a kind of last frontier of Virginia Beach and its surrounding cities because of that.

Most families in that area had lived there for a couple of generations at least, so even though my family moved there when I was a toddler, we were still more or less considered ‘newcomers’ years later. Not that anyone was ever rude to us, you understand, but we don’t have the same deep friendships with our neighbors which stretch back, as I said, several generations, as they have with each other. I did have a couple of close friendships with some of the other kids in the area because kids don’t think about how far back a family’s ties go. Our thought process is more like, “Oh, you like LEGO, too (you could substitute any toy here, but my favorite was LEGO)? Let’s be best friends!”

One of my friends lived next door to me. The only issue with this is that “next door” meant across a big field and through some woods. So, to go over to his house meant crossing the field (the guy who leased that field grew corn there, so this could mean an easy trek after harvest or a slow, maze-like one prior to the corn being harvested). Either way, once past that, I would cross through the woods which could take about 30 minutes of walking and then I’d end up on our neighbor’s property.

Honestly, it made for a peaceful walk. My friend and I had cleared a path over time (which we were proud of) that made traveling from my place to his much easier than it would have otherwise been. So much so that, if I kept to the path, I could make my way back home in the dark with little issue. The path wasn’t quite a straight shot, though. We found out on day one of exploring the woods that there was this ramshackle cabin about 25 yards off to the left of what would have been a straight shot to my friend’s house.

The first time we saw the cabin, we weren’t sure if anyone lived there. It looked run down, but there were no broken windows and, while there wasn’t a lawn in the traditional sense (it’s difficult to grow grass in a spot like that due to all the shade from the trees), there were some planters where someone was trying to grow what looked like tomatoes and a few other vegetables. Those weren’t exactly thriving either, probably also due to the little sunlight that was able to filter down through the leaves. I think it was our second time cutting through the woods that we realized someone did live in that cabin and that we were not exactly welcome.

As we walked by the cabin, we heard a muffled bark from what must have been a huge dog. Neither one of us could identify what breed it was and sounded sort of ‘off’ somehow. It startled us enough that we ran back to my friend’s house. As we turned to run, we heard a window open and a deep, booming, man’s voice yell something that we couldn’t quite make out as we sprinted away from the cabin.

That experience was at the forefront of our minds when we cleared the trail connecting our properties. The result was that it was curved enough that it avoided that cabin altogether but tacked on another 5-10 minutes to our walks. We stuck to the trail every time we cut through those woods from that point onwards. I only deviated from it once and it only took that one time to keep me from ever doing it again.
It was on a day that I spent playing at my friend’s house. It was late Fall, so the days had gotten shorter and before I knew it, it was getting dark. Seeing this, I decided to head back home and double-time it, so my parents didn’t give me a lecture for coming home after dark. It occurred to me that, in the low dusk lighting, I might be able to venture off the trail and take a straight shot back to my house without the owner of the cabin seeing me.

I was able to make it just past the cabin when I heard the muffled barking from inside and the sound of the door opening! I have never run so fast in my life. I could hear what must have been an enormous dog chasing after me. I could also hear its bark more clearly now and it sounded way more ‘off’ than before, but I still couldn’t decide what it was about it that unnerved me so much. My legs were starting to feel like Jell-O and I could hear the dog getting closer. That’s all I needed to hear to put every last ounce of energy I had into my sprint.

I made it through the trees and reached the corn field which I ran into blindly in my attempt to escape the dog. About halfway through the field, I noticed that I didn’t hear it chasing me anymore, so I slowed my pace a little more and made it back to my house in one piece. In hindsight, my parents could probably see that I’d been scared by something, but all I told them was that it had been getting dark and the woods were creepy at night. I never did cut through those woods again and, from that point onwards, I just asked my mom to drive me to my friend’s place.

Now, hindsight is a funny thing. When you look back as an adult at the things that happened to you as a kid, the extra life experience and, in this case, additional context from my parents, makes you realize just how skewed your perception of events from your childhood was. However, in my defense, I don’t think I ever would have realized just how skewed they were regarding the incident I just talked about without my parents explaining it to me.

They had moved to a different house in the city when I was in college, and I’d carve out some time to visit them between semesters. During my break leading up to my final semester, I was staying with my parents, and we were reminiscing about the old house in Pungo and how so much of that land had now been developed. They knew about the path I used to cut through the woods, but I had never told them about my experience with the cabin or being chased by that dog. Since we were reminiscing, I decided to go ahead and tell my parents about it since I thought it would seem funny to them so many years later.
The laughter died on their lips immediately and there was silence for a moment. My dad was the one that broke it. He said that he’d meant to tell me this when he and my mom found out, but between semester breaks, it had slipped their minds. They found out about the existence of that cabin the year I went away to college because of a local girl who had gone missing in the area. It turned out that the search led straight to it.

Both my parents and my friend’s parents were in utter disbelief because, unbeknownst to my friend and me at the time, that was part of my friend’s family’s property. You don’t think about those kinds of things as kids, but it made sense why both our parents felt comfortable allowing us to traverse the woods alone – they owned the land, so in theory, it should have been safe. According to my dad, the cabin existed there prior to my friend’s family buying the property and no one was supposed to be living there. So, when the search for this missing girl led police there, they were surprised to find this old, but huge, bear of a man had been squatting there for years.

There was another pause in the conversation, and I asked what happened to the girl and what became of the squatter’s dog. I regret asking that to this day… My dad gave me a confused look and responded, “They never found a dog; the man was living alone, but he wasn’t right in the head. Will, the Sheriff’s Deputy told me they knew there was something wrong with him the second they walked into that cabin. In fact, I’m not even sure the word ‘man’ would still apply in this case. Apparently, they walked in, and he was crab walking -QUICKLY -up to the officers and barking like a dog. They did find the remains of the girl in the cabin, but it was mostly gnawed-on bones at that point. Forensics showed human teeth marks all over them…” He gave me a grim look and added, “Some of the locals have now dubbed the man, ‘The Hound of Pungo.’”
