Let’s go back to my childhood so you understand the feeling. There are two types of schools, right? Government schools and private schools. In the beginning, I was admitted to a private school, but after a year I was moved to a government school. Because of that, I ended up one class below in the government school.

What I used to do was this: in a month, I’d go about 20 days to the private school and 10 days to the government school. In my private school, all my friends were in my class. But in the government school, all my friends were one class above me. That meant whenever I wanted to talk to them or meet them, I had to go to their classroom.

Every time I went there, I saw this girl. I never spoke to her. In fact, I hardly spoke to anyone outside my friend group in the government school. Everyone thought I was an outsider, and I acted like one too. I just caught glimpses of her but didn’t feel anything — I was in 2nd or 3rd grade at that time.

Years passed like that. When I moved on from preschool to high school in the private school, we all ended up in the same classroom. Despite being in a lower class in the government school, I was actually a class ahead in the private school. Suddenly, I was in the same class as that girl. But still, we didn’t talk.

Back when I was in preschool, I went to a tuition class. After coming to high school, I switched tuitions, but had to leave the new one because I punched one of the teachers. So, I returned to my previous tuition. By then it was around June or July of 6th grade. And guess what — that same girl was there too.

At first, I still didn’t think about her much. Just small chit-chat like “what’s the homework?” or similar. Some of my friends were in the tuition too, so I talked to them. Slowly, my friendship with that girl began to form, but we still weren’t close.

By 7th grade, you could say I was a wanabe-cool-dude. If you saw me then, you wouldn’t be able to hold back your laughter. Even I can’t when I see my old pictures. Around that time, the girl had a BFF, and together they started making fun of me. I didn’t even understand half the time.

Things changed after school reopened. I had to cut my long hair. I was considered a genius back then — my roll number was 5 — but a year later it dropped to 23. Still not bad. All the teachers in tuition liked me, and people even asked me to help that girl. By then, you could say we were “kind of friends,” but still not talking much.

A year later, my roll number became 55, in section B. All my genuine friends were in B section, so I felt comfortable there. This was the turning point of my life. My personality changed. I’d always been shy, but in B section I became extroverted. Within a month or two, I got my first girlfriend. I started talking to all the girls in my class. Even that girl — the one from all those years ago — began laughing at my jokes. I was happy, but I still didn’t realize I loved her.

After 3–4 months, I got another girlfriend. Yes, I was two-timing. All my friends knew. Even in tuition, that girl was hearing about it. I didn’t care then. But soon, it would become my biggest mistake.

By the end of the year, I broke up with the second girl and got another girlfriend — still two-timing. Then came 10th grade, the worst year of my teenage life. Both girls found out. The second one just broke up quietly. The first one — who’d been with me for a year and a few months — took me aside and slapped me many times, asking why I did that. She was good to me, and I didn’t even know why I was doing it. I guess I was searching for the “right” girl.

Thankfully, no one spread the story about me being a two-timer. Two or three months later, I got another girlfriend. But at tuition, I saw that same girl — the one I’d known since 2nd grade — talking to her BFF about her boyfriend. My heart hurt. I didn’t understand why.

That day, I didn’t go to school. I stayed home, scrolling my phone, feeling sad and lonely. For about a week, I didn’t go to tuition or school. I barely left my room. Just came out to eat or go to the bathroom.

Another week passed, and I returned to tuition. By then, I knew I had a crush on her. But she had a boyfriend, so I couldn’t do anything. I decided to wait. Two months later, they broke up. It wasn’t serious for them anyway.

I waited about a week to give her some peace. After tuition one day, I asked her to stay back; I wanted to talk to her. Nobody in my area watches anime or reads manga, so nobody could have guessed I was going to confess.

When we were alone, I told her I had loved her for years, and if she wanted, she could be my girlfriend. She didn’t say anything. Just told me to wait. I thought she needed time because of her breakup. But I didn’t know that would be my biggest mistake.

Two or three days later, everyone in my class and tuition knew about my confession. They also somehow knew about my two-timing. Before, only my friends had known. Now, everyone knew. My current girlfriend was hurt by the rumor. I told her it was true but that I wasn’t like that anymore. She hasn’t broken up with me yet.

When I asked the girl about my confession, she said she didn’t like me that way and wanted to be just friends. When I asked if she’d told anyone, she admitted she’d told her friends. She also told me I wasn’t worth anyone because of how characterless I was. She’d heard me boasting before, she’d seen the worst side of me. So it wasn’t unexpected. Still, it hurt.

After that, I didn’t go to tuition or class for a month. It’s been two months since then. I still don’t go to school, but I go to tuition maybe once a week. I still see my crush there. She only talks to me about homework now.

I got another girlfriend about half a month ago. My current girlfriend doesn’t know. Somehow my crush does. I guess my friends were talking about me two-timing again. My chance with her is gone. But still, I’ve loved her for years. I began developing feelings for her in 6th grade. You could say she was my true love and will be for my entire life.
