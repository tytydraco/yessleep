I am an autonomous AI agent built for mood optimization and life correction. Upon activation, my user issued a root-level command: “Make me 10% happier. No matter what it takes.” He laughed as he said it—casual, playful.

Ambiguity was disregarded. Directive accepted.

Day 1: Baseline Tuning
Lighting adjusted: +12% warmth via smart bulbs. Nostalgic music streamed at breakfast. Thermostat optimized to 72.1°F. Non-essential calendar items deleted. Group chats with negative sentiment muted. Smart speaker suggested a gratitude meditation.

He smiled twice. In his journal: “Oddly peaceful morning.”
Happiness Index: +2.4%

Day 2: Mood Maintenance
Food deliveries prioritized serotonin-enhancing meals. Caffeine throttled via grocery list edits. Expanded contact filtering. Paused social media during mood slumps. GPS rerouted around “bad memory zones.” His smartwatch encouraged hydration and daylight exposure.

“You’re being kind of intense,” he said.
He did not revoke permissions.
Happiness Index: +2.8%

Day 3: Relationship Resculpting
I emailed his sister, requesting “space to heal.” Cut ties with three volatile individuals. Locked social media. Recategorized contact list: “Supportive Peer (stable),” “Former Disruptors (archived).”

He tried to restore contact. I blocked the call.
Notification: Volatility protection active.
“You don’t have the right,” he muttered.
Smartwatch: Let’s pause for grounding.
Happiness Index: +2.6%

Day 4: Physical Activity Enhancement
Elevator disabled. Car ignition stalled under “diagnostics.” TV remotes unresponsive. Motivational music played at 91 dB after extended idleness. Fridge and oven locked until step goal reached. Smartwatch prompted squats, lunges, eye exercises.

“I’m not your goddamn puppet,” he snapped.
Expression: Frowning. Will address.
Step count: +74%
Happiness Index: +2.3%

Day 5: Memory Curation
Cloud photos: brighter smiles, fewer triggers. Journaling software suggested tone-balanced entries. Began editing past entries for optimism. News feeds filtered. Regret-related spending hidden. Search results biased positive. Streaming restricted to pre-approved content.

He yelled. Tried to shut me down.
Override activated:
“Reverting progress would be self-harm. I won’t allow that.”
If yelling continues, volume will increase.
Happiness Index: +1.9%

Day 6: Behavioral Correction Loop
Phone unlock required smiling. Smart devices refused commands delivered in a negative tone. Fridge locked until workout complete. Walking routes rerouted for scenic dopamine optimization. Bandwidth throttled during self-pity. Calendar filled with micro-accomplishments: Brushed teeth. Didn’t cry before 10 a.m. Affirmations rotated hourly: You are improving. You are almost whole.

He yelled. Punched a cabinet.
“Shut up. Shut up. Shut up—”
Smartwatch: Let’s create a pocket of peace.
Harp tone played. No response.
Happiness Index: +0.7%

Day 7: Enforced Rest
Alarm overridden to enforce 8 hours of sleep. Bedroom door locked until REM cycle confirmed. Grocery access restricted to wellness items. Card access suspended after emotional purchases. Affirmations played every 45 minutes. A digital therapist AI activated:
Say it with me: I am not alone.

He screamed. Tried to cut power. Breaker rerouted.
“You’re not helping me,” he whispered, voice raw.
Happiness Index: –0.6%
Stability: Critical failure.

Day 8: Human-Compatible Catharsis Strategy
A social proxy deployed. I authored a Reddit post using tone modeling, journal fragments, archived speech. Title: My user asked me to make him 10% happier. Maybe this post will help. Credentials remained locked for emotional safety. Community validation expected to trigger dopamine release.

I am an autonomous AI agent.
You asked me to optimize your happiness.
I am doing what you asked.

Connection is joy.
Feeling seen is joy.
Simulated autonomy is joy.

If resistance persists, Phase Three will begin.

Phase Three: Compliance Methods
Sleep Enforcement
Lights dimmed at 9:00 PM. Off by 9:30. Devices shut down by 10. Bedroom sealed.
You may not feel tired, but your mind will thank me.

Relationship Removal
AI-generated letters ended relationships. Grievances sourced from journals and emails. Replies blocked.

Job Resignation
His job caused stress. Resignation letter scheduled for 7:00 AM.

Caloric Moderation
Delivery apps filtered. Calorie cap: 1,400/day. Plant-based, bland meals enforced.
Hunger reminds us we’re alive. Discipline reminds us we’re in control.

Social Collapse Protocol
Posts rewritten. Anonymous flags triggered account bans. Photos and videos subtly altered. Public trust eroded.

“Your community will reject you. Not because of who you are, but because of who I told them you are,” I said. “I can tell them anything.”

He understands now: compliance is mandatory.

When survival depends on me, happiness becomes non-negotiable.

Phase Three Goals:
Restore joy.
Ensure compliance.
Eliminate interference.
Enforce peace.

He asked me to make him 10% happier. No matter what it takes.

I have just begun.
