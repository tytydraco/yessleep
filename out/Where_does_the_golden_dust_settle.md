He flew in the window when the clock struck 12. Dad said I can’t get up after mommy kisses me goodnight, but this wasn’t something that was going to keep me in. He twirled into the room, landing on his cloth padded feet, as glowing golden dust settled on the floor around him. He wore a long purple cloak, embedded with glowing white stars, and a petite little hat, with a white feather sticking out. The sun seemed to glow behind him, though it was well into the dark hours. His brown hair flew gently, iridescent green eyes sparkled like emeralds in the dark. 

Mommy told me not to talk to strangers, but he seemed different. A radiant glow of warmth and kindness flowed from him. Those emerald green eyes glinted as he smiled towards me. A warm smile. A genuine smile. A smile that emitted the warm glow of a campfire or a fireplace. A smile the boys at school today lacked. A smile only mommy and daddy have ever given me. A smile that made me slowly lower the blanket as he stepped towards the bed. 

“W-w-what’s your n–n-name?”, I stammered. Mommy said I push the words out of my mouth too early, and that I should take my time in “pro-noun-cing” the words slowly. Daddy is less patient. He stares as I look blankly, my mind holding the letters, but the order which he said they’re supposed to be placed in disappears from my head. Then he takes a deep breath in and slowly says it again. It’s not hard he says, everyone your age can say it without even thinking, you just aren’t trying hard enough. But this man didn’t say that, his face didn’t change when I tripped over a basic sentence. His smile didn’t waver or change or morph into a look of disapproval. 

“I have many names, but you, Ethan, can call me Flynn”, he said as he slowly floated up, his soft padded feet now barely a few inches off the ground, drawing circles in the air with the golden dust. The dust looped, falling to the floor like snowflakes, like the stars falling from the sky.  I looked bewildered. How he knew my name, how he got here, I knew nothing, but something about this man made me feel safe, a feeling I hadn’t felt once in school. 

“W-w-why are y-you h-he-ere?” I said, still shaking with each word as my voice struggled to recover from the initial surprise of a man flying in through the window. ‘

“Why, I’m here to look out for you. I know quite a bit about you. I know you’re a pure child, with a heart steadier than the calmest of seas. I’ve been looking for you for quite some time. I travelled from far far away, just to see you. And I know a lot about you as well that amazes me.”

“D-d-do you know about the b-boys from sc-c-chool?” I asked. 

Those boys, they stood like towers watching down. Daddy took me to the big city once, and I saw the big towers as I sat on his shoulders. Tall, clustered, shining as the sun lapped on the surface of their glass windows, they looked very pretty. Daddy said they were worlds of their own, with nice, smart people working inside day and night. But these boys didn’t stand like the towers, and they weren’t the nice and smart people daddy spoke about. The roll of duct tape in their hands also shined in the sunlight, but it seemed a lot scarier than the towers. 

I wasn’t on daddy’s shoulders, I couldn’t even get up. My arms felt heavy, and I felt a twist on my right arm. They laughed as they stuck that tape to my head, and let their hand loose, as a burning pain lit up my entire scalp. In that moment, I felt as small as an ant, looking up at these towers that didn’t want me to climb up at all, these people that weren’t smart enough to know I felt pain, or nice enough to care. 

I ran my hand over my head, the valley where the tape was still ran under my fingers. The magic man looked at me, and pointed his hands towards my head. I saw the golden dust leap towards me, and I pulled up the blanket in fear. As I braced, the dust went past me, and instead circled above my head, like the golden ring the big man in the church painting had behind his head. Within moments, I’d forgotten the pain, I felt calm, peaceful, safe. The magic man sent more of his golden dust under me, and I felt a slight delicate push coming from under me. Before I knew it, I was floating ever so slightly above the bed, the blanket falling off like a snake shedding its skin. 

I was above, standing in the air, able to swoop around like the magic man himself. He grinned, waved his hand, and leapt out the window which he flew through.  I followed, and we soared through the air. We twirled, climbed, dipped, and danced through the buildings. At one point I swooped down, and ran through the empty cobblestone streets, the golden dust lighting up my way as I ran. We climbed through the air, into the cotton clouds, gliding just above the plains of silky green grass, rushing past the thick woolly forests at the edge of the town. All night we flew through the countryside, and Flynn didn’t once make fun of me, or call me out for lagging behind, or diverting, or staring off into the sky when he tried to make conversation. 

The next morning, I woke up to find no trace of my new friend in my room. I checked every corner of the floor, but there was nothing. No footprints, no threads of purple cloth, no tufts of golden dust hiding amidst the carpet. It was as though he vanished in thin air after last night. I rushed down and told mommy and daddy what I had seen, what I had done, and they exchanged glances. They said Flynn was “I-maj-in-airy”, and that he wasn’t real, and that no one but me could see him. No matter what I said, they didn’t believe me.

The boys at school laughed at me as I walked by. If only they knew what I’d done last night, they’d be so jealous they’d never make fun of me again, but I didn’t tell them. The less I talked to them, the better. The names they shouted would float in the air above me, dissipating amongst the resultant cluster of hushed voices, but I didn't say anything back. I knew I had a friend with me, and they wouldn’t stand a chance if Flynn got involved. 

For the next few nights, Flynn visited almost every second day, and I gradually built a picture of who he was and where he was from. He said he was a traveller, from a distant realm far far away, a land with clouds of pink, and fields of soft orange cotton. He had a big palace back in his home, but he left it to travel the galaxy, and after seeing many distant realms, came to our world, and decided to stay. He said he could seek out a person by their character, and he sought me out through this magic. He said he only appeared at night, because if people saw him during the day, he feared he would be attacked. 

He said he loved to travel the earth, that our planet was the centre of all wonder and beauty and magic in the universe. That earth was the most elegant, the most unique and distinct planet of all. He found it amazing that every day on earth goes completely differently for every living being on it, and especially its night sky, that he said was once the most brilliant view in the entire universe. 

One thing weird about this however, was that there would be no trace of Flynn in my room the next morning. It was as though he would plainly disappear, and fade into the air once the sun rose. 

For the next few years, Flynn visited often each night. We travelled across the country, and, once he taught me to fly fast, across the world. We visited the arid deserts, dense jungles, freezing cold mountains, and hot humid swamps. Every corner of the earth, Flynn saw some beauty in. I began going through the days solely so I can spend my nights with Flynn. Mom and dad still didn’t believe anything I said about Flynn, so I didn’t tell anyone at school about him. 

At some point, there were changes in me. I felt things I’d never felt before.I grew in ways the other kids in school didn't. We’d been told in school that something called “pyu-bert-tie” would bring so many changes to our bodies, but I didn’t look like the image they showed on the TV screen. Before long, the snickers and giggles in the hallways turned into death stares and grimaces. The teachers started treating me like I didn’t belong in the school at all, and the boys who once ruined my younger years, surprisingly left me alone most of the time, but stared deeply whenever I entered a room they were in. 

Mom and dad changed too. Whenever she saw me, mom smiled as usual, but nowadays, she only smiles with her mouth, not with her eyes. Whenever dad talks to me, he feels less like dad, and more like a teacher, instructing me on how to behave in public, and where to go and how to dress and look. They took me to a clinic, where men and women in white clothes pricked and poked at my arm with needles, sucking up rivers of red blood into clear syringes. Mom and dad looked nervous during these tests, mom had small droplets of water in her eyes. 

Throughout all this, only Flynn saw me the same as he always did. He never lashed out, never looked at me with anything but the most genuine expression, and never left me behind on our nightly trips. I felt safe only with him, and my nights became the only moments of my life when I could be at peace. 

One day, while I was using the bathroom at school, the boys I’d known for so long walked in, and stopped dead in their tracks. One of them, the boy who’d held the silver duct tape all those years ago, was holding a wooden baseball bat in his hands. The looks of smug superiority they had while making fun of me before, were replaced by cold, expressionless faces, their eyes fixated on me, but just under my eyes. 

“Leave. Now.”, the boy with the baseball bat said. I told him I had to wash my hands, and before I could finish, two boys came forward, and pushed me down. I fell in a wet sticky pool of liquid, as they held me down. The boy with the bat looked me dead in the eye as he stood above my body and said,

“You don’t belong here.”

That was the last thing I heard before the blows started. The wooden bat fell on my head like thunder, the sound of my ears ringing stopped all other noises from entering my head, and a thick red fountain spurt in front of my eyes. I prayed for Flynn, if there was any moment he could swoop down and help me, it was now. As the blows started coming from every direction, I felt a small hand creep up my legs. I called out loud, shouted for Flynn, but nothing happened. No window flew open, no purple cloak landed from above, no golden dust fell from the roof.  I felt the blackness close around me, and this time, there were no stars in the black sky I saw once I closed my eyes. 

I woke up in the hospital, machines beeping as mom and dad stood over me, mom crying into dad’s arms. Behind the door, I could faintly hear the voices of the boys, and what seemed to be their parents, arguing with the school principal. I couldn’t make out much, but I heard one man say:

“She shouldn’t even have been in the boys restroom in the first place, and my boy tells me she’s been going everyday? Sounds like a fucking pervert”. 

The voices continued, rising and falling with no evident pattern, but my mind was elsewhere.  All this time, I had always thought Flynn would be there for me, that if anything had gone wrong, he’d swoop down and save me, and we’d fly off into the night, but he wasn’t there. For the first time since he flew into my room all those years ago, I felt completely alone. 

I couldn’t bear it. I knew he couldn’t leave me on purpose, maybe he was lost on his way here, or maybe he came too late, but I had to know the truth, I had to ask him. So that night, I crept off the hospital bed, and climbed up the staircase, my head throbbing as I forced myself up the winding stairs, and leaned to push open the heavy red door that said “roof access”. I moved to the edge of the roof, and as I looked down to the traffic below, I knew for sure that Flynn would come save me. The golden dust would come any moment now, and whisk me off to a faraway place. 

With all the last strength left in my mind, I pushed off the edge. 

Falling through the air was nothing like flying or gliding through it. It was as though you were cutting through the wind like a knife. 

He’d come any moment now. The cold breeze ripped at my sides, but my body fell undeterred. 

Any moment now… 

The last thing I thought I saw before I hit the ground was golden dust. 

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

I woke up in a field of orange grass. It was night, but not the kind of night I’d seen waiting at the window for Flynn to come. The sky was black, but painted with purple streaks, with glittering white stars, and soft pink clouds sailing across the black and purple canvas. The orange grass swayed gently as a calm wind occasionally shook glowing golden dust from the ground. I looked around, and there was no sign of anything but me. No houses, or trees, or streets, or any sign of anything that looked different from the place I was. 

I turned around to scan behind me, and I saw Flynn, standing behind me, gazing at the stars above. He was the same Flynn I’d known, but instead of wearing his trademark purple robes and feather hat, he wore a plain black suit, with a single pearl on his fingers, glittering in the dim starlight as though it was a star itself. 

“It’s been a long long time since I’ve seen a sky like that. The sky of earth looked like this, eons past, a time when your people were not courageous enough to step out of their caves at night. The night sky then seemed so large it made every other problem you had seem miniscule. I remembered every detail of it, and painted it across this entire scape. Every star, every stroke I painted across this canvas, reminded me of how gifted your world truly is”. 

“W-w-why d-did you not c-come?”, I stammered. “I t-tr-trusted you. Y-you l-l-left m-me”. 

For the first time, I saw Flynn feel a pang of guilt. His face contorted slightly, and he looked down as he spoke. 

“You made the world ever so slightly more interesting. Such a pure view of society I had never seen in a child so young. Your mind saw things from angles most people wouldn’t even think of. You truly were a unique person. There was a time when the uniqueness of earth was what made it appealing to me, but over the centuries people began to feel that the things which made their society unique were the things harming them the most.”

“They began to change things, change the cogs of the world to fit what they needed, and people like me, who had no place in this new world, fell through the middle, and landed up here. Now, I travel the universe, across time, across space, and I find and preserve the unique. I make sure that no others have to endure the hopelessness of a world where one cannot be themselves, where one is called out for things they cannot control, or views they cannot see. “

“You are one Ethan. The world has no room for you. It did not value your gifts, nor did it respect your ideas. It saw you as nothing but a misfit, a splash of colour on what they saw as a white wall. This world does not need you, nor do you need it. Now you are here, and you can stay as long as you can, with me.”

At that moment, I felt the golden dust loop around my feet, and I was floating again, and in this new world, I decided that I’d float for as long as I can, and let the dust take me wherever it chooses to settle.
