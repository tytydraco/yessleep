A shiver of dread unraveled down my spine as I stared at the tattered photo  - the rotting hull half swallowed in the murky mud beneath the waves. The old diver's words came back to haunt me: "That thing livin' down there don't want none of us comin' back up alive." I chuckled then, but now a bone-chilling fear took hold of my heart, clenched it tight.     

The wreck's treasure would make my pockets a lot heavier, if I could haul it to the surface. The client watched me with greedy eyes. I knew in my core I should refuse, yet the fortune called to me like a song of the damned. I took a breath that shuddered in my lungs. "I'll raise her, " I rasped.        

And at last as the boat faded into the fog, I breathed deep to steady my pounding heart. I told myself I could survive this dive - I just had to keep calm and stay focused.     

I checked my gear one final time and gulped a lungful of fresh air before descending into the murky deep. Fish swarmed around me in a sparkling cloud, curious at the strange intruder in their watery kingdom. Shrimp darted in and out of coral reefs. Sunlight still filtered down, a golden glow that should keep me calm.     

I sank deeper. The colorful fish thinned. The water grew colder, and trepidation crept in. I flicked on my lamps, flooding the murk with harsh light, revealing warped shapes hiding just beyond the glow.    

I descended further into the inky sea. The water pressed against me, chill and alien. I paused to adjust my gear, and that's when I glimpsed it - a bleached, bloated hand clinging to the metal hull, weeds streaming from twisted fingertips. Revulsion seized me as I saw there were many more - a cluster of pallid bloated corpses fused to the broken metal. They seemed lifeless... yet as I watched, one slowly swiveled an eyeless head towards me.    

My blood froze in my veins. I could feel a malevolent intelligence watching - hungry and hateful. I kicked away from the hull and the corpses clinging to it, rising panic consuming me. Grasping my oxygen line, I swam deeper into the wreck. Schools of gaudy fish fled before me as I explored further into the ship's rotten corridors. The water grew even colder.   

Columns of rust obscured my view. Glowing green and yellow algae coated the walls, casting an eerie sheen over my surroundings. I scanned for any more entities like those on the hull, but saw nothing - for now. My need for the treasure fought against the dread that chilled my insides.          

I forced myself to go on searching. The uncanny corpses stood staring, gaze following me. I bit back a shudder as I journeyed yet deeper into the wreck.       

Finally I found an iron door leading to the ship's stronghold. With much effort I forced it open. Peering within I saw piles of trunks and cargo cases, many still sealed. Ecstasy and relief washed through me - this was what I came for!         

I began sorting through the trunks and cases, uncovering treasures beyond my wildest imaginings - gold coins, gems, relics. I stuffed my bags full, delirious with fortune. But as I turned to depart the stronghold, a chill washed over me. I saw the corpses now blocking my way out. Dozens stared with dead, glassy eyes, some no eyes at all.      

As they shifted, their limbs groaned dreadfully, seeming rusted from decades beneath the waves. Their skin looked translucent and bloated from long submersion, akin to boiled fowl flesh. But what filled me with most horror were their gazes - though lifeless, they glared with vicious purpose. A dry cackle escaped split lips as skeletal digits grasped for me. I knew in my heart I had awakened these creatures - now they desired to drown me due to my foolishness. 

Clutching a gold bar, I swung at the closest corpse, striking its skull with a sickening crack. The figure crumpled but two more replaced it. I swung again and again, smashing rotten limbs and torsos. Still they came, scraping at my suit. I kicked and pummeled, driven by desperation and instinct. My oxygen stores were plummeting swiftly. With a last sweeping heave of the gold bar I carved a passage and shot through the vault door. The corpses lunged but missed my heels.        

I burst from the wreck's half-caved face and stroked hard for the surface, desperately thrashing my fins as briny water seared my lungs. All beauty had fled the tropic sea. Fish scattered as the mob chased me up from the wreck's depths.       

As I ascended, the water shifted from ink-black to navy blue, then teal. Shafts of sunlight pierced the choppy waves, filling me with hope that I might escape this nightmare. I glanced behind - a swarm of the creatures rose swiftly, propelled by otherworldly strength and rage. Skeletal hands grasped for me through the water, inches from my flippers.            

I swam with furious strokes, putting all my energy into reaching the surface growing larger with each pull. My head burst the waves and I gulped fresh air, treading frantically as I searched for my boat. It was there, turning to recover me just in time. Hands hauled me aboard, yet not before several of the creatures surfaced, scaling the deck with horrifying speed.                

The crew erupted in panic at the sight of them. I grabbed an old machete and joined the fight, hacking at rotting limbs as they clawed at us. Some fell back into the sea, only to surge up again. It seemed we'd be overwhelmed, when suddenly the sun pierced the clouds, bathing the deck in light. The creatures withdrew, wailing, and threw themselves overboard. The last vanished with a final vicious hiss.        

My crew stared at me, stunned and bewildered. "What in blazes were those things?" the first mate finally called out. I slumped to the deck, exhausted.  

"Monsters," I replied. "The keepers of that ship... and they don't want anyone disturbing them again."      

I knew I had stolen from that ship at my own risk, yet still the treasure in my bags would make me a fortune... if I could outrun those dead-eyed fish that now hunted me.   

"Get us away from here, quick as you can," I told the first mate. "I have a feeling they'll return, and next time sunlight may not save us." The engines roared to life and we raced away, leaving that wreck & the hungry beasts that claimed it far behind us. But I wondered; how long could I escape their wrath now set loose upon the sea?
