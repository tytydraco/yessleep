I’ve debated posting this for a long time. But no matter how much time passes, I can’t forget what happened. Neither can Abigail. We don’t talk about it, not because we’re over it but every time we do, something always happens.

I don’t usually post stuff like this. Honestly, I still feel kind of crazy even thinking about it.

But it happened. And if you’re reading this, just listen. Please.

It was last summer, and everything at home was unraveling fast. My parents fought constantly. Not little arguments, loud, vicious fights that made the walls shake. About money. About trust. About things they thought I couldn’t understand. I used to sit in the hallway at night, hugging my knees, just in case it got physical. Sometimes, I swear I could hear glass breaking and someone crying behind the closed door.

One night, my mom snapped. She stuffed a few clothes into a bag, grabbed my arm, and told me we were leaving. No explanation, just that we were going to stay with her mother.

My grandmother.

I’d never met her. My mom barely spoke about her, and when she did, her voice always dropped a little. All I knew was that she lived in a small town tucked away in the hills, one of those places where even the dogs seem to know you don’t belong.

We got there just before the sun dipped behind the trees. Her house stood right at the edge of town, its roof bowed a little like it was tired of holding on. It smelled like cedar and mothballs and something else, like something that hadn’t been opened in a long time.

She hugged me when we arrived, but it wasn’t warm. It was tight. Lingering. Like she was trying to memorize me.

Then she whispered, “You should’ve stayed in the city.”

At first, I thought she was just being old and dramatic. But there was something in her eyes. Not fear exactly. More like guilt. Like she already knew something bad was waiting.

That night at dinner, she gave me one rule:

“Don’t go near the fence. Ever. I’m not joking.”

Her backyard stretched all the way to a tall, rusted wire fence tangled in overgrown grass and vines. Beyond that, nothing but dense, dark forest.

I asked why. She didn’t blink.

“Things out there don’t like to be noticed.”

That was all she said. Then she changed the subject like she hadn’t just dropped the creepiest line of my life.

A few days later, I called my best friend Abigail. I told her about the fence, the warning, the weird energy in the house. She got hooked fast. Started Googling local legends, checking Reddit, even joked about bringing sage.

Surprisingly, my mom said yes when I asked if Abigail could visit. I think she just wanted me distracted or maybe she wanted someone else to witness how strange it all felt.

Abigail arrived that weekend. We were just two bored girls stuck in a ghost town. We took long walks to the store, snapped selfies by the lake, tried to laugh off how weird everything felt.

But we couldn’t stop looking at that fence.

We didn’t mean to cross it. We didn’t dare each other. We just… wandered too close.

Saturday, just before sunset, we found a spot where the wire had been bent downward, like something had stepped over it and never returned.

We stepped past it.

Immediately, the air felt wrong. Not in a fantasy-movie kind of way. Just… too quiet. No wind. No insects. The trees seemed taller. Their branches hung low, like they were eavesdropping.

We followed a narrow path, barely a trail. The dirt was soft, marked with faint footprints. Crushed beer cans. A snapped flashlight. Other people had been here. Recently.

Then we heard it.

Breathing.

Slow. Measured. Not panicked. Not rushed.

Close.

Like someone was behind a tree. Just watching.

Abigail whispered, “Do you hear that?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Then, snap.

A single twig.

We bolted.

The run back felt endless. The forest warped behind us, trees blurring together. I fell once. Skinned my knee. Didn’t stop. My lungs burned. My vision tunneled. We didn’t stop until we hit the fence.

I tore my arm climbing over. Blood smeared the wire. I barely noticed.

We burst through the back door.

My grandma stood in the kitchen. Not shocked. Not angry.

She looked at Abigail and said calmly:

“Don’t leave your window open tonight.”

We didn’t sleep.

Around 3 a.m., I heard something. A soft, rhythmic tapping. Fingernails. On glass.

Abigail was already awake. I knew because she was crushing my hand, holding it so tight I thought it might bruise.

We didn’t look.

We just listened.

In the morning, there were fingerprints on the window. Not full prints. Just the tips.

Like someone had stood there, silently dragging their fingers across the glass. Waiting.

Nothing else happened.

We left the next morning.

Abigail never brought it up again. She deleted every picture from that weekend. Changed her number by the end of the year.

My mom doesn’t mention the visit either. When my grandma passed last month, she asked if I wanted to help clean out the house.

I said no.

But lately, I’ve been waking up at 3 a.m.

Not to tapping. Not to footsteps.

Just breathing.

Slow. Steady.

Like someone standing at the foot of my bed.
