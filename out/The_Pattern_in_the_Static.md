I don’t know how to start this. My hands are shaking as I type, and every creak in my apartment makes me jump. I haven’t slept in days, not really. When I close my eyes, I see it—the pattern. It’s in my head now, and I can’t make it stop. I’m posting this here because I need someone to know what happened, even if you think I’m losing it. I’m not. Or maybe I am. All I know is that it started with the TV, and now I can’t escape.



I'm a retro electronic Enthusiast and one day, I got an old CRT TV (Vintage RCA AFC 120Y) at the thrift store for it's retro vibe. It’s got dials for channels and a faint hum when it’s on and I’d leave it running in the background while I worked from home, usually tuned to some dead channel full of static. The white noise helped me focus. That was my first mistake.



About a month ago, I started noticing something in the static. It wasn’t obvious at first—just a flicker, like the snow on the screen was shifting in a way it shouldn’t. I’d catch it out of the corner of my eye while typing, a subtle ripple that made the static look… organized. Like it was trying to form a shape. I’d turn to look, and it’d be gone, just random noise again. I figured it was my imagination, or maybe the TV was glitching. Old tech, right? Bound to act up.



But it kept happening. Every night, around 1 or 2 a.m., the static would change. I started watching it on purpose, staring into the screen, trying to catch the moment it shifted. And then, one night, I saw it clearly. The snow parted, just for a second, and there was a pattern—spirals within spirals, twisting inward like a tunnel. It wasn’t just on the screen. It felt like it was *behind* the screen, like I was looking through a window into something vast. My head throbbed, and my ears rang with a low, droning hum that wasn’t coming from the TV. I blinked, and the static was back, hissing like nothing had happened.

  
I unplugged the TV that night, told myself it was just late, that I was tired. But I couldn’t sleep. The pattern was burned into my mind, those endless spirals spinning in the dark behind my eyelids. The next day, I tried to work, but I kept glancing at the TV, sitting silent in the corner. I swore I could hear it humming, even unplugged. By nightfall, I couldn’t stand it anymore. I plugged it back in, turned it on, and tuned to the dead channel.

  
The pattern was there immediately. No flicker, no hesitation. The static swirled into spirals, tighter and deeper than before, pulling my eyes toward the center. The hum was louder now, vibrating in my chest, and I felt a pressure in my skull, like something was pressing against my thoughts. I couldn’t look away. The spirals moved, not like a video, but like something alive, coiling and uncoiling in a space that wasn’t here. And then I heard it—a whisper, not in words, but in my mind. It wasn’t speaking to me. It was speaking *through* me, like I was a receiver for something else.

  
I don’t know how long I sat there. Hours, maybe. When I finally tore my eyes away, my nose was bleeding, and my laptop was open to a blank document filled with rows of numbers I didn’t remember typing. They weren’t random—each row was a sequence, repeating and folding into itself, like a code I couldn’t crack but felt I should understand. The TV was still on, the pattern pulsing, and I swear it was watching me. Not the screen, but whatever was behind it.

  
I smashed the TV the next morning. Took a hammer to it, shattered the glass, ripped out the tubes. The apartment reeked of ozone and dust, but the hum didn’t stop. It was in my head now, constant, like a heartbeat I couldn’t escape. The pattern followed me too. I’d see it in the grain of the wooden floor, in the texture of the walls, in the way the light flickered through my blinds. It was everywhere, hiding in plain sight, and every time I saw it, that whisper came back, louder, clearer. It wasn’t words, but it was a *question*. Not “who are you?” or “what do you want?” but something deeper, something that made my skin crawl and my thoughts unravel. It was asking what I *was*, like it didn’t believe I belonged here.

  
I stopped going outside. The pattern was out there too—in the clouds, in the cracks of the sidewalk, in the reflections on car windows. I started seeing it in people’s faces, their eyes spiraling inward when they looked at me too long. My neighbor knocked on my door one day, asked if I was okay. I couldn’t answer. His voice sounded like the hum, and his smile was wrong, like he was part of it now. I slammed the door and haven’t opened it since.



I’m writing this on my phone because my laptop’s screen started showing the pattern too, even when it’s off. The battery’s dying, and I’m scared to charge it. The hum is so loud now it drowns out everything else, and the whispers are constant, overlapping, like a chorus of things that aren’t human. I don’t sleep anymore. When I try, I dream of a place that’s not a place—a void where the pattern is everything, stretching forever, and something moves in it. Not a body, not a shape, but a *mind*. It’s old, older than anything, and it’s curious. It’s peeling me apart, layer by layer, to see what’s inside.

  
I found a mirror in my bathroom yesterday. I don’t remember owning one. When I looked in it, my reflection wasn’t right. My eyes were spirals, my skin was static, and my mouth moved without me, whispering numbers. I broke the mirror, but the shards still show the pattern, glinting in the dark.



I don’t know what it wants. I don’t think it *wants* anything, not the way we do. It’s just… aware of me now, and that’s enough. I can feel it rewriting me, turning my thoughts into its thoughts, my memories into its memories. I’m not sure how much of me is left. If you’re reading this, don’t look for the pattern. Don’t stare at static, don’t watch the shadows too long, don’t listen to the hum. It’s not random. It’s a signal, and it’s been waiting for someone to notice.

  
I’m going to post this and then—God, I don’t know. The hum’s so loud now. The pattern’s in my hands as I type, in the words on the screen, in the air I’m breathing. It’s here. It’s always been here.

I’m sorry.
