“Carson?” My wife's voice echoed from the kitchen, tinged with a desperate hope. I had just stepped through the door, weary from another day spent searching the endless rows of corn. It had been three years since our son vanished, and although the police had long since given up, I couldn't. Each day I scoured the fields, driven more by the need to preserve what little sanity Abigail had left than by hope of finding Carson.

“No, honey, it’s just me. Still no sign of our boy,” I replied, hanging up my coat and entering the kitchen, where she had set out three plates—hers, mine, and the ever-present one for Carson. “It’s getting awfully late; he should be home by now,” she murmured, pouring lemonade with shaking hands.

I sat down at the kitchen table, feeling the weight of isolation. My wife, lost in her denial, clung to the belief that Carson would walk through the door at any moment. The toll was evident; her spirit, like her body, seemed to wither with each passing day.

“If he’s not back by morning, can you go out and look again?” she asked, her voice hollow, her eyes devoid of life. I nodded mechanically, "Yes love, I’ll go out again," though each affirmation felt heavier than the last.

Rising to clear my plate, I felt her hand grip my wrist with startling strength. Her skin was cold, her fingers clamped like iron. She looked up at me, her face gaunt, her eyes hollow. Her breath, smelling of decay, brushed against my ear as she whispered hoarsely, "Find him, find our baby boy."

I awoke with a start, gasping for air, my heart racing. The nightmare had felt so real, a vivid horror that lingered in the dim morning light. The sun, unmoving, cast the same shadows across my room, mocking the passage of time. Despite the intensity of the dream, my body felt strangely unburdened by hunger. I forced down a granola bar and some water, then prepared to face the path once more.

The familiar stretch of concrete, bordered by endless corn, initially seemed normal. Yet as I walked, each bizarre encounter deepened the mystery of this path. What had Carson found here?

Driven by a blend of fear and necessity, I resolved to fulfill my wife's dying wish. With each step, the eerie sensation of being watched grew stronger. I frequently glanced over my shoulder, half-expecting to catch a glimpse of whatever might be lurking behind. The path stretched endlessly before me, each cornstalk seeming to whisper secrets I was yet to understand.

Or if I was just being paranoid. My mind darted back to the creature from that neighborhood and wondered if it had been following me ever since, playing cruel games. But there was something else out there. I heard it—faint but distinct—a crunching sound off to my right every time I moved. When I stopped to listen, it mirrored my actions and fell silent too. I quickened my pace and, unmistakably, it kept up with me.

As I pushed forward, the haunting words of the entity echoed in my mind, a reminder of the ominous rules laid before me. Gradually, the corn gave way to a dense fog. After a few turns, military helmets began to appear in the dirt, half-buried, one marked by an Ace of Spades strapped to it. A shiver ran through me as memories of war horrors flooded back. Guns protruded from the ground alongside gear and backpacks; a charred helicopter was visible through the thinning stalks of corn. The heat from its wreckage seemed to wither the corn further until, after one final turn, the landscape shifted dramatically. I found myself in a forest, the trees tall and skinny with thick underbrush—a perfect replica of Vietnam.

I was in a carbon copy of the jungle where I had fought, a place that had haunted my dreams for years. My reverie was interrupted by distant voices—familiar yet impossible. They were the voices of my platoon. Instinctively, I wanted to turn and flee, but the path that had led me here was gone, swallowed by the relentless forest.

“John?” The call came from a voice etched deep in my memory. My heart clenched at the sound, tears welling up as the reality of hearing that voice again hit me. I spun around and there he was—my best friend Will, standing nonchalantly on the concrete path as if it perfectly belonged in the dense jungle. We had been drafted together, believing ourselves invincible, atop the world. Yet, he had never made it back. The sight of his mother weeping for her lost son was a nightmare reawakened by his presence. “What are you doing over there, man? Taking a piss?” he chuckled, his voice breaking through the eerie silence.

The rest of the platoon, their expressions blank and emotionless, stood forming a barricade across the path. In unison, they waved their hands and called out, “Come on, let's keep moving, John!” Their voices were cheerful, but their faces were void of any feeling, a chilling contrast that underscored the surreal horror of the moment.

They continued, but Will remained. I rushed over, seizing his straps, panic tightening my voice as I shouted, "Will, WILL! LISTEN TO ME! YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!" I shook him violently, trying to snap him back to reality. Just as he opened his mouth to respond, an explosion erupted nearby. The group that had been jovially chatting was now screaming in agony; gunshots and bullets whizzed past us. I pulled Will behind a massive tree that lined the path. "WILL, YOU HAVE TO COME WITH ME! YOU'RE GOING TO DIE HERE!" I yelled over the cacophony of our platoon's screams, the relentless gunshots, and the booming explosions.

Will's demeanor remained eerily calm, a stark contrast to the chaos around us. He chuckled, a sound twisted with bitterness. "Now you want to save me? You left me to get shot, my guts spilling out, me trying to shove them back in? You looked at me, knew I was a goner, and ran, didn't you? Ran like a coward!" His voice was thick with accusation and malice.

"NO, WILL, JESUS, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED! JUST COME WITH ME, WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE!" I pleaded, momentarily forgetting that I was still trapped in this twisted game, still on that infernal path. I thought I could save Will, redeem myself, and end the survivor's guilt that had haunted me.

Then, suddenly, every sound ceased. An oppressive silence enveloped us. Will's whisper sliced through the quiet, clear and chilling, "Do you think you can save a dead man?" Tears welled in my eyes, transforming into pure fear as I watched him transform. His eyes rolled back, his mouth stretched wider and wider into an impossible grimace.

As I stumbled backward, Will’s body began to contort violently, grotesquely—the sounds of tearing muscles and snapping bones resonating through the still forest. His limbs twisted and reconfigured with jarring snaps. What once was Will was now a monstrosity on all fours, his torso and head inverted, hair brushing the forest floor, his face frozen in an eternal scream. His legs, however, stretched out unnaturally, feet planted on the ground.

It turned its head towards me, then started skulking forward. I scrambled back, my heart hammering, as the horror of seeing my best friend morph into a nightmare unfolded. Its movements were jerky and erratic, matching the terror that gripped me. A disturbing clicking noise emanated from it as I forced myself to my feet and sprinted away, sticking to the path, the only lifeline I had.

I didn't look back; the thing was now leaping from tree to tree, a predator in the canopy. My breath grew harsh and ragged, mirroring the thing’s frantic movements. The jungle seemed endless, the path winding onward without respite. Suddenly, I heard it crash to the ground behind me. Terrified to look, I pressed on until I saw the path veer sharply right. Rounding the corner, the familiar rows of corn reappeared, and just like that, the sounds of my pursuer vanished, swallowed by the maze of stalks that once again surrounded me.

I kept running until my sprint slowed to a jog, and then a weary walk. For the first time since that nightmarish encounter, I turned around. Behind me stretched nothing but corn and the path leading back to where I'd come from. I stopped to catch my breath and pulled out a bottle of water. Surprisingly, I didn't need much to quench my thirst—a curious fact that made me wonder if this, too was part of the path's machinations, a sinister game designed to keep me alive and pushing forward. Despite not expecting to be out here this long, I couldn't help but feel a twisted gratitude for the sustenance.

As I resumed walking, thoughts of my son haunted me, replaying a gruesome possibility over and over: What if he hadn't survived? What if that entity was holding him captive in this hellish limbo? The crunching sound that I had come to dread soon filled the silence again, but this time it grew louder, closer. I spun around, and from the corn stalks emerged a figure, so familiar yet so out of place that it punched the air from my lungs. "Abby!?" I called out, my voice cracking with a mix of hope and terror.

She stumbled forward, barely able to walk, her appearance as ghastly as it had been in my nightmare. Her skin was cracked and aged, hairless, and covered in dirt. "Abigail?" I reached out, grasping her hands. She responded with nothing but a low moan, deepening the pit in my stomach. I swallowed hard, convincing myself she wasn't real, and forced myself to continue walking. Yet, she followed me, a ghostly echo of my past shadowing my every step.

Glancing over my shoulder periodically confirmed she was still there—a spectral reminder of what I'd lost and what haunted me still. The path seemed to be playing tricks, hastening my mental and emotional decay with each step. Her presence, so familiar yet grotesquely altered, acted like a distorted mirror reflecting my own internal disintegration.

The line between nightmare and reality blurred with every step. Her faint groans were soft and strained, a heart-wrenching soundtrack to our macabre march. Despite all the horrors I had witnessed and fled from on this path, this slow procession with the decayed semblance of my wife was by far the most torturous. I stopped several times, yelling into the void for her to leave me alone, my shouts dissipating into the eerie calm punctuated only by the whisper of the wind through the corn.

She mirrored my stops, staring silently whenever I turned to confront her. Exhaustion overtook me, and I took breaks more frequently, each time trying to ignore her presence. Now, the path offered no distorted houses or flashbacks, just her, the corn, me, and the relentless path forward. I trudged on for what felt like hours, perhaps days, driven by a weary desperation, the specter of my wife a constant, unnerving companion keeping me painfully awake.

As I grew accustomed to the spectral presence at my side, she began to murmur under her breath. At first, the words were just a whisper, too soft to make out. But as we walked, her voice grew clearer, imbued with the unmistakable tone of Abby's—a voice laced with despair and mourning. "It’s sick... terribly sick. It was supposed to heal, but now it's infested, corrupted, decaying from within," she mumbled, her speech disjointed and heavy with sorrow. With each step, she drew closer, her form a blur yet hauntingly familiar, until she was just inches away. The sight of her cracked, weathered skin, hairless scalp, eyes hollow and lost—was a stark and harrowing reminder of what had been lost.

"Yes, you were sick, but you're gone now. I know you're just another trick, part of the game," I declared, turning my head to mask the tear that trickled down my cheek. Yet, as I gathered myself to move on, her voice, soft but urgent, caressed my ear. "John," she whispered, her breath chilling against my skin, "one final challenge remains. Do not look back, do not stray from the path. I know you're scared, but you must continue. Do it for me, bring him back. But please, John, be cautious."

Her words hung in the air as her form started to dissipate, turning into a few wisps of ash that transformed into blue butterflies and fluttered away. Collapsing under the weight of this spectral goodbye, I was overwhelmed by the profound sense of loss, her last words echoing in my heart. I lay there until dusk, wrestling with the gravity of her warning and the daunting journey ahead.

As dawn painted the sky with strokes of soft light, I rose and resumed my journey, sustained by nothing more than a granola bar and some water. The path at first offered a tranquil respite, with only the wind's whisper and the unchanged, radiant sky above to comfort me. But this peace was short-lived as a foul stench soon began to suffocate the air, intensifying with each step I took. It was an indescribable smell of decay, the kind that seeps into your clothes, clings to the back of your throat, and heralds the imminence of death.

A distant, deep red peak drew my gaze, its edges seeming to twitch subtly against the horizon. As I approached, the air thickened with an acrid stench that clung to the back of my throat. The outline, initially indistinct, slowly resolved into a more defined form, though not clear enough to fully discern its nature. It seemed to pulsate gently, an unsettling rhythm that suggested something unnatural, less like a structure and more like a silent beacon of dread.

Each hesitant step brought me closer to the base, where a living structure writhed in what seemed like agony. From afar, its movements suggested a sinister, undulating life force, but as I neared, the details emerged in grotesque clarity. Silent screams echoed from contorted visages of flesh, each pulsation drawing me deeper into a core of dark despair.

Upon reaching the base, the true composition of the pyramid revealed itself—a ghastly mosaic of human flesh, bones, and body parts, all entwined in a dance of decay. The mass seemed to breathe, arms and feet wriggling grotesquely as if to beckon me closer. Among the horror, an eyeball lodged within the structure blinked, sending a shiver down my spine. Overwhelmed with revulsion, I collapsed beside the macabre edifice, my stomach turning as I retched from the overwhelming sight.

There was no conceivable way I could enter, I thought. The reality I'd left behind seemed like a distant memory, and this—this abomination—was beyond anything I could have fathomed. I considered turning back, breaking the ominous rules of this twisted path and accepting whatever dire fate awaited as a consequence. Just then, a blue butterfly fluttered overhead and disappeared into the cornfield, reminding me of why I had ventured so far into this nightmare. I had witnessed horrors, yes, but I couldn't give up, not now.

With a deep, steadying breath, I stood and approached the gaping maw of the pyramid's entrance. The interior was cloaked in darkness, and as the light from the tunnel faded, I clicked on my flashlight, resolved to keep my gaze fixed to the path beneath my feet, avoiding the nightmarish walls around me. The corridor was narrow, the air thick with the sounds of snapping bones and the undulations of flesh.

Trying desperately to distract myself, I recalled memories of my wife and son—the happiness we had shared. But the walls seemed to close in with every step, fleshy appendages reaching out in a grotesque attempt to pull me into their mass. The path ended abruptly, the ground before me as flesh-ridden as the walls, eyes blinking up at me, some shedding tears. Mouths moaned in pain and fear, their cries echoing around me.

As I crouched lower, hands reached out, pulling at my clothing and skin, their touch flimsy yet persistent. I stumbled and fell forward onto the soft, repulsive mass. A mouth near my face grinned maliciously, and then, as if to cut through the cacophony of horror, a chilling voice hissed, "Join us, John! Join us!" Both a scream and a whisper, it paralyzed me momentarily.

Crawling forward became a struggle for survival as the walls tightened further, squeezing against me. I had to inhale sharply just to make the smallest progress. Frantic, I encountered a barrier—a wall of dirt. Clawing at it, I realized there was no way through. Hands from the flesh wall grabbed at me, pulling me backward. My heartbeat thundered in my ears as I dug my hands into the mass, anchoring myself against the pull, the warmth of blood mingling with the dirt under my fingernails.

Each movement was a battle against the physical manifestations of my darkest fears, the path a literal throat of horror closing in on me. As the hands clawed and the mouths bit, I fought with every ounce of strength left in my body, pushing forward through the visceral barrier that sought to consume me.

I pushed forward relentlessly, clawing at the dirt with desperate fervor, my fingers scrabbling like a dog's. Light began to seep through the cracks, bolstering my dwindling adrenaline. With a final, frenzied effort that seemed to shift gravity itself, I burst through, tumbling onto the grass. I scooted back from the hole as the muffled cries from within faded into silence. Exhausted, I lay there, gazing up at the drifting clouds, letting hours slip by as the sun began to set.

Around me, the familiar sights of home slowly came into focus. I lay there, not with a burst of joy, but overwhelmed by a profound need for normalcy—a hot shower and the comfort of my own bed. After cleaning up, I collapsed into sleep, the softness of my mattress a stark contrast to the hard concrete that had been my bed on that hellish path. That night, I slept dreamlessly, enjoying the deepest rest I'd had in years.

The next morning, as I sipped coffee, I gazed out the window. My skin bore no marks of the ordeal, leading me to wonder about the reality of it all. How would Carson return, if at all? Was it all a massive, harrowing delusion? My contemplation was abruptly shattered by the sound of a baby crying outside my door. Confusion and dread mounted as I set my coffee down and approached the door, half-expecting to confront another monstrous remnant from the path.

Peeking outside, I was stunned to find a brown woven basket on my doorstep, holding a crying baby wrapped snugly in a blanket. As I opened the door fully, a wave of recognition washed over me—it was Carson, unmistakably, with the same chin as mine, a newborn mirroring the day he first came into the world.

Overwhelmed, I dropped to my knees, tears mingling with relief and joy as I lifted him into my arms. I spent the day enveloped in the simple acts of caring for him, the horrors of the path receding into a distant nightmare. As night fell and I prepared him for bed, laying beside him, the peace of that moment felt like the closing of a profound, terrifying chapter. It was the last day I knew such pure, unshadowed happiness.

I awoke to Carson's crying; it was deeper now, no longer the wail of a newborn but that of a toddler. Groggy and dazed, I remembered all too well the trials of nighttime parenting. Wincing at the thought, I turned on the lamp and was struck by an immediate, sinking horror. The world seemed to crash down around me as I saw him: Carson had grown. His legs had burst through the diaper and onesie, dangling over the edge of the basket. He appeared to be about a year old.

Words fail to capture the sheer terror of watching my son age a year with each passing day. He never spoke, and while he learned to walk, it was with great difficulty. He communicated only in grunts and moans, devoid of any real life or vitality. Day by day, I watched helplessly as he aged rapidly before my eyes.

On day 21, I observed the features that he might have developed had he not disappeared. One sleepless night, driven by a morbid curiosity, I watched him during the haunting transition from day 29 to day 30 at exactly 4:05 AM. His eyes flew open abruptly, and his expression contorted in agony. Subtle but rapid changes occurred, his features matured slightly, his hair thickened, and his body twitched as if enduring a sudden growth spurt, causing him visible discomfort. He gasped, a guttural sound of distress escaping him, then fell back into a fitful, restless sleep. I vowed never to witness such horror again. 

By day 45, he could stand and shuffle about aimlessly, yet he remained largely unresponsive, like a ghost haunting his own body. Each day brought more pain than the last, watching him age beyond me, becoming frailer with each passing moment.

Day 82 found him bedridden, his body failing. The aging never stopped. By day 165, I realized the terrible truth: he was cursed. A decision no parent should ever have to make became my only recourse. With a heavy heart and tears streaming down my face, I ended his suffering, smothering him with a pillow. His weak body offered no resistance.

I cremated him afterward, spreading his ashes across the farm. That night, a low, mocking laugh echoed from the cornfields, the same damn path that cursed my son. I swore to find it and destroy it.

That was many, many years ago. I've spent decades searching for the path again, calling out into the void of the cornfields, but to no avail. I've tried everything, researching the land's ownership and setting fires, but nothing has brought it back, and nothing has been destroyed. Now an old man, my body wracked with pain, I write this in the hope that my story will serve as a warning.

Tonight, I will make one final journey into the corn. I don't plan on coming back.
