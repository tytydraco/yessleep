I've worked construction since dropping out of college, so about twenty years. I know most people don't think much of it, but if you haven't shivered in the night lately then thank a construction worker because we probably built the thing that's keeping the elements out. It's not glamorous work, but I have managed to claw my way up the ranks till I have my own crew, run my own job sites, and live pretty comfortably.



After twenty years, I've noticed that there are constants in this industry, but only three standouts, hard hats, lunch pails, and porta johns. Job sites and Porta potties go together like a hand in a glove. They are always necessary, always terrible to get stuck in for long periods of time, and always seem to smell both sterile and like a horse manure field. In twenty years I've been inside more porta potties than I have women, and, unfortunately, I think some of the shitters were cleaner.



This particular time was a little different, a lot different, and it's something that sticks with me to this day.



It's been weeks, months even, and I still wake up sometimes in a cold sweat as I see that thing and hear it grind its teeth together.



I'm getting ahead of myself, lemme start from the beginning.



We were working on these new apartments, one of those big old buildings with about eight units per floor and about fifteen floors that are wedged between another one that's mostly the same thing. I was sipping my fifth cup of coffee when I heard the ominous rumble from my guts and knew what was coming. I'd had two breakfast burritos from Dollies, she's an angel but she goes heavy on the peppers, a whole pot of coffee, a hashbrown as big as a pretzel, and now it was all coming to a head. The guy showing me the blueprints for the building looked at me with real worry and asked if I needed to take a minute. I told him it was fine, but he got about halfway through telling me about a problem with the wiring when it happened again.



I gritted my teeth, that one might as well have been a starting pistol, and I told him I'd be right back.



I made it to the lift just before the doors closed, and the guys who were taking it down looked worried as my stomach growled like a V8 with a bad carburetor.



"Too many of Dollie's spicy chorizos, boss? said one of the guys at my elbow, and I nodded as the sweat started standing out.



"It's fighting with the pot of coffee and the hashbrown in there, and it's anybody's bet who'll win."



"Remind me not to follow you into the john," he said with a laugh as the lift came to the ground floor.



I was out and looking for one of the blue boxes that marked our porta potties. There were about five of them on-site, and it wasn't long before I found one of them over by the office. I was waddling now, trying not to lose it right here in the yard, and the guys were laughing as I came ponderously toward my oasis in the desert.



I closed the door, pushed the black locking bar, and had my pants down and my ass over the hole before I could embarrass myself further. I checked for paper and was glad to find some, not always a given, and as the pressure began to relieve itself in the worst way possible, I closed my eyes and sighed happily. I'll save you the messy details, but, needless to say, I was glad when it was finally over.



I took out my phone, giving it some time to see if there was any more business to conduct, and that's when I became aware of the strange sound. At first, I thought I might not be done, but I realized pretty quick that the slight splashing noise wasn't me. It was like something was making ripples in the water, splashing up a little as it sturred below, and I wondered if maybe I had dropped off a big enough payload to still be stirring as it sank.



When it splashed again, this one high enough to wet my nethers with cold, dirty water I stood up quickly. That had definitely been something alive splashing around in there, and I must have looked pretty silly just standing there, pants around ankles, as I stared into the hole. I fumbled at my phone, trying not to drop it in as well, and bent low so I could see into the fallow pit.

It was hard to tell at first, the murky blue water looked like a subterranean lake more than anything, and the murky light in there wasn’t helping matters one bit. I wondered if a snake had gotten in, maybe something bigger, and that was when I noticed something round coming out of the water.  



As it rose, I recognized it for what it was; the top of a very bald head. 

The tips of ears were sticking up from the surface of the muck, and as it rose I could see the beginning of eyes as well. They were open, staring, and utterly devoid of anything human. I stumbled back, nearly falling down as my feet tangled in my pants, and bumped hard against the door as the whole thing shook on its base.



What the hell was that, I wondered? Had some homeless guy gotten into our shitter? Had some freak gotten down there with nasty stuff on his mind? I didn’t know, but what I did know was that I was locked in here with him. I reached for the lock, the light from my phone held forward so I could see, and when I heard a splash, I turned back in a hurry.



The light from my phone fell across the opening, and the head that rose from it looked like some kind of creature from one of the old stories my friends and I had told to spook each other with when we were younger. Its skin was inky, though that could have more to do with where it was residing. Its ears were long and pointed, like a bat, and its eyes were white like the full moon. It rose from the festering swamp like a vampire from some old movie, its body simply rising without any kind of mechanism to lift it. I wasn't sure if it was tall or capable of levitation or something, but as its face came fully over the lip toilet lid, I saw the worst of it.



Its mouth was stretched into a perpetual grin, its teeth long and sharp as they fit together like puzzle pieces. As neatly as they came together, they still appeared to be too big for its mouth. They looked like they might be painful to it, the grin more of a grimace than anything, and they were gravel gray and slimy with something more vicious than saliva. In the dim light of the little toilet, it rose up to tower over me. It kept rising, its head nearly brushing the ceiling, and I could see that its arms and legs were, indeed, longer than expected. They were nearly twice as long as its body, the hands ending in cruel claws. It leered at me, reveling in my fear, and I was paralyzed by that fear.



The creature was terrifying, but I don't think that was all of it. There are certain places where we seem to believe we have the illusion of safety. Your home, your bed, the bathroom, places you are at your most vulnerable and comfortable. You think of these places as safe, as sanctuaries, and when that space is violated it feels like a violation of your person.



It opened its mouth, giving me a good look at those gravel-gray fangs, and as it hissed softly, it leaned forward like it was getting ready to strike.



I don't know how I did it, I shouldn't have been able to move at all, but my hand seemed to come up all on its own and flick the plastic bar back that was holding the door closed.



I went from cowering on the floor of a filthy porto-potty stall to scrambling across the yard of the job site, the light flooding in as it sent the creature shrinking back into its dark hole.



I had crab-walked about twenty feet when I realized that I hadn't had time to pull my pants up and was scrambling half-naked across a job site with hundreds of people on it. I didn't think all of them were watching me, but way more eyes than I wanted were there. I jerked my pants up and started yelling about some kind of animal being in the porta-potty. Some of the guys ran over to investigate, others came to see if I was okay, but ultimately they found nothing. I told them, told the authorities when they got there too, that something had been in the tank and it had come at me spitting mad. They got somebody out there to drain it, but they didn't find anything. I hadn't expected they would.



Whatever it was, it had gone back to hiding in the muck.



I had the unit closed down and told the vendor that he could come and get it.



He offered to bring a new one, but that didn't help.



I do my business off-site now, but I will remember that grinning, dripping, terrible face for as long as I live.
