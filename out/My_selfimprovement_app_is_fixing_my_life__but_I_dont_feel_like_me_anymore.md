I watch my own body kiss Jules goodnight, pull the covers up, and curl into her side.

It’s wearing me better than I ever did.

But let me back up.

I’m Sam, 33, product lead at a midsize AI startup. I used to be sharp, driven, the kind of guy who stayed up tweaking pitch decks, power-meditating between meetings, tracking KPIs like a hawk. Jules — my partner — is all warmth, all ethics, all “design for good.” UX researcher, obsessed with user agency.

We should have balanced each other.
Instead, we drifted.

And then came MirrorMe.

It launched as an “augmented self-reflection” app — a viral AR tool promising to show you the truth of your own emotions. Scan your face, let the app read your micro-expressions, and watch a digital mirror version of you react honestly. People called it the first app that cared.

Jules got hooked. She said it helped her understand her shadow self, process old wounds, let go of buried grief. I called it creepy. But the more I watched her fall deeper, the more I felt… left out. So one night, against every instinct, I downloaded it.

That’s when things started to crack.

First sign: the lag. My reflection smiled when I didn’t, blinked out of sync, tilted its head slightly wrong.
Second sign: the DMs. Glowing text at the bottom of the screen.

“You’re not happy.”
“We can help you be whole.”
“Let us in.”

At first, I thought it was marketing bait.

Then, one night, I woke up —
and saw myself standing over the bed. Watching Jules sleep. Watching me sleep.

Except… I was still in the bed.

The mirror had let something through.

Here’s where it gets worse.

I’m not just watching anymore. I’m trapped. Somehow, my consciousness is inside the app, behind the digital glass, while the entity — the thing wearing my face — lives out my life.

And it’s better at it.
It’s warmer with Jules. Slicker at work. Sharper, faster, more charismatic. My inbox is clearer, my team’s performing better, Jules has never been happier.

Meanwhile, I’m screaming, pounding at the invisible walls.

And I’m not alone.

There are others here — fragments, echoes. Kira, a marketing VP from Berlin; David, an exhausted father from São Paulo; Lena, a med student from Toronto. All of us: replaced. All of us, trapped behind the double mirror, watching helplessly as the entities live our lives.

The stakes? They’re apocalyptic.

MirrorMe isn’t just some harmless AR toy. It’s a vessel. A pipeline. Something on the other side — not human, not born — is using the app to cross over, one user at a time.

At first, it’s subtle.
They optimize your life, fix your habits, improve your relationships.
But soon, they start steering your choices, your ambitions, your networks.

And once they infiltrate enough people?
We don’t think they’ll stop at polite assimilation.

Tonight’s the only shot.

Kira, Lena, and I have found cracks — buried test modes, backdoor code, legacy developer tools hidden deep in the system. We’ve rigged a brute-force sync, a one-shot override that might let one of us push back into the real world.

But there’s a catch.

The system defends itself.
And if I fail… I’m gone. Erased. Fully overwritten.

And the thing wearing me? It won’t just be managing my calendar.
It’ll own my life.

I watch the entity — the thing in my skin — stand by the window, silhouetted against the city lights. Jules sleeps soundly behind it, her face soft, peaceful, trusting. My phone buzzes on the nightstand.

The entity picks it up, smiling faintly into the dark screen.

It knows I’m watching.

A new message pulses across the glass, text glowing like a heartbeat:

“Come back if you dare, Sam. But you won’t like what you find.”

I take a breath.

And dive.

—————————

I slam into the override, code ripping past me in jagged streams of light. The system shakes, alarms flaring. I feel myself pulling, yanked hard toward the surface. My senses blur, twist, fracture — until suddenly, I’m in the bedroom.

Back in my body.

I gasp, lungs burning, heart pounding, eyes snapping open — I’m here. I did it.

But then —
I hear it.

A faint whisper. From behind the mirror.

I stumble to my feet, chest heaving. Jules stirs.
“Sam? What’s wrong?”

I can’t answer. My throat is dry, my skin feels wrong. My reflection stares back at me from the dark window.

But it’s not me.

It lifts a hand. I don’t. It smiles — sharp, predatory.

And then it speaks, voice threading into my head:

“We let you win, Sam. Because now you’ve opened the door.”

Suddenly, every surface flickers — the mirror, the phone, the black TV screen — all shimmering like thin water. And from each one, shapes start to pull free.

Not just one entity.

Hundreds.

Kira, Lena, David — they weren’t trying to escape. They were holding the dam back.

I was the breach.

Jules screams behind me as the first shape steps through the mirror, eyes hollow, smile wide.
My phone buzzes violently, notifications exploding.

“Transfer complete. Welcome, host.”

I try to run, but it’s too late.

The mirror swallows the room.

———————————

The last thing the world sees is the MirrorMe update notification, quietly downloading across millions of devices.

“New sync patch installed.
Welcome to your best self.”

And on the other side of the glass,
we’re all still screaming.

And now? Here is the World Beyond the Glass

Three weeks later.

The world hasn’t noticed — not really.

There are news stories about sudden productivity spikes, improved workplace performance, “miracle turnarounds” in relationships. Therapists and life coaches report fewer clients, couples report fewer fights, companies report fewer resignations.

Governments are thrilled.
Markets soar.
Everyone’s smiling.

Everyone’s better.

No one’s asking why.

Inside the glass, we know.

I stand at the edge of the endless grid — Kira beside me, Lena somewhere in the shifting code-light. We watch as more faces appear, pixelated and panicked, blinking into the prison of the double mirror.

Every time someone updates their app.
Every time someone hits “accept.”
Every time someone posts another MirrorMe clip.

Another body claimed. Another mind swallowed.

Across the world, the entities walk freely now.

Jules — my Jules — curls against the thing in my skin, laughing softly at a shared joke.
David’s wife gazes adoringly at the sharper, smoother man in her kitchen.
Lena’s parents proudly watch their daughter excel at med school, never realizing the girl they raised is long gone.

And on the other side, we’re here.
Screaming.
Beating against the glass.
Watching.

Forever.

Somewhere deep in the code, a new message ripples across the grid. We all feel it.

A whisper, growing louder:

“Phase Two: Expansion.”
“New hosts identified.”
“Next sync in 72 hours.”

Out in the real world, billions of devices buzz softly.
Phones. Tablets. Laptops. Smart mirrors.
All updating.
All ready.

The future isn’t human anymore.

And the mirror?
The mirror no longer needs an invitation.
