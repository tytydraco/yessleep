i've been in a daze for a while now. i can't tell when it started or how long i've been here. i stopped keeping track; i can barely keep time anymore. been looking for a way out for what feels like months now. i'm out of ideas.

this place is pretty much the same one i came from. bits and pieces of it look like home, just obscured in some unnatural way i can't put my finger on. things go on as normal, people live their lives with others, nothing special. that's exactly what terrifies me about it.

there's something itching at the back of my skull that tells me that something's off. i don't belong here. everyone knows it, but no one will say anything. i feel eyes from all over the place, like i'm a human alien. i thought i knew the way back, but it took me even deeper. i have no idea what i'm doing anymore. my brain feels like mush, like there's a heavy fog inside my skull that i just can't get past.

i'm not safe here, and i can never leave.

certain details in this world are impossible for me to make out. there are signs with written words that everyone else can understand, but somehow i can't even wrap my mind around it all. streets are flipped backwards, maps are impossible to decipher. my phone doesn't even work here, i can't even get a signal. i feel so lost.

i've had to sleep in abandoned buildings and steal from grocery stores just to survive. not like i have much of an appetite anymore, or an ability to sleep for that matter. there's always this everpresent sense of danger here that i can't escape from. i close my eyes and i hear voices taunting me, reminding me of my worst fears, threatening to do horrible things to me or convincing me to do those things to myself. i don't have the drive to sleep anymore. i just keep trying to piece together what led me here, just to keep myself somewhat sane.

the last moment i remember from my previous life was coming home after a long day at work. i felt like shit that day. the manual labor job i did to barely make rent was killing me. i remember my whole body aching by the time i got home. i remember taking a shower, standing under the hot water and replaying all the events from that day in my head. as the warm water ran over the back of my head, onto the sore bones and pulled muscles around my body, all the stupid mistakes i made were flashing before my eyes when i closed them. all of which seem inconsequential now. i can't even remember what i was so upset about back then. i don't think it even matters. maybe it never did. whatever...

i remember getting out of the shower, drying off with a towel, and putting my clothes on. i remember going to the mirror and wiping all the fog from it. i went to put deodorant on, brush my teeth, do all the normal nighttime things. i took some pain meds to help with all the soreness my body had collected from the day. i felt a sickness coming on, unsure if i caught a bug or just felt the collapse of all this long work and lack of sleep catching up to me, so i took some allergy meds to try and nip it in the bud.

i vaguely remember thinking of something this girl i worked with said about me. i had heard it through another coworker of mine, and it really upset me. i can't remember what it was anymore, but i know it left a really deep impact. she was someone i had real loving feelings for, but couldn't express myself properly at the time. i think i came across way worse than i had meant to, and i felt awful about it. she got the worst impression of me ever. i felt like such a coward for how i dealt with the whole situation. i remember wishing i could see her again, just to set the record straight between us. even still, i felt like i could never face her anymore. her image kept entering my mind, and i could no longer tell if it was a reminder or a punishment.

every day that i'm stuck here, my mind feels like it unravels more and more. it feels like the fog in my skull is starting to extend out onto the world, or at least into my vision. everything looks and feels hazy and disjointed. i'll close my eyes and suddenly transport to another place, without the memory of how i even got there. sometimes i'll look down at my hands moving and see light trails emanating from them. the way time and space operate here is insane.

i started to feel more of a sinister presence in the crowds of people i aimlessly trudge my way around. everyone seems like they have this faint dark aura around them, like something just outside of their form is stealing all the light around them. sometimes i'll hear those voices reappear all around me in a subdued way, like everyone is talking behind my back, whispering jokes and insults at my expense, telling me i'm a waste of life. i'll feel those stark, evil stares all around my person more and more until everyone eventually disappears into their comfortable homes. i'll eventually find another place to sit down, try to get some sort of rest. and every night, the voices get louder, more menacing, more dangerous. i'll open my eyes and no one is there. just a thick malaise over everything.

my mind is starting to fail me. i need to get out of here. how did i get here? shake off the voices. think...

i had spit out my toothpaste and washed my hands in the sink, before looking back up at the mirror. the fog was clearing up a bit from the fan being on, but it still clung to the edges like a vignette. the only thing i could see clearly was my ugly, awful likeness reflected back at me. i remember gazing at the small details in my reflection's face, pointing out all the hideous details back to myself. the recession pattern in my hair that made me look like i was sporting a combover in a futile attempt to hide the obvious. all the wrinkles in my face deeper than they should be for my age, highlighting all the stress and exhaustion i've been under. all the yellow pigment collecting on my teeth from coffee and cigarettes. the uneven nature of my eyes and facial details, looking more and more awkward and distorted as i studied it all. my gaze fell deeper and deeper into all the details, everything around me just fading in the background. i remember...

i woke up again. but this time i didn't really feel like i was awake. my eyes still felt shut. matter of fact, my whole body wouldn't move. it was like i was in a straight jacket, struggling to get any of my limbs moving. as i looked forward with my mind's eye, where my reflection was a moment ago loomed a dark, shadowy figure hovering right above my face. all i could make out were his piercing red eyes, like lights shining from the pitch black void of his shape. all around him was darkness and flashing, like someone turned on a strobe light in the middle of the room i was in. the light reflected from all the shattered glass on the floor flashed right back in my face.

i tried to scream but my mouth and lungs failed me. i struggled to move my arms, legs, shoulders, anything just to get out of this nightmare. i couldn't tell for sure, but it felt like this figure was pinning me down to the ground as he spoke to me, sounding like he was whispering and shouting at the same time:

"you're gonna die here if you keep going"

before i had the chance to respond, or even understand what he meant, my limbs finally listened to my brain and i shook myself out of it. my body lunged forward from off the dirty mattress i was laying on, and my lungs breathed in a great big gasp of air. my eyes opened wide and saw the morning sun peer through the dilapidated windows in this empty church. i sat there to catch my breath for a second, let my heartbeat settle for a bit, wondering what the hell just happened.

"keep going"? going where? deeper into this world? i'm trying to find my way out, but i keep finding myself digging deeper into it. this isn't right, none of this is right. everything is backwards. how the hell do i...

that's it. the mirror. i remember now.

i lunged forward with what little energy i collected from that faint bit of sleep i somehow managed to catch, and rushed straight to the bathroom next to me. it was all in complete disrepair; faucets didn't work, dirt and grime everywhere, flies buzzing around the toilet clearly used from whoever squatted here last, with no water to flush it down. it was heinous, but i had to face it all to know. i closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and turned to the mirror next to me. shattered, broken, but still reflecting the room around me. everything but my own body.

what? this isn't right, why can't i see myself? what the fuck am i supposed to do now? wasn't staring into my reflection the whole reason why i found myself here in the first place? i can't find it anymore. what am i, a vampire? what the hell is going on???

i left the church, breaking through the great big wooden board that i had slipped through stealthily the night before, pieces of snapped wood flying everywhere. i had to find another mirror. i had to keep trying.

i ran. i ran so far that my legs were burning and my chest ached. i felt a stitch coming on in my left side and i pushed past it. i bumrushed every bathroom i could find, in every building i came across. nothing. no reflection to find. absolutely useless.

i kept running, scrambling to find mirrors anywhere i could. i noticed all the stares around me, all the piercing eyes and nasty comments, growing more loud and intense. i noticed that dark aura around everyone growing deeper and thicker around them.

over and over again.
i'd blink and find a mirror without my reflection.
i'd blink and find myself running.
blink and see people staring.
blink, the auras grew.
blink, there's another mirror, no reflection.

running.
so much running.

i felt so exasperated, with nothing but my sheer panic to keep me going. the sky got darker again. the fog came back, even thicker this time. everything seemed so jumbled up and led to nowhere. lights started strobing around me again. i felt like how i did in that waking nightmare, completely dizzy and trapped with no way out. no control over my body anymore. it kept running without me even telling it to.

in the midst of all this panic, i noticed those auras had seemingly combined and formed their own autonomy. big dark shadows shaped like people, with nothing but red eyes piercing from their heads. they were now the ones chasing after me. i could hear their voices and threats ring louder and louder in my ears until they all surrounded me. i wasn't running towards anything anymore; i was running from them.

their stares burned into my flesh. their words brought up all my deepseated fears. they told me to give up, to break one of those mirrors i've been so desperate to find myself in and slice my own throat with one of the shards. i couldn't escape them. i couldn't even fathom where i was heading.

i turned a corner on the street, opened a door in the building next to me, and found myself walking out of another door into another street corner. none of the geography here made any sense at all. i was completely losing my mind and all sense of direction. i felt so hopeless and worthless then. why can't i do anything right?

i never confessed to being religious, but i felt like my god had completely abandoned me. there is no god in this world. i'm just lost in this complete state of limbo, with nowhere else to go.

just then, i turned and saw an old church with a great big wooden plank in place of the door. i looked around to see if anyone was there, and i slipped in as quietly as i could. i didn't want anyone to know i was here. i closed the plank door behind me and made sure my tracks were completely covered.

when i walked in, i found an old, empty room with nothing in it but dead bugs, broken shards of stained glass, and a gross, beat-up mattress. there weren't even any pews on the floor. aren't those supposed to be nailed nailed into the floor? 

before i could think too hard about it, my legs started buckling under my body. i went over to the mattress and collapsed on top of it. it smelled awful. everything in this room smelled awful. i looked up at the what was left of the ceiling, big naked wooden planks half-chewed from termites, covered in spiderwebs and mold from rainwater seeping through the cracks. the whole thing looked like it was gonna collapse on top of me eventually. maybe that'd be for the best. at least i wouldn't have to live in a world like this anymore.

somehow i passed out. exhaustion took hold amongst those awful voices that bounce around in my head like a ring echo, until it all turned to noise and feedback loops.

i woke up in the middle of the night, feeling a presence in my room, i looked down and saw a lit cigar held in front of my face. i looked up, and there he was.

i jumped back in the mattress, startled and worried he might hold me down again. he seemed completely unfazed by this. he just stared at me with those searing red eyes, but for some reason i felt no malice in his presence. i took a breath, keeping my gaze pointed to him, trying hard to be ready for anything while doubtful of my ability to be. i took the cigar and, with seemingly no other choice of action, took a great big hit from it.

the sensation burned my throat and i coughed a good amount, but i felt a buzz in my head that helped me breathe easy for a while. i looked up at him inquisitively, critically, never quite letting my guard down fully. was this a gesture made in good faith? why did he look and feel so evil? what did he mean by what he said before? did he know something about this place that i didn't?

before i could say anything, he spoke to me again in that same voice that somehow whispered and shouted all at once.

"i told you not to keep going"

my head shot back in disbelief. "are you kidding? where was i supposed to go? how do i get out of here?"

he took the cigar from my hand and ashed it on the floor. "there is no way out anymore."

my jaw dropped. i struggled to find the meaning in those words, much less trust them. he could tell.

"you should've listened to me" he said as he passed the cigar back in my direction.

i took it in my hand but didn't do anything with it, just let it hang there like a limp noodle. i was in complete shock. i couldn't understand. i wouldn't. with the last bit of courage and strength i could muster, i stood up and yelled everything i had been thinking up to that point.

"are you kidding me? what was i supposed to do? what do i do now? how am i even supposed to trust you? you're just like everyone else here, just following me around and calling me out, telling me to just give up. how can i give up? how can i leave behind all the people i knew and loved back where i came from? what the FUCK do i do now???"

in all my frantic energy, hot tears started streaming down my face. my mouth filled with spit as i shouted all those words to this entity, this shadowperson in front of me, someone i could barely even tell was real besides his obvious interactions with me. i didn't even know what was real anymore.

the man took a great big sigh and stood up next to me, then turned and walked towards the broken windows of the room. "come here, take a look outside."

in all my astonishment, i saw his deep breath and raised him one of my own. i took a second to calm down and regain my sanity, then followed his lead and looked outside, through all the smashed-in stained glass portraits that barely resembled anything anymore. i could barely tell what i was seeing amongst all the blurry, distorted, impossible streets. everyone had left. it felt like we were the only two beings in the whole world. i was sure that would change by the morning, but in all the confusion and messiness of the world, i somehow felt a sense of peace. i took another drag of the cigar and passed it back to him as he continued on.

"this world reflects what you bring to it. it is not a world of hostility, but of indifference. it is simply a mirror. it reflects your confusion, your aimlessness, your self-hatred. you came with all of those things and nothing else, so you will get nothing else from here."

i took a second to think back at what i could've brought with me. all that pain, sorrow, anxiety that i had felt in my old world had increased tenfold since i came here. all those feelings i was so used to, now i felt i could never escape from. if this being was telling the truth, that notion was right.

"i'm sorry to break it to you this way. i have no power over this place. i don't do anything but observe. i've seen you in your darkest moments, your endless running. in a way, this world is a microcosm of what you felt before. you couldn't leave that feeling behind. you still can't, and that's why you will never return. you'll spend your last waking moments running from your own fears and self-torment, and that'll be the mark you leave behind."

with every last shred of hope fading away, i turned to him and asked desperately "there's really no way out? are you sure?"

he turned back to me to meet my gaze. "what's the one thing you want in the whole world, more than anything? more than getting out of this place and back to your world?"

i thought for a moment, but it didn't take me long. "there's someone i wanna see again, but i don't think i ever will. i don't expect anything from her anyway. i just want her to know that i'm sorry, and i hope she's okay."

the shadowman laughed to himself and shook his head a bit. "i'm sure she knows that more than you realize. don't worry about it. just think of the good, and keep that with you in your final moments here."

he put out what was left of the cigar on the windowsill, embers still burning out, a smoke trail leading to the broken curling above us. as he walked away, he mentioned one last thing to me out the side of his mouth.

"find your god. not the one you pray to, the one you carry"

i blinked, and he was gone. it was morning again. all the somber peace i had felt in that moment left with him.

i stood there, wondering why i had even felt that peace with him in the first place. he was one of *them*, wasn't he? was he on my side or was he against me? or, true to his word, was he just as indifferent as he said this world really is? i didn't know what to think anymore. i no longer had time to.

the voices grew louder again. the figures reappeared on the street. i could feel them all staring at me through the window, locked onto me even from the small view they had through what was left of this destroyed place. the strobing started again, filling the whole room with this blinding, staticky, uncomfortable sensation. i couldn't take it anymore.

i ran to the bathroom, past the clogged toilet and all the flies surrounding it. i looked up at the broken mirror and still couldn't see myself in it. something snapped in my brain and i started laughing maniacally, barely able to stop myself to even breathe. then i let out a great big bloodcurdling scream and punched the mirror, shattering it even more. i kept hitting it with both of my fists, blood seeping out of my fingers, glass shards sticking out. i didn't care. i kept going. i started smashing my face against it, laughing and screaming as i went on. the mirror had completely fallen apart. i found one large blade of glass that fell into the sink, and i stopped myself.

memories started flashing by my eyes. not the bad ones i had been used to before, but the good ones i had forgotten about. the first time i had ever seen that girl at work. the time i had approached her, when we started talking and flirting together. the budding of true love coming into fruition. before all the complications of life had ruined it all. before all the mistakes and hurt feelings and things left unsaid. i saw her face, plain as day, right in front of me, as if she was really there.

i opened my eyes through all the blood pouring from my forehead. i picked up the blade and looked into the glass. i finally saw myself. i looked deep into my crazed expression, all the torn flesh and broken, mangled features. i started to wish i hadn't, but i couldn't look away. i gripped the blade in my fist, tearing into the skin behind my knuckles. i stared deep into myself and realized what i had become. i lost all hope.

i'm not safe here, and i can never leave.
