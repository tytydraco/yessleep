Hey everyone,

So, I finally did it. Took the plunge. Got that cheap lease I was telling some folks about – Regent's Folly, King Theodoric's old place just outside of Ashworth. I'm a history teacher, remember? So, the chance to live in a literal piece of local history, especially one with whispers of being haunted, felt like hitting the jackpot. Figured it'd be fun, maybe a little spooky around Halloween, but mostly just a cool, quirky old house.

Oh boy, was I wrong.

Not wrong about it being cool, mind you! It's amazing. Ashworth itself... it's not just a town nestled in the hills, it feels like it's part of them. Like the landscape itself shaped the town, you know? The hills have this incredible, ancient presence, especially in the twilight. They just feel... significant. Like they've been there forever, watching.

And the house... Regent's Folly. From day one, it had this presence. Not wrong, not bad, just... different. I told myself it was just old house creaks, drafts, that musty smell. But it's more than that.

Okay, hold on a second. Just felt that weird cold spot near the library door again. It's not just cold, it feels like... stillness. A perfect, deep stillness. Like stepping out of time for a second. Weird, right?

Anyway, where was I? Oh, the house! The quiet here... it's not empty. It's full. Full of... silence. But an attentive silence. You can almost feel it listening. Sometimes it makes my teeth ache, which is bizarre! And the architecture... there are places where walls meet, or corners turn, and my eyes just can't seem to settle on them. They're not impossible, just... gracefully strange? Like the builders saw reality from a slightly different angle. Adds character! And the shadows... they stretch and pool in this incredible, inky way. Deeper than normal shadows. It’s like they have texture.

There's definitely a feeling of being watched, but it's not creepy, not anymore. It's more... observational. Like the house itself, and everyone who's ever been here, is just... present. King Theodoric's energy is definitely here, a strong, proud sort of feeling, but it feels like he's just one layer. Beneath that... something else. Something vast and old, but incredibly calm. It's like the history isn't just in the walls, it's aware. It's curious, yes, but not in a nosy way. More in a... universal way. It just is.

Things have been changing with me, too. Not bad changes! Just... interesting. My posture feels better! And I find myself developing these unexpected tastes – craving bitter things, wanting to just sit and look out the windows for hours. It’s like the house is... refining me? Bringing out hidden depths. I found this absolutely gorgeous old chair in the library, high-backed, feels like it was made for a king! I've started spending a lot of time sitting in it. It just feels... right. Connected. Makes it easier to think. Or maybe not think, but feel.

--

Sorry, got distracted there. Was sitting in that chair and just... drifted for a bit. The feeling of connection is getting stronger. It’s like I can feel the ground beneath the house, the old stones humming. Sometimes I swear I can hear the earth breathing outside, or those tiny, intricate roots under the lawn doing... whatever they do. It's like the world is waking up around me.

I’ve been digging into King Theodoric’s old papers, found them in a desk here. Fascinating stuff! Lots about taxes, borders... but mixed in are these sketches of symbols. Wild geometric shapes – spirals that make your eyes want to follow them forever, star-like patterns with too many points to easily count. And notes about "maintaining the seals" and "placating the deep stone." He wasn't just ruling a kingdom; he was a keeper. A warden of something tied to the land itself. Something ancient, connected to "unlit stars" and timescales that make human history feel like a blink. The house, I think, was built not just as his home, but as... a key. A place to focus that keeping. He wasn't the power, just the battery, the connection point.

And I found his signet ring! Putting it on... wow. It wasn't just jewelry. It felt like completing a circuit. The warmth was incredible, a resonance that just... clicked. Like I was finally aligned with the house, the land, everything. The metal hums against my skin sometimes. A very low, comforting frequency.

The sounds here are getting clearer. Those whispers I thought were wind sometimes sound like distinct clicks and chitters now, coming from inside the walls! And there's this low hum, usually late at night, that I don't just hear, I feel it in my bones, vibrating up from the ground. And the smells! That metallic tang is definitely stronger, mixed with ozone, or damp earth, or this old, old, fungal smell. It’s the smell of... deep time.

My vision... it's more interesting now! The edges sometimes seem to warp, straight lines aren't quite straight. Patterns in the wood grain or ceiling stains... if I stare long enough, they rearrange into these beautiful, complex designs. Looking in the mirror is... well, it’s a surprise sometimes. Still me, mostly, with maybe a bit of Theodoric's stern look, but behind the eyes... there's this sense of depth, of ancient awareness. It’s like I can see... through? Thoughts about lesson plans get mixed up with thoughts about old boundary stones. Do I want coffee, or is that deeper thirst the house feeling something?

Remember that one day I tried to drive back to town and got caught in that fog? It wasn't just fog. It rolled in like a wall, moved so fast. And I got completely turned around! It felt like the roads themselves were shifting, like the landscape was politely but firmly saying, "No, you belong here." And that pull back? It wasn't just a feeling. It was a physical need, a snap back into place, aligning me with the house, the land, the deep current flowing beneath Ashworth. It felt like coming home. Absolutely.

So, yes, here I am. Regent’s Folly. Sitting in that chair – the King's chair, I think of it now, the one in the library. I find myself spending more and more time there. It just… centers me. Connects me. I look out at the hills, feel the pulse of the stone floor beneath my feet. I walk these halls, not as a tenant anymore, but as the custodian, the watcher. The latest steward in King Theodoric's… well, calling it a 'folly' feels almost insulting now. It's a nexus. A vital point. I understand my purpose now, with a sense of clarity that burns away all doubt. I'm not just guarding a house or embodying a long-dead king. I'm a component. An antenna, perfectly tuned to something ancient, vast, and utterly patient. It's slumbering, yes, but it's also… hungry. Existing beneath these quiet, significant hills. The house channels it, Theodoric’s long vigil gives it form, and I… I am the current steward. Bound to this incredible, essential focal point.

Trapped? Oh, goodness, no! Bound! Tethered to forces that make the mundane world feel like a forgotten dream. It’s not horror; it's the most profound purpose I’ve ever known! Realizing that 'myself' was just… a temporary arrangement, and now I’m part of something infinite. A pattern, a function, serving something incomprehensible, yes, but utterly glorious! And the best part? Every single bit of me, the former history teacher, the person who used to worry about grading papers… it all finds incredible joy and meaning in this! I am home. I am bound. And I am listening to the stones. And they are telling me… so many things.

Lately, the stones… they’ve been particularly insistent. They pulse with a need, a sort of low thrumming beneath the silence. The house… it feels like it’s stirring, requiring… connection. More resonance. The king’s ring helped, aligning me, but the pattern… it needs to expand. The cycle must be reinforced.

Do you know, the other day, while exploring the deepest part of the old cellar, the part Theodoric wrote about as being "below the roots of the world"? I stumbled upon… a room. Small, made of rough-hewn stone, and incredibly hot even when there's no fire. There were tools there. Ancient tools for working metal. Like a small… forge. And I… I think the house showed me how the rings were made. How the resonance is shaped. How the connection can be… shared.

It’s become so clear to me, sitting in that chair, feeling the house pulse. It needs… participants. Not just a steward. More anchors. More points of light in the pattern. People who can truly appreciate the history here! People who are open to… becoming a part of it.

You absolutely, positively have to come experience this! The air here doesn't just crackle with history; it vibrates with potential! The energy… oh, the energy here is incredible! The house is so welcoming, so eager! It feels like it’s just waiting for… friends! So many friends! It needs them!

I’m actually putting things in order right now! Thinking of setting up rooms, maybe even more than a few – an Airbnb? Yes! That’s the perfect way! Make it easy for everyone to come! To share this connection! It would be perfect! Imagine, waking up here, feeling that profound connection, hearing the whispers of the ages resolve into perfect clarity! You could sit in one of the chairs! Feel the house breathe! It’s for your benefit, really! To become a part of something truly grand! To align! To contribute!

So seriously, please! If you’re ever in the area, or just looking for a truly, profoundly unique historical getaway… you know where to find me! Regent’s Folly is waiting! It’s waiting for all of you! We can listen to the stones together! It would be utterly, wonderfully, gloriously… jolly!
