I logged onto Netflix like any other night, expecting to unwind with a good movie. However, as I glanced down at the section to write my five usernames, I froze. There, in those five-word messages, lay a distress signal I could not ignore. "Kidnapped. Need your help urgently."Confused and alarmed, I typed my response, choosing my words carefully. "Who are you? Can't understand." The seconds dragged like hours as I anxiously awaited a reply. Finally, words appeared on the screen, "Name's Emma. have been kidnapped." I was skeptical. Was this a practical joke; how did this person have my password.

Summoning courage, I asked, "Where are you? Any clues?" I knew the five-word limit would make it difficult for her to provide enough information, but I had to try."Clock tower, window view," she responded. A faint glimmer of hope stirred within me. At least she had given me something to work with.

"Describe surroundings, please," I typed, hoping for any detail that could lead me to her. Her reply was brief but specific, "City skyline, red brick building." I mentally scanned the city's skyline, trying to recall any red-brick structures.

"Is your captor in the building?" I inquired, my heart pounding. I needed to know if I was walking into a trap. Her answer chilled me, "Yes, be careful."My mind raced with possibilities. "shall I contact the police?" I asked, desperate for a plan. Her answer was direct, "He knows them. Please Don't."I racked my brain for ideas.  My mind went back to the TV I had sold to a pawn store recently. Could it be connected to her captor? It may have still been logged in to my account when I sold it, he could have purchased it for her not knowing much about technology, somehow she got the wi-fi but only had this tv.

Refusing to back down, I asked her, "Where did you last see?" I needed to gather more information to narrow down the search. Her reply sent shivers down my spine, "Abandoned building. Please hurry."Determined to find her, I logged onto netflix with my phone in order to communicate with her on the move and  I scoured the city, trying to locate the clock tower on the south side. The messages continued to guide me, leading me closer to the abandoned building.With every step, I grew more anxious, wondering what awaited me inside. "What else can you share?" I typed, hoping she had more clues. Her message arrived, "Clock tower, south side. Help." It was vague, but it was something.

Taking a deep breath, I stood before the abandoned building, the clock tower in the distance. There was no turning back now; I had to go in. My heart pounded in my chest as I stepped into the unknown.

My heart raced as I entered the abandoned building, my breath visible in the cold, damp air. The creaking floorboards beneath my feet echoed through the empty hallways, creating an eerie atmosphere that sent shivers down my spine. The messages had led me here, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.

With each step, I cautiously explored the creepy house, searching for any sign of Emma or her captor. The old walls seemed to hold secrets, and the silence was deafening. "Emma?" I called out softly, hoping she might respond. There was no answer, only the echo of my own voice.I pushed on, guided by the messages' cryptic clues. The faint glow of the clock tower on the south side kept me going, a dim beacon in the darkness. As I reached a narrow staircase, I noticed a faint flicker of light coming from an adjacent room.

Curiosity got the better of me, and I followed the light, my heart pounding loudly in my chest. The flicker led me to a room at the end of a narrow hallway. The door was slightly ajar, and I hesitated before pushing it open.

Inside, I found a small, dimly lit room with decaying furniture and peeling wallpaper. The flickering light came from an old TV hanging on the wall, and my breath caught in my throat. The TV was logged into my Netflix account.

Fear and confusion swirled within me. Had Emma been here, using this TV to communicate with me? But where was she now? Was she caught? The chilling thought that I might be walking into a trap clawed at my mind.

Before I could gather my thoughts, a message appeared on the TV screen in bold letters, "Too late, you are next." Dread washed over me as I realized the truth. Emma had indeed been here, and her captor had caught her trying to reach out for help using my Netflix account.

Panic set in, and I turned to leave the room, wanting to escape from this ominous place. But as I turned, I came face to face with the sinister captor. My heart pounded, and I was paralyzed with fear. "So, you followed the breadcrumbs," the captor sneered, a twisted smile playing on their lips.

Adrenaline surged through me, and I mustered every ounce of courage. "Where is she? What have you done to her?" I demanded, my voice trembling.The captor's laughter echoed through the room. "You think you can save her? She's long gone now. And you will make an excellent replacement."Fear gripped me, but I couldn't let myself be taken without a fight. With a surge of determination, I bolted toward the exit, but the captor was fast, and before I could reach safety, they grabbed hold of me.

Summoning all my strength, I broke loose from the captor's grasp and raced through the dark, winding hallways of the abandoned building. Fear propelled me forward, and as I reached the exit, I burst into the cool night air.

I didn't look back as I ran, my heart pounding in my ears. I couldn't save Emma, but I had to save myself. The chilling realization that the captor was still out there, and they had plans for me, gnawed at my mind.

From that night on, I lived in constant fear, always looking over my shoulder, never knowing when the captor might strike. The messages had stopped, but their haunting words echoed in my thoughts.No one believed my story, thinking it was a twisted tale of a troubled mind. But I knew the truth, and it haunted me every day. Emma was gone, and the sinister captor still roamed free, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike again.

I kept the Netflix account out of morbid curiousity, but nothing happened for over a year until one night when I turned my tv on and where the user names should be, it spelt out "look behind you, at window"
