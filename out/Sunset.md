“So you guys really think this might be an untouched site?” Asked my younger sister Naomi from the back seat of my sedan. Kelly, my girlfriend replied while pulling her blonde hair into a ponytail, “we couldn’t find anything on it online but we didn’t want to call around and possibly tip anyone off”. 

The long vacant band of asphalt snaked it’s way deeper into the Four Corners area. Naomi watched the Martian-esque landscape fly past the window.  

“You guys are fairly experienced with stuff like this right?” Naomi asked, “fifth one this year” replied Kelly. 

I chimed in, “we’re meeting Josh, my friend from college and cousin Dan there. They’ve both been on a few expeditions with me previously”. I caught a brief smirk cross Naomi’s freckled face. 

“And Josh is still too old for you” I added. Naomi laughed, “sure Bill, but only because he’s getting over someone else”. 

Miles glided by, our thoughts accompanied by the soft hum of tires on asphalt as the LeSabre faithfully carried us towards our destination. 

The sight of a hewn stone building brought me out of my day dream. We had arrived at our meeting point. Sitting under the shade of the small store was Dan, dark hair spilled out from under his wide brimmed straw hat. His jeans and white button up lightly covered in dust. 

“Howdy” I called while leaning out my window. Dan tilted his hat back revealing that trademark grin. “Took you guys long enough”. His eyes focused on Kelly a moment longer than necessary, his gaze was interrupted by a crashing sound.

The saloon style doors at the front of the store banged open loudly. “Well look what the cat drug in!” Yelled Josh. Stepping out of the car I greeted him with a hug. Josh nodded a greeting towards Kelly. “Hey Kelly, been awhile”.

“Hi Josh, it’s nice to see you again” said Kelly, she then turned to Dan, “and you must be Dan, Bill has told me so much about you”. 

Dan accepted her extended hand and shook it, he glanced at me, “yeah he’s mentioned you quite a bit as well”. Naomi waved Kelly over, “come on, this is our last chance to use a real toilet”. 

Josh walked me over to his Jeep, “I made sure to be fully prepared this time, lockers, lights and tons rope”. Dan grabbed my arm, “you never said anything about Kelly being bilagàana”. 

I pulled my arm free, “why would I? Is that a problem?” Dan held my gaze for a bit, finally he looked away. “No, no it’s not”. 

“So…” interrupted Josh awkwardly, “this place you and Kelly found. It’s pretty far out right?” Happy to change the subject I replied, “yeah we’ll be able to drive for a lot of it but there’s going to be pretty decent hike at the end”. 

Seeing as how this was as good a time as any I got my map out of the Buick. “Ok so we came in on I97. We’ll set our odometers and when we’re 11.3 miles in we need to turn off the road. From there we can take this dirt track eight more miles. After that it’s all on foot”. 

“Looks like the girls are ready, let’s load up and head out before the day gets any hotter”. Said Dan.

Back in the driver’s seat of the Buick I watched as Naomi opened the rear door of Josh’s Jeep. She made brief eye contact with me then with a mischievous grin climbed into the lifted truck. 

Kelly laughed beside me, “that sister of yours knows what she wants”. I winced at the thought, “nasty. I don’t even want to consider that”. 

On the road I felt the sun piercing through the windshield. It’s radiation carrying rays digging into my already dark skin. Kelly being the pale person that she is applied sunscreen lavishly across her chest, cheek bones and exposed arms. 

“Damn Bill, it’s  9:30 in the morning and the sun is already too hot”. I merely grunted and cranked the AC knob to the highest setting, the geriatric fan wheezed a little harder forcing the tiniest amount of lukewarm air onto us. 

The sweat spots on Kelly’s shirt was evidence enough that the AC wasn’t cutting it. My eyes lingered on Kelly a moment longer than they should have and I nearly drove right into the back of Josh’s Jeep. 

“Eyes I on the road Bill!” Kelly commented in pretend anger. The tires of Josh’s Jeep turned and he carefully disembarked from the asphalt. With a bit less caution and a lot less comfort I followed behind. 

The hard packed dirt slowly morphed into a fine grit that gave way to what we call moon dust. Sand so fine digging a hole in a lake would yield better results. The inevitable happened just a few dozen yards into the moon dust. My engine revved up as I lost speed and quickly came to a stop. 

The sound of my horn alerted Josh that I would no longer be driving. Once he reversed next to me Josh parked the Jeep and walked over. He wiped his brow, the short walk enough to make him sweat, “So that’s as far as the grandma car is going to make it huh?” 

“Yep, time for me and Kelly to load up in the Jeep. This road only goes for another mile anyways. But every mile driven is one less to walk”. 

Having foreseen this situation our bags were already packed. “Geez” muttered Naomi as Kelly and I squeezed onto the narrow bench with her. 

“It’s crazy how we’ll be within a hundred miles of Papaw’s house” said Naomi. Kelly elbowed me, “hey it might be time I finally meet the rest of your family. Not that Naomi isn’t great and all but I’d love to be introduced to everyone else”. 

“You picked a smart one” commented Naomi. 

The Jeep reached the end of the road saving me from having to reply. 

“Looks like it’s time to break out the sunscreen and hiking boots!” Yelled Josh as he enthusiastically jumped from the Jeep. His open door was like a portal to hell, boiling air rolled in and engulfed us in its thick grasp.

 Soft sand rolled over my boots as I stepped from the Jeep. Shielding my eyes from the sun I pointed to the west, “that’s the way”. I was slightly envious of Dan’s large hat, it felt as if my hair was absorbing every ounce of energy the sun was putting out.

Shortly thereafter we walked in single file. Each step reduced to half it’s normal length by the loose incline. I felt my legs began to burn before the Jeep had even left our sight. 

Kelly came up beside me as I stopped to check the map, behind us Naomi wiped sweat from her brow as she leaned on Josh. Dan tossed his backpack to the ground after retrieving his water bottle. 

“Damn Bill, we’ve been on some hikes before but this might take the cake”. Dan swished his bottle as if judging the level of its contents. 

With Kelly’s help I confirmed we were on track, with that our much appreciated break came to an end. One foot in front of the other. Keep your hands elevated and your eyes forward I told myself. 

I nearly stumbled as the terrain suddenly changed, taking the time to pause and consult the map I saw we were on track. I could smell Kelly  before I heard her. “Were close Bill, really close”. 

My hands trembled slightly, if we had done everything right than we were within a matter of yards. 

“Bill! Bill over here!” Kelly bounced with excitement, “come on!” She ran down an incline to my left. I fought my way across the granulated earth, just ahead, peeking out from a hidden cliff side was our destination. 

Doors roughly resembling inverted triangles and irregular square windows dotted the rock face. Kelly was a dozen yards ahead. Naomi, Dan and Josh followed close behind me. 

“Dude that’s fantastic” said Josh. Dan took out his camera, he touched the medicine bag tied around his neck then he pressed two fingers to his lips. Satisfied Dan began taking photos of the long abandoned homes. 

I felt my own medicine bag, more out of respect for tradition than anything else. 

Kelly took my hand as we ducked into the first room. We photographed every dish, every mark on the walls, every item was carefully recorded and logged. 

It was late in the afternoon before we had finished cataloging the first abode. Kelly was working on the back room while Dan and I tried our best to record the wall paintings. Kelly’s scream caused us both to crash into one another. 

I pushed myself free of Dan and scrambled to my feet only to see Kelly walk out of the back room. “Sorry guys, I thought I saw something but it was a trick of the light”. 

“Damn babe you nearly gave me a heart attack!” I said. Kelly chuckled but I felt like it was overly forced. “What did you see?” I asked. She shrugged her shoulders, “it was nothing. You know the shadows we saw in Japan? The remnants of the bombings?” 

I shuddered at the thought of that solemn memory, “yeah, how could I forget?” 

Kelly replied, “well it looked like there was one on the back wall, only I hadn’t noticed it earlier. So I took a picture of it and it moved! Like I said, it must have just been the light”. 

Dan jammed his camera into its case and snapped it shut. “It’s time to go Bill”. Without waiting for reply he quickly walked out of the structure. 

Kelly followed after him, “hey! What’s the hurry? What’s going on?” Dan yelled, “Josh! Naomi! Pack it up we’re leaving!” 

I ran after Dan, catching up to him I grabbed his arm. “Yo, dude, what’s the rush? We’ve got an hour until sundown and a couple more until it’s truly dark”. 

Dan spun around ripping his arm from my grasp, “you know damn well what’s up! You can stay if you want but I’m leaving right now”. 

I jogged back to where the other three were waiting, Naomi was fidgeting with the medicine bag on her belt. A nervous habit she had picked up years ago. 

“What’s up with Dan?” Josh asked. I shook my head, “he’s spooked is all. But it wouldn’t hurt to start heading back. 

We started going about packing everything up. The light was fading but I wasn’t worried, our packs would be lighter on the return trip and it would be mostly downhill. 

That was until Naomi ran out of the nearest building eyes bulging with panic. I caught her as she stumbled in her haste to escape. “Naomi what the hell?” 

She didn’t reply, she just pointed to the place she has come from. The unassuming wall looked no different than before. “Wait” whispered Naomi. 

My eyes picked up a faint silhouette between the door and the window. A human shaped smudge was ever so slightly visible against the stone wall. 

My legs felt weak and goosebumps rippled across my flesh. Pure undefiled panic coursed through my body, the shadow moved across the wall and disappeared through the black doorway. 

Naomi pulled on my shirt, “Bill, Kelly and Josh are still in there”. 

My feet were moving before I could think, I whispered every prayer to every god I could think of in the second it took me to reach the doorway. 

The blackness of the interior was solid, I crashed into it. My body hit the ground in a heap. Hands grabbed me and pulled me to my feet. “Run Bill!” It was Josh, he tried to force me out of the door. I wouldn’t leave Kelly. 

I slipped to the side allowing Josh to stumble into the warm sunlight outside. It was cold in the room, painfully cold. 

I searched desperately, the dark was asphyxiating me. It’s thick presence filled my lungs and smothered my cries for Kelly. 

I found myself crawling while hundreds of enraged fingers drug against my skin. I wasn’t welcome, I didn’t belong. 

Finally I found Kelly, she sat unaffected on a stone stool. A slight smile playing across her lips, almost as if she were trying to use her face for the first time. 

I pushed against the weight of the darkness above me, I managed to grab Kelly and pull her into an embrace, “we have to go babe! We have to get out of here!” 

Kelly smiled joylessly, “I won’t”. Was all she said. 

Unwilling to accept that answer I picked her up and pulled her towards the door, the door I could barely see through the sea of shadows in my way. 

The faceless entities crashed into me, each one holding no more force than a feather in the wind. But together they hindered my progress and wore me down. 

I could see the door, salvation lay so close. Kelly began to convulse in my arms. Her arms and legs spasmed uncontrollably, she drove her head backwards into my face. 

I nearly dropped her as pain exploded through my skull, a wave of blood flooded my mouth. Somehow she managed to rotate herself, I screamed. Her teeth sank deep into the soft tissue of my shoulder. I stumbled, I lost sight of the door. 

I couldn’t see but I knew I was traveling deeper into hell. A hand grabbed mine, a warm human hand. I was violently jerked through the door and into the dying light of the late afternoon sun. 

Naomi stood over me terror all over her face. “Oh fuck Bill you’re bleeding!” We didn’t have time to worry about that. Kelly lay limp across me, I threw her over my shoulder and started running east. 

“Go go go!” I called out. Josh and Naomi needed no encouragement. Long shadows of desert plants stretched out before us. The sun was sliding it’s golden body behind the horizon. 

I felt as though the few remaining rays of light were all that stood between us and death. 

As fate would have it just as the sun began to disappear entirely the roar of Josh’s Jeep came exploding over the nearest dune. 

Dan yelled from the window “get in! We’ve only got one chance at this!” We plowed through the last few yards of sand. Kelly lay limp until she touched the Jeep, her body went rigid. She bucked against me, screams of primal desire crawled out of her throat. 

Her arms and legs were spread wife as she resisted entering the Jeep. Finally Naomi and I over powered her and forced her through the door. We piled on top of her as Dan took off with reckless abandon.

The bumpy terrain proved not to be an obstacle for Josh’s Jeep as Dan simply held the throttle down. He didn’t slow when we reached asphalt. 

“Where are you going?” I asked. Dan angled the rear view mirror, “Papa’s house”. 

I shook my head, “no way, not like this”. “Shut up! Look at her Bill! Take a real long look! That’s why you don’t bring her kind along, you know this!” 

Josh threw his hands up, “screw you Dan”.

Kelly still feebly pulled at us, her eyes darted wildly under their lids. I had never seen her so pale before, I knew Dan was right. 

Before midnight we arrived at the trailer Papa lived in. Dan rushed inside, I cussed him from afar knowing he would spill the beans in the most unflattering way possible. 

Josh helped Naomi and I carry Kelly towards the trailer. 

Before we got to the front porch Papa came out in his bathrobe, he swung his walking stick nearly bashing me over the head. 

“Back! Back! Do not bring that into my home! Throw it on the table”. We gently laid Kelly on the outdoor table. Papa’s calloused hands gripped my face, he pulled me down to his level. “Did you bring your medicine?” 

“Papa Kelly needs…” Papa’s rough hand slapped me. “Bill my child, did you have your medicine with you?” He demanded. 

Eyes watering I nodded, “yes Papa”. Papa sighed, “and Naomi?” I nodded. 

“Good, my family is safe then”. Josh raised an eyebrow, “yeah I’m gonna bounce. This outside my comfort zone”. 

Papa looked to me, I nodded affirming the unasked question. Josh always carried the small bag I had gifted him years ago despite having no faith in it. 

I thanked him then turned back to Papa, “please! Kelly needs help”. Papa gave a dismissive wave, “there are many like her out there”.

Kelly moaned in pain, Naomi held her hand. “Bill her pulse is through the roof. She’s burning up”. 

I only had one play left, “I’m going to marry her Papa. She will be your family regardless of what you want”. 

Papa paused his walk, taking advantage of this I continued. “I love her Papa, we’re going to have kids together. Don’t make me choose between her and you”. 

Naomi begged as well, “Papa she’s a good woman, if you can save her please do it”. 

His shoulders slumped in defeat. “Very well. Prepare for a cleansing ritual”. 

Naomi and I carried Kelly to the hut far behind Papa’s house. We laid her on the bed of boughs, Papa shooed us out. “Come morning she will either be clean or her spirit will have left”. 

I sat on the log outside the hut, my head hung low. “How could I have been so stupid? We never should have gone to that place”. 

Naomi rubbed my back, “come on bro, there’s no way anyone could have seen this coming. And if it makes you feel better I’m totally over Josh”. 

I raised my head, “yeah? Why’s that?”

“When you and Kelly were in that room, and we could see all those shadow demons swarming you he just stood there. When you started screaming I told him to help me but he never budged. Being scared is understandable, but not acting is such a boner killer”. 

Sometime in the night Dan joined us, he hugged me tight. “I am sorry cousin, I did what I thought was the best”. I patted him on the back, “no you were right, this is something beyond our abilities”. 

Sometime in the night Naomi fell asleep, Dan retrieved a blanket for her and we sat. The night sky greyed, the singing of birds announced the coming sun. Though I shivered throughout the night I felt that the hour before dawn was the coldest.

With the sun came hope and warmth. The huts old leather door opened, Papa emerged from within. Leaning against him was a nude and bewildered Kelly. Pulling the blanket from Naomi I cast it over Kelly and pulled her into a hug.

Her blank eyes flickered with recognition. Than as if a tidal wave of memories engulfed her Kelly dropped to the ground and began to sob. 

I glanced up at Papa in concern. He placed a hand on my shoulder, “she will survive. The scars of what she felt may never fully heal but she will live. Unfortunately despite my greatest efforts I was not able to save the child”. 

I looked at Papa in confusion, “child? What child?” Naomi was now awake and she knelt beside Kelly and I. “She was pregnant Bill, she was planning on telling you when we got back”. 

My mind was racing, I had been a father. We weren’t extraordinarily careful but I had never suspected anything. I felt a wave of grief for the child I would never have a chance to know. 

We carefully guided the barefoot Kelly back to Papa’s trailer. As I helped her sit on the couch my phone rang, “hello?” I answered. 

“Hey Bill, sorry to call so early but that son of mine never came home last night. Did Josh happen to spend the night with you?” 

My stomach sank, I felt nauseous. “I’m sorry, he didn’t. I’ll ask around”. I hung up before Josh’s Mom could ask anymore questions.

Papa was watching my carefully. “I need to go look for Josh, hopefully he didn’t break down or something”. Dan stood up, “I’ll come with. I had some friends bring you car here last night”. 

Naomi and Papa would look after Kelly while Dan and I searched for Josh. 

I sped down the road towards Josh’s house. I was so focused on the possibilities of Josh being stranded that I didn’t see the cop. 

Of course he pulled me over, I was doing twenty above the speed limit. I dropped open the glove box to grab my registration, my hand froze. 

Laying on top of the jumbled papers was a leather pouch. I knew it all too well, I had made it myself all those years ago. 

Josh’s medicine bag. 

Dan looked at me, “how long has that been there?” 

Josh hadn’t been in my car since the start of spring break, nearly a week ago. He had been as equally unprotected as Kelly this whole time. 

Dan didn’t need an answer, he knew as well as I did that we need to go back to the haunted city. Before the sun set on Josh.
