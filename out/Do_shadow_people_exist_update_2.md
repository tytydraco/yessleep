As I type this I still don't know if my last post ever went through, or if anyone is reading this. I don't know why I'm even typing this other than the act of Journaling makes me feel a little less insane. I think the building doesn't want me to leave. According to my phone I've spent the last 24 hours wandering the hallways of the apartment complex unable to get back to my apartment. At first I just wanted to leave this place but after hours of hallway after hallway and floor after floor I given up on the idea of leaving and just wanted to get back to my apartment.  After a while I given up on the idea of appearing normal,  because either something is seriously wrong, or I've gone off the deep end.

I started knocking on doors at random, hoping to find a human, any human. I can't help but think if I could just find someone that will answer everything. Either I'm not the only one trapped, or it's official,  I need some quality time with a pair of grippy socks. After hours of wandering I finally see a familiar sight. Never once had I thought I'd be excited to see the building manager's door, but that excitement was short lived. His door was cracked open. Now, Roger is a shtickler for the rules. Anyone whose lived their whole lives in apartment buildings will know the type. Any excuse to get in everyone's business and a list of rules everyone has to follow to the T, but if anything actually needed done, you might as well be talking to a wall. So his door being left open? At this hour? Odd. 

Despite the open door I still knock. All the lights off, so common sense would say he's sleeping, but there's nothing common about this place anymore.  "Roger?" I call out into his dark apartment. "Are you home?" I was met with silence. I'd never let myself in to someone's home but this was different, I needed answers. I slowly push the door open and quietly walk into the apartment. As I scan the apartment nothing looks out of place, until I make it to the bedroom. What I saw made my blood run cold. "What the hell." Slipped out. The walls of his bedroom, was covered with photos, of everyone. Each tenant had dozens of photos of them asleep, portions of the entire wall dedicated to different people, except me, there was only 2 photos of me on the wall, one of me on my balcony, and another of me sleeping. I still feel sick thinking about it. I start ripping photos off the wall, but there's so many, I couldn't possibly take all of them with me. This might had been selfish but I took the photos of me with me. I guess sometimes there is a benefit of being unable to sleep most nights. I left the apartment, and on my way out I got that same feeling like someone is watching me. I turn around and I see a silhouette in the door frame of Roger's room. I didn't know where I was going, but I started running. Hall after hall I ran as fast as I could,  which admittedly isn't very fast but I've been told once I get going it's like watching a charging bull. 

I eventually tire myself out and stop to catch my breath, I look around and see nothing odd, and for a split second I almost didn't notice but I was standing infront of my apartment. I've been back here typing this for a while now, I feel like I should be relieved, but nowhere feels safe anymore and the noise from Pam's apartment is ever present. After listening to it for a while I've determined it sounds like furniture being dragged across the apartment.  Typically I would never do this, but I need answers. I worked up the courage to look myself.  I don't know what's worse, what I found in Roger's apartment, or what I find next. I checked Pam's door and of course it was locked, why would this be easy? The building is decidedly in on this whole thing. I ram the door with my shoulder several times and it wouldn't budge. So I put my all into one less push and the door rips open, but I think I dislocated my shoulder, that thought was quickly interrupted by the disorder of the apartment. I wish I could say I was surprised but I've been listening to this chaos for days now. Furniture strewn across the apartment in ways that make zero sense. A couch in the kitchen, the fridge next to the door, pots and pans everywhere, smashed glass and broken tables. None of this seemed to matter, because there he was, as clear as day. Roger was dead in the middle of the apartment. 

I refuse to step foot inside. I couldn't help but feel like if I went in there I would had met the same fate. So I return to my apartment and begin typing this. I don't know if anything I say will ever be read, but I think I'm going to die here.  I've considered jumping from this window, at least then I'll die on my own terms, but that just seems too easy. I've considered making a rope out of bed sheets like you see in old cartoons, but that seems unreasonable, and with my weight I'd probably still end up dying.  If anyone is reading, if you don't hear from me again then I guess you have the answer to what my fate is.
