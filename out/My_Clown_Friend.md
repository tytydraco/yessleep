I was at a carnival with my parents and a clown who starred and walked slowly towards me and my parents. He gave me a balloon and I remember him saying "I'll see you soon" he smiled and laughed with his sinister face. I felt something touch me, it felt like a prick as I thought it was a rock that hit me. My parents told me to stay away, that he was crazy, I thought that my parents were wrong and he was friendly and lonely but I should have listened to my parents. When we go into the car I saw him out of the back window standing on the side of the road staring like usual.

When we got home I was tired so I climbed up the stairs and went to bed in our two story house while I was sleeping. My parents stayed up and watched tv. I woke up around 2 am, the tv was blasting loud with static on it I went down the stairs and look at my parents still watching the tv and told them to turn it down, they didn't so I did it for them with the remote they where emotionless didn't even move a inch, they were almost pale. I heard a knock at the door so I opened the front door to see through the screened glass the clown standing there with blood stains.

I opened the door, hugged him and said welcome. I took him to my room, skipping up the stairs and down the hallway. Happy I was but I shouldn't have been. He put something into my army and I fell asleep as my eyes slowly shut in the hallway. I couldn't see clearly but I remember the vivid images of the clown taking me out the door right before we left. I saw the most horrifying thing... my parents had knives in their head dead and blood was splattered everywhere. There was stuffing coming out of them and what I saw was horrifying.

I woke up again very vivid to me in a white van like the ones a delivery driver would use. It had no stickers, the windows were black, blacker than burned wood. I screamed and banged on the door knowing what had happened. Thoughts rushing through my mind, are my parents dead, am I being kidnapped, will I die? I still had my phone on me so I called 911.

911 Operator: 911, what is your emergency?

Andrew: I NEED HELP I'M BEING KIDNAPPED!

911: Operator: What is going on to describe the details?

Andrew: HELP, HELP HE IS GOING TO KILL ME!

911 Operator: I need details

Andrew: (mumbling and screaming)

911 Operator: Hello, are you there?

(The line ended)

The van stopped and rolled into a small house he took me out and put me in a small room about the size of a moving box. He put down food and water and closed it shut. There was a window which was a huge mistake he made. The clown pushed something like a dresser In Front of it but I couldn't get out. My hands in handcuffs I broke off with a chipped piece of the wall that was hard and rocky. I broke the window and got out. I tried to escape but the man grabbed my foot as I was halfway out the window.

I smashed his face with a rock and his temples were bleeding rapidly. I got out the window and ran through a forest for an hour until I saw a car. I went in front of it and it stopped and out came a woman in a red shirt with some blue jeans. She was wondering what happened as I looked like an escaped person from an asylum. She wondered what happened but when I said we need to go now. She put me in her car and quickly we left. I saw the clown behind the car running after me. She took me to a police station 30 minutes away and reported the case I told her.

The sun started rising as I stood there. The same man who walked into the police station tried to grab me and run with me but got stopped by a police officer who pulled his gun and shot the man 12 times. One of the bullets hit my arm. He died and I was right next to him I was bleeding out and was quickly rushed to the hospital. I had a full recover and now I know I am scared for life from the distinct man.
