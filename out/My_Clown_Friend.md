I was at a carnival with a my parents and a clown who stared and walked slowly towards me and my parents he gave me a balloon and I remember him saying "Ill see you soon" he smiled and laughed with his sinister face. I felt something touch me, it felt like a prick as I thought it was a rockthat hit me. My parents told me to stay away, that he was crazy, I thought that my parents where wrong and he was friendly and lonely but I should have listened to my parents. When we go into the car I saw him out of the back window standing on the side of the road staring like usual.

When we got home I was tired so I climbed up the stairs and went to bed on our two story house while I was sleeping my parents stayed up and watched tv. I woke up around 2 am, the tv was blasting loud with static on it I went down the stairs and look at my parents still watching the tv and told them to turn it down, they didn't so I did it for them with the remote they where emotionless didn't even move a inch, they where almost pale. I heard a knock at the door so I opened the front door to see through the screened glass the clown standing there with blood stains.

&#x200B;

I opened the door hugged him and said welcome. I took him to my room skipping up the stairs and down the hallway. Happy I was but I shouldn't have been. He put something into my army and I fell asleep as my eyes slowly shut in the hallway. I couldn't see clearly but I remember the vivid images of the clown taking me out the door right before we left I saw the most horrifying thing... my parents had knives in there head dead and blood was splattered everywhere. There was stuffing coming out of them and what I saw was horrifying.

&#x200B;

I woke up again very vivid to me in a white van like the ones a delivery driver would use it had no stickers, the windows where black, blacker than burned wood. I screamed and banged on the door knowing what had happened. Thoughts rushing through my mind, are my parents dead, am i being kidnapped, will I die? I still had my phone on me so I called 911.

&#x200B;

911 Operator: 911, what is your emergency?

&#x200B;

Andrew: I NEED HELP IM BEING KIDNAPPED!

&#x200B;

911: Operator: What is going on describe the details?

&#x200B;

Andrew: HELP, HELP HE IS GOING TO KILL ME!

&#x200B;

911 Operator: I need details

&#x200B;

Andrew: (mumbling and screaming)

&#x200B;

911 Operator: Hello, are you there?

&#x200B;

(The line ended)

&#x200B;

The van stopped and rolled into a small house he took me out and put me in a small room about the size of a moving box. He put down food and water and closed it shut. There was a window which was a huge mistake he made. The clown pushed something like a dresser Infront of it but I couldn't get out. My hands in handcuffs I broke off with a chipped piece of the wall that was hard and rocky. I broke the window and got out. I tried to escape but the man grabbed my foot as I was halfway out the window.

&#x200B;

I smashed his face with a rock and his temples was bleading rapidly. I got out the window and ran through a forest for it seemed an hour until I saw a car I went infront of it and it stopped and got out a woman in a red shirt with some blue jeans. She was wondering what happend as I looked like a escaped person from a asylum. She wondered what happend but when I said we need to go now. She put me in her car and wiuickly we left. I saw the clown behind the car running after me. She took me to a police station 30 minitues away and reported the case I told her.

&#x200B;

The sun started rising as I stood there the same man walked into the police station tried to grab me and run with me got stopped from a police offer pulled his gun and shot the man 12 times one of the bullets hit my arm. He died and I was right next to him I was bleeding out and was quickly rushed to the hospital. I had a full recover and now I know I am scared for life from the distinct man.
