There’s a peculiar rhythm to life in Morton’s Grove, a small town nestled deep in the forested valleys of the Pacific Northwest. The sun would peak, cast long shadows over the quaint streets, and by 3 PM, the town would be eerily silent. Doors would lock, shutters would close, and not a soul would be seen outdoors. It’s always been this way. Ever since I could remember, everyone in Morton’s Grove abided by this unspoken rule: be inside by 3 PM. 



No one ever explained why. The few times I asked my parents, they’d exchange worried glances and change the subject. It’s just how things were. It was the only life I knew until I turned seventeen, I grew restless. The curiosity gnawed at me, an itch I couldn’t scratch. What was out there after 3 PM? What was everyone so afraid of? 



On a crisp autumn afternoon, I decided I’d had enough. It was Friday, and school let out at 2 PM. I told my friends I had something to do, ignored their puzzled looks, and walked slowly home. I kept glancing at my watch, feeling my heartbeat quicken with each passing minute. 2:30. 2:45. I was close to home, but I lingered by the old playground instead. 2:55. My palms were sweaty, and a chill ran down my spine despite the sun’s warmth. 3:00. 



I waited, expecting something to happen immediately. But there was nothing. The wind rustled the leaves, and a squirrel darted across the road. The silence was unnerving, but it was still just Morton’s Grove. I started walking, aimlessly at first, then with more purpose as my confidence grew. The town was mine. I was free. 



The first thing I noticed was the absence of birds. They’d been chirping all day, but now the silence was absolute. I wandered towards the town square, where the statue of our founder, old Mr. Morton himself stood solemnly. As I approached, I felt an inexplicable sense of dread. The shadows seemed longer, the air heavier. I shook it off. It was just my imagination. 



I was about to turn back when I saw something move at the edge of my vision. A dark figure, slipping between the trees by the old library. My heart skipped a beat. I wasn’t alone. I called out, but my voice sounded small and weak. The figure paused, then disappeared around the corner. Against my better judgment, I followed. 



As I rounded the corner, I found myself face to face with a creature that defied description. It was humanoid, but its limbs were too long, its skin too pale, and its eyes… its eyes were hollow voids, darker than any shadows. It stared at me, and I was paralyzed with fear. The thing opened its mouth, and a sound like a thousand whispers filled the air, drowning my thoughts. 



I turned and ran, my feet pounding the pavement, my lungs burning. I could hear it behind me, a soft, scraping sound, like nails on a chalkboard. I reached my house, fumbling with the keys, and slammed the door shut behind me. My parents were in the living room, their faces pale and drawn. 



“You stayed out,” my mother said, her voice trembling. 



“I’m sorry,” I gasped, my whole body shaking. 



My father stood, looking out the window. “It’s already marked you,” he said quietly. 



“What does that mean?” I asked, but they wouldn’t answer. They locked all the doors, drew all the curtains and told me to stay in my room. The night passed slowly each minute an eternity. I heard whispers outside my window, soft taps on the glass. I didn’t sleep. 

The next morning, I hoped it had been a nightmare, but the fear in my parents’ eyes told me otherwise. The town was different now. People avoided me, whispered when they thought I wasn’t listening. I wasn’t just rebellious; I was cursed. The thing I was, whatever it was, had claimed me. 



Days turned into weeks, and the fear grew. I saw it everywhere–-in reflections, in the corner of my eye, always watching, always waiting. I tried to tell my friends but they looked at me like I was crazy. Maybe I was. 



And now, as I write this, the sun is setting. It’s 2:55 PM. I can hear the whispers growing louder, feel the dread curling around my heart. I don’t know what will happen tonight. Maybe it will finally come for me, maybe it will take me away to wherever it came from. 



If you’re reading this, heed my warning. In Morton’s Grove, be inside by 3 PM. There are things in the shadows, things that should not be disturbed. I was foolish, and now I pay the price. Whatever happens, don’t follow in my footsteps. 



Stay inside. Stay safe. And whatever you do, never be outside after 3 PM.
