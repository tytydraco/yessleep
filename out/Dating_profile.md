*I’m not here for a good time.  I’m here for a wood time.*

I shoved my eighth slice of pizza into my mouth and chuckled at the headline.  Instant turn on.  A woman with a sense of humor.  I mean she wasn’t exactly a looker—she was just as obese as myself—but who was I to judge.  If I had even the slimmest chance of getting laid, I’d shower her with love and food and bed sheets covered in crumbs.  Even a man who lives in filth should get a shot at connecting with someone, right?  I sent her a message.

Cynthia responded and invited me over to her place.  I just about fell out of my chair onto a pile of toenail clippings.  I reached for another slice and devoured it in seconds.  Even though my picture was hideous, my confidence skyrocketed.  I grabbed a two-liter out of the fridge and took several gulps.  I put on my howling wolf tee shirt—women love a good wolf shirt—and struggled to slide my jeans on over my fat legs. 

When I arrived at her place, the door was partially open.

“Come on in Josh,” she said.

She lived in a giant apartment complex and was in the third unit on the second floor.  Her living room was filled with candlelight.  An entrance for a king.  My queen waited for me in her bedroom.

“You really went all out,” I said, when I finally came face to face with her.  She stood at the end of her bed in a blue silk nightgown. 

She stepped forward and pulled me into her arms.  She immediately went for a kiss, which I was certainly not expecting.  And that’s when things went dark.

I woke up what felt like hours later, and her bedroom was below me from my vantage point.

“Huh,” I said wearily, trying to come to. 

I soon realized that I was suspended in the air.  Sharp pain emitted from my hands.  I craned my neck to the right and noticed that my hand was nailed to a piece of wood.  Same with my left hand.

“What did you do to me?” I said quietly, as my voice was not fully there yet.

Cynthia walked inside.  “Lovely, you’re awake!  Oh Josh, how I’ve dreamed of this night.  You should look at yourself.  I got a great shot while you were out.”

Cynthia turned her phone and showed me the screen.  It was a picture of me nailed to a wooden cross attached to her wall.

“I… I don’t understand.  Get me down.  What are you doing?  It hurts.”

Cynthia got on her knees and started praying.

“Help me,” I tried to yell.  “Someone, please help me.”

As I tried to break free, my stomach churned not only with fear, but with the medium pizza I had consumed before heading to her place.  The vomit rose to my throat, and I spewed out a waterfall of cheese and blood.  A piece of the wood broke free from the wall, and then another piece.  The entire cross collapsed, and I came crashing down to the ground.

The thud must have been extremely loud because seconds later, neighbors were pounding on the front door.  Cynthia lunged at me, but I managed to get by her and run to the front door.  The police officers arrived quickly and took her away.

As for me, I decided to take some time off from online dating.
