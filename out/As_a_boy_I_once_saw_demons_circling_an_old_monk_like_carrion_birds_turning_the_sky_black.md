The old monk looked up, shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand. The clouds looked strange, black and thick, curling like smoke above where he now sat on the top of the mountain.


“So it has started,” he said. I heard him from farther down the trail, carrying pails of water for us to drink. Back then, as a seven-year-old boy, I lived in the nearby village. I always wished to learn from the monks. They knew secrets.


“Old father,” I said, dropping the heavy pails of water on the top of the mountain clearing where the monk sat in his ochre robes, his legs crossed full-lotus in the eternal symbol of meditation. “What are those clouds, do you think?” He didn’t look up at me, and for a moment, I thought he might not respond.


“Boy, there are things in this world you do not yet know. The wonders of enlightenment, yes, but also the strange and evil demons who rule the sky and who torture the evil-doers in Naraka. They see I am weak, and that I have not yet attained enlightenment. They come here to torment me, to see that I am reborn,” the monk said, his voice wavering and cracking as he came to the last word. “They know I have failed. I have not attained Nirvana.”


The old monk did look weak. His hands trembled, and his legs under the robe looked like thin, brittle sticks. His eyes watered constantly, drooping, the whites looking more like yellowed jelly than sclera. But in the center of those eyes I saw a blazing determination and a deep energy.


“All beings know the horrors of rebirth. Is this not true, old father?” I asked, sitting down beside him. He shook his head.


“I will not,” he said bluntly, his voice gaining strength and volume as he spoke. “I will not be reborn. This cycle must end. This is my last body. I swear it on the sky and on the trees and on the mountain that we stand upon. The demons will not win.”

The old monk had gone to a doctor. The doctor had looked at him, his sickly and jaundiced appearance, and had immediately begun running tests.


“You have terminal liver cancer,” the doctor said. “I am sorry, but you will not live out the month. It has progressed too far.”


“So it is. So it is,” the monk said calmly. “All things arise and pass away.”


“I can write you a prescription for…” the doctor began, but the monk waved him off.


“No medicine,” he said. “Thank you for telling me this great secret, doctor. The secret of my death. Now I have time.” After speaking these cryptic words, he got up and calmly walked out of the office, heading towards the deep forests and high mountains of his country from which, he knew, he would never return.

The monk had told this to me as he walked up the mountain to his final place of meditation. I had cried then, tears streaming down my cheeks.


“But who will teach the townspeople?” I asked. “Who will perform acts of compassion and spread wisdom with you gone? We have no one else, old father. You are the last.” The monk walked on silently for a moment, thinking deeply under the bright light of the sun.


“You will, perhaps,” the monk said quietly. “We have always passed on wisdom, from big hand to small, from old to young. Someone will come, I believe. People who want to attain the highest wisdom are rare, yet they still exist, even in a world so far gone.”


Strange sounds came from the sides of the trail. It did not sound like animals, but rather like high-pitched screaming and laughter. I would catch glimpses of black, hateful eyes in the brush, but when I turned to look, they would already have gone.


“Do you see?” I whispered. The monk nodded slowly, not a trace of fear in his voice.


“They are not here for you,” he said. “They are here for me.”


“But why?” I asked.


“They are demons, my son,” he said. “Their joy comes from death, from pain and loss. And the greatest loss is the loss of enlightenment, of wisdom and peace. They know this. Their instincts tell them, just like the cheetah knows which of the antelopes is slow and hurt before the hunt even begins. They should not trouble you. But if you wish to turn around and go, I will not hold it against you. This is my journey, not yours.”


“I will stay by your side until the end,” I said, smiling up at him. He looked so sad, but he still stood up straight and proud. Occasionally, he would grab at his stomach and bend over, moaning. He would take a few deep breaths and, sweating and wavering slightly, he would return to the trail.


But as I looked forward to where the trail ended, my breath caught in my throat. The sky had turned black over the peak of the mountain. In that blackness, I thought I saw glimpses of eyes and a smile.


“Will they kill us, old father?” I asked, my voice trembling. He walked on in silence for a long time without answering.


We made it to the top of the mountain. I had never been so high before, and the beauty of the view took my breath away for a moment. I stood there, staring out for hundreds of miles, seeing the rolling hills turn into flat plains and ocean. Towns shone on the land below us, looking dark and tiny, the people like ants. But the blackness of the clouds and the strange, demonic noises from the forest ruined much of the beauty.


Without ceremony, the monk put down his meditation pillow in the middle of a patch of soft grass. He looked down at it, then he looked over at me.


“I will not be rising again,” he said. “You must return home alone after the end.”


“I will,” I said. “You have shown me fearlessness. I will be like you. I am not afraid of death or demons, just like you. I can get home by myself.”


“Your parents will worry,” the monk said. I shook my head.


“This is more important,” I said. “I will stay by your side until the end. You will not be alone.”


“I am never alone,” he said. “I walk the path of the Buddha. He is here, by my side, on the trail and above. I’ll follow him out at the end, I hope.” I didn’t understand what he said, but I smiled the same.


“Now I must sit and meditate,” he said. “Time is short. Do what you will, my son. You always were a good boy, standing by the side of a man who is dying.”

The lightning and hail began within minutes of him sitting down to meditate. I tried to take refuge under the great canopies of the trees. But the monk got pelted with hail, great balls of ice that smashed and cracked against the ground. I saw some hit him on the head, causing streams of blood to run down his face and soak into his robes. And yet, he never reacted, but breathed slowly in, then breathed slowly out, concentrating his mind on the final goal.


As the storm then worsened, lightning began to strike the top of the mountain. The blasts felt like bombs, and the trees split apart under the force of the explosion. But the monk did not react. I moved further into the woods, but not so far that I could not see the monk. I stood there, huddled and shaking, wondering why I had come so far. And yet, when I looked at the clear, calm face of the monk, my doubts disappeared.


“He is alone, dumb boy,” I chided myself when the terror grew too great. “Would you leave him to die? Stay with him until the end. Let him know that at least one person cares for his life.”


But the storm didn’t end. It grew more intense, and from the darkness of the sky above, I saw many eyes looking down on the monk. They looked upon him with hatred and hunger, as if they wished to eat him alive.


From the forests below, I heard many footsteps. There was great laughter, demonic and low. And from the trees, I saw abominations emerge. On the trails and the paths, they walked. I had gone to the edge of the forest, where I could look down the mountain and still see the old monk. 


They looked mutated and sick, the demons below. Their skin had great gouges, blisters and cuts, maggots and pus pouring out from each of the wounds. Some walked on two legs, others on four, and they bit and clawed at each other as they walked, some snarling or shrieking, others laughing and chittering like hyenas on the prowl.


The old monk, by this point, looked bloodied and hurt. The hail and the chunks of trees from the lightning had hit his body over and over, and from dozens of deep wounds, blood trickled down to his robes. But his head wasn’t bowed, and he emanated peace. 


“He is bloodied, but his head is unbowed,” I said to myself, thinking. It seemed to have great relevance, but I couldn’t understand why.


As the demons approached, the lightning began to strike closer and closer to the monk. The ground shook with each blast, and I feared the mountain may fall apart from the strength of the crash. The first row of demons had seen the monk. The bloodlust and loathing that showed from their eyes made me scared. I took a step back into the forest, trying to hide myself as best as I could.


But as they approached, the monk opened his eyes. Light seemed to stream from within him, great waves of it that came from his eyes.


And for the first time in his life, he must have experienced the greatest bliss. His eyes widened, and eternity seemed to pour from deep within him. Those eyes never moved, but they seemed to see everything. A small smile formed across his lips. For a moment, I felt like I looked not upon an old man, but a blazing pillar of light.


“I have attained peace,” he said, pulling a knife out of his robes and putting it to his throat. “Despite my dying and my sickness, I have attained peace. I will not be returning, never, to this world.” And with a look of bliss beyond anything I have ever seen, he slit his own throat and died.


And the moment he died, the black clouds and thunder and demons receded, and I found myself standing under a bright summer sky, alone with the corpse of a man who would never return.
