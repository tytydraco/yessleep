"I killed a camerahead" the note sat on a stump, weighed down only by an old camera with a visibly shattered lens. 

I've found plenty of weird things in the woods, this isn't even the first camera I've found here, I don't know if it was the note or the deliberate nature of the cameras position, but it stuck out to me.

Initially I wanted to walk past the sight, but something in me forced me to turn back and take the camera. That's when I found the note. It was just a bit smaller than the base of the camera, the paper was damp, the ink smudged but still legible. 
"I killed a camerahead."

I wanted to scoff at the writing but there something about it that fascinated me. 
I let out a shaky breath, a plume of white exiting my lips and dissipating into the cold autumn air, I put the camera and its accompanying note into my jacket pocket. 

I knew there was little to no chance the camera even functioned, but that's not why I took it with me, that's not why I brought it home, that's not why I was sitting at my kitchen table and inspecting the camera. I was curious. 

Upon my further inspection of the device, I found something I hadn't noticed before, exposed wires sticking out from the bottom of the camera. I ran my finger along the wires, they felt metallic but also.. fleshy? Almost like veins.

I further inspected the camera, looking for a power button or something, but no luck. 
I let out a soft yet nervous chuckle "no wonder this got tossed, you can't even turn it on.." 

I stood up from my chair and walked the device over to the trash, tossing it in to the empty can along with the strange note. I felt a pit form in my stomach as I did, but I shrugged off the dread, I knew it was irrational, the camera was just a piece of junk. 

I took a cold shower to calm my nerves, it helped calm my nerves, though the nagging feeling of dread that hung over me was still present, it was more tolerable now. 

As I tried to fall asleep, I couldn't help but focus in on noises I'd otherwise find innocuous. The creaking of treelimbs, the tapping of branches at my window, the 'click, click, click' of..  "what the hell is that?"
'Click, click, click' 
My head turned towards the window, catching a soft white flash from outside. 
I tried passing it off as lightning at first but it wasn't storming out, or even raining at all for that matter. 
I tried chalking it up to my imagination, after all, the clicking had stopped, maybe I was just tired. Yeah, that's what It was, I was just tired. 
I turned onto my side, looked away from the window, and shut my eyes. 

'Click, click, click' 

I bolted upright and stared at the window, catching another bright flash of light. 
It wasn't my imagination, I knew that now. 

'Click, click, click' 
The light flashed through my window again, this time blindingly bright. 
'Click, click, click'
