I have nothing left, I escaped but if I’m honest I wish I hadn’t. I just hope that Dimples didn’t make it out.

My name is Jeremy, my family and I had moved from the city to a small suburban town two months ago. The house me and Claire(my wife) had bought was double the size of the townhouse we had just moved from. Claire was a teacher and had transferred to the now local school, and I worked remotely. I set my office up on the ground floor, it was right next to the door that led down to the L shaped basement. 

The basement wasn’t your traditional dark and dingy storage space, the hard concrete walls were painted all white with dusty grey painted floorboards. The wooden stairs, while tired and slightly warped were also painted to try and bring some life back into them. The previous owners had left their pool table and various arcade machines down there, along with various other furniture throughout the house. The reason why though, was unknown the realtor said to us. Our two kids Harry(8) and Charlotte(6) would love it as a play space I thought. 

It was a Saturday afternoon, a month after we had moved in. Claire had not long come home with Charlotte, they had both been shopping at the mall for most of the day. I was finishing up some work in the study, I could hear Harry playing with the Arcade machine down in the basement. Charlotte suddenly came running into the room, she tapped her hand on my knee. 

“Daddy, daddy, look what I’ve got!” Charlotte full of excitement said, while waving a small balloon animal at me.

“Awww, honey, did you get that at the mall?” I asked while turning my chair and bending down to her. 

“No silly,  Dimples gave it to me” she said.

“Dimples? And who might that be Charlotte?” I asked playfully. 

“The clown daddy, Dimples the Clown is my friend!” she replied.

“Ok then, well you go off and play, daddy needs to finish his email” I said while giving her a quick hug and kiss on the head. 

Charlotte ran off out of the room and down the stairs to the basement, I could hear Harry playing Street fighter behind the running footsteps of Charlotte. I finished the rest of my email and went to the living room where Claire was watching an episode of a Netflix series. 

“Hey hun, how was the mall?” I asked while sitting down. 

“Yeah, alright, I managed to find Charlotte some new school shoes” she said, the exhaustion in her voice was evident.

“That sounds. Fun” I responded full of sarcasm.

“Oh trust me, it was. I’m sure she tried on at least 25 pairs before she settled on one!” She said in annoyance.

“Well at least it’s done. You can relax now” I replied .

“Yes, I’m trying too” she said, gesturing me to take the hint. 

“Ok, Ok, I’ve got to finish up some reports anyway” I said while getting up. 

“Have fun!” Claire said sarcastically.

I was about to walk out of the room when I had remembered the reason why I had gone in  there. 

“Claire honey?” I said while turning around.

“Uh-huh?” She murmured, her mind and eyes fixated to the TV. 

“Did you get Charlotte a balloon animal from a clown while you were at the mall?” I asked.

She shook her head. 

“No, why?” She enquired 

“She had this balloon animal and said she got it from a clown” I said confused and slightly worried. 

“She could of found it when we were out, I was holding a lot of bags, so I probably didn’t  notice” she explained.

“Hmmm, Okay, just kind of weird, that’s all” I said, while turning to walk away. 

“I think I did see her holding it actually, don’t worry” Clare said as I walked out of the living room. 

I sat back down to my laptop, my mind still feeling slightly creeped out about what Charlotte had said. I could hear her laughter sounding in the background as footsteps came running up the basement stairs. Harry came into the study. 

“Are you done yet dad?” He said while hovering by my left shoulder.

“Soon dude, I just have to submit this report and I’ll be done” I replied.

“Ok, I will set up the Xbox upstairs so we can play” Harry said while leaving the room.

“I’ll be up soon!” I shouted back as he ran upstairs. 
 
After I had finished and sent over my report I turned the laptop off, I walked past the door to the basement. I could hear Charlotte talking and giggling, I thought I would double check on her. 

“Charlotte honey, are you ok?” I asked while making my way down the creaking wooden stairs, it fell eerily silent. 

“Charlotte?” I called out again, now slightly worried. 

“Hi Daddy!” Charlotte said popping out from around the corner. 

“Who were you talking to down here?” I asked expecting to hear her say she was playing, or speaking to some imaginary friend. 

“I was playing with Dimples Daddy” She said in excitement. 

“Oh nice, Can I meet Dimples?” I replied slightly concerned by how real she made him sound. 

“Sorry Daddy, you can’t, it has to be a secret” she innocently said while running back round the corner to her play space. 

I followed her a second after she disappeared round the corner. I turned to where she had ran, I stopped as confusion and panic washed over me. She was gone. 

“Charlotte? Where are you honey!” I shouted now in a soft but firm tone. 

“Claire! Claire!!” I alarmingly shouted to my wife. 

She came running down to the basement, her footsteps heavy with dread. 

“What, What’s wrong!” She said while trying to catch her breath. 

“I can’t find Charlotte, she was just here” I said while my breathing fell deeper. 

“She has to be here somewhere” Claire replied while searching under the pool table.

I walked over to where Charlotte had been playing, I looked down at the crayon drawn papers that littered the floor. They were all of the same thing, a colourfully doodled clown. The silence was suddenly broken by rippling taps coming from the small storage cupboard under the stairs. It was almost like someone’s fingernails had ran down the other side of the door.

I slowly walked up to the door. 

“Charlotte? Why are you hiding from me?” I asked my voice now soft and calming. 

I grabbed the handle and pulled the door open, there standing was Charlotte giggling with her hand covering her mouth. 

“You found me!” She yelled while scampering out. 

“Don’t do that again, you had us worried!” I said back to her, my face and tone now stern and full of warning. 

“Listen to daddy Charlotte, you could have been hurt in there!” Claire said while bending down to hug her. 

“You can’t come down here on you own again Charlotte. You have to play next to your brother, in future, OK?” I said with slight anger muddying my soft tone. 

She nodded. 

We all walked back up the stairs, I flicked the light off as I neared the door. I quickly turned it back on again once I heard a shuffling noise coming from the darkness behind me. I hesitantly walked back down the stairs, the wooden panels groaned under every step. A faint sound echoed from round the corner, it was music. The quiet melody grew slightly louder as I turned the corner. There sat amongst the scribbled drawings on the floor was a small wind up music-box. Every hair on my body stood on end, as the cupboard door began to creep open slightly. I had that feeling of dread fill my body, just as the music box stopped. The silence then smothered me as I had a rush of confidence, I marched up to the cupboard and flung open the door. Nothing but an old broom and some leftover paint tins met my eyes. I closed the cupboard door and walked back up the stairs. I shook my head at how I’d nearly let my own fear get the better of me. 

Later that night when the kids had gone to bed, me and Claire were engrossed in some easy watching discovery channel programme.  We then heard what sounded like the basement door open, and two sets of soft footsteps walking down the stairs. It was the kids. 

“I’ll go” Claire said while letting out a deep sigh in annoyance. 

I continued to watch the TV as Claire walked past me and towards the basement, after around 10-15 minutes they still hadn’t come back up. I thought it was a bit strange but maybe she was talking to them down there. Five more minutes past before I finally decided to check on them, I neared the closed basement door, that’s strange I thought, the door would normally be open. I opened the door, my eyes were met with darkness. 

“Claire? Kids?” I called down, my voice echoing into the dark depths below. 

I flicked the lights on, as they blinked and buzzed before settling, I made my way slowly down the steps calling out to them one by one. 

“Claire?”

“Harry?”

“Charlotte?” 

As I neared the bottom, I heard a sharp scrape on the floor to my left, it sounded like something heavy and metallic being picked up from the floor. The faint sound of the music box played once again. As I slowly rounded the corner, my body instantly seized up in shock, in front of me, sat, slumped up against the wall was my sweet loving family. Blood splattered across the white wall behind them, and their faces, their once beautiful, sweet faces had the same large forced smile on them. Two metal nails sat imbedded into each one of their cheeks, stopping that awful smile from dropping. Tears rolled down my face as my whole world crumbled in front of me. 
The music box then stopped playing.

“Jeremy. oh Jeeeremy” a scratchy, sinister, almost tuneful voice spoke, beckoning me from within the cupboard which was situated to the left of the bodies of my family.

“Why did you have to stop my fun, we were having, sooo much fun!” the voice continued while letting out a loud, deranged laugh that bounced off the surrounding walls. 

“What do you want? Why have you done this!” I uttered through my heartbroken tears.

“She, tried to stop our game, and you, you tried to stop Charlotte from playing with me” the voice grew deeper into a rasping growl. 

It continued. 

“Now I can play with them as much as I want, just look how happy they all are!” It said, while a pasty white bony hand, clutched the edge of the cupboard door.

I backed slowly away as a small figure emerged from the cupboard. He was around 5ft tall, wearing large blood soaked shoes. A deep red gown covered his body and was topped with a polkadot ruffed collar. He had a shiny white face with a painted red smiling mouth, exposing crooked yellow teeth. Two metal nails were pressed firmly into each of his cheeks. His eyes were dark and menacing, with black coloured face paint lining each eye, which then arched over his brow. His smooth, glossy forehead was marked by a small child’s bloodied hand print. Upon his terrifying head sat straight, bright red patchy hair. He gradually lifted a rusted bloodstained metal hammer up that he was clutched in his right hand, as he just stared into my eyes. 

I was frozen for a second before turning to run, I darted up the stairs, lunging 2-3 steps at a time as a demented laugh rang from behind me. I stumbled through the door and firmly closed it shut, resting my back on the cold, grainy wood. I closed my eyes, my breath spluttered out in quick shallow bursts. I then suddenly found myself unable to breath through fear, as I heard footsteps slowly thump up the stairs behind me. The footsteps were accompanied by the sound of metal scraping across the wall. 

The voice then echoed from behind the door.

“Jeremy!”

“Jeeeremy, I just want to make you smile!”

I ran into the kitchen, turned on the gas stove, I grabbed some oil from the counter and a box of matches from the drawer. I hurried back to the basement door just as the footsteps stopped. A bang and a crack reverberated through the door, a large split began to form through the middle. I doused it in oil just before I struck and threw the lit match onto it. A flame engulfed the door as I ran out of the house and into my car. 

After I drove out of our wall enclosed driveway, an amber flash lit the road behind me as my house exploded into a fireball. I pulled over  further down the road, as I began to break down into tears. I called the emergency services sobbing as I told them I had escaped a fire in my home, but my family were still inside. They ultimately ruled it as a combination of a kitchen fire and gas leak. 

Once the funeral of my wife and kids had taken place, I stayed at my parents house for a couple of weeks, I have now since moved across the country, into a small apartment. It’s been a month now and I still have not slept a solid night since. As I lay here thinking and writing about that terrifying murderous clown, I just can’t help wondering, what happened to Dimples, did he perish in the fire or did he somehow make it out?!

After all, they only ever found 3 bodies inside.

The most ironic thing to come from all this, is I don’t think I will ever smile again…
