My brother won’t stop playing dead, I’m getting really pissed.

My brother has always been an odd one, ever since he was little. When he was old enough to talk and walk, he would always do this thing. He would play dead, my mom thought he would grow out of it but he never did. At around age 5 my mom got concerned and took him to a doctor, the doctor said there was nothing mentally or physically wrong with them.

They just suggested that she take him to a children’s therapist, she did. So far it hasn’t helped, he’s now 7 and still plays dead. For hours at a time, I really don’t understand it, I mean there is nothing wrong with him. It would be different if there was, but there’s not. So why does he do this? 

My mom pretends it doesn’t happen, she treats him like a little baby. Even when he plays dead, she just says that he’s expressing himself in ways we just can’t understand. I don’t understand how playing dead is a way to “express” your emotions. He makes me so bad. 

All of the attention goes on him, my mom will pretend like he’s really fooling her. She even pretends to call a ambulance, which is when he stops playing dead. He’ll jump up with a “Gotcha!” And start dancing. 

She spends 24/7 with him, acting and playing. It pisses me off so much, why does he get all of the attention just because he’s a freak? 

I’ve never really liked him, I spend most of my time ignoring him. My mom tries to get me to pretend to really think he’s dead with her, but I refuse to do that. I refuse to make him think I’m okay with him doing that, because I’m not. I never will be. I hate it. 

I’ve told her how much I hate it, but she’s still convinced that he’ll grow out of it. I disagree, I think he’ll be 27 years old making his wife pretend to think he’s dead. Well, I won’t be apart of it. I plan on leaving the second I turn 18 and cutting off all contact with him. 

My mom makes me babysit often, I think she does it just so she doesn’t have to deal with him. Well, I don’t want to either. But I guess I have no choice like she does, since I don’t have a daughter I can force to babysit whenever I want. 

He’s in his room right now playing dead, he has been for an hour now. It pisses me off, I just want to scream at him, hit him, anything.

every time I walk past his room he’s in the same position as before, still pretending to be dead. 

I decided to let it go, I went to my room to watch YouTube, I didn’t leave for hours until I had to use the bathroom. And sure enough, there he was. Same position, pretending to be dead. I went up to him and started screaming, I screamed at him to stop. But he didn’t, he didn’t stop he didn’t even react. I get it.

He’s paying me back for what I did earlier, for when I shoved him to the ground. 

Or when I hit him over the head with a rock. God, I had to. I just had to. He wouldn’t stop crying about Mac n Cheese, and I just wanted him to stop.

But did I really deserve this? For him to lay in a puddle of fake blood, for him to pretend not to be breathing? For him to lay there, in that odd position with his eyes rolled into the back of head, did I?
