I still can’t believe she is gone. [My sister Laura, her friends, all drowned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17o761o/i_still_hear_the_footsteps_in_the_rain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) At least that was what we were told. We attended a funeral, but not all the bodies were recovered. Laura’s was gone but three of her friends were recovered. It gave some glimmer of hope that she was not dead, just missing. After a year though, it seemed unlikely she would be found. The area had been searched. We were told that divers went into the lake to try and find the missing ones, but no one could.

It was devastating for my family. But what I could not understand is what exactly happened. All we knew when she left was that Laura was going on a trip with her friends last year for spring break. It was a place in the mountains several hours away. The lake Kashur Resort and Spa. Apparently they had gone into the lake one night during a storm. They had allegedly been drunk and somehow each one of them had drowned. The proprietor of the place was unable to be reached for comment, but authorities said that all evidence pointed to a tragic accident.

Normally I would not have done anything but grieve for the loss of my sister, but then the letter arrived. It was from a man named Tim. He was the sole survivor of my sisters trip, he had an outlandish tale of impossible things that sounded like the delusional ravings of a person with survivors guilt.

The authorities' statement, predictably, clashed with his deranged ravings. They insisted it was a drunken swim party gone awry, resulting in an accidental death. But I never believed it, not about my sister. She was far too controlled to get intoxicated, and even if she had, she would never be so careless. Yet, the official investigation was stalled if not ended entirely.

The letter was genuinely disturbing, a cryptic tale from my sisters former friend,

"I can still hear their screams echoing in my mind. All of them. Adam and Gina were the first to fall, the splashing footsteps, swallowed by water, it was impossible. Yes, they drowned…but not in the lake. Laura, Becky, and I managed to reach the resort, the staff left us to fend for ourselves! Those things, the shapes, they followed us there.

They were in the rain, the lake, it was our fate, sealed and inescapable.

Forgive me, Becky, Laura. I tried, I really tried, but I was too late.

I am sending this to any of your family member who will listen.

I beg you, do not let them get away with this. They knew. They knew what would happen."

It was the creeping madness of that letter that made it seem like a fever dream, or a drug-induced delusion. Yet something in Tim's words, the raw terror that bled through his scrawled handwriting, made my skin crawl with a truth I couldn't explain. I put the letter away and departed.

I struggled with the decision to reach out to the man to verify the details of his story. I had sent a letter hoping for a response, yet he remained silent, and I lacked his contact number. I learned he had relocated to Nevada, and the idea of traveling such a distance just to confront him felt overwhelming. His statements to the police seemed too outlandish to take seriously, yet part of me couldn’t shake the nagging curiosity about the truth behind his claims.

I had to know for sure, so I made the decision.

I would go to Lake Kashur and try and find my sister or at least say goodbye to her at the last place she was seen.

The trip took nearly seven hours, rain pelting my windshield most of the way. Though gloomy, the drive was not unpleasant and the area was admittedly beautiful. The further I drove, the more isolated the roads became, until I was winding through dense forest on a single-lane road that didn't appear on my GPS.

My phone disconnected and reconnected for the tenth time before losing the signal completely.

Just when I began to think I'd made a terrible mistake, the trees parted, revealing Lake Kashur Resort and Spa. It looked impressive, though unpopulated. The main building, a sprawling three-story lodge with weathered cedar siding, boasted against a backdrop of fog-shrouded mountains. Several smaller cabins dotted the shoreline, their windows dark and uninviting.

The lake itself stretched vast and resplendent, its surface rippling despite the absence of wind. Though it was impressive and serene, something in the shifting waters made my skin crawl.

A sign on the road indicated: "Welcome to Lake Kashur - Where Memories Run Deep."

Someone had scratched something beneath it, but it looked like a thin layer of slap dash paint had been applied over it, trying to cover whatever message someone had attempted to carve into the sign.

I parked in the nearly empty lot, only a resort truck and a few cars were there. Pulling my jacket tighter against the chill, I grabbed my bag and headed to the entrance as the skies darkened and thunder rumbled. Inside, the dim lobby was lit by antique fixtures casting long shadows across the polished floors, and I moved toward the reception desk.

A rustling sound came from behind the reception desk before a woman appeared, her movements so suddenly I nearly jumped.

"Welcome to Lake Kashur," she said. "Do you have a reservation?"

"No, I was hoping to speak with someone about an accident that happened here last year."

She studied me for an uncomfortably long moment. "I am sorry we are not able to disclose details of any incidents that happened here to the press."

"Well no, I am a relative. My name is Connor, I'm here because my sister stayed here last spring. Laura Hanson? She would have been in a larger group of people visiting for spring break. Could I check the guest book?"

Something flickered across her face.

"I'll need to get the manager," she said abruptly, reaching for a phone beneath the counter. She turned away slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Mr. Dalton? There's a young man asking about an incident. Yes, last spring." She paused, listening. "Yes, sir. Right away."

She hung up and fixed that empty smile on me again. "Mr. Dalton will be right with you. Please wait just a moment."

Before I could respond, a tall figure emerged from a doorway I hadn't noticed before. He moved with unsettling grace for someone so gaunt, his impeccable suit hanging from his frame as if from a wire hanger.

"Gregory Dalton, proprietor of Lake Kashur Resort. I understand you have questions about your sister."

He gestured toward a seating area away from the desk. "Please, let's speak somewhere more comfortable."

I followed him to a pair of leather chairs positioned near a window overlooking the lake. The rain had intensified, drops streaking the glass like tears.

"Laura Hanson," he said, folding his hands in his lap. "Such a tragedy. I remember her vividly. Bright young woman. Studious. Not like the others in her group."

The way he described her was uncannily accurate. I leaned forward. "If I could be direct, what do you know about what really happened to her, Mr. Dalton? The official report says they drowned, but my sister was an excellent swimmer."

Dalton's eyes flicked toward the sound before returning to me.

"Rules exist for a reason, Mr. Hanson. Sometimes tragic ones." His voice lowered, almost hypnotic in its rhythm. "Your sister and her friends were warned, as all our guests are, that swimming during rainfall is strictly prohibited at Lake Kashur. A liability issue, you understand."

"That doesn't make sense. Why would rain make them drown? And if there was a rule, Laura wouldn't break it like that."

"Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator, even for the most disciplined among us." He sighed, a practiced sound of rehearsed regret. "They were young. Exuberant. Perhaps they thought our warnings were superstitious, many do."

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draft in the old building. "What exactly are you saying happened?"

"They went swimming during a storm much like this one." Dalton gestured toward the window. "The lake can be unpredictable. Currents shift. Temperatures drop suddenly. People lose track of how far out they swim and then, well…By the time our staff realized what was happening, it was too late."

The explanation, although hard to accept, was not entirely implausible. But still, something in his delivery felt hollow, like reciting lines from a well-rehearsed script. The pieces didn't fit. Tim's letter described something far more sinister than careless swimming.

Thunder echoed over the lake as Mr.Dalton glanced at the window. Rain poured down, churning the lake's surface. Before I could speak, Mr. Dalton interrupted,

"My sincerest condolences to you in this time of sorrow. Should you wish to remain with us for the night, I would be honored to have you stay. We have another group of young people here on break and you might enjoy their company. Besides, another tempest has arrived, and traveling amidst such torrential rain would be most perilous. Naturally, I shall provide full recompense for your night's stay, a mere token of solace in light of the profound loss of your dear sister."

I hesitated, the conflicting information warring in my mind. I could investigate further if I stayed, maybe even find some evidence about what really happened to Laura. On the other hand, every instinct screamed that something was deeply wrong with this place.

"That's very generous," I said carefully. "I think I will stay, just for the night, thank you."

"Excellent," Dalton replied, his thin lips stretching into what might have been a smile. "Room 217 should accommodate you nicely. It overlooks the lake and is close to…" He stopped himself. "Well, it has a splendid view."

Close to where Laura went missing. He didn't need to finish, I knew that guarded look and it made me even more suspicious of just what they were hiding here.

The receptionist arrived with a brass key marked 217. "Dinner is at seven," Dalton said, rising fluidly. "Feel free to explore, but stay indoors and avoid the lake while it rains, for safety."

"Of course," I agreed, accepting the key.

Dalton abruptly left, and a bellhop guided me to the second floor. The whole place had an eerie emptiness; only staff seemed to be lurking around.

The woman handed me the key and left without a word..

Inside, the room was tastefully furnished with slightly worn antique pieces, a queen bed, a writing desk by the window, and a newly renovated bathroom. The view, described as splendid, showed only a rain-beaten lake and a mist-obscured inlet. I wondered if that was where Laura went into the water?

I considered Tim's letter again. How he mentioned "shapes in the rain" and "footsteps splashing on the ground." At the time, I'd dismissed it as trauma-induced hallucinations, but now, staring at the churning lake, I wasn't so sure.

The rain intensified, drumming against the window with an almost deliberate rhythm. Thunder cracked overhead, and for a split second, I thought I saw something move beneath the lake's surface, a pale, elongated shape that wasn't there when I looked again.

The floor outside my room creaked. I froze and listened. Then I heard a shuffling sound, followed by what sounded like water dripping onto the carpet. Not the usual footsteps of someone passing by, but something different, heavier.

I crept to the door, pressing my ear against it. The dripping sound continued, followed by a strange, wet rasp like someone struggling to breathe through fluid. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob.

Suddenly a soft gurgling voice spoke to me, it sounded like a voice trying to speak underwater.

“You…need to leave. Not…safe, they come tonight, the sacrifice is prepared. They will awaken, and all must drown who still draw breath here…”

I was paralyzed with fear at the ominous warning and before I could turn the door handle and confront the mysterious voice, the sounds receded down the hallway, fading into silence. I exhaled shakily, backing away from the door. I had no idea what the hell was going on there.

I sat in confusion as a flash of lightning illuminated the room one final time,then nothing. The rain drumming on the window abruptly ceased. The sudden silence was almost more unnerving than the storm had been.

I approached the window cautiously. Outside, the transformation was startling. The lake had become a perfect mirror, reflecting the clearing sky with such precision it was difficult to discern where water ended and air began. Not a single ripple disturbed its glassy surface. The mist had vanished, revealing the entirety of the shoreline in crystalline detail.

I had heard enough, something was very wrong here and I knew it was a mistake to have come at all. I checked my phone and saw it was 6:45 PM. Dinner would be served soon, the distraction might offer some cover for getting out of there.

I slipped outside and rushed to the parking lot. To my horror I saw that all four tires of my car were now flat. Someone had deliberately slashed the tires, intending to strand me.

My mind raced and despite my first instinct, I paused. I considered it must be Mr. Dalton, had he wanted to keep me here for whatever he was planning? I was alone and unarmed though, so I would not confront now, I just needed to leave. My heart pounded as I backed away from the car, considering the mile or two walk back to the highway. Just then, I heard laughter and chatter near the main building, the other guests Dalton mentioned. Relieved, I followed the voices to a courtyard, where five people in swimsuits stood with drinks in hand.

They were heading to the lake despite the approaching darkness and recent rain. I figured they might be able to help me get out of there, so I followed them and discovered a small cove, partially hidden by rocks, just as Tim described. A weathered wooden dock stretched twenty feet into the water. Had Laura stood here before she vanished?

As I moved toward the dock I saw the sign, bold red and indicating,

“Absolutely no swimming in the rain!”

They were very serious about that rule, and yet not much effort to enforce it if people just came out here and it started to rain.

The group of swimmers were making their way down the path toward the dock, their voices carrying clearly across the still night air.

"Dude, this place is amazing," one of the guys said, his arm slung around a girl's shoulders. "Totally worth the price of this place."

"I still can't believe we have the whole resort practically to ourselves," another girl replied, her blonde hair catching the moonlight.

"The old guy said swimming during bad weather is not recommended," one of the taller guys said, mimicking Dalton's formal cadence. "But what he doesn't know won't hurt him."

"I don't know, guys," a brunette girl hesitated, hugging herself. "Did you see how he looked at us when Jake asked about swimming? It was creepy. For all we know they have hidden cameras or something."

"Come on, Melissa," the guy with his arm around her urged. "The rain stopped. It's perfect out. When will we ever get another chance like this? It's gorgeous out!"

The group stopped abruptly when they spotted me. An awkward silence fell over them.

"Hey creep what the hell?" One of the guys called out. "You work here or something?"

I realized they were talking to me as I was watching them from the tree line. I shook my head, stepping back toward the shore. "No. Just a guest, like you."

They visibly relaxed, though the brunette, Melissa still eyed me with suspicion.

"Sweet," said the guy who seemed to be the leader. "We're just gonna take a quick dip. You won't tell the staff, right?"

I hesitated. These were just college kids looking to have fun, exactly like Laura and her friends had been.

"I don't think that's a good idea," I said, surprising myself with the firmness in my voice. "There was an accident here last year. People died. Listen, I think we need to leave, there’s something wrong with the people who work here, something’s off. Someone slashed my tires and I heard something about a sacrifice."

The group exchanged glances. After a pause, several of them burst into laughter.

"A sacrifice? Seriously? Did the old man put you up to this? What's next, a hook-handed killer who preys on couples making out?"

"I'm serious," I insisted, stepping closer. "My sister was here last year. She drowned in this lake with her friends. The only survivor sent me a letter about things in the lake that came out when it rained. Please, just listen to me."

My desperation must have shown through because some of their smiles faltered. Melissa bit her lip. "Maybe we should go back. I didn't like the vibe of this place anyway."

"Oh come on!" the other girl exclaimed. "We paid good money for this weekend. I'm not letting some random dude with a sob story ruin it."

"Look, I'm not trying to scare you," I said. "But something's not right here. The manager, the staff, they're hiding something. And my tires…"

"Your tires probably got punctured on the crappy road getting here," Jake interrupted. "Happens all the time in these backwoods places."

Thunder rumbled in the distance, a sound that made my blood run cold despite the clear sky above us.

"Weather's turning again," the tall guy noted, glancing at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering with unnatural speed. "Maybe we should head in, just for a bit."

Jake shook his head stubbornly. "One quick dip. We'll be back before the rain hits."

Before I could protest further, he was sprinting down the dock, the others following with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Jake dove in with a splash, followed by two others. Melissa and the tall guy hung back, watching from the edge.

"Come on, it feels amazing!" Jake called, treading water.

I took a step back as The sky darkened with impossible speed. One moment clear, the next churning with black clouds. The distant thunder wasn't distant anymore, it cracked directly overhead, making the dock vibrate beneath my feet. The first drops fell,

"Jake, seriously, let's go!" Melissa called, backing away from the edge. But something was happening to the lake. Where it had been glass-smooth moments before, now the surface rippled oddly, not from the rain or the swimmers, but from below. Concentric circles formed around the three in the water, as if something was rising toward them.

"You guys need to get out now!" I yelled.

They reached the shore and were panting, but all okay apparently. They looked to each other and then the lake and started laughing.

“Ah man, nothing happened. Thought the Loch Ness Monster would come out to play or something with all the build up.” They continued laughing with only the girl named Melissa grimacing and looking around nervously. I watched the lake as the rain intensified and was disturbed by how the water began to roil, less like a lake more like an angry ocean.

The lake's surface began to churn violently, waves forming where there had been none before. The rain suddenly intensified, shifting from a gentle patter to a downpour in seconds.

A light in the distance cut through the darkness from somewhere behind me, sweeping across the shoreline. I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the powerful beam briefly illuminated me, casting my shadow long and distorted across the lake. The light was impossibly bright, like a searchlight but stronger, scanning methodically across the water's surface. Two sharp, piercing whistles sliced through the air, mechanical, like an old steam engine announcing its arrival. The sound echoed across the lake, reverberating in my chest.

"What the hell is that?" one of the guys shouted, pointing toward the source of the light.

I turned to look, but the beam had already moved on, now sweeping across the turbulent surface of the lake. In its path, I could see something disturbing the water, not waves, but shapes moving beneath the surface, pale and elongated.

The group scrambled away from the shore, grabbing their belongings in a hurry. Through the increasing downpour, I noticed movement on the resort's main driveway, headlights cutting through the rain as several vehicles pulled away from the lodge, fleeing in haste.

"They're leaving us," I whispered, a cold dread settling in my stomach. "The staff is evacuating, they know something is going to happen." I considered the mysterious words about a sacrifice and my heart sank.

Before anyone could process what was happening, a red pickup truck with flashing emergency lights lurched down the path toward our position, its tires spraying mud and gravel. It skidded to a halt at the edge of the cove, and the driver's door swung open.

Mr. Dalton emerged, no longer the composed proprietor but a man possessed. His thin hair was plastered to his skull, his expensive suit soaked through. In his hand was something that looked like an antique lantern, its blue flame impossibly bright despite the rain.

"It happens faster every year, as if your cohort becomes increasingly less intelligent," he sneered with a chilling chuckle. "Simple rules for simple minds. Honestly, if we made a rule stating that you would die if you didn't swim in the rain, your contrarian nature would probably guarantee that the Drowned ones would never wake again. Yet, here we find ourselves." His eyes glinted with a sinister amusement as he sighed deeply, "I fear you're all fresh out of luck."

I couldn't process his words at first, they were too crazy, too detached from reality. But the cold calculation in his eyes told me this wasn't madness. It was something worse.

"What do you mean 'fresh out of luck'?" the group's leader Jake demanded, stepping forward. "What the hell is going on?"

Dalton ignored the chaos, focusing on me. "You should've stayed in your room, Mr. Hanson. The lake is off-limits during rain, as I warned. Now you'll see what happened to your sister. The cycle continues. The lake must be fed. Die well." With that, the truck sped off.

Terrible splashing footsteps echoed on the ground by the shore, like something heavy emerging, yet nothing was visible. Everyone froze in fear. Suddenly, a scream pierced the night, cut short as a girl was dragged across the wet ground, clawing at the earth. An unseen force, rain turned solid, pulled her toward the water.

"Help me!" she cried, terror in her voice. Two men lunged, grabbing her wrists, forming a grim tug-of-war against the invisible pull.

"Don't let go!" she sobbed, her eyes wild with fear.

But something was wrong with the rain where it touched her skin. It wasn't running off but collecting, thickening, taking form. Pale, elongated fingers materialized from the raindrops themselves, clutching at her legs, her waist, multiplying with each passing second.

Soon her scream was smothered by a rush of water forming from nothing over her head, drowning her on the edge of the water.

In the next moment the girl's body was pulled free from her attempted rescuers and she was yanked backward with impossible force. She didn't even have time to scream again before she was submerged, the lake swallowing her whole without a splash, as if she'd never existed at all.

"Jenny!" her friends screamed in unison.

The remaining swimmers stood on the shore, their panicked screams barely audible over the hammering rain. I stood frozen, processing the horror of the situation. This was what happened to my sister. It wasn't an accident. It was a sacrifice.

"Run!" I shouted to the others, finally breaking free of my paralysis. "Get away from the water!"

But it was too late. The rain itself seemed to come alive, droplets coalescing mid-air into translucent shapes. One man was pulled off his feet by invisible forces, dragged through the mud as he screamed and clawed at the earth. Clinging to a tree trunk, his grip failed as rain shaped into fingers pried him loose.

"We have to get to the lodge!" I yelled.

We sprinted through the rain, surrounded by translucent figures with featureless faces, water streaming from their elongated limbs as they moved toward us unnaturally. The lodge loomed ahead, dark and imposing against the storm-wracked sky. The front entrance stood partially open, swinging lazily in the wind. Not a single light burned inside.

"They're gone," the tall guy panted as we raced up the steps. "Everyone's gone."

We burst through the doors into the cavernous lobby. The reception desk was abandoned, drawers hanging open as if someone had left in a hurry. The elegant furniture that had seemed so welcoming earlier now cast grotesque shadows in the dim emergency lighting.

"We need to barricade the doors," I gasped, already shoving a heavy armchair toward the entrance. Melissa and the tall guy joined me, dragging a coffee table and an antique bench to block the way.

"I've got my car," Jake said suddenly, fumbling for his keys. "It's right out front. If I can get to it, we can drive out of here!" His eyes were wild with a desperate hope. "I'll bring it around to the door. Be ready to jump in!"

Before I could stop him, he bolted toward a side exit, keys clutched in his trembling hand.

"Wait!" I called after him, but he was already gone, the door slamming shut behind him.

Melissa and I pressed our faces to the window, watching as he sprinted through the downpour toward a blue sedan parked near the front steps. Splashing footsteps in the rain were appearing all around the building and parking lot with each passing second.

"Come on, come on," Melissa whispered, her breath fogging the glass.

The rain intensified and it became difficult to see anything outside. We pressed our ears to the glass and then recoiled when a disturbing scratching sound was heard on the other side of the door. It was followed by a voice out of a nightmare,

"Please... let us in," came a wet, gurgling voice from the other side of the door. The sound was unmistakably human yet horribly distorted, as if the speaker's lungs were filled with fluid. "It's me... Jenny. I'm so cold... I can't breathe out here."

Melissa stumbled backward, her hand flying to her mouth. "That's her voice," she whispered. "Oh God, that's Jenny's voice."

"Help me," the voice pleaded, higher now, desperate. "I'm drowning... please... it hurts so much."

Water began seeping under the door, not in the usual way rain might trickle in, but purposefully, gathering into a puddle that crept across the floor toward us.

"Don't listen," I hissed, pulling Melissa farther back. "That's not Jenny. Your friend is gone."

A second voice joined the first, this one deeper but equally waterlogged. "Sam... please... open the door. I can't... hold on much longer." The voice choked and sputtered. "The water... it's filling my lungs."

"Matt?" Melissa whispered, her face ashen. She took an involuntary step forward before I grabbed her arm.

"It's not them," I insisted, though my voice trembled. "It's whatever took them. The same thing that took my sister."

The frantic scratching grew louder against the walls and door. Tears streamed down Melisa's cheeks as she sobbed into her hands. Beside her, Sam gently comforted her with a soothing voice and embrace. Distracted by the unearthly voices pleading to be let in, we missed what was happening outside. Jake reached his car, the engine roared, and headlights pierced the darkness as he reversed.

For a moment, hope surged within me. The sedan backed up rapidly, aiming for the lodge entrance. If he could get close enough, we could make a run for it.

But something was wrong. The car was moving too fast, careening backward at a speed that suggested panic rather than control. Through the rain-streaked windshield, I could see the Jake was wrestling with the steering wheel, his face contorted in terror.

"Something's in there with him," I realized aloud, just as the sedan crashed through the barricade we'd erected, splintering the wooden barricade and shattering the lobby doors. Glass and splinters exploded across the marble floor as the vehicle smashed halfway into the building before grinding to a halt, its rear wheels still spinning.

"Jake!" Melissa screamed, but her voice died in her throat as we saw what was happening inside the car.

The interior was filled with water, impossibly contained within the vehicle like an aquarium. Jake thrashed within, his mouth open in a silent scream, bubbles escaping his lips as he pounded against the windows. His eyes bulged, pleading for help we couldn't provide.

And then I saw them, the pale, elongated figures sharing the flooded car with him, their translucent hands wrapped around his throat, his ankles, his wrists. One of them turned toward us, a faceless head composed entirely of water, and I swear I saw a smile ripple across its featureless visage.

But worse than the horror inside the car was what was happening behind it. The rain creatures were flowing in through the shattered entrance, seeping around the sedan's frame and reforming inside the lobby. They moved with terrible purpose, water flowing upward against gravity to shape humanoid figures with long, reaching arms.

"Upstairs!" I grabbed Melissa and Sam, yanking them toward the grand staircase. "We need to get higher!"

We frantically clambered up the steps, the relentless splashing footsteps echoing behind us with a chilling consistency, never hastening or faltering, as inevitable and inescapable as death itself.

We reached the second floor landing, gasping for breath. The hallway stretched before us, doors lining both sides. Some stood ajar, inviting us into their deceptive safety.

"My room," I panted, pointing down the corridor. "217. We can barricade ourselves in there."

A flash of lightning illuminated the hallway through a large window at the end of the corridor. To my horror, the window was wide open, rain pouring in freely. The water wasn't behaving naturally , instead of simply splashing onto the floor, it gathered in midair, coalescing into those same terrible forms we'd seen outside.

"They're already inside," Melissa whispered, her voice breaking.

We looked behind us to see more water creatures ascending the stairs, their movements fluid yet somehow wrong, like stop-motion animation played at the wrong speed.

"Run!" I shouted, pulling Melissa toward my room. Sam sprinted ahead of us, but as we passed the open window, a watery tendril shot out, wrapping around his ankle. He stumbled, crashing to the carpet.

"Help!" he screamed, fingers clawing at the hallway runner as the tendril began dragging him back toward the window. I lunged for his outstretched hand, our fingers brushing for a split second before he was yanked away with impossible force.

"Sam!" Melissa shrieked as he was pulled toward the open window, more tendrils materializing from the rain to envelop his body. His scream transformed into a choking gurgle as his head disappeared beneath the watery surface.

"We can't help him!" I shouted, watching in horror as Sam's struggling form was enveloped in water that seemed to materialize from nowhere, covering him.

We made it to her room and slammed and locked the door. I ensured the windows were closed and barricaded the door. We sat in terrified silence as the horrifying sounds of the things outside pressed inwards.

Melissa collapsed onto the floor, trembling and sobbing uncontrollably as the reality of what had happened to her friends sank in. I checked the bathroom for any water source, relieved to find the taps dry when I turned them. Small mercies.

"What are those things?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding rain outside. "This can't be happening."

The scratching began at our door, soft at first, then more insistent. Water seeped beneath the doorframe, forming a small puddle that began to grow despite our attempts to block it with towels.

The voices called, a horrible chorus of drowned friends. "We found something amazing in the lake. You have to see it. Please let us in."

Melissa pressed her hands over her ears, rocking back and forth. "Make it stop," she begged. "Please make it stop."

We waited, helpless in the room for what felt like hours. None of the things got in, but we could not get out. Then the sound of the rain stopped. The ghoulish voices begging us to let them in stopped as well.

It was the rain! I remembered what the letter said, they came with the rain. We had to take our chance and leave now.

"We're leaving," I said, my voice stronger than I felt. "Now."

Melissa looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes. "But what if they're waiting? What if..."

"If we stay here, we die," I cut her off, gripping her shoulders. "The rain's stopped. Those things... they come with the rain. That's what happened to my sister."

I moved to the window and peered outside. The storm had broken The lake gleamed under the dull shades of the coming dawn.

"We need to get to a car," I said. "Any car."

"Jake's is still downstairs," Melissa whispered, pushing herself to her feet. Her face was pale but determined.

We crept to the door, listening for any sounds beyond. Nothing but silence greeted us. I turned the handle slowly, wincing at the slight creak as the door swung open. The hallway was empty. Not just of water creatures, but of any trace they'd been there at all.

We moved cautiously down the stairwell.

"I don't understand," Melissa whispered as we reached the first floor. "How can everything be normal?"

The lobby told a different story. Jake's car remained half-embedded in the shattered entrance, a grim reminder that not everything had been reset. But the vehicle was empty, no water, no Jake, just the keys still dangling from the ignition.

"Let's go," I said, moving toward the car.

Melissa hesitated. "Shouldn't we look for the others? Maybe they're still alive somewhere."

I shook my head, remembering Laura, remembering Tim's letter. "They're gone. If we stay, we'll be gone too."

The car's engine sputtered to life on the first try. I reversed it carefully over the broken glass and splintered wood. As we pulled away from the lodge, I glanced in the rearview mirror. The building loomed dark and silent, its windows reflecting the faint light of the rising sun like empty eyes. We drove down the winding road through the forest, both too traumatized to speak at first.

"I'm so sorry about your sister," Melissa finally said, her voice small in the confined space

I nodded absently, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. "I just wish I knew what really happened to her. If those things took her like they took your friends."

The words died in my throat as a single drop of water hit the windshield. Then another. And another.

"No," Melissa whispered, her eyes widening in terror. "Not again."

Rain began to pelt the car, increasing in intensity with unnatural speed. I pressed my foot to the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward on the narrow road.

"Faster!" Melissa urged, twisting in her seat to look behind us.

I heard it then, the unmistakable sound of splashing footsteps keeping pace with the car. Not on the road, but somehow beside us, within the curtain of rain itself.

"Connor…"

My blood froze. It was Laura's voice, clear as day, coming from just outside my window.

"Connor, why are you leaving me?" The voice was perfectly my sister's, yet horribly distorted, as if she were speaking through water. "I've been so alone."

"Don't listen," Melissa warned, her hands pressed against her ears. "It's not her."

But I couldn't help myself. I glanced toward my window and saw a pale face formed in the rain, Laura's face, her features rippling and flowing but unmistakably hers. Water streamed from her hair, her eyes, her mouth as she clung to the car, impossible yet undeniable.

"Please, Connor…I'm drowning…help me." Her watery fingers pressed against the glass, leaving no marks yet somehow I could feel the chill of her touch through the window.

I swerved, nearly sending us off the road. The tires skidded on the wet asphalt as I struggled to keep control.

"Don't look at it!" Melissa screamed, but her eyes were fixed on her own window where Matt's face had formed in the rain, his features twisted in agony.

The windshield wipers worked frantically, slicing through the apparitions only for them to reform instantly. Laura's voice grew more desperate, more insistent.

"You promised you'd always protect me…why did you leave me here? I'm so cold…so dark under the water."

My chest constricted with grief and guilt. "I'm sorry," I whispered, tears blurring my vision. "I'm so sorry, Laura."

"Pull over," her voice coaxed, sweet and terrible. "Just stop the car. Let me in. We can be together again."

For a heartbeat, my foot hovered over the brake pedal. The longing to see my sister again, to speak with her one last time, was overwhelming.

"Connor, don't!" Melissa's hand clamped down on my arm. "It's not her! Remember what happened to the others!"

The spell broke. I stomped on the accelerator and eventually the voices receded as well as the rain.

My sister was gone, what was left there was not her. Melissa and I made our way back to what we believed was safety, but I recalled Tim and his survival and realized we would never really be safe again. Those creatures had marked us, and they would relentlessly pursue us. The rain, once a simple part of nature, had transformed into a constant harbinger of our impending doom.

That was all two months ago. Melissa and I stayed in touch after our escape from Lake Kashur, bound by a trauma no one else could understand. The official report blamed a flash flood that claimed her friends, another tragic accident like Laura’s.

I tried to explain what really happened, rain forming into people, drowned voices, and a proprietor who fled, leaving his guests as sacrifices, but it sounded insane. They offered grief counseling and quietly closed the case.

I’ve spent hours researching Lake Kashur. Ownership records reveal a history of “tragic accidents,” yet Gregory Dalton’s name is missing, as if he never existed. The most disturbing find was a 1937 newspaper clipping showing Dalton at the resort’s opening ceremony, unchanged by time, looking exactly like he did when I saw him in person.

I had no idea who or what he really is and I don’t know if I will ever know.

Tonight, it is raining again. Even with the blinds drawn, I hear the voices, splashing footsteps, and fingernails scratching at the glass. Melissa calls these episodes “hauntings”, fitting since the dead spirits will never give us peace.

Now, as the relentless rain pounds on every sealed entry, my phone buzzes. Melissa whispers, “They’re outside my building, I can hear them calling, Matt, Jenny, everyone.” I tell her to stay put and follow our safety plan. Even so, the hauntings grow more relentless, and I fear I may not last much longer. I fear I will never be free, from this drowning cycle of death.
