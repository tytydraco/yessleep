Your probably wondering why Im writing this. A girl went crazy and killed herself due to the pressure of her job, and left a mystery note. I fear I will be following in her footsteps soon.

I, 45F spent 26 years on a job at NASA as an 
assistant pharmacist. Strange job considering I work for NASA, but their employees (espcially the astronauts) need to be at peak health. 5 years into the job I met Haley. Haley was one of NASA's top engineers, working on rockets and devices to be sent to mars. We got along well, both of us near the same age and liking to talk of scientific advances.

During one of these conversations, we were interupted by one of Haleys senior collegues. "Haley. I need a word with you." He murmured. This was a common occurance. "Haley. Its important. Come to sector 4Q." I bolted up right, and Haleys eyes shimmered. Sector 4Q was off limits, only those with extremely high clearance got in there. Maybe they had made a new discovery? "I'll catch you later, send my meds to my office!" She called in her annoyingly sing song ish voice. I nodded and waved, returning to the counter.

I didnt see Haley for 3 days. It was like she never left the sector; there was only one way in and out and that went past the pharmacy. When I finally spotted her I was closing up and preparing to go see my Uncle, also an avid NASA enthusist. "Haley! Where have you been-" 

No. I pause. I look more closely- her face is blank and pale, her typically flushed face replaced with a solem gaze. It was unerving "Izzy?" She eventually turned to look at me from across the corridoor and I exclaimed "What happend? Are you alright? You look horrible.." Haley turned and carried on walking, slouched over and feet dragging. Her demenor was completly transformed. 

A month passed, Haley continued her work in sector 4Q. An eerie quiet fell upon the unit and pharmacy as the life she once brang faded away into her new ever worsening state. Zombie like. Her face slowly stretching into a horrified gaze; the next day, when I saw her I cried "Haley!" No reply. "Haley lets talk, please-" 

"No. They'll kill you too. We are all dead." "...what?" I shivered. Her voice lowered "Im next, i know it. Why did he bring me in there.." I pause "Haley your scaring me!"

"YOU SHOULD BE SCARED! RUN! THEY'LL KILL YOU, YOUR ALL DEAD, YOUR A DEAD WOMEN WALKING IZZY!" She lunged, grabbibg my neck and we topple onto the floor smashing my head on the ground. The pharmacy waiting area fills with screams of terror, and Haley begins sobbing as I gasp for air. What the fucks going on? Haley, my calm and intelligent friend of 21 years is mid breakdown crawling away from me and clawing at her eyes and face.

All i could do was watch as she was dragged away by security. She killed herself that same day.

Your probably wondering why Im writing this. A girl went crazy and killed herself due to the pressure of her job, and left a mystery note. Well, I'll tell you. Because I fear I will be following in her footsteps soon. I found the note in her pill jar when cleaning out her office with my uncle. She had no other relatives to do it. It read two lines, 2 lines that made me heave in absolute horror.

"Izzy, sector 4Q has been breached. All of NASA's capative lifeforms, aliens, are on the loose." 

"RUN."
