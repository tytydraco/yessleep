It was supposed to be the safest time of month. Seriously, there’s only a small window every 28 days or so when any risk exists, and I was at the furthest point from it. 

That’s how I found myself in the rural space between San Antonio and Austin a few weeks ago, traipsing with my tripod and praying to whatever deity that would listen for a break in the clouds.

“Just hang out at the campsite,” Mitch had told me as he cracked another Rolling Rock. “We can still kind of see the eclipse when it’s cloudy.”

“I didn’t buy a $1,913 Nikon Z9 for ‘kind of’,” I answered as I packed up my Corolla. “I’ll follow the sun.”

So I left behind the friends who had driven with me to Texas and headed out alone, desperate for some solar clarity. I’d been waiting seven years for this, and didn’t want it ruined.

Which is why I pulled off the road and climbed through a field that seemed to be entirely composed of thorns and bugs. I’m sorry I messed with you, Texas, but what the fuck. Anyway, I was out by myself in the middle of nowhere, which is how all intelligent decisions start, when I heard it behind me. 

I had no desire to turn around, of course, because I had finally almost sort of gotten a good angle of the eclipsing sun in an extremely narrow patch between the clouds.

Then it happened. I still get chills thinking about it. I experienced nighttime at 1:30 p. m. By myself in the field, I looked around at the world I thought I knew and I saw something different. Heart pounding, I peered into the lens and took as many pictures of totality as I could. 

The sounds behind me got louder at that point, but I wasn’t about to look back. I’d driven from L. A. for this. Totality would only be a few minutes. I just didn’t have time.

But the noises got closer. Something was moving toward me in this field that I had thought was abandoned. Heart beating faster, I kept my eyes on the lens, not wanting to miss a second. I told myself that I wasn’t afraid.

I was lying. What was creeping up behind me in the dark? At this point, I was more afraid of seeing it than anything else, but I told myself that I couldn’t look and miss even a single second of the solar event. 

It got closer. I ignored it.

Then its hot breath steamed my neck.

I whipped around and stared at my sunny darkness intruder, ready to attack with my tripod. 

Have you ever seen something so perfectly horrible that you can only feel removed from the situation and awestruck? That’s how I felt when the wolf-that-wasn’t-a-wolf-because-it-was-bipedal-and-six-feet-tall leered down at me, his jaw and tongue dripping low with hunger. 

I fought hard against the need to pass out then and there. I understood immediately that I would be devoured for certain if unconscious, but only very probably if I stayed awake, so I focused on remaining upright. You’ve never really been afraid until you truly think you’re going to die. 

I tried to run. That immediately failed as the anthropomorphic wolf pounced. I hit the ground hard and saw stars. My head spun with pain.

My dwindling thought was that at least the skies had lined up to see me off.

Then it got brighter. The wolf paused an inch from my chest, his wet nostrils flaring, staring at me with human eyes. He opened his mouth and lowered it to my shoulder. 

It got brighter still. The eclipse was ending as he brushed up against my skin.

I held my breath, completely frozen.

He opened his mouth right as another break in the clouds brought the sun powerfully back. I braced for pain in my chest, but that was overridden by the agony in my ears as the wolf howled loud enough to be heard back in San Antonio.

I was powerless to stop him, and lacked any credit for the fact that he sprinted as far from me as he could get. I never saw him again.

“Did you get any good pictures of it?” Mitch asked. He let out an enormous belch.

“Huh?” I asked, my voice shaking as I threw all my camping gear into the Corolla without bothering to bag or organize it.

“You chased that eclipse into a God-forsaken field. I hope it was worth it.”

I slammed my trunk and spun on him, shaking from head to foot. “Don’t you *ever* talk to me about what’s God-forsaken,” I spat.

He stared back at me, one eyebrow raised. “Okay, man, geez. Just asking.” He folded his arms. “What’s eating you?”

Totality was on April 8th. A solar eclipse can only happen on a New Moon. 

I’ve been working very hard at trying to forget it ever since then. But it’s very, very difficult to forget something when you’re working hard at it. 

I thought I was almost there. I was eventually able to sleep through the night without waking up in a cold sweat. 

But over the past couple of days, it’s been getting worse. It started as an itch. Now there’s a fiery pain in my shoulder that feels like it’s building into something bad. I tried to ignore it, which is of course brilliant advice for any medical condition. It can either get better or worse, right? That makes a 50-50 chance. 

Then it got more painful, and I wondered what the worst could possibly be. 

That’s when I thought to look at a calendar.

It makes no sense, of course. But none of what happened to me does.

We’re a week away from the next new moon. It’s the exact opposite point in time from a full moon. 

Exactly when I’d least expect an attack. 

I don’t know what to do. I’ve been in denial of the fact that it’s getting more difficult to handle silver, or my sudden craving for very rare steaks. I can’t handle another week of this.

Especially if it’s going to get worse.

Which forces me to ask the question:

After the new moon arrives, [what then](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/)?
