As the plane roared on its path through the skies, I finally gave up trying to catch forty winks while on the way.

Oh, remember that Aurora went to Istanbul? Well, readers, we had to go as well to somehow stop her.

Ah, fun times.

Next to me, meanwhile, Raj and Diana had been napping for the better part of a few hours, eyes covered with an eye mask. Which left the only person still awake…

“Hey Sam”, I whispered. “Can’t sleep?”

Nodding, he replied, “Yeah. I… just have a lot going on in my head right now.”

Truth be told, he did seem to be somewhat troubled. I figured that then would be the best time to figure out what was troubling him.

“Oh, that’s terrible. What is troubling you at this point?”

“It’s just… I don’t really do well in conflict situations nowadays. I hate how it sounds and feels, and brings back… a lot of traumatic experiences.” 

“Why do you feel so?”, I asked, deciding to probe further.

“I haven’t told any of you about this, but I used to serve in the army. I was deployed in Iraq, in fact, from 2003 to 2009. The things I’ve had to do… the things I’ve seen… I never wanted to experience any of that again. But yet, here I am…”, he trailed off.

“It’s fine, you don’t have to talk about this if you don’t want to”, I reassured him. In reality, I had no idea how to respond, as this revelation about his life most certainly was a bombshell.

“No, it’s fine. I trust you. I’ve seen a great many things. I’ve seen my fellow soldiers, who I considered my brothers, get blown to bits in front of me. I’ve seen innocent civilians get massacred, just for existing and being in the wrong place. No matter how much I try to forget, adjust to normal society, bury myself in my work… I can never leave my past. Sometimes… I wonder. Why am I alive and they dead? I could have tried to save them…”

“That’s terrible. But remember, it’s not your fault. After that, have you ever tried therapy? To help you deal with your problems?”

“Nope, I didn’t think it would help me much back then. You’re a psychologist, right?”

“Nope. Close enough, but I’m a neurologist. I could help you out a little bit, though we don’t have much time.”, I responded.

“Thanks. The thing is…”, he paused. “I’m tired of losing. Losing people close to me, losing years of my life. I really don’t want to do this again.”

“Sam, don’t lose hope. This is our duty. We must do this, for the good of the world. The responsibility is ours alone. What would happen if Aurora was left unstopped? We should not lose!”, I responded, trying to motivate him.

“When you put it that way… you’re not wrong. What else can we do?”, he said, before barking out a laugh.

After that, the ride mostly passed in silence without any further discussion. He did not seem to want to pour out more problems, despite my prompting. Eventually, the plane skidded to a halt on the tarmac of Istanbul Airport. Diana and Sam, too, awoke from their slumber. Luckily, since the flight was a red-eye flight, we managed to arrive when it was broad daylight. That time, just like the last city, we opted to quickly dump our bags in a nearby hotel. After which, we began searching for Aurora with the trusty tracker again.

“It’s freezing out here!”, I commented as I slipped on my jacket. I didn’t expect Istanbul to be that cold, even if it was December.

“So, where is Aurora again?” Sam asked.

Peering at our tracker, Diana said, “She’s been running around the city throughout the night, but now she’s stopping at a neighbourhood on the outskirts of the city.”

“That can’t be good,'' Raj commented. “Margaret?”

“Yes?”, I asked, perking up.

“Go to this address here, we’ll start there.”

As we sped past the greenery between the airport and Istanbul in the company car, we discussed our strategy to finish Aurora.

“So, once we get near her, we’ll get on foot in pairs or as a group. We’ll search for her, and fire at will as soon as we see her and have a clear shot. So keep your eyes peeled, got it?”

“So, will we be ending her, then?”, I asked.

Diana didn’t respond.

“Diana?”, I prompted. “Will we be ending her?”

“...Yes. We will be using the real bullets this time.”, she replied hesitantly.

Eventually, we drove into an urban neighbourhood and navigated the side roads, going deeper and deeper into the city. Finally, we noticed that we were a few streets away from Aurora’s purported location.

“Stop here!” Diana exclaimed. “This is around where she is.”

Immediately, I parked the car at the side of the road and we disembarked the vehicle.

As she seemed to be standing on the same road for the past hour or so, we decided to simply head there and find her. However, as we rounded a corner, we heard a few people conversing nearby. Immediately, Raj held a palm up, and we stopped and listened.

“If you need anything, just come back here, alright?”, a woman said.

“Alright, I will! Thanks for your help!” Aurora's high-pitched voice rang out. 

“No problem, dear!”

“That has to be her”, Raj grumbled. 

“We should go now, then!”, I whispered.

“Alright. Let’s go! Now!”

We didn’t have to be asked twice. Immediately, we rushed into the narrow alley and upon seeing Aurora, emptied our entire clip at her as she turned to us in shock.

And for once, although not all the bullets hit her, we struck true. From the entrance of their house, two people, a man and a woman stood transfixed as light grey liquid began seeping from her midriff and shoulder.

“So, you’ve seen too much.”, she softly stated as she approached them. The woman began to shy away from the approaching Aurora.

“Die then!”, she snarled. She took a piece of wood that lay on the side of the road and slammed it hard on the woman’s head with a thud. The woman immediately fell to the ground like a sack of bricks and lay there, dead.

“How could you do this!”, the man screamed at Aurora. “We fed you! We hel-”

He, too, met the same fate as the woman, getting decked hard in the back of the head. He, too, did not survive.

“Ah, red. It’s always been my favourite colour!”, Aurora commented as they bled out on the tarmac.

“What the hell Aurora!” Raj yelled.

She took a few steps towards us, and looked up and down at her injured, bleeding body (yes, the liquid is like blood for her body). “And you people! You’ll pay for this!”, she snarled angrily at us. “They deserved it anyways, they let me in!”

“Whatever. Reload and fire, now!” I ordered everyone. Truth be told, after my last encounter with her, I really disliked listening to her monologues.

Just then, a boy came out of the house. He was quite young, possibly not older than eight.

“Anne, baba?”, he whispered, shaking the bodies of his parents who were just murdered by Aurora.

“Don’t shoot! Stop her!” Raj yelled as Aurora raised her heel.

But it was too late. She stomped on the boy’s neck with a sickening crack, causing it to be twisted in an odd angle. He fell to the ground as life drained out of his eyes.

As we raised our guns up, ready to fire again, Aurora turned back to us. 

“You’re done for!”, she threatened. She reached for a nearby bag, and threw some sort of kitchen utensil at us. A pressure cooker, maybe? In the second it flew towards us, Sam stared at it in shock.

“It… it’s a…”, he muttered, but I never heard what he said afterwards, for it exploded with a blinding fiery cloud! The shockwave threw me back straight to the other side of the alley, and shrapnel stung my face and body. While my head was spinning from the shock of the explosion, I was still semi-conscious. A minute later, when I found the energy to get up, all I could see was thick black smoke, the wrecked remains of cars and fragments from the surrounding buildings. 

“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! What the hell!”, I screamed in shock, before peering through the smouldering, smoky, debris-filled alley. I tried pulling out my gun, only to realise it wasn’t in my pocket! It must have been strewn somewhere in the explosion.

As I caught a glimpse of Aurora’s blond hair, I staggered to her location, avoiding the sharp bits lining the road. The place was full of nails, probably from the bomb.

There, I found Sam, who seemed to be fully lucid and physically unharmed like me. Better yet, he had his gun and a clear shot at Aurora, who was simply leaning against one of the blown out buildings.

“Sam. I don’t have my gun. Shoot!”, I commanded. He, however, lay there trembling and staring off at the distance.

“Sam. Now’s our only chance!”, I urged. Then, I realised that although he was physically unharmed, mentally…

“Not for long!”, Aurora snickered, before unexpectedly dragging Sam away by his legs. 

“Sam!” I yelled in surprise as I began pursuing him.

“He’ll be the first!”, she cackled as she jumped into the boot of a white van, roughly shoving an unaware Sam in.

“First? First of what?” I yelled out in frustration as I ran behind the van. As the van sped up, I knew I couldn’t continue to run. Rounding the corner past a convenience store whose doors had been blown off, I ran to the car, only to realise that its tires had been slashed and windscreen smashed in. 

That, too, must have been Aurora’s handiwork.

At that point, I had no other option. The van, too, was going further and urther away from me. And that was when I saw the motorbike leaning against a building.

Now, I would never normally do something like that, but I was desperate. 

I grabbed the motorbike, which for some reason had the keys still in the ignition, and gunned the acceleration. The motorbike roared as I manoeuvered it through the narrow roads and alleys, eventually merging into the main road. I weaved in and out of the Istanbul traffic at high speeds, keeping my eye solely on the speeding white van. Getting Sam back was all that mattered at the moment.

I probably looked like a madwoman then, so it was for the best that I wasn’t pulled over by the traffic police. I didn’t even have a helmet on me!

I continued tirelessly chasing the van for hours, driving across the Bosphorus, turning in and out of crowded streets, all to foil Aurora’s plan. Suddenly, the van began driving erratically, before slowing a little.

And why was that?

As the side door opened, a man with a beard was pushed out. As he fell hard on the tarmac, Aurora pulled out a pistol and shot him thrice in the head and heart, and once in the balls, before closing the door and driving on.

Oh, so that was why.

Eventually, I followed her through expansive green spaces and outside the city until the motorbike began sputtering for several seconds, before finally giving out. The van, meanwhile, continued on until disappearing from my sight.

“God fucking damn it!”, I swore, before dragging it to the nearest gas station. 

Twenty minutes later, at the gas station, I called Diana to know what happened to them after I bailed on them. However, after multiple attempts I still could not reach her phone. Next, I called Raj, who picked up after the second attempt.

“Hey Raj. Where are you guys at now?”, I enquired.

“We’re at the hospital right now.”

“The hospital? Why?”

“Oh, Diana got injured very badly, she took the brunt of the explosion. From what I saw, she got smashed headfirst into a brick wall. Oh, and she got injured badly by some of the flying nails. You should come here now!”

“Alright, I’ll come!”

Instead of refilling the motorbike, I opted to surreptitiously leave it somewhere before trying to hail a taxi rather than rough it out myself. Two hours of wrestling through traffic later, I arrived at the location Raj told me to come to.

I walked through the hospital doors and asked for Diana’s details, before heading straight for her ward. As soon as I saw her, I walked straight up to her bed.

“Are you okay?”

“Yeah, I’m pretty banged up, but I’ll probably get better soon. You’re fine, right?”

It was then, that I realised I was covered in cuts and scars. Well, after all, adrenaline is a hell of a drug.

“I’m not injured too badly, I’m fine.”

Then, Raj walked in.

“I’m back.”. Lowering his voice to a whisper, he asked, “So what about Aurora and Sam?”

I shook my head. “Nope. I couldn’t get a hold on them. I’m so sorry.”. I then explained the chase I underwent and Aurora’s eventual escape from me.

“It’s okay,”, Raj reassured, “We’ll find them soon.”

As I moved to the tracker and checked it, I came to a horrifying revelation.

“Raj”, I whispered, “It doesn’t work.”.

“What isn’t working?”

“The tracker. It says there’s an error and that it can’t locate her.”

“It must have been destroyed in the explosion, then”, Diana croaked. “The tracker was implanted in her.”

And that was when the gravity of our situation fully sank in. Without the tracker, we would not  be able to know where she was going, or even guess what she was doing. Barring any outside help, we were essentially running blind, our chase screeching to a halt.

I then suggested that we call the police, against our previous directive. “They might be able to help us locate her!”, I explained.

“That’s what I thought at first. Telling the police would be the right thing to do.”, Raj explained. However, we have our instructions. And besides, it is quite likely they might blame us for everything. Our marks are all over the place!”

Instead, we melancholically stayed in Istanbul for the next few days. Together, we tried a variety of ways to track them, like tracing Sam’s phone. Of course, none of it worked.

On day 3, when we were in the hotel room, Diana’s phone rang.

“Diana’s away for a few minutes. You answer them.”, Raj instructed me.

As he suggested, I picked up the phone and answered it. “Hello?”

“Hi, this is the agent from the corporation.”

Oh, so that was the agent Diana talked to.

“Alright, what is it?”

“From our intel, we’ve found where Aurora is going.”

“Where?”, I asked. Finally, we had somewhere to find her at!

“Leh.”

“Leh?”

“Leh, in Jammu and Kashmir. She entered in through Pakistan, if our information is correct.”

“Alright.”, I said. In reality, I would probably have to search that up on, like, Google Maps or something.

“We will be providing you with resources such as advanced weaponry like machine guns, UAVs and grenades, but you can only redeem these at Leh itself due to air travel constraints. Oh, and we’ve arranged for the entry permits to enter the state. Alright?”

“Alright then,”, I replied, “We’ll go there as soon as possible, then. Oh, and is Sam with her?”

“Yes”, the person confirmed, “Sam appears to be alive and with her.”

Ending the call, I turned to my colleagues. “We have orders guys!”, I called out. “Sam is alive! We’re going to Leh!”
