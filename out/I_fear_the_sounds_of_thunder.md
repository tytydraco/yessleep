Tw Blood

I live an a very rainy coutry. However, in my town it hasn't rained for over 2 weeks now. Our town is in a phase of silence,like the silence before a storm. It's always gray outside and thunder. Every thunder , the sky becomes more and more gray.

The country hasn't noticed our cries for help.

It has been sayed repeatedly that when a raindrop hits the ground and splashes into a pool of water , that doomsday will arrive.For that,many people and have bought some canned food for them. The constant state of paranoia of having everything washed away with us being the cherry on top is scary .

After 2 weeks of living depressingly in a house waiting for doomsday to strike, I got an alert that a code red storm is gonna take place for the 12 hours. 

I smiled reading the alert. It was a 'finally we are free' smile. I wanted to see what was outside. I peaked at the curtains and what I saw.. it was raining very bad yes,but in the middle of the street a bipedal creature clawing peoples doors trying to get in?

"What.?" I was still trying to get a good glance at him, maybe he was a lost merchant or something

That thought faded away as I saw him jump on the door of the oposite house,breaking the hinges and entering. People screamed and then a thunder hits 

I don't know what to do? Do I fight , do I run, do I hide . I look at the door and I got an idea. I go to my garage and get a few planks, a hammer and a box of nails and I start barricadating hoping the storm covers the loud hammering. But just as soon as I am ready to close the curtains I see him. 

Covered in the red paint of his victims,wearing it proudly like warpaint, looking at my house with the eyes that could show his intentions 

Then he starts running at full speed and knocks into my door with force,but the wooden plank worked for now. A loud thunder hit my eardrums now my ears ringing and my heart having more bpm than a agitated rat who is hunted down by a cat. Now I was the prey.

I went to my backyard,but he read my mind. I jumped the fence to enter the vet clinic since no one was working. Locked, I could feel death's cold breath on my neck. I break the window and run to somewhere. Thunder hit again. I runned and hid somewhere. I took a tranquilizer syringe and that was that.

I stood that night in a corner just hearing hopelessly as the thunder striked and faint screams.

Next morning, there was finally sun. I looked at the news and apparently it was a serial killer. 

I don't think it was a serial killer for the fact that thunder can still be heard on a sunny day.
