This is a long story. But if I’m going to tell the truth about Room 409, you need the whole picture. I’ve seen what happens when you only remember pieces.

I don’t usually post stuff like this.
I’ve worked in law enforcement for over a decade. I’ve seen overdoses, suicides, disappearances — the worst humanity has to offer. You learn to compartmentalize, or the job will hollow you out.

But there’s one case I could never shake…one that changed everything for me…

————-

Two bodies. No trauma. No drugs. Just two people, lifeless in a hotel room — still dressed, still posed, still watching something that wasn’t there anymore.

The official report says we don’t know how they died.

That’s not true.

I’ve been to the room. I’ve seen what’s waiting there.

And I think it’s time someone else did too.

———

The photographs lay scattered across the metal tabletop like remnants of some ritual no one dared name.

The images captured two bodies, a man, and a woman. Both were twisted, but not violently — more like they had been wrung out and drained emotionally rather than physically. Their skin bore the pale-gray hue of forgotten marble, smooth, bloodless, and waxen. The man and woman’s eyes were wide open, fixated on nothing, and coated in a thin film like gossamer. Their mouths were slightly parted not in fear, but confession.

No signs of struggle. No needle marks. No ligatures. No bruising. Tox screen came back clean. They were just… gone, as if their souls had quietly slipped out through the pores and never looked back.

“It’s like they ceased to exist,” Brenner said beside me, settling into the seat with a look that didn’t match his usual confidence. “No trauma, no resistance, and no definitive cause. Coroner says it’s like something pulled the soul right out of them.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t stop staring at the woman’s face. It was a look that was truly the stuff of nightmares. There was no peaceful expression, nor was there one of distress. Instead, she appeared hollow, a shell of the woman she was before. Whatever she saw in her final, uncertain moments weren’t meant for human eyes.

I swallowed, my eyes struggling to pull away from the blood chilling scene in the photographs. 

“Time of death?” I finally managed.

“Forty-eight hours before discovery. Best guess,” Brenner shook his head. “Even that’s shaky though. They were dressed and there were no signs of a struggle at all. Room service was completely untouched. The strangest part? Every mirror in the room was covered.”

That caught my attention. I looked up in puzzlement. “Covered?”

Brenner acknowledged the look with a nod and resumed. “Towels. Bedsheets, hell, the woman even used her coat. They covered every reflective surface in the room. It’s like they were trying not to look at something.”

Or they didn’t want something to see them. I thought in silence to myself.

“There’s more,” he added grimly, his voice dropping like a stone. “They had no IDs and there were no records of any check-ins from anybody from around the time they would have been in that room. The hotel’s system has nothing either. They were only found because the maid smelled mildew and ozone. She said the room gave her a headache just walking past it.”

I flipped to another photo. The door. Room 409. The brass number plate was crooked and corroded, like the door itself had been terminally ill for a long time. I brushed the photo aside to see a photo of a note, written in frantic, borderline illegible writing.

Two simple words written massively into the paper like a final cry for help, “Never again”. 

“They weren’t the first, were they?” I whispered.

Brenner didn’t look up.

“No,” he said. “Just the first we couldn’t explain away.”

⸻

That conversation haunted me. Every detail carved itself into my memory.

For months, I replayed it. Obsessively. That room. Those photos. That look in her eyes.

Something about it got under my skin — like a needle sparking the catalyst for addiction.

Eventually, I gave in.

I had to know what happened. Not just to them…but to the others. The ones written off, forgotten. Lost to time.

That’s when I went to the Lotus Hotel.

The place wasn’t even on the map anymore. The parking lot was cracked and crumbling. The building loomed behind overgrown hedges and trees half-swallowed by its own neglect — as if the world had tried to erase it. The neon sign above the front doors sputtered in the rain, casting jaundiced light across the rain-slick parking lot. A few letters flickered in and out — fighting to stay lit or trying to disappear.

But I knew where I was.

Fourth floor. Room 409.

Where all the stories began, and where they always seemed to end.

⸻

Inside, the lobby reeked of mildew and rotted wood. Wallpaper curled from the walls in long, curling strips like peeling skin. Mold painted the corners of the baseboards. A chandelier overhead trembled in place like it was afraid of falling and flickered like it had forgotten how to stay lit.

The elevator that rested on the other side of the room groaned in its shaft like it was waking up reluctantly.

At the front desk sat a clerk. Skin the color of wet ash, eyes that didn’t blink. Preserved but not alive.

I approached the clerk with as friendly of a demeanor as I could muster. “I need the key to—”

Before I could even finish, he slid it across the counter — rusted and worn, the tag dangling like a noose.

The tag read in spidery handwriting, “Room 409”.

I stared at him, perplexed at how he could have possibly known what I was there for. “How did you—?”

“You’re not the first,” the clerk voiced flatly, without weight or warmth.

I winced nervously but didn’t ask what he meant.

I took the key and walked to the elevator. Once inside, I pressed the button and watched the panel light up beneath my finger. The cage rattled to life as it began its slow ascension towards my destination.

I leaned against the wall as it rose, thinking maybe I was being reckless. That maybe going alone was a mistake. But I knew one thing for sure:

Whatever answers existed — if they existed at all — they were upstairs.
⸻

The fourth floor was wrong.

The hallway stretched for too long. Not physically, but architecturally. It was reminiscent to that of a carnival funhouse, the warped dimensions seemed to make the hallway spin and shake making balance difficult. The proportions felt… wrong, like a ribcage extended by unnatural means.

The wallpaper was the color of aged bruises and curled from the seams like dead leaves. The carpet sagged in places, stained in dark, blooming shapes that suggested something had once crawled…and bled.

The overhead lights blinked rapidly without any distinct rhythm as I turned my attention towards the end of the hallway.

Room 409 waited at the far end like a patient. Its number plate hung crooked, edges clawed and bent, as if someone had tried to scratch it off but was unsuccessful in doing so. 

The metal had refused to be erased but just beneath the handle there was a small handprint.

It wasn’t smeared or pressed. It was a child’s handprint that was perfectly preserved.

My grip tightened around the key, chills creeping up my spine in a slow march. I’ve seen a lot of things. War zones, crime scenes, human grief in its rawest forms. That was all a part of the job description, but this felt different.

This felt aware, calculated…deliberate. It was like the room knew who it was waiting for and had set a trap to lure me into its clutches.

The key slid in like it remembered me and the door opened without resistance to reveal that the room was…

Normal?

Was this a ruse? An illusion hiding something worse? Possibly?

I blinked. I don’t know what I expected — gore, maybe, or something supernatural right out the gate. But what I saw was a generic hotel room. Beige walls. A neatly made bed. A chair by the window. A desk with a mirror.

It was bland, beige, and forgettable. Nothing you would give a second glance to.

Neatly made bed. Chair by the window. A desk. A mirror.

But something felt off. The temperature was colder than the hallway. It wasn’t freezing but it was the kind of cold that lingers after someone breathes on your neck.

There was a subtle, continuous hum that floated in the air as well. It was soft, but not mechanical. Was it the plumbing? No, that couldn’t be it. Breathing?

I shook it off and stepped inside, that’s when the door clicked shut behind me. I jumped, then cursed under my breath. I wasn’t usually this rattled, but something about this place clawed at me.

It feels like I’m not supposed to be here.

The light casted from the lamp dimmed by a hair, just enough to make the shadows feel participatory…watching.

I scanned my surroundings again, the room feeling different than it was before now that the lighting had changed.

That’s when I saw the suitcase beside the chair and on the desk: a leather-bound journal.

I picked it up and felt its cracked spine and curled edges in my hands. The texture felt like skin that had seen too much sun.

This wasn’t in any of the crime scene photos. I thought as I opened it. So, what was it doing here?

I flipped through the pages and to my surprise, most of them were blank.

But near the back, one sentence had been scrawled in spidery handwriting into the page’s center:

“You’re not the first.”

My stomach dropped. The words from the clerk downstairs, they were written here. Was this all a prank by the hotel?

But before I could dwell on it further, a laugh rang out from the bathroom.

It was high, sharp, but childlike in nature.

I turned my attention from the journal and noticed that the door to the bathroom was slightly ajar.

There was no light, no movement, just the creeping veil of darkness peeking out from the crack in the door.

“Old pipes,” I muttered, trying to believe it. My own words tasted of denial as I placed the journal back onto the desk. None of this was making sense but I came here to get answers, and I wasn’t going to leave without them.

I sat at the bed’s edge, the springs sighed beneath me not from my weight, but from the memory of someone else seemingly.

My eyes surveilled the wall, studying for what could be an unknown terror beyond its unappealing features. I couldn’t tell if it was the lighting or if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but the wallpaper seemed to pulse slowly like breath behind plaster.

I stood and crossed the room towards the window, unease mounting.

I expected to see a view of the outside world but instead, I was met with a brick wall.

That wasn’t possible. The Lotus Hotel was supposed to overlook the street from this location. How could a brick wall be here to obstruct my view?

I turned my back to the window to head back towards the door to leave the room but noticed that the door looked farther away than it had previously. It was as if the room had elongated to a disproportionate, impossible size to keep me from escape. 

The shadows in corners of the room had deepened due to the light shrinking in size and magnitude.

My view rested itself at the mirror above the desk.

It reflected the bed, the lamp, the suitcase, and me sitting back on the bed.

Only… I wasn’t. I was standing, but the version of me in the mirror wasn’t looking back anymore.

I didn’t move and neither did the version of me in the mirror.

My eyes transfixed on this other version of me as it sat perfectly still on the edge of the bed —hands on knees, spine straight, expression vacant. He was just like me in an uncanny sort of way, for his posture was too precise. Too stiff, not relaxed, unnatural.

It was as if this other me were like a mannequin posed to imitate memory.

I took a slow, deliberate step forward, but the reflection didn’t follow.

It stayed still, rooted in place on its spot on the bed as its doll-like eyes trailed me. A dark, faint smile pulled at its lips in a vain attempt to perform being human.

I turned away, my skin perspiring as my stomach knotted in ways I didn’t know were possible. My skin prickled like I’d just remembered something out of order — like realizing I left the stove on… after hearing the fire alarm from down the street.

I made for the door, boots thudding against the aged carpet in an eager attempt to escape.

One step. Two. Three.

By the fourth, the door didn’t seem any closer and by the fifth, it looked further away.

“How is this possible?…” The words fell out of my mouth like breath on glass. Useless. Fragile.

I turned around and noticed that everything regarding my surroundings had completely changed.

The mirror was gone. So was the desk and the suitcase. Even the lamp’s soft, sickly warm glow, gone without a single trace.

The bed was the only thing that remained. Its sheets were untouched, corners perfect. It was like it had never been used at all…

The hum in the air started to grow, like cicadas on a summer day.

It wasn’t mechanized nor was it the buzz of electricity or old plumbing, this was organic.

It felt like the sound of breath held too long after surfacing from deep water.

Or like something waiting, lurking. Not to be seen…but recognized.

I ran a hand across my face and felt it come away damp from the sweat dampening my skin.

My body felt like it was in a sauna, but the room was ice-cold, like a meat locker.

My throat was parched. That kind of bone-dry, grief-laced kind of thirst you get after swallowing something you were supposed to say but didn’t.

I looked down at my hands and noticed they were trembling slightly.

It was enough to feel like a warning, an omen of something unfathomable approaching.

The TV suddenly clicked on behind me.

No remote. No sound.

Just the static hissing in the air in an almost deafening way.

A snowstorm of distortion, glitching pixels, and behind it — something else bleeding through. My living room.

Same worn and beat up couch, a bottle of Jack half-empty on the floor.

A man’s voice — hoarse, shouting.

Not just any man though, it was me. Red-faced. Hunched. Screaming at someone just out of frame.

Something about trust and about lies.

About — “You said she was at your sister’s!”

The footage jumped to show me all alone, crying violently. Clutching a photograph in my hands like it had betrayed me in the worst way imaginable.

Another jump in the footage and this time, I was kneeling at a gravestone of a child.

I was wearing that same trench coat and had the same weathered hands.

A small toy elephant sat behind the stone. Sun-bleached, yet familiar.

A hand touched my shoulder…it was my own.

I recoiled in terror before the screen abruptly went to black.

I could hear nothing but my frantic panting as I tried to grasp what all was happening in this moment. 

I stared at the completely black TV screen as it lay dormant. 

What was that quote from Friedrich Nietzsche? I thought, trying to regain my composure.

“He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.”?

Was the TV the abyss gazing into me? I pondered as I pulled my eyes away, praying that this was the end of whatever hellscape I found myself entangled in.

My prayers went unanswered as the TV flickered to life again:

Room 409.

The numbers looked diseased, peeling…melting.

The footage playing before me now showed another version of me. This one was lying dead on the bed, eyes wide. The mouth was torn open, as if something had scrambled its way out from the inside. Just like the crime scene photos…

I watched as the words “Never Again” began being clawed across the walls in erratic, looping handwriting. 

The wallpaper bled the blackest ink like a gushing wound.

This wasn’t metaphor, this was reality.

I staggered back, my heel catching on something and nearly tripping over.

I turned to see that the mirror, the desk, and the journal had all returned to their previous respective places…

I stumbled towards the desk and retrieved the journal.

The room pulsed around me, not visibly, but vibrantly. Like space had grown tired of pretending to be stable.

My breath had gone shallow and my heart beat like it was tapping Morse code for run.

The journal’s worn, withered leather appeared warped from time or heat…perhaps even memory.

The pages were yellowed, frayed, and soft at the edges. I flipped to the first page to reveal my own handwriting.

It read, “You died here once already. Do better this time.”

I stared anxiously, waiting for the ink to vanish.

It didn’t, however.

I reached out with a slightly trembling finger and pressed it against the page, it was still warm, still fresh.

Then…the journal palpitated just once, like a heartbeat.

I snapped it shut fearfully as I watched the room begin morphing once more with my own eyes.

The walls began to throb, not visually…not yet. Something behind these dreaded, bland walls had lungs.

The air thickened, like breathing through wet cotton.

Then came three knocks.

Soft, not loud nor impatient. These sounded expectant.

I turned toward the door, my heart pounding in my throat like an incessant drumbeat.

These knocks didn’t demand attention, they seemed to be calling to me.

I reached for the handle, uncertain as to what could await me…but then I stopped.

I felt something in my pocket. My hand descended to pull the object that seemingly manifested itself there to reveal that it was a key.

Not the hotel key, this one was different. This one was older, more rusted. It felt heavy with meaning.

Etched into its side like sacred scripture were three numbers:

409

Behind me, the bed creaked as if to scream in agony.

I turned but there was no one there. The mirror revealed my reflection was back and seated again.

This time… it was crying.

Thick streams of crimson blood flowed down like a grotesque waterfall as it looked upon me, lips contorting into a broken, crooked smile. One that seemed to say, I’m sorry for what comes next.

My knees buckled and gave out beneath me, the key clattering to the floor by my side.

I floundered and fumbled like a fish out of water, reaching for anything that felt real. 

That’s when I noticed the journal nearby and grabbed it, feeling it in my clutches once more.

It radiated an unsettling warmth, and it felt heavier, like it had teeth
⸻
Before I could focus on it longer, the door opened with a sluggish, intentional groan.

A thin wedge of light spilled into the room, pale and colorless.

I forced myself upright against the bed and stumbled toward the doorway in a fearful silence.

I gripped the door tightly and opened it wider to find myself staring down another hallway. This wasn’t the one from the Lotus Hotel, this one felt…older, more personal.

The wallpaper was in a state of gradual but immense decay. The faded roses hemorrhaged through the plaster.

The air smelled like a bygone fragrance and wood left to rot.

At the end of the hallway, the light illuminated a figure. They were seated knees to chest, head bowed in what appeared to be prayer.

“Hello?” I managed. My voice barely made it past my lips before the figure stirred.

I was met with a pale face, with sunken features. Grime and time clinging to her skin. She was like a corpse resurrected from the depths of the earth.

“Don’t be afraid,” she voiced in a hushed whisper. “They don’t like it when you’re afraid.”

I stepped closer cautiously, “Who… who are you?”

She glanced upward, listening to something I couldn’t hear.

“Name’s Marla,” she answered. “Been here longer than I can remember. You’re not the first to survive Room 409, but…”

She trailed off with hesitation, the pregnant pause lingering in the air until she finished, “You might be the first to leave and bring it with you.”

 “Bring what?” I blinked, our eyes meeting one another’s.

“This place,” she spoke, as she gestured towards our surroundings. “It doesn’t just trap you; it copies you and follows you out. Lives in the spaces between your thoughts.”

She curled and brought her knees to her chest tighter.

“They all say, “Never Again”. But the room remembers, it’s patient. It always bides its time…”

The lights scintillated in a menacing tone, causing Marla to flinch.

“Time’s running out. You need to remember what you forgot before the door closes again.”

 “What did I forget?” My voice cracked like porcelain as I contemplated what I could have forgotten.

Her mouth formed a sad, knowing smile.

“That you never really left.”

______________

I blinked as her words revealed the crippling revelation of what I found myself in.

She didn’t however, Marla was too still, too symmetrical. And just for a fleeting second, her shadow didn’t match her body.

I took a step back, wary of potential danger.

“Are you… real?”

She tilted her head slightly, her eyes shifting. Not with emotion, but out of mechanism.

“I’m what’s left when remembering hurts too much,” she murmured, as she continued to pull her knees tightly against herself. “You made me.”

The hallway warped, the roses bled across the wallpaper like watercolors drowning in themselves.

Marla stared past me, “The room shows you what you need to see. What you fear. What you buried.”

Then her eyes locked on to me. “But it also buries you.”

“What memories?” My fingers scratched the back of my neck, aching for answers.

She rose slowly, like a moon on a lonely night. Her joints cracked like frozen branches in winter.

Her eyes were like the cold steel of iron.

“The ones you told yourself never happened.”

The hallway groaned as the shadows gathered in the corners like cockroaches

They whispered things that were almost decipherable to my own ear…the desire to understand those things was suffocating.

I reached toward one, this one resembled the discernable shape of a person.

It reached back, almost in longing before Marla grabbed my wrist with force. “Don’t, they’re not real. But they want you to believe they are.”

My knees buckled slightly, the smell of sulfur and rot closed in around me like a wet cloth.

“I’m… losing myself,” I whispered, nauseous from the pungent smell that filled my nostrils asphyxiatingly.

Marla nodded. “That’s what it does. Piece by piece. Until you forget there ever was an actual you.”

Then, like a mirror shattering inward…a memory manifested itself in my conscious.

A hospital room, a child’s hand in mine, a toy elephant on a chair.

The child’s wide, uncertain eyes looked into mine as a voice echoed in the deepest recesses of my mind:

“I never left you.”

The image cracked apart and dissipated as quickly as it had appeared.

I found myself back in the hallway with Marla.

Her voice was sharp now. “Remember what you buried, before the door closes for good.”

I clutched the rusted key; its weight held me steady like an anchor.

The hallway began to stretch and warp, like a dream breaking apart. The far door drifted away like a ship slipping beneath a dark tide.

I stood tall and cleared the bile from my throat with a cough, “I’m not leaving without the truth.”

Marla’s gaze softened — proud, mournful. “Good, because this place makes sure you never forget.”

She stepped backward, fading into the dark as the shadows hugged her with welcome.

“And sometimes…” She was almost gone. “…it demands a price.”

The lights shattered, and glass fell from the ceiling like scalding hail. Whispers screamed my name…laughing, crying, wailing as I shielded myself with my arms above my head. 

I shook the glass off me and stepped forward into the permeating darkness. 

I gripped the key in my hand like a lifeline…

I will tell more when the time is right but for now let me leave you with these parting words…don’t trust your reflection.
