 We didn't sleep. That experience had been traumatic. Those noises, that voice, that atmosphere even once I'd returned, the silence couldn't dissolve their memories. They brought back deeply buried fears, a feeling of pure insecurity. Mia and I remained motionless, separated by a void, absorbed in our thoughts. I tried my best to rationalize, to find reasons, explanations, to the point of doubting I'd heard him. Him, that child, boy or girl, I don't know. I tried to deny from the depths of my being that moment, those words, his distress, his very existence. I failed.

Anguish gripped my throat, I couldn't breathe, every breath painful and in vain. That's when my mind failed me and reality cracked. I saw blood everywhere around me. Then a stab struck me right in the heart. I felt the blade pierce me. The coldness of the metal in my burning flesh. The pain as it sliced ​​my skin, scraped my ribs. Then the tip sank gently into my heart. I felt my blood drip from the wound, my body sinking, my mind shutting down. I felt death, and the dagger withdraw from my heart, cutting more and more flesh.

An intense pain accompanied by jolts and screams jolted me out of my stupor. Mia had slapped me, hard, so hard that she pulled me from my own death. My cheek burned, it was swollen, I could feel my blood pulsing through it.

I was alive.

*-"What happened?"*

*-"I don't know! You froze, your hands on your chest. You were gripping your fingers so tightly on your t-shirt that their tips turned white! You stared straight ahead with your eyes frozen, empty, your body stiff. I called you, I slapped you, several times, harder and harder, you didn't come back!"*

She spoke quickly. Her voice trembled, oscillating between screams and sobs. Her words broke, and then she broke down in tears. I felt helpless; coming back to reality after what I had felt was trying, but I had to pull myself together for my friend.

*-"I must have had an anxiety attack, I guess. Shit, that was the scariest thing I've ever experienced. I'm sorry.*

*-"An anxiety attack? I don't believe it! It looked worse than that!"*

I couldn't tell her about my experience; it was too much for her, and too much for me. Her terror would only have increased. I preferred to change the subject and try to move the discussion forward.

*"Okay, okay... Um... Listen, everything's fine now, thanks for helping me. Try to calm down. We need to think about what's next? Okay?"*

*"Okay."*

She didn't look ready for this, I know. I was being harsh and cruel by not taking her emotional state into consideration, but I had no choice. We couldn't just stand there, petrified. We'd already wasted several hours in the nothingness of our minds. We had to move.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We decided to talk to the head waiter at the front desk about what happened during the night. If anyone knows what happened, it's definitely him. We were exhausted, but fear kept us awake and alert, so we might as well try to be productive.

We were heading towards the elevator when I spotted her, covered in a white cape, her face hidden by a large hood, crossing the corridor, her heels clicking. I put my hand on Mia's arm to get her attention. She almost screamed when she saw her, so I quickly clapped my hand over her mouth. The woman stopped dead in her tracks; I prayed she wouldn't notice us. She stood there, staring straight ahead at the metallic blue elevator doors. We stood frozen, stopping moving, stopping breathing. I could see some of her facial features in the reflection of the doors; she looked young, but it was hard to be sure; her reflection wasn't clear.

When the elevator dinged to announce her arrival with a high-pitched "ding," I felt relieved; this unpleasant moment was finally over. I then saw her distorted reflection turn her gaze slightly toward us. She paused, smiled, and then stepped into the elevator. When we heard the doors close, we were finally able to breathe. Both of us, doubled over, catching our breaths as if we'd run a marathon. Mia spoke first.

*-"She's just a woman, right?"*

*-"Obviously..."*

I heard in my voice that I wasn't so sure of myself anymore.

*-"So why did we react like that?"*

*-"I don't know anything about it."*

We took a few minutes to collect our thoughts before continuing on our way.

When I got to the elevator, it showed she'd gone down to -2." -2? But the rules forbid the basement, right?" "Indeed... That shouldn't apply to her."

I don't understand what's happening, I feel strange, I have the impression that my body wants to escape, to leave, to run, far away, even if it has to do it without me and leave me here. I was lost. I can't stand being in the dark and there I was totally in the dark.

Mia took my hand to reassure me. She had sensed that I was beginning to waver. I'm ashamed of myself, but the feeling of her hand in mine was the most reassuring thing I've ever experienced.

We went down to the lobby. The maître d' was there, at his post, classy and serious. Mia greeted him.

\-" Hello Sir "

\-"Good morning, Miss, Sir, was your night pleasant?"

*-"Well, to tell you the truth, no. We didn't really sleep. We came here to talk about this. Was there an accident last night or something that would explain the deafening sound of pounding metal that echoed throughout the hotel around 2 a.m.?"*

*-"Miss, I'm sorry you couldn't sleep last night. But I must say I don't know what you're talking about. Did you hear the sounds of beating metal?"*

His surprised expression with raised eyebrows didn't convince me. It seemed fake. He hadn't cheated on Mia either, who got angry.

*-"Yes, extremely loud, really deafening. We can't be the only ones who heard it!"*

*-"Please calm down. I'm sorry, miss, no other customer has complained about such noise, and there has been no event that would explain this."*

*"But..."*

The butler cut him off.

*-"Miss, perhaps you have experienced one of these paranormal phenomena? Isn't that why you are here?"*

His tone had become condescending, almost mocking.

She had been fooled by her own beliefs, thrown right back in her face. I sensed her frustration as her hand gripped mine tightly. So I took over.

*-"You'll excuse me, but it didn't seem like a paranormal phenomenon, it was horrible. There was this voice..."*

The butler also interrupted me; it was definitely a habit for him. In an authoritarian voice, he rebuffed me.

*-"A voice? Isn't it part of the rules to ignore them?"*

*-"But there..."*

*-"Just follow the rules. I'm sorry your night was so disturbed by these famous... phenomena. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do about it. You knew what to expect; you signed up. If you don't have any further questions, I'll get back to my business. Have a good day."*

I held her back one last time.

*- "Yes, I have another question. What are these "special customers"?*

*-"If you don't know, then you shouldn't know."*

The butler disappeared off to who knows where, leaving us there with even more questions. We weren't hungry, so we skipped breakfast and decided to take a tour of the property.

We sat on benches along the tennis court. We lit a cigarette, took a deep drag, and exhaled our frustration into the smoke. 

*-"Alec... There's no denying that there are indeed some strange things here. But I don't know... how strange... or how dangerous."*

*-"That's true, I don't know. Before, I would have told you that it was a setup to make us believe in all this, in ghosts and paranormal phenomena. That the hotel is playing with mystery. They wouldn't be the first to create devices to create the illusion. But I have to admit, Mia, that even if that's the case, I'm really... uncomfortable, not to say scared... either they're really good, or I'm losing my mind."*

*-"I understand, I'm scared too, now that I have a clear head, I'm perplexed about what's going on here... We should check some phenomena tonight."*

A shiver ran down my spine and my body trembled at the thought of spending a second night here.

*-"I really don't want to go through that again..."*

*-"I know, me neither, you know, but we're here and beyond our bet, I have a feeling we really have to find out what's going on here."*

*-"Okay, what do you suggest?"*

*-"I brought some equipment. I didn't want to take it out until I was sure it was worth it. Now I have good reasons to do so."*

So that was what the many suitcases were for. She had planned everything to verify the veracity of the phenomena. Even if she believes in the paranormal, she wouldn't accept being scammed.

*-"I should have known. What kind of equipment did you bring with you?"*

She looked around, checking that no one was listening. She was being cautious. We didn't know what was really going on here, and the maître d's answers made us feel that any questioning was impossible; he just had to refer us to the rules. Everything was done to prevent us from searching... or rather, from finding.

*-"I have several devices like sound recorders, temperature and magnetic field sensors, cameras obviously with infrared vision. Everything a ghost hunter could bring, the basics."*

*-"The base? Obviously... It's great Mia, normally I would have certainly laughed, but now I have to say I'm glad you brought all this."*

I started to laugh, a nervous little laugh. I had released some of the pressure. I offered.

*-"We should walk around the hotel to see if we notice anything."*

\- *"What are we looking for?"*

*-"Honestly? No idea... but we have nothing better to do, and we'll know what we're looking for when we find it. I think that's the reply of any good adventurer of the unknown."*

Mia started laughing and approved of my idea, so we started walking around the hotel.

The surroundings were surrounded by fences and very high hedges, which separated us from the forest. It was like a huge green wall that prevented us from entering an even larger labyrinth. There was no one overlooking us.

The tennis court and swimming pool were perfectly clean, new, and empty, but that wasn't particularly surprising given the time of year. No scratches, no wear, always that perfection. They looked as if they had never been used, as if there was no life in them.  
I felt as if I were visiting a life-size model, crafted with disturbing realism.  
I also noticed the silence: the only sound I could hear was our footsteps in the gravel. Not a bird, not even a breath of wind in the leaves.  
Silence. Emptiness. I shared my impressions.

*-"We are totally isolated, and this place really gives the impression of being..."*

*-"An anomaly? The feeling of not being in our place... As if it's no one's place..."*

We walked along the fence that marked the boundary of the property until we reached the back of the hotel. There, the mountain loomed, massive, barely separated from the building. As we approached, we realized: the rear facade was invisible. It was fused into the rock. The hotel seemed to spring from the mountain, as if it were part of it. No passage, no possible access. Yet, judging by the hotel's interior structure, and the corridors that formed a perfect square on our floor, something was amiss. Mia, too, seemed to understand the problem.

*-"One side of the hotel doesn't have any windows? On all floors? We didn't go look in the back corridor, are there any rooms on that side? We'll have to check."*

*-"Yes, you're right. The woman in white was coming from that direction earlier if I remember correctly. There are rooms without windows? This is crazy! Everything is perfectly symmetrical in this damn hotel! And there would be such an aberration! Impossible!"*

I refused to believe this nonsense, but I had no explanation. I felt fucking stupid at that moment, my ego suffered, and it didn't like that at all. We continued to wander around the hotel. We still hadn't seen another guest since the evening of our arrival, yet the parking lot was still full. Alone outside, we took the opportunity to look inside the cars. It was disturbing; it too was clean, empty, with no apparent life. Again.

Back in our room, Mia unpacked all her "ghost hunting" gear; she was pretty well equipped. She then pitched me an idea.

*-"It's almost noon, we're going to eat at the hotel restaurant for the first time. Since we can't go there in the evening, I'm thinking of hiding a voice recorder there. We'll get it back the next day; there might be some interesting conversations to listen to."*

*-"They seem to maintain the hotel really well. I wouldn't be surprised if they could clean the table and chair every day, even several times. He might find it."*

*-"That's true, but... I'll try anyway. My device is very discreet, with a bit of luck it will go unnoticed. We'll also meet the "special clients"! See if they exist."*

*-"Okay, I'll follow you."*

We had nothing to lose after all. I wasn't very hungry between the fatigue and the discomfort this place made me feel, but you don't fight on an empty stomach, do you?

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The restaurant mirrored the rest of the establishment, with round wooden tables perfectly aligned in three rows, impeccably set. The same symbol as in the entrance hall adorned the restaurant's floor, and large windows placed high up allowed natural light. It was a surprising choice, but ecologically sound. I imagine.

The very high ceiling had a large rectangular platform in the center. As I looked closer, I noticed that there was a mechanism to lower it. I preferred not to imagine what it might be used for.

When we entered, the room was full. All the customers, as one, froze. Their heads turned toward us, synchronized, like a giant pack of meerkats. A heavy silence fell, they stared at us expressionlessly, their gazes blank. So there are indeed special customers...

We walked between the tables, to sit in the only available place. The center.

Once seated, the restaurant came back to life and customers started eating again.

*-"Charming welcome."*

I whispered to Mia.

*-"Yes, and a little... scary."*

*-"I had the same feeling."*

Everyone in the restaurant had good manners, seemed wealthy and important. The men wore suits, the women beautiful dresses. We were almost embarrassing in our jeans and sweaters. There were no children, yet the clientele was young, in their thirties on average. I tried to strain my ears, to listen a little to the conversations of the other tables. In vain. I couldn't understand anything. They were all speaking in a language I didn't understand and didn't recognize. It sounded strange.

I tried to speak in a low voice as much as possible, because if we didn't understand their words, it didn't mean that they didn't understand us.

\- *"I've been thinking about some other strange things, we should check in outside after we eat. I don't feel like talking freely here."*

She nodded in agreement.

I felt watched, some customers glanced over at our table, looking at me or at Mia, and nodding or waving in our direction. We were surrounded, watched, and certainly the topic of conversation at every table.

   A waiter, in a very chic uniform, black trousers and shirt, vest and red bow tie. The menu included refined dishes whose names gave no clue as to what they were made of, but also, fortunately, more classic dishes. We ordered a hamburger and fries and ate in silence.

  Mia stood up.

*-"I need to go to the bathroom, I'll be right back, okay?"*

I was surprised, and the idea of ​​being alone didn't appeal to me, but I wasn't going to stop it.

*-"Of course."*

I watched him walk away toward the bar. The waiters were carefully polishing their cutlery and glasses. Mia pressed herself against the counter, on tiptoe. It must be said that she's not particularly tall. She called out to one of the waiters, probably to ask for directions to the restrooms, since he gestured to show her.

When she returned, we left the restaurant without dessert. Unlike our starter, no one seemed to notice our departure. I was holding the restaurant door for Mia like a good gentleman when I heard her.

***-*** *"Waiter please!"*

I turned around, surprised. I'd figured it out. The bastard had spoken our language. I caught his eye; his arm was raised to get noticed by the restaurant employee. The entire room fell silent and stared at me. Mia had left the restaurant, and I felt like prey spotted by a nest of predators. The man started speaking that strange language again, and the entire room did the same. Am I hallucinating? Is it just me, or do they all think we're fuking idiots?

Once back in the room, we debrief.

*-"Did you manage to install your device?"*

*- "Yes, I did it. I used some tape putty. The recorder is light so it won't fall over. I installed it under the bar counter. If I put it under our table and someone found it, they would immediately know it was us."*

*-"Great! I can't wait to hear what happens in the evening. Speaking of hearing, did you recognize the language they were all speaking?"*

*-"No, not at all, it was strange, it sounded like Latin but it wasn't. In any case, it sounded like a dead language, something ancient. If he speaks like that on the recorder, we could perhaps do voice recognition with an internet translator."*

*-"Yeah, it's still creepy, isn't it? That all the customers speak the same language."*

*-"That's true. Perhaps one of the conditions for being a special client?"*

*-"Sure. Did you hear him too? The man who spoke our language when we left?"*

*-"No, what did he say?"*

*-"Nothing interesting," he called the waiter. "But in our language, I'm sure they can all speak it."*

When we arrived at the hotel, one detail had struck me, but at the time I didn't think it was of any importance. Now that we had experienced all these events in barely 24 hours, I had changed my mind and decided to talk to Mia about it.

*-"Did you notice, when we were given the room key, that there were different colored keys?"*

\-"Really ?"

\- *"We got a blue key. I know it's weird, but on the key board, there were some blue ones and some red ones. You'd think each floor had its own color, but that's not the case, and they're also different in their shapes. There were plenty of blue keys available, but there were almost no red keys left."*

*-"You think "special customers" are in the rooms with the red key, if I understand correctly?"*

*-"Yes, that's what I think. These rooms must be different from ours."*

*-"Alec... At the restaurant there were only "special customers", I had started to consider it but I hoped that wasn't the case. That means we are the only two people here who aren't special."*

*-"I'm not sure. There are a few blue keys missing besides ours. But I'm like you, I haven't seen anyone else like us. So where are they?*
