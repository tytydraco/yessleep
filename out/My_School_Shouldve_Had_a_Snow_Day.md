If there’s anything every child looks forward to when they’re in school it’s a surprise day off. Such was the case one week in January for our district. At least, it should’ve been. My brother and I sat on the couch, watching the news. The names of different counties were scrolling by.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come on! Come on!” Calvin said, practically bouncing on the couch with his fingers crossed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Although I didn’t show it, I was just as eager. The anticipation was intense since our county’s name was last alphabetically.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Calvin, Omar, have you done the dishes yet?” our mom called from upstairs.

“We’re trying to watch the news,” Calvin replied.

“You were supposed to do it an hour ago. Get it done now.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Calvin looked at me. I rolled my eyes and got up. He smiled and said he’d let me know if we were off tomorrow. As I was scrubbing and then putting away the last dish, I heard Calvin from the living room.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Fuck,” he screamed to which our mom told him not to cuss.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He burst into the kitchen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Bad news, I take it?”

“Dude, literally every other school is off except us. There are flurries outside right now. How can they justify being open tomorrow?”

“It’s probably the principal.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was well-known around school that Principal Hogan had a drug problem. If he wasn’t on cocaine he was popping speed pills like candy.  Due to this, a lot of the funding ended up getting wasted and he needed to cut corners wherever he could. On top of that, the more days in the school year the more money he got.  He managed to keep this all under wraps by a combination of bribery and intimidation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Man, I swear when I see him I’m going to knock his fucking teeth out. Wait, maybe we can convince Mom and Dad to let us stay out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shook my head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know how they are.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Our parents' mentality was if we could get out of bed without wanting to puke, we could go to school. By that same token, if the school was open we had to go to it and that was final.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What if we skip then?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you want a repeat of sixth grade?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Calvin’s eyes filled with fear.  He was caught playing hooky once and the result of that was butt bruises and a month-long grounding.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Look, I know. It sucks. I hate this too. I was going to pull an all-nighter on Fallout.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Calvin’s rage eventually mellowed into resentful acceptance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Fine, I guess we should get ready for bed then. Good night.”

“Yeah.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The following morning we were dressed and heading out under the still-dark sky. The snow was coming down even harder and a layer of it covered the ground.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“This is such bullshit,” Calvin said.

“Do the buses even have snow tires?” I wondered aloud.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question was answered when ours came sliding down the road. It went over the sidewalk and knocked over a trash bin before the driver managed to straighten it out. I could see Calvin’s breath cloud as he exhaled in irritation.  The bus stopped, nearly hitting our mailbox, and the door opened. We made sure to grab the rail since the steps were wet and got inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At the very least, we could share in misery with the other students. The driver constantly jerked the wheel back and forth as we went over ice patches. By some miracle, we were able to make it to school without further collisions.  The windows were all dark and somehow we knew that wasn’t going to change.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Well, see you later,” Calvin told me when we got off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told him the same and we went our separate ways.  The bleakness only added to our dour moods. The backup generator’s lights were the only thing providing illumination.  The only foods available for breakfast were biscuits even drier than Popeye’s with styrofoam eggs and cheese that tasted like burnt plastic.  Still, we hadn’t gotten up early enough for breakfast at home so this was slightly better than going hungry.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First period was math class. At least it meant getting the worst subject out of the way.  Frost covered the windows and I hoped that the leak in the ceiling above my seat had stopped. It hadn’t. I moved my desk to the right and wiped away the discolored liquid with my sleeve. Mr. Hewitt arrived six minutes after the bell.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Somehow, he looked even worse than I felt and even from that distance I could smell the alcohol on his breath. His hair was uncombed and by the looks of it, he'd slept in his clothes. His shirt was partially untucked and buttoned incorrectly in several areas.  I’m pretty sure his zipper was open and he didn’t seem to notice that he was spilling coffee onto the floor.  He plopped down at his desk and straightened his tie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, given the circumstances, class is going to be a bit different today. I had a presentation planned, but obviously, that’s not an option right now so get out your textbooks.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went over some problems while he ate some snacks he confiscated from students for eating in class.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You know what?” he suddenly asked. “What’s the point? That’s what I keep hearing all the goddamn time. “Mr. Hewitt, what’s the point of learning this? I’m never going to need it outside of school!” Well, how about a word problem?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stood up and went to the board as we watched in awkward silence, then began writing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“If you married your wife in 2004 and came home yesterday to find out she’s been fucking your mechanic how much of your life did you just waste?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Someone raised their hand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Eight years?”

“Good guess, but you’re forgetting the variables, things like all the time and money you spent to ensure she had a nice place to live. Oh yeah, and let’s not forget the child support.  Do you want to know which parent is getting prime custody? I’ll give you a hint. You’re not looking at him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was times like that when I was glad the teachers didn’t have guns. Mr. Hewitt took out a flask and topped off his coffee before taking another sip. He went to wipe away his lopsided writing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ah, shit,” he murmured, seeing he didn’t have any.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His eyes scanned the room before falling on me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You,” he pointed and snapped his fingers a few times, “Oscar.”

“It’s Omar.”

“I need you to go up to the principal’s office and see if they have any extra erasers. I would use my shirt, but I don’t want to get anything on it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Glancing briefly at the coffee stains covering his shirt, I stood up to leave, thankful I had a reason to get out of there. On the way, I needed to take a leak and stopped by the bathroom. Luckily for me, the working urinal wasn’t occupied. Since the sinks were broken most of the time, I always had some hand sanitizer with me. The less time spent in Principal Hogan’s presence the better.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wanted to get in, get the erasers, and get out. I was going to knock on the door. To my surprise, though, it was ajar.  I pushed it open and found the room empty. I figured the staff was getting high in the back of the teacher’s lounge.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Either was fine with me. Vice Principal Fletcher was addicted to sniffing expo markers. She would inhale too much on occasion and draw all over her office. Due to this, she had a surplus of erasers. I went to her door and found it was also open. I got an eraser and was about to head back when a weird noise caught my ear. It was like two horses screaming while stomping in yogurt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I made a mistake in giving in to my curiosity. The noises were coming from Principal Hogan’s office. I peeked in through the window and to my horror he and Vice Principal Fletcher were going at it. Both were naked and told each other things I dare not repeat here. I recoiled from the door, gagging while holding a hand over my mouth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wanted to get as far away from there as possible and I would have if not for what I heard next.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh yeah, you like that?” Principal Hogan yelled.

“Give it to me!” Vice Principal Fletcher moaned back. “Wait, Ernie, what is that?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I detected concern in her voice, unlike Principal Hogan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Don’t worry about it. Just focus on-”

“No, the window!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I panicked and froze, thinking I was about to be caught. Then I realized she wasn’t referring to the one in the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What in the holy hell is that?” Principal Hogan asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was the first time I ever heard him frightened and that in turn caused me to grow concerned. I can hardly describe what occurred next since it happened so fast. There was the sound of glass shattering followed by screaming. Then the door window was splattered with blood. I nearly shat myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The door handle jiggled and I shot out of there. Something came out of the office and took notice of me as indicated by its shrieking. Whatever it was it was fast because the noises it made were growing louder. Despite this, I didn’t hear it moving. There were no footsteps or anything like that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I screamed my head off that something was in the school. Then I dashed through a door leading to the stairs. Instead of going up, I hid behind the open door to throw the creature off. Fortunately, this worked and it passed me by. I risked one glance and saw a mass of floating purple tentacles pushing through the other door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When it was gone, I could catch my breath. I was loud enough to wake the dead which meant at least some classes would have been alerted. The same thing couldn’t be said of the classes upstairs. Shortly later, more screams came from upstairs. My heart sank as I tried to figure out what to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then it stopped when I saw multiple shapes similar to the one that was after me passing by the window. I cursed my parents for being so goddamn strict. If they’d just let us stay home we wouldn’t be dealing with this. Speaking of Calvin, I needed to get to him before these things did. His class was located at the basement level.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I took the stairs and cautiously went through the door.  Calvin’s class was a ways away and if that weren’t enough, more of those things were already down there. One almost spotted me, but I managed to slip into a bathroom in time. A toilet flushed and Calvin stepped out of a stall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“God damn,” he said, fanning the air with his hand.

“Calvin.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He turned to me and was about to say something when I quickly shushed him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Listen-” I said when the smell pierced my nostrils. “oh god, what did you eat?”

“Sorry, I think the milk I had at breakfast was bad. What are you doing here?”

“Okay, this will sound crazy and I’m not joking.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As I explained the things I witnessed his expression morphed into one of horror.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They were completely naked?”

“Everything except the socks and then something got them.”

“What?”

“I don't know, but more of them are all over the school so we need to get the hell out of here fast.”

“But there’s a blizzard outside.”

“I know. Damn it, if only we had our phones.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Due to Principal Hogan pawning off confiscated electronics for drug money, students left theirs at home. The school did have an emergency landline. However, given the weather, it was likely calls wouldn’t be possible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We need someone who can drive us,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was only one person in the whole school who would be able to.  Dustin Knox was regarded as the school bully. Teachers hated him and he’d fight just about anybody who did so much as glanced at him wrong. He was known to only show up to school when he felt like it and he never got along with anybody.  For some reason, Calvin and I were the only exception to this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While I wouldn’t describe us as friends we did seem to be one of the few people he could tolerate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is he even here, though?” Calvin asked.

“Yeah, he has to be, as part of his probation.” I don't know where his class is, though.”

“I do. I think he has health class this period.”

“Of course he does.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The health wing was located at the upper level on the other side of the building. With those things roaming around, our work was cut out for us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What the hell are you two doing in here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We jumped at the sharpness of that voice. It was our school security officer. He was overweight and shaped similar to a potato. We started to explain ourselves to him as he rolled his eyes. Our breath caught in our throat upon seeing a tentacle slither into the bathroom. Frantically, we pointed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, that’s enough. Get your awol asses back to class before I-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The tentacle pierced through his back. He let out a choked gasp as he was lifted in the air while we both cursed. Then more of the creature came in, [blocking](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) the [exit.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222) and that’ll do for now. I’ll post how we got out of it tomorrow, but I can hear that my pizza’s done.
