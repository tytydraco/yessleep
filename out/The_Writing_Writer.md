I’ve finally done it. Created words that move. 
They show you things, not just in your imagination but like they’re truly there.

That was part of the blurb on my previous novel 
“The Baphomet Doctrine”. 
It told the story of an ex novelist turned preacher whose book sales had declined, not having what he once had according to publishers. 
One night when he was watching late tv, he came across a channel with a crazy preacher in a hall full of people, holding his hand out to their foreheads and pushing them while shouting “HEAL!” 

It gave him an idea. 
To create like always but with a twist. 

Becoming a preacher, his church based on one of his own creations instead of an existing god, he decided to see if he could convert people into his own twisted little believers. 

“Church of The Balance” is the title he gave it, built from ruins of an abandoned old cathedral. 
Keeping some of the old walls, knocking down others, he found a stone tablet hidden within one with strange runes carved crudely in. 
He thought nothing of it and continued to rebuild and eventually live in the church. 

Surprisingly to everyone, people started to show up and listen to his random ramblings and soon enough he had at least 30 - 40 people coming every Sunday. 
In between sermons, he would write about the god of the balance. 
What it wanted with people was to be true to themselves, what it would give in return, balance. 
Balance to all everything in all living things. 

He’d write random little stories about the being and of people who lived in its time that would eventually become his bible. 
But one day, weird things started to happen. 
Burned effigies of various figures appeared throughout the grounds, skinless creatures appeared in his flock, and a herd of goats managed to chew through the thick wooden door. 

Eventually realising they were events and beings he wrote about in his bible, he tried burning the pages to stop whatever madness was happening. 
They didn’t burn, they couldn’t. The power of the tablet he found was using some archaic magic to make his words become real. 
He managed to fight off the fear and continued to write, slowly growing power mad, knowing he could literally change the world around him as he saw fit. 
So wrote himself into a god. 

Q: Why have you told us the plot and spoilers?
A: You won’t have chance to read it. 

Q: Why won’t I?
A: It’s complicated. 

The blurb I wrote has became real, just like the character’s writings. 
The Preacher somehow became real in this world. In our world. 
I don’t know how, I have no magic rock, I just like writing. 
Then he came to me, spoke of forcing the world into his story, his ink, this world being in need of balance too. 

I wish I never wrote that story. 
My creation is now somehow everything you wouldn’t want him to be with a real bloodlust for us all, determined to force his visions of balance upon us. 
The transformation was one of the scariest things I’ve ever been through, it was beautiful, pain and pleasure coursed through my veins simultaneously.
I’m now all you can think of, human and animal, peace and chaos, music and silence, the Devil and God. 

That’s it! 
That’s how I’ll stop him, I’ll write him out. 
I’m the god of this story now. 
I’ve actually created words that move.
