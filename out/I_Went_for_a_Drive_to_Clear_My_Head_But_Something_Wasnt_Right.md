Ever since I got my full license and could drive on my own, I’d head out late at night to clear my head or just unwind. I’d sneak out of my room, careful not to make any noise, grab my coat, boots, phone, and wallet, and then drive off to some back roads. I’d usually be gone for just one or two hours—enough time to drive somewhere, park, and unwind before heading back. I kept this to myself. During the drive, I’d maybe see one or two other cars, and I almost never encountered anyone when I got to my destination. These drives usually happened around 2 or 3 a.m., when most people weren’t out, and that’s exactly what I wanted.

Anyways, I’m writing this after getting home from one of those drives, and I’m hoping someone here can help me make sense of it—or at least tell me if I’m going crazy.


It was the same as any other night. I got out of bed, threw on some clothes, grabbed my coat, boots, keys, wallet, and phone—just like always—and stepped out into the snowy night. I walked over to my car, unlocked it, started the engine, and waited for it to warm up before heading out.

While I waited, I rubbed my hands together, trying to keep warm. I always felt a little vulnerable, just sitting there in the car, waiting for it to heat up. So I kept glancing around, checking to see if my parents had noticed or if anyone was walking around, even though it was late. But like every other night, there was no one around. No one to see me start up the car. And once I pulled out of the driveway, it was the same—still no one around.

I drove out of the neighborhood and onto the main road. After a while, I turned off and made my way down the back roads. The pavement grew more uneven, the houses spaced farther apart, until they were almost entirely replaced by forest. I lived in the countryside, so it didn’t take long to get away from society.

I was driving down a road I’d been on plenty of times before. As I approached a bend, I noticed what looked like another set of headlights through the trees—nothing unusual, I’d see cars every now and then. But when I rounded the bend, there was no one there. There weren’t any turnoffs on the road, so I figured it must’ve been my headlights reflecting off something in the woods.

But as I kept driving, the feeling of unease started to creep in. It felt like I kept seeing more headlights—vanishing in and out of sight, like they were just out of reach. I told myself it was nothing, just a trick of the light, or maybe cars parked off to the side, turning off their headlights before I could spot them. It was pretty dark out, and unless something was right in front of me or had its own light, it was hard to see anything.

A few miles later, I parked at my usual spot. I sat there for a minute, trying to shake off the feeling. It was just weird reflections. Nothing to worry about.


I sat in the car for a moment, trying to shake off the unease. I’d been out here enough times to know that in the silent darkness, your mind can play tricks on you—something about trying to stimulate itself when there’s nothing else to focus on. Still, something about tonight felt different. The headlights seemed too real to be just tricks, but they had to be. I couldn’t think of any logical reason for what I was seeing.

After a few minutes, I decided to get out. The cold air hit me as I opened the door, biting at my skin. The silence was suffocating, and I immediately regretted leaving the warmth of the car. The snow crunched under my boots as I paced around, trying to shake off the feeling that I wasn’t alone. Tonight felt different; I’d never felt this uneasy before. I laughed a little at myself, trying to brush it off. There was nothing around—just trees, snow, and the quiet whisper of the wind.

I looked back at the car, my thoughts lingering on the road and those headlights. My eyes automatically scanned the trees around me, expecting to see some movement. But there was nothing. No cars, no lights, just the same endless dark. After taking a few deep breaths of the cool night air, I went back to the car, planning to head home.

I got back into the driver’s seat and checked all my mirrors. In the rearview, there was a set of unmistakable headlights. They had to be real; there was nothing else. I stared at them, not taking my eyes off the reflection as they grew closer. Eventually, the car passed by me. I glanced over at it as it went by—a blue truck, a middle-aged man wearing a high-vis jacket 

As he passed, he briefly looked in my direction, and something about his gaze felt off. I can’t quite describe it, but if you’ve ever seen those uncanny valley videos online, you’ll know what I mean. He looked human, but there was something about him that made him feel not human.

I couldn’t ignore it anymore—the vanishing headlights, the constant unease, and now this guy in the truck. I put my car in drive and started heading home, but it felt like I was being followed. I saw more headlights ahead, which usually brought me a sense of relief on most nights, but tonight, they only scared me. Each time I got close enough, they would vanish. I glanced in my mirrors, and there they were again—more lights. With each pair of headlights I saw, my panic grew.

Eventually, my dashboard lights turned off, and my headlights dimmed before shutting off completely. My battery had died. I managed to pull over to the side of the road, but there I was, alone in the middle of the woods, with my car dead, and my anxiety spiraling out of control. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong, and my paranoia only grew with the silence surrounding me.
 
I zipped up my coat, put on my gloves and hat, and looked under the hood, using my phone’s flashlight to see. But I knew it was hopeless—I knew nothing about cars. The most I could do was fix a flat tire, and recharging a battery was out of my league. I closed the hood and checked for service, and as expected, no bars.

I stood outside my car, now hoping to see headlights. I saw a few, but like before, they appeared and then vanished. This happened a few times, and then I noticed it—the silence. It was too quiet. It was always quiet out here, but there was usually something—birds, owls, something scurrying in the brush. But tonight, nothing. It was dead quiet. Not even the wind was making noise. No wildlife sounds. The leaves swayed, but the forest was eerily still.

It wasn’t until I saw headlights again that the silence was broken. I could tell these lights were different because they were accompanied by the hum of an engine. I got up and waved my arms, and the truck stopped. A big guy stepped out. I explained my situation, saying I thought my battery had died. He popped the hood, using his phone to illuminate it, and said, “Yeah, looks that way, bud. I’ve got some jumper cables in my truck. I can fix you up, and you’ll be on your way.”

I thanked him profusely. Not only had this man stopped to help, but he didn’t seem like some creature, like the guy in the other truck. After a bit, he had my battery charged up with the jumper cables—whatever those were—and I didn’t really understand the mechanics, but I knew my car was fixed, and I could finally go home.

 As he finished up, I thanked him again, and he gave me a nod before getting back into his truck. As he started the engine and began to pull away, he glanced over at me one last time. His eyes lingered a little too long, just a bit too steady. Then, as if realizing he was staring, he quickly turned his gaze back to the road. But it wasn’t the look itself—it was the way he moved. It felt… off. There was something deliberate about it, like he knew more than he was letting on.

Before he drove off completely, he called out from the window, “Take care, Aiden. Stay safe out here, alright?”

The words were casual, but the use of my name—how did he know my name? I hadn’t told him, and I sure hadn’t seen him before. It wasn’t anything overt, nothing that would make anyone suspect anything too strange at first. But something in the way he said it, like he had no reason to know it but did anyway—it sent a chill down my spine.

As his headlights disappeared into the dark, I stood there frozen for a few moments, trying to make sense of it. The silence seemed thicker now, the shadows longer. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone, that I was still being watched.

But I drove home, and this time, no headlights appeared. No cars. The night was completely silent, but sometimes, I thought I heard whispers from the forest, like it knew I was noticing things I shouldn’t. The stillness. The guy in the truck. The man calling my name.

As I drove, the whispers seemed to grow louder. They were incoherent, but they felt… angry. I could barely take it, the weight of the tension pressing down on me. But then, just as suddenly as it had started, it stopped.

I approached the highway again, and the familiar sight of houses began to reappear. The entrance to my neighborhood loomed in the distance, a welcome sight.

I parked my car, went inside, and came straight to my room. It’s 3 AM now, and I still haven’t been able to sleep. Every time I hear a creak in the house or something outside, I flinch. I don’t know if what I saw on those roads was real, or if that man really did have something wrong with his face. Did I tell the other guy my name? What were the whispers? Can someone please help me understand what happened? Is there any explanation for any of this?

Small update: I was about to post this when I noticed a truck parked outside my house, across the road. I’m pretty sure it’s the blue truck from the woods.
