I've been applying to jobs like crazy and had a few interviews lined up, as well as a few I still needed to follow up on. Slow progress. Being jobless fucking sucks.



I haven’t been able to shake what happened [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1m1f6cu/i_keep_getting_told_i_look_like_different_people/). That thing in my car came out of nowhere, and nearly made me crash the car.



What the fuck was that thing? Am I going insane?



Zoey and my mom have noticed that I've been stressed out lately, and they're doing their best to comfort me to the best of their ability.



While I appreciated them, it didn't take away from the fact that my savings were depleting, and the bills were still piling up. My mom and I were in the kitchen discussing this.



That's when Zoey came up and did the cutest thing that nearly broke my heart. She had some crumpled bills in the palm of her hand.



She said, "Dad, I got this money from the tooth fairy, I want you to have it!"



I almost cried, I really don’t deserve her.



"No, sweetie. You keep it. You're too sweet." I tossed my hand through her hair, and she went to the living room with her Switch to play Mario Kart.



My mom told me, "James, have you followed up with anybody yet?"



"Yeah, I was actually gonna go to a couple places today and ask," I responded.



I didn't want to talk about this right now, and she must’ve caught on to my reluctant attitude.



"Okay, well, you're gonna need something soon." She said, crossing her arms.



"I know, mom." I retorted.



"Maybe you could apply for unemployment for the time being?" She suggested.



“That's like so much extra work to deal with all that. Not even worth it." I started to get annoyed.



"Alright, well, I'm just trying to help. You could take this a little more seriously." She said,



I was fed up. "I'm fucking trying, mom. It's not easy."



I started to get tunnel vision again. Was this a fucking trigger or something?



She raised her hands, "James, I understand you're upset. I get it, alright? It's going to be okay, though. So please don't get mad at me."



The tunnel vision reduced my vision to a pinpoint. Seconds later, I was in my car. Weird.



I was just in the kitchen arguing with my mom, but whatever. I guess that situation resolved itself.



Time to go job hunting. I made my way down to Colorado Springs. I had a lead on a possible hire in the downtown area.



I got out of my car and paid for parking. The place was a few blocks down. Since it was Saturday, parking was abysmal.



I started walking down the street. It was nice out today; clear skies and a cool breeze.



The past few weeks have been pretty rainy. Personally, I preferred the rainy weather more, but this was still nice.



I met eyes with a girl walking down the street. She glanced back at me.



She then quickly shot her eyes back at me for a second look. She looked shell-shocked, like she had just seen a ghost.



She ran up to me and grabbed my face with both hands.



"Michael, is that you? I can't believe this!" she said.



Her breathing became faster; I had no idea what was happening.



"It's been so long… we all thought you died. I haven't been the same since you went missing."



With tears in her eyes, she looked me in the eyes, genuinely believing that I was her Michael.



"I missed you so fucking much, I can't believe you're back. What happened? Where did you go?"



“I, uh-”



Before I could say anything, she kissed me. A kiss so passionate that I sort of wished I was Michael at that moment.



Our locking lips separated, and then she started to analyze me. Her eyes darted all across the face she was still holding in her hands.



She looked puzzled for a second, followed by surprise, then a clear feeling of anger and betrayal.



"Wait a second… Who the fuck are you?" She exclaimed.



She let go of my face and pushed me back.



"Who the fuck are you?! Where's Michael? Tell me!" She started screaming.



This wasn't good. People have mistaken me for loved ones or friends in the past. But not to this extent.



I didn't know what to do other than stand there. Suddenly, as if on queue, fucking tunnel vision.



She kept screaming at me as I faded from reality. All I could get out was, “I’m sorry…”



Everything faded to black. I caught a vision of mangled corpses melting in a pool of fire. Blood-curdling screams replaced the whispering that had cursed me before.



Then, suddenly, I woke up shaking the hand of a man.



"We'll call you when everything is finalized. Can't wait to have you on board." Said the man.



Guess I got the job. I thanked him, and left.



Making my way back to my car was terrifying. I felt that at any moment, I could run into her again.



I felt so guilty about that poor woman. I know I didn’t do anything, but I felt horrible. Almost like I was teasing her with the chance of seeing her significant other again.



I'm so sick of this shit. Thankfully, I didn't see her again and safely got to my car.



Just more trauma that I need to repress. I had to shake it off, I had a date tonight with Jennifer.



I was excited to tell Mom and Zoey the good news: the job actually paid really well! Still, I needed some profound sleep tonight.



I got home, told them, and of course, they were ecstatic. I was, too. Finally, some good news.



I got myself ready for the date; well I say date but really I was just going over to her place to fuck. The way we were talking got real sexual real quick, and honestly I don’t even remember half of the text conversations when I looked at them.



I’ll spare the more intimate details and skip to when we were laying in her bed and talking afterwards.



“So, you have a daughter?” Jennifer asked,



“Yeah, guess I didn’t go into too much detail about that part.” I replied with a laugh.



“It’s alright! It’s not a problem for me or anything, I happen to find dads quite sexy…” she said,



“As long as you don’t mind the dad bod.” I chuckled awkwardly.



“I love it. But can I ask, and please tell me if you’re not comfortable talking about it, what happened to the mom? I’m just curious.” she asked me.



“Well, there’s nothing really wrong. Like, nothing bad happened between us. I got her pregnant, and I was there for her every step of the way. I thought things were going great between us…”



I noticed a shadow in the open bedroom door leading to the hallway. Something was crouching out there and staring at me intently.



She saw me staring out there, and looked in that direction in confusion. I had to bring the conversation back.



“Sorry, I just spaced out for a second. Anyway, when Zoey was born, I thought we were gonna be one big happy family. But a few months after, I came back to find a note and Zoey by herself. She wasn’t ready for the commitment of a family, and just left… Left, before I could say or do anything about it.” I said,



“Oh my god, that’s horrible. I’m so sorry, I can’t imagine just abandoning your family like that.” She responded.



“It’s alright, don’t apologize on my behalf. I mean, me and her are doing just fine without her. Zoey is happy, and that’s all that matters to me.”



Eventually, I had to get dressed and head back to my place. We kissed each other goodbye as I got in my car again and drove home.



Later in the afternoon, I noticed that my daughter was drawing stuff at the dining room table like usual. Zoey was surprisingly decent at drawing for someone her age.



Passing by, I glanced down at what she was doodling. It was a family drawing. Zoey, my mother, and I were holding hands in front of the house.



Something that would usually be sweet and touching to any parent if I hadn’t noticed one unsettling detail.



Everyone in the drawing had a face except for me.



"What's going on there, buddy?” I asked,



“You forgot to draw my face in."



"No, I didn't, I just didn't know which face to draw for you, Daddy." She responded, still giddy as if what she just said didn't send a chill down my spine.



"Oh… Okay, well, it looks good!" I walked away immediately after that into the bathroom.



I started to hyperventilate. What the fuck is going on with me lately. This isn't normal.



This isn't some random coincidence anymore. Something was seriously wrong with me.



I don’t understand. Things were finally going in a good direction for me.



I got a fantastic job that started soon. I was talking to a beautiful woman who was fully interested in me, and I had the loving support of my mom and daughter.



Life should be good right now. So why am I so fucked up lately??



I had to stop myself from looking in the mirror again



That one instance with the mirror I described was by far the worst one. But on a few separate occasions, I have noticed something slightly off with my reflection again since.



My face would blur for a brief second, or my reflection would lag to catch up with me. Almost like it was impersonating me.



Lately, I've started to avoid looking in mirrors. After that episode in the bathroom the other night, I don't want to look at myself right now.



I started to blackout again. This time when everything faded out, I perceived swirling fire wrapping around a dark monolith.



I woke up in the forest in the dead of night, and Jennifer’s mangled corpse was sprawled out in front of me. Her limbs and head had all been chopped off.



I couldn’t believe my eyes, my lover was dead right before my eyes. Was this real?



This can’t be real, I have to be imagining shit again! She can’t be dead. She can’t be dead.



This can’t be happening, what the fuck happened? It was real, she was gone.



I frantically looked around for any answer, and I saw a shadowy figure off in the distance walking away with a flashlight. I got up and charged in their direction, all the while I saw dark silhouettes hiding behind trees and peering at me.



I continued, and as soon as I approached the source of light, all I saw was a flashlight lying on the ground. Its beams stretched out beyond the trees.



Where did that son of a bitch go? I swore I would kill the motherfucker who did this to my love.



Intensely observing my surroundings, I didn’t see anything or anyone. After some time, I stumbled my way back to where I thought I was when I found her.



All I found upon returning were puddles of blood soaking into the dirt. Her body was missing.



I blacked out again, and woke up in my room covered in dirt. I have no idea if what I just saw was real or not.



What do I do? Should I call the police? What would I even tell them…



Would they even believe me? Did she really die? I’m praying to God that this was just another horrifying vision.



It can’t be real. It can’t be real. It can’t be real.
