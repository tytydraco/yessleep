The house smelled like wet wool and Jim Beam. It was a gray box at the end of a dirt road that washed out every spring.

Inside the walls were bare. There were nails sticking out of the plaster in the hallway but nothing hanging on them. In the bathroom there was one toothbrush in the cup and a bar of gritty soap that smelled like pumice.

It was just me and Dad.

Dad was a big guy, broad shouldered and heavy. He worked at the lumber yard. He came home every day at 5:30 with sawdust caught in his eyebrows.
We had a routine. He would wash his hands at the kitchen sink, scrubbing until his skin was red. Then he would heat up dinner. Usually it was chili from a can or hot dogs boiled in water. We ate standing up at the counter.

"How was school?" he’d ask.

"Fine," I’d say.

"Learn anything?"

"Math."

"Good."

That was it. That was the window of time where he was my dad.

At 6:30 he would put his plate in the sink. He would walk to the cabinet above the refrigerator and take down the square bottle. Then he would grab a glass and go to the table.
The kitchen table was small, pushed right up against the wall. He dragged his chair around so he wasn't facing the room. He faced the window.
Our backyard was overgrown. Just waist high weeds and an old rusted swing set I wasn't allowed to touch. Along the back fence there was a massive tangle of wild rose bushes. A wall of thorns.
Dad sat there and watched those roses.
He poured the whiskey. No ice. He drank it like it was medicine.

By the second glass the air in the house got heavy.
He didn't yell right away. He just stopped moving. He would stare at the window glass, tapping his finger against the table over and over again.
I knew that rhythm. That rhythm meant I needed to be invisible.

I would take my toy cars into the living room. I learned to roll them on the rug because if I rolled them on the hardwood floor it made a rumble. If I made a rumble Dad would snap.

"Quiet," he’d bark, not even turning around.
So I played in silence. I built towers out of magazines and knocked them down in slow motion so they wouldn't crash.
It was boring. Being afraid is mostly just being bored. You sit there with your knees pulled to your chest waiting for the grown up to pass out so you can go to the bathroom without getting yelled at.

I didn't have anyone to talk to. No brothers. No sisters. No friends allowed over because "the house is a mess" even though the house was empty.
That’s why I wasn't scared when I saw the shadow.
It was a Tuesday. It had been raining for three days. The roof was leaking in the bathroom, dripping into a bucket with a steady, maddening rhythm.
Dad was on his third glass. He was muttering at the window.

I was behind the sofa. I looked up toward the hallway.
There was something standing in the doorway.
It was huge. It had to hunch its shoulders to fit under the frame. It wore a long, brown robe that looked stiff, like dried mud.

It took a step. The heavy fabric crunched like crumbling paper.
I pressed myself against the back of the sofa. I stopped breathing.
The thing stepped into the living room light.
Its face was a dark, shiny purple. It was swollen tight, like a balloon about to pop. It didn't have eyes, just two puffy slits. It didn't have a nose. Its mouth hung open, crooked, dangling to the left.

It breathed with a wet, bubbling rattle.
I stared at it. I waited for it to grab me.
It didn't. It just stood there, swaying back and forth.
It turned its head. It looked toward the kitchen.
Dad was ten feet away. He was staring at the window, swirling his drink.

"Dad?" I whispered.

He didn't hear me.

But the thing did.

The purple head turned. It ground on its neck. It looked down at me.
I squeezed my eyes shut.
I heard the crunch of the stiff robe getting closer. I smelled wet dirt and old pennies.
Then I felt a cold touch on my head.
It patted my hair. It was a jerky, awkward motion.
I opened one eye.

The thing was kneeling in front of me. The swollen purple face was inches away. A string of spit hung from its crooked mouth.

It patted me again.

Dad coughed in the kitchen. The thing stood up unfolding like a spider and stepped back into the dark hallway.
I touched my hair. It felt cold.
He came back the next night. And the night after that.

I named him Mr. Purple Face.

He usually showed up around 7:00 when Dad was deep in the bottle. He would stand in the corner by the TV watching.
I realized pretty quick that Dad couldn't see him. Dad would walk right past him to get to the bathroom. He’d shiver, rub his arms, maybe mutter about a draft but he never looked up.

Mr. Purple Face became my secret.

I started talking to him.

"This is my red truck," I’d whisper holding it up.
Mr. Purple Face would lean down. He’d make that clicking sound deep in his throat.
One night Dad was really bad. He had lost his keys. He was tearing the living room apart throwing cushions on the floor.

"Where are they?" he screamed. He pointed a finger at me. "You took them."

"I didn't," I said.

"Don't lie to me." He took a step toward me. His face was red. He raised his hand.

I flinched.

Suddenly Mr. Purple Face moved.

He stepped out of the corner. He moved fast. He stood right between me and Dad. He spread his arms out wide.
Dad stopped. He blinked. He looked confused. He looked right at Mr. Purple Face's chest.
"Jesus," Dad muttered. He rubbed his face. "It's freezing in here."

He turned around and stumbled back to the kitchen.
Mr. Purple Face turned to me. He knelt down. He patted my head.
He stayed there all night standing guard by the sofa.
For two years that was my life. Me, Dad, and the guardian in the hallway.

But when I turned seven things changed.
The rain started and didn't stop. The backyard turned into a swamp.
And Dad stopped going to work.
When Dad stopped going to work the house felt different. It felt smaller.

Before, I had the mornings to myself. I had the time between getting off the bus and him coming home to watch TV and eat snacks and pretend I was a normal kid. But after he lost his job those hours were gone.
He said he got laid off. He said the foreman was an idiot who didn't know good lumber from scrap. But even at seven years old I knew that wasn't true. I knew he got fired because he started smelling like whiskey at breakfast.

He didn't leave the house anymore. He moved his life to the kitchen table.

He stopped eating. I would come into the kitchen in the morning and the can of chili I opened the night before would still be sitting on the counter. The sauce would be dried out and dark.

He just drank. And he watched the yard.

It was November and the rain had started. It wasn't a storm. It was just a steady gray drizzle that never stopped. The dirt road turned into sludge. The backyard, which was already overgrown, started to look like a swamp.

The water pooled around the swing set. It made the weeds look black and slimy.
Dad became obsessed with it. He would sit there with his forehead pressed against the cold glass fogging it up with his breath.

"Look at it," he would mutter. "Just look at that mess."
I would stand in the doorway holding my cereal bowl. "Look at what?"

"The mud," he said. "It's washing everything out. It's going to ruin the fence line."

He turned to look at me. His eyes were red rimmed and he hadn't shaved in a week. His face looked gray.

"Don't go out there," he said.

"I won't," I said. "It's raining."

"I mean it," he said. He grabbed the edge of the table. "I don't want you tracking that filth into the house. If I see you near that mud I'll wear you out."

He wasn't yelling. He said it quiet like he was giving me advice. That was scarier than the yelling.
I went back to the living room.
Mr. Purple Face was there.
He had changed too.
In the beginning he was calm. He was just a statue that stood in the corner. But now that Dad was home all day Mr. Purple Face was restless.

He wouldn't stay in the living room. He walked up and down the hallway dragging that stiff brown robe on the carpet. He would walk to the edge of the kitchen, stand there for a minute, and then turn around.
He seemed agitated. The wet rattling sound in his throat was louder. It sounded like water bubbling in a pot.

He started spending a lot of time by the kitchen door. He would stand just out of Dad’s sight line. He would lean his swollen purple head against the doorframe and watch Dad drink.

Sometimes he would raise a gray hand and reach out toward Dad. He didn't touch him. He just held his hand in the air like he was trying to grab something he couldn't reach.

I tried to ignore it. I tried to play with my cars. But the air in the house was too tight. It felt like a rubber band that was pulled too far.
On Thursday the power went out.
It was the middle of the day but the sky was so dark it looked like night. The rain was coming down harder now. I could hear it hitting the roof.
Dad didn't move when the lights went out. He was staring at the yard.

"It never stops," he whispered. "Why won't it stop?"
He stood up. The chair scraped against the floor.
He walked to the back door and opened it. The wind blew rain into the kitchen. It soaked the front of his shirt but he didn't seem to notice.
He stood there gripping the doorframe staring at the rose bushes.

"Hey!" he yelled.

It was the first time I heard him scream at the yard.
"That's my property!" he screamed. "Get off my property!"

I was hiding behind the sofa. I looked out the window. There was nobody in the yard. It was just rain and weeds.

"I see you!" Dad yelled at the empty yard. "You think I don't see you? I know what you're doing!"
Mr. Purple Face stepped out of the hallway.
He walked past me. He didn't look at me this time. He moved fast.

He walked right into the kitchen.

The gray light from the open door hit him. His skin looked wet. The purple face shone like oil.
He walked up behind Dad. He stood so close his chest was almost touching Dad’s back.
Dad was still screaming at the rain. "Get away from there! Leave it alone!"

Mr. Purple Face leaned down. He put his face right next to Dad’s ear.

I thought he was going to bite him. I thought he was going to tear Dad’s throat out.

But he didn't.

He just opened his mouth. The crooked jaw hung loose.

He breathed. A loud, wet rattle right in Dad’s ear.
Dad froze.

He stopped screaming mid-word. He went rigid.
He slapped his hand over his ear like a bug had flown into it. He spun around.

Mr. Purple Face was standing right there. He was towering over Dad.

But Dad looked right through him.
Dad looked at the empty air where Mr. Purple Face’s chest was. He looked around the kitchen wild eyed.
"Who's there?" Dad whispered. "Who did that?"
Mr. Purple Face didn't move. He just stared down at Dad with those swollen shut eyes.

Dad backed up until he hit the counter. He was breathing hard. He looked terrified.

"Is someone in here?" Dad yelled. His voice cracked. "I'll call the cops! I have a gun!"

He didn't have a gun.

He grabbed the whiskey bottle off the table and held it like a club.

"Show yourself!" Dad screamed.

Mr. Purple Face leaned forward again. He reached out a long gray finger. He poked Dad in the chest.
Dad gasped. He looked down at his shirt. He touched the spot where the finger had hit him.

"Cold," Dad whimpered. "It's so cold."

Dad ran. He didn't run at the ghost. He ran past him. He scrambled out of the kitchen and ran down the hall to his bedroom. He slammed the door so hard the pictures on the wall shook.

I heard the lock click.

I was left alone in the living room.

Mr. Purple Face turned around. He looked at me.
He didn't look scary anymore. He looked sad.
He walked over to where I was hiding. He crumpled down to the floor. His stiff robe crunched.

He reached out and took my hand. His fingers were freezing.

We sat there for a long time listening to the rain and the sound of Dad crying in his bedroom.
That weekend was the longest of my life.
Dad didn't come out of his room for a day. I had to eat peanut butter out of the jar with a spoon.
When he finally came out he looked worse. His eyes were sunk deep in his head. He was shaking.
He went straight to the kitchen. He didn't even look at me. He opened a new bottle.

He sat at the table and resumed his watch.
The rain didn't stop. It just kept coming. The backyard was a lake now. The water was brown and muddy.
On Monday night I woke up.

It was quiet. The rain had slowed down to a drizzle.
I heard a sound in the living room. It sounded like scratching.

I got out of bed and crept to the door.
Mr. Purple Face was standing at the back door in the kitchen.

Dad had finally passed out. He was slumped over the table his head resting on his arms. He was snoring.
Mr. Purple Face was standing right next to him. But he wasn't looking at Dad.

He was looking at the door.

He was scratching at the wood with his gray fingernails.

He wanted out.

I walked into the kitchen. I stayed near the wall so I wouldn't wake Dad up.

"Mr. Purple Face?" I whispered.

He stopped scratching. He turned his swollen head toward me.

He pointed at the door. Then he pointed at the lock.
He wanted me to open it.

I shook my head. "Dad said no," I whispered. "Dad said I can't go near the mud."

Mr. Purple Face tilted his head. He made a soft sound. It wasn't the rattle. It sounded like a whimper.
He pointed at the door again.

Then he pointed at the rose bushes out in the dark yard.

He just pointed. His gray finger rested on the glass.
I looked out. I couldn't see anything. It was just black shapes and rain.

"Is something out there?" I asked.

Mr. Purple Face didn't answer. He just stared at the yard.
He stood there for a long time. Then he lowered his hand. He looked defeated.
He turned back to the window and just watched the darkness.

I went back to bed.

The next day was Tuesday. The day everything ended.

Tuesday night was when it ended.

It was raining hard. The sound of it hitting the roof was loud enough to drown out the TV.
I went to bed early because Dad was in a mood. He had been pacing the kitchen for hours, muttering to himself. He had finished one bottle and started another.

I put my pillow over my head but I could still hear his heavy footsteps vibrating through the floor.
I fell asleep eventually.

I woke up because the door to my bedroom slammed open.

The hallway light was on. Dad was standing in my doorway. He looked huge. His shirt was unbuttoned and stained with sweat. He was holding the neck of the whiskey bottle in his right hand.

"Get up," he said.

His voice was thick. He was drunker than I had ever seen him.

I sat up. I was shaking. "What?"

"Get up!" he yelled. "Stop hiding in here."

He came into the room. He grabbed my arm. His grip was bruising. He dragged me out of bed.

"Dad, you're hurting me," I cried.

"Shut up," he spat. "I'm sick of you sneaking around. I'm sick of you looking at me like that."

He pulled me down the hallway. I tried to dig my heels into the carpet but he was too strong. He dragged me into the kitchen.

The bright fluorescent lights hummed overhead. The back door was cracked open just a little bit, letting the cold rain blow in.

He shoved me toward the corner. I slipped on the linoleum and fell hard on my knees.

"Please," I whispered.

Dad didn't hear me. He was breathing hard, his face red and twisted. He looked at me with pure hate. It wasn't about the rain. It wasn't about the yard. He just wanted to hurt something.

"I give you a roof over your head," he shouted. "And you just sit there. You judge me."

He raised the bottle. He held it like a club.

He took a step toward me. He pulled his arm back to swing.

I curled into a ball on the floor. I squeezed my eyes shut and covered my head with my hands.

I waited for the glass to hit me.

But it didn't.

The air in the kitchen changed. It smelled like wet dirt.

I opened my eyes.

Mr. Purple Face was standing over me.

He had stepped out of the shadows. He was standing between me and Dad. He was facing Dad.
He looked huge under the kitchen lights. His brown robe was stiff and wet. Mud was dripping off the hem onto the clean floor.

He had his arms spread out wide. He was shielding me.

Dad stopped mid swing.

He blinked. He looked at the space in front of him.
At first he looked confused. He squinted like he couldn't focus on the thing standing there.
Then his eyes got wide.

He dropped the bottle. It shattered on the floor. Brown whiskey splashed over his boots.

Dad took a step back. His mouth opened but no sound came out.

"You," Dad whispered.

He looked up at the swollen purple face. He looked at the flat nose. He looked at the crooked jaw hanging loose.

Dad let out a sound that didn't sound human. It was a high pitched squeak.

"No," Dad said. He held his hands up in front of his face. "No. Stay back."

Mr. Purple Face took a step forward. He leaned down. He put his face right in front of Dad’s face.

Dad screamed.

It was a scream of pure terror. He scrambled backward. He slipped on the wet floor and fell hard. He crab walked backward into the corner by the stove.

"Get away!" Dad shrieked. He was kicking his legs at the air. "Don't touch me! Stay away from me!"
Mr. Purple Face just stood there blocking me.
Dad was curled up in a ball covering his head. He was sobbing. He was screaming about rocks and dirt.
"I put you back!" Dad yelled. "I put you back!"
I stayed on the floor behind Mr. Purple Face. I didn't move.

Then I saw blue lights flashing in the window.
The neighbors must have heard the screaming.
I heard the front door get kicked open. "Police! Police!"

Two officers ran into the kitchen. They had guns out.
They saw Dad in the corner screaming at the empty air. They saw the broken bottle. They saw me on the floor crying.

But they didn't see Mr. Purple Face.

"Drop the weapon!" one cop yelled at Dad, even though Dad wasn't holding anything.
Dad didn't hear them. He was pointing at Mr. Purple Face.

"She's right there!" Dad screamed. "She's right there! Don't let her touch me!"

The cops grabbed him. They wrestled him onto his stomach. They put handcuffs on him.
Dad was still screaming. "She came up! The rain washed her up!"

A lady officer came over to me. She picked me up. She carried me out of the kitchen.

As we walked down the hall I looked back over her shoulder.

Mr. Purple Face was still standing in the kitchen. He was watching them take Dad away.

He raised one gray hand and waved at me.
Then he stepped back into the shadows.
I sat in the back of a police car wrapped in a blanket. I watched them put Dad in another car.
I thought he was going to jail for trying to hit me. I thought he was going to jail for being drunk.
I didn't know the real reason. Not then.
Social services took me that night. A few days later, my grandparents came to get me. My mom's parents. I hadn't seen them since I was a baby.

They took me to their house three towns over. It was quiet there. Safe.

I never went back to the house at the end of the dirt road.

I lived with my grandparents until I was eighteen.
They were good people. They lived in a brick house three towns over. They had a golden retriever and a backyard with a pool. There were no weeds. There were no roses.

They never talked about my dad. They never talked about the house at the end of the dirt road.
I went to therapy for a few years. The shrink told me I had an over active imagination. She said Mr Purple Face was a “coping mechanism.” She said I created a protector because my father was scary and I was lonely.

It made sense. I wanted it to be true. So I believed her.

I grew up. I went to college. I got a job in IT. I tried to be normal.

I didn’t think about the house for a long time.
Last week my phone rang. It was a lawyer from the state.

He told me my father was dead.

He died in the infirmary at the state prison. His liver finally gave out.

I didn’t feel sad. I didn’t feel happy either. I just felt… nothing. It was like hearing about a stranger dying on the news.

The lawyer told me there were no assets. The house had been foreclosed on twenty years ago. There was no money.

“But,” the lawyer said, “there is a box of personal effects. He listed you as next of kin. Do you want it? Or should we dispose of it?”

I almost said dispose of it. I wanted to say it.
“Send it,” I said.

I don’t know why. Maybe I just needed to see it to believe he was really gone.

The box arrived yesterday. It was a small cardboard box taped shut with heavy packing tape.
I put it on my kitchen table. I stared at it for an hour before I got a knife.

I cut the tape.

It smelled like him. Even after twenty years it smelled like stale tobacco and mildew.

It was mostly trash. A cheap watch. A lighter. A stack of letters he wrote to me but never mailed. I didn’t read them.

At the bottom of the box there was a manila envelope.

I opened it. Inside was a stack of old Polaroids.
They were curling at the corners. The colors were faded and orange.

I flipped through them.

There was a picture of a truck I didn’t recognize. There was a picture of the lumber yard. There was a picture of me as a baby sitting on a blanket in the grass.

And then I found it.

The last photo in the stack.

It was taken in the kitchen. The old kitchen with the yellow linoleum and the fluorescent lights.
Dad was sitting at the table. He was younger. He wasn’t bloated from the drink yet. He was smiling at the camera holding up a beer.

Standing next to him with her arm around his shoulder was a woman.

My mother.

I had never seen a picture of her before. Grandparents didn’t keep any around.
She was small. She had dark hair and a shy smile. She looked happy.
But I stopped breathing when I saw what she was wearing.

It was a house coat. A long brown quilted robe that went down to her ankles.
In the photo it looked soft. It looked warm.
But I knew that robe.
I remembered the sound it made when it scraped the wall. I remembered how it dragged on the carpet. I remembered how stiff it was, caked in dried mud from the backyard.

I leaned in closer. I looked at the collar of the robe.
It had a pattern. Small stitched diamonds.
My hands started to shake. I remembered that pattern. I used to stare at that exact pattern when I was hiding behind the sofa praying for Dad to pass out.

I looked at her face.

It was smooth. It was unblemished. She had a small nose. She had bright eyes. She had a straight happy smile.

I closed my eyes.
Suddenly I was back in that living room.
I could smell the wet dirt. I could hear the wet rattling breath.

I could see the swollen purple skin. The flat nose. The crooked jaw hanging loose.

I remembered the way she stood between me and him. I remembered the way she spread her arms out to take up the space so he couldn’t get to me.
I put the photo down on the table.

For twenty years I thought she left me. Dad said she ran off. He said she didn’t want a family.

But she didn’t run off.

She was there the whole time. She was standing in the hallway watching him. She was waiting for the rain to wash the dirt away so she could come back inside.

She never left me.
