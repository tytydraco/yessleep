Part 1 | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lz8ygr/i_work_as_a_librarian_in_the_old_town_library_we/)

I have now worked for a week in my new job at the old city library-and a creeping suspicion has taken hold of me that this library conceals far more than meets the eye.

But I should start at the beginning.

My name is Clara. I am thirty-four years old and recently moved to this town to take up the position of the new librarian in the city’s ancient library.

This town is exactly what I had hoped for: small, silent, quaint. Cobblestone streets, houses with wooden shutters, a marketplace where merchants peddle various wares. Few people live here directly; most commute from surrounding villages. As a result, the streets often seem empty-even at midday.

Still, those I have met have been kind. Reserved, yes, but warm enough to feel welcome.

The job posting for the library came at just the right time.

I had recently ended a long-term relationship and found myself slipping into a kind of dark hole-not deep, but dark enough to make me realize I needed change. My old life no longer fit me. My friends were there, trying to help, but I felt the need to distance myself. A real fresh start. A place where I could breathe again.

When I saw the listing for the library-unassuming, without even a logo-I wasn’t sure if it was still valid. But I applied immediately. After a brief phone interview, I got the job. Three weeks later, I was here.

The library itself lies on the edge of the old town, it itself is old, beautiful, and seems somehow out of time-much like the town it inhabits.

It is an austere rectangular structure of dark sandstone, with tall rounded windows and a bell tower long since silenced. I was told it once belonged to the old university, which has since moved to a modern new building on the other side of town. Since then, it has been a public library, open to anyone who finds their way here.

The entrance is formed by two heavy wooden doors with wrought-iron handles. They are difficult to open-and even harder to close when alone.

On my first day, I arrived far too early. I had barely slept as I had always been nervous on “first days,” whether at school or in previous jobs. Thus, I found myself standing outside the building half an hour before opening.

The heavy doors resisted opening, and their hinges groaned loudly.

I looked around. A short corridor led from the entrance into the heart of the building.

On the left wall, several lockers were lined up-available to visitors for a small fee, to store bags, coats, or simply to free one’s hands.

Next to them stood two old-fashioned vending machines: one for coffee, the other for soda and snacks. Their hum was the only sound breaking the silence.

At the end of the corridor, the space opened wide and tall, dominated by endless bookshelves.

In the center stood the reception-a wooden podium with a gently curved counter jutting into the room like the helm of an ancient ship.

The shelves were divided by genre: fiction, history, philosophy, novels of many sorts. Many books were yellowed, their spines brittle, as if they had waited decades to be read. Between the shelves were open spaces with tables, chairs, and computers-modern, yet oddly out of place. The gray monitors and keyboards seemed alien amidst the dark wood and aged leather-bound volumes.

Behind the counter was a narrow staircase to the upper floor. The railing was wrought iron, black and ornately decorated, yet worn at the edges-as if it had been grasped by more hands than one could count.

The floor was dark wood-polished glassy in some places, dull and dust-filled in others. Light streamed in at a slant through the tall windows, revealing dust motes floating like ghosts. The scent was of old wood, leather, and paper-a smell I loved, one that always comforted me.

Behind the counter stood a woman scanning a stack of books. When she noticed me, she laid the book and scanner aside and approached.

She was perhaps in her late fifties, hair pulled back tightly, gray, with a gaze that immediately reminded me of my old English teacher-only wearier.

“You’re early,” she said, neither smiling nor reproaching. “That’s good.”

She scrutinized me briefly, then extended a bony hand.

“My name is Brandt.” A faint smile touched her lips. “Nice to meet you.”

“Clara,” I said quietly, returning her handshake. “Likewise, Mrs. Brandt,” I added awkwardly. I was never good at these moments.

“I’m glad you could come so quickly,” she said, turning back to the reception and beckoning me to follow.

“Since Mrs. Langley retired, the work here has piled up.”

She picked up the scanner again and resumed scanning books.

“Do you know how this works?”

She paused, looking at me with a mixture of patience and expectation.

“Yes, I have several years of experience as a librarian in my old town,” I replied.

“Oh, yes, I remember our conversation,” she murmured softly. “Excuse me. I’m not as young as I used to be and start forgetting things.” She stepped aside. “Come here. I’ll show you how our system works.”

I obeyed and stepped forward.

She scanned the book in her hand-a worn copy of *Moby Dick*—and pointed to the screen. “Here you see all the info you need: title, ISBN, which shelf and floor it belongs to, who borrowed it, and whether it was returned on time. You’re probably familiar with this.”

“Yes, we had a very similar system at my old library,” I said, relieved I wouldn’t have to learn a strange new program.

“That’s good,” Brandt sighed. “Let me briefly explain how your day usually goes.”

She pointed to a small slip pinned behind the counter.

“We officially open at nine, but I’m usually here half an hour earlier. Every evening, we empty the return box”-she gestured to a black, waist-high metal box by the counter-“and place the books here. First thing in the morning, we scan them, check for damage, and place them on carts sorted by floor.” If there’s a lot, it takes time.

I nodded.

“Mornings are quiet. Mostly pensioners or people studying for exams. That’s when we handle internal tasks: catalog maintenance, emails, orders.”

She paused and continued.

“Afternoons are busier. That’s when our part-timer, Lena, arrives to help. Sometimes we host events: readings, children’s groups, school classes.”

“Sounds doable,” I said.

“It is, once you get used to the silence.”

She smiled faintly.

“I’ll show you the library in more detail now. Come,” she said, grabbing an old, heavy keyring that clinked softly.

She stepped behind the counter, and I followed her through the narrow aisles between shelves.

The wood beneath our steps creaked softly, almost like a whisper. Between shelves were cozy nooks with old leather chairs and reading lamps casting dim pools of light.

The whole space was permeated by that scent I’d loved since childhood: dusty paper, old leather, a hint of dried ink. It smelled of… knowledge. And time.

“Most visitors stay down here,” Brandt said. “Upstairs are mostly reference books. Sometimes a student wanders up, but rarely anyone else.”

We turned back toward the reception, and she pointed to a door beside the main staircase-one I hadn’t noticed before.

A narrow metal frame painted a dull gray, with a small, worn button beside it.

“Thank God they installed this a few years ago,” she muttered, pressing the button. A mechanical beep sounded-too loud and new for this place.

The elevator shuddered to a stop and the doors slid open quietly.

“We used to carry all the books up and down by hand. For hours. Then they wanted to make the building accessible-at least they managed that.”

The elevator’s interior was tight, walls of cold metal. When the doors closed, I felt oddly cut off from the rest of the library.

The ride was short, but felt longer than it should.

At the top, the doors opened with a muted click. The light was dimmer here-heavy burgundy curtains covered the windows, letting only narrow strips of daylight through.

The shelves stood closer together, no computers in sight. Only books, as far as the eye could see. And that silence-dense, almost tangible.

“I like it up here,” Brandt said, her voice softening. “It’s quieter. When it’s slow, I sometimes sit in one of the chairs and read.”

She laughed briefly, but it sounded more like a confession.

Brandt stepped back into the elevator.

“Now I’ll show you the break room-if you want to call the old broom closet that—and then the archive. After that, you’ll have seen everything.”

Back downstairs, Brandt turned toward a door hidden behind one of the tall shelves. I hadn’t noticed it before-half concealed in shadow, as if deliberately overlooked.

With a practiced twist, she opened the heavy wooden door, which creaked softly but insistently.

A narrow stone stairwell was revealed. The walls rough, the floor worn. A spiral staircase wound both up and down. The air was cooler, drier-tinged with metal and dust.

Brandt raised a finger, pointing upward.

“That leads to the clock tower. We don’t need to go there. Technicians sometimes come to check the mechanism… luckily none of our concern.”

Just below the first step was a second narrow door. She opened it with a quiet click, and I stepped inside a tiny room.

“Our break room,” she said with a trace of irony.

The space was barely bigger than a storage closet. A small round table stood askew in the center, flanked by two wobbly chairs with threadbare cushions. On the table sat an old kettle stained with limescale, a jumble of yellowed tea boxes, loose sugar, and a glass holding stirrers. On an open shelf rested a mismatched collection of cups.

On the wall hung a faded poster with italicized lettering:

*“Reading is like traveling—only without luggage.”*

“Here you can take your lunch break,” Brandt said plainly.

I merely nodded and backed out. She closed the door, and we turned toward the stairs leading down.

The steps sounded dull, like soft stone worn by time itself.

At the foot of the stairs, the air grew noticeably cooler. It smelled of dust, cardboard, and the faintly sweet scent of aged paper.

Brandt stopped before a plain metal door and retrieved another key. The lock squeaked as she turned it, and the door opened with a heavy metallic groan.

“Welcome to the archive,” she said softly, more explanatory than inviting.

Inside it was dark.

A single light switch stood beside the doorframe. When she flicked it, two old bulbs flickered to life with a soft click-one directly above us, the other farther back. Their light was warm but weak, flickering as if struggling through layers of dust and age. The glow pushed feebly through the shadows; the shelves cast long, tangled silhouettes that seemed to breathe.

The room was larger than I had expected.

Rows of tall metal shelves lined the walls, forming a corridor between. They were packed with archive boxes, folders, old books in protective covers and bound volumes of journals.

In a corner stood an old wooden table with a stack of forms. Next to it, a clipboard with a pen tethered by string. An empty book cart leaned nearby.

“We keep everything here that’s rarely used or not needed at constant reach,” Brandt explained. Her voice echoed softly between the shelves.

“Old files, out-of-print works, reference books almost never borrowed… things like that. If you’re looking for something not found upstairs, it might be here.”

I nodded slowly.

The bulb above us hummed quietly, and somewhere a shelf creaked, as if the wood itself were breathing.

“If you need to shelve books or have leftover returns at day’s end, there’s plenty of room here.”

She looked at me.

“But don’t worry. You won’t need to come down here often-only when we rearrange or have a big return.”

We went back upstairs, and leaving the stairwell, I felt as though I’d just surfaced from deep water.

A subtle pressure I hadn’t realized weighed on me lifted suddenly-I drew in a breath as if I had forgotten to breathe down below.

Back at the counter, Brandt wordlessly returned to the stack of books she’d been working on. With practiced motion, she placed them on a metal cart already holding several volumes.

She nudged the cart slightly toward me; its wheels squeaked softly on the wood.

“So,” she said briskly. “Get to shelving these.”

She gestured to the upper and lower rows.

“The books upstairs belong downstairs, and those downstairs to the second floor. Take your time-it’s the best way to familiarize yourself with the layout.”

I nodded, resting a hand on the cart’s cool metal. It felt somehow solemn-like the moment I truly began working here.

Brandt returned to the counter, turned the monitor toward herself, and pulled the keyboard closer.

“If you need help-I’m here. I’ll check what organizational tasks we have.”

I set to work-and for the first time that day, I felt a calm, almost comforting focus.

Morning slipped away quickly.

I shelved books, learned the library better, and began to feel comfortable.

At noon, I ventured to a small shop opposite the library, grabbing a simple sandwich and hot coffee.

Though I’d tried the library’s coffee earlier, I preferred the real thing-the fresh brew that still smelled of roasted beans and warmth.

Shortly after midday, our part-timer Lena arrived.

Brandt introduced her: a pretty young woman, no older than twenty-three. She was a student, working afternoons to support her studies.

She reminded me of myself at that age-dark hair, brown eyes, and a smile that always seemed brightest.

The rest of the day, she helped me with various tasks, and together we managed the workload.

As the day wound down, the last visitors left, and the cleaners departed, Brandt showed me how to close properly.

“Always walk through the library once more to make sure everyone’s gone,” she said calmly.

Before leaving, she handed me a small bunch of keys.

“These are all the important keys you’ll need. Please take good care of them.”

I thanked her, promised to be careful, and we parted ways.

At home, I ate a light meal. After a hot, soothing shower, I slipped into bed with a pleasant feeling of satisfaction.

I liked my new job. I looked forward to the next day.

The first week passed faster than expected. Days filled with routine: shelving books, processing loans, answering questions. Each day, the library felt less foreign, the halls less strange-and I began to feel truly at home.

Yet there were small, almost imperceptible moments that made me pause. A whisper perhaps, heard only in my mind; a subtle shift in the atmosphere that defied explanation.

For instance, the ticking of the old grandfather clock on the top floor. A grand, stately clock whose steady click filled the upper room soothingly when quiet. Once, as I was shelving books and heading down, I passed the clock and glanced at it-only to notice it had stopped but was still making ticking sounds. I told myself the clock was likely still working but the mechanism moving the hands was broken. After all, it was very old. And I continued my day as usual.

Sometimes the air in one reading nook felt colder than it reasonably could be, despite the warm spring day outside. I pulled my jacket tighter and pushed the thoughts aside.

There were fleeting shadows too-out of the corner of my eye-swift movements vanishing whenever I turned. No person, no bird, no stray cat that might have slipped in.

One late evening, after emptying the return box, I heard a dull thud from inside-as if someone were inside knocking once. I opened it and peered in-nothing. I shut the lid firmly and convinced myself it was just in my imagination

I also noticed some books had shifted overnight-small shelves moved, titles misplaced. Brandt waved it off, saying the cleaners or visitors caused it. “It happens here,” she said casually.

I wanted to believe it, but the feeling of being watched lingered. Whenever I was alone in the library, I sensed a barely tangible gaze upon me. I turned, looking down empty aisles and silent shelves. No one was there.

These small oddities were like tiny cracks in the mirror of my new routine-barely visible, yet unmistakably present. I tried to ignore them and focus on work. After all, I was here to start fresh.

The incident that compelled me to write these lines occurred in the last two days.

Yesterday evening, Lena and I were the only ones in the library, closing up. She was upstairs switching off the lights when I suddenly heard that dull noise again from the return box.

Curious, I went to it and looked inside. There lay a book.

This confused me deeply. I had emptied the box less than ten minutes before.

Slowly, I pulled the book out and examined it. It was bound in black leather, old and heavy. But the strangest thing was the completely blank cover: no library sticker, no ISBN label, no title-nothing.

But that was not all.

The book felt unusually warm, as if it contained its own source of heat. I raised it to my face and sniffed. It smelled of old leather and paper, like all the other books here. But there was something else, a sharp metallic tang that made me shudder.

No other book I had touched this week smelled like that.

Uncertain, I didn’t know what to do. Then Lena came down the stairs. She smiled, but when she saw my puzzled face, her expression twisted into confusion.

“Is something wrong, Clara?” she asked gently.

“I… found this book in the return box,” I whispered.

“Okay? And what’s wrong with it? Is it damaged?” Lena stepped closer, eyes fixed on the book.

“No, but I don’t think it belongs here.” I handed it to her. She turned it over, searching for an ISBN as I had before. “Strange,” she muttered.

“What do we do with it?” I asked.

“I’d say we just put it in the archive,” Lena replied, handing it back.

Then she glanced at her watch and flinched.

“Is it okay if I leave now? I’m meeting some friends to study and I’m late.”

I nodded. "Sure. Have a good night" I said and tried to smile at her. "You too. See you tomorrow" she answered, grabbed her jacket and left.

Alone, I headed to the archive.

As I descended, the air grew heavier; shadows thickened. A suffocating silence wrapped around me, and I felt as if unseen eyes watched.

For the first time, an irresistible compulsion seized me-to open the book. I felt a peculiar tug, as though an unseen hand compelled me, urging my fingers to pry it open. A strange tingling crept over my skin, and the metallic scent wafted upward, sharp and biting like cold iron against my nostrils.

With trembling care, I parted the pages and began to read.

The narrative described a woman named Sarah, seated alone in an office before her computer. Each scene was rendered with unnerving precision-her emotions, her thoughts, even the smallest gestures of her hands were chronicled in painstaking detail.

Page after page unfolded mundane moments of Sarah’s existence-the way she held a cup of coffee, the conversations she engaged in-each fragment strangely vivid, as if the very essence of her life had been distilled onto the parchment.

A creeping confusion gnawed at me. Never before had I encountered a book so obsessively focused, so disquietingly intimate.

Who, I wondered, would desire to read such a thing?

Turning to the last described page, the scene ended with Sarah preparing a meal. Beyond this, the pages remained blank, though ample unmarked space stretched before me, mocking in its emptiness.

With every passing second, the sensation of unseen eyes watching me grew more intense, pressing upon my mind like a tangible weight. Hastily, I snapped the book shut.

From within its confines arose a cold breath of air, more metallic and acrid than before, curling upward as if exhaling from some abyssal source.

I placed the book upon the table, retrieved a scrap of paper, and inscribed a terse note: “Unknown book found in return box. - Clara.”

Diligently, I affixed the note to the cover, fetched one of the ancient archival boxes from the shelf, and slid the book inside.

Having returned the box to its place, I extinguished the light and left the archive with quickened steps.

As I moved through the silent corridors, the oppressive feeling of being observed weighed heavily upon me.

When I closed the heavy doors of the library behind me, a fleeting relief washed over me.

Yet the suffocating sensation lingered, trailing me all the way home and refusing to release its grip within the solitude of my apartment.

That night, sleep eluded me. Time and again, my thoughts returned obsessively to the book.

One aspect troubled me above all: though the volume was undeniably old-likely over fifty years-its contents portrayed a modern existence. Sarah worked at computers, watched television, lived as we do now.

How could this be?

I struggled to banish the thought and turned on the television. Eventually, exhaustion claimed me, and I slipped into uneasy slumber.

The next morning found me steadier, composed once more.

I prepared myself and set out for work.

The book had nearly faded from my memory.

I was the first to arrive at the library so I switched on the computers and lights, got me a coffee from the vending machine, and began to scan the books we had prepared the previous evening.

Halfway through the first stack, a sudden chill raced down my spine and I stopped dead in my tracks.

Amid the pile-where it was impossible anyone could have disturbed the order overnight-there lay the black book once more.

With trembling hands, I lifted it and opened the cover.

Something was different.

It felt older, heavier, as if it had gained weight in the night.

I turned to the final page-and my breath caught in my throat.

The last scene no longer showed Sarah preparing food.

Now she sat at a desk at work, staring out the window.

The book... had continued writing itself.
