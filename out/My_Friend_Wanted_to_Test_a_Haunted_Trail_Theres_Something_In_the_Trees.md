We weren’t supposed to be out there.

Not because it was illegal or fenced off or some “the government doesn’t want you here” thing. It was just… one of those places locals talk about like it’s weather.

You don’t hike that trail after 4. You don’t camp by the creek. If you hear someone calling your name, you keep walking like you didn’t.

Everyone has a version of why.

My friend had all of them saved in his head like tabs he never closed.

“Dude,” he said, adjusting the straps on his pack, “I’m telling you, it’s not even a hard trail. It’s basically a loop. We’re in and out.”

I stood under the wooden kiosk at the trailhead and stared at the map like it might change its mind and become comforting.

PINE HOLLOW LOOP — 3.8 MILES

ELEVATION GAIN: 640 FT

LAST WATER: SAGE CREEK (SEASONAL)

Below it was the warning board: weather, ticks, black bears, and a bright red sign that said CARRY OUT TRASH / NO FIRES / STAY ON TRAIL. Standard stuff.

Then, lower down, someone had carved into the wood with a key or a knife, the letters deep enough to catch the light.

DON’T LISTEN.

I stared at it a little too long.

My friend saw me and smiled like he’d won.

“See?” he said. “Haunted.”

“It’s graffiti,” I said.

“Graffiti with intent,” he replied, like that was a thing. “Also, my cousin’s friend—okay, yeah, I know—my cousin’s friend swears he heard a lady crying out here last summer. Like, full-on sobbing. And when he went to check—”

“You don’t go check,” I cut in automatically.

He spread his hands. “Exactly. That’s what makes it creepy. That’s the point.”

He said it like we were buying tickets to a haunted house.

The thing about my friend is he wasn’t dumb. He got A’s without trying. He was good at sports. He had common sense—most of the time.

But he had this itch. Like he needed to prove scary stories were fake by walking straight into them.

“You told your mom you were at my house?” I asked.

He rolled his eyes. “Yes. And I told my dad we’re ‘getting fresh air.’ Relax.”

“Fresh air,” I repeated, dry.

“Fresh air with lore,” he said, grinning, and started down the trail before I could argue again.

I followed, and the gravel lot disappeared behind the trees.

At first it was normal. Pine needles underfoot. Sun through branches. A couple squirrels doing their usual “I’m going to throw an acorn at you” routine. The trail was well-worn, wide enough for two people if you didn’t mind brushing shoulders.

We talked like we always talked when we were trying to make time pass.

School. A teacher we both hated. How his older brother was probably going to flunk out of community college because he spent more time benching than studying.

He kept tapping the side pocket of his pack like he was checking something. Eventually I realized it was his phone.

“No service,” I said, because I could see him trying to pretend he didn’t care.

He made a face. “My dad’s going to say this is ‘nature healing my screen addiction.’”

“Your dad texts you eight times a day,” I said.

“That’s love,” he said, and then, like a magnet, the conversation swung back to the place.

“You ever notice,” he said, “how every town has a ‘don’t go in the woods’ spot?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Because people get lost in woods.”

“No, like… a specific spot,” he insisted. “Like there’s always a bridge or a creek or a trail that everyone agrees is weird.”

“Maybe because people like making stuff up,” I said.

He walked backwards for a couple steps, hands spread like he was presenting a case. “Okay, but answer this: why do people always hear voices? Like, the same thing. Crying. Someone yelling your name. A baby. It’s always the same.”

“Because brains are stupid,” I said. “We hear patterns. It’s like how you see faces in clouds.”

He snapped his fingers. “Exactly. Faces.”

“What?”

He nodded toward the trees. “That’s what people say they see out here. Faces. Like, in the bark. In the leaves. Like someone is standing behind a tree, but when you focus it’s just… wood.”

A chill ran up my spine that had nothing to do with temperature.

“Cool,” I said, because I didn’t have a better word.

He laughed. “Dude, you’re fine. You’re literally armed.”

I looked down at what he meant—my little folding knife clipped to my pocket. It was a cheap one my uncle gave me with a gas station logo on it. Great for opening boxes. Not much else.

“Yeah,” I said. “Terrifying.”

We kept walking.

About a mile in, we passed a small wooden post with a metal tag nailed to it: PHL-1.0. My friend slapped it like it was a checkpoint.

“One mile,” he said. “See? Easy.”

I nodded, but my attention had snagged on something else.

A smell.

Not rot, not skunk, not bear.

Something like wet pennies and old leaves. Like metal left out in rain.

It came and went, faint, like the woods were breathing it.

After maybe twenty minutes, the trail narrowed. The woods got thicker. The air changed. It wasn’t colder, exactly, but it felt heavier, like the wind didn’t move here the same way. The sound of our footsteps got softer, muffled by moss and damp earth.

That’s when I had the first “I’m being watched” moment.

It wasn’t dramatic. No twig snap. No shadow darting.

Just a feeling, like someone had leaned closer behind you in a line and you could sense the space changing.

I glanced back.

Nothing.

Just the path curving away, empty and green.

“You good?” my friend asked without looking back, like he could tell I’d slowed.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Thought I saw—never mind.”

He smirked. “Face in the trees?”

“Shut up.”

He chuckled, pleased with himself, and we kept going.

Another ten minutes and I saw it again.

Not a full person. Not a clear shape.

A face.

Or what my brain insisted was a face.

Pale and flat between two trunks off to the left, half-hidden by fern fronds. Just enough contrast to look wrong. Like skin where there shouldn’t be skin.

I stopped walking without meaning to.

My friend took a few steps before noticing, then turned. “What?”

I stared.

The “face” didn’t move. It didn’t blink. It just… was.

My throat tightened. “Do you see that?”

He squinted in the direction I was looking. “See what?”

“Right there,” I said, pointing.

He leaned slightly, then shrugged. “Bro. That’s a light patch of bark.”

“That’s not bark,” I said, and I hated how small my voice sounded.

He walked closer to the spot like he was approaching a museum exhibit. “It’s literally bark.”

As he got within ten feet, the “face” disappeared—not like it ran, but like it stopped being a face the moment the angle changed. It became just trees and shadow.

He turned back to me with the same grin. “Faces in clouds, remember?”

My heart was still pounding. “Okay. Yeah. Sure.”

He didn’t let it go. “You’re spooking yourself.”

“Whatever,” I said, and forced my feet to move again.

We reached a clearing maybe five minutes later.

It wasn’t a big open field or anything. Just a spot where the trees pulled back and the sun had space to hit the ground. There were rocks and a fallen log and a patch of grass that looked weirdly untouched, like no deer had ever stepped there.

A second trail marker stood at the edge of it, half-tilted: PHL-1.8.

My friend dropped his pack with a dramatic sigh. “Break time.”

I hesitated, scanning the tree line.

Nothing.

Normal woods.

I told myself to stop being weird and sat on the fallen log.

He pulled out a dented stainless steel water bottle with a bunch of stickers on it—one of those Hydro Flask knockoffs—and drank like he’d been dying. I had a cheap crinkly plastic bottle from a gas station, the label half peeled off because I’d been fidgeting with it.

We drank water, passed a granola bar back and forth like we were splitting contraband, and for a minute I felt stupid for being on edge. The clearing was warm. The sun made little bright spots on my friend’s hair. It felt like a normal Saturday again.

“Okay,” my friend said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “So the legend—”

I groaned. “Here we go.”

He ignored me. “The legend is that this used to be a settlement trail. Like a hundred years ago. People would cut through here to get to the old mill.”

“You mean the mill that’s gone?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said, undeterred. “And there was this family—again, I know this sounds like campfire—who got lost in a storm and froze out here. The mom was screaming for help, and the dad went looking, and—”

He stopped mid-sentence.

His face changed.

Not scared yet. Just confused.

“What?” I asked.

He held up a hand like he was listening.

I listened too.

At first I thought it was my ears adjusting.

Then I realized it wasn’t that.

Everything had gone silent.

No birds.

No bugs.

No wind.

Not even that faint “leaf shimmer” sound you don’t notice until it’s gone.

It felt like someone had pressed mute on the world.

My skin prickled.

“What the—” my friend started.

A sound came from the woods.

Not close. Not far.

A scream.

And it wasn’t a movie scream. It was ugly. It sounded like someone being hurt badly, like pain dragged out into the air.

It ended with a wet choking noise.

My friend stood up fast. “That’s—”

“Don’t,” I said, grabbing his sleeve.

He shook me off. “That’s a person.”

Another scream.

This one higher. Shorter. Like someone couldn’t keep it going.

My friend took two steps toward the tree line. “Hello?”

My stomach dropped. “Stop. Stop yelling.”

He turned toward me, eyes wide now. “What if someone’s getting attacked?”

And then the scream came again—right on the edge of the clearing.

Close.

Too close.

It sounded like it was coming from behind a tree ten feet away.

My friend spun toward it, and I saw his shoulders go rigid.

Because something in the trees moved.

Not like a deer. Not like a bear.

It moved like a person trying to move like an animal.

Low, quick, wrong.

My friend stepped back. “What—”

The thing hit him.

It came out of the shadows like it had been waiting for that exact moment, like it knew he’d turn and his body would open up.

There was a blur of motion, a heavy impact, and my friend went down hard, the sound of his back hitting the ground knocking the breath out of me.

I stood up so fast my water bottle fell and rolled.

I saw it then, not clearly, but enough.

Tall limbs.

A torso that looked too narrow.

A head that wasn’t right, like the face was stretched or covered, like skin pulled too tight over something that didn’t match.

And eyes.

Flat eyes that didn’t blink.

My friend tried to scramble backward, hands digging into dirt.

The creature didn’t rush. It hovered over him for a half-second, almost… considering.

Then it opened its mouth.

And the scream that came out wasn’t a scream from a woman.

It was my friend’s voice.

It sounded exactly like him, down to the little crack his voice gets when he’s yelling too loud.

“Help me!”

My blood turned to ice.

Because the sound wasn’t coming from my friend’s mouth.

It was coming from the thing.

My friend’s eyes went wide with realization, and he made a sound like a sob, like his body understood he was already too late.

I grabbed my friend’s arm and pulled.

“Get up,” I hissed. “Get up!”

He tried. He got one foot under him.

The creature moved, fast and precise.

It grabbed him.

Not like an animal grabbing prey, but like a person grabbing a wrist in an argument.

It yanked him back so hard his head snapped and his teeth clacked. He screamed for real this time, a high raw sound, and his nails tore through dirt as he tried to hold on.

I lunged forward without thinking and swung my pocket knife.

I didn’t even aim well. I just stabbed at whatever I could reach.

I hit something.

The blade sank in with a wet resistance and then slid out.

The creature turned its head toward me.

Not angry.

Curious.

Like it hadn’t expected me to do that.

And then it moved.

It didn’t swipe at my knife hand.

It went for me.

It hit my chest like a tackle, hard enough to knock me backward. I felt the air blast out of me. My shoulder slammed into the log.

Pain exploded down my side.

Before I could get up, something sharp dragged across my arm—three lines of fire ripping from elbow to wrist.

I yelled, and the sound came out thin because I couldn’t breathe right.

The creature was on me for half a second and then off again, already back to my friend.

Like I wasn’t the meal. Just the obstacle.

My friend was screaming, flailing, trying to kick it away.

And the creature… it did something I still can’t replay without shaking.

It leaned close to him, face inches from his, and it whispered in his voice.

A normal voice. Casual. Almost annoyed.

“Stop.”

My friend froze for a split second because his brain tried to obey his own voice.

That hesitation was all it needed.

It jerked him sideways into the tree line with a strength that didn’t match its thin body.

He grabbed at a sapling and snapped it.

He grabbed at a rock and missed.

Then he was gone into the trees like someone dragged him under water.

The woods swallowed him.

The clearing was empty except for me, panting, blood running down my arm, and the rolled water bottle glinting in the sun like it didn’t understand anything had changed.

I listened.

No footsteps.

No struggle.

Then, from deeper in the trees, I heard it again.

My friend’s voice.

Not screaming now.

Calling my name.

Soft. Friendly.

Like he was standing just behind a trunk, waving me over like everything was fine.

My stomach heaved.

I backed up, shaking my head, whispering to myself, “No. No.”

The voice tried again, sweeter. “Come here. I’m okay.”

I clamped my injured arm to my chest and ran.

I didn’t care about the trail. I didn’t care about staying calm. I only cared about getting out of that clearing and not letting my eyes get caught by the wrong shadow.

The woods stayed silent as I ran, like the whole place was holding its breath.

Every so often, I’d hear my friend’s voice again—farther now, like it was pacing me from the trees. Sometimes it sounded like him laughing. Sometimes it sounded like he was crying.

Once, it sounded like my mom.

That almost made me stop. Almost.

I forced my legs to keep moving until my lungs burned and my vision started to tunnel.

I burst back onto the main trail and kept running until I saw the trailhead kiosk through the trees.

When I stumbled into the gravel lot, there were people there. A couple with a dog. An older guy loading a bike onto a rack. Normal life.

I tried to talk and couldn’t at first. My mouth kept opening and nothing came out.

Then words spilled, ugly and broken, and someone called 911.

An EMT wrapped my arm and asked me questions I couldn’t answer.

Where exactly did it happen? Which direction? How tall was it? What did it look like?

I kept saying, “I don’t know,” because I didn’t. I couldn’t hold the shape of it in my mind. Every time I tried, it turned into trees again.

The sheriff showed up and asked my friend’s name.

I gave just his first name. My voice shook so badly it didn’t sound like mine.

They asked if he had a phone. If he had a whistle. If he knew the trails.

I kept staring at the tree line, waiting to see a pale face between trunks.

I didn’t see anything.

But when the search team started organizing—when radios crackled and flashlights got checked and people started moving with purpose—my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I almost ignored it.

My screen lit up.

Unknown number.

No contact name.

Just one text.

WHY DID YOU LEAVE HIM?

And beneath it, an audio message attachment.

I didn’t open it.

I didn’t have to.

Because before I could even think, my phone speaker crackled—just a half-second of sound, like it played by itself.

My friend’s voice, close and clear, whispering like he was leaning toward my ear.

“Come back.”

I threw my phone into the grass so hard it bounced.

Everyone stared at me like I’d lost it.

Maybe I had.

Because when I looked back at the woods, I swear—just for a second—I saw a face in the trees.

And it smiled.
