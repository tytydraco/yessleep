It's hard enough to lose your job, try moving into my cousin, Chris' basement. He promised he would clear out the old stuff my aunt and uncle had be collecting for what seemed like centuries. He hadn't but considering all and all, I wasn't going to complain.

I arrived around 5pm and in the middle of December, so it may have well been midnight with how dark it was outside. At least the basement was warm. Chris showed me the door to downstairs and handed me the key to door that led outside. "You can use the upstairs door for most things, but I'm required by the Fire Marshall to give you this in case of a fire. Also, for fire safety, use the room with a window for your bedroom and the other for storage."

I nodded, half in a daze. It had been a 4 hour drive and I was ready to make any four walls a bedroom and any flat surface a bed. I took the key and dragged my measly duffel bag down the stairs with me. It was a standard basement, large room at the end of the stairs with two doors on the back wall leading to bedrooms. The door on the side led up a set of stairs to the outside.

I'm sure the decor was chic in the 70s, but now the burnt orange carpet, wood and brick felt ominous, especially with the dim incandescent lights. I settled onto the cream couch with brown print pastoral scenes and a plastic covering to protect it. The plastic crinkled under my weight. My eyelids met for but a second. The sound of gun fire in rapid succession, like a machine gun, jolted me awake. I thought my cousin lived in a fairly safe neighborhood. I ran upstairs.

My cousin sat calmly at the kitchen table working on a puzzle. He looked at me equally puzzled. "You ok?" He asked.

I fidgeted."Yeah, did you hear that?"

"Hear what?"

"It sounded like a gun going off-"

"Haven't heard anything. You wanna check the ring camera?" He stretched out his phone for me to take.

I shook my head. "No, that's ok. I might have dreamed it."

I could tell from the way he was looking at me, he assumed my losing my job was from a mental break.

"Alright then." And he went back to his puzzle and I back down stairs.

In order to make room for my bed, I moved around his parent's old stuff. To prevent myself from dozing I softly sang to myself the comfort song of my childhood. *"I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream"* my voice filled the empty space with a slight echo.

I found an old photograph peeping out of one box. It was of a tall handsome man with long flowing hair, one I didn't recognize. His appearance neither fit the 1970s nor any particular time period. He felt so out of place but I couldn't put my finger on why. He didn't quite feel, human, to me for reasons I could not articulate.

Suddenly a soft voice resonated from one of the backrooms. It's familiarity pulled me in. As I grew closer to the voice emanating from the closet, I recognized the song.

*"I know you, I've walked with you once upon a dream. I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so a familiar a gleam."* It was a deep baritone voice.

As my hand neared the door I suddenly heard a crash upstairs. I left and ran up to my cousin's side. He was on the floor jerking suddenly, caught in a seizure. I grabbed his nasal spray from the counter and gave him a dose. He slowly came to.

"Laura?"

"Yeah, I'm right here." I gently held his head in my lap.

He smiled and closed his eyes. "I probably should head to bed for the night."

"Do you need help up the stairs?" I gently pulled his wheelchair over and helped him back into it.

"No, I can transfer into the lift just fine. Thank you. And thank you for being willing to live with me. I know it's... a lot."

"No, thank you for letting me bum a room off you. You are doing me the favor remember?"

He smiled at this and headed to bed.

I crouched down to pick up puzzle pieces Chris had spilled to the floor. Under the table I spotted something grey-blue and reached out. It was perhaps the softest feather I've ever touched and very long. Too long for the blue jays outback and it was way too cold in these parts for any tropical birds. I mused wondering if it had been part of an art project Chris was working on. I tucked it into my braided hair.

I finished cleaning and headed back downstairs to sleep. Too tired to inflate the air mattress I decided the ugly couch would have to do. I slumped into it and covered myself with the plastic covering, like a makeshift blanket.

"Try not to suffocate to death." I filled the empty with my own voice but also wondered if it wouldn't be bad if I did. After all, I had lost my purpose when I lost my job.

Sleep came quickly and I found my dreams tainted with fears from being homeless and unemployed. My nightmare was interrupted as I heard crunching of plastic and a weight on my chest. I slowly forced my eyes to open and coordinate. Through the distortion of plastic I could see two, glimmering yellow eyes staring back at me.

They watched me with unwavering stillness. I tried to scream or even breathe, but the crushing weight of the entity on my chest prevented both. I heard again a soft singing.

*"I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream."* It used a large bill to pull down the plastic and it stared me straight in the face.

Suddenly I realized where the blue feather from was from. A giant blue bird with a prehistoric appearance stared me down. I wracked my brain to remember, a few weeks ago with Chris. We had visited a dinosaur museum together and I vaguely remember seeing this creature on display there.

"Shoe billed stork?" I wheezed softly.

The animal slowly blinked in the most unnerving way. It nodded and clapped it's beak together producing a very distinct, almost machine gun sound.

*"I know you"* it whispered.

"What? What do you mean-"

"Ssssister." It nuzzled it's beak against me. As it did, I realized it was chewing on my hair. With all the strength I could muster, I quickly rolled it off of me, falling to the ground with it.

The bird let out a horrific shriek of rejection and surprise. It clapped it's beak at me, my bones shuddering at the sound. Not wasting time I rushed for the stairs. It saw my escape and threw its entire weight at them, collapsing them. The remaining steps to the landing hung suspended above my head, too far for me to jump.

"Nooooo!" It hissed. "Need new sample."

I slowly backed up until my back slammed against the door. The bird stood still watching me. It slowly lurched forward with every step. My mind racing, I reached into my pocket gently greeted by the cold metal of the key Chris had given me earlier. As I pulled it out, the stork dove at me, using one foot to pin my torso to the wall.

Pain radiated through my shoulder followed by wetness. I realized it had driven its beak into my trapezius muscle. I could hear the bird cackling as it clacked it bill, consuming my flesh. While it was distracted I shoved the key into the lock and turned the knob. The door flew open and cold rushed in. The creature screeched with displeasure and ran into the bedroom. I slammed the door behind myself and got into my car. I drove for miles, the pain in my shoulder keeping me awake.

It was only after the adrenaline wore down that I realized, I left Chris alone. I found a gas station and pulled in. I dialed his landline. He groggily answered, "hello?"

"Chris! You need to-" The dial tone hummed loudly in my ear. "No, no, no" I dialed again.

This time, a familiar voice answered. "Chris is tired. Can you please call back during the day?"

"What?" I asked dumbfounded.

"Sorry, we aren't interested in what you are selling" I heard my voice speaking back to me.

"Let him go." Tears welled up in my eyes, my voice faltering.

The voice paused and spoke softly. "Chris is perfectly safe. He asked me to move in to take care of him. And it can stay that way. As long as you never come back, do you understand?"

I sobbed in terror.

"Do you understand?"

"Yes." I replied.

"Good. Farewell. Sister."

I drove away and never saw my cousin again. I ended up moving in with my father and found a new job. A few years later I got a Christmas Card, my cousin and me, smiling happily in matching dinosaur sweaters. Only, something about my face didn't look quite human enough.
