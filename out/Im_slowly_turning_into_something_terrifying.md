 

I know that there is something wrong with me. Something that has never happened to anybody else.  

About 2 weeks ago I started to feel extremely ill, I puked all the time, I coughed blood, and I couldn’t even stand up without passing out. I went to multiple Doctors, but they didn’t know what was happening to me. I got my blood work done and everything on the tests was perfect. They checked every single inch of my body, and they still couldn’t tell what was going on. 

Everything changed last week when I noticed something terrifying. I woke up around 2:00 a.m. last night, I couldn’t ack to sleep because I was coughing relentlessly. just to start my daytart my day. I went downstairs into my kitchen and got something to eat. I took a bite out of my food and when I swallowed, I felt the most excruciating pain imaginable. I didn’t know what was happening and I figured that the pain would probably disappear by the end of the day. 

I went back upstairs and got into the shower. I turned on the water and I noticed a huge bubble or bump or something like that on my right hip, but the weirdest thing about it was that it was a color I have never seen before. I can't even describe it. 

For some reason, I decided to touch it and it slowly started disappearing. I was relieved and extremely scared; I spent the rest of the day thinking about whatever was on me, and if I should’ve gone to the hospital and gotten it checked out. 

An hour after that incident I started feeling extremely weird, n’t really tell you what I was feeling but I passed out not too long after that. 

The next day there were more of them, they were also different colors. Every day after that there were more and more bubbles, but today something different appeared.   

Today when I woke up in the middle of the night again, I checked if there was anything new on me and I found something extremely disturbing. My whole body was covered with eyes. They were all bloodshot and had horrible images on their pupils. The images aren’t something I could describe the only way you would know what I was talking about was if you saw it for yourself.  

Last night I went to the doctor, and I took off my shirt and showed him what had happened to me, he looked scared, but like he knew what he had to do. He started to walk away, and he told me calmly. 

“*I’ll be back in a second”* 

I waited in his office for 20 minutes and he didn’t come. I decided to open the door to see what was happening. I walked up to the door and slowly started to open it. I saw a group of men in black suits evacuating the entire floor. 

When they got everyone out of the building all of them took out what looked to be guns and started heading towards me. I started panicking. I thought I was going to die.  

When they walked up to the door they yelled. 

“*IS ANYBODY IN HERE”* 

For some reason, I answered 

“*YES, PLEASE DON’T SHOOT ME”* 

They kicked the door in and one of them shot me and I slowly started to fade away. 

I woke up in a room that was fully white and all I could see was 7 men in black suits. Then they started to ask me questions 

“*Who are you,”* they asked. 

I was so shocked that I couldn’t even reply. 

“*When did you encounter it”* 

I didn’t know what they were talking about, so I said. 

“*I have no idea. What's going on? Please help me”* 

They said that if I was of no use to them, they were going to have to kill me instantly. That’s when whatever was in me made all of them drop to the floor. It also freed me and opened the door of the room we were in. I started to walk out of the room and a full army of agents or whoever they were started shooting at me. A lot of the shots hit me, but I couldn’t feel a thing.  

I walked out of there completely fine and then I started to feel ill again. I passed out and woke up in my room. 

I have decided to share my story with you because I want to warn you about me. I don’t know what this creature will do once it fully takes control.
