LONG POST

This story takes place in November of 2022.  At the time I drew a special elk tag in the Beaverhead mountain range of central/east Idaho. I had hunted in this area many times before over the years, and I know the area like the back of my hand. It became a place of comfort and good memories. It still is, but I haven’t looked at it the same since the story I am about to tell. 

I planned a week long trip for the first week of November, and took one of my best friends with me. We spent the first four days hiking up and down various ridges, chasing elk and having a blast. The nights were spent story telling and eating soup by the stove, mind you it was November in Idaho, so it was very cold. 

It was the fourth night of the trip. It had snowed during the day, and a fresh layer of snow lay on the ground. The sky had since cleared up, and a very cold but still and quiet air had settled in. My friend and I had gotten into a deep discussion about the Bible, spirits, cryptids, skinwalkers etc. ( I should note that my friend had at the time been experiencing a decline in his mental health, and it was not uncommon for him to sometimes behave erratically. This will be relevant later in the story )

During this conversation I felt an intense fear kinda settle on me. It almost felt like the air had become tense. I had the urge to change the discussion into something else, but that’s when it happened. Within 20 or 30 yards of the tent, what I thought at first was a coyote began yipping and barking very very loudly. I looked at my friend, who became excited and told me to grab my gun so we could go look for this thing. 

It was strange though, and something didn’t feel right. The animal, whatever it was, didn’t exactly sound like a coyote. It almost shrieked as opposed to yipping the way coyotes do, and it would occasionally bark, and at times almost scream. I’m also an experienced outdoorsman, and any other hunter knows a coyote would not approach a tent in the middle of nowhere and draw attention to itself. 

It would continue to vocalize for about 3-5 minutes at a time, circling the tent from a distance. I reluctantly grabbed my rifle and my spotlight (very bright intense flashlight) and started looking for this thing. As I stepped about 10 yards away from the tent, I heard it again directly in front of me, shrieking, barking, etc. I shined my light directly at it. I could see probably 150-200 yards in front of me. Yet nothing was there. No eyes shining in the light, no outline of an animal or person, nothing. 

After repeating this same scenario 3 or 4 times, we gave up and went back in the tent to warm up. But the sound wouldn’t stop. At one point when it went silent, my friend poked his head out of the tent and yelled “HEY! SHUTUP!”. He was immediately answered with a scream from the animal. At times it sounded like it came from above the tent in the tree we were camped under. 

I tried playing it off as a coyote or maybe a hunting dog that got lost, but I could not convince myself it was either of those, simply based on the bizarre sounds it made and the strange timing of it all. We ignored it for the rest of the time. It slowly started going further and further away from the tent until it finally stopped about an hour or so later while we pretended it wasn’t there. 

The next morning I looked around the area for tracks, yet to my surprise I found nothing but our own. We didn’t talk about it for the rest of the trip, and a few days later we went home. 

Now I don’t know if it is at all related, but about 3 months after this, my friend had a complete mental breakdown. And has since never been on a hunting trip. Some in his family (a deeply religious family) questioned whether he was victim of some spiritual attack or something of that nature. 

I didn’t correlate the two at the time, but in hindsight I have so many questions about that night. Is it a coincidence whatever that animal was appeared during that particular conversation? Could it have actually been a coyote or wolf? Why couldn’t I see any eyes gleaming with the flashlight? Did this incident have something to do with my friends mental decline? My friend would sometimes tell me and others about strange things he saw or heard, was this related?

If anyone has anything to point out please share.
