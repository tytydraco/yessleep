Think of me what you will but I know that what I do truly matters. I know that if I don’t watch over her, she’ll get hurt. Some small minded fool would come and take her from me. No one, is gonna take her from me.

I'm sure you’re curious on why I’m here, well I’ll tell you, soon I’ll be loved and she’ll need someone new to save her. Writing this here is just one of the many ways I’m using to try and find suitable replacements. You’ll have to be approved of course but don’t worry I’m sure she’ll love you. Her love is for everyone, eventually.

Like I said I’m no stalker, I watch her not out of some sick perverted want but instead out of necessity. She’s special and when someone’s that special often they’re targeted. Targeted by insignificant nobodies that’d do anything to feel a fraction of how she does.

My duty as her protector is simple, stop any darkness that dare threatens to encroach on her effervescent light, or I guess I should say that’ll be your duty. At first you might be confused, you might even be a little scared but fear is simply ignorance. View her as plain and you’re blind but don’t worry her love will let you see. For it’s only when you look past the ordinary you’ll see the truth to her beauty.

For her light shines the brightest, her scent smells the sweetest and her roots grow the deepest.

You’re not the first I’ve told of her majesty but hopefully you’ll be the first to listen, to believe. It’s for your best interest we’re not talking in person because if you were not to believe me, she’d hear it. The perfect can get upset too.

No one ever believes me.

Think about it, if you were the most stunning creature in the universe and no one believed in you, wouldn’t you become coarse. All she wants to do is love and be loved by others but they refuse her. Her anger grows untamable with each rejection.

I don’t like killing.

I could go on and on about how magnificent she is but they would just ignore me. Instead they choose to ask irrelevant questions, such as if I’m hungry or what’s my name but the truth is I’m not sure anymore.

Every day I spend watching her I find it harder and harder to remember the one before. I can’t remember my mothers face anymore but then again I’m not so sure I ever had one. All I know for certain is that she’s beautiful and god is she beautiful.

I truly hope you get to see her one day. There are no physical or mental requirements needed to be chosen. There is no limit to the amount of protectors she desires. When someone as grand as her decides to allow a nobody like you to serve her, well it truly is the highest honor. All she asks from us is to love her unconditionally and if you’re lucky in the end she’ll love you too.

If I did my job, you should now be longing for her. If you're ready to love her and want her location it’s simple, carve a heart in a tree and then carve your name into the heart. After that the rest will become clear.

You’ll go to her. 

You’ll love her. 

Then, she’ll finally love me.
