   I was bored today. I had a day off, and none of my friends were off too. After some time, I ended up on my computer, where a generic picture of an abandoned prison was displayed as my background. The prison reminded me of an old psychiatric facility near my house. The place was supposedly a hospital for mental health treatment, but everyone around here just called it a prison for the mentally ill. Considering the condition of the building, and the mystery behind it, I wondered if anyone had made a video or article regarding the place. I figured that there must be at least one, considering the building was abandoned close to 14 years ago. After a bit of tweaking my search, I eventually found a video from YouTube called "I found a ghost in an abandoned hospital!" Although skeptical, I clicked on the video. \~\~Maybe it wasn't just clickbait.\~\~ Although I knew it had to be clickbait, I had to see if the video was about the facility.

   Early on in the video was a quick view of the outside of the hospital. I immediately recognized it as the building that I was looking for. I continued watching. The video was fairly basic and predictable, following the same patterns as every other generic haunted building video on YouTube. At least, that's what I though. About ten minutes into the video, the YouTuber was walking down a long hallway towards what looks like another hallway intersecting the one he was in. Once he reached it, it turned out it ended very quickly on one side. Looking around in the dead end, the YouTuber finds a sign over a \*door\*. The sign read "For Emergencies Only." The YouTuber notices the sign, but ignores it and leaves. The rest of the video went on like he never saw the dead end.

   After the video was over, I decided to rewind back to the part with the \*door\*. I knew something was off about this part, but I couldn't tell what. Then it hit me. The YouTuber zooms in on the sign over the \*door\* and talks about it, but never once mentions the \*door\* itself, or even looks directly at it. Confused, I've decided to look around for more videos or articles later.

   Please, if you have any information regarding the Intrigna Hospital, comment and let me know. I'll probably be able to respond within 3 hours.

   Update: I checked on the video the next day and it was gone. The YouTuber deleted it. That only confuses me further. The video wasnâ€™t new, it had been on YouTube for several years. So why did he delete it now? Oh, and I found a small fandom containing information regarding the company that built the hospital (not Intrigna). If you want to see it for yourself, I'll see if I can add a link in the comments. The company's name is >!Versal Corporation!<. Only look if you want to learn more.
