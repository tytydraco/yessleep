I don't know what to believe anymore. I don't even know how I should start this. Every rational thought I have in my head tells me he's gone, he's dead, I literally saw it with my own eyes, but these past two weeks have me questioning literally everything. I wasn't exactly stable going into this, so maybe this is all my introduction to insanity. But, albeit embarrassingly, a large part of me really does think this could be a sign that he's not totally gone.

Before I go back to two weeks ago, let's go back years. I met Luka in middle school. He was a lonely, awkward child with no friends. He was totally mute, which furthered this isolation. At first, I also didn't want to be friends with him. He was a little clingy, just desperate to be included really, and would hang around with his little notebook hoping someone would read the things he wanted to say. I told my mom about the new odd boy in class, and she immediately pushed me to talk to him. She even taught me some sign language (her sister was deaf). I'm grateful she did, because it was the start of a lifelong friendship. 

None of my other friends liked him, but he would always assure me that didn't matter, because I always stuck around. I couldn't help but feel a slight guilt about being more popular than him, though, especially when he very clearly suppressed tears as I told him I was leaving Arkansas. I wanted to go to college in California. This proved to be one of the worst decisions I'd ever made. Leaving my entire support system just left me horribly depressed, and I ended up dropping out and couch surfing in LA for the next two years. I wasn't living, I was merely existing. 

So when Luka flew out to surprise me with a visit, it was healing. The places I felt like I just drifted in and out of now held a sense of purpose, as I was excited to show him everything. It was one of the greatest months of my life, and well needed refresh from the hole I'd sunk myself into. 

I wouldn't see him until the following October, when I went back to Arkansas for my aunt's wedding. It was her third, so she didn't take it very seriously and made it a costume party since Halloween was just around the corner. It was a fun, casual affair, and a way for me to link back up with all my old small town friends, not just Luka. This is how we ended back at his sister's house to keep drinking and keep the party going.

It seemed all those years of people in this town treating him like he'd never amount to anything because of his disability weighed on him, because he never made any attempts to leave this place. He still lived with his sister, who'd been raising him for years at this point after his parents kicked him out. It was surreal being back in his room as an adult. Not much had changed. Fangoria posters still covered the walls alongside his prized collection of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac comics. There was the same CD tower I'd accidentally fallen into and broke as a kid, still held together with duct tape and a dream. We should have stayed in that room and soaked in the nostalgia, but fate had other plans.

Luka lived on a large property, and another member of our group, Rosette, figured it would be fun to tromp about the bush and take pictures seems we were together for the first time in years and all wearing costumes. The idea sounded fun to Luka and I as well, and though Will, the last member of our little group, wanted to just sit and keep drinking, he humored us. Growing up, Luka's sister told us all sorts of stories about how haunted this property was, which added to our Halloween themed fun.

The night air was alive with the sounds of bugs chirping and wind trickling the leaves. In the moments when the wind slowed, you could catch the echoes of the stream a few miles out, which Will called whispers to try and scare me. It was calm and serene, and the light of the half moon overhead really added to the ambiance. The property itself was a little rough, as it wasn't very well managed. There was no clear path and everything that grew here had long overgrown it's space. There were random drop offs below under your feet and spiders dangling from trees over your head. City life had admittedly spoiled me, and I found myself struggling to keep up with everyone else. 

“Come on, Hollywood, can't handle a little trees and dirt? Or are you just scared?” Rosette was having a joy teasing me. She was always the rough and tumble type, and the princess costume she wore was now covered in dirt, sticks, and spiderwebs. 

“I'm managing!,” I shouted back, though my voice lacked confidence. They were all about ten feet ahead, and in the dark I was afraid of losing them. 

Will snickered and tossed a few rocks back at me, before running ahead of Rosette. Apparently it was a race, because she also took off and my heart sank. 

“Guys!” My voice cracked as I yelled after them, adding to how pathetic I seemed. Maybe California had softened me. 

The only one who took pity was Luka. He looked ahead, then back at me, then ahead one more time before slowing his step. A sympathetic smile was on his face, the hint of sadness it held amplified by the Pierrot makeup he wore and the limited light of my phone flashlight. 

“You been ok?” Now that it was just the two of us, I wanted to really catch up. I'd only been in town a few days, but I made very little time for Luka despite him being my best friend. I also had a slew of unanswered texts from him, and it seemed for awhile like we were really drifting. Seeing him now made me feel guilty about it all. Luka was always troubled, and that sadness in his features told me that didn't really go away. 

‘I'm great’, he signed back. ‘This is actually the first time I've been out with friends in forever.’

“Oh.” Did no one hang out with him anymore since I left? Or was I just the only person who ever had pulled him out of his room? “Well hey, I'll be here a whole month. There's lots we can do.”

His smile grew, only faltering as I slipped. Some loose dirt gave way underfoot, almost making take a spill down one of the many drop offs on the property. I was obviously shaken, and only once I was sure I was safe did I let out some laughter. 

‘You ok?,’ Luka signed, and I assured him I was. With a sigh, his smile returned and he took a step back to give me some space. Big mistake.

The ground beneath his foot immediately crumbled away, and he suddenly was swallowed by the darkness. Among my own shouting I heard animals taking off, branches snapping, and the panicked running footsteps of Rosette and Will. I was already trying to scramble down the steep hill of crumbling roots and dirt, panicking as I couldn’t see anything. I also couldn't hear Luka. No groans of pain, no breathing, nothing. 

The three of us made it to the flat ground below, a little worse for wear but able enough to begin the frantic search for our friend. Our cellphones were the only light and it was very limited, which just added to the dread. Maybe stupidly, we called out for Luka, despite the fact he couldn't call back. 

“Rosie! Benny!” It was Will. 

He was already calling 911, and Rosette was trying to calmly assess everything. I was a mess. Luka was a mess of dirt, branches, and blood, and the only sounds he made was an occasional labored breath. Rosette told me not to touch him, but I couldn't help it. I dropped to my knees and gingerly held him close, clutching his face to my chest. 

“You're gonna be ok,” I whimpered, trying to assure myself as much as I was trying to assure him. “It's gonna be ok. Just hang on.” 

But at that point, I should have known. I just wouldn't accept it. He wasn't breathing anymore. I couldn't feel a pulse. And yet, I kept saying he was going to be ok.

The paramedics arrived soon after, and they did their best to change fate. But the hospital report just confirmed it. Luka was dead on arrival. Luka was gone. 

I'm telling you all of this for two reasons. One, to understand how mind shattering and traumatic this freak accident was. He literally died in my arms. That's the second reason-- given how it all went down, there should be no doubts within my mind, as broken as it was, that Luka was gone. And no matter how much it fucked me up, and oh, did it fuck me up, there should be no reason to believe otherwise. 

And yet, two weeks ago, I got an email I hadn't seen in years. 

“fascination-endss sent you a message. Love, Tumblr.”

The email itself, though it probably should have, didn't have the message on it. I should have brushed it off as some odd, albeit fucked, glitch in the system. Tumblr isn't known as the most functional website. But the email wasn't the first strange thing to happen recently. 

After Luka's death, I went back to California, but to say I coped would be a lie. I didn't cope at all. It took a full year for some semblance of normalcy returned to my life, but that was quickly shattered with the news of my mother's passing. A funeral, a mental breakdown, and a hospital stay later, and I was back to living in Arkansas, needing support in my life. I was set to live with my uncle, who lived on the same property I grew up on. It was a sense of familiarity that I hoped would ease my troubled mind. 

The minute I stepped foot back into town, however, all the awful memories from that night flooded back in. I couldn't speak the entire car ride home after Uncle Diego picked me up, as I'd been feeling some weird sense of dread the closer we got to town. Diego getting a flat literally at the “Welcome to [My Town]” sign should have been another bad omen, but he thought nothing of it. 

It was dark out, just like it was that night, and the once familiar streets around me now felt foreign and frightening. As Diego fiddled with the spare tire, I stood rather uselessly with my cellphone light, numbly staring ahead. The highway wasn't very busy, but the headlights of random cars and trucks passing by made the shadows of the streets dance and contort in weird ways to my tired mind. 

“What the…” Across the highway I saw something standing in an open field with a for sale sign in it. It was private property, and it would be odd for anyone to be out this late. The town was usually in bed by eight, and it was pushing midnight. And yet, bathed in the light of a truck's LEDs, I saw a figure. A familiar figure. It was blurred with the distance and yet I couldn't mistake it. “Is that a fucking clown?” 

In a literal blink, it was gone. 

“Did you say clown?” Diego got to his feet, proud of his handiwork, and eyed me skeptically. “Like in 2016?” He found humor in this, but his grin fell when he saw how shaken up I appeared. 

“No, not like a circus clown.” I pointed across the highway. “In that field, it was one of those artsy clowns. Like…like what Luka wore when…” I couldn't say it.

The mention of my dead friend's name immediately had Diego doubting I had seen anything at all. “Your eyes are playing tricks on you,” he said. “Come on, let's get home.”

Even though I'd seen it less than a minute, I couldn't shake the image from my mind. Was it a ghost? A hallucination? A manifestation of my trauma?

A snap of fingers in my face brought me into focus. “Hello? We're here, are you?” Diego apparently had been talking to me this whole time and I was stuck in my own head. 

Blinking away the brain fog, I nodded. “Sorry. I just can't stop thinking about--”

Diego immediately shut me down. “You're tired. You've had a long trip. You imagined it. Come on.” 

I refused dinner, wanting to just shower and go to bed. Living in LA made me forget just how quiet it was at night here. In my apartment in LA, I was constantly flooded with the sounds of sirens, cars honking, planes overhead and people shouting. But here, in the eerily dark spare room of Uncle Diego's house at the edge of the woods, all I heard was my own breathing and the dull hum of crickets outside. The only thing I was flooded with were my own thoughts. 

As sleep began to nibble away at me, I started to buy Diego’s explanation. I was tired, my eyes were struggling to adapt to the shadows in the dark and what I saw was merely a trick of the mind. What I needed to do was sleep. But as soon as it tried to come, it was interrupted. 

Scratch scratch scratch.

The noise, sounding like it was beneath me, made me bolt upright in bed. It didn't stop, but grew louder and more constant. It sounded like something was trying to claw through the floor. Chills ran through me, and with shaky steps I stumbled out of bed, fumbling for any sort of light. My phone would have to do. 

I inspected every part of the room I could think of, looking for some sort of rational cause of what I was hearing.

Scratch scratch scratch. 

The closer I got to the bed, the louder it grew. I stared for a good minute before working up the courage to lift the bed skirt. As a shaking hand reached out, the noise grew more frantic, until I flicked up the skirt and shone light beneath the bed.

Dust. A porno mag. And hardwood. The sound immediately stopped as soon I'd lifted the skirt, leaving me with nothing but the noise of my own breathing. 

Not by my own doing, my phone light suddenly shut off. And when it did, I caught a glimpse in the shadows under the bed.

Was that…an eye?

In the split second it took me to turn my light back on, however, whatever I saw-- or thought I saw-- was gone. I was confused as hell, and moreso, startled. It looked human, but there was no way. Right?

The sound of the spare room door opening made me nearly jump out of my skin. I expected to turn around see a demon or something, but it was just Diego. 

“Thought you might want some extra blankets…why are you on the floor?”

“There's something under the bed.”

“Ah, damn. Do I have mice again?”

No shot. “What I saw was not a fucking mouse. Or a rat.”

He let out a heavy sigh. “You didn't see anything. It's dark as hell in here. You're being all paranoid again.”

Maybe he was right. “I definitely heard something. It was like something clawing. Like it was trying to break through the floor.”

“Racoons.” Diego said this with such certainty that I almost believed it. Almost.

“That did NOT sound like raccoons,” I argued. “It sounded bigger.”

“Boy, when's the last time you seen a raccoon? Go to bed. You're freaking me out.”

“I'm freaking YOU out? But what about--”

“Benny, please. Just go to bed.”

Maybe he had a point, I thought. Once I was alone, though, the scratching started again, and went on for over an hour before whatever it was allowed me to sleep.

That was the end of the strange things for the time being. I was starting to accept that maybe everything that happened that night was just all in my head. I had a final year of hell in LA before flying across the country, and flying had always made me anxious. I arrived late, and by the time I did, I was nearing a solid 24 hours with no sleep. It all absolutely could have been tricks of the mind, my own survivor’s guilt manifesting into a personal horror movie. And yet, there was this email in my inbox from a Tumblr user I was eerily familiar with. I'd helped him set up the blog. 

I've been sitting on that email for two weeks, assuming it was some freak glitch in the system. But today, I got another one. User fascination-endss sent you a message. I was home alone, fighting with myself on whether or not I should confirm my suspicions. I hadn't thought about Tumblr in years, but my account was still active apparently. 

Again, the email had no additional information. I would have to log in. A few forgotten password attempts later, and I was in. 

And what I saw is what brings me here. I'm wondering if I need a shaman, or a priest, or another psyche evaluation. I'm wondering if this is a cruel trick. I'm wondering if this is Luka.

Here's the conversation transcript:

..


fascination-endss: Hi


fascination-endss: Hi hi I'm sure you're there you're back in town


me: ??? Who is this


fascination-endss: wdym


me: What do you mean what do I mean? Who is this? Did you poach this username or something?


fascination-endss: no


Me: who is this?


fascination-endss: Luka


Me: that's the name on the blog yeah but who is this


fascination-endss: it's Luka


Me: listen if this is just a troll it's not funny dude. You didnt know but the blog you've poached belonged to my friend, who's been dead over a year


fascination-endss: I'm not dead


Me: are you fucked in the head? Can you stop fucking with me?


fascination-endss: why are you so mad at me? I just saw you get back into town last week. I thought you'd be happy to hear from me :(


fascination-endss: maybe you just need better sleep. I'll leave you be


..

I haven't replied. I can't. Even the most elaborate troll couldn’t have guessed that I just got back into town, right? The last message also sent chills through me. That first night, my sleep was thoroughly disturbed. I blamed everything on a lack of sleep. It felt a little too poignant to point out. 

Or maybe it is just a troll. I didn't imagine It, I couldn't have. I'm starting at the messages as I write this. Even if everything else is my own head, this isn’t. I'm waiting for Diego to come home because I need some sort of answer from a rational person, but the anxiety is eating me alive. Any advice would be great, because I don't think I can just sit on this for another six hours.
