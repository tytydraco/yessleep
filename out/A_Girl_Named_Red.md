Have any of you ever met a girl named Red? That question is one I've asked... so many times to so many different people. I always get the same answer though. It's always something along the lines of "no, sorry". It's starting to drive me mad.

Let me back it up a little though; A few years back when I was in highschool I was down in the dumps, both literally and figuratively funnily enough. I was deep in depression but my parents were against medication, I spent most of my time at thrift stores trying to find things that made me happy, even for a little. That was when I met her...

She was in my 9th grade science class. We talked a little (as awkward of a closeted-lesbian I was) and to my shock we hit it off completely! She was the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. I won't give you all the details because it's all a bit fuzzy to me now, but she had one thing you couldn't forget, she had this beautiful cherry red hair that framed her face perfectly.

To cut a long, LONG story short, as tough a relationship we had, we had a falling out at grad. We were both going to different schools and different paths in different provinces, and on top of that we had both felt a bit of a severing of our connection. However we ended on good terms and she told me "If you ever want to just chat, feel free to call me" when we did.

I never did. I was too busy with studies, part time jobs, and hanging out with my friends that remained close to home. I eventually got myself a psychiatrist and (finally) got put on depression meds. Everything was looking up me and I couldn't be happier!

It was during this peak when I decided to finally reach out to Red. I wanted to check up on her and see if she would maybe be up to meet somewhere one day. So I called her and... Nobody picked up. There wasn't anything, not even a voicemail. I texted her a simple "Hey can we chat?" and I've just been left on delivered. Of course this was through discord which is shoddy at best so I decided to see if any of my friends had her actual straight up number the next time we hung out.

So cut to a few days later and we all met
at the mall to forget our school-related worries and just chill and joke. While we were eating I decided to ask "Hey do any of you have Red's number? I lost it a bit ago and wanted to see if any of you have it still". Everyone turned to me, their faces each painted with confusion. The whole mall seemed silent to me, as if I had just made some horrible, fatal mistake. The silence was only broken when one of my friend's hit me with a resounding "Who's Red?".

I'm pleading my case now. I swear I introduced Red to my main circle of friends, and I know for a fact that my friends aren't douchy enough to all gaslight me into thinking my first love was fake.

I got home in a panic, I swear she was real, my friends must have just forgot about her. I'm a rather petty gal so I dug up my old yearbook and scanned through it. Sure enough, no Red. Anywhere she was simply had a blank white space. No name, no photo, no anything. I even had the back page of it signed by her but sure enough, her signature was gone.

I thought that it must've just been a few flukes. I must've just missremembered having her sign it, and my book was just a weird missprint where a student was stricken from the record. I then scrolled all the way back in my photos on my phone. She had to be in there somewhere, what kind of person doesn't take a picture of their SO?

So I searched and searched and searched, nothing. This wasn't even a deal of me having deleted all the photos of her after we split, no, this was different. Every photo I have that once had her in it and present she was now missing. A photo of me and her with my arm around her shoulder? My arm is just around nothing now. That picture of her in her prom dress? Now just a picture of the school hallway. A missfire of a picture where she's half out of frame? Now it's none of her in frame.

And then I remembered the smoking gun. For my grade 12 art final I had painted a portrait of her in a classical style (think Mona Lisa like). I even titled it "Picture of Red". I dug it out of my closet to show it to my friends and then laugh in their faces on how I was right and they were wrong. Once I pulled it out she was gone. It was just a painting of a wood chair on a blue background framed like there was someone in the chair.

I was starting to feel like I was loosing it at this point. That's about when I started dreaming about her. She would show up in my dreams, every single one of them. No matter how weird or nonsensical she was always there. Sometimes she was a passerby, others and important figure, and others a nameless face in a crowd. Every time I dreamed about her she's quickly leave my mind other than her hair and general shale. One time I tried to sketch her face the moment I woke up but I ended up just scribbling on my notepad.

The past few nights I've seen her. Not in my dreams, but real, physical, and tangible. She'd be outside my window looking on from a distance, in my neighbour's window, quickly slinking into my closet or under my bed.

... She always looks wrong. Not in the way of she's aged, no. She looks viscerally, inhumanly wrong. She's too tall, too thin. Her sockets are too big for her eyes and her face is always in this contorted, toothless smile. A smile far wider than any human could achieve. She's disproportionate, her arms are too long and her legs are too short. Her fingernails are instead wreched claws.

I know I'm not crazy, my psychologist can proove it. I can't have made up a person for 4 years straight. I know she exists, or at least existed. I don't know how a person can just be stricken from existence only to return to flesh in a ghastly uncanny form.

I can hear tapping on my window tonight. A sharp clink clink clink every few seconds. I'm scared to look at it. I'm scared to look up from my phone because I know what I'll see if I look up at the window...

... I'll see her in all her twisted glory. I'll she the woman I used to love moulded into a new haunting form. I'll see the black ring of her sockets around her eyes. I'll see her meter long smile. I'll see her pointed talons.

I'll see a girl I used to know.

A girl named Red.
