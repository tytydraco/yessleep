Blood flowing from the neck. The sound of the detonation, sharp and sudden. The cries from the crowd. The chaos, erupting.

My phone, ringing.

“It ain’t right. Something ain’t right”.

I’ve known Eleanor for almost thirty years now. We studied in Cambridge together. She left, went back to her hometown in southern Texas. I stayed, worked my way up until I- finally- became a tenured professor five years ago.

We rarely talk on the phone, rarely call each other to catch up. There’s no need, for people like us.  If something happens, we know. We show up. We don’t need invitations, we don’t need updates. She was there when my husband took his life, first in my dream, when I finally collapsed from exhaustion after 42 hours awake, and then on my doorstep, when I awoke.

If I hadn’t felt it already, seeing her name on my phone screen would have been enough to alert me. But I already knew, too. Something, indeed, was not right.

I wasn’t saddened by this death. I did not agree with his politics, I do not believe his voice needed to be heard. I would have been, of course, worried about the political violence, about the risk of his supporters turning him into a martyr, even if things weren’t what they are, even if his death didn’t feel so wrong.

But his death did feel wrong.

It wasn’t because he was young. The uncomfortable truth is that dying young rarely feels wrong to us. We keep it to ourselves, because no grieving parent or sibling wants or needs to hear this, but it is true : some lives are meant to be short. The depth or the impact of a life isn’t constricted in the amount of time one spends earthbound.

So no, it wasn’t about his age. It wasn’t about who he was. It wasn’t about how he died, about the violence, about the fact that it was filmed and seen all around the globe – although this, too, would have consequences, whether people were aware of it or not.

It was very simple : it was wrong.

Something ain’t right.

Eleanor did not add a single word after that. She didn’t need to. We knew.

It echoed. Whatever it was, it echoed.

Since that very first second, since the blood started to flow, time has been flowing differently. Underneath time, a current is starting to move backwards. The timeline has changed. Everything – every thing- is slower now. Your coffee takes longer to get cold. Your day, even when you’re rushing, hold more minutes. You don’t need to be one of us to feel it, you just need to pay attention.

Everything – every thing – is extremely unstable now. The weather, the dinner table mood, the governments. Everything – every thing – is on edge, ready to erupt, ready to shift.

Eleanor was on my doorstep the next morning. We both knew – we all knew – the coven would be summoned soon.

Now – suspend your incredulity. This isn’t what you’re picturing. No pointy hats, no chants in the forest under the moonlight. Our meetings are very proper, very demure, dare I say? And contrarily to popular beliefs, all genders are represented. The only reason men are fewer is because they won’t listen to their own hearts and you cannot find your people if you don’t let your heart lead you to them.

I hosted this one. Mainly because we knew it was too serious to let Mindy and her endless flow of homemade cocktails rule the night, and because I was the only one with a house big enough to welcome everyone. Most of us, you see, tend to favour low-paying jobs, for we are far too aware of the price to pay for greed. I, however, was married to a high-end lawyer, and his greed allowed me to own a house big enough for me, our four children and six ghosts from three different centuries.

The children were asleep, the ghosts silent, the house itself holding its breath.

Eleanor, as often, was the one to break the polite chitchat to get to the matter of the night.

“Something ain’t right. Something ain’t right and we all feel it”.

First round of the table– the flashbulb memory. Where were you when it happened, what were you doing, who were you with, was there music, anything specific, any pattern we can recognize, anything to explain why the shift of energy happened when it did.

That got us nowhere. No pattern, no similarities, no explanation.

Bad. Worrying. If this isn’t involuntarily triggered by the collective, it is orchestrated by design.

Second round – the echoes. The confirmation. The shared stories. The nods. The “yes, I felt that too”. Time, slower. The undercurrent, moving backwards. The energies of the past, revigorated. The nostalgia, the longing, the yearning for past times, a soft, human feeling suddenly screaming and raging, an unleashed beast demanding to be fed. Like an elastic band snapping back, sore fingers allowing it to sling back into our faces. Backwards, backwards, backwards, everything – every thing – backwards.

 

Third round – the action. Tiptoeing. Silence. Sentences dropped before they make sense. An unsaid acknowledgement. We know. We cannot revert that switch back. It’s unfolding. We cannot stop it.

 

Eleanor, the loudest, as always. The protector. The warrior. That’s why she couldn’t stay in the quiet, prim town of Cambridge, despite the history here that allows us to blend in, almost seamlessly. Blending in requires abandoning yourself sometimes, and she’s never been one to do that.

She went home, and she started doing what she does best – preparing people for battle. Oh, don’t be so literal. You don’t even know you’re fighting. And yet, with every choice, every word, every energy you decide to put, you’re choosing your side on the battleground. Choose wisely.

She didn’t need to call me this time. It wasn’t as urgent. She just waited until I was asleep, and with our time difference, she didn’t have to wait too long.

She was waiting for me in our favourite coffee shop. In the real Cambridge, it closed in 2012, but in our dreams, it will stay open forever. We sat. She had her hazelnut latte, I had my Darjeeling tea. We talked about our lives, about our children, about our jobs. We both knew our conversation would get heavy, and we both wanted to delay it as much as possible, to bask in the warm glow of denial.

As always, she was the brave one and brought it up first.

“Something ain’t right. The more you tell people about it… The worse it gets. What started it… Feeds on it, on the energy of it, on the awareness of it… It ain’t right but it ain’t going to stop until we’re on the other side of it.”

When I met her eyes, I saw the first thing that made me truly afraid since the day my husband shared his cancer diagnosis. Eleanor, the strongest of us all, the most stubborn of us all, the untameable one, was… Afraid?

The lights flickered. The lights that did not exist. The ethereal lights of a coffee shop that has been closed for over a decade, in the dream of two witches who loved to catch up over drinks there.

Something ain’t right, indeed.

We left, immediately, and we have not met again. Somehow, and I can’t figure out how, even our dreams aren’t safe anymore.

I’m afraid, too. I’m afraid for my children, for the world that is waiting for us on the other side of this.

 

But the last thing Eleanor told me was that it wasn’t going to stop until we’re on the other side of it.

So I did what I had to do, to get us all there.

I’m sorry. I tricked you.

Now you’re aware of it, too. Now you’ll notice the way your coffee takes more time to get cold. You’ll notice the way your hours seem a tiny bit longer. Your days don’t feel as rushed. Your childhood clothes are everywhere in stores. What was once conservative now feels normal. What was once futuristic now seems impossible. You’ll notice the slowing down of time, and if you truly pay attention, you’ll notice the undercurrent going backwards too.

Everything – every thing – you do is feeding something, strengthening a side.

Everything – every thing – is up to you.

See you on the other side.
