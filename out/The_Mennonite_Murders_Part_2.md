Part 2.

The four of us tried to catch our breath as I drove into the snowy weather. The roads were awful. We had to move though. There was no way to know when those psychos might attack again. They had already likely killed at least 6 people. David, Sarah, the Kaufmans, the cop, Ben.. We were all terrified. We had to stay vigilant.

Heidi began sobbing. It was understandable. We’d all been through a lot. Seth put his arm around her and tried to calm her down.

“We’ll be okay,” he said.

“What if it’s him?” She cried.

“It’s not!” Seth replied in a stern tone.

“It’s not who?” Annie asked.

“Don’t worry about it. It’s nothing,” Seth replied.

“It’s something you aren’t telling us. Why won’t you tell us?” Annie asked.

Seth continued trying to avoid the question.

“I will pull this car over!” I shouted.

“..really?” Seth asked in a sarcastic tone.

“No, not really. Just tell us what’s going on.”

Seth had a look on his face like he was ashamed. He still didn’t seem to want to tell us. Eventually, Heidi did though.

She began by telling us that they had a son that they never told us about. His name was Jacob. Heidi tearfully told us the story of their young son becoming disillusioned with their lifestyle.

She described Jacob‘s resistance to their faith. He didn’t seem to want to be Amish. This problem was exacerbated when a family from the city came to the area for a camping trip. Jacob quickly made friends with their kids. He saw toys and gadgets that he had never seen before. He got to play video games. After that family went back to the city, the last thing Jacob wanted to do was go back to his boring Amish home.

Heidi says the problem was that there weren't enough kids in the area. The only other kid that Jacob knew was a boy who lived nearby. The boy was a few years younger than Jacob, and looked up to him. If Jacob didn’t want to be Amish anymore, then neither did he. The boy’s name was Noah Kaufman, grandson of Mr. and Mrs. Kaufman.

“One day, the boys took off,” Heidi said as tears streamed down her face. “We haven’t seen them in 8 years..”

“That’s why the Kaufman’s had a problem with you..” I said.

“Yes,” Heidi replied. “They blamed us, and who could blame them for blaming us?”

“And that’s how they knew where your guns were,” I continued.

“No!” Seth aggressively replied. “Anyone could’ve found those guns. Jacob may have not wanted to be Amish, but he’s not a killer.”

“Seth, I really just need to know one thing,” I said. Even if there’s just a one percent chance that he could be your kid, if one of those masked psychos was pointing a gun at Annie and you have them in your crosshairs.. are you taking the shot?”

“100% of the time,” he replied.

“Then nothing has changed,” I said, unsure if I actually believed it.

We rode along for a few minutes in relative silence. I could see for a minute, but then the wind picked up again, blowing the snow around. It was a bigger gust than before, and I couldn’t see at all through the windshield. I tried rolling the side window down and popping my head out to see where we were. That’s when I heard something in the distance.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

They rolled down their windows, and I slowed down a little more. It was faint at first. We all quickly noticed at the same time as the noise grew a little louder. It was a snowmobile.

“Oh my god!” Heidi cried.

“It’s okay, Seth replied. “We’re ready. Alex, just keep driving. Annie, take the pistol. Everyone try to keep your head as low as possible.”

Seth aimed the rifle out the window. We were all dead silent as we listened to the sound of snowmobiles slowly getting louder. Then abruptly, a headlight emerged from a path coming out of the woods. Moments later, another one.

Before long, we heard a gunshot. Another one quickly followed and hit the back of the car. Seth fired a few rounds out of the back window, but didn’t seem to hit anything.

The gunshots were quickly becoming more frequent, and I was trying to go as fast as possible without putting us in danger. We could hear bullets hitting the frame of the car, and eventually the back window.

The glass shattered, but no one was hit. I sped up a little more, my knuckles as white as the snow. I tried not to look in the rearview mirrors, but I couldn’t help myself. Annie and Seth did their best to hold them off, but couldn’t manage to get a clean shot at either of them.

We continued to build speed, but they were still gaining on us. They continued firing shots at the car. When one of them hit the tire, I completely lost control of the vehicle.

We started to spin, faster and faster. We slammed into a large snowbank near the edge of the woods. Nobody seemed hurt, and we quickly got out of the car on the passenger side that was facing away from the men on the snowmobiles.

They had hesitated to approach us at first. They probably figured we were injured in the wreck or just worried we would get the jump on them if they walked up to the car. They were standing at a distance as we all took off toward the woods.

They started firing at us as we ran for our lives. Moments before we made it to the tree line, Seth was hit. He went to the ground but quickly got up with my help. It looked like they got him in the arm or the shoulder but he was bleeding pretty badly.

The woods were thick and it was pretty rough terrain. Luckily, Seth and Heidi knew their way around these woods. The masked assailants were in pursuit, but they weren’t gaining on us very quickly.

They continued to fire shots toward us. I carried most of Seth‘s weight on my shoulder. Heidi and Annie continuously waited up for us, but I told them to go on ahead. I did my best to motivate Seth to not give up.

“We’ve got this!” I told him. “Hungry like the wolf, right?”

“Hungry like the wolf,” he chuckled.

“All the music I showed you and that’s the only song that stood out to you?” I laughed. “We gotta broaden your horizons!”

“My horizons are plenty broad.”

The woods were thick and dense. We managed to put some distance between us and the attackers, so I suggested a quick breather to wrap up Seth’s wound.

“Do you have a shirt or a long sock in your bag?” I asked.

“I have a bandage and peroxide,” he replied.

“That’ll work too.”

I had a lightbulb moment as he started looking for the bandages in his bag. I quickly grabbed the coffee thermos out of my bag and held it under his wound.

“Are you collecting my blood?” he asked, confused.

“Sorry buddy. It was already flowing,” I said. “I’m thinking that we could use it to lead them in the wrong direction.”

I stopped filling the thermos when he handed me the bandages. I quickly wrapped a bandage around his shoulder. Moments later, we heard another gunshot, and it sounded a lot closer than before.

“We gotta move,” I said as I helped Seth to his feet.

We made our way through the trees and bushes, following Annie and Heidi‘s footprints. We followed a path that led us to the riverbank. Heidi and Annie we’re waiting there for us.

“We have to come up with a plan,” I said. “Seth’s wound is bad.”

“We have a plan,” Annie replied.

It was good that they had a plan. While looking for my thermos, I noticed that we left the rifle ammo in the car. We kept moving as Heidi broke down the plan. We would walk alongside the frozen river. Heidi told us to be careful because the ice wasn’t as thick as it looked and some spots were very deep. She told us that there would be a spot not too far up where the river thinned out dramatically and we could get across.

We followed her and we all made it to the other side of the river. Just a little further up where the river widened again, there was a large bank. The bank overlooked the frozen river, and there was enough room on the other side so we’d have cover.

This is the spot we chose for our last stand. We could only run for so long, and Seth wasn’t looking great. Heidi warned us not to go on the ice. She said it was one of the deeper parts of the river.

We laid Seth down, and Heidi checked on his wound. Annie began laying down globs of her styrofoam napalm. She tossed a few pieces toward the middle of the ice. We then heard another gun shot in the distance. They were getting closer.

“The globs are down,” Annie said. “If we can lure them to the ice, we’ll throw everything we have at them and hopefully they’ll retreat.”

“Are you sure that stuff will burn?” I asked.

“Oh yeah,” she replied. “It’s mostly gasoline. It’ll catch very easily, and it will stick to whatever it touches. Once those guys are overtop of it, I’ll start chucking molotovs while Heidi aims a Roman candle at them.”

I poured Seth’s blood from my thermos near the edge of the woods toward the middle of the ice. I stood on the bank to try and get some closer to the middle. I made a trail of blood leading past the embankment where the other three would be waiting. Then I walked a little further down the river so I could see them approaching.

Before long, they emerged from the tree line. I watched them approach from my vantage point. They spotted the blood trail. They began following it. I pointed the pistol toward them as they started walking on the ice. I waited until they were at the spot where the napalm globs were placed. Then I pulled the trigger.

My shot missed, but it signaled Annie and Heidi. Annie chucked a Molotov cocktail while Heidi lit the roman candle, held it over top of the bank, and aimed it toward the attackers.

Panic ensued. The roman candle seemed to disorient them as the molotov cocktail ignited the napalm globs. It was quickly apparent that one of the men had stepped directly in the styrofoam napalm. He jumped around, trying to put out the fire that was clinging to his boots. His boots and a pant leg were engulfed in flames, and he started stomping.

The other attacker wasn’t on fire, but he was plenty distracted by the one who was. We all watched as the man stomped repeatedly until abruptly, he fell through the ice.

One second he’s panicking and stomping. The next second, he’s just gone.

The other attacker quickly backed away from the ice and got to land. He was at the other side of the river looking toward the hole where the other  one fell through. He didn’t wait long before he retreated. He ran toward the tree line and into the woods. I attempted to shoot at him, but quickly discovered that I was out of ammo.

The attacker who fell through didn’t resurface. He must’ve fallen straight in and had the river carry him away from the hole. I could vaguely see him under the ice as I walked back toward the embankment.

I grabbed Annie and hugged her tight. Heidi walked down toward the ice. She walked along the side of the river until she could see the man who fell through underneath the ice.

As I walked over to see what she was doing, she dropped to her knees and started sobbing.

“It’s him..” she cried. “It’s Jacob..”

You could just barely see his face beneath the ice, but a mother knows. I gave her space. Seth didn’t show as much emotion. He just had a look of quiet, immense disappointment.

We waited for a while at the embankment. Annie and Heidi changed Seth’s bandage and cleaned the wound. As they were finishing up, I heard the sound of a snowmobile starting up in the distance. It seemed that the surviving attacker had given up.

We made our way back to the car. I was becoming more and more concerned with Seth’s condition. He had lost a lot of blood. Luckily, the car still started. We weren’t going to be able to get it out of the snowbank right away, but we could at least warm up and lay Seth down.

We all sat there and warmed up for a few minutes. Then, Annie and I began walking back toward our house. We didn’t see any sign of the other attacker on the walk back. It took a while, but we made it to the house and were able to call the cops again.

There was a long wait before any help arrived. The storm had only recently let up. Eventually, though, help would arrive. Seth ended up needing surgery, but he would live. He and Heidi would have to endure the mental trauma of losing their son, but with time they would start to heal.

The local media would refer to the events as “The Mennonite Murders”, ignoring the differences between Mennonites and Amish people in favor of a catchier title. We hadn’t heard anything about the other attacker, or if he was caught. We weren’t sure if it was Noah Kaufman or someone else.

About two months passed before things started to feel relatively normal again. Seth was home from the hospital. His arm is still in a sling, but he’s slowly getting better. Heidi is trying to be strong. She still has her bad days, but who wouldn’t?

Annie has been pouring herself into her work, trying not to think about what happened too often. She’s been working toward a big promotion.

And me.. I was numb for a while, but I’m coming around. I’ve come to appreciate life a lot more than I had before. We had all become a lot more vigilant.

So, it had been two months since the attacks. Annie and I were over at Seth and Heidi‘s playing cards on a Sunday afternoon.

We had just finished a hand. We were goofing on Annie for running back to the house multiple times to check her email. She’d been waiting to hear whether she got the promotion or not. We took a break from cards as she ran over to check again.

“Did you guys listen to any of the cds I loaned you?” I asked.

“I like the barracuda song,” Seth replied.

“That’s a good one,” I laughed. “Just don’t break my walkman!” I said jokingly.

Suddenly, there was a loud, single knock on the door. It was more like someone punched it. We all got up. I followed Seth as he slowly walked to the door. When he opened the door, there was a man I didn’t recognize standing there.

“Noah..” Seth muttered.

It was Noah Kaufman.. He just stood there breathing heavily for a moment. Then he pulled a gun from his jacket and pointed it at Seth.

“Just take it easy..” Seth said nervously.

“You took everything from me,” Noah said. He was my only friend. He was the only one who cared for me! You wouldn’t let him be himself. Now he’s gone.. you killed him!”

“We were only defending ourselves, Noah.”

“You killed him!” Noah screamed.

“You were trying to kill us!” Seth yelled. “What were we supposed to do? Put the gun down, Noah. We can help.”

“Jacob did want you dead,” Noah sneered. “In a way, it was his final wish.. I’m here to grant that wish.¨

Bang! A shot abruptly rang out. Noah dropped to the ground under a mist of red. We stood there stunned for a moment before Annie popped her head out from beside the door frame, gun in hand.

There was a brief silence before Annie spoke. She said just four words..

“I got the promotion!”
