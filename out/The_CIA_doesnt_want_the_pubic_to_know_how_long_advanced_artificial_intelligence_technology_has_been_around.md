Listen up, people. Your gut feeling and subconscious are going to tell you that the things I am about to write aren’t possible, but I assure you they are. I know it can be scary to hear, but bear with me. We will get through this. The CIA is the most intelligent organization on the planet, and they have the most advance technology on the planet. They are just now releasing artificial intelligence software to the public (ChatGPT), but they have had this technology at least since the television was created.

What does this mean? Well first, let me show you what are current artificial intelligence is capable of. Go to Youtube quickly and search “Will Smith – nothing is real.” You will see artificial intelligence software not only transform the surroundings in the scene, but you will also see it transform Will Smith’s face into multiple people, including a brief flash of Joe Biden.

The greatest conversation the CIA currently tries to suppress from the population is the idea of how long they have had this type of technology. If we truly knew that answer, we would start to question the things around us a little too much and we may go into shock.

So, what is the purpose of the video I showed you? To let you know that half of the people we have seen for years throughout the news, politics, Hollywood, and other forms of media are not real human beings. They are artificial beings created by advanced AI technology.

This is extremely useful for the CIA because they can use AI to create a person like Brad Pitt, and rather than all income that “Brad Pitt” makes going to him and his family, the elites (including the CIA) can funnel that money back into their operations, simply because Brad Pitt is not a real person.

I’m obviously just using Brad Pitt as an example, but what’s to say that our past presidents aren’t also digital beings created by AI software? The method the CIA uses to convince us to reject this type of idea is by having people like Obama or Trump show up to in person rallies. This automatically convinces us that the two are real people, they must be, right? I think we’d all be surprised what Hollywood effects and makeup can really create, and I don’t put it past them to make a random actor “look” like Trump or Obama at these in-person rallies. There is also the possibility of advance hologram technology existing and this is how they accomplish this. Once again, I’m only using these two people as an example.

So, in summary, the greatest conversation the CIA wants to deflect us from having is the idea of how long advanced artificial intelligence and other forms of this technology have been around. They pump our society full of other debates to distract from this notion, such as round earth versus flat earth, the coronavirus being created in a lab, and they sway our opinions on who we should support in the Ukraine versus Russia debacle. All these events are simply to distract us from asking how long advanced tech has really existed. Do you really believe the CIA would let a slow flying Chinese spy balloon into the US? Do you realize how easy that is to detect? How would they prevent a missile attack if something as simple as a balloon can slip through their systems? They bank on you not making these connections.

Half of the people we see on TV are not real people. We have been deceived. There is a chance that our current president is also created by AI tech, despite how long he has been a member of our current political cabinet.
