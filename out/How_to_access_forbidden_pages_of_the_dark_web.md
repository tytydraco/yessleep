Before I tell you how to do this, I must warn you. This isn't a joke, if you do any of this wrong, chances are you will be met with the worst fate you could imagine. You have to be sure that you want to do this because once you start there is no going back. 

The first thing you want to do is get everything off this list: 

-You need a firearm, preferably an assault rifle.*  

-A Laptop/Chromebook. This device cannot have any of your personal information on it.* 

-A blindfold* 

Once you get everything from this list you can continue to step 2. Find a crowded location with free Wi-Fi. It can be anything, a train station, a coffee shop, or even someone's house during a party. Once you find the spot, pack all the things from the list into a bag or something and start heading there around noon. Make sure to not make eye contact with anyone on your way there, or at your destination. They are probably already aware of your plan, and they will try and stop you if they notice you. 

Once you're there, find a place where you can be around a lot of people but make sure that no one sees your screen. This is your last chance to get out of this. What you're going to see on these sites is not something humans were supposed to see, something far more sinister than what our brain could imagine resides here. If you’re sure that you want to continue, please follow Step 3 

Open your computer and find the public network. Once you find it, make sure to not connect right away. You must enter this exact DNS address, 394.0.999.90. When you connect to the network you will be automatically redirected to the download page of the browser that you will use. When you click the download button the file should be called y7e3j.exe. If it’s called anything else, then make sure to destroy the laptop immediately. Once the download is finished, open it and you should be met with the browser's home screen.  

This is where the danger begins. The first thing you have to do is input this URL into the search bar. If you get it wrong, then I'm sorry but your life is over. So anyway, the URL is 7or2n57n32n0.dwert. When you visit the website the only thing you will see is a box that says key on it. To find your key refresh the website. Once you do, you should get a pop-up on your screen. Click the link on it and you will be redirected to another website. On this site, you will see a box that says name. Make sure not to input your real name, just make up a random one. Now comes one of the most important parts of this process. Put on your blindfold as quickly as you can, if you don’t put it on in time you will be met with the most horrifying, evil, and disgusting things to ever exist. You will hear someone screaming, ignore that, it’s a trap. Once you hear the noise end you will get your key. Close that site and open the one you were on before.  

Input your key into the box and you will be met with a choice, it will be excruciatingly evil, but it’s too late now, you must answer or both things will happen. Once you answer you will finally get what you were looking for. As I said, these things are not something from this world, you will be so horrified that they will become engraved in your brain for the rest of your life.  

But that isn't all. You can probably see a search bar in the bottom right of the screen. This is my favorite part of the page because using it you can search for things that most people think aren't possible, like; how many different dimensions are there and how can I travel to them. 

You will have permanent access to those things for the rest of your life. But here comes the hardest part. 

You see the people that created this are the evilest creatures to ever roam this world. They don’t particularly like people discovering this.  

Once you finish exploring the forbidden sites remember your key and sprint back home. I forgot to mention that it’s best if you have a panic room or a bunker because these people are coming for you. Once you get to your home/bunker get all the ammunition you can because this isn't going to be easy. These people don’t have the budget for helicopters, bombs, or anything like that, but they are extremely smart. They have learned things from those sites that you probably wouldn’t even think were possible. Most people fail in this part, but I am one of the few that have survived this. You can’t make a single sound, or they will find you.  

Once they leave, you are safe. They think that you killed yourself because of what you saw which is a strong possibility that I forgot to bring up. You might be thinking. What did I need the gun for if I just had to hide? The next thing you should worry about is the creatures that you have unleashed onto this world. And I'm going to give you a step-by-step guide on how to get rid of them 

The first thing you have to do is find out where they are. You can find them using the search bar on the website. These things are insanely powerful, but they can only attack you when they're close to you. I am the only person that has survived this because most people get so overwhelmed with how the creatures look. They aren't something from this world. Once they attack, you will feel extremely bizarre. The things you are going to feel when they attack you are not something you could describe. It doesn’t feel good or bad, it’s just something you can’t explain. After that, you slowly feel your eyes close and you die.

Once you get there, you will be so freaked out that you'll probably get killed instantly because these things aren’t limited by the laws of physics, they move in ways that aren’t possible and they look like something our human minds can’t even comprehend.  

If you don’t get overwhelmed start shooting at them, but then you’ll realize something. That you can’t kill them. The bullets don’t do anything to them. And that’s when you’ll realize that you’ve helped me end this horrid world.
