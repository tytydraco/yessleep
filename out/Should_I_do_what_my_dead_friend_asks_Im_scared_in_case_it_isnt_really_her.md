I have a special connection to my friend from school.

She's a really kind person. One of those thoughtful people that always gives gifts and sends a text when you need one. On the weekends we used to steal booze from her parent's drinks cabinet and laugh until we had tears in our eyes.

One day as I was sitting in a starkly lit white hospital room she called me out of the blue.  'Jen, are you okay? I had a really bad dream about you. It felt so real.' The strange thing was that it had been the worst night of my life. I hadn't slept a wink. I heard my voice trembling with exhaustion as I answered her. 'That's so weird Sarah. How did you know? My dad had a heart attack. I'm at the hospital'

'Oh my god, I'm so sorry, Is that- is he going to be alright?.

'They're putting a stent in. He is stable now, but it's been so scary. It's been horrible'.

After that we talked about my dad. We forgot all about the dream. Fortunately my dad recovered with time. We didn't discuss the coincidence, but that was the start of it. Looking back now it seems clear as glass that something unusual was happening.

Some time passed, we had left behind our teenage years in number but we were hardly adults. We partied all the time and skipped our university lectures together. We had a mutual friend called Angus who was a loose cannon. He was a spiritual person. He was a silly, funny, crazy person. He was a really happy person. Until he wasn't. He got into some dark stuff- the occult and hard drugs -and passed away before the end of the year. One day before the bad times he invited us to the squat where he was living. We sat together on the floor-mattress plucking pinches of cat food smelling tobacco from our yellow pouches of Cutter's Choice and rolling them up in Rizla papers. He had hung up Nepalese prayer flags and abstract printed tapestries on the walls. He told us that he had a dream about Sarah and I in which we had runes painted all over our bodies. That wouldn't have been so strange in itself. But Sarah and I locked eyes and broke out in goose pimples "You never? I had a dream about runes too. In mine I was painting them on the wall." said Sarah. She seemed to already know what I was about to say.

'I-in mine I was trying to read them from an old book but I couldn't understand them. That's so freaky. Are you both being serious right now?'

'It must be a message from the Other World' laughed Angus. We all cackled and joked about it but Angus wasn't taking the piss. He really believed in that stuff, it was normal to him.

So that was the time when we started to accept that this dream connection was a little bit real. Often it was things that could be passed off as our subconscious minds being clever. On the lead up to her birthday I would dream about the perfect gift to buy her, then it would turn out to be exactly what she needed (new gloves - she lost one of the old pair). Most of the time however, there was no rational explanation. She warned me the day before my childhood cat ran away and got hit by a car. We just had a link, if you know what I mean.

Most of what I have told you happened many years ago. I'm in my mid-forties now. I have three kids and a busy career as deputy head of a primary school. My life is very different to when I knew Angus. I met my husband in third year and moved to Cornwall to be with him after graduation. Sarah and I more or less lost touch. When Sarah died the following March it was a horrendous shock. I felt so guilty. I blamed myself for not making the effort to reach out to her and check that she was alright. I sobbed myself to sleep for weeks, until one day she visited me.

I live in house overlooking a harbour with a small beach. In my dream, I was standing barefoot in the cold bay, holding hands with Sarah. 'I'm so sorry.' I told her, sobbing and hugging her tight. 'I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you when you needed me.'

Sarah was so calm, her embrace felt like a wave of warmth and light. 'I am at peace now. Don't worry about me, okay?' she said, showing her white teeth in a radiant smile. I woke up crying tears of relief and joy. She was happy where she was. I had no need to torment myself with guilt any more, At least, that was what I thought at the time.

After her death, Sarah became a bit like a guardian angel to me. She came to me in a dream to warn me that my youngest child had been bitten by a tick. I sat straight up in bed gasping in the dead of night, then stumbled around the house looking for a torch and flat-tipped tweezers. Sitting on the floor of my daughter's dark bedroom I found a tiny nymph embedded in the soft flesh behind her ear, a denizen of yesterday's dog-walk forest. Thanks to Sarah I extracted it when it was still the size of a sesame seed, before it had the chance to gorge itself to the size of a baked bean. Lab tests on the thing later came back positive for Lyme borreliosis. They called me to say that my daughter would be fine, because the thing hadn't had a chance to feed and therefore inject the bacteria into her bloodstream yet. Thanks to Sarah.

Sarah came to my dream again a few weeks later. We stood in the bay together, overlooking the small fishing boats, listening to the rhythmic clanking of their sails in the wind. Many seagulls circled overhead. 'I need you to do something for me Jen. Can you help me please?'

'Of course' I answered. 'Whatever you need.' Her black hair was starting to tangle in the coastal wind. She hunched up, shivering. I put my arm around her.

'I miss my father.' Said Sarah. 'You're the only one I can visit. I need you to bring him here to this beach so that I can see him one last time. Then I can be at peace and move on to the next place for eternal rest'

'What? To my dream? How on earth am I supposed to do that? Honestly- I want to help but I can't bring someone else into my own dream. Have you forgotten the rules of earth?"

She looked at me coldly. 'Wake up now.' She said. And I did. In a cold sweat.

The next night I didn't want to go to sleep. Eventually I nodded off in front of the TV at 3am. I was on the frigid beach, alone, holding a piece of paper with a phone number on it.
