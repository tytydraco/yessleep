\[This is a follow up to my post from the other day\](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hfpp6p/i\_work\_security\_at\_a\_prison\_few\_even\_know\_exists/).

You’re not dumb. I know you’ve watched the news over the last week or so and seen the chaos surrounding these drone sightings. I know you know they aren’t looking for nukes. Not looking for Iranian motherships. We aren’t being invaded by aliens—but what’s out there makes that sound almost comforting. They are looking for something so much worse—something that makes every other theory seem almost comforting by comparison.

They are looking for *it*—something they were never meant to lose, something we were never meant to know existed. Something they desperately want back.

I told you the nature of my job, the secrecy around it. I now know the reason they never told even those of us working in the prison who we were guarding. They knew we would’ve said *absolutely the fuck not.*

Yet here I am, sitting in some beat-to-shit motel along the highway somewhere on the East Coast. The neon vacancy sign outside flickers erratically, casting jittery shadows through the cracked blinds. The air smells faintly of mildew and stale cigarettes, and the buzzing of an old ceiling fan is the only thing breaking the uneasy silence. I can’t shake the feeling I am being watched, and the back of my neck burns where I had accidentally cut myself with my own nails. I need a damn Xanax.

The only stroke of luck so far seems to be that the government isn’t scanning this forum. For as long as I can, I will continue to update you on what is happening. Despite how insane this all sounds, I managed to make one critical move before escaping the prison. Using my limited system access, I pulled everything my clearance allowed from the internal network and dumped the files onto a secured, encrypted external hard drive. I know enough to extract the data, but decrypting files this protected is way beyond me. If I can find someone with the right skills, those files might hold answers—answers about whatever the hell I saw back there.

I still see its face. That ungodly smile. The twisted limbs. Harris’s blood- and tear-soaked face smashing into the wall. The disfigured ghoul of a creature shifting, twisting, morphing into the fragile shape of a human child.

What the hell was I involved in?

A harsh light swept across the windows of my motel room, sending shadows crawling across the stained walls. I jumped to my feet, feeling my heart beginning to pound.

*Had they found me already?* The thought struck like ice in my veins. My breath hitched as I strained to hear anything beyond the motel's thin, groaning walls—footsteps, engines, voices—*anything.* I need to get a damn gun.

*Thud…thud…thud…*

My heartbeat pounded in my chest, steady and relentless, until it became something else—*something* *familiar*. The sound twisted around me, warped, morphing into the heavy, echoing footfalls of the creature dragging Harris’ mangled body across the containment wing of the prison.

*Thud…thud…thud…*

I could remember so vividly the sound of the slick scrape of flesh against the cold floor, the metallic ring of blood dripping in irregular splatters as it pooled around me. The memory was so vivid, so *present*, it eclipsed reality. My motel room faded, swallowed by the dim, flickering red emergency lights of the prison’s containment corridor. The walls pulsed with each thudding step.

I wasn’t just remembering it—I was *there*.

I stood frozen behind it, trapped in the suffocating stillness of that awful place, my breath shallow, every nerve screaming to run. I could feel the cold air of the corridor against my skin, smell the copper tang of blood saturating the air.

It walked toward the door at the end of the hall, dragging Harris like discarded meat. And then—it *stopped*.

I wanted to breathe, but the air was gone—drained from my lungs, as though even the molecules themselves recoiled in terror from the creature’s presence. The vacuum around me vibrated with malevolent intent, thick and oppressive, crushing down on my chest.

Its ghostly pale skin stretched tight over a grotesquely angular frame, bones jutting out like jagged spires beneath parchment-thin flesh. Veins pulsed with something darker than blood, spidering across its inhuman body. It radiated a twisted, unnatural authority—less a living thing and more a terrible force wearing a corpse-like disguise.

Its head twisted slowly, unnervingly deliberate, until those hollow, empty eyes locked onto mine—twin voids that reflected nothing but endless, consuming darkness. I wanted to scream, but my throat clenched shut. My feet felt nailed to the ground, my muscles locked in a primal, instinctive terror.

With a sickening *thud*, it dropped Harris’s broken body like garbage, his blood spreading into the cracks of the floor. The sound echoed, stretching impossibly long in the vacuum of silence.

It *moved* toward me. Each step deliberate, slow, predatory—like it knew I couldn’t run. Like it had me trapped in a snare it set. My heartbeat hammered a frantic rhythm, but the world around me remained still, suffocating.

*Thud… thud… thud…*

It loomed over me now, its twisted mouth stretching into something far worse than a smile—a grotesque mockery of human expression twisted by hunger and malice. Its breath reeked of rusted iron and decayed flesh, poisoning the air between us. Its head tilted, slowly, calculating, almost…curious.

*Where the hell was I?*

Its jaw began to open—stretching wider and wider, jagged teeth unfolding in grotesque symmetry, endless rows of razor-sharp spikes forged for tearing and devouring stretching down its throat into its torso. The edges of its maw quivered with some unspeakable hunger, vibrating with anticipation.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t *breathe*. A single tear burned its way down my cheek.

Its mouth stretched wider still—*too wide*—until reality itself seemed to bend around it, the abyss inside threatening to consume me whole.

And then—it pulled back.

I was shaking now as it stood before me, nearly 10 feet in height. And I noticed we were no longer in the prison. We were in my room. It and I.

It looked around, scanning the room as I remained trapped in place. Its smooth bald head hunched just under the ceiling. Blood pooled at its feet, soaking into the filthy carpet. Its gaze settled on the TV stand, where my wallet, a burner phone, and my room key lay. The motel’s name was written clearly, the room number smeared in black marker.

It looked back at me and smiled its twisted, inhuman grin.

*Fuck.*

A blinding pain detonated in my skull, sharp and electric, like something clawing its way out of my mind. My mouth stretched open in a silent scream as the ringing surged, splitting my thoughts like shattered glass. And then—*release.* The pressure vanished, leaving behind only a hollow ache and the stillness of an empty room. The pain was gone as fast as it had arrived.

And so was the creature.

It knows I’ve seen it. It knows where I am.

I’m in a cab now, getting as far away as I can. I need help from an old friend—someone who might be able to hack his way into the hard drive. I need to know what the government was hiding. I need to know what is now hunting me.

I’m okay for now. I will continue to update you all as long as I can—until the government or that thing stops me. Just remember, those drones are looking for *it*. They know it is somewhere along the East Coast of the United States. And they will not stop until they find it.

Whatever this thing is, our government is willing to lie to every American to hide it.

I am going to find out why.
