Except it wasn't a voice at all.

Someone was communicating with me telepathically.

I froze in terror. I was in complete darkness, what was going to happen to me?

“Outside. Now.”

“But I can't see!”

I blinked and suddenly the world returned to me.

"Why did you do that?”

There was silence.

I felt myself growing frustrated, “And why should I even trust you?”

“I can sense your feelings. You would rather die than live with an abusive tyrant. Outside.”

I began to feel panic, “WHO are you?”

“Come and see. I hope he hasn't dug his hooks so deep that you want to stay.”

“No! Where are you?”

“Outside your window. Open it.”

I opened the window and carefully crawled out.

When I turned around to see the face of the voice, I fell to the ground.

“Is it really you?”

She smiled wickedly and laughed, “I told you that I would come back for you. Did you miss me?”

I hugged her so tightly and didn't let go, burying my face in her shoulder.

The hug made my recorder chafe against my front pocket. I sighed and moved it to my back pocket. It was still on, recording.

"Let's go now before he finds us.”

I took her hand and nodded. 

“Thank you,” I felt my breath catch in awe of her, “for saving me, Karmen.”

“I would go to the ends of the earth for you, L.”

She took my head in her hands and kissed me. A kiss that felt so real and tender that I wanted to weep.

“Well, isn't that a lovely sight?”

The sound of his voice pierced my eardrums. 

He approached us slowly, seemingly not concerned. His confidence unsettled me. 

“Karmen, is it? There are quite a few legends I’ve heard about you.”

Karmen gritted her teeth and stood in front of me protectively.

He laughed, continuing to walk towards us.
“Does she know that I just finished fucking you? Does she know that I made you?” He opened his mouth and flashed his fangs, “does she know that you're mine?”

“No!” I said, my voice straining to yell. “Let me go!”

He tilted his head and smiled. “My dear, that is not possible, you are bound to me and only me.” He reached his arm out in my direction and then held out his hand. 

I just stared, petrified. 

He pointed his index finger at me and then curled it back towards himself. “Come,” he said, barely speaking above a whisper.

I felt my feet involuntarily begin to walk toward him and started to panic.

Karmen frantically tried to grab my arm. “L, you've got to fight it. Just because he created you doesn't mean he has total control!”

I looked at her in confusion, “wait, I can fight it?”

I was still moving towards him but began to slow my pace.

She nodded her head hurriedly. “Yes, yes, you can fight it! You just have to concentrate.”

Suddenly, I felt a rush of energy flow through me and screamed. I closed my eyes, clenched my fists, and concentrated.

He was silent. But even without looking, I could tell he was eyeing me skeptically.

A long moment of silence passed. 

I felt myself stop.

I stopped! I turned to Karmen and smiled, “I did it!”

“L, look out!”

I was so ecstatic that I didn't even notice Dr. Moskowitz running up behind me. He swiftly grabbed me and held me tightly in his arms. 

“I think that's enough excitement for today. It's time to go home.”

He started walking back to the house and I screamed, flailing against him. “No! Put me down!”

I looked around for Karmen but she was nowhere to be seen.

“Karmen? Karmen! Where are you?”

“Shh!” I heard a voice inside my head say, “play dead.”

I instantly quieted.

“It looks like your little friend has abandoned you.” He said as he kissed my forehead, “They all leave, but I stay.”

His words made bile rise in my throat but I did as Karmen instructed.

I felt disoriented with every footstep and while I trusted Karmen completely, I grew more and more afraid as he stepped closer and closer to the front door.

When Dr. Moskowitz and I reached the front door, I felt my stomach drop.

Just as he turned the knob to the front door, there was a deafening scream.

Doctor Moskowitz let go of me to cover his ears, “No!"

I fell from his arms and as if out of thin air, Karmen appeared. 

She took my hand and held it tightly.

“Close your eyes, L.”

I immediately shut my eyes and when they opened, we were on a hill overlooking a large castle.

I blinked rapidly. “What did you, h-how did you… where are we?”

Karmen looked towards the castle, “We are home.” 

"As for how," she turned back to me and smirked mischievously, “I have yet to reveal all my secrets.”

I shook my head in disbelief. “How did you even find me?”

She frowned. “I could sense you, some vampires can sense each other’s energy. I could feel your misery.” She rubbed my shoulder softly, “But it doesn't matter, L. I'm here right now.”

Karmen embraced me roughly, tears streaming down her face. “I thought I had lost you forever.”

I tried to speak but a silent cry caught in my throat.

“I have loved you for so long, L. You know that, right?”

Instead of answering, I pressed my lips hard against hers. Yes.

But as our lips parted, something changed. I felt my legs wobble and my energy drain. The legends about Karmen... were they true?

At that moment, I realized I didn't care. I was drunk on her and ultimately, I had forever to find out.
