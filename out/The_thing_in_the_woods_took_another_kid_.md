I tried to tell them it was a mistake to re-open. I told them what I saw all those years ago, but they didn’t believe me then, so why would they now?

Camp Soleil (changing the name for obvious reasons) is a camp in a small town that was made for rich troubled kids. Your kid keeps leaving flaming bags of shit on the neighbors porch? Send them to Camp Soleil where they will make crafts and become little angels. Sounds like bullshit right? It is. They come to camp and clean commodes and run until they are so miserable they don’t feel like being the little devils they were. The camp is very hush-hush, only locals really know about. They get campers through the wealthy and well-connected sharing info with each other. Rarely they will accept locals. That’s how I wound up there 11 years ago. 

My parents never really loved me, they mainly just tolerated me. That is, until I started acting out by throwing bricks through windows and robbing stores when I was 12. My dad grew up with the police chief, which kept me out of juvie, but the chief recommended I go to summer camp. My parents were happy to get rid of me. We were dirt poor, so I can only assume my mom blew the Camp Director to secure me a spot. I was glad though, I would’ve done anything to get away from the yelling and fighting that kept me awake most nights. 

I soon wished I was back home. As soon as the bus stopped we were ran up the trail that stretched on for what had to be a mile while carrying all of our belongings. We stopped and got sorted to cabins, then began washing our dorms and showers with toothbrushes and sponges. At dinner I made my friends with Devon. His parents were in the entertainment industry, producers or writers or something. He was funny and kind. Devon didn’t belong there. His relationship with his parents was similar to mine, except he never really talked to them at all. He was mainly raised by his nanny, Susie, whom he loved like a mother. He only got sent there because his parents wanted to send him to a camp and some of their rich friends recommended this one. I hope they rot in hell for that. 

Camp was like this most days, run, clean, cook, eat, sleep, repeat. Saturdays were free though. They pretty much let us do whatever without any observation. Devon and I were like glue, inseparable. We would explore the woods and began to notice strange things. We would hear people talking but never see them. We would find what looked like bones and sticks making ornaments in trees. I know this sounds like cliche horror, but we honestly thought it was other campers playing pranks. Until the night Devon died. 

We went exploring that Saturday as usual when we heard the voices. We decided we would prank the pranksters this time. The hunters becoming the hunted as Devon put it. So, we followed the voices, which were so faint and whispery that we couldn’t make out what they were saying clearly. We reached a clearing and suddenly it seemed as though the voices were all around us. Devon wanted to run. I should have listened to him but I still hadn’t had that badass mentality that Camp Soleil was trying to break inside of me. I thought if it was little rich pricks playing a joke, Devon and I could whip all of their asses. Then the whispers became clearer. They were saying “come here little one” and “feed the lost one” and “break them”. There was more but I can’t remember. I was getting pretty freaked out at this point. Then we heard something crashing towards us through the woods. I listened to Devon this time. 

We ran through the woods, but now the voices were following and getting louder. Their voices. They sounded like my parents. Telling me they hated me, that I was a mistake. I was crying.  It’s things I knew they felt but they had never told me. Suddenly I was grabbed and Devon was trying to get me to climb a tree. He was following, but I was slow. I couldn’t collect myself enough to climb faster. I was a gutless, blubbering coward. The voices were closing in and Devon told me to keep climbing. He dropped down and ran and hid under a fallen tree. The voices got closer and closer until it all stopped.

 I sat there for what was probably thirty minutes quietly crying and looking around for what was chasing us. Devon stayed under the tree.  As I slowly began to collect myself I looked around and saw that we were by the lake. It was nearly dark, and the lake was about a five minute walk from the cabins. I tried to whisper-shout at Devon that we needed to leave. He slowly came out and looked around, I started to climb down the tree when I froze. “Devon?” Called a female voice. “S-Susie? Is that you?” Devon replied. I tried to tell him to hush and hide but the voice was growing louder. 

“Devon, honey? Stay where you are. I’ve come to take you home. They said you were a lost one. I have a home for you.” 

“There was something chasing us, I was so scared. I want to go home!” Devon responded through tears. 

I should have been brave.  I should have stopped him. Grabbed him and ran. Something, but I was paralyzed by my fear. 

What came out of the woods was a seven feet tall, slender, with slimy gray skin in some places, fur in others, and human hair in yet other places. Its limbs were disproportionate and long, one arm ending in a stump, and the other in a large hand with long razor-sharp nails. Its head sprouted the antlers of a dear and the horns of a bull. It was beautiful and ugly. I was drawn to it and terrified all at once. Devon just stood there smiling. “I missed you so much Susie!” He said as he rushed to hug the creature. The beautiful voice turned to a rasp similar to a fork on a plate as it screamed, “Welcome home, lost one!” Before effortlessly lifting my friend in the air and ripping his torso from his legs. The last thing I saw before falling from the tree was the creature lifting Devon’s poor lifeless body to its mouth. Then everything turned black. 

They said I got lost in the woods, fell, and got concussed. There was no evidence of what I saw and Devon simply got separated and was still missing. I tried to tell them that I couldn’t have been lost right by the lake but it didn’t matter. They wouldn’t listen. Devon’s parents suddenly cared, not enough for them to want it to be national news that their child was missing, but enough to want the camp shut down. I did my research and found kids have been going missing around here every so often for decades. The number spiked once Camp Soleil opened, and dropped after it closed. Someone is hiding something. How has none of this made headlines!? I know that thing took that kid. This time I’m doing something. Tonight, as Devon would say, the hunter becomes the hunted. I’m so sorry Devon. I miss you.
