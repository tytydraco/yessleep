Hey there this is just a story  I was working on and had not gotten to finish it, it’s based on the 3:30 am to 3:33 am rules that are out there. Hope you enjoy.


The In-Between

Lena had always been a skeptic. Ghost stories, urban legends, whispered warnings—they were just nonsense, right? That was until she found the post. It was buried in a random forum, a set of rules about a world you could only reach between 3:30 and 3:33 AM.

Step one: At exactly 3:30 AM, stand in front of a mirror with a lit candle. Close your eyes and count backward from 33. When you open them, the reflection will be gone, and so will you.

She smirked at how ridiculous it was. But she was bored, and the thrill of testing the unknown was too tempting.

At 3:30 AM, she lit a candle, stood before her bathroom mirror, and counted.

33… 32… 31…

The air grew thick, pressing against her like a weighted blanket.

10… 9… 8…

A faint ringing filled her ears. The room swayed.

3… 2… 1…

Lena opened her eyes.

The mirror was empty. And she was somewhere else.

The sky was a dull purple, the air thick with the scent of damp earth. A cobbled path stretched before her, winding through an endless field of flowers, their petals shimmering like trapped moonlight. Everything felt… wrong. The silence was too deep, the shadows too still.

She swallowed hard, recalling the rules.

Rule one: Do not pick the flowers.

She didn’t plan to. But something about them called to her. The longer she stared, the more they seemed to move, leaning toward her, petals unfurling like grasping hands.

A rustle made her turn.

Down the path, a figure stood. Tall, impossibly so, its face smooth and empty like polished bone. It didn’t move, but she felt its attention.

Rule two: If you see a tall man with no face, keep walking.

Her breath hitched. She forced herself forward, focusing on the path, her fingers clenched into fists. The further she walked, the heavier the air became, like something unseen was pressing against her, whispering.

Then, a soft voice.

“Would you like some tea?”

A woman stood at a small table set with a single cup. Her skin was pale, her eyes too wide. The tea inside the cup was dark—too dark, like a hole in reality.

Rule three: If someone offers you tea, politely decline and keep walking. If they follow, run.

Lena shook her head. “No, thank you.”

The woman’s smile never faltered. “Are you sure?”

She stepped forward.

Lena bolted.

She ran, lungs burning, heart hammering. The woman’s laughter echoed behind her, growing distorted, inhuman.

She didn’t stop until she reached a clearing.

A large, ornate clock stood in the center, its hands frozen at 3:32.

Rule four: Wear a watch. Time is weird here.

Lena glanced at her wrist. 3:32 AM.

Almost out.

Then, she felt it. Something brushing against her ankle. She looked down.

A single flower had wrapped around her foot.

Ice shot through her veins.

The flowers… they wanted her.

Her mind swam with images—people trapped beneath the soil, their eyes open, their mouths full of petals. The flowers weren’t just flowers. They were people who had stayed too long.

Lena tore herself free, ignoring the phantom wails rising from the roots.

Her watch clicked. 3:33 AM.

The world ripped away.

She gasped, stumbling backward. She was back in her bathroom. The candle was out. The mirror reflected her pale, wide-eyed face.

A relieved laugh bubbled up in her throat. She was safe.

Then—

A single shimmering petal fell from her sleeve.

And somewhere, deep within the in-between, something whispered her name.
