My mother always wanted twins so imagine her joy when she got her wish. Yes that’s right me and my sister are twins, fraternal twins to be exact. Though we are different in some ways we shared very similar features. While I had brown almond shaped eyes, a round face and short black hair my sister had  hazel oval shaped eyes, a more fair face and long black hair. As we grew our mother pushed for two very important things: perfection and an untarnished reputation.

As we started elementary school me and my sister did many extra curricular activities. We did swim team, ballet, piano, debate and even gymnastics. However while my sister excelled in these activities I was never enough. She bought home the gold while I bought home the participation badges. While she got straight A’s I bought home A’s, B’s and the occasional C. Sure I was envious of her but she was my sister, I’d never EVER hurt her or let her be hurt. 

Once when we were nine, a bully pushed her down the stairs. I watched the whole thing happen and ran to her aid. She cried into my arms as I held her close. My mother scolded me for not protecting my sister, and I promised her I’d do better. However, the next day the bully was not at school, and later we saw her picture on the news. Apparently she has gone missing, our mother and the police asked us questions but we truly had no clue.

 Another time, when we were ten there was a mean dog who often enjoyed hurling itself at the fence and scaring passers by. Once it got out and attacked my sister, mother and I. The owners didn’t even do anything to stop it or console us after the whole ordeal. That didn’t matter though, the next day the dog got hit by a car. My sister and I were the unfortunate enough to be the ones to find the poor thing. 

Later when we were twelve, I found my sister crying and told me that a mean boy had shoved her and touched her in a way she didn’t like. I promised her I’d take care of her and protect her. The next day the boy’s body was found in a nearby park. We were questioned by the police and, once again we truly didn’t know what happened. 

I’m eighteen now, and for our birthday my sister got a new car, I got a fully paid bus pass. I was furious!! I’d worked so hard!! I studied for every class, practiced for ever debate match I even bought home straight A’s!! Still…it wasn’t good enough. My mother noticed my disappointment at my gift and scoffed. “You know maybe you’d get a car if you studied more.” I felt angry tears prick my eyes “But I DID study!! I got straight A’s on my math tests, I even got the class high score!!” I protested. 

“That may be true but,” she turned to my sister “your sister has been studying nonstop and even got her first job.,” my sister looked down as my mother continued  “At least your sister is trying! Maybe if you tried harder, you could be like her: perfect.” I felt tears drip down my face, but I wasn’t going to give my mother the satisfaction of seeing me cry. So, I pushed away from the table and walked away. That night my mother solidified what I already knew, my sister would always be the better twin and I would be the disappointment. As the tears and sadness subsided some new emotion arose, emptiness and pure fucking anger. 

I was so sick and fucking tired of trying to be perfect! I’d practiced so hard for ballet and gymnastics but every time I’d slip, trip or make a mistake while my sister soared. My sister was perfect and would always be perfect unless…unless I changed that. I sat down and thought, should I really do this?? Hurt, no, sabotage my own sister?! Was it really worth it?? But then I thought back to all those years living in her shadow watching her get our mother’s love which I wanted desperately and I decided my sister needed to be knocked down a peg. 

The next day I put my plan into action. After my mom and sister had left for my sister’s ballet competition, I crept into my sisters room and took out her computer. I began scrolling through her messages on Facebook Messenger. I froze as I came to a message thread with a person named Alex, which if I was correct was the Dean of Students. I continued reading about how much he missed the smell of her hair and the taste of her pussy. How she thought his cock was so much better than her boyfriend’s. She even talked about how she wanted to dump her boyfriend and run off with him. I mean it was so easy, I chuckled and sent screen shots of the conversation with my phone and sent it to her boyfriend and the rest of her friend group. Within minutes her messenger began blowing up with messages. After shutting down the computer, and clearing the conversation from my phone I stood up and walked downstairs waiting for the chaos to ensue. 

It was 6pm when they arrived home and boy did my plan work! My sister stormed into the house her hair disheveled and her face streaked with tears and makeup. My mother walked in afterward screaming at my sister calling her a disgusting harlot! My mother screamed at her as my sister raced up the stairs. I stood up and walked to my mother just as she herself began to cry. “What happened mom?” I asked rubbing her back trying to console her. “Your sister,” my mother started her voice breaking “has been kicked from the ballet competition and even expelled from school!” I faked concern “W-What how?!,” I asked. 

“She apparently has been sleeping with Alex the Dean of Students who has been altering her grades and even helping her cheat on other class assignments!,” she paused wiping away her tears “as for ballet, when the judges got word about her cheating in other classes she was given a mandatory drug test. Oh LuLu” my mother looked at me as tears streamed down her face “Your sister tested positive for steroids and was kicked from the competition!!” 

I was stunned!! Sure I sabotaged her by sending the messages but then I find out she was cheating the whole time?! Not only that but she had been altering her graded for god knows how long and was taking steroids to do better in competition?! I was shocked and so so angry! Her effortless perfection was all fake and she was getting our mother’s love, something she didn’t even deserve!! If anyone was deserving of our mother’s love it was me and ONLY me. I had worked my ass off while my sister cheated her way through life!! I'd studied and practiced while my sister sucked dick and cheated and yet SHE got what I always wanted, it wasn't FAIR!! My rage grew and in that moment I decided something; my sister needed to go…for good. 

That night after my mother went to sleep I walked into my room and grabbed a box from the top shelf in my closet. I got on my tippy toes and grabbed it before setting it on the floor.  Inside was everything I needed to finally get what I wanted. I pick up the box and carried it to my sister’s room. I opened her door slowly only to find her fast asleep. I kept into her room and placed the box in the depths of her closet. I looked at my sister as she slept, feeling nothing but rage boil in my stomach. I closed her door and crept back into my room waiting for the rest of the plan to come to a head. 
 
The next day my mother fought yet again with my sister, something I personally smiled at. I had no love for my sister left. Because of her cheating I had been shunned.  After a while my mother went back to her room and I heard my sister sobbing. Carefully I opened my door and walked to my sisters room. This was it…the final part of the plan.  I knocked on my sisters door “RoRo?? Can I come in?,” I called slowly pushing open the door and entering her room. My sister sat in her bed sobbing, the very sight made me hold back a smirk.

 “I-I donno how everyone found out!!,” she whimpered “I just got a call from both colleges I applied to and they pulled my dance scholarship!,” I watched as she sobbed into her hands. I went to her side and sat on the bed with her, feigning comfort. “Even Justin broke up with me and Alex..,” she let out a loud sob “Alex called me a slut who can’t keep her mouth shut!! Oh LuLu,” she cried throwing her arms around me “How did this happen?!” I pulled away from her and stood up looking at her expressionless. 

“I did it.,” I said. Rose froze and I watched as she looked at me her sadness replaced by shock “W-What..?,” she whispered. I looked at her and repeated what I’d said “I did it.” Rose stood up her shock replaced by anger “You did this?!,” she hissed “You ruined my LIFE!!,” she screamed. “Oh please,” I replied smirking “I didn’t ruin your life you ruined mine! With your fucking effortless perfection!! Which I now know is a lie since you cheated on EVERYTHING!! Because of you mom always put you over me!,” I scoffed leveling my eyes with hers “how does it feel being second best, sister?” Oh that did it. That set her off she lunged at me and pushed me to the ground. Her hands went to my throat and she began screaming about how I’d ruined her life and taken everything from her. Now she knows what it’s feels like.

The sounds from my sisters room brought my mother running! “Rose! Get off of Luka!!” She screamed pushing her off my. I crawled away from my sister and curled into my mother’s arms “R-RoRo attacked me!,” I sobbed “I came in to console her and she just went off and lunged at me!” My mother glared at Rose and held me close. “That’s it Rose!,” my mother yelled “Pack your things I’m calling your father!” “B-but mom-,” Rose started. “Save it, I’ll help you gather your things but you will not be staying here!” My mother helped me back to my room as my sister sat sobbing on the floor. She kissed my cheek for the first time in years and assured me I’d be okay. 

It was around 12PM when my mom ran into my room. She looked frantic as she grabbed my hand and pulled me down the stairs. “Mom what’s wrong?” I asked as she took out her phone and called the police. With a quivering voice she asked “D-do you remember the girl who went missing when you were young girls a-and the dog who got hit by a car?,” I nodded my head slowly “y-you remember how we thought it was an accident?,” I nodded again. My mother looked at me pure fear in her eyes “I-it wasn’t an accident, it was your sister Luka, Rose killed those poor children and the dog!” 

I watched stunned as the police officers arrived. I watched as they carried my sister kicking and screaming down the stairs. As they were forcing her into the police car our eyes locked, and in that moment…I saw the realization in her eyes. I smirked at her coldly letting the truth sink in. 

She now knew it was me who lured little bully bitch into the woods and slit her throat before throwing her into a ditch. She knew it was me who let the dog out and watched as he got hit by a car. And she knew it was me who hit the mean boy with a bat over and over again until he wasn’t moving anymore. I may not have been good at ballet, piano, debate or gymnastics but there is one thing I am good at; getting away with it.

I couldn’t help but smile at her. Her eyes widened more and she began to scream! She screamed and screamed saying it was me, I had done it. The police ran up and grabbed her as she fought. I watched with sick satisfaction as the police tased my sister, her body convulsed and she fell to the ground. All the while her eyes were locked on mine. 

After the police shoved my sister into the car and drove away, my mother ran up and held me close. "Oh LuLu," she cooed petting my hair "my perfect LuLu, it's just me and you now." I leaned into her loving arms sighing in content. I finally got what I always wanted…my mother’s love.
