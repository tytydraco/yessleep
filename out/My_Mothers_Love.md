My mother always wanted twins so imagine her joy when she got her wish. Yes that’s right me and my sister are twins, fraternal twins to be exact. Though we are different in some ways we shared very similar features. While I had brown almond shaped eyes, a round face and short black hair my sister had  hazel oval shaped eyes, a more fair face and long black hair. As we grew our mother pushed for two very important things: perfection and an untarnished reputation.

As we started elementary school me and my sister did many extra curricular activities. We did swim team, ballet, piano, debate and even gymnastics. However while my sister excelled in these activities I was never enough. She bought home the gold while I bought home the participation badges. While she got straight A’s I bought home A’s, B’s and the occasional C. Sure I was envious of her but she was my sister, I’d never EVER hurt her or let her be hurt. 

Once when we were thirteen, an older bully pushed her down the stairs. I watched the whole thing happen and ran to her aid. She cried into my arms as I held her close. However, the next day the bully was not at school, and later we saw her picture on the news. Apparently she has gone missing, our mother and the police asked us questions but we truly didn’t know.

 Another time, when we were fourteen there was a mean dog who often enjoyed hurling itself at the fence and scaring passers by. Once it got out and attacked my sister, mother and I. The owners didn’t even do anything to stop it or console us after the whole ordeal. That didn’t matter though, the next day the dog got hit by a car. My sister and I were the unfortunate enough to be the ones to find the poor thing. 

Later when we were fifteen, I found my sister crying and told me that a mean man had shoved her and touched her in a way she didn’t like. The next day the body of the man was found. We were questioned by the police and, once again we truly didn’t know what happened. 

I’m eighteen now, and for our birthday my sister got a new car, I got a fully paid bus pass. I was furious!! I’d worked so hard!! I studied for every class, practiced for ever debate match I even bought home straight A’s!! Still…it wasn’t good enough. That night my mother solidified what I already knew, my sister would always be the better twin and I would be the disappointment. As the tears and sadness subsided some new emotion arose, emptiness and pure fucking anger. 

I was so sick and fucking tired of trying to be perfect! I’d practiced so hard for ballet and gymnastics but every time I’d slip, trip or make a mistake while my sister soared. My sister was perfect and would always be perfect unless…unless I changed that. I sat down and thought, should I really do this?? Hurt, no, sabotage my own sister?! Was it really worth it?? But then I thought back to all those years living in her shadow watching her get our mother’s love which I wanted desperately and I decided my sister needed to go!

The next day I put my plan into action. After my mom and sister had left for my sister’s ballet competition, I crept into my sisters room and took out her computer. I sent messages between her and a guy named Alex which I believe was the Dean of students at our school. I sent said messaged to all of her friends. Not only where the messages R rated but she admitted to cheating on several tests, having Alex alter her grades and even help her buy steroids for her dance competitions! After doing that I hid my most prized possession in her room just to seal her coffin. 

It was 6pm when they arrived home and boy did my plan work! My sister stormed into the house her hair disheveled and her face streaked with tears and makeup. My mother walked in afterward screaming at my sister calling her a disgusting harlot! After consoling my mother she went to bed and I walked upstairs to my sisters room. This was it…the final part of the plan.  I knocked on my sisters door “RoRo?? Can I come in?,” I called slowly pushing open the door and entering her room. My sister sat in her bed sobbing, the very sight made me hold back a smirk.

 “I-I donno how everyone found out!!,” she whimpered “I just got a call from both colleges I applied to and they pulled my dance scholarship!,” I watched as she sobbed into her hands. I went to her side and sat on the bed with her, feigning comfort. “Even Justin broke up with my and Alex..,” she let out a loud sob “Alex called me a slut who can’t keep her mouth shut!! Oh LuLu,” she cried throwing her arms around me “How did this happen?!” I pulled away from her and stood up looking at her expressionless. 

“I did it.,” I said. Rose froze and I watched as she looked at me her sadness replaced by shock “W-What..?,” she whispered. I looked at her and repeated what I’d said “I did it.” Rose stood up her shock replaced by anger “You did this?!,” she hissed “You ruined my LIFE!!,” she screamed. “Oh please,” I replied smirking “I didn’t ruin your life you ruined mine! With your fucking effortless perfection!! Mom always put you over me!,” I scoffed leveling my eyes with hers “how does it feel being second best sister?” Oh that did it. That set her off she lunged at me and pushed me to the ground. Her hands went to my throat and she began screaming about how I’d ruined her life and taken everything from her. Now she knows what it’s feels like.

The sounds from my sisters room brought my mother running! “Rose! Get off of Luka!!” She screamed pushing her off my. I crawled away from my sister and curled into my mother’s arms “R-RoRo attacked me!,” I sobbed “I came in to console her and she just went off and lunged at me!” My mother glared at Rose and held me close. “That’s it Rose!,” my mother yelled “Pack your things I’m calling your father!” 

“B-but mom-,” Rose started. “Save it, I’ll help you gather your things but you will not be staying here tonight!” My mother helped me back to my room as my sister sat sobbing on the floor. She kissed my cheek for the first time in years and assured me I’d be okay. 

It was around 10pm when my mom ran into my room. She looked frantic as she grabbed my hand and pulled me down the stairs. “M-mom what’s wrong?” I asked as she took out her phone and called the police. With a quivering voice she asked “D-do you remember the girl who went missing when you were young girls a-and the dog who got hit by a car?,” I nodded my head slowly “y-you remember how we thought it was an accident?,” I nodded again. My mother looked at me pure fear in her eyes “I-it wasn’t an accident, it was your sister LuLu, Rose killed those poor children and the dog!” 

I watched stunned as the police officers arrived. I watched as they carried my sister kicking and screaming down the stairs. As they were forcing her into the police car our eyes locked, and in that moment…I saw the realization in her eyes. I smirked at her coldly letting the truth sink in. 

She now knew it was me who lured the bully bitch into the woods and slit her throat before throwing her into a ditch. She knew it was me who let the dog out and watched as he got hit by a car. And she knew it was me who hit the scary man with a bat over and over again until he wasn’t moving anymore. I may not have been good at ballet, piano, debate or gymnastics but there was one thing I am good at; murder. 

I couldn’t help but smile at her. Her eyes widened more and she began to scream! She screamed and screamed saying it was me, I had done it. The police ran up and grabbed her as she fought. I watched with sick satisfaction as the police tased my sister, her body convulsed and she fell to the ground. All the while her eyes were locked on mine. 
After the police pushed her into the police car my mother ran up and held me close. "Oh LuLu," she cooed petting my hair "it's alright. It's just me and you now." I leaned into her sighing in content. I finally got what I always wanted…my mother’s love.
