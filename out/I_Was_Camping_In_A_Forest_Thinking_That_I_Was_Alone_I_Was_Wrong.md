This summer, I went camping in the woods. It was really nice during this time, and it felt great to be outside the city. The smell of the trees was great, and I was calm, hearing the birds flying around. I loved the peace and solitude of being out in nature, away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

I had a strange encounter when I was near the edge of the forest, getting out of the car, when a little kid saw me and asked what I was doing there.

“I’m camping there for a few days.”

“I wouldn’t do it. The Father of the Forest doesn’t like when humans invade his territory.”

The kid then ran away. I never heard of the Father of the Forest before, but I thought maybe it was a video game character from a game the child was playing, then I entered the woods.

It was already quite dark when I arrived, but it wasn’t a problem, I was planning on staying there for a few days at least, and I had well enough food with me.

I  tried to quickly set up my tent, but I failed. Somehow, I managed to rip it apart, so yeah, it wasn’t ideal. After I couldn’t manage to fix it, I just dropped my sleeping bag on the ground, then tried to sleep, trying to get some much-needed rest.

The night was still and quiet, the only sounds being the rustling of the leaves in the gentle breeze and the occasional hoot of an owl. I had always loved the peace and solitude of the forest, but as I lay there, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching me.

The trees seemed to loom over me, their gnarled branches reaching out like twisted fingers. The moonlight filtered through the leaves, casting eerie shadows on the ground. The underbrush rustled ominously, as if something was lurking just out of sight.

I tried to brush off my paranoia, telling myself it was just my imagination getting the better of me. But as the night wore on, the feeling only grew stronger. I found myself jumping at every little noise.

It was strange, the peaceful and calm forest suddenly looked so scary. It wasn’t the first time I was camping there, but it wasn’t so strange before.

I tried to force myself to sleep, but my heart was still beating too quickly. I felt like a little kid when their parents switched off the lights in the room.

Suddenly, I heard a sound that sent a chill down my spine. It was a low, guttural growl, coming from deep inside the woods. My heart pounded in my chest as I fumbled for my flashlight, my hands shaking with fear.

I stood up and looked around. It was probably nothing interesting, but I wanted to look around, just to make sure nothing was around, trying to calm my childish mind.

I was right. I saw a few birds on the trees, but nothing extraordinary. I was alone, there was nobody else there.

As I lay back and tried to sleep again, I heard the sound again. It was like nothing I had ever heard before. It was deep, with a strange, otherworldly quality to it. It seemed to echo and reverberate through the forest, as if it was coming from all around me at once.

I couldn't make out any words, just a series of strange, garbled noises that sent shivers down my spine. It was like listening to the voice of some ancient, primordial beast.

“What in the fucking hell is this?” I muttered. I heard that voice for like an hour, and it still hadn’t stopped, but I managed to fall asleep.

I woke up the next morning, feeling disoriented and groggy. It took me a moment to remember where I was. I stayed there for a few minutes, then stood up. I searched for some food for breakfast in my backpack.

When I finished eating, I wanted to go fishing, there was a small lake nearby, and it seemed like a great and fun activity. As I was walking, I noticed something strange.

Trees were toppled over, their roots exposed and writhing like snakes. Branches were broken and scattered everywhere, as if some giant hand had swept through the woods and left a trail of destruction in its wake. *What the fuck is this?*

I couldn't believe my eyes. How had this happened? I had been camping in that spot just the night before, and everything had been perfectly normal. Had I slept through some kind of natural disaster?

I walked around, trying to make sense of what I was seeing. As I moved deeper into the woods, the destruction only seemed to get worse. It was as if something had ripped through the forest, tearing everything in its path.

There wasn’t a storm there the night before. What could’ve done this? I suddenly felt pretty uncomfortable there, so I decided to go home. I didn’t want to stay there anymore. I felt unsafe.

I walked back towards the edge of the forest, towards my car. As I arrived there, I just stood there in shock. I couldn’t believe what had happened. There was a large tree that fell on my car, destroying it.

“Damn, it will cost millions to repair it,” I said to myself. “It’s probably cheaper to buy a new one.”

Then I remembered something worse than the price of the car. I was stuck in the forest. It was near an old road, there were almost no cars around. Taxis didn’t drive there. I called my friend, asking him if he could come there and bring me home. I explained to him what had happened. He said he could only take me home the following morning. I was stuck there for one more night.

The day quickly went by, I tried fishing in the lake, but I wasn’t too lucky, I hadn’t seen even one fish there. I had a great lunch and then dinner, I even made a small campfire, just because of the mood.

When the night came, I tried to sleep again, hoping this time I could finally sleep in peace, without any distractions.

Unfortunately, I heard the sound again, but it was much closer. I felt like it came from a maximum of a hundred meters away. And it was coming towards me.

It came closer and closer. I had no idea what kind of animal could howl like that. It was terrifying. Was it a wolf? No, it wasn’t a wolf. It was something entirely different. It sounded more like a gigantic whale.

As it came closer, I was shaking in my sleeping bag, thinking about what to do. I suddenly had this idea, to climb to the top of a tree. I chose the tree that was the closest to me.

I climbed to the top, hiding behind the branches. And the thing that caused the sound was even closer. After my vision had adjusted to the darkness, I saw what it was.

The creature was walking on two legs, its tall, lanky frame towering over the trees. It had a strange head structure, with a long, pointed snout and two large, glowing red eyes. Its skin was a deep, mottled green, and it had a pair of massive horns that curved up from its head like those of a moose.

I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This thing was more than three meters tall, with long, powerful legs and arms that ended in sharp, clawed hands. It was like nothing I had ever seen before, and I was terrified.

I watched as it moved through the woods, its feet pounding the ground with each step. It seemed to be sniffing the air, as if it was searching for something. I had a feeling it was searching for me. It grabbed a tree with its strong arms, then broke it. The tree fell to the ground with a loud noise.

I knew I had to get out of there, but I was frozen with fear. I couldn't move, couldn't even breathe. All I could do was watch as the creature moved closer and closer, and suddenly, its glowing red eyes looked at me.

I thought I was going to suffocate there as I still held my breath. It saw me. The thing knew I was there. Maybe it could see even in the dark. Then it howled again, opening its terrifying mouth.

I immediately jumped down from the tree. My legs hurt because of the height, but I didn’t care, I just ran as fast as I could, leaving behind my backpack. After a few minutes of running, I reached the road where my broken car was.

I didn’t stop there, I ran further away from the woods. I hid a few hundred meters away, at the edge of the road, eventually falling asleep there. I was lucky my friend could take me home the following morning.

As I was in the car and looked back to the forest, I could see that even more trees were laying on the ground. I remembered the kid I met near the forest. The creature was the Father of the Forest. And it was the last time I was camping in a [forest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/)
