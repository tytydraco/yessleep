I have to get this off my chest. I don’t deserve to live. I should be locked away somewhere, in a padded room, where I can’t hurt anyone. But I know now that it wouldn’t matter.

It followed me home.

I see it in the corners of my vision, where the light doesn’t reach. I hear it breathing at night, just under the bed, just inside the closet. I can feel it inside me, changing me.

But it started in the cave.


The cave wasn’t on any maps. No name. No records. Just a dark hole in the middle of nowhere, deep in the Alabama wilderness. An eight-hour drive, three of which were spent on a dirt road that twisted through an endless, untouched forest. No cars, no houses, just trees. Watching.

I was with my brother and his best friend, Ronny. We were experienced spelunkers. Finding an unexplored cave was like striking gold. Maybe we'd see something no one else had before—something ancient, something lost.

The entrance was a vertical shaft, dropping straight into the earth. It felt unnatural. Like a wound. Like the ground had been torn open.

The moment we stepped inside, the air changed. Heavy. Thick. It clung to our skin like oil. And when we turned on our headlamps, we saw the walls.

Carved into the stone were symbols—not cave paintings, not animal drawings. These were deliberate. Etched deep. Shapes that twisted the longer you looked at them, forming patterns that seemed to shift when you weren’t watching.

We should have turned back.


We explored deeper, squeezing through tunnels, dropping into caverns. That’s when Ronny found it.

"Guys, get in here," he called, his voice shaking.

We rushed to his side. He was holding something—a small, smooth stone covered in those same symbols, pulsing like something alive.

Then the cave groaned.

A deep, guttural sound that vibrated through my bones. The walls shivered. The floor trembled.

And then the ceiling collapsed.

The entrance sealed shut. A boulder crashed onto Ronny’s back, pinning him.

We were trapped.


For days, we tried to dig out. We screamed for help. But the cave swallowed sound. The dark pressed against us, breathing, waiting.

Ronny worsened. His skin turned pale, almost gray. His veins darkened, bulging, moving under the skin like worms. At night, I heard something shifting near him. When I turned my headlamp on, I swore the symbols on the walls had spread—to the floor, to the ceiling.

To Ronny’s flesh.

By day six, he stopped speaking. His lips cracked, his teeth blackened. The symbols carved themselves into his skin, rising like thick, jagged scars.

He shouldn’t have been alive.

I woke up to find him sitting up, eyes rolled back, lips moving without sound. Whispering to something.

"It’s him or you," the voices told me.

I hadn’t eaten in days.

Ronny wasn’t going to make it.

His chest barely moved.

"You could speed up the process."

The knife felt heavy in my hand.

He opened his eyes.

And smiled.


His flesh was wrong.

It peeled too easily, came apart like overripe fruit. Inside, the muscle was dark, fibrous, webbed with something not human.

But I ate.

I chewed.

And the hunger eased.

For the first time in days, the whispers stopped.

But something else changed.

The walls were shifting faster. The symbols crawled. My brother wouldn’t look at me. His hands shook. He wouldn’t eat.

That night, I woke to the sound of bones breaking.

I turned the headlamp toward Ronny’s corpse.

He was standing.

His limbs moved in sharp, unnatural jerks, like a puppet on tangled strings. His mouth hung open, but no breath escaped. His eyes—God, his eyes—were solid black, oily, reflecting the dim light.

He spoke, but his lips didn’t move.

"It’s not enough."

I screamed.

My brother panicked, swinging at Ronny with a rock. The moment it connected, Ronny burst apart, his body collapsing into a wave of writhing symbols, skittering like insects along the walls. They pulsed, sank into the stone, disappeared.

But I could still hear him.

Whispering.

Laughing.


My brother didn’t last long.

He wouldn’t eat. His ribs pushed through his skin. His eyes sank into his skull. By day nine, he stopped moving. He sat against the cave wall, staring at me, lips cracked, barely breathing.

I begged him.

"Please."

He didn’t answer.

I heard them again. The whispers.

"It’s him or you."

I don’t remember making the first cut. I don’t remember chewing.

But I remember the warmth. The way my stomach filled, the way the voices purred in approval.

Then I felt something crawl up my throat.

I reached into my mouth and pulled out a strip of skin. Not mine. Not my brother’s.

It was smooth, like leather. A symbol carved into it.

My skin itched.

I looked down.

They were on me now.

Creeping up my arms. Twisting down my chest.

I wasn’t hungry anymore.


I don’t know how long I was down there. I woke up to blinding light, to voices, to hands pulling me out. Rescue workers.

They found me alone.

I told them about my brother. About Ronny.

But when they dug through the collapsed rock, the cave was empty. No bodies. No symbols. Nothing.

Just me.


It Followed Me Home

I see him in the dark.

Not Ronny. Not my brother.

Something else.

It waits in the corners, in the shadows under the bed. The symbols haven’t faded. They’ve spread. Under my skin, on the walls of my home, in the reflection of my mirror.

I hear them whispering.

Hungry.

Waiting.

I don’t know how much longer I can hold out.

I think they want me to finish the job.

I think they want me to spread.
