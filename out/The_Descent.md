From the man’s breakfast and morning coffee to his drive to the unnamed structure, he had rung the bell to his execution.

The man was not stupid but hungry; He was hungry for the glittering, sparkling words of “Accomplishment”. So his lusting, his greed, his hunger for beyond the veil of his previous accomplishment had made him blind to the warning signs.

As he shifted his backpack from one shoulder to the next, he ignored the silver Nissan covered in a thin layer of dust, abandoned, forgotten, a time capsule of another hungry man.

As he shifted his weight on his thick boots, the space of his phone lay forgotten in his mind. As he descended into the narrow passageway of Earth’s rubble, geologically a bubbling, living mass, complete with a digestive system, writhing and alive, his hands felt rock on rock, flesh on sediment. As he continued going down, the last light of Earth shone down like a stark, white flag, urging him to return to normalcy. But he continued, his hunger growing as he licked his lips, his headlamp providing the only semblance of the outside world as he descended the cavern, unmarked and unexplored.

The cave felt warm, almost welcoming, like crawling towards home, although what this man missed in his descent was the wrongness of feeling at home in someplace where one has never been before.

As he descended further, the light moved from boulders and pebbles, all of which seemed to change in size and shape as his headlight let them fall back into the black void, where there was nothing except absolute darkness staring at the man back.

The man continued down, his hands slipping from each wet, cool rock carefully as his hunger deepened. He only paused occasionally to mark his makeshift map. The man was not an expert in any fiber of his decades of being; he simply justified his descent, his fall as a way for a pioneer to explore the depths of the Earth, a makeshift accomplish embroidered by his lack of experience.

So it is no wonder the spare batteries any sane person would pack in the left pocket were left in the cup holder, alongside his cell phone, and a half-stale container of curly fries. So, when his headlamp went out after what he assumed was only 30 minutes of exploring, he cursed the emptiness and fiddled with the lamp, leaning against the rocks.

But here, deep within his oldest being, the raw human that survived since its creation felt the utter wrongness of it all. The man looked around and realized he had no semblance of his surroundings. He had been so focused on the fictional place of popularity that the present, horrific setting he was standing in, laid unnoticed, like a predator in waiting. As, he was in the belly of the beast, and it was ready to swallow him whole.

So, as he leaned against, what he thought was a rock, as he reached for his backpack, he felt something soft. The man was not an expert by any means; he was something well-versed in forests, in the outside world, but this mass he currently stood in could have been another world, and he would’ve been clueless nonetheless. All he knew was that it was not the soft found in caves, of Earthly structures. Because caves did not squelch and didn’t resist.

The man did not scream. Screaming was the result of fear, but what he felt was unique to the terror of prey before the jaws of the hunter closed around them. Only true horror could make someone’s breath catch in their throat and make someone go still while still alive. The man did not know much about his situation, but he knew, from his core, that his scream would be the last thing he would do that day. So, he pulled against it, and slowly, made his way back. But, as he crawled, trying not to think of what could be back there, he could not remember if the rock he felt was the same one he used moments before. And as he crawled, a desperate man who realized, all too late, that he was truly trapped, he felt something grab. Not tight, not something desperate, but one that seemed like it too, was searching. The man, who felt his breath catch and his hands tremble, waited. He was not a patient one by any manner of reality; he was someone who was praised for his quick thinking, whose friends always described as ready, yet he felt that if he moved if he let it on that he was living, he would be dead.

After moments of stillness, not quietness, but complete stillness, it let go, and the sound of what he assumed was flesh against rock slowly disappeared into the distance.

He continued to crawl when he found himself an opening. Two of them. He felt like screaming, like smacking himself, but this was not the time for emotional outbursts. He should have brought someone, he should have never gotten here, he should have just stayed home and watched the damn football game. But, here he was. With something soft, and something he wasn’t sure was friendly.

So, he picked right. His favorite side, which already served him in his decades of life. So he crawled, like a mouse from a cat, a cockroach from a noise, and he felt utterly powerless. As he crawled, ignoring the tiny bursts of pain from scraping his hands raw, he heard…

It.

And like that, he was crawling, a final, desperate crawl for the light. It was behind him now, groaning, growling, and gagging. It was a writhing creature, and the sounds of limbs against sediment grew and grew until screams and screeches were all he heard.

And it became him. And him, it.
