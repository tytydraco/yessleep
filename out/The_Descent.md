Every culture or segment of society has one thing in common, they all have their own boogie monster. From skin walkers, to ghosts, demons, big foot etc.   


What all of you fail to realize that all of these entities or unexplained paranormal activities have one thing in common. It is always that one same unseen race that we cannot see, but they can see us. True, they live in another dimension from us, but let me tell you something right now, they're sat around us in the very room we're in, they can see us, but we can't see them.   


They're created from a smokeless fire, and they have great powers, such as traversing thousands of miles in mere seconds, the ability to shape-shift and also possess a person.   


I took a trip once, to the northern mountains, where a small town was surrounded by high peaks. The town has a short and dangerous airstrip with a ridiculous angle for take off and landing. Luckily, my group and I travelled in cars so we wouldn't have to experience that flight.  


We settled into a large cabin that we had booked before our trip, the rear of the cabin had a mild descent down the valley which was covered in trees, the rear of the cabin was stood up on a large metal wall that was at least 10ft from the ground, giving an amazing view of the whole town.   


That night, while the others slept, a friend and I stepped out to the rear for a smoke while looking down the descent, we admired the chilly weather and wished we had a hot beverage to go along with the smokes. While talking, we heard a rustling from down below.   


A woman was walking through the descent, casually strolling along, while looking at us. We continued looking in curiosity as it was well past 2:00am and found it odd to find a woman out in the dark, alone. If not for the full moon light, we wouldn't see anything.   


The woman stopped strolling and kept staring back, feeling that something was not right, we saw the light turn on in the balcony and quickly looked back to see who had done so, we looked back for just a second, and the moment we turned back to see the woman, she was gone, completely gone.   


My friend and I rushed back into the cabin and turned all the lights on at the rear of the cabin, the friend who had previously turned the light on for the balcony asked what the hell we were up to.. she asked her to be quiet as we peered through the window.   


"Bang bang bang"   


The rear door was being knocked upon. Peering out from the side of the window, my friend realized there was no one.   


"Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang."   


The knocking was harder this time.   


After the second wave of knocks, my friend turned to looking outside the window again, however this time there was a large face looking back at him with a huge smile. He jolted back at the surprise and crawled out of there. He yelled and awoke all of our group up.   


Everyone rushed down to where we were. Amid the confusion of the group and the glaring questions about "what the hell is going on?"  


We all heard footsteps and someone singing in a lullaby tone...   


"Never.. going.. to.. give.. you.. up.."   


All of us, astonished.. and scared. The singing continued..   


"Never.. going.. to.. lettt.. you... down.."   


Baffled, we coudln't move or react.. what would anyone else do? The singing continued..   


Never.. going.. to.. run.. around... and.. desert.. you"   


That was it, we ran. We grabbed up our things and got out of there, started our cars and raced down the road.
