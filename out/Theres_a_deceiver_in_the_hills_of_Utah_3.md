*TW: Gore*

This may be the last time I’ll ever be able to post. After the shit Annie and I had to witness today, I’m no longer sure we’ll be able to return with our story. Maybe all we’ll be in the end are faces printed on paper posters, piled up in a dust-ridden cabinet with the rest of them. I’m compelled to write these, so that at least someone out there will know where we went and what’s happening here.

Okay, just needed to get that out there. Here’s the events of today.

.

“Hey, good morning. You sleep okay?” was my first sentence of the day, knowing full-well that neither I nor Annie got any sufficient rest. I don’t think anyone could after watching a mountain lion be torched into a mass of blackened flesh and bone by a giant spotlight in the sky.

After we got up, I hesitantly went over to the remains of said animal to get a closer look. As a journalist, you have to overcome even the most repulsive of details for the sake of having an accurate write-up.

As I’d expected, the mountain lion now more resembled a flaky hunk of charcoal, completely burnt out. But even in this state, tiny flickering sprites of those pale flames danced around the edges of its frame, as well as inside its mouth. I took pictures, of course. All the more resources to use later on, however morbid.

Annie stood at a distance, letting me do the examination. She crossed her arms, each grasping the other, her face painted with a pitied grimace. She was most definitely reluctant, but her interest was stolen away after I pointed out the peculiar structure a mile or so up ahead. That isn’t to say she’d brushed off the situation though.

“What is that architecture? It’s so… familiar, but not exactly,” Annie said, bemused, still with some lingering anxiety.

“Reminds me a little of those Hindu temples. You know, the, er… what’s the word? Recursive?”

“I think the right term is ‘tiered’, but yeah. If that there is an entrance, though, it looks more fitting for a Buddhist monastery,” replied Annie.

I searched for the structure she was referring to and quickly came to a similar conclusion. We were still too far away to make out any finer details, but a large doorway on its left side was embraced by a curving, frame-like structure, accented with red and gold.

“Well? Should we go and check it out?” I asked.

Annie went to speak but hesitated, and the words sat on her tongue. She breathed, then said shakily,

“That’s where that… that *thing* was above there, right?”

“I mean, yeah, but it couldn’t penetrate a simple rock, let alone a whole building – plus, it doesn’t seem to like the daylight. Come on, Annie. This could be the biggest scoop of our lives.”

Admittedly, I cringed a little at that last statement, but it seemed to lighten her mood a bit. It still took some more convincing, but eventually she acquiesced.

God, how could I have been so stupid. It wasn’t worth it. It REALLY wasn’t worth it.

We made it to the slope below the building in good time, but the climb was definitely the most challenging. The loose rocks and grass provided poor footholds, and I became confused as to how anyone was intended to travel to and from this place.

By the time we reached the top, we were both coated in sticky burrs from the knee down. Those spiky little balls, I mean, that cling on for dear life, no matter how you try to brush them off.

It was even more beautiful up close, intricately carved supports lining the outside, and the gold paint which glimmered with pride. We stood outside for a while, and I took some photos, obviously. During that time, we neither saw nor heard any signs of life at all – while this eased us into entering, it also had a vaguely sinister undertone. All that was just feelings from first impressions, but we should have listened to our guts.

Entering, we made it a short distance in before a robed figure revealed themselves from behind a pillar, with such elegance that the lustrous fabrics seemed to dance. Annie was startled, but I jumped backwards at least 3 feet.

The person, who we found was a man, was dressed in blue, red and white robes, and had a slightly off-putting haircut – concentric rings of shaven hair centered around the top of his head. He looked between us once, twice, and his mildly irritated expression grew into a knowing smile.

“Welcome, friends. You understand this is trespassing, yes?”

“Uh… yeah, um, sorry. We were hiking through the area and saw this place up above. Decided to check it out. We’ll leave if it’s causing any trouble,” I apologised.

“Oh, don’t fret. This is a place of peace. If you’d like, I can show you around this haven; all I ask is that you not raise your voice.”

I looked over to Annie, then back to the man, and nodded in silent agreement.

“Wonderful. My name is Domimokah. I am a priest, of sorts.”

“Nice to meet you,” we said in unison. I might have butchered the spelling of his name, but it’s correct, phonetically.

“Please, follow me this way. There is much for you to see.”

This was crazy. What religion was being practiced here, I wondered. There weren’t any giveaways in particular, but my attention was quickly drawn to the bizarre layout of the place. We turned and snaked through narrow corridors, like navigating a maze. The thought occurred that, in an emergency, we might not be able to find our way out alone, but I pushed that notion away after Domimokah led us into a long room, wider than the passages before.

The sides of the chamber were carved into large steps, upon which sat several monks, appearing to be deeper in meditation than I thought possible. I could just barely make out the gentle rising and falling of chests, but no other movement otherwise.

Each monk wore a strangely shaped hat. They were shaped like a funnel, one end wider as to fit over their heads, and the other, upper end also fanned out into a smaller, open mouth. I stealthily snapped some pictures of the scene, hoping our guide wouldn’t notice. He didn’t. Thought so, at least.

Annie piped up, intrigued,

“So, how long do these guys stay like this? Per day, I mean.”

“Oh, it varies much. We have no desire nor need to rest in this state. Some have been communing here for months, others a year or more.”

“A- what? A year? No one can meditate for that long, can they?”

Annie’s confused barrage had no effect on Domimokah, as he continued his slow strides down the length of the room.

“As I have said, they commune, not meditate. You are indeed correct, even the most dedicated are unwilling to empty their mind for such long periods. That is not what our practice entails.”

I was hooked now.

“Communing? What do you mean?”

He did not reply, instead beckoning us to follow him to the next location of interest.

After more of the same coiling tunnels, we emerged out into the biggest room yet. The outer walls were lined with small carved pillars which segmented the view of the scenery, and the floor was so polished I could practically see the pores on my face when I looked into it. Incense burners littered the area, and what appeared to be brass tools of some kind were hung on the pillars.

But, by far the most staggering feature, was the gargantuan object that rested in the center of the room. Dozens more monks encircled the object, all still and silent statues. The more I tried to work out what this thing was, the more I was pulled to it. There was some allure to it which transcended any rational explanation.

“Ah, here we are. This, my friends, is our connection to the great Well, stalwart and steady.”

Annie was trapped in the same trance as I, and slowly circled the artefact in awe.

“Is it a tree?” she asked.

“Dear me, no,” chuckled Domimokah, “no. This is what remains of one of the nine beings. It is how we are able to communicate and weave our minds into the great Well.”

Upon processing his words, I came to the realisation that we were standing before a skull of immense proportions. The symmetry gave it away, but it didn’t resemble any species I could think of, especially any of that size. The thing was bigger than a schoolbus.

Scaffolding adorned one side, with steps leading up to the top. The square plate on its crown looked out of place – it looked like a wooden hatch, with a brass handle affixed.

I thought back to what Domimokah had said, and a question came to mind.

“You keep talking about this ‘well’, I’m guessing that’s metaphorical? Like, it’s not an actual well, where you’d bring out water from?”

Before I could get an answer, two others entered the room. The simple notion that there were more people here that weren’t among the unmoving monks shocked me, if only for a moment. Domimokah’s face lit up at this.

“Good morning, Yerhemmi! I see that this one is ready. Marvelous!”

“Indeed, his affinity for the Well is exceptional. I am sure of this,” said the man called Yerhemmi in a rather breathy voice. He escorted with him a monk of younger age, leading him to the wooden steps beside the great skull. They ascended, and upon reaching the top, Yerhemmi gently grasped the young man’s head and muttered something to him, in a whisper I couldn’t quite make out. His face was solemn in that moment, but that quickly fell away to a blank expression.

The man then turned and knelt down over the hatch, reaching out his hand and pulling it open. He remained on his knees, and bowed his head forward, where he remained still. At this point I started recording a video of the ordeal. This was way too interesting to pass off.

Yerhemmi then produced a metallic object from somewhere. I didn’t see how he could have stored it within his robes, but, nonetheless, there it was. It was a large, flat band shaped into a ring, bearing tiny mechanisms on the interior. Slit-like holes with thinner protrusions emerging from them.

I began to grow concerned when he leant down and carefully fitted the object onto the young man’s head. Then, he… fuck, it all happened so quick.

Yerhemmi engaged a lock of some kind, then with great force pulled out a lever from the ring I hadn’t noticed before. The switch was flipped 180, and the band was then twisted around the monk’s head.

So much blood gushed down the man’s face, it was a spilled paint can of crimson hue. He shuddered, whimpered, and cried all the while, struggling to stay in place as Yerhemmi performed one final twist. With it came a repulsive sound of suction as he pulled the tool up and away, taking with it the top of the monk’s skull.

My legs felt weak, and all I could muster was a frail whimper in response to what just happened. Annie, wide-eyed, had one hand on the wall behind us, steadying herself. I forgot my phone was still recording, only capturing my feet on the shiny floor, before I realised and stopped the video.

Sliding my phone away, I stammered out to no one in particular,

“I- uh, we, I think we should go now. Annie, let’s go.”

Domimokah interjected,

“My apologies, but I cannot allow that. You agreed to see all that is here, yes? You haven’t yet witnessed the full ceremony.”

I made a move toward the doorway, and he brought his fingers to his lips in response. By blowing through his fingers, a high-pitched whistle rang out, and at the exact same moment four of the previously dormant monks shot up and walked toward us with purpose. In groups of two, they held Annie and myself by the arms and turned us to face the grotesque ritual once again.

This time, Yerhemmi held a pair of long-handled scissors, and inserted them into a slit made at the base of the young man’s skull. He snipped once, twice, three times, then removed the instrument.

Next in the horrifying slideshow of surgical operations, he used what I presumed to be the same scalpel that had made the previous incision, and began to slice away at the edges of the exposed grey matter. Off peeled the translucent veil from the brain’s folds, and Yerhemmi allowed it to slide out into his hand with a wet slap.

“Please, please, I don’t want to look, let us go!” I yelped, as Yerhemmi once more held the bloodied scissors. Reaching down into the vacant cranium, he went on to cut twice, severing what I can only imagine to be the poor man’s optic nerves, and I heard the monk whispering, “dark, it’s dark”.

I felt hot vomit churn in the back of my throat as the freed brain was held up, like Simba in the Lion King, before it was dropped into the open hatch, and it was gone.

The hatch was closed, and Yerhemmi returned to the monk with the circular instrument, still holding the skull’s upper half. He placed it back onto the man’s head, and fastened it with a twist of some dial or knob.

By this point, the monk whose body had been so violated now looked calm, serene. No more did agonised gasps escape his mouth, and his shivering slowed to a stop.

Yerhemmi bent down, then rose again holding a metal jug of some kind. He opened the lid, allowing steam to billow out, and plunged a brush inside. Bringing it out, I could see it was now coated in hot, melted wax, which he then painted around the head of the newly thoughtless monk.

Finally, he produced another of those funnel shaped hats, and pressed it firmly onto the man’s head, holding it for several moments until the wax had set. It was over, thank god.

The monk rose to his feet, and was escorted back down the scaffolding. After reaching the floor, he paced out into the room on his own, and sat down amongst the others, in silent communion.

I could only repeat, “why?”, though the more pressing question that didn’t occur to me at the time, was *how*?

After a deep inhale, Domimokah declared,

“Glorious, it is. Today, a person was lost, but a receptor gained, who will one day be accepted by the vast Well, and guide us, in the forthcoming days!”

I was dumbstruck at how the man in front of me saw joy in whatever the fuck just happened. Still, a false hope grew that we had been subjected to all he intended us to see.

“O-okay, that was definitely something… can we go, now?” Annie said in a weak and croaky voice.

“I implore you, stay. If your thoughts are of pain or worry, dispel them. We have no intent on harming you or your friend here.”

With that, the false hope was shattered into a thousand pieces, and we were practically carried by the robotic monks to a room up in the next floor. They shut us inside, and left us. The far side bore the same ornate pillars, though much more closely packed together, so that they more so resembled cell bars than anything.

I waited for a few minutes, then tried to leave. The door wasn’t locked, but swung open to reveal two of the stone-faced monks, as if they were waiting for me to try it. In perfect synchrony, they stepped forward and shoved me back inside, pulling the door firmly closed once more.

So, yeah. As of now, we’re being held against our will in some temple of an indiscernible faith. I said it once and I’ll say it again: thank fuck for the internet. I don’t know what I’d do if I couldn’t communicate what we’re going through right now. I don’t trust the priest, but I can only hope that he is no liar.

I would say pray for us, but I doubt God’s grace covers this domain. If I still have the means to update everyone by the end of tomorrow, I’ll be doing just that.

[Good night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/11egv7i/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_3/)
