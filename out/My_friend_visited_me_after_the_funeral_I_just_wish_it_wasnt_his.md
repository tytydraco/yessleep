I keep trying to convince myself to stop shaking, but it’s like my body is still running even though I’ve been sitting here for twenty minutes trying to type this out. My hands won’t listen. 

My breath keeps tightening into these small, sharp bursts that feel like I’m inhaling needles. The whole house feels wrong inside its own silence, the kind of silence that feels held together, not natural, like a breath someone forgot to release. I know I won’t be able to sleep tonight — maybe ever again — so I have to write this down while the terror is still fresh enough to hurt. 

Everything is still smeared across the floors, the mud, the blood, the broken pieces of the shed roof scattered by the porch, and I can’t look at any of it without my pulse spiking. If I don’t write this now, I’ll lose the thread of it. Or worse, I’ll convince myself I imagined it. I need this story to exist outside of my head.

My best friend was buried yesterday morning. I keep replaying that sentence because it still feels like some incomplete lie, like part of me is waiting for the punchline—some twist where this all makes sense. 

He died three days ago in a wreck that should’ve killed him instantly. Instead, he survived just long enough for the hospital to make a mistake that finished the job. A metal pole tore straight through his thigh in the crash, a perfect tunnel puncturing the muscle. They should’ve removed it faster. They didn’t. 

It tore everything apart inside him as soon as he moved. His mother said they sedated him, but he kept waking up panicked, confused, calling out for someone until his lungs filled with blood.

I didn’t get to see him before he died. I kept telling myself he needed space, that I shouldn’t push. We hadn’t talked properly in almost a month. He would vanish for days, then reappear looking hollow, exhausted, like he was carrying something heavy he couldn’t talk about. 

I kept asking what was wrong and he kept brushing me off with “just tired, man” or “just dealing with stuff.” Now I know he wasn’t tired. He was terrified. And he was hiding something he didn’t know how to survive.

The funeral was as miserable as you’d expect. His mother clung to me like I was the last piece of him left in the world. The sky hovered in that dead, gray way that makes it impossible to tell what time it is. 

When the pallbearers lowered the casket, something in me started to feel sick. I didn’t know why at first. I just kept staring at the wood, feeling this strange pressure in my chest, like someone pushing a thumb into the center of a bruise. Then I saw it—the mark on the corner of the coffin.

A carved symbol, rough and shallow, not decorative, not something the funeral home would’ve added. It wasn’t a scratch either. It had too much intention. Angled lines, intersecting arcs, a warped circle in the middle like something spiraling inward. I couldn’t stop staring at it. I asked the funeral director about it, and he said the coffin had been pristine when they received it.

But his mother didn’t want an open casket, so no one else saw it but me.

If I had understood what it meant, I wouldn’t have gone home alone.

My parents left me their property when they passed — a house, a shed full of rusted tools, a sagging barn, a silo that groans when the wind hits it wrong, and an old stone well that sits between them all like a round mouth waiting to swallow something. 

The drive home after the funeral felt like walking backward into a nightmare I couldn’t yet name. The sky sagged low, heavy enough to blur the treeline. The air tasted thick, metallic, sharp in my nose like ozone.

The first thing I noticed when I pulled in was the shed door. Open. Not much, just a few inches. Enough that I could see the darkness inside. I always shut it tight—my dad drilled that habit into me growing up. But it was open.

The well rope was also swaying gently even though no wind touched the grass. And the mud in front of the barn had long, dragging marks gouged into it. Not animal tracks. Not boots. Something in between, like someone was trying to walk with a part of themselves missing.

I told myself it was the storm beginning overhead and that grief makes shadows look like threats. But the second I stepped inside the house, the air pressed down on me hard enough to make my ears pop.

It was silent. Not just quiet. Silent in that unnatural, padded way where you can’t hear the hum of appliances or the groaning of wood or the normal background noise a house makes when you aren’t paying attention. It felt like stepping into a vacuum. I turned on lights that didn’t make me feel any safer. I kept glancing out the kitchen window at the well rope twitching its slow, jerking pattern.

I made tea just so my hands would stop trembling, but it tasted wrong in my mouth. Metallic, bitter. I dumped it out and stood at the sink gripping the counter, staring at my own reflection. I remember thinking: You’re losing it. You’re just tired.

That’s when the front door shook.

Not a knock. Someone hitting it. Hard.

I froze, head turning slowly toward the sound. Another hit, harder, rattling the frame. A picture fell off the wall. My chest constricted until it hurt. The third impact splintered the top hinge. The knob rattled violently, turning inch by inch as if someone with stiff, broken fingers was forcing it.

I should’ve run. I should’ve run back through the kitchen and out the back door and into the trees. But I walked toward the front door instead, not because I was brave, but because grief has this sick tendency to make you hope for the impossible. For a heartbeat, some part of me actually thought: It’s him. He came home. They were wrong.

The fourth hit blew the door inward. It snapped clean at the hinge and fell flat on the floor with a dull thud I felt in my bones.

And then he stepped in.

He was soaked with mud, streaked with rot, funeral suit shredded into ribbons. His hair clung to his forehead like wet seaweed. His left eye was gone — not gouged, just… collapsed inward, sinking into darkness like the flesh had given up. The right eye was cloudy, unfocused, but when it landed on me something in it tightened. Recognition, maybe, tucked beneath the decay.

His jaw hung loose from one side. His mouth opened and closed in short, mechanical pulses. When air leaked through his ruined throat, something like my name slipped out, not spoken but produced, like a faulty machine making a sound it wasn’t designed to make.

The hole in his leg was the thing that broke me. A perfectly clean tunnel through the thigh, the edges torn and frayed. When he stepped forward, the wound stretched wide enough that I could see the house through it. Something sloshed inside him. Something loose.

He took another step.

Then he lunged.

I don’t remember making the decision to run. My body just reacted. I turned and sprinted through the kitchen, nearly slipping on the tile as I grabbed the back door and hurled myself outside into the mud. 

Rain hammered the yard in sheets. My shoes sank deep, slowing me to a stumbling half-run that felt like running through thick syrup. I risked one glance over my shoulder — his silhouette staggered through the doorway, head twitching, arms jerking out of sync with his steps like his brain couldn’t remember how human joints worked.

I dove into the shed, slammed the door shut, and threw my weight against it. The latch wasn’t enough, but I held it anyway, fingers digging into the wood.

Footsteps dragged across the yard. Slow. Heavy. Uneven.

He stopped outside.

I heard him breathing — not like a living person. Like air moving through a torn organ.

Then he continued past.

I waited until the sound faded. My head throbbed. My breath came in sharp, shallow bursts. The rain outside became a wall of sound, but underneath it I heard something else — the faint rustle of paper.

The light overhead flickered as I turned it on. Something fresh lay on the workbench — a mound of recently disturbed dirt, and on top of it, a folded scrap of notebook paper weighed down by a bolt. I opened it.

The symbol. The same one from the coffin. Drawn crookedly, thick strokes formed by a shaking hand. He wrote this after he died. There was no other explanation.

That thought almost made me vomit.

Through the gaps in the shed walls, I saw him approach the barn. He didn’t shamble. He didn’t limp. He walked like he remembered the property. Like he knew exactly where he was going. Like he was following a map burned into his bones.

He disappeared inside.

I followed at a distance that felt both stupid and necessary. The barn loomed darker than usual, the storm soaking its old boards until they bowed inward. I slipped inside through the side door. The smell hit me first — stale hay, wet wood, something sweet and rotten.

The ground was disturbed. Someone had scraped away layers of dirt to carve a massive version of the symbol into the floor. Deep lines. Sharp curves. A spiral at the center. And in that spiral, a scrap of notebook paper weighed down with a bit of stone.

I knelt. Rain pattered against the barn roof. I lifted the paper.

His handwriting, jagged and frantic:

I don’t want to go.

Before I could breathe, the wall beside me bulged. A hand punched through the boards, fingers twisted and raw. Another hand followed. Then a shoulder. Then his head, forcing its way through a hole far too small, bones cracking and joints bending wrong as he wedged himself through. He fell into the hay in a heap.

I ran.

Out the door, across the yard, toward the silo. Rain blurred the world into grayscale streaks. I climbed inside the silo and ascended the ladder to the loft. My breath sounded too loud in my ears. I crouched near the slats and peered down at the clearing below.

He staggered into view moments later, pacing in slow loops around the structures. Once around the barn. Once around the house. Once around the shed. Each loop tighter. More focused. His head snapped left, then right, like he was triangulating something invisible. The empty eye socket faced the silo for a second too long.

He tilted his head upward.

He found me.

I climbed out the back opening, dropped into the mud, and sprinted for the shed again. The rain erased my tracks instantly, but he didn’t need them. He was drawn to me like a compass needle pointing to true north, some horrible part of him reaching for me even through death.

I dove inside the shed again and slammed the door shut — but this time, I braced a rake under the handle.

The first hit nearly took the door off its hinges.

The second cracked the frame.

Fingers reached under the gap, grasping blindly. I grabbed the crowbar and slammed it down on his hand. Bones crunched. Skin tore. But he didn’t pull back. He pushed harder. The rake snapped. I stumbled backward.

The roof creaked.

Then collapsed inward.

His body crashed through in a rain of rotten boards and wet hay. He hit the ground in a contorted pile, one arm bent the wrong way, neck crooked. But he pushed himself up with jerky, puppet-like motions.

I swung the crowbar wildly. It connected with his temple. He fell sideways, but only for a second. His arm twisted unnaturally as he reached for me, fingers clawing at the air.

I dove past him, scrambled over tools, burst out the door into the storm.

Mud swallowed my shoes. The rain burned in my eyes. The shed behind me groaned as he collided with the frame again, snarling through a ruined throat, dragging himself through the doorway after me like a predator that refused to die.

And that’s where I’m stopping for now. That’s where this part ends.

I’m not sure how much time I have before he finds me again, or before whatever he carried into my home decides it wants more than his body to anchor itself.

But this is the truth of what happened up until the moment I escaped into the yard — soaked, terrified, bleeding — knowing the real nightmare was only beginning.

I don’t know how I made it across the yard. I remember the rain more than anything else, the way it hammered down in sheets thick enough to blur the edges of the world, turning everything into shapeless silhouettes. 

My lungs ached with every breath, the cold slicing through my chest. I kept slipping in the mud, palms stinging each time I caught myself on rocks or roots, but I didn’t stop. 

The only thing behind me was the sound of his body dragging through the shattered shed doorway, that wet, slapping sound of flesh against soaked wood, limbs scraping, broken bones clicking against each other like loose hinges inside him. Every time I fell, I expected his hand to close around my ankle. Every time the thunder cracked overhead, I expected the flash to reveal him inches behind me.

I made it to the back porch, nearly collapsing on the steps. My hands shook too hard to get a grip on the railing. The door had been blown inward earlier, so there was nothing to slow me down as I stumbled into the kitchen. The lights flickered once and then steadied, casting a pale, sickly glow across the counters. 

Water dripped from my hair onto the tile. The house felt too open without the front door attached — wind pushed rain inside, the curtains fluttered outward like hands trying to escape, and the shadows bent into strange shapes along the walls.

I grabbed the heaviest thing within reach — a cast-iron pan — and held it in both hands because I couldn’t trust my grip with just one. My breath came in ragged gasps. I forced myself to move deeper into the house, glancing behind me every few steps. The air felt thick again, that same unnatural silence settling inside the walls as if the house itself was waiting, listening.

Something thudded outside. Heavy. Wet. Too close.

I slipped into the living room and crouched behind the armchair. My entire body trembled so violently the teeth of the pan handle rattled faintly against the metal. Rain continued to fall in relentless, drumming waves. 

The open doorway yawned black at the end of the hall, the darkness beyond it swallowing everything except the faint reflection of the kitchen light glistening on the wet floorboards.

Then I heard it — the dragging.

One step.

Slide.

One step.

Slide.

He moved slowly, deliberately, as though savoring the search. Each step sank into the mud outside with a sucking sound that made my stomach twist. The porch creaked under his weight. A shadow shifted against the far wall. His silhouette filled the broken doorway — shoulders hunched forward, head tilted at a strange angle, one arm hanging lower than the other as if the shoulder joint had partially dislocated during the fall from the shed roof.

He stepped inside.

Mud pattered off him in thick clumps, splattering across the floor. His remaining eye rolled upward as though scanning the ceiling, while his empty socket faced the hallway. His jaw dangled loosely from one hinge, swinging slightly each time he moved. A low groan slithered out of his throat, not a sound with intention but one created by air escaping torn tissues.

He walked deeper into the house.

I pressed myself further into the corner, holding the pan like a shield. My heart hammered so fast it felt like it might crack open. I watched his shadow spill across the floor, stretching toward the living room like a stain.

He stopped just inside the threshold.

His head snapped toward the chair.

I didn’t think — my legs simply moved on their own. I sprinted out from behind the chair, rushing past him, pan raised. He lunged, faster than he had any right to move in that broken body. His fingers grazed my arm, cold and slick like raw meat. I swung the pan wildly, smashing it against the side of his face with a metallic clang that shook my bones.

He reeled sideways but didn’t fall. He turned back toward me, and for the first time, I felt the full weight of the wrongness in him — not just death, not just decay, but something else coiled inside, something that moved his limbs with the wrong rhythm, the wrong purpose. The eye socket pulsed faintly, like something beneath the bone shifted.

I ran.

I barreled down the hallway, slipping on the wet boards. He followed, each step thudding in a way that didn’t match the movement of his legs. 

He didn’t limp from the hole in his thigh — he barely acknowledged it. He moved like the pain in him no longer belonged to him, like the body was only a vessel being pushed, dragged, and reshaped by something that wanted out.

I turned into my father’s old office and slammed the door. It didn’t have a lock. I pressed the desk chair under the knob as hard as I could and backed away, chest heaving. The window rattled in the wind. The only light came from a dim lamp in the corner, casting long, shaky shadows across the room.

The door shook violently as he slammed into it. The wood bowed inward. Dust fell from the ceiling. The chair scraped across the floor half an inch with each impact. His groaning grew louder, more frustrated, more guttural. I backed toward the window and pushed it open, rain pouring inside instantly.

The chair snapped.

The door burst inward.

He came through like a storm — arms jerking, fingers curled, mouth hanging open in a broken snarl. His suit tore further as he dragged himself across the threshold, smearing mud and blood across the carpet. His spine bent in a way no spine should, bones protruding under torn flesh.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. I dove out the window into the rain and hit the ground hard, rolling through the mud until my shoulder slammed into the stone wall of the well. Lightning split the sky. 

The yard lit up in a stark flash — and in that moment, I saw him in the office window behind me. His head twisted at an impossible angle as he leaned out, his body folding forward like a broken puppet. He didn’t jump. He fell, crashed into the mud with a wet crack, limbs bending in multiple directions.

Then he got back up.

I ran.

My legs ached, burning, slipping on the wet ground. I made my way to the one place I swore I wouldn’t go — the barn. 

Rain pounded the roof in deafening sheets as I stumbled inside. I slammed the door behind me and dragged a heavy workbench against it, bracing it with everything I had left. My breath came in ragged gasps. I stumbled to the back of the barn, collapsing against the hay bales.

For a moment, the only sound was thunder.

Then I heard him.

A long, rattling groan from outside. Then another. Then fingers scraping slowly across the barn boards, searching, testing, dragging across the grain like nails across skin. 

He circled the barn once. Twice. Each pass closer than the last. His dragging steps pulse in too-long intervals now, like something inside him is deciding which limb to move next.

I covered my mouth to muffle my breathing.

The barn roof groaned under the storm. Water dripped through the old boards in irregular patterns. The symbol carved into the floor — the enormous one, the one he must have made before he died — looked darker now, grooves filled with rainwater like open wounds.

His hand slapped against the outside wall inches from my face.

I bit down on my knuckles to keep from screaming. The boards bowed slightly inward. His fingertips pushed through the gaps, writhing, searching, bending in unnatural directions as if joints had become optional.

Then — silence.

Not the silence of him leaving.

The silence of him deciding.

I didn’t dare move.

The next sound came from above.

One step.

Creak.

Another step.

Creak.

He was climbing the support beams from the outside.

The roof above me dipped under his weight.

I pushed myself deeper into the barn, heart slamming against my ribs. Rain hit the roof harder, drowning out every logical thought. I didn’t breathe. I didn’t blink. I just waited for the boards to give way under him.

When they did, the world shattered.

The roof exploded inward as his body plummeted through. Splinters rained down like knives. He slammed into the hay bales with a force that shook the entire barn. Dust exploded into the air. His limbs twisted, straightened, twisted again. His head rolled to the side, the empty socket facing me.

Then he moved.

He lunged, fingers clawing into the hay, dragging himself toward me with a violent, animal intent. His jaw snapped open and shut, producing wet clicking noises. His ribs shifted with every movement, some sticking out through the torn shirt.

I scrambled backward, hands digging into loose straw and dirt. My shoulder hit a rake. I grabbed it without thinking and swung. The handle cracked against his skull, but he didn’t falter. He clawed forward, pulling himself faster, ignoring the way his leg bent inward at a sick angle.

He grabbed my ankle.

Pain shot up my leg as his fingers sank into my skin. I kicked wildly, connecting with his face. His head jerked to the side but his grip tightened. He pulled. I slid across the hay, closer to him, closer to the stench of rot and mud and the metallic stink leaking from the hole in his leg.

I grabbed the metal pole he’d fallen through earlier — some old scaffolding rod from the roof repairs my father never finished. I swung it downward, smashing it into his arm. Bone cracked. He didn’t let go. He pulled harder, snarling through shredded vocal cords.

I screamed — a raw, desperate sound that tore through my throat. I swung the pole again, harder, aiming for his head this time. It struck with a dull, sickening thud. His grip loosened. I kicked free and stumbled backward, slipping in the mud and hay.

He rose onto his hands and knees like something dragged on invisible strings.

I didn’t wait for him to stand.

I bolted.

Out the barn door, across the yard, through the sideways rain. My lungs burned. My legs felt like lead. Every sound felt like it came from him. Every shadow looked like his silhouette.

I made it back to the house and slammed the busted doorframe shut out of instinct even though it wouldn’t hold anything. I collapsed against the wall, drenched, shaking, barely able to breathe.

He wasn’t dead.

He wasn’t even slowing down.

And nothing — not broken bones, not smashed limbs, not the limits of a corpse — would stop him.

Something else was moving him.

And it wanted me.

I don’t know how long I sat there on the floor, listening for him. The storm had softened to a steady hiss, but my ears still rang with phantom sounds—his dragging steps, the snap of his bones when he hit the shed floor, the way the barn roof groaned beneath the weight of something that should’ve stayed buried. 

The house felt smaller now, like the walls had crept inward while I was outside fighting for my life. Every shadow felt deeper. Every window felt too open. Every breath hurt. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I kept wondering if I was already dead and this was what grief did to a brain too broken to process reality.

Then I heard the porch boards creak.

Slowly.

Deliberately.

One step.

Another.

He hadn’t run after me. He hadn’t stumbled blindly. He had simply followed whatever invisible thread tied him to me with the same quiet, unsettling confidence he’d shown all night. The boards bent under his weight. Mud squelched as he stepped closer to the wrecked doorway. A soft, wet drag followed behind him like something still trailing from his body.

I held my breath.

His silhouette appeared in the doorway.

He didn’t crash in this time. He didn’t fling himself forward like a feral animal. He stood there—crooked, torn open, dripping—head tilted like he was listening to something I couldn’t hear. His remaining eye reflected a sliver of kitchen light, milky and unfocused. The empty socket looked darker now, as if something deeper inside him had taken root.

He stepped into the house.

The floorboards groaned under him. His left leg bent inward at the knee, but he didn’t favor it. His spine shifted under his shirt—bones grinding together in small, painful jerks. His arms hung at his sides, fingers twitching in rhythmic spasms like they were remembering what they used to hold.

I tried to stand. My legs nearly gave out. I pressed my hand against the wall to steady myself, the pan long gone, the rake snapped in the barn, the crowbar somewhere outside in the mud. I felt naked in a way I’d never felt before—no weapon, no plan, nothing between me and the thing wearing my best friend’s face except a few feet of rotting flooring.

He took another step toward me.

Something inside him clicked loudly—a grinding pop like a gear locking into place. His head snapped toward me with violent precision, his jaw swinging loosely. A sound leaked out, part wheeze, part broken attempt at forming my name. Except it wasn’t right. The sound was too low, too warped, too forced through a shape that wasn’t meant to make language anymore.

He lunged.

I turned and sprinted down the hall, my shoulder catching the edge of the wall hard enough to send a jolt through my arm. Pain exploded in my ribs. I didn’t stop. I ran for the bedroom at the end of the hall, the one with the window facing the well. I didn’t think—my body just decided that room was the best place to make a stand. Maybe it was the only place left with something inside worth using.

I slammed the door and shoved the dresser in front of it. His body collided with the other side instantly. The wood shuddered. Dust fell from the ceiling. Another impact. Another. Each hit stronger, faster, more desperate. The dresser’s legs scraped across the floor inch by inch.

I scanned the room for anything I could use. My eyes landed on the old metal pole propped in the corner—the one my dad had kept as a makeshift curtain rod years ago before he replaced it. It had been sitting in the corner for months, forgotten, slightly rusted, heavier than it looked. I grabbed it with both hands. It felt cold, solid, familiar in a way that scared me.

The doorframe cracked.

His hand burst through, fingers clawing wildly, skin peeling from the knuckles. He didn’t try the handle. He didn’t try to force the door open in any logical way. He tore at the wood like an animal digging through the earth. His wrist bent backward at a horrific angle as he reached deeper inside.

The dresser slid another inch.

The door hinges snapped.

He pushed through.

The dresser toppled sideways, crashing to the floor. His body fell forward with it, limbs flailing in a heap of wet clothes and broken bone. But he didn’t stay down. He rose slowly, joints popping in rapid succession. His head rolled to one side, the jaw dangling uselessly.

He took one step toward me.

I struck him with the pole.

The sound vibrated up my arms — a dull, sickening thud as metal connected with bone. His head jerked back. His body didn’t. He staggered only slightly before lunging again, arms outstretched, fingers curled like claws. I swung again, smashing the pole into his shoulder. The bone cracked audibly. His arm hung loose, swaying with each step, but he didn’t stop.

He grabbed the pole with his other hand.

His grip was impossibly strong.

He pulled.

We both fell back onto the bed, the mattress collapsing beneath our weight. He landed on top of me, reeking of earth and rot and something older, something deeper.

His chest caved inward as he pressed down, ribs snapping inward. His breath gurgled wetly against my neck. I shoved the pole upward, pressing it between us, pushing against his throat, but he didn’t choke. He didn’t react at all. He simply pushed harder.

His hand slid toward my face.

I felt his fingers graze my cheek.

And something inside me snapped.

I twisted the pole sideways, jamming one end into the hole in his thigh.

He paused.

For the first time all night, he paused.

His whole body trembled. His head twitched violently. His mouth opened wide, wider than a broken jaw should allow. A sound poured out of him — not a growl, not a moan, but a deep, guttural groan that vibrated through my bones. It felt like something inside the hole in his leg had been waiting for this moment.

I pushed harder.

The pole slid deeper, scraping bone, tearing through ruined muscle. He convulsed, body jerking backward, limbs spasming. His grip loosened. I shoved him off the bed and onto the floor with a heavy thud.

He writhed, twisting like something inside him was fighting to stay connected.

I didn’t hesitate.

I grabbed the pole with both hands, braced my foot against his hip, and pulled.

The pole tore free.

It came out with a sickening wet suction, a long, thick string of tissue clinging to the metal before snapping loose.

He went still.

Then he screamed — or tried to. The sound that escaped was hollow, empty, like wind howling through a tunnel. His arms flailed. His legs kicked. His back arched high enough that his spine protruded through his skin.

I lifted the pole.

He reached toward me one last time.

I brought the pole down.

Once.

Twice.

Again.

Again.

I don’t know how many times. I don’t know if I was hitting him or hitting the months of guilt or the funeral or the carved symbol or the memory of him carving it or the way the storm seemed to lean closer with every swing. All I knew was that by the time my arms gave out, his body wasn’t moving.

I don’t remember dragging him outside.

I don’t remember slipping on the mud or the way his limbs kept catching on the grass.

I don’t remember the storm ending.

I don’t remember the rope swaying on the well.

I only remember pushing his ruined body over the stone rim.
It fell silently.

Like the well swallowed the sound itself.

I stood there for a long time after, staring into the darkness, waiting for something—anything—to echo back.

Nothing did.

The yard was quiet.

The house was quiet.

The whole world felt quiet.

But the quiet didn’t feel safe.

It felt full.

Like something was holding its breath.

Like something was thinking.

Like something wasn’t finished.

I came back inside and sat down at this desk.
I washed my hands three times but they still smell like the pole, like the wet earth from the barn, like the thing inside the hole in his leg that tried to follow me home.

I’m writing this because I need someone to know what happened.

Because the house feels wrong again.

Because the silence feels heavier now than it did before.

Because I keep hearing faint dripping sounds under the floorboards.

Because I keep seeing the rope on the well sway when there’s no wind.

Because I keep thinking about the symbol he carved everywhere he went.

Because I keep thinking maybe the ritual didn’t fail.

Maybe it succeeded.

Just not in the way he expected.

Something is moving outside.

Something wet.

Something slow.

Something that remembers me.
