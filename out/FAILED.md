How did i come up with this story? I had a dream

I was in a valley at night with a girl, and few guys were beating the shit out of us, tormenting us, the girl lost her throat while screaming. When I woke up, i remember few things from the dream and decided to tell a friend of mine, he's a writer, he likes to write and together, we thought why not craft a story out of it?

Neither of us expected how challenging it would be. I’ve never written anything before and despite our efforts to create a perfect novel-like story, we faced many setbacks. Finally, I decided to try a different approach: crafting this short story without diving into the full context right away.

This is a gamble. If it resonates with you and gains attention, it will motivate us to keep building this world and exploring its backstories and future events. But if it doesn’t, we might need to start fresh.

We chose to write this in a novel-like format, complete with dialogue, to give it depth. While it contains violence, it’s not just for shock value, it’s essential to the events we’ve envisioned for this world. Every detail has been carefully chosen to hook your attention and leave you wanting more.

We hope you enjoy this glimpse into what could become something much bigger. Your feedback and support mean the world to us.

It was an ordinary afternoon when Ali walked into the library, his hands clutching the book he had borrowed, barely aware of anything around him. He almost missed her at first-Zaira, sitting alone by the window. When he noticed her, his heart lurched. She glanced up, caught his eye and smiled.

"Hey, Ali! What book do you have there?" she asked

Ali fumbled with the book, his face turning red but he managed to respond, telling her about the topic. To his surprise, Zaira was interested. She leaned in asking questions and her curiosity bringing him out of his shell just a little. He started talking.

But as they spoke Ali didn’t notice someone moving in the doorway. Kenny stepped in, his expression unreadable. At first he watched quietly from a distance observing Ali and Zaira. It was like he was calculating, taking in every small detail of their interaction. Ali who was too engrossed in the conversation only noticed him when he felt a heavy hand clap down on his shoulder.

"Well, well, what do we have here?" Kenny’s voice was thick with mockery as he looked from Ali to Zaira. "Didn’t know you were into geeks, Zaira."

Zaira’s smile faded as she glanced at Kenny, her usual calmness beginning to slip. "Kenny, leave him alone. He’s not bothering anyone."

But Kenny ignored her pulling a chair over and positioning himself right next to Ali. "Oh, I’m not bothering him. We’re friends, right, Ali?" He gave Ali a rough shake, forcing him to nod along, the words he wanted to say stuck in his throat. Ali could feel his skin crawling under Kenny’s grip, a sickening feeling of dread settling in his stomach as he realized that no one else was around except for Kenny's three friends. The library was eerily silent.

Kenny leaned in lowering his voice so only Ali and Zaira could hear. "You’re lucky to even get a word with her. Girls like her don’t waste time on shits like you." He turned his gaze to Zaira, his eyes lingering in a way that made her visibly uncomfortable. Zaira shifted back slightly trying to maintain her composure.

"Stop it, Kenny. You’re making him uncomfortable."

"Oh, am I?" Kenny's voice was a low growl. He reached out, brushing his fingers over her shoulder in a way that made her tense.

Ali, who was already shaking realized what Kenny was doing. "Kenny…stop. Just…leave her alone," Ali said, his voice trembling.

But Kenny’s smirk only widened. He looked at his friends, signaling to them. Suddenly, they moved to close the library door, securing the lock and cutting off any chance of escape.

"You really think you can tell me what to do?" He shoved Ali backward sending him sprawling onto the floor. Before he could react two of Kenny’s friends held him down, forcing him to watch as Kenny turned his attention fully to Zaira.

"Kenny, please, just…stop this," Zaira’s voice was breaking, the fear clear in her eyes. Ali struggled against the grip of Kenny’s friends, his heart racing. He watched as Kenny moved toward Zaira, his smirk widening feeding off the fear and tension in the room. Ali’s mind was clouded with dread, his voice hoarse as he pleaded, "Kenny, please… just leave her alone."

Kenny only chuckled, shaking his head in mock pity. "Look at you. Weak, pathetic. You’re begging me? Like that’s going to change anything?" Zaira, still trying to keep her composure, took a step back, her back hitting the shelves.

"Kenny, this isn’t funny anymore. Let us go, or I’ll… I’ll tell someone."

"You think anyone’s going to believe you? Who do you think they’ll believe?" Ali’s heart pounded as he saw the fear in Zaira’s eyes deepen. He could feel his throat closing up as he watched Kenny lean in close to Zaira, reaching out to brush a hand against her cheek. Zaira flinched, trying to push him away, but he only tightened his grip, forcing her to look up at him.

The three friends holding Ali down were laughing under their breath, reveling in his helplessness. Kenny’s grip on Zaira only grew rougher, his touch becoming more invasive. Ali’s pleas turned to desperate shouts, his body struggling against the hands that pinned him down.

"Let… her… go!" Ali’s voice cracked. But his resistance only made Kenny’s friends tighten their hold, pressing him harder against the floor.

The desperation in Zaira’s eyes stabbed at his heart, each tear she shed fueling the raw agony that twisted inside him.

"Please… Kenny… I’m begging you," Ali’s voice broke, trembling as he choked out each word. But the more he begged, the more Kenny’s expression twisted with cruel satisfaction, his actions becoming increasingly vile. Ali’s mind flashed back to all the times he’d tried to avoid Kenny in the hallways, the quiet moments when he’d convinced himself that staying unnoticed would keep him safe.

His entire life felt like a hollow lie, his quiet resolve nothing more than cowardice in disguise.

As Kenny’s friends continued to hold him down, Ali’s vision blurred.

Zaira’s plea only seemed to escalate Kenny's cruelty. He walked up to her, his eyes scanning her like an animal eyeing prey. He gripped her arm and jerked her toward him, forcing her into a cruel embrace.

"What’s wrong, Zaira?" he mocked, his hand trailing along her arm. "You like to play the good girl, huh? Let’s see how long that lasts."

Zaira recoiled in disgust, but Kenny wasn’t going to let go. He twisted her arm painfully, his fingers digging into her skin as he dragged her closer to Ali. Ali’s heart clenched. This wasn’t the girl he had come to admire, the girl who had been so kind to him. She was being broken before his eyes, and there was nothing he could do about it.

Ali, desperate and powerless tried to stand but the grip on him tightened. Kenny tore at his shirt, the fabric tearing as he pushed Ali back into his seat. "Let’s see how long you last before you break, huh?"

Kenny spat, his breath hot on Ali’s face.

"Please, Kenny, stop," Zaira begged, her voice full of panic, but it only fueled his anger.

"Shut up!" Kenny snapped. His fist slammed into Zaira’s stomach, sending her stumbling backward. Ali’s body trembled as he watched Zaira fall to the floor, her face pale and contorted in pain.

"You bastard!" Ali screamed, trying to break free. But Kenny's friends grabbed him harder keeping him pinned to the chair, his body trembling with fear and anger. He could hear Zaira's whimpering, her cries so soft, but they cut through him like a blade.

Kenny was relentless. His laughter filled the library as he loomed over Zaira, his eyes dark with lust and malice.

"You think you can talk back to me, bitch?" he spat.

With a brutal slap, he sent her crashing to the ground. Zaira cried out, but before she could recover, Kenny's friends held her down. Kenny stood over her, his eyes cold and cruel. Without warning, he ripped her shirt, his fingers digging into her skin as he violated her in front of Ali.

Ali screamed, his body convulsing as he tried to move, but the weight of Kenny’s friends kept him pinned to the floor.

"No!" Ali cried, tears streaming down his face as he begged, but Kenny laughed. He hit Zaira again, harder this time, then kissed her. The brutal scene was too much to bear, and Ali’s heart shattered as he watched Zaira endure it.

Kenny continued his torment, taunting Ali with every move. He took Ali’s belt and swung it viciously at him, the buckle cutting into his flesh. Each blow made Ali flinch, but the pain was nothing compared to the agony of seeing Zaira suffer.

"You’re nothing, Ali," Kenny sneered. "Just a weak little nobody."

"You’re just a toy, Zaira. Just like Ali. You think you’re special?"

He slapped her hard across the face, grabbed Ali's belt, the leather coiling in his fist as he whipped it across Zaira’s back with a sickening crack and then kissed her. Zaira screamed out in agony, her body jerking with each strike. The belt cut through the air leaving angry red welts on her skin. Kenny didn’t stop. He kissed her again, this time on the lips, a brutal forceful kiss and then proceeded to hit her again with the belt, the sound of leather against flesh filling the air.

Ali’s body trembled as he watched in horror. His chest tightened but there was nothing he could do. His mind screamed but his body betrayed him.

One of Kenny’s friends enjoying the chaos grabbed a large wooden stick from a nearby shelf. He shoved it roughly into Ali’s mouth forcing him to bite down on the wood, the sharp edges scraping against his teeth. Ali gagged, his eyes watering as the stick pressed deeper but it didn’t stop there. The other thug began to punch him, each hit landing with sickening force making Ali’s vision blur. The pain felt like fire but he couldn’t scream, couldn’t protest.

Meanwhile, Kenny still grinning like a madman grabbed the same stick from his friend, his eyes wild as he turned it on Zaira. He forced it into her mouth, her lips trembling as she struggled to breathe.

"Shut up, bitch," Kenny hissed, and then he too began to beat her with the stick, each strike more vicious than the last. The library filled with the sound of sickening thuds and Zaira’s desperate muffled cries.

Kenny’s sadistic grin never faltered as he hovered over Zaira. He began to unzip his pants, his intentions clear.

"You want this, don’t you, Zaira?" he taunted, his voice dripping with cruelty. He took a step forward ready to finish what he’d started, when someone started banging on the door from outside. It was Aiden, Ali's best friend.

He came to find Ali as he was gone for too long and suddenly heard Ali screaming. The door to the library slammed with each of Aiden's desperate bangs. The screams he had heard just moments ago, Ali’s anguished cries had torn through him like a blade. He knew something was wrong. He had to get in.

"Ali! Ali, are you okay?"

But the door remained unmoving, no answer coming from within. His mind raced. He couldn’t wait any longer. He had to find another way in. Then it hit him, the window. The window behind the library. It was a long shot but it was his only shot.

Aiden turned quickly and sprinted around the corner of the building. His eyes immediately locked on the narrow window. He rushed to it standing on his tiptoes.

What he saw made his blood run cold. The sight was worse than anything he could have ever imagined. The scene before him was something out of a nightmare. Kenny and his friends loomed over Ali, their faces twisted with sadistic pleasure. Ali was on the ground, bruised and broken, his shirt ripped and his body trembling.

But it wasn’t just Ali that tore at his soul. Zaira, who had once been the kind, gentle girl was now on the floor, her clothes torn, her face stained with tears. The horror of what she had endured was clear in her lifeless posture, her body a cruel mirror of everything that had just happened.

Aiden’s stomach churned, the sight unbearable. He nearly screamed but his body was frozen, caught in the horror of the moment. He raised his phone, his hands shaking violently and began recording.

"This is it, Kenny."

"I’m recording this, you sick bastards!"

Aiden’s voice was hoarse, furious, and broken all at once.

"I’m showing this to the police! You hear me? The police will know what you did!"

Inside, Kenny and his friends froze for a moment. The realization that Aiden had seen everything was like a slap to their faces. But they were too far gone in their own twisted satisfaction. They turned to each other, their anger bubbling to the surface. Without a word they made the decision to leave, their footsteps retreating slowly.

Finally, the door creaked open and Aiden burst inside slamming it shut behind him. The library felt like a tomb, suffocating and cold. Zaira’s faint, barely conscious form on the ground, Ali crumpled beside her, his body soaked with tears and blood.

He knelt beside Ali and carefully shook him awake, his heart breaking as he saw the devastation in his friend’s eyes. Ali looked up at him.

"Aiden…" Ali croaked, his voice raw. "She… she’s…" He couldn’t finish, his words breaking as fresh tears spilled from his eyes.

Aiden’s jaw clenched. He had never felt such intense anger before. He helped Ali sit up, his friend’s body trembling beneath his touch. Aiden glanced at Zaira, still lying unconscious, her body bruised and battered.

"Let’s get her to the hospital, Ali," Aiden said through gritted teeth.

"They’re not getting away with this."

Ali nodded slowly, his body still weak. They managed to get Zaira into a seated position, wrapping her in whatever clothes they could find. Aiden helped Ali to his feet, supporting him as they stumbled toward the door.

As they exited the library. It felt wrong. Everything felt wrong.

Once they arrived at the hospital, Aiden stayed close to Ali, who kept staring at the ground, lost in thought. He wasn’t sure how long they’d waited but it felt like hours. Time felt irrelevant in the face of such horror. Zaira was finally being treated, her body covered in bruises and marks and Ali couldn’t bear to look at her.

They sat outside the hospital room, their silence heavy with the weight of what had happened. Ali, his eyes bloodshot and swollen.

Aiden’s face softened, his own tears streaking down his face.
