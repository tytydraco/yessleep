It was a blur.

I remember being trapped, either I stay here and die by monsters, or jump off and die by monsters. 

I decided if I was gonna die, why don’t I die epically, so I jumped out of the window.

I felt my body hit the concrete road, as I anticipated being killed by the monsters down there, but no one came to kill me, instead it was my friends, Ernest, Ethan, and Aiden. Turned out my mind was playing tricks on me, I guess.

But it turned out they had to distract the monsters away from the area, and they’ll come back soon, and then I saw another horde of monsters coming our way, so we wasted no time, but ran for our lives.

Eventually we got stuck in the woods again, but it was better than staying at an abandoned town full to the brim with monsters, so we decided to settle here for the night.

But we had no resources. Everything we brought was still at the town, but that was already full with monsters, we didn’t want to risk it. All we got was some money and one tent, which Aiden decided to bring with him. So we decided to have one as lookout, like last time, and the rest sleeping in the tent. Ernest was traumatized from being on lookout a few hours ago, so he wanted to sleep to clear his head. Ethan was very tired, too, so he’d figured we shouldn’t have someone sleepy be on lookout, so he went inside the tent. That left me and Aiden, neither of us were tired so we both went on lookout, I mean, aren’t two heads better than one? 

 But we were both freezing, we wished we could have blankets like Ernest and Ethan, who were both sound asleep. So I decided to grab some wood and start a fire, while Aiden stayed back. I knew how to start a fire, as I always thought I would end up in a situation like this, and now was the time. So I set off. I went deep into the woods, trying to find some wood, and I did. It was a whole pile of it, so I grabbed it, I couldn’t believe my luck. So I walked back to camp, but I felt like someone was following me. I turned back.

I saw him, Tom. 

But I was just tired of Tom’s bullshit. So instead of screaming and being scared, I just continued walking back to camp, keeping an eye on Tom, still. But I noticed he was moving much faster, and as I saw him approach, I got a true look at Tom.

I always thought he was just a dark figure with glowing red eyes, but it was a lot more sinister than that, his mouth was taped shut, he barley had any skin left, just skeleton and blood, covering his face, with no hair. 

That made me run, faster, still trying to remain calm, as I ran back to camp, shouting at Ethan to alert the others while Tom was chasing me, but every second he got a little faster, until eventually my legs gave out, I tripped over a rock and hit my head hard on the ground, with it starting to bleed, I knew it was the end of me. Just as Tom grabbed me and opened his mouth to eat me, I suddenly noticed something.

“Run Jonathan! Run!” As Ethan came running towards me, and just as my head was entering Tom’s mouth, Ethan shoved his arm into Tom’s mouth, stopping him from killing me. 

But Tom bit Ethan’s arm off, I ran, and then I heard Ethan scream in pain, and he ended up getting eaten by that monster. And when Tom was satisfied, he left and reentered the woods. By then the sun was rising, and we haven’t found civilization yet, so our goal today was to find a town that had people living in it. So we continued walking away from the camp.

I did find a map, and we went from sad to enthusiastic, the nearest city, Richmond, was only 6 miles away! We knew we could get there before the day was over, this could also be our first night where we didn’t have to sleep in an abandoned town or the woods! So me, Ernest, and Aiden embarked on the route to Richmond.

Now, since the journey was long, it took hours of rest and walking to get there, and it got dark easily, but then I saw the city lights, those skyscrapers, life, cars, everything. I knew we finally achieved our first sign of progress.
