Lane county is where I was born and raised, It's a quant bit of Oregon. It's got Springfield, home of the Simpsons, Euegene, home of the worst drivers in the northwest, and little Fall Creek where the Hicks run free. My family has been here for generations. And in all that time we've had some wild stories. A crazy hunting trip, a motorcycle accident, Even a few pretty nasty arrests. But, nobody would have ever thought that I would be witness to something as awful as the body at FernRidge. 

Throughout the next few days my family and friends asked what I was doing out there, how they were sorry I had to find that poor soul and how they were glad it wasn't me.
I hadn't been sleep well since the incident and I woke up in a cold sweat with the sound of those crows in my ears. After a while when the story was finally posted in the paper, I learned who the poor soul was. His name was Jeffrey Sotherland, he had apparently been missing for three days. He went out for an evening run and never came home.

The coroner's report said it was a bear attack, but I've never heard of a bear mangling someone so viciously. It seemed like it was done with real unadulterated malice. I tried to get the thoughts out of my head, I dug deep into the local stories of the Lurker. Why? I don't know, maybe the thought of finding something kept me busy. Maybe I thought it would help me to think a real monster did that horrible act, or maybe I was just bored.

A few times I tried to calling Lizz, thinking maybe talking to someone who had an inkling of what I was going through would help. But I couldn't do it, I needed some time to think. As the days dragged on, I found a little news paper snippets on how there had been a couple dozen Sightings over the past few decades. I asked my older family who had lived in the region about it, they all scoffed and said it was a bunch of hogwash. However I did find a story about a woman who claims to have seen the Lurker up close.

With no other leads I drove to the outskirts of Eugene where the woman lived. I found her little home with a sign out front that said
“Evaline’s hut of the Occult.”
I took a deep breath and walked inside, it was a small wicken shop. There were crystals and incense and some strange talismans on the wall, as I walked in I heard an older woman's voice call out.
“be out in a minute, I'm just doing some inventory.”
Her voice sounded rough like she had been smoking her whole life. A few moments later a short woman in her mid to late forties with silvery hair walked out.

“ Hey there Deary, what can Evaline do for you? Are you looking for some new incense to calm some jagged nerves, or maybe a dream catcher to help you rest at night?”

I shook my head softly.
“no thank you ma’am, I actually had some questions for you.”

She looked at me some what confused.
“questions? About what?”

Her eyes narrowed.
“you a fed?”

“what? No! I'm a…..I'm a…”
My mind stuttered to find the right words, she gave me an inquisitive look.

“spit it out deary, i ain't gonna bite.”

I swallowed hard.
“I'm a Cryptozoologist, and I want to ask you about, the Lurker.”

Her somewhat joyous expression faltered and she looked at me intensely.
“ and why do you want to her about that?”

“I'm looking to prove it's existence, I want to know what's in those woods. And I want to know, why it's here.”

She rubbed her neck methodically, she motioned for me to follow her out back. We passed through boxes that smelled like spices and herbs. As we exited to her back porch she sat down in a rocking chair, motioning for me to sit in a lawn chair just across from her. She pulled out a long cigarette from a box in her coat pocket, she lite it and began to draw on it. The mounting silence was deafening, finally I sighed and said.

“ the lurker?”

“It's bad news, boy!”
She cut me off quickly.

“and you shouldn't go messing with it…”

I took a deep breath and continued.
“look I just want to know what you know about it, have you seen it or not?”

She smirked as she blew out a stream of thin grey smoke.
“yeah, I've seen it. It's the reason I'm here in this little shack of a house.”

I raised my eyebrows in confusion.
“what do you mean?”

“the Lurker,  is a forest spirit. As far as I can tell it came with the Danish settlers who founded Junction City.”

“that still doesn't answer my question.” 

She keeped Dragging on the cigarette, the ash slowly falling to the porch.
“it latches onto someone. Watches them and decides when it's time to take them to the forest, but it needs earth, soil, it needs its forest. Here just inside the city I'm safe…”

“your still not making any sense?” 

She sighed loudly, putting the burnt Cigarette remains in the ash try next to her.
“ when I was about twelve years old, my dad was a logger. He went and worked in the trees on the hills all up and down the county, one day he didn't come home. His Foreman told my mom that he went to grab some equipment at the truck and never came back.”

She leaned back in her chair looking at the skyline.
“the police searched for days, but the forest is thick. Finally after a week they found him, or what was left of him. His body had been torn to pieces, all that was left was mangled bones. The only way they could identify him was his work vest.”

She placed her hand to her mouth fighting back tears, I sat there giving her all the time she needed. She looked back at me her voice wavering. 

“later that week my mother wanted to, scatter his ashes at FernRidge lake, he liked to fish there on the weekends. As we scattered the ashes, I looked across the lake and saw this tree moving strangely and from a crook in its branches I saw two gleaming eyes like…”

“Burning coals?”
I blurted out. She looked at me solemnly and nodded.

“I tried to tell my mother but by the time I did the tree, or whatever it was, was gone. Like it was never there to begin with. All that was there was a murder of crows, flying deeper into the woods.”

I recoiled slightly at the memory of the crows returning to me, she continued not seeming to notice my reaction. 
“that night as I went to bed at our little farm house, a storm was brewing the wind was tearing through the trees. I couldn't sleep, and when I looked out the window. I saw a tree, that wasn't there before. Right outside my window, I went to inspect it and as I did I heard the loud sound of wood cracking and popping like a tree fall. Then…”

She started to stammer the thought apparently so much to take. She continued her voice a low whisper coursing with visceral dread.

“ I say the Eyes…. Two burning coals just outside my window, then the sound….the sound was like the sound of a dying Elk…the next thing a knew a tangle of branches was flying through the window, glass flying everywhere and my mother screaming…”

She faltered again.

“what happened next?” I asked my morbid curiosity getting the better of me.

She sniffed and spoke in a quivering voice.
“ When I woke up our house was destroyed, my mother was able to get us into the cellar. She looked like she had been through hell, we packed what little we had and moved here to my aunt's house. My mother wouldn't talk about that night, she said it was to much to bear. Then after we had settled in, I saw the eyes again right there…”

She pointed across the street. 
“It never got any closer than that, it was then I realized that the Cities are safe…safe from what ever that thing is…and I've never left this house since….”

She trailed off her eyes red from fighting the tears. I waited for her to compose herself, she turned to me and in a shaky voice she said.
“ quit while you are ahead kid, this thing is an animal, and we are encroaching on its turf.”

I looked at her softly and said
“ thank you for sharing but I think the world deserves to know what's out there.” 
I motioned to the hills and forest of the skyline.

She shook her head slowly.
“ Nobody needs to know what's out there, it just wants to be left alone, just stop pushing…or something bad will happen to you.”

I smiled at her and said calmly.
“thanks, but I'm willing to take the risk.”

She shook her head softly and sighed.
“well I can't stop you, but take this.”
She reached up behind her neck and pulled up a small pendant, it was a strange silver “V” shape with two small lines pointing down at the bottom and in the middle was a red stone set in the shape of an eye.

“What is it? I asked inquisitively.”

She smiled at me and said.
“ It's my Mala’dreug, my Evil Eye…it's to ward off foul spirits…I have two..and I would feel better knowing you have one.”

I took the pendant from her and laced it around my neck.
“ thank you Evaline.”

She shook her head.
“don't thank me, just promise me that if you find that thing. You’ll get as far away as possible.” 

I nodded and got up to leave.

“Wait!” she spouted abruptly.

“I have one more thing for you.” She shuffled back into the house and came out with a Manila envelope. She handed to me and said softly.
“my mother drew that the day after we moved in….”

I opened the envelope and gasped at the sight of the drawing, it was a crude depiction of what looked like a tree with its trunk forming the body of an Elk. with huge pale sunk in eyes that seemed to burn right to my core.
“ I will take good care of this, thanks again.”

She nodded somberly and motioned me to the door. As I left her house and slowly made my way to my car, I had the strange feeling that I was being watched. I looked up at the phone wires above my head and saw a large crow sitting there watching me intently. I shuddered and walked a little faster glancing up at it every few steps, its eyes never leaving me. As I got into my car and shut the door it flew down and suddenly landed on my hood. Its black eyes bored a hole into my soul. And I swear for a moment it's eyes flashed orange. It squawked angrily and flew off my car towards the hills. I sat there pondering why I felt so on edge. Then it hit me, the birds eyes flashed orange, like two burning coals.
