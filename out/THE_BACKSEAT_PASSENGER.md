It was the summer of 2017, and I was making good money driving for one of those ride-share apps. Nights were my prime time. People needed rides from bars, airports, or just late-night shifts. I liked the quiet hum of the engine, the solitude, and the occasional interesting conversation. Most nights, it was just me and the endless ribbons of highway. But one night, on a stretch of road I’d driven a thousand times, that quiet hum turned into a slow, suffocating dread.

It started like any other fare. A ping came in around 2 AM for a pickup way out on the edge of town, near the old industrial park. The kind of place where streetlights are sparse and the wind whistles through empty warehouses. The app showed the passenger's name as "Anonymous" and their picture was just a black silhouette. Not unheard of, but it always made me a little antsy. Still, a fare's a fare.

I pulled up to the pin, a dark, desolate corner with a lone, flickering streetlamp. A figure emerged from the deeper shadows. He was tall, thin, and wore a wide-brimmed hat pulled low, obscuring his face. His coat, even in the humid summer night, seemed too heavy, too dark. He opened the back passenger door without a word and slid in. The air in my car suddenly felt heavy, charged. I glanced in the rearview mirror. His face was still hidden by the hat, but I could make out the glint of something in his hand. My stomach clenched. Just a phone, I told myself. Or maybe a wallet. Just a phone.

"Where to?" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. The app hadn't provided a destination. Another red flag.

A low, guttural voice, like gravel being dragged across concrete, rumbled from the backseat. "Just drive. I'll tell you when to turn."

My heart hammered against my ribs. This was wrong. All wrong. Every instinct screamed at me to hit the gas and leave him on that dark corner, but something rooted me to the spot. Fear, I guess. The kind of fear that paralyzes you. I put the car in drive and eased away from the curb.

We drove in silence for a long time. The city lights faded behind us, replaced by the oppressive blackness of the rural highway. Every minute felt like an hour. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, occasionally darting glances into the rearview mirror. He was always there, unmoving, a dark silhouette against the barely lit interior of my car. I could feel his eyes on the back of my head, a pressure that made the hairs on my neck stand up.

"Left here," he said, his voice cutting through the silence like a rusty blade.

I turned onto a narrow, unpaved road, barely wide enough for one car. Trees pressed in on either side, their branches clawing at the sky, forming a tunnel of darkness. The only light was from my headlights, carving a path through the oppressive gloom. My phone was on the passenger seat, the app still open, but the map was just a grey void out here. No GPS signal. No way to call for help.

"Keep going," he instructed, his voice flat, devoid of any discernible emotion.

The road grew rougher, the car bouncing and rattling over potholes. The smell of damp earth and decay began to fill the air, a cloying sweetness that made my throat clench. I gripped the steering wheel so hard my knuckles ached. My palms were slick with sweat.
Then, I heard it. A faint scraping sound from the backseat. It was subtle at first, barely noticeable above the hum of the engine and the crunch of gravel under the tires. But it grew steadily louder, a rhythmic scrape-scrape-scrape.

I risked another glance in the rearview mirror. He was still there, hat low, utterly still. But the sound continued. It wasn't coming from him, not directly. It was coming from beneath his coat. My breath hitched.

The scraping stopped abruptly.

A moment later, I heard a wet, slurping sound. My stomach churned. I tried to swallow, but my mouth was dry. I couldn't bring myself to look again. I focused on the road, on the faint glow of my headlights, willing the darkness to disappear.
"Stop here," he said, his voice closer now, as if he had leaned forward.

I slammed on the brakes. The car skidded to a halt, kicking up a cloud of dust. We were in a small clearing, surrounded by dense woods. The air was thick with the scent of pine and something else… something metallic, coppery.

The back door opened. A wave of cold air washed over me, even though it was summer. I heard the crunch of footsteps on gravel as he got out. I didn't dare turn my head. I stared straight ahead, at the dark abyss of the woods, my heart a trapped bird in my chest.

Then, through the rearview mirror, I saw him. He was standing beside the open back door, facing into the darkness of the clearing. He had taken off his hat.
And that's when I saw it. Or rather, when I understood the scraping sound.

His head was elongated, bulbous, disproportionately large for his thin frame. His skin was a sickly grey, stretched taut over prominent bones. But it was his face that truly made my blood run cold. Where eyes should have been, there were only two deep, empty sockets, like black holes staring into nothing. And his mouth… his mouth was too wide, stretching almost to his ears, filled with rows of needle-sharp teeth, slick with something dark and viscous. The scraping, the slurping… it clicked into place with horrifying clarity.
He was holding something. A small, furred animal, limp in his hand. Its head was torn away. The dark, viscous fluid was blood.

He turned his head slowly, and even without eyes, I felt his gaze. It was a pressure, a cold, predatory intelligence that seemed to pierce through the back of my skull. He raised the mangled creature to his mouth and took another bite. The wet tearing sound echoed in the silent clearing.

I don't know what happened next. Panic, pure and unadulterated, took over. My hands were shaking so violently I could barely grip the wheel. I fumbled with the gear shift, slammed it into reverse, and floored the accelerator. The tires spun, spraying gravel, before finally catching.

The car shot backward, narrowly missing a tree. I wrenched the wheel, turning the car around, and sped back down the treacherous dirt road, leaving him there, in the darkness, with his gruesome meal. I didn't look back. I couldn't.

I drove like a madman, the image of that monstrous face burned into my mind. I didn't stop until I reached the highway, until I saw the first distant glow of streetlights, until I knew I was truly out of that place. I pulled over to the side of the road, trembling, and threw up everything I had eaten that day.

I never drove for that app again. I couldn't. Every late-night drive, every darkened road, every glance into the rearview mirror brought that image back, the eyeless sockets, the too-wide mouth, the wet tearing sound.

Sometimes, late at night, when the house is quiet and the wind howls just right, I hear it. A faint scrape-scrape-scrape. And I wonder if he’s still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for another ride. Or perhaps, just perhaps, he’s found a way to ride along, unseen, in the backseats of other unsuspecting drivers, just waiting for the right moment to ask them to turn down a dark, forgotten road. The kind of road where no one can hear you scream.
