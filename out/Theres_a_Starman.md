My best friend was an astronaut.

Not just any astronaut, the youngest one ever to have gone up into space. He was 17 when he went up. Wait, why am I explaining this? I'm sure you've all heard about Ellis Clyde. 'Ace', as he went by. Anyway, Ace went up at 17, and he came down at 17. 

He'll stay 17 forever. 

'Tragedy in the Stars'. That's what the *Times* said. 'Our country is greatly saddened to see the loss of young Ellis Clyde, better known to us as Ace.' 'Ace's funeral will take place this Wednesday. All are welcome.' 

Everyone knows about his death. Some error in his suit on his third spacewalk. 

They gave me his diary. Wait, they don't call it that up there. His log? Whatever. Seemed like a lot of the stuff in there was for me, or stuff that he wanted to tell me anyway, although I bet NASA already made a hundred copies. He tried to draw the sun rising over the earth, but he never was a good artist. Still, he tried. That has to count for something.

Anyway. His funeral was a week ago. Lots of stuffy old people, lots of people crying, lots of cameras. Ell would have hated it. He used to tell me that if his funeral didn't have a piñata with his favorite candies, he wasn't showing up.

I got home after the funeral, ready to just go to bed. Too many people. Too many people pretending to care. I can't remember how many pictures I had to take with politicians looking sad for some kid that they didn't even know. 

I had grabbed something to eat and then sat down on the couch, when the doorbell rang. I went to answer, and

It. Was. Ellis. 

Without a doubt. 

Leaning against the post, wearing his favorite hoodie, black with a gold star in the middle. 

"Hey, what's up?" He asked, holding out his fist for a fist bump. I didn't respond. He laughs, scratching the back of his head. "Sorry it took me so long to get here, it takes a while to get back from-"

"Twenty two hours. Give or take. Not counting all the extra stuff."

"Yeah."

We stood there another minute. His eyes flicked over my attire, lips starting to form a question before he brushed it off. "So, uh, can I come in? I'm starving. And I didn't actually think you'd be here, I was just gonna let myself in and wait in your room for you to get back from school."

"Yeah- sure. Come on in." I stepped aside, and he bounced in, light as ever. We always joked that he would make a good astronaut because it seemed like he was lighter than everyone else- always bouncing, always on his toes. Even his hair seemed to defy gravity, flipping up at the ends. He didn't style it, it just did that. 

"Ugh, real food! Yessss." He was digging through our pantry already. I sat back on the couch, trying to process it. He was dead. They pulled his body in from space. I had just come from his FUNERAL, for crying out loud! He skipped into the living room, arms loaded with chips, cookies, and whatever other junk food crap he found in our kitchen. He had an Oreo clamped in his mouth, and as he dumped the rest of the snacks he found on the table, he took a bite and pulled out the other half. "So, Chlo-" He started through a mouthful of food. "Why are you dressed like that?" 

"I was just at your funeral."

Ridiculously, his face lit up. "Oh, wicked! How was the piñata?"

"There was no piñata. Just politicians."

He frowned. "Terrible trade, that."

"How are you here?" I demanded. "You died in space."

"Oh, yeah. I was murrrddeerrreddd." He says, clawing his hands, before snorting and cracking up. "Kidding, kidding! Oh, Chloe, you should have seen your face! Ugh! Priceless." He goes back to eating his food. "Anyway. Don't know why I'm here. Probably something wrong. Don't know what, though."

"Everything. You're dead, and everyone's pretending to care." He stops mid-bite, looking at me. 

"Are you pretending too?" He asked, his voice small. I shook my head. He let out a sigh of relief and went back to eating. I stared at him. 

"You're not surprised?" He shrugs. 

"About what?"

"You being dead?"

"Knew that. Space is cold, by the way, don't recommend it, especially for someone who's already cold all the time like you."

"People not caring?"

"The important people do. That's how it always was, Chlo. I was famous because I was the youngest astronaut. An ideal, a figurehead. Not really a *person*. And I'll drift into oblivion as soon as a younger person goes up. Maybe I'll be a Jeopardy! question someday. That'd be cool. Anyways, it doesn't bug me, because that doesn't matter to the people that *actually* matter, like you, and my parents, and the rest of our friends."

I don't say anything for a minute, thinking that over. He tilts his head. "What'cha thinking about?"

"There won't be a younger person. The countries are all getting together to promise that. Your death was too much of a tragedy. No one wants to lose any more 'promising young lives' to the void."

He scrunches up his nose. "That sounds dumb. Space is beautiful. A suit malfunction shouldn't stop anyone from seeing it."

"So you're sure it was a suit malfunction?"

He nods. "Yeah. Teeny-tiny hole in the air supply. It all drained out before we noticed, and then by the time we did I was already passing out. I have a gap in my memory then, but I saw them hauling me in."

"That sounds awful."

"Eh. Worse ways to go. Anywhozel, how are you, Chloe?"

"Whatever. Fine as I can be." I sigh. I hear the garage door opening. *Mom must be back early.* I glance over to see it's already sunset. *Or not.* "Wow. Time really flew by, huh Elli- Ellis?"

He was gone. Just a pile of junk food on the table to show he'd been there at all.

I had no clue what had happened. Mom walked in a few moments later, raising an eyebrow at the unholy amount of junk on the table. "What happened here?" 

"Ell- I don't know." I answered. "I'll put it away."

I didn't really see any more of Ellis until Saturday, except a few glimpses I thought I'd caught of him- in the halls at school when I went back on Friday, at the park as I walked back home, in the corner of my room at night, grinning in a decidedly unsettling manner. That last one way creeped me out, actually. On Saturday, though, while I was sitting by myself, listening to music, he popped into my field of vision, waving cheerfully at me. I pulled my headphones down, raising my eyebrows at him. 

"Was that you in my room last night?" I hissed at him.

"Yeah. Why?"

"Dude, don't ever do that again, that was creepy. Creepier than whatever this is." I gestured to him. He put a hand to his chest, pretending to be hurt.

"I'm not creepy. And I'm sorry that I scared you."

"You scared the crap out of me. You were grinning at me all weird."

"Was I? Huh."

"What are you doing here?"

"I dunno. Again, I really don't know why I'm still here. It's weird, right? It's been like a month since I died."

"Yeah...why *are* you still here?" I ask, more to myself than him, although he gives a very helpful and elucidating shrug. "There has to be a reason..."

"Maybe there isn't one. Maybe it's just to see you and everyone else before I go."

"Maybe..." I mutter. He leans his head into my shoulder and gives me his stupid puppy-dog eyes. 

"What, is it so unbelievable that I'd want my last memory of being on earth to be of your lovely face? What if I have a crush on you, huh? What if I'm supposed to stick around until I admit it?"

"I've read your diary, stupid, I know you like Marie."

He frowns playfully. "Don't ruin the illusion."

"Whatever, dork."

"That kinda sounds like an invasion of my privacy, no? Reading my diary?"

"*Everything* was free game once you died, dude. Me and Peter are fighting over your hoodie."

"No respect for the dead, huh? Maybe that's why I'm here." He gives me his lopsided smirk. "Tell Peter to let you have it."

"Already tried."

"You told him you saw me?"

"No. What, you think I want to go to the loony bin? There's a good chance that the reason you're here is because I'm hallucinating you from grief or something." He shrugs. 

"True, but I doubt it. I *feel* real enough."

I just shrugged him off. "I'm going to bed. Stay out of my room."

I glanced back at him, raising my eyebrows to emphasize my point, then froze. He was grinning at me weird again. "Whatever you say, Chloe." He said, his voice echoing strangely in the room, and then vanished, leaving behind a cold spot. I shivered, rubbing my arms to warm them up.

On Tuesday, I had the idea that maybe he was still here because of the funeral. No piñata like he wanted, no bright colors, no dance party. He had a weird idea of what a funeral should look like. I got our friend group together and told them about it (without mentioning Ellis- don't want to sound crazy), and they all agreed to it. So we met up yesterday, a week after his funeral, all dressed in bright colors, blasting *Party Rock*, swinging at a piñata, laughing and gorging ourselves on Snickers, his favorite candy, right at his grave. Maybe a tad disrespectful to anyone else in the graves, but he would have wanted it.

Maybe it worked, because I haven't thought I've seen him since. It hasn't been 24 hours, yet, so he might show up later and it will have been for nothing. But I don't know. Even if he's still stuck, at least we followed his wishes. That's something he would have wanted, right?
