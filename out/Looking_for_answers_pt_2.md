Day 7

I am absolutely obsessed. If I had bothered to learn more about her writing, I would’ve been her biggest fan. Her latest story is her best so far. I haven’t been able to stop listening since I started. Call it bias, call it love, call it whatever you want. My wife was, is, one of the best authors of our lifetimes. The only thing is I can’t shake the feeling that there is something in her words. The officers mentioned that there might be a clue to her whereabouts and that has stayed in the back of my mind. I just can’t figure it out. 

In I.T. There is a practice of keeping a rubber duck on your desk. When you run into an issue you can’t fix, sometimes explaining the issue to the duck can help. I’m hoping you can be my rubber duck. I’ve been transcribing my wife’s audio notes as best I can. Fair warning, she recorded on her phone so all I can make out are her words and the occasional nature sounds. For the sake of ease, assume that anything quoted is her thoughts unless said otherwise. 

“Tuesday. It’s a cool morning. Can’t be more than 55. The park seems to be pretty empty this morning. I guess the tourists have left and hunters haven’t moved in yet. All the better. The last thing I need is to have to give someone directions or dodge the amateur nature photographers. [Bird Calls] The reds and orange of the trees do what they do every year. Even the most obtuse traveler could see that fall is upon us and soon the thickness of these mountains will more closely resemble a dried coral bed. The trees with all of their knotted limbs stretching and twis… [animal cries]. I think something might be hurt out there. Someone is stocking up to hibernate. 

As I come upon Cades Cove, the peace envelops me. I’ve always meant to look into what this place really means. There’s a history here and they tried to teach me in grade school. If this is to be my setting, I’ll need to figure that out. 

As I top the hill, I can’t help but miss the azaleas bloom. The colors in the meadow felt like an ethereal painting made just for me. Maybe next year I’ll try a water… [animal cries] that poor thing. I wish someone would just finish it off. Death is natural but suffering never fails to hurt. I should turn back. Maybe when I get back Josh will be ready to talk. God knows that we need to.”

Day 8

Apologies for the break. I’ve never been great at dictation, so there’s a lot of editing I have to do. I’m trying my best to make sure that what she said gets written down right. If nothing else, I feel like she would want her thoughts written down. 

“Thursday. Another cool day. Little windy. Rain is moving in. For safeties sake, I tried to find the hunting season start date. Turns out there is no hunting allowed. I’ll have to keep note of anything to report to the rangers. 

The creek along Twenty Mile trail is a little low. Hopefully tonight’s storm can fix it. I think today I will continue onto Lost Cove. Who knows what Fontana looks like this time of year. The water has always been comforting. The noise of the creek takes me back. As a kid on my mother’s land, playing in the creek and doing things that would get people arrested today. It’s a shame that our kid won’t get to experience that freedom. Shit, I need to tell Josh. Who knows, maybe a baby can fix a relationship. 

Breaking away from the creek. The immediate silence never ceases to amaze me. The thick underbrush creates a barrier, unmatched by anything made by man. There’s a deepness to it. I can’t explain it but it’s like the trees have a secret. A secret known only to those original to this land. I’ve heard the stories but never bought onto anythi…. [whistling in distance]. I think someone is near. It’s not unheard of that people will hike out here but there were no cars. I’m not superstitious but even I know better than to do anything like that out here. 

As I crossed the AT I almost ran into a hiker. He seemed sweet enough, if not a bit smelly. I jokingly shared with him the locals warnings of whistling and he laughed then continued on. I’ve always thought a Thru-hike would be a great adventure, but Josh would never. 

The howling of the wind through the treetops is only broken by the snapping sticks of squirrels and other rodents stockpiling. They chatter and play through the trees, attempting to take part in the oldest of practices. Next year there will be plenty of Kits to wow the spring travelers. Fontana seems awfully still. I guess this is what they call the calm before the storm. Unlike the creek, the only sound is the lapping of the water on the bank. That and the occasional bicycle flying past. I’ve never spent as much time as I’d like here. The woods have never been a recommended area for a solo female, and Josh tells me every day to take a gun, but I’ve always felt at home here. [mans voice] What was that? [Do any fishing?] No I’m not a fisher. [Real shame. Great waters today]. Yeah I appreciate it. 

Some of these people are too friendly. Why would I be out here without a pole if I came to fish. Thankfully the nice ones leave you alone pretty quickly. Maybe I should carry something with me. Who knows how nice the next guy will be. 

On my way back I heard another animal. It sounded awfully similar to the last one. Must be a bad year for the foxes. It sounds so hurt. I know better than to go help but it sounds so sad.”
