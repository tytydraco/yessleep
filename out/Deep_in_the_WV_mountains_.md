In the remote mountains of West Virginia, there lived a young girl named Lily. She resided in a quaint, rustic cabin with her grandmother, Nana Rose, who had raised her since she was a baby. Their lives were simple, but filled with love and warmth. However, there was a secret that Lily's grandmother had been keeping from her, a secret that would change everything.

Nana Rose was a wise and gentle woman, with a mysterious past that she had always kept hidden from Lily. She had always told her that she was an orphan, with no family to speak of. But as Lily's 17th birthday approached, Nana Rose knew that she could no longer keep the truth from her.

The mountains around them were old and wise, and held secrets of their own. They were home to a creature, a creature that had been living in the shadows for centuries. It was a creature of legend, a creature that was said to bring both fortune and misfortune to those who encountered it. And Nana Rose had encountered it, many years ago.

As a young woman, Nana Rose had been out in the woods, gathering firewood, when she came across the creature. It was a tall, dark figure, with glowing eyes that seemed to pierce through the darkness. She was frightened, but there was something about the creature that drew her in, something that made her feel safe.

The creature spoke to her, in a voice that was both soft and commanding. It told her that she was special, that she had a gift that few possessed. It told her that she could see things that others could not, that she could communicate with the dead. And it told her that she had a responsibility, a responsibility to use her gift to help those in need.

Nana Rose was skeptical at first, but as she began to explore her gift, she realized that it was real. She could see things, things that others could not. She could communicate with the dead, and she could help them find peace. And so, she began to use her gift, to help those in need.

But as time went on, Nana Rose realized that her gift was not without its dangers. The creature that had given her the gift was not what it seemed. It was a dark and malevolent force, that sought to control her, to use her for its own purposes. And so, she fled, taking Lily with her, to the safety of the mountains.

As Lily's 17th birthday approached, Nana Rose knew that she could no longer keep the truth from her. She gathered Lily in her arms, and told her the story of the creature, and of her gift. She told her of the dangers that came with the gift, and of the responsibility that she now had.

Lily was frightened, but there was something about the story that resonated with her. She had always felt different, set apart from others. And as she listened to Nana Rose, she realized that she too had the gift. She too could see things, things that others could not.

Together, Lily and Nana Rose set out to use Lily's gift, to help those in need. They traveled the mountains, helping the lost and the lonely, the sick and the dying. And in doing so, they discovered a strength and a purpose that they had never known before.

But the creature was still out there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its chance to strike. And as Lily's gift grew stronger, so too did the creature's hold on her. It was a battle of wills, a battle that would test the limits of Lily's courage and her love for her grandmother.

In the end, Lily was able to break the creature's hold on her, and she and Nana Rose were able to live in peace, in the safety of the mountains. They continued to use their gift, to help those in need, and they were happy.

But they never forgot the creature, and the lesson that it had taught them. That with great power comes great responsibility, and that the greatest gift of all is love.
