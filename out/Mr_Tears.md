I’m writing this because people keep telling me I need to “talk about it.”
But there are some things you shouldn’t talk about—things that grow sharper, louder, hungrier when you say their name aloud.

Still… if I don’t say something, someone else will hear that knock one night. Someone else will open the door the way I did. Someone else will let him in.

I used to tell myself my husband, Mark, died peacefully. A heart attack in the middle of the night. He didn’t suffer, they said. I tried to believe it. For months I clutched that lie like a child clutching a blanket, pretending the house wasn’t colder, quieter, and emptier than before. Pretending the shadows didn’t stretch a little too far across the floorboards at dusk. Pretending grief wasn’t chewing me from the inside out like a nest of worms.

It started with the crying.

Not mine.

Someone else’s.

At first I thought the sound came from the pipes, old metal groaning with age. But soon the thin, watery sobbing pulsed from the walls, from the window frames, from the vents. Soft at first—too soft to be human, too soft to be anything natural.

Then louder.

Then closer.

And I wasn’t the only one who heard it.

My dog, Clover, refused to go near the hallway where the sound seemed strongest. She bristled, tail tucked, and barked at nothing—at empty air. At darkness.

One night, the sobbing grew so loud I pressed my hands over my ears. It didn’t help. It felt like the crying was inside my skull. A single long, agonized wail.

Then silence.

A moment later—

Knock, knock, knock.

Three soft taps on the front door.

The kind of knock a polite stranger might make.

The kind of knock a friend would give before asking, “Are you doing okay?”

I froze halfway down the stairs. No one visited me anymore unless it was a meal drop-off or a pity call. And no one came this late at night.

Clover whimpered and backed into the living room.

Another knock.
Gentle.
Rhythmic.
Almost… apologetic.

I should have ignored it. Should have turned off the lights, hidden in the bedroom, and pretended I wasn’t home.

But grief makes you stupid.
Loneliness makes you reckless.
Being broken makes you curious about every kind touch, even if it comes from something with claws.

I opened the door.

And there he was.

A man—no, not a man—standing on my porch. Tall. Thin. Too thin, like he was made of wire wrapped in paper. Almost seven feet, hunched slightly as if trying to appear smaller, less threatening. He wore a black coat that hung off him like wet cloth, sleeves too long, frayed at the cuffs.

But the first thing I noticed was the lack of a mouth.

His face was pale, stretched, empty where a mouth should have been. Just smooth skin from cheek to chin, as if someone had erased his lips with a trembling hand.

And above that smooth, silent face was a single eye.

One enormous, round eye that took up nearly half his face.

An eye that wept constantly.

Clear tears poured down his cheekbones, dripping off his jaw, splashing onto my welcome mat. His shoulders trembled with each silent sob.

He lifted one long, thin hand and pointed at me.

Then he pointed behind me—toward my house.

And finally, he placed that hand over where his heart should be.

I slammed the door.

For several seconds I pressed my back against it, panting. Clover growled low. I could hear him—whatever he was—shifting on the porch, not walking away, just… waiting.

I didn’t sleep that night.
But the crying stopped.

The next morning, I convinced myself it was a hallucination. Stress, grief, exhaustion—my mind taking shapes from pain and giving them faces.

But then the creatures came.

They weren’t monsters at first.

They were stains.

Dark, wet blotches spreading across the ceiling corners, pulsing slightly like they were breathing. I scrubbed at them but they grew back faster. Clover barked at them until she was hoarse.

Then they moved.

Slowly at first, crawling down the walls like thick black mold. When they reached the floor, they began to gather—small shapes less than a foot tall, writhing like piles of worms made of shadow and grief.

If you looked at them too long, you felt a horrible pulling sensation in your stomach, like they were sucking warmth out of your core.

Then they began whispering.

At night they clustered around my bed, whispering in voices that sounded like Mark. Not Mark alive, but Mark dying.

“Why didn’t you save me?”
“Why didn’t you wake up sooner?”
“Why are you still here?”

I covered my ears. The voices only grew louder.

I tried leaving the house, but something always drew me back. Keys vanished. Roads twisted. My phone would turn off every time I tried calling someone. And every night, at exactly 3:11 a.m., a soft knock echoed at the front door.

Mr. Tears wanted to come in.

One night, I broke.

I couldn’t take the whispers, the moving stains, the crushing cold of grief feeding on itself. I threw open the door.

He stood waiting, trembling with sobs, his long fingers pressed to the side of my house as if he had been listening.

His single eye locked on mine.

Then he stepped in.

His presence didn’t feel evil.
It felt tragic.
Like standing next to someone mourning the whole world.

His eye wept harder as he moved through my living room, dripping tears onto the hardwood floor. Everywhere his tears landed, the shadows receded. The stains shriveled. The whispering creatures hissed and retreated under furniture like bugs fleeing light.

I thought he was helping me.

I thought he had come because he pitied me.

I was wrong.

When the last creature vanished into the walls, he turned to me. His eye blinked once—slow, heavy.

He raised his hands and cupped my face gently, almost lovingly.

And suddenly—

I saw everything.

Not with my eyes, but in my mind. Memories that weren’t mine. A tiny apartment filled with yelling. A young boy crying alone in a dark room. A man—his father—screaming that tears make you weak. A mother turning her back. A childhood spent swallowing grief until it rotted inside him like poison.

A teenager experimenting with chemicals, breaking open valves from cleaning supplies, mixing things in jars in an abandoned shed.

A young man—skinny, ignored, lonely—learning how fumes can warp flesh, how tears and acid react, how pressure builds until it destroys. Learning how to hurt himself so he could hurt others first.

Then a night of fire.
A home explosion.
And a body, disfigured beyond being called human.

He wasn’t born a monster.

He made himself one.

Or maybe grief made him.

Suddenly his grip on my face tightened. His eye burned hot against my skin.

He didn’t feed on grief.

He cultivated it.

He grew it in people like mold. Made it worse until the creatures—the parasitic things he’d created or attracted—had enough to feast on.

His tears weren’t sadness.

They were acid.

They dripped onto my cheeks and burned like fire.

I screamed and shoved him away. Clover lunged, barking, snapping at his legs. Mr. Tears stumbled backward, his long limbs awkward, his coat soaked with corrosive tears that hissed when they hit the floor.

He wasn’t invincible.

He was still part human.

I grabbed the only thing within reach—a heavy iron fireplace poker—and swung with everything I had.

It connected with his skull.

He collapsed, twitching, sobbing soundlessly. His tears pooled under him, eating at the wood floor. He reached a hand toward me, shaking, almost pleading.

For a moment, I hesitated.

Then I brought the poker down again.

And again.

And again.

Until his single eye burst like a blister.

The tear-creatures screamed from within the walls—high, thin shrieks—and dissolved into smoke.

When it was over, Mr. Tears lay still.

I dragged what was left of him outside. The body felt lighter than it should have, like it was hollow. Like grief had eaten him from the inside out long before I ever met him.

I buried him at the edge of the woods behind my house.

The crying stopped.

The stains vanished.

The whispers quieted.

For the first time in months, I slept.

Almost a year passed before I heard that sound again.

Not crying.

Knock, knock, knock.

Three soft taps on the door.

I froze. Clover growled, old now, weaker but still protective.

I opened the door an inch.

A small boy stood there, maybe eight years old. Dirt on his clothes. Mud on his shoes. Tear tracks down his cheeks.

He held something in his hands.

A coat.

Long. Black. Wet.

When he lifted his head, his eyes—both of them—were red and swollen from crying.

He didn’t say a word.

He didn’t need to.

“It wasn’t him,” the boy whispered finally, voice trembling. “It was our father. He… he made us. Both of us.”

I stared at him, horror crawling up my spine.

The boy took a shaky step forward.

“He’s still alive,” he whispered. “And he wants the coat back.”

Behind him, deeper in the woods, something tall moved between the trees.

Something crying.

Something with more than one eye this time.

Something that had found a new way to grow.

I closed the door.

But I know it won’t hold.

Not forever.

Because grief finds its way in.
Because pain always knocks again.
Because Mr. Tears wasn’t the first.

And he won’t be the last.
