a couple of years ago, my wife Laura, decided to find some hustles and small jobs she could do for some money, we were starting to get tight on money around this time, and it was usually a struggle to afford all the things we needed, it got to the point where we'd have some days where we'd starve ourselves to sleep.


i was pretty happy she started to do these jobs, it started with the usual, babysitting, dog-walking, and other similar jobs.


one day, she got a message on Facebook from a now deleted account, it had came from the Sanders family in Pennsylvania, they had told her they had a "small" job for her, where she would babysit their kids, and do some other things such as cleaning, cooking food etc.. this meant she couldn't really come back home at all, she was there for almost 2 years, every couple of weeks, I'd get a video of her telling me updates about the family, and what they have been doing, how much she earned, etc.. 

but, something weird is going on, it had been 5 months since she had last sent a video, with the last one being of her, telling me that the job will end soon and that she could come back home very soon.


i wanted to see what's up, so i started the drive to the Sanders Home, when i got there, it was relatively big, pretty big indeed you could say it could fit an entire extended family of 50+ People.


i went up to their gate, and it was locked, so i tried to find a way to get into their home, i went from  the back, and when i entered their back-yard, i started going up to their front door, i knocked, no response, knocked again, but louder, no response, so i looked up to look at the windows, and i noticed, most of the windows were either broken or boarded up, i thought to myself "i must have gotten the wrong address, this house looks like it's been abandoned for 10 years", but i double-checked, and to my surprise, the address was correct, i decided to jump through one of the broken windows into the kitchen.


after jumping in, barely saving myself from getting a million cuts from broken glass, i looked at the table, the table had plates in it, and they had this weird substance in them, it looked fresh and recent, obvious by its moisture, before i noticed a cockroach inside one of the plates, i immediately jumped back in disgust, but, that wasn't the only weird thing in this place, the chairs, they had what i could only assume was an outline of blood, an outline, of a person.., and it was still wet, meaning this had to have happened during the last couple of hours, the thing that creeped me out a lot, was this thing, it was a black substance, it resembled the thing in the food, only was it much darker and had the texture of a dozen wires, it stretched across the walls of the kitchen, into the living room, and other ares of the house, this substance was also in the microwave, fridge, etc.. which freaked me tf out, but i continued to go, because i knew i had one, and only one objective, once i finished it, i could go back.


i started walking, and noticed a flight of stairs going down, i wanted to explore the rest of the house, but curiosity got the best of me, and i started going down, before the wooden stairs broke down, it felt like it hadn't been touched in years, i fell down, into the basement, but now, i couldn't get out, it was no longer a matter of finish the objective, it was a matter of stay alive and get the fuck out of there.


i start walking down the basement, step by step, making sure no sound was made, i walked, until, i saw light, i got a bit closer, and noticed it was a lamp, and it was on a table, but the weird thing was, something was on that table, i immediately went there, and on the table there was a human body, only that it had been filled with that black substance, on the inside, it was pouring out from its mouth, leaking from it's nose, dripping from its ears, next to it was a piece of paper that looked to be about 10 years old at that point, it read, in broken barely readable English, "Experiment 21", below the big bold font header, there was, some text, i don't remember exactly what it said, but it was something along the lines of testing if a human can be brought back to life using ------ before the voice in my head could go further, the body in the table moved, it looked like the substance was injecting itself into the body, there was no longer a substance in it's mouth, or it's nose for that matter, but its body got darker, and it started twitching.. before it grabbed onto my hand..


i tried not to scream in fear as to not alert anyone or anything for that matter of my presence, so i immediately grab one of the tools in the table - a hammer, and slammed into the thing's shoulders as hard as i can, it's arm disconnected from its body, i could see, liquid that was, blood, except black, dripping out, but something was off - the arm was still moving, but i do not care, i needed to get the hell out of there, so i walk a little further, and i find a trapdoor, on a dead end, and i decided to go down, Because why not, i had no other option, and i felt uncomfortable sitting in a room with something that was not Human.


i started going down, and bam, i see something..
 i said to myself
"oh my god..."
