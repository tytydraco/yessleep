I want to start this of by saying that I'm genuinely a good person. I believe in God, I go to church every Sunday. I preach the gospel and I pray for my friends and family, even the non-believers. I have no idea why this is happening to me and I have no idea how to get fix it. 
It all began last Saturday, when I was coming home from my colleague Nancy's bible study. She lives across town and I have to take the 8PM buss, as I don't have a licence or a car. It's very inconvenient and I honestly hate it, but she needs my help. And I want to keep my relationship with the Holy Spirit strong. Because this is what protects us from all the bad things, the bad people, sickness. I've always been consistent with everything relating to God, but
I'll be honest, I skipped bible study a few times last month and I think that this explains my current situation.
It all started when i caught a mild flu two weeks ago. I didn't have a fever or anything, but I figured I could take advantage of my situation, so I called in sick. I spent the entire day bed-rotting and watching TikTok. At some point I must have fallen asleep, because I woke up after dark with that stupid song playing on repeat over and over again, muffled by the sheets.

"You can ask the flowers, I sit for hours
Tellin' all the bluebirds, the bill and coo birds
Pretty little baby
I'm so in love with you"

Kept playing over and over again, the lyrics ringing on and on in my head. I tried desperately to find my phone, because the song was driving me crazy. 
Then something felt... off. The song stopped sounding annoying and turned into something one would hear in a horror movie soundtrack . I felt this unexplainable dread begin to wash over me for no apparent reason. I quickly got up to turn on the light, but the feeling didn't go away. I looked around my room in panic, nothing was out of place, but something felt wrong. 
I got down on my knees and rested my head on the bed. I placed my hands together and I began to pray:

"Heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears. Amen"

Then suddenly, the song stopped playing. I let out a sigh of relief and felt a smile begin to grow on my face, because I knew God was watching over me and listening to my prayers, always keeping me safe.
My little nap had left me sweaty and gross, so I went in to take a shower. I usually shower for around 15 minutes, but this time i decided to stay for longer. I always wash with hot water, even though the boiler can't always handle this much pressure and begins to automatically cool the water. I've personally never had an issue with that, but my neighbour Mrs Wilson tends to complain about it often. I guess I'll have to slip in another pamphlet for our bible study under her door. Who knows, maybe when she begins attending she'll learn that being a good neighbour is a heavenly virtue. 

When I left the steamy bathroom the cold of the bedroom hit me. It crawled under my skin in an unpleasant way. As if bugs were biting me all over. 
I got dressed and i went to get the blow dryer from my vanity drawer, only to find it missing. Then i remembered that I used it on some stupid arts and crafts project and I left it in the living room. I went to go get it, but I stopped dead centre in the hallway. A strange smell hit my nose and I began sniffing. It was a horrible, gnarly smell. Like rotten eggs or bad cabbage. 
I felt sick from it, but I couldn't determine the source of the smell. I always keep my home clean, I always throw away food past its expiration date. This didn't make any sense to me. 
I was frozen in place, I couldn't move for the life of me. As if my muscles and joints were being held there intentionally. The smell became overwhelming, irritating, insufferable. 
Then I saw it. A tall, dark silhouette slowly walked from my kitchen to the living room. Its limbs were long, too long for its body. Its hands dragged at its side, as if weighing it down. Its steps were uneven, somehow crooked.
I knew in that moment that my inability to move was no accident. Jesus himself was holding me in place, protecting me. I felt his love and that filled me with courage. I felt this urge to shout 

"By the power of Christ, I command you to return to hell!"

But those words came out less confident than I was intending. My confident declaration sounded more like a little child shouting at the monster in the closet. The creature sensed the fear in my voice and stopped in its tracks as if to indulge in the moment. it looked at me. Its eyes were red, bright and evil. It stared at me for a moment, then it turned and walked into the deep, dark abyss of the kitchen. I took this opportunity and I ran back to my room, locking the door behind me. My breaths were heavy and exhausting. I was shaking uncontrollably. I rummaged in every drawer I had in the room for something, anything that could protect me- like a rosary, holy water, a cross or a bible or something, anything to ward this evil away. 
I started sobbing uncontrollably, unable to catch my breath. I felt as if my own tears would drown me. I thought of Jesus, of my saviour. I began praying with all my strength:

"Heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears, heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears Heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears, heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears.Heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears, heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears.Heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears, heavenly father, please watch over me and remove my fears."

At one point it felt as if the entire room was shaking, as if the floor beneath me would fall. At some point I must have passed out, because I when I opened my eyes again I was on the floor and light was coming from the cracks in the shutters. 
I immediately got up to look for my phone. I found it relatively easily and I plugged it in. I gathered the courage to walk out of my room into the kitchen and living room area. It was easier said than done though, but I started visualising a white light around me, a shield against Satan and evil. That made the journey somewhat lighter. 
I made a cup of tea to ease my worsened sore throat. Falling asleep with wet hair while already feverish was not a good idea, but I figured more sick days for me.
I went back to my room as soon as I can and I immediately called Father James- the priest from my congregation.

"Hello, Father James?" 
I called into the phone, my voice shaking and hoarse from my sore throat. 

"Good morning, Mallory. What's up? Are you feeling alright, you don't sound so good."
The pastor asked with a hint of concern.

"No, actually. I'm not doing okay."
I said with some trouble because of my raspy throat.
"Can I speak to you after the sermon today?"

"Of course you can. I'm always here to listen and help. Might I ask though, what's the matter of concern?" 
He sounded worried. But i suppose that it's because the calls he usually gets this time of day are usually centred around him preaching at funerals. 

"I can't say over the phone. I'm not safe." 
I said into the phone after some very careful consideration. I also wanted him to understand that this was something important.

"I understand. I hope to see you at the sermon, before we can talk."

"I'll try to make it, Pastor. Thank you, truly."
I said, knowing full well that I didn't plan on attending it. I disliked his sermons, they were far too theological for my taste, far too complex. I avoided going to church on the Sundays when I knew he'd be the one preaching.

"Of course, my dear. Stay blessed."

I hung up the phone after that. I had some time before I had to leave, so I decided to look into what I saw last night. 
A lot of different results came up, such as a black dog, or a shadow person. But none of those mentioned the smell. That left only one possibility, a demon. But that was impossible. I'm a good, honest person. I'm righteous, humble. I donate to charity constantly, i feed homeless dogs. I always say "please" and "thank you". There's no way that something like that could latch itself onto me specifically. It didn't make sense. 

It was close to 11AM already so gathered all the papers on which I wrote down all my findings by hand and I made my way over to the bus stop that was down the block from my apartment. The bus was surprisingly late, it usually comes at around 11:05 at the latest. I waited, overthinking my situation. It was so deeply unfair. I checked the time on my phone- it was 11:17 now, no bus in sight. I  couldn't wait any longer, so I got up and started walking to the church. The walk was around half an hour, but it felt much longer than that. By the time I made it to the old church, there was barely anyone there.
I went inside, the dust from the old building irritated my nostrils. 

"Mallory, I'm so glad to see you."
An old voice called out to me from behind. It was Father James.

"I'm sorry, the bus was late."
I said, sniffing 

"Oh? But don't you take the 11AM bus from the West side of town?"
He asked, raising an eyebrow in concern

"Usually, yes. But today it didn't come on time and I couldn't wait any longer to talk to you."

Father James sighed and shook his head in disbelief
"Thank the Lord you weren't on that bus. Mrs. Michaels said it was involved in an accident. I feared the worst, that you were on it.

"What do you mean? What happened?"
I asked, the reality of the situation not hitting me just yet. 

"Oh, I'm not sure. I didn't think to ask, such a tragedy. But yet again, the lords plans are strange indeed."
He said, putting a hand on his temples and rubbing 
"So, what can I help you with?"

"I think I'm being haunted by a demon."

"That is a serious concern. What makes you think that?"

"Yesterday I saw something, a tall back creature, hunched over. It was super tall and super evil. It probably would have lunged straight at me, had I not used the lords name against it."

"Okay, that's good. You did the right thing. Let it know you are divinely protected. What happened after that?"
He said confidently after careful consideration

"It disappeared into thin air. But I felt its presence." 

"Demons do that, yes. They like to get up close and personal. This is far from over, I'm afraid that this is just the beginning."
The pastor said in a serious tone, grabbing me by the shoulders 
"We don't have time. We have to act now."

"But isn't there a way to contact the Vatican? To send an expert?"

"To submit a case to the Vatican we have to build an extensive evidence portfolio. Multiple first hand witness accounts. Those cases take months to reach the regional committee, let alone an actual representative of the church. And even after that they probably get tossed in the garbage before they can even reach a member of the high clergy. We are alone on this one."
Father James said in a deep, serious tone

"I'll come to your apartment. I'll cleanse all the rooms one by one and I'll give you some  wooden crosses you can put up in each one of the rooms."

"I'll be back. Stay here. Go to the stands and pray. Or you can go to the confessional. Father Jacob should be there." 
Father James rushed into another room and I was left all but alone. I made my way over to the wooden confessionals that were probably from the 18th century. 
I sat and I looked into the booth. I saw Father Jacob from behind the curtain. 

"Forgive me father, for I have sinned."
I started, unsure of what to say. I haven't been to confessionals before.

"I fear that I have neglected God and that now he's punishing me."
I try my hardest to steady my voice, but to little luck 
"I haven't gone to bible study at all in the recent weeks." 
I feel tears rolling down my cheeks. My voice begins to tremble and I fall into emotion
"And now there's a demon in my apartment that probably wants to kill me because the bus crashed that I was supposed to be on." 
I put my face in my hands and I began to sob quietly. But the church was empty and my silent wales echoed off the walls. Then a voice came out from inside the booth.

"Pathetic" 
The voice was deep, drawn out and raspy. I did not recognise it to be Father Jacob. 
I got up and I walked to the side of the booth. I opened the little door with the rusty hinges and I looked inside- it was empty. 

My hands were shaking, I had trouble letting go of the handle, fearing that if I released it, I might fall to the ground and never get back up. My stomach hardened, my vision blurred. My head was empty... empty.
Apart from one thought:
I'm not safe here. 

Then Father James came out of the room. He saw the state I was in and rushed to comfort me. 
"It's here, father."
The words came out barely a whisper. 

"Its impossible. A demonic entity has no power in Gods house." 
He said, reassuringly
"You'll always be safe here. Nothing can hurt you. This is where God is strongest. You have WiFi at your place I assume?"
He asked and I nodded, not quite getting what he meant.
"Your internet connection is strongest when you are in the same room as the router, right? Now take this and remove the word "internet" and change router with "God"."
He sounded so confident, so sure. That managed to calm me down enough for us to continue preparing. He had me fill some plastic bottles with holy water while he wrote down some special prayers to use. 
Once we were done he drove us my place with his car. An old, beat up Honda Civic. It smelled like root beer and lavender, it made me sick. I hate how cheap and depressing root beer smells. The drive was short, as I don't live far, but it felt longer than it should have been.

He parked the car across the street from my place and he got out. He gestured for me to do the same, but I felt like I was frozen in place. I didn't want to go, but I got up anyway. 

"Are you afraid?"
Father James asked me, his voice eerily calm.
I didn't respond. He nodded to signal that he understood and we made our way in.
The further up we went, the faster my heart paced. I could feel it hitting strongly against my rib cage as if just a small amount of force on top would cause it to break out of my chest and flop right there on the floor. 
We got to my door and I fumbled for my keys. I couldn't find them.

"Father... I must have dropped my keys somewhere. They're not in my pockets."
I said, my voice shaky and breathless.
But then I remembered- Mrs Wilson has my spare keys! Finally, a sigh that god was on my side again. 
I went up to her door and rang the doorbell. No one answered. I rang again, twice this time. I heard commotion coming from inside the apartment before the door flung open.

"If you don't stop harassing me, I'm going to call the feds! Am I making myself clear? I'm
not interested in your religious bullshit!"
She yelled at me, her box dyed blonde hair that she had in rollers seemed like it would come undone from the force of her decibels. 

"I-I lost my keys. Could I have the spare ones I left with you last year?"
I said, my voice low and stammering

"Ahh, why bother me when you have Jesus on your side? He's always looking out for you, right? Maybe he can help find your keys."
She went inside of her apartment and came back with the keys 

"I'll tell you what. If you don't come back down to earth, I have no idea how you'll make it any longer in the real world."
She said, no longer yelling, but rather scolding, lecturing. 

"Thanks. I'll make you some cookies when all of this blows over."

"Hah! And give me half a dozen brochures with ""Jesus is king"" written on them? Keep that to yourself. I'm not interested."
She said, slamming the door in my face

"Unbelievable."
Father James muttered, but I didn't respond. I just wanted all of this to be over with.

When we entered my apartment, I felt a strong sense of unease. That feeling when prey walks into a bush, not knowing if it'll find a predator lurking inside. It's what I imagined it to feel like.
Father James immediately got to work. He lit incense, sprinkled holy water on every surface, he changed, shouted Latin phrases. He helped me place a cross in each of the rooms. That all made me feel much better. The energy of the place had shifted, it felt like my home again. Father James also noted the immediate shift in the energy.

"You see? God is here with us now. He'll watch over you tonight. Sleep easy. If there's anything you need, call me. I'll be on duty."
He said before leaving.
And if I have to be honest, for the first week everything seemed back to normal. I got back to my usual routine, as if the events of the previous days were nothing more than a terrible nightmare. 
And I would have gone on as I was, and I probably wouldn't be here, writing this.  But 3 days ago, I saw that the cross from my kitchen had gone missing. Then 2 days ago the cross from the living room was nowhere to be seen. Yesterday the cross from the hallway vanished. I was convinced that Jesus was removing them, because they had served their use in protecting me and were now only filling up space. 
But today, as I was in bed almost asleep I heard something shuffling in my room. I didn't pay it any mind, until I felt a whisper from behind me:
"Where is your God now?"
