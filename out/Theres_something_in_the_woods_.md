This took place in Sweden outside of Norrtälje, Björkö, in the deep woods there. My friend is gone and no one undertands. I thought maybe you people here might take interest in what I experienced. I have videos from the hike but I thinking of going back to document it. Everyone says I’m going thru a hard time and that I don’t remember everything clear but I have to go back to sort my mind up. I’ve tried my best (I have no experience in writing long texts) but I’ve tried to write my experience as good as I can so you get to feel what I felt in the dark woods. I have nothing more to say, here it is:




It was one of those perfect summer days when the warmth feels like a soft blanket around you, and the whole world seems to be on pause. Henry and I had planned our hike for a long time. There was something about the Swedish forest, its silence and wildness, that had always called to us. We grew up on Björkö, just outside Norrtälje, and we had known each other since preschool. The forests around Barnens Ö were the backdrop for all our childhood adventures, but we had rarely ventured as deep into the woods as we planned to this time. This time, we wouldn’t just stop by the lake or at the usual spots. This time, we would go deep, beyond trails and maps, where few had set foot.

I remember it was a Saturday when we started, a warm and quiet morning. I met Henry at his house, an old shack probably built sometime in the 1940s. The door wasn’t quite sealed anymore, and it smelled like it always did—a mix of old wood, earth, and something sour from damp moss. Fernando, his loyal flat-coated retriever, greeted me happily, tail wagging. He was a large, muscular dog, always by Henry’s side, a force of nature on four legs.

“Do you have everything?” Henry asked as he saw me dragging my backpack. “Did you pack for rain?”

“Yeah, I’ve got most of it,” I replied, watching Fernando start sniffing my boots.

We both were experienced enough to know that the forest here was tough. The paths were tangled, and we’d need to find our own places to pitch our tents. We knew it would be hard days of long hiking, but at the same time, we were after something. An adventure like no other.

So we started walking. The pack was heavy, but the wind was cool, and we talked about the old days, about how we had always dreamed of going further than we had ever gone. Fernando ran ahead of us, just within sight, like a silent guide through the vast woods. The paths were so narrow that sometimes we had to crawl through the bushes, but we were used to it. We walked for hours, the whole day, until we finally set camp in a small clearing near a stream. The sun was setting behind the treetops, and a yellowish light filled the forest.

That evening, as we sat around the campfire, Fernando was unusually still. He lay at our feet, but his eyes were alert. Occasionally, he lifted his head, as if he heard something we didn’t. Henry and I didn’t talk much at that point. We mostly just lay there, watching the fire, listening to the sounds of the surroundings—the wind in the trees, the babbling water, distant birdcalls. Before we went to bed, we followed the stream down to a small lake to wash our hands and the dishes from dinner. I pulled out my phone to capture a memory and was about to film the lake when we heard something.

It was a cracking sound, as if someone was carefully walking through the forest. We sneaked back to the tent without saying a word; we both knew we weren’t alone anymore. Fernando immediately rose when he saw us creeping toward the tent. He stood there silently, without making a sound, just staring into the depth of the forest. I tried not to show my worry, but I felt it. There was something about the night, something in the air that wasn’t right. The forest, usually so alive with sound, had suddenly fallen silent. It was a kind of stillness that felt as if the forest itself was holding its breath.

“Do you think it’s an animal?” Henry asked, his voice soft, almost uncertain.

“I don’t know…” I replied, looking at Fernando. His body was stiff, but he made no move to warn us. “Maybe. But I’ve never heard anything like this.”

The sounds grew closer, and we both heard them now. It wasn’t like when an animal moves through the forest. It was slow, deliberate, and sometimes it almost sounded like someone was dragging their hands over the bark of the trees. Fernando began to growl low, his gaze fixed on a spot deeper in the woods. His growls grew more intense, but he didn’t move. It was as if he didn’t want to leave our side, even though he was scared.

“We should probably check it out,” Henry said after a long silence, and we both slowly got to our feet. We moved away from the campfire so as not to disturb the darkness with the light from our flashlights. Fernando followed us closely, but his movements were more cautious than usual.

That was when we saw it.

It was just a glimpse at first. A quick movement between the trees. Something very long and thin, almost shapeless. I didn’t quite catch it, but it was as if a pale, naked figure was blending with the forest. Its arms were so long they almost touched the ground, and its body was pale, almost translucent. I heard Henry suck in a sharp breath next to me, and Fernando hissed, as if ready to charge.

But before we could say anything, it was gone. Vanished into the darkness. Just a quick, unsettling movement, as if it had never been there at all.

We stood still for a long time, just staring at the spot where we had seen it. The air was colder now, and I could feel my hands begin to shake.

“What the hell was that?” Henry said, his voice more mockery than a question.

“I don’t know…” I replied, but there was something in my voice that didn’t match. We went back to the tent, but neither of us could stop looking at the darkness around us. I had a feeling that creature was still out there. And it wasn’t just me who felt it.

The next day, we continued our journey through the woods, and each step felt heavier. I remember how we, without saying much, just let our breaths break the silence. Henry was quieter than usual, Fernando even more alert, and that was when I truly felt that something was wrong. But I didn’t want to believe it. I didn’t want to believe that it was anything more than the quiet, inviting atmosphere of the forest and its animals’ everyday sounds.

We hiked for hours without hearing anything else unusual, no figures to remind us of the night before, but when we had walked practically all day and the sun’s rays were slowly sinking, something changed. Fernando, usually the most energetic dog I knew, started acting strangely. His tail hung low, and his gaze was fixed on something in the woods ahead, far beyond what we could see. I tried to get him to move, but he was frozen. And then we heard it.

At first, it was just a faint cracking, like something walking slowly through the bushes. Then the sound grew louder and clearer, as if something was moving through the forest with intent. And that’s when I saw it. A movement between the trees. Something tall, thin, pale. A shape moving so fast that I barely had time to process what it was before it was gone again.

“What the hell was that?” Henry said, his voice low, as if he wanted to deny what we’d just seen.

I didn’t know what to say. I felt uneasy, as if we were no longer the only ones existing in this forest. Fernando growled low, his body taut like a bowstring, and his eyes were focused on a spot deeper in the darkness.

We kept walking, but I knew we weren’t alone anymore. I could feel it in the air, like the whole forest was suffocating under some invisible presence. When we reached a small clearing to set up our tent, I began to feel an uncomfortable sensation in my body. It was close now. The creature. I knew it.

It was when we were lying in the tent, the fire weak and the forest quiet, that we heard it again. A sound, low, whispering. It wasn’t wind, it wasn’t an animal. It was something else. And suddenly, Fernando was gone. He sprinted off into the darkness, without making a sound, just a swift movement of legs. We called for him, but there was no response.

We ran after him through the dark forest, and suddenly we heard him, far away in the woods, in what sounded like a struggle—a guttural bark, a hissing sound. But before we could reach him, Fernando was gone. Completely gone. And Henry… Henry disappeared with him. I searched for hours. I called for him, but all I heard were echoes. When we returned to the clearing, everything was silent.

I was alone. Alone in the dark forest.
All I could hear was the calm wind rustling in the trees, and I could only see a few meters ahead of me before the thick darkness closed in around me.

That’s when I saw the treehouse. I don’t know how I hadn’t seen it earlier. Maybe the darkness had crept up on me, maybe I was too confused, but when I saw it, I knew it was my only chance. I climbed up, struggling against my tired legs and trembling hands. I was about to pull myself up when something cold and sharp grabbed my leg, and a sharp pain shot through my limb. I fought, pulled, and finally, whatever it was let go, and I scrambled up into the rickety treehouse. I hadn’t even sat down properly when I felt the unsettling sensation of being watched. The creature. I knew it saw me. I could feel it in every fiber of my being.

I sat still, breathing quietly, staring out into the dark. I didn’t want to move, but I knew it was waiting. I tried something. I picked up a pinecone from the ground and threw it far away, just to test. When the pinecone landed, I heard it immediately—fast steps, much faster than I’d thought possible. Something was moving toward the pinecone, and I saw it. In the shadow, where the darkness enveloped everything, I saw a pale figure—tall, thin, naked, with arms too long hanging by its sides. I only saw a shadow, but I knew it was there, that it was coming toward me.

I knew I didn’t have much time. I only had one chance to get away. But every time I tried to climb down from the treehouse, every time I thought I could run, I felt it there, waiting for me. It was faster than me, stronger than me.

So I waited. I waited, because I knew that if I moved too early, it would come. And I wasn’t sure if I’d ever escape.

Eventually, it disappeared. Or maybe it was just silent, hidden in the shadows. I didn’t know, but I no longer heard those quick steps. And when I felt it was safe, I jumped down from the treehouse and ran. I ran for my life. I heard the fast steps behind me, the dull sound of its body moving through the bushes and branches. I heard its breathing, heavy and guttural, as if it were close. I didn’t dare look back, but I knew it was there, so close I could feel its presence in the air around me.

I ran and ran, until my legs ached and my breathing became rapid and shallow. I saw nothing but trees, bushes, and darkness. I heard the steps getting closer behind me, hot breath on my neck, and a stench of rotting meat. I thought it was over, that I was completely exhausted. But then, suddenly, when I thought I felt its teeth brush my shoulder, I flew out of the woods and onto a road. I fell and couldn’t catch myself. Disoriented, I stumbled to my feet and looked up at the edge of the forest. There, in the shadows, it stood. I saw its cold, white eyes glowing in the darkness, and I was so scared. I’ve never been so scared in my life. I didn’t break eye contact with those two glowing eyes for even a second, and I thought I saw them come closer and closer. When I realized the creature was moving toward me, it was too late. In the span of a second, the long, thin creature flew toward me with enormous force, and I closed my eyes. All I heard was the sound of tires screeching against the asphalt. And then everything went even darker.

I woke up in a hospital room two weeks later. My body was stiff, pain I didn’t even know the source of was in every limb, but I was alive. They said I’d been hit by a car on the country road. I had been in a coma for fourteen days.

Henry and Fernando were gone. Missing. The police had searched the woods, launched search efforts with dogs and volunteers, but they had found nothing. And eventually, after weeks of searching, they gave up. They declared both Henry and Fernando dead, and I lost all hope of getting answers.

I’ve tried to tell everyone—my parents, doctors, therapists—but they say what I remember isn’t real. That my brain distorted the memories due to the crash. That everything I remember is a twisted version of what happened.

I tried to believe it, to get some peace. I tried to convince myself that Henry and Fernando just got lost in the woods. But there’s one thing I can’t explain. One thing no one else can explain.

I have a scar on my left calf that goes down to my heel. I asked the doctor about it, but he couldn’t explain it. I went through tests, saw specialists—but no one could explain how I got a scar that looks like a long gash, as if a long, thin nail had scratched my skin. And despite everything I’ve tried to suppress, despite everyone saying it wasn’t real—I know what I saw. And I know what chased us.

And that creature, the one I saw flying toward me from the darkness, I know it’s still waiting for me. And I won’t be safe until I see it again. I know I have to go back into the woods, I have to find Henry, I’m going back to document it and take pictures.
