Nobody seemed to care. It was the strangest thing. She had just started school, barely five years old. I was a protective older brother, and even I had a hard time worrying about her. It was like there was a haze about her name. When I tried to think of her, my mind went fuzzy. 

But still, the flicker in the back of my mind would not be quenched. Where had she gone? I pushed through the fog and started asking questions. I was ten at the time, maybe eleven, but I seemed to care more than any adult did. I went to the cops, and they brushed me off. I put up posters, but they were all taken down. Even my own parents seemed confused why I cared so much. But I kept at it. 

My first lead was when I saw the hunched figure taking down a poster I had stapled to a telephone pole. They were completely covered in clothing, with a shawl around their head and shoulders. It was an odd sight, as it was quite a warm day. I remember that. I tried to point it out to my parents as we drove past, but they paid me no mind. 

I kept a sharp eye out after that. I rode my bike through the streets, trying to focus on finding the figure. Yet so often I would lose sight of my goal, and return home confused. But I never truly forgot. 

Eventually, my evening excursions paid off. I saw the figure retreating from the same telephone pole that I placed a poster at every day. I had finally thought to sit and wait, and sure enough, the old figure came shambling down the street, and took down the poster without a second thought. It then promptly headed back the way it had come. 

I had been hiding around a nearby fence, and I followed at a distance. The figure picked up the pace, and moved surprisingly fast after that. I had to run to keep up, stealth all but abandoned. I nearly lost the figure when it abruptly turned into a copse of trees on a large, forgotten plot of land. 

I dashed in behind, but lost my quarry in the trees. Darkness was falling, but I was close. I had no flashlight, this was well before the smartphone, so I stumbled in the evening dark, until I eventually came across a small shack, dilapidated and rotting. 

I remember being surprised that I had never found it before, nor had any of the other boys my age who so loved to explore. But there was a haze about that place too. I only remember it all these years later for what I found inside. And even then, usually only in nightmares. I had one such last night, which is why I now write my memories, before they fade again. 

I approached and crouched to peer through a crack in the wood. I looked down into a candlelit basement, as the floor of the main landing had rotted away. There I saw the figure, disrobed and hunched over a table. 

Blood was everywhere, covering its pallid skin, and splattering the floor and table before it. It appeared to be female, as I could just make out sagging breasts drooping over the table. 

She turned and saw me then, as if she had known I was there. I was frozen, and my mind filled with such a haze that I cannot remember how I came to be in her clutches, only that my next moments of sentience came to me in the bowels in the decrepit house, being caressed by decrepit hands. 

“My child,” the crone croaked. Her face was sallow, and her mouth dribbled with slime. I was bound to a chair, forced to witness her. She licked me, her putrid and stinking tongue sliding across my cheek. Then she turned back to her work. 

As she shambled back to her bloodstained table, I got a better look at the room. Effigies were posted about the walls, made from human skin, and stuffed with what smelled like rotting meat. Though, the stench was probably from the floor, which was absolutely covered in viscera. 

I vomited and wished desperately to pass out, but I couldn’t tear my eyes away. The foul mockeries of life stared at me from all around, their faces stretched and distorted. But what demanded my attention was the table to which the horrible woman had returned. She was stuffing a skin with fetid entrails, carefully placing the meat in each segment in order to create her perverse dolls, scooping what she didn’t use into her mouth, and swallowing it with relish. Bones were piled in a corner, an indication as to why each creation was fleshy and limp. 

Then I saw the hair and the face of her project. It was my sister. I finally found it in me to scream, which seemed to perturb the hag. She rose her face in a grotesque snarl, and lunged for me. I fought at my restraints, and succeeded in toppling my chair before she could reach me. I continued in my desperate fight, even as she descended on me. 

My screaming did not only rouse the crone, however. Her abominations began a gurgling chorus, flailing upon their impalements. It was distracting to say the least. My tormentor looked on in confusion, which then turned to horror as they began popping like overstuffed pustules. 

“MY CHILDREN!” she screamed, rushing over to them. In that moment, I saw the hollow form of my sister, barely filled with meat, move an arm that swished like an empty tube, and knock over a nearby candelabra. It landed amidst a pile of old wood, which caught quickly. 

The hag was too preoccupied wallowing in the remains of her broken creations to notice the rising flames. I continued to fight against my restraints, until I pulled a hand free, just as smoke filled the shack. Confusion reigned as it became harder to see and breathe. I felt a heavy body crash into me, shattering my wooden chair. 

Her flesh was bubbly and hot, and tore away like tissue paper when I pushed against it. My hands flailed, until I found a broken shaft of wood. I poked it into her flesh, and it gave way with little resistance. I pushed it in as much as I could with the witch crushing me. I was fortunate that the pain was great enough to force her away from me. 

And then I scrambled away. I scrabbled at the rotting wood of the shack wall, and felt as if I would pass out from lack of oxygen. I could hear the woman, if that’s indeed what she was, crashing around behind me. Then, a partial collapse of the building. Everything had happened so fast. It felt as if the building had only been burning for a minute or so. But all the same, the ceiling came down in a cloud of dust. I think it landed on her, but I didn’t stop to check.

I clambered out on the smoking wood, before it too caught flame. I ran with a limp through the dark trees, until I found the street again. The blaze lit the night orange, and as I hobbled home, I saw fire trucks rushing toward it. None stopped for me though. Not the police that zoomed by, nor any bystander who came to look. 

When I got home I tried to tell my parents what I saw. What had happened to me. But they were deaf to it. So was everyone I told. I don’t even know if this story will work, if it will reach anyone who can understand it, let alone believe it. So I hold this tale in my memory, and revisit it in my nightmares. And perhaps that is where it belongs.
