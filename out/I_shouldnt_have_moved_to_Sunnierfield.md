It’s a town, but it’s *not* a town.

Sure, it has a post office. A few shops. Restaurants. Office blocks. Even a small, local cinema. It has job opportunities and a burgeoning suburbia. It has all the makings of an ordinary town in an ordinary part of the world.

But Sunnierfield is not the sum of its parts.

I arrived on a stiff, scalding day in June. I remember rolling my eyes as I passed a sign for ‘*Sunnierfield: A town of sun’*.

“Truly the slogan of all time,” I joked.

Regardless, the oddly uninventive sign didn’t diffuse the bubbly energy in my belly. I’d been eagerly awaiting that day for months. I’m a journalist for an online magazine, so I was ecstatic to write an article about a new town. However, as I drove along the main road, passing rows of cloned houses, I wasn't sure how I’d begin.

It’s hard to describe Sunnierfield, after all. The town has no identity, other than the smiling face it wears so well. A mask not quite snug enough to conceal its falseness. Even my new home, a gorgeous modern build, looked a little sterile. There was no way to fault it, but that was exactly what unnerved me. There was no way to fault it. And after I’d unloaded my scarce belongings from my Ford Mondeo — several cardboard boxes and a couple of bags — I hurried away to explore the town. I didn't even unbox or unpack. I felt uncomfortable in my own home.

But the town was no better. The pavements of the main street were built with tightly-packed tiles of asphalt, forming an impossibly straight line through the very heart of the town. My eyes felt strained. Looking at Sunnierfield’s architecture for too long left me cold. Why had I not felt that way when I saw the advert for the town? It looked almost the same as the pictures, after all.

And then I realised what was different. It was *precise*. Too precise to be man-made.

I remember reading something once about the concept of perfect shapes. Perfect circles and straight lines are metaphysical concepts. They don’t exist in reality. But they exist in Sunnierfield. Even the people are perfect. Well, the blue shirts. Folks wearing blue, plaid shirts. I noticed the uniformed people on my very first day. Men and women. All donning matching smiles to go with their matching shirts. Smoothly-curved smiles. Still faces. That was the distinction I began to notice. They were soulless. Not quite real.

And when I reached the local grocery shop, something triggered my instincts. I felt a burning sensation in the back of my head. When I turned to face the town behind me, I saw that most people kept walking — the ordinary people. But the blue shirts sharply spun their heads forwards.

*They’d been watching me whilst my back was turned to them.*

Horrified, I shook my head to rid it of the chittering, bug-like thoughts. It’s social anxiety, I decided, as most people would. Anxiety induced by the big move. I was feeling nervous about such a huge life change. Second-guessing my decision. That was natural, given I’d moved away from friends and family members. All of my feelings were natural. That was what I told myself.

I smiled at shoppers as I walked into the store. And suddenly, I felt happy again. As if a miniature worker had remembered to flip an ‘on’ switch in the mood department of my brain. I no longer had a care in the world, and I mirrored the joyous townsfolk around me, happily shovelling groceries into my trolley.

When I queued to pay, I listened to the overlapping conversations of my fellow customers. And that was when I noted numerous accents — Australian, French, and Russian voices created an international cocktail of colourful tones. To the side, a blonde-haired surfer fellow and a rather disgruntled Japanese lady were talking to a member of staff. He looked a little sickly, and she looked animated.

As for the worker, he was a man of average build, average height, and average weight. In fact, his entire appearance was utterly forgettable. Other than the blue shirt he wore.

“Hey!” A jovial American voice sounded behind me.

I turned to face a beaming man with bulky glasses and a comforting smile. A man of small size, but not spirit. There was, however, a vacancy in his eyes. Though I know mine would’ve told a similar story.

“Hi,” I replied, returning the smile.

“I’m Marc,” He said. “Are you new? I don’t recognise you.”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “I moved here today, actually. Name’s Harvey.”

“Nice to meet you, Harvey! And is that an accent I detect? I do love a good accent,” He blushed. “I’m the only American who doesn’t mind a good British invasion. Bring ‘em here, I say!”

I nodded, raising an eyebrow. “It’s funny… I’ve heard so many different accents today. Who knew that people all over the world would want to move to an English town?”

Marc’s bright smile faltered for a second, and then it returned, as if he’d been reset.

But he spoke in a whisper. “Actually, Harvey, it’s–”

“– Everything okay, folks?” An artificial voice asked.

My head snapped around, and I faced the member of staff who had been arguing with the upset man and woman. The elderly lady was absent-mindedly walking down one of the aisles, but the blonde-haired man had disappeared from the store.

“We’re fine, Ainsley,” Marc smiled.

“Okay,” The worker replied, though he was staring at me. “And you, sir?”

I nodded slowly, and the staff member quickly walked away.

“You said his name. Do you know him?” I asked.

“I know all of them,” Marc whispered solemnly.

I didn’t know what he meant.

“Well, Ainsley had a strange energy,” I said.

Marc’s face twitched, as if his real self had woken once more. “Y’know, Harvey… I like to host film nights at my house. Would you like to come?”

I scratched my neck uncomfortably. “I, er… I was actually planning…”

“– You’re new. It’d be an opportunity to mingle,” Marc urged. “You must want to make some friends?”

“That’s a lovely offer, Marc, but I have to unpack my belongings,” I said. “My house is a tip right now.”

The American didn’t say anything else. He simply pleaded with his eyes — wide pupils magnified by the lenses of his prominent spectacles. I swallowed the sigh at the back of my throat, and I nodded pleasantly.

“I can delay unpacking until tomorrow,” I said.

Marc nodded, though he still didn’t seem happy, and we exchanged contact details.

Around eight o’clock that evening, I arrived at the man’s house and knocked on his door, shuffling nervously on my feet. Marc was real. Not like the blue people. But something still didn’t feel quite right about him. Nothing felt right about Sunnierfield. I could sense the abnormality of the place seeping into my pores. Controlling my mind. The smile on my face. It is a terrifying experience to feel simultaneously genuinely and falsely gleeful.

What’s happening to me? I wondered in horror.

When my new friend opened the front door, he was wearing a tight bow tie, a faded denim jacket, and an unwavering smile, as if our earlier conversation hadn’t happened.

“Harvey!” He cried joyously. “Come inside, buddy! I want you to meet the gang.”

The near-skipping gentleman, dressed in dapper garbs, led me through his familiar home. I realised it had an identical design to mine, other than his personal belongings. But that wasn’t too surprising in a new town. Everything was neatly and endlessly replicated.

“Everybody, this is Harvey!” Marc announced as we entered the living room.

There were three friends waiting in the lounge. The elderly Japanese lady from the store, a fragile woman in her mid-twenties, and a middle-aged man with a blocky build.

“That’s Emi, our wizened leader,” Marc said, motioning towards the elderly, waving woman. “And this little Barbie doll is Kendra.”

“Hey!” The young brunette said. “Screw you, Ken.”

Marc laughed. “And that bearded hunk is Bob.”

The middle-aged fellow simply offered a slight nod of the head.

“He’s not much of a talker,” Marc smirked. “But he’s a fellow Brit! He’ll make you feel at home.”

“Lovely to meet all of you,” I said, nodding awkwardly before sitting on a spare armchair. “What film are we watching?”

And just like that, everybody fell silent. The jubilant faces packed their things and left town. I understood what had happened. I felt it too. The Happy Switch had been flipped from ‘on’ to ‘off’. And I’d flipped it.

“This isn’t a Film Night. It’s a meeting,” Marc explained. “Harvey, you never should’ve come to Sunnierfield.”

The sun went down, as did the town’s illusion, and then came the terror. The dawning realisation that I was royally porked. Marc was telling me what I already knew. What I’d felt from the moment I crossed the border between reality and Sunnierfield.

“What’s wrong with this place?” I asked.

“Isn’t a place,” Bob grunted gruffly.

“You’ve noticed our accents, right?” Kendra asked.

“I don’t even speak English,” Emi muttered shakily. “But I can understand everyone. And everyone can understand me.”

My eyes narrowed. “What? I don’t…”

“This isn’t a British town, Harvey,” Marc said. “I came here from Utah. Took a left turn off Highway 12, and then I saw the sign.”

“I took a turning off an expressway near Tokyo,” Emi sniffled, gazing at her lap.

“I…” I paused, frowning at my fragmented memories. “I came off the M6. Near Warrington. Perhaps a little south of there. And then I… was here.”

Marc nodded. “It was the same for everyone. We were all drawn to this place. Job opportunities. Sunshine. Utopia.”

I shook my head disbelievingly. “This is nonsense. We can’t have reached the same town from different corners of the Earth. If I drive along the main road and take the exit, I–”

“– Would wake in bed,” Kendra finished. “We’ve tried to leave. Everybody has tried. We’re trapped here, Harvey.”

“No, that’s… That can’t be…” I insisted.

“You already know it’s true,” Marc said. “You seen the way this place was built. It doesn’t look human. Even the name feels wrong, doesn’t it? Sunnierfield. Feels like something’s interpretation of the perfect town.”

“It changes people,” Bob said. “It makes us… happy. But it’s not real happiness.”

“Yeah,” Marc continued. “And whenever we snap out of it, the town always puts us back on the right path.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“Do you remember Ainsley from the store?” Marc asked. “Well, he’s… not like us. He’s a worker. You’ll see them all over the town. They keep things ticking over. Keep us in line if we become… unhappy.”

“The blue shirts,” I whispered, eliciting nods from my new friends. “Who are they?”

“We don’t know,” Marc said. “I’ve been here longer than most. I was one of the first in town. And that was only four or five weeks ago. I’m not sure. Time is weird here. Back then, the whole place was full of blue shirts. I was grateful when some of these fine folk started showing up. Until I realised we were all stuck in this hole. But as long as we’ve got each other, we’ll be fine. We’ll… Wait, why hasn’t Austin turned up?”

The four friends anxiously looked around, as if they’d only become aware of their missing companion when they woke from the trance.

“He hasn’t been looking well lately,” Emi said. “Barely uttered two words when I saw him at the shop earlier.”

Then there came knocking at the door.

Everybody stiffened, sensing the wrongness in the air — the perfect air, reeking of roses. Well, to my nose. But Sunnierfield smells different to all people.

“Don’t,” Marc shook his head as Bob stood. “Don’t answer it.”

“I have to check,” The hulking man replied, marching towards the front hallway.

“Bob, I don’t feel good about this…” Kendra whispered. “Don’t answer the door.”

But the man had already reached the entrance, and the rest of us had shuffled into the living room’s doorway to see who had knocked at such a late hour.

It was the sickly, blonde-haired man from the store. But he no longer looked unwell. He looked fine. Just fine. Fine hair, fine smile, and fine eyes. Utterly average. Ordinary. Everyday.

He was wearing a blue, plaid shirt.

“Austin,” Bob warmly said. “We were wondering when you were–”

With a clunking sound from below the house, like a generator dying, all exterior lights extinguished. And when they returned, Austin was nowhere to be seen.

“Where did he go?” Marc gasped.

“And what was he wearing?” Emi asked. “It looked like…”

“– Don’t say it,” Marc pleaded. “Not Austin. It… It can’t be…”

“He looked drained…” Kendra whimpered. “Drained of all joy.”

They came a gurgling sound from a world beneath our feet, like a sink drain lapping up the last dregs of water. Only, it was louder than a bullhorn of Hell.

“What’s happening?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” Marc said, running back into the living room to look out of the windows. “I don’t know, Harvey. We’ve never seen anything like this.”

“The room has changed,” Emi whispered.

The old woman nodded at her surroundings, and we all looked around. The furnishings had semi-melted into the walls, as if drowning in a pool of wallpaper. And Marc’s photographs, lining the mantelpiece, all displayed an identical picture of Sunnierfield’s main street.

“What?” Kendra screamed. “Guys… The door…”

The living room door had vanished. Any time something slipped out of sight, it changed. I was too afraid to take my eyes off anything in the lounge. Too afraid to blink. And when I looked at Marc, the window behind him had also disappeared. We were trapped in a box room. A prison that felt smaller, somehow. It wasn’t just that there were no exits. It simply felt different. And if it were shrinking, it must’ve been doing so whenever we weren’t looking.

Marc yelled, pointing at one of the photos on the mantelpiece.

We all gathered around a framed picture much like all of the others, except it displayed a moving shape. A figure was walking down the road. Striding closer.

“Austin…” Bob grunted. “How is he…”

“– He’s walking towards us,” Emi whispered, backing away.

And I did the same. All of us did the same. Except for Kendra. She stood still, transfixed by the man walking towards the front of the photograph.

“Kendra, get away from it!” Marc barked. “What are you doing?”

“I…” Kendra began.

Before she said anything else, a hand burst through the frame, ripping a hole in the photo and shattering the glass encaging it. Austin’s fingers seized Kendra’s neck and lifted her from the carpet. His demonic face followed. The lifeless face of something that used to be a man. A face neither happy nor sad. Forgettable.

But his actions were unforgettable. I’ll never rid my ears of Kendra’s howls as Austin began to pluck translucent threads from the corners of her eyes, unspooling her very soul. She wheezed and brayed like a dying foal. Her skin became cracked, drying dirt, and Austin consumed the mysterious, invisible substance from her eye sockets.

“Do something!” Emi croaked, shaking feebly.

Marc unleashed a battle-cry, charging into the fray with a bottle in his hand. He swung it at Austin’s face, sending the horrific man reeling back into the world of the photograph. Motivated by a similar burst of adrenaline, I surged forwards and began shredding every photograph in the room with eager fingers. Everyone else joined.

And in the final photograph I held, I saw Austin. The man in the blue shirt. I screamed as I felt a tug in my brain — he was already starting to unravel the thread which held my soul together. Hands trembling in fear, wrestling with the force that sought to control my mind, I tore the last picture in half.

A bellow sounded from below, and, with no more than a blink, the room returned to normal. The door and the windows reappeared. All furnishings were in the right places. There were torn photographs of Marc and his family on the carpet — the pictures no longer displayed Sunnierfield.

“Kendra?” Emi sobbed, kneeling beside the aged, withered woman who was lying on the floor.

“Kill me,” Kendra gasped. “Kill me before I become like him.”

“Kendra, I… No…” Marc sobbed. “We–”

“– I will never feel joy again,” She whispered coldly. “I know it. Better than I have ever known anything. Do you know how that feels, Marc?”

He shook his head, tears collecting in his eyes.

“It feels like nothing,” Kendra said.

Bob walked over, placing a hand on Marc’s shoulder. “It must be done.”

My eyes widened in horror as the huge man raised a large knife — one he’d mysteriously acquired — and plunged it into Kendra’s face without a moment’s thought. No questioning the horrifying nature of her request. He brutally murdered the girl within seconds of her uttering those final words. With no cares in the world. As if it were any ordinary Monday.

And then another terrifying thing happened.

*We all laughed.*

I’d never felt such joy. Never found anything so comical in my life. My heart swelled with absolute contentment. There was a brightness in my bones. I felt entirely well. Healthy. Happy. But I simultaneously felt terror at my lack of empathy. Terrified that I found Kendra’s death so humorous.

“Who else thinks Austin still looked cute as heck?” Marc asked, possessed by Sunnierfield once more. “I’ll tell you this much. Demon or not, I would.”

We chortled heartily, before enjoying an evening of festivities and films. We danced, sang, and partied around the corpse of Kendra, whose knifed face bled into Marc’s chic, Peruvian rug. But he was only concerned about the stain.

And I endured a 10-month trance. I have seen hundreds of people come and go since last June. Today, the Happy Switch flipped off for the first time in a long time. I recalled the horrors of that day and finally woke up. I have been asleep for nearly a year. And I must free myself whilst there is still time.

I realise that this place is feeding us with happiness. That’s what makes us taste so divine.

We are trapped in Sunnierfield, and we need help before this place drinks our [joy](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle).
