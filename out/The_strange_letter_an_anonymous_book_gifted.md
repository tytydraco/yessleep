I go to this local library fairly often, it's like a second home to me. The people here, the smell of the books, the coffee shop inside. Everything is perfect.

Today was different. Very different. 

As I walked into the library today, something majorly felt off. Very off. The atmosphere felt vastly different. "It's just a gut feeling, there's nothing wrong"I thought. 

I ordered my usual cup of coffee, just then one of the staffs there call me. "This is Mike right?" She asked. "Yeah"
"Someone has gifted a book to you, Mike."
"Oh, amazing, do you know who sent it?"
"I'm sorry, the sender didn't mention their name, I'm new here so I don't know them."
"I see, thank you"

I was excited yet confused, why would someone randomly gift me a book? Who could it be? I sat down with my coffee and started reading, drawn in so quickly. The sender had great taste. 

I was completely hooked, I turned the pages quicker than usual, it didn't even feel as if I was reading. But soon that flow state I was in got disturbed when I notice something between the next two pages.
A regular envelope resplendently laid there right in front of my eyes. 
I opened it up. 

"Dear Mike, follow my instructions carefully.
Once the clock hits four, do not speak, do not question anything you see. Follow what the rest of the people do. Please be careful. Do exactly as I say."

I felt frightened. It was 5 minutes to 4.
I didn't have much time to comprehend what I just read. These five minutes of my life, felt more anxious than anything. "Maybe it's a prank right" I thought to myself.

It was four and it got pin drop silent. Everyone stopped what they were doing. I did the same. Soon they all gathered together and made a circle. Straight posture. No one was even blinking. No expressions what so ever.


There were about 30 people here. We all stood together silently for around a few seconds then suddenly as if something snapped, they all started behaving different. Inhuman. Their hands moved in weird directions, you could hear the noise of bones cracking and soon like zombies they bent down, facing their head to the ground. They started walking is way in unique paths. I followed what they did. we often bumbed into each other. And soon this stopped. They got up and went back to what they were going.

I felt really scared. I waited for what would happen next, it was exactly four ten and the zombie like stance they were in disappeared. Everyone went back to normal. I asked people around, "Hey what just happened?" They all looked confused claiming that nothing unusual took place. They didn't remember anything that has happened. It felt as if everyone was possessed.

I was ready to just pack my stuff and leave as fast as I could. No way was I coming here again, no amount of therapy would fix this. I grabbed my book as I headed my way out. As I picked up the book, another envelope came out. This envelope was never there. I clearly remembered. More anxiety crept in as I opened the second envelope.

" Dear Mike,
Be here tomorrow during the time you regularly come at. Follow as I say if you don't want to get in trouble"

Guys I'm about to go to sleep and I need advice, what should I do next. Should I go tomorrow or not?
