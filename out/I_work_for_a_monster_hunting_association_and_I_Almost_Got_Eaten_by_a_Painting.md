I’ve seen my share of weird things working for the Association, but nothing—and I mean nothing—prepared me for what I encountered on the containment floor.

Now, before you get any ideas, no, I’m not a Warden. I don’t have their fancy training, cool gear, or fancy Aspects to face down an Aberration. I’m what they call a Cleaner. My job? Everything the Wardens don’t want to deal with. That could mean mopping floors soaked with things you’d rather not think about, or hauling cursed junk back to containment.

It’s not glamorous. The hours are hell, and sometimes I wonder if hazard pay is worth the nightmares. But it pays the bills, and I haven’t been eaten yet—so there’s that.

Now, before you start thinking about sending in an application—don’t. Seriously, you don’t want this job. Besides, the only way you end up here is if the Association decides you’re "useful." And if they think you’re useful, you’ve probably already seen or done something you can’t unsee. So take my advice: stay blissfully ignorant

Anyway, back to the story. My shift started like any other—assuming your idea of "normal" involves working in a containment facility that houses the nastiest Aberrations ever captured. Fortunately, there aren't many, as most Aberrations don't survive their encounters with Wardens. That makes the ones imprisoned here the exceptions—and definitely not the good kind.

The floor itself is buried deep underground, the kind of place where natural light has never existed. The air is stale, thick, and cold in a way that seems to seep into your bones. The fluorescent lights hum constantly, a faint buzz that worms its way under your skin. Reinforced cells line the walls, each one holding something that shouldn’t exist. I never linger near them. Experience has taught me that curiosity here is a death wish.

At the far end of the floor is the storage room for artifacts. It’s a cramped, windowless space packed with shelves of old books, rusty tools, and other unassuming objects. But nothing in there is harmless. 

You see, some Aberrations don’t just harm people—they leave their mark on objects, too. A scratch, a drop of blood, or even just being too close for too long can turn something ordinary—a mirror, a necklace, even a child’s toy—into something dangerous. And the worst part? The danger isn’t flashy or obvious. These curses are subtle, creeping up on you in ways you don’t notice until it’s too late.

That night, my task was simple: catalog items from the latest outing. I’d done it a hundred times before. Routine. Or so I thought.

I moved through the inventory, ticking off items on my checklist. But one piece caught my attention—a painting. It wasn’t listed on the manifest, which was strange because the Association is obsessive about tracking everything.

At first glance, it seemed unremarkable. Just a portrait, the kind you’d see in a stuffy old mansion trying to look historic. A man in old hunting gear stood beside a dog, both posed and proud.

But the longer I looked, the more something about it felt... wrong.

It  wasn’t the brushstrokes or the composition—it was the eyes. The man’s eyes didn’t belong in the painting. They weren’t dull or flat like you’d expect. They were sharp. Too sharp. They followed me, not in the usual "trick of the light" way, but deliberately. Intentionally.

I tried to shake it off. I'd seen enough cursed junk to know how easily your mind can play tricks on you when you're tired. I convinced myself it was just bad lighting and went back to cataloging

And then I heard it.

At first, it was faint, like wind slipping through a crack in the wall. But it wasn’t wind.

“Adam...”

I froze.

The sound wasn’t coming from the room. It wasn’t coming from anywhere. It was inside me, curling around my thoughts like smoke.

I glanced at the painting. It hadn’t moved—not exactly—but something about it was... heavier. The air around it seemed thicker, pressing against my skin.

The whisper came again, clearer this time.

“Adam...”

My chest tightened. I told myself it was just in my head. Stress. Overwork. Sleep deprivation. But deep down, I knew better.

“Come closer.”

I didn’t want to move, but my body didn’t care. My legs dragged me forward, step by reluctant step, toward the painting. I tried to fight it, but the harder I resisted, the stronger the pull became.

“Come closer,” the voice whispered, almost teasing. “You’ve been looking for me, haven’t you?”

"I definitely wasn’t," I thought, every instinct screaming at me to get the hell out of there. Too bad my legs weren’t listening.

Before I knew it, I was standing in front of the painting, my hand hovering over the glass. My fingertips brushed the surface, and the cold shot through me like an electric shock. I pulled back, but not before seeing the the eyes in the painting shifting. They moved. Not like before, when they seemed to follow me. This time, they turned—actually turned—away from me and toward the dog.

I hadn’t paid much attention to the dog before. Now I wished I hadn’t looked.

Its mouth, once a neutral line, stretched into a grin—too wide, too human. And the teeth inside? They weren’t a dog’s teeth. They were jagged, irregular, like shards of bone shoved into its gums.

“Adam...”

The voice wasn’t a whisper anymore. It was a growl, deep and guttural, vibrating in my chest.

The edges of the room blurred, the walls bending and twisting like they weren’t solid anymore. The pull intensified, and I felt my hand touch the glass.

The surface wasn’t cold this time—it was warm. Pulsing. Breathing.

The man in the painting moved. His lips parted, and a voice rasped out—not from the air, but from deep inside my mind.

“You’re mine now.”

The dog moved next. Its jaw stretched wider than should have been possible, that human grin splitting its face like a wound. Its eyes—once painted dots—were now alive, gleaming with a predatory hunger.

“Join us,” it growled.

I couldn’t breathe. The air pressed down on me, heavy and suffocating. My vision dimmed, and I felt something wrap around me—something cold and invisible, pulling me toward the canvas.

My hand brushed against my belt, and I felt the small iron pry tool clipped there. It was a simple tool, nothing special, but in that moment, it felt like a lifeline.

With every ounce of strength I had left, I flung it at the painting.

The moment it hit the surface, the room exploded with sound.

The painting screamed—not a human scream, but a howl, raw and unearthly, like a thousand voices crying out in agony. The man and the dog twisted and writhed, their forms melting into something grotesque.

The walls shuddered violently, groaning as if they were alive. The air burned, thick with the stench of rot and decay. I couldn’t see. My eyes burned, and I squeezed them shut, the nightmare raging around me.

And then—silence.

When I opened my eyes, the room was still.

The painting... it wasn’t a painting anymore. The proud hunter and his grotesque dog were gone, replaced by a scorched, streaked canvas. The frame itself was cracked and blackened, and the air around it felt thinner, like whatever had been there was finally gone—or at least hiding.

But the whispers... they didn’t stop. They were faint now, just barely there, like distant echoes slipping through the cracks of my mind.

I didn’t wait. I bolted from the room and called the Wardens.

When they arrived, I told them everything. They listened, their faces grim, and when they spoke, their voices were laced with unease.

The painting had been tainted by a shuck—a dog-like Aberration infamous for its ability to bind its essence to objects. The blood it spilled had seeped into the canvas, corrupting it entirely. The man in the portrait was nothing more than a façade, a distraction meant to mask the true danger. The shuck itself had been lurking in the background, a predator waiting for the right moment to strike. It wasn’t strong enough to manifest on its own, not yet. That’s why it needed me—my presence, my mind, my life force. It was trying to drag me into its twisted world, to use me as the final piece to regain its strength.

The iron I threw burned it, severing its connection to the painting and forcing it to flee. In its weakened state, the Wardens believed it might fade out of existence—but they couldn’t be certain.

As for the room, it was sealed and warded. It would never be safe again, but at least the contamination wouldn’t spread.  
The painting? I don’t know what they did with it. Locked it away, destroyed it—maybe both. I didn’t ask, and I didn’t want to know.

What I do know is this: not everything that seems harmless is. Not all paintings are just paintings. And not all nightmares stay locked away in your head. Sometimes, they find ways out.
