Hey, everyone. I’ve been going through something unsettling for the last few months, and I’m hoping sharing it might help me make sense of it.

It started after an exhausting week at work. I was so worn out that I fell asleep the moment my head hit the pillow, only to wake up in a dream that felt too real to be just a figment of my imagination. I found myself back in my childhood home, surrounded by familiar sights—the faded wallpaper, the scent of my mom’s cooking, and my toys scattered around. It felt safe and warm, like a hug from my past.

But the next night, I was back there again. At first, I thought it was just nostalgia, but soon I noticed things weren’t quite right. Shadows moved outside the window, and the neighborhood looked distorted, like a funhouse mirror version of my memories. I felt a creeping unease but brushed it off.

Then the dreams kept coming, night after night. Each time I fell asleep, I returned to that house, but the atmosphere grew darker. The laughter that once filled the air turned to silence. I began seeing a figure outside my window—a tall man with hollow eyes and a twisted grin. I tried to run, but every time I turned away, I would wake up in a panic, only to find myself back in that same dream.

Desperate for answers, I turned to the internet and discovered something called “dream loops.” People shared their experiences of being trapped in repetitive dreams, unable to escape. The advice was clear: confront the fear holding you captive. So, that night, I resolved to face the man watching me from the shadows.

I ventured through the increasingly sinister house, my heart pounding in my chest. Every creak of the floorboards made me jump. Finally, I confronted him. He turned slowly, that same twisted smile plastered on his face. “You can’t escape,” he whispered, his voice rough and gravelly. “You belong to me now.”

Panic surged through me as I bolted from the house, racing through the distorted streets of my dream. No matter how far I ran, I always ended up back on the porch, him waiting, eyes dark and hungry.

Weeks dragged on, and I fell into a horrifying cycle. I stopped sleeping, terrified of what awaited me in the dream world. My waking life blurred; I became irritable and exhausted. My coworkers commented on my dark circles, but I couldn’t bring myself to explain. It felt too insane.

Then, one night, after another grueling day, I fell into a deep sleep and found myself in that empty field again, surrounded by chilling silence. I called out, challenging the darkness, demanding to know what he wanted from me.

When he emerged from the shadows, he looked even more monstrous. “You think you can break free?” he taunted. “You’re stuck here because you can’t let go of the past.”

At that moment, everything clicked. My own regrets and fears were binding me to this nightmare. With this realization, the ground shook, and the dreamscape began to dissolve. I felt a glimmer of hope—but just as quickly, he lunged at me.

I jolted awake in a cold sweat, staring at the clock. Same time. I had escaped… or so I thought. The next night, the house reappeared, the man waiting, that twisted smile never leaving his face.

I finally understood that I wasn’t just dreaming; I was trapped in my own subconscious, forced to confront my fears and regrets on an endless loop. No matter how hard I fought, I could never truly wake up.

Now, every time I fall asleep, I brace myself for the nightmare, wondering if this will be the time I finally break free or if I’m doomed to wander those haunted streets forever. The man with the hollow eyes is always there, waiting, reminding me that the scariest nightmares are often the ones we create ourselves.

So, if you ever find yourself dreaming of your past, be careful. You might just meet him, too.
