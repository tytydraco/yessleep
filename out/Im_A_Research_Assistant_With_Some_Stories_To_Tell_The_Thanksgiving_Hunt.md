&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I hope you’re all having a pleasant November. I  thought I would check up. I know Turkey Day is right around the corner and I got plans. I don’t have any Ludus updates weirdly enough. On the one hand, I’m kind of glad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On the other, I feel like it’s planning something. My friends think I should be glad I don't need to deal with it for now. Maybe they're right. Well, since it's November I think it's an appropriate time to relay a mission I had around Thanksgiving. It was a year after the whole vampire fiasco so I was thirteen at the time.

&#x200B;

I was in school, only assisting Dean on missions occasionally. That way I could have something at least somewhat resembling a social life growing up. It was the first day of Fall break and man did I need it. Schoolwork for me wasn't an issue. However, between it and the training I was doing for the facility, I was exhausted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My plans for the next few days involved either my bed and book or marathoning some games or movies. I'd talked to Sheila and she told me that her family was going to be hosting. As for me, it was just going to be Dean and I or so I thought. He knocked on my bathroom door while I was still showering.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Zane, we need to talk. Hurry up."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instantly, my stomach knotted. I already had an idea of what this would be about, but I hoped I was wrong. I finished getting ready for the day and then headed downstairs. In the kitchen, Dean was already waiting with two plates of eggs, toast, bacon, an apple, coffee for him, and some OJ for me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Thanks," I told him and sat down.

&#x200B;

"No problem. Now, I'm sure you already know what we need to discuss."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I groaned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What's our mission?"

&#x200B;

"Oh, It's not for us, well, not for me anyway."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Confusion doesn't help apprehension.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I can't go on a mission by myself."

&#x200B;

"You aren't. You'll be partnered with someone else."

&#x200B;

"But it's Thanksgiving break. Why do I have to do it?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean shrugged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That's just how these things go sometimes. With any luck, you'll be done before the holiday."

&#x200B;

"Great, so who am I going with?"

&#x200B;

"Stella."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'd only met her a handful of times. She and Mickey helped new agents in the shooting range. I didn't know her that well on a personal level. What I did know is that like Mickey, she had an affinity for guns. That made me feel a little better. Chances are whatever we'd be facing, she'd have something to blast it away with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Oh, I like her," I said.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, she's fun, but just remember this will be no game."

&#x200B;

"I know. When am I going with her?"

&#x200B;

"A few hours so pack fast."

&#x200B;

"What's the mission?"

&#x200B;

"Only she knows, sorry."

&#x200B;

"Okay, so what are you going to be doing?"

&#x200B;

"I have some other business to take care of."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After breakfast, I packed everything I thought I would need including certain repellents from popular folklore, dreamcatchers, specific plants, and things of that nature. We're also taught certain incantations to help ward off hexes. I was coming out of my room with my suitcase full when there was loud honking outside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That would be her," Dean said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We went out to see a large RV in front of the house. Dean whistled.

&#x200B;

"Look at the size of that."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stella came out, greeting us. She and Dean shook hands, then she turned to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So, Zane, are you all ready to go?"

&#x200B;

"I guess. What are we doing exactly?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She gave a mischievous smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'll tell you after we're on the road.  Speaking of, we need to get a move on."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She went back into the RV

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, see ya," I told Dean.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, later, and be careful, Zane."

&#x200B;

"Don't worry. I will."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In addition to being big enough to transfer a baby elephant, Stella's RV had all the bells and whistles. I began to think this may not be so stressful after all. I know it seems like all my missions are life or death. In actuality, a lot are fairly benign. They usually involve us trying to lift some curse or deal with a minor entity.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this particular one would be my most dangerous yet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So what's this all about?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her one-word response erased all the optimism I had. To give a hint of what she said, it had to do with a certain Native American spirit that's strongly attracted to cannibalism.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Pardon my French, but is the facility fucking insane?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"Language, and besides, you've dealt with vampires, right?"

&#x200B;

"They have a bunch of different weaknesses. These are way harder to kill."

&#x200B;

"If the facility didn't trust you, they wouldn't be having you do this."

&#x200B;

"Well, hopefully, we don't end up on an early Thanksgiving menu."

&#x200B;

"That's the spirit. Now, let me give you a rundown of things."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The place we were heading to was Oregon. There had been some sightings in a remote town followed by attacks only weeks later. We weren't sure of the amount we were dealing with, only that there were several of them. Although I was nervous, spending time with Stella was pretty cool. Her RV even had cable, Wi-Fi, and some games and movies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was playing some Ratchet and Clank when my phone buzzed. It was a text from  Sheila, asking if I was up to Skype.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Do you mind if I take this?" I asked Stella.

&#x200B;

"Knock yourself out."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I got onto Skype and video-called Sheila. I was met with her smiling at me and waving.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, Zane," she exclaimed. "What are you up to?"

&#x200B;

"Riding in an RV."

&#x200B;

"You're fucking with me."

&#x200B;

"Nope."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I showed her the interior. Her mouth fell open.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Lucky, what's the occasion?"

&#x200B;

"I'm going on a hunting trip with a friend of Dean's."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I showed her Stella driving, who smiled and introduced herself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm so jealous. I'd give anything to switch places with you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If she knew what we were dealing with, I have a strong feeling she would be reconsidering her wishes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It can't be that bad where you are. Can it?"

&#x200B;

"My mom's in "Everything has to be perfect" mode and my dad's mentally preparing to deal with my grandparents. They nearly bit my head off for leaving a cup in the sink."

&#x200B;

"That sucks."

&#x200B;

"Yeah, I might see if I can slip away and spend time with my other friends."

&#x200B;

"Right, well, I should get going."

&#x200B;

"Same, I'll catch you later."

&#x200B;

"Yeah, take care."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The rest of the road trip was mostly spent in silence other than Stella honking and cursing at shitty drivers. After a day, we arrived at our destination later in the afternoon. It was out in a remote farmland. It was the kind of place where neighbors were miles apart,  cornfields were as far as the eye could see, and the nearest town was an hour’s drive away.  Stella parked the RV just off the road.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She got out, taking a breath and sighing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Nothing like that country air, right, Zane?”

&#x200B;

“Well, it beats the smells in cities. I bet you’re feeling at home.”

&#x200B;

“You got that right.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Glancing around, I saw some cows and horses grazing together. One looked at me with a mouthful of grass and let out a moo.  Some of the horses also seemed to be observing me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think they like you.”

&#x200B;

“What makes you say that?”

&#x200B;

“It’s just something you can tell if you’ve grown up around these kinds of places.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We made our way to the house and knocked on the door.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Quiet down," we heard a man's voice shout.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The door was opened by a gruff man, the kind of person with hands like leather who is built from years of farm work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You must be the help. The name's Ira. pleased to meet you."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He stuck out his hand and we shook it, introducing ourselves.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, Ira, since I'm sure we both want this cleared up before Thanksgiving, why don't we cut to the chase?" Stella asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ira nodded and invited us in. We followed him. We were also introduced to his wife, Leanne, and his daughter, Paulette. Leanne also had a tough physique and yet there was also a distinct layer of hospitality.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Can I get you anything?" she offered.

&#x200B;

"No, thank you. That won't be necessary," Stella replied.

&#x200B;

"Are you sure? The coffee's still warm."

&#x200B;

"I'm sure. I already had a cup earlier."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Leanne turned to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What about you? I got some cocoa heating up on the stove."

&#x200B;

"Yeah, that sounds good thank you."

&#x200B;

"Coming right up. Paulette, poor Zane a cup, will you?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edmund gestured for me to come with him. In the kitchen, she served me my drink in a festive orange and yellow leaf mug. The moment it touched my lips I felt rejuvenated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"This is amazing. What's in it?"

&#x200B;

"Family secret. Hey, have you ever been on a farm before?"

&#x200B;

"A few, but this one has a lot going on."

&#x200B;

"Mind if I show you around?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought I should be in the dining room to hear what Ira had to say. Then I considered knowing the layout of the area could be beneficial. Besides, Stella could relay everything to me. Paulette called for her mother, letting her know we'd be outside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We don't get many kids my age visiting. It gets boring, ya know?"

&#x200B;

"Yeah, I get what you mean."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While we chatted she showed me the pig pens. There was one a few years old whose fur was a vibrant white with a brown patch around its left eye. Its right ear was the same color.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It kind of reminds me of Wishbone."

&#x200B;

"Funny you mention him. That's his name."

&#x200B;

"You've read the books too?"

&#x200B;

"Everyone I could get my hands on. Wishbone here was going to be one of the pigs my dad put down, but I convinced him not to."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Wishbone who previously was sleeping, stirred. He noticed me and trotted over to the fence. Paulette was about to undo the lock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Is that safe?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"Don't worry. He's friendly. I trained him myself."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She unlocked the gate while shouting at the other pigs to stay. Wishbone came out and sniffed me curiously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"He likes you," Paulette chuckled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She reached into a burlap and pulled out an apple.

&#x200B;

"Catch."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She tossed it to me. I caught it. Wishbone stared at me expectantly. I held the fruit in front of him and he graciously gobbled it up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You can pet him."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave his head a rub and he squealed happily.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So, do you know anything about what's been going on?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette's cheerful demeanor dropped. She coaxed Wishbone back into the pen. Once in, he flopped over and went back to sleep.  Then Paulette turned to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is there somewhere a bit more private we can talk?”

&#x200B;

“Aren’t we the only ones out here?”

&#x200B;

“My dad has a bad habit of  accidentally sneaking up on people.”

&#x200B;

“Okay, have you ever been in an RV?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Later, we were inside it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Cool,” Paulette said, “how fast does it go?”

&#x200B;

“Like sixty I think, do you want a snack or anything?”

&#x200B;

“Do you have any root beer?”

&#x200B;

“Help yourself.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She got an IBC from the fridge and twisted the cap off. My coca was cool by then so I microwaved it for a minute.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What did you want to tell me?” I asked and took a sip.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even out of the microwave it was still incredible. She went over to one of the windows and peeked out. I peered past her, still only seeing rows of corn stock with the trees far off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is there anything in particular we’re supposed to be looking at?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette seemed to be lost in thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Paulette?”

&#x200B;

“What? Oh, sorry, I was just trying to see if…Nevermind. Can you keep a secret?”

&#x200B;

“I guess. What is it?”

&#x200B;

“Me and my friends saw something while we were out camping Labor Day Weekend.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

One issue with this job is you have to keep secrets. It's not strictly due to a "people aren't ready for this" kind of rule. No, it's for the "do everything themselves" people. Take vampires for example. They have a plethora of weaknesses to exploit and yet they claim countless victims each year, even seasoned monster hunters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In short, knowing your enemy's weaknesses doesn't help if they know you know it. The key is to keep in mind that they know that. In this case, I couldn't tell Paulette what we were after and what she probably saw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What was it?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"I'm not sure. It was too dark to tell, but it was shaped like a really thin person and it had antlers coming out of its head. Are you alright?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced down and noticed my hand was trembling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Yeah, it just sounds scary is all."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was an understatement. For those familiar with the legend, they know how people get possessed by these spirits. The kind they change into is dependent on different circumstances. The ones who turn into the pale bald ones became that way out of desperation. Think, being stuck in the forest with absolutely nothing else to eat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Other times, someone can be possessed by being bitten by one in a dream. Although, this one is rare. The antlered ones, however, occur when someone with overt greed is possessed. If you know anything about those kinds of people is that their hunger knows no bounds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Where exactly did you see it?"

&#x200B;

"There's a path a couple hours from here between the stalks. It's kind of hidden and used mostly by the loading trucks, but it leads to this great spot. At least, it did."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette's grip on her bottle tightened.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Listen, I know this is difficult, but anything you can share will help us."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She nodded and proceeded to explain her encounter.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We were supposed to have it to ourselves since not many people outside town know about it."

&#x200B;

"What about hunters?"

&#x200B;

"There's better places for that near the same area. Where we went is more scenic. You know, nature trails, streams, things like that. Anyway, on our first day there we heard gunshots."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette and her friends didn't think much of it, figuring as long as the hunters didn't wander too close, it wouldn't be a problem. On their second night, the incident took place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I was the first one to see it.  The fire was starting to dwindle so I offered to grab some more wood. I saw it by the stream. Jesus, it was tall."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette stared at me, her hands now shaking violently.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Zane, it was eating someone."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I tried my best to be reassuring.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, it's alright. It's why we're here. Can you tell me how big it was?"

&#x200B;

"At least a few heads taller than either of us. I almost got us killed. It was dark and I accidentally stepped on a twig. I'm telling you the second and I mean the literal second I did, that thing was after me. That scream, it was like tearing steel."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette told me she ran back to the campsite, screaming her head off. Luckily, her friends still had their wits about them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I think it was the fire that saved us. It was afraid of it."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The oldest among them, Lisa, lit a branch and used it to wave away their assailant.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

'Then we left. We didn't even bother packing."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a distinct chill in the air.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm guessing you haven't told anyone about this."

&#x200B;

"No, we figured someone else would come across it. We all swore to never tell anyone. I mean, we didn't think anyone would believe what we saw. They'd probably think we were drinking or something.”

&#x200B;

“Were you?”

&#x200B;

“I’m thirteen. Okay, I may have sipped a little beer. I know what I saw, though. If my dad ever found out what happened he’d never let me out of his sight.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I modded in understanding.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Was that the last you saw of it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette fidgeted with her hands.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“ I don't know. I hope. Sometimes, I think I can hear it at night. Maybe it’s my mind playing tricks on me. I’ve also been having these nightmares.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart sank.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Nightmares?”

&#x200B;

“Yes,  in them,  I’m back in the woods except I’m all alone with that thing. I always manage to wake up before it can bite me.”

&#x200B;

“Paulette, how long have you been having these dreams?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She stared into my eyes as if trying to pry my mind.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Why do you want to know?”

&#x200B;

“Does the dream play out the same?”

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

“Does it all happen the same? This is important.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Paulette was deep in thought, trying to recall. Then her eyes widened.

&#x200B;

“It’s closer. Now that I think about it, each time it starts closer to me.  I’m pretty sure I know what it is.”

&#x200B;

“You do?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I read about them once, but I never thought they could be real. You know something about it. Don’t you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I needed to tread carefully. I took another sip of cocoa before answering.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can’t say much, but we do have something here that might help you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I rummaged through her things and came out with a dream catcher. I handed it to Paulette.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s made with real silver. Hang it next to your bed when you sleep. It should help.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She flipped it over in her hands, examining it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can I keep it?”

&#x200B;

“For now.”

&#x200B;

“Thank you, Zane.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I gave her a nod and turned to the window. The sun was on the cusp of setting. I could see the colored leaves blowing in the wind.  The cold was back and the shiver that ran through my body told me that if we weren’t careful, we wouldn’t [have](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) a [Thanksgiving.](https://www.threads.net/@rose_black2222)
