I am from India. In my youth (I am 50 now), i have had certain incidents that sparked an interest in the paranormal / supernatural. I have become an avid collector of such stories / experiences. Below is such an experience. i had posted the same experience on a ghost stories website, leaving it as a Paranormal story, without any sort of explanation.

English is NOT my native language. Please pardon the language usage.

After graduating from my engineering college in 1995, I landed an engineering job with a company belonging to the Tata group. (Tata group is one the leading business houses in India.)

For a while, I was posted at the Company HQ at Hyderabad, in the then state of Andhra Pradesh (no longer a single state since it is now split into two - Telengana and Seemandhra).

Sometime later I was posted as a replacement engineer for a colleague based in the city of Jamshedpur, while he was on vacation. My work seemed to have pleased my Project Manager very much that he requested the Deputy General Manager (I was working as his assistant) to transfer me to Jamshedpur. I was initially against the transfer but relented when the DGM got angry.

So, I was off to Jamshedpur. Since I had a few friends in Jamshedpur (seniors and juniors from my college), I wasn't feeling any lack of company. Though it was hard work, the evenings were free. Being a bachelor, I didn't have much to do then. I would get off work at around 6.30 PM, travel with the company driver to a fast food joint, grab some chow-mein or fried rice, grab 2 beers from the liquor shop close by and be off to my flat.

The flat was actually the 1st floor of a 2-storied building, the ground floor occupied by the landlord and the upper floor leased to my company. It was a standalone building, quite far away from other buildings. There were no occupied buildings in the near vicinity. The nearest building was about 500 meters away.

The flat was fully furnished and stocked with all groceries by the company on a weekly basis. But I didn't know any cooking except to make a cup of coffee or tea. An office boy visited once a week to clean the flat.

My flat was usually a meeting point for bachelor engineers of my company. We used to get together on weekends and have a great time. We used to rent VHS movies and watch them at the flat over drinks and food.

One Friday night, my colleagues and fellow bachelors Deb, Hussain & Manish all got together and were having a nice time. After having around 3 beers, I was feeling slightly inebriated by then. Suddenly, I wanted to smoke badly, but since some of my friends didn't like smoking, I usually went outside on the balcony to smoke. It was around 10. 30 pm. It was a full moon night and the view from my balcony was wonderful. You could see the Subarnarekha river and the green foliage (back then, modernization was just encroaching on Jamshedpur, greenery was plenty then). Standing on the balcony of the 1st Floor, the whole road and parts of the sides were really visible.

My friend Deb (short for Debnarayan) had joined me and as we were smoking, we heard the cry of a baby. It was wailing. The sound appeared as if the baby was moving towards the building from the right. I was wondering who would be having a baby awake at such a time in the night. The sound approached the building and we could hear the wail at full. But, we couldn't see anyone - neither a baby nor anyone carrying a baby. It appeared as if the sound "halted" in front of the building and was not moving away. There was no baby crawling, there were no person or persons walking or even no persons carrying a baby. I could very well sense the sound of the wailing baby coming from the front of the gate. Plus, the landlord's family didn't have any babies, both their children being grownups living in the US A and no relatives had come to visit them (surely none with babies in tow), I am dead sure.

I got a little worried and told Deb that there is something disturbing since we can hear the baby's wail, but not see it. We decided to move in, locked the door to the balcony and settled down on the sofas with our two other friends who were discussing about "ghosts".

The tales that they were telling were quite gory & scary, making me disturbed. There was a loss of power and the lights went out, the fan stopped whirling and the TV/VCR went dead. My friend Hussain went to check the Electrical Distribution board to see if any circuit breakers had tripped. He came back in a few moments and said that the power failure could be external since all the breakers seemed normal. India's electricity distribution network is so much wanting. Power failures are a daily feature of our life.

So, we settled down again, with a single candle as the light. As we were just settling down, still discussing ghosts suddenly the candle went out. We were quite disturbed by the candle going out and suddenly, we could hear the wail of the baby, from the very living room we were in. It should be noted that we (Deb &me) had entered my flat from the balcony, I had locked the door from the inside!

Deb and I ran for our lives. We opened the door, leapt down the external stairs and out onto the road. Not knowing what was happening, but still sensing that something was wrong, Hussain and Maneesh also followed us.

We wouldn't go inside the flat. We were too scared. We told Hussain and Maneesh about the sound of the baby and they were spooked too. We heard the local Gurkha Guard/Night Watchman making his round and ran to him. We told him about the baby's wail. He looked at us, troubled, and told us that evil spirits would take all shapes and produce all sounds. He informed us that there have been many similar incidents in other areas close by. He informed us it would be best that we don't go back inside the flat. We sat with him in his small shed, waiting for the dawn and left for the city.

We inquired locally about the incident over the next few days. We heard tales about certain spirits which take the shape and imitate the sounds of many familiar objects, persons and animals, to attract people towards them.

I got my company to shift me to a flat in the city itself and vacated the flat the very next day!

2 weeks later, I went back to the house to collect some stuff I had forgotten there. We met the owners in their house on the ground floor. They were quite concerned about my sudden departure and enquired. With little shame and fear, I narrated the whole incident to the owner and his wife.

The owner's wife gave a very stern glare at her husband, got up, went into their bedroom, came out with a Pillow looking thingy and sat down.

She started squeezing/ Hugging the pillow thingy and suddenly, my blood froze upon hearing the sound.

It was the same sound as the baby's wail.

She asked me whether this was the sound I heard that night. I confirmed that it was.

It turned out that the pillow thingy was a toy pillow their grandchild who was living in the US bought with her when the owner's son's family came for their annual visit and had forgotten. The old man found the pillow very fascinating and once in a while would get it out of the cupboard and sleep while hugging it.

I said sheepish goodbyes to them and left.

The baby's wail we heard was the sound the pillow thingy was making when the old man was hugging it when he was sleeping. In my inebriated state, I thought that the sound was coming from the outside, while in reality, it was from the inside of the house.
