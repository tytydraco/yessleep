**911 Operator:** 911, what is your emergency?

**Rachel Fangade:** I – I, I’m not sure that I should even be calling, but I live in a pretty remote house and got really anxious.

**911 Operator:** Ma’am, it’s better to err on the side of caution. What caused you to call us tonight?

**Rachel Fangade:** It’s just that – I keep hearing a tapping from outside. It’s weird – it never comes from the same part of the house. So I went to check the windows to make sure they’re locked, and several of them had fingerprints on the outside of the glass. I know they’re not mine, and maybe the moonlight exaggerates them, but – something doesn’t feel right. I’m at 1913 [redacted] Street.

**911 Operator:** We’ve confirmed your location with a cell phone ping and a squad car is on its way. They’ll check things out and make sure your home is safe.

**Rachel Fangade:** Thank you. Really, thank you. I know it’s probably nothing, but it really means so-

*thumping noise*

**Rachel Fangade:** Oh, God. What was that?

**911 Operator:** Ma’am, are you all right?

**Rachel Fangade:** It came from in front of my house. Hang on, let me make sure that everything is locked up. *walking sounds* Oh my God.

**911 Operator:** What happened?

**Rachel Fangade:** *panicking* The front door is cracked open. I locked it two minutes ago, I triple-checked. What’s going on?

**911 Operator:** I’ve advised the squad car that it’s an elevated emergency and they’ll arrive shortly. 

**Rachel Fangade:** What do I do? *speaking faster* What do I do?

**911 Operator:** Can you safely exit the house?

**Rachel Fangade:** All I know is that he was just at the front door and I can’t see him. What if he’s waiting outside? 

**911 Operator:** I – I’m not sure…

**Rachel Fangade:** *screaming* Am I safer inside or outside?

*door slams*

**Rachel Fangade:** NO!

*running sounds*

**911 Operator:** Ma’am? Are you safe?

*heavy breathing*

**911 Operator:** The squad car has notified me that it’s almost at your house. It’s arriving without sirens or lights.

**Rachel Fangade:** *whispering* He’s in my house. *panting* I’m hiding under the kitchen table.

**911 Operator:** Okay, the squad car is pulling up to your home and will enter momentarily. 

**Rachel Fangade:** *hyperventilating* Is it human?

*inaudible conversation*

**911 Operator:** *whispering* Ma’am, the squad car has just informed me that it arrived at your address of 1913 [redacted] Street. There’s an issue.

**Rachel Fangade:** What’s wrong?

**911 Operator:** There’s no house at that address. They’re telling me that… they’re only seeing the charred remains of a burnt structure.

**Rachel Fangade:** WHAT? Are you sure they have the right address?

**911 Operator:** It’s… the exact location your phone is saying you’re located.

**Rachel Fangade:** *crying* I can hear him walking around my house. What the hell is wrong?

**911 Operator:** I’m trying to figure that out and I’m looking through everything that… what the hell?

**Rachel Fangade:** He’s getting closer. I think he’s on the ceiling.

**911 Operator:** This… my computer *and* my phone… the calendar on my desk – they all say it’s late on Friday night. 

**Rachel Fangade:** *panicked* It’s Thursday, but that doesn’t matter, is someone going to help me?

**911 Operator:** My computer says that all Thursday calls have ended. *distant chattering* I don’t understand… the squad car is telling me the same thing, and that they’ve found something in the charred remains of the house.

**Rachel Fangade:** *sobbing* I don’t understand.

**911 Operator:** *hyperventilating* It doesn’t make any sense. They’re saying that a charred skeleton is in the burnt rubble of the house, and that it’s missing a leg.

**Rachel Fangade:** He’s outside my kitchen door. There’s nowhere for me to run.

**911 Operator:** I can’t explain it. *muffled speaking* They’re sure of the address. They’ve called the coroner and won’t touch any more of the skeleton, other than to say it has a purple heart necklace melted against its skull.

**Rachel Fangade:** *very quietly* That’s my necklace.

*two minutes of loud noises that include breaking wood, loud screaming, tearing flesh, crying, spilling, and cracking noises*

**Rachel Fangade:** *low moaning* He’s gone.

**911 Operator:** Ma’am, are you okay?

**Rachel Fangade:** No.

**911 Operator:** What happened?

**Rachel Fangade:** *mumbling* He cut off my leg. I’ve never suffered so much pain. Please tell them to kill me.

**911 Operator:** I’m… I’m sorry. Officers haven’t been able to find anything at the address besides the… Your cell phone signal says that they’re standing at the place where you’re calling from. But they also say it’s Friday night. I’m so sorry, I can’t explain it. 

**Rachel Fangade:** How long will it take for me to die? I just want to stop the pain.

**911 Operator:** *starting to cry* I – I’m so… I don’t know.

**Rachel Fangade:** I figured it out. I turned on my stove, and the gas is making me sleepy.

**911 Operator:** No! 

**Rachel Fangade:** It’s the only way I can handle the pain. It doesn’t hurt as much when I breathe it in deeply.

**911 Operator:** I don’t know how to help you.

**Rachel Fangade:** What day is it?

**911 Operator:** Ma’am, please move away from the stove!

**Rachel Fangade:** It’s not working fast enough. That’s okay, I have a lighter in my pocket. The gas must have filled the room by now.

**911 Operator:** *crying* Please stop. I’ve never been this scared on a call.
