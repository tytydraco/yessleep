"Here we are – Dunn’s Creek!" Steve shouted as he, Dave, Tommy, and Lara stretched as they climbed out of the car and trudged along the deserted main street. "The fog is a bit weird, though, especially in the middle of August. But I guess it adds to the vibe." The houses lining the street to the left and right still appeared as if they hadn’t been abandoned for too long—maybe a few years. One could still sense how beautiful this place must have been once. The red sandstone buildings and the small log cabins with their protruding facades still had a touch of elegance and Western American romance, which in many modern cities had long become a relic of past days or mediocre Western movies. Overall, the town was in a remarkably well-preserved condition; only some boarded-up windows, rusted cars on the streets, and thorny vines and hedges that had crept over the sidewalks into the houses signaled that it had been quite some time since Dunn’s Creek was filled with life.

"Yeah, sure. Really picturesque here," Lara rolled her eyes. She had imagined something else for a relaxing weekend getaway. But Steve loved exploring lost places, just like his two friends Dave and Tommy, so it wasn’t a big surprise that they had taken a two-hour detour to search this admittedly rather interesting place, instead of heading straight to the lake. Lara, however, felt anything but comfortable in this ghost town. In the last two years, she had often accompanied her boyfriend to such places—abandoned towns and houses, deserted factories, empty hotels, dilapidated ruins, and crumbling mines. She often felt as though she shouldn’t be there, as if it were forbidden to visit these old places, or as if something was lurking, watching them the entire time. But perhaps it was exactly that which intrigued her boyfriend about exploring these places. "Come on," Tommy said, "this place is really cool. Just look at all these buildings. It’s like there was a thriving little town here just a few months ago."

The group continued walking along the main street. "Yeah," Lara replied, "but I still find it creepy. We don’t even know why the town was abandoned. What if dangerous gases are seeping up from the ground or something? Maybe this isn’t fog after all." The fog, the winding alleys, the forest, and the hills surrounding the town, not to mention the completely deserted streets, made Dunn’s Creek a creepy place, giving Lara a sense of unreality. She wrapped her arms around herself and followed the rest of the group.

"Look at that! Have you ever seen something like this?" Steve suddenly called out, pointing at the church tower about 50 meters ahead of them. Lara squinted her eyes to see what he meant through the light fog swirling around the tower. "The bell..." Steve added. Now Lara saw it too. "Strange..." she replied. "Maybe it’s broken?" The bell was moving inside the tower, as though it was ringing, yet there was no sound. "Oh no, how creepy, something’s broken in a ghost town!" Tommy’s voice was dripping with sarcasm. "Oh, shut up, you idiot," Steve retorted. Dave chuckled.

After a few more minutes of walking along the main street, they rounded a corner and came upon a beautiful two-story sandstone building, with a double-winged entrance leading up to it by a stone staircase. In front of the building was a small park with a once-lovely garden, now certainly overgrown, surrounded by a low, Gothic-style black iron fence. "The library," Lara said, nodding towards the sign in front of the building explaining its function. "It’s beautiful!" She took a few steps backward to get a better look at the building. "Shit!" she suddenly screamed, her heart skipping a beat. The others burst into laughter. She had walked backward into a small garden wall she hadn’t noticed, fallen onto it, and ended up sitting down. To avoid falling backward off the wall, she instinctively stretched her arms out to find something to hold onto. But there was already someone sitting on the wall. At least, that’s what she thought at first, as her hand landed on the shoulder of a statue someone had placed there.

"Fuck!" she shouted. "I almost had a heart attack! Who would put a damn statue on a garden wall?" As the others laughed, Lara looked more closely at the statue. Had she not been so startled, she might have been impressed by the level of detail. Whoever had crafted the lifelike bust was a master of their craft. The folds in the fabric, the individual hairs, the look of the man as he nervously glanced over his shoulder. The artist had painted the statue, and the paint still looked fresh, as though it had just dried, despite all the time it had been exposed to the elements. In another context, Lara, an art enthusiast and amateur painter, might have appreciated the statue, but here in Dunn’s Creek, it seemed creepy. "Can we please just go? I hate this place!" she asked, clearly annoyed. "Are you crazy?" Steve replied. "I was just about to suggest we check if the library’s locked. I wonder if there’s anything interesting inside." "You’re joking…" But the rest of the group enthusiastically agreed with Steve, so Lara resigned herself with a sigh. "Fine, but hurry up. I want to get to the lake already."

The friends walked through the small park in front of the library and up the sandstone steps. When they reached the door, they immediately noticed that it wasn’t locked—it was slightly ajar. "Well, would you look at that!" Dave exclaimed as he entered first. Lara shook her head, knowing there was no point in resisting. So, she followed Dave inside. The interior of the library was just as impressive as its exterior. High ceilings, rows upon rows of bookshelves, all filled with books. The ground floor had no ceiling; instead, the upper floor formed a ring around the central hall, supported by Corinthian-style sandstone columns. The floor was made of dark wood, and the room was flooded with light from the enormous windows, the sunbeams cutting through the dust particles swirling in the air. At night, the library was illuminated by three small chandeliers, which were now draped with cobwebs, symbolizing the time the building had stood empty. Tommy whistled in awe. "I guess we could spend hours exploring here!" "Not a chance!" Lara hissed. But even she couldn’t deny that the building was beautiful and she would have liked to browse around. It was just that the huge space radiated an eerie atmosphere, much like the rest of the small town.

After a few minutes of wandering, Dave’s voice echoed from the far end of the library. "Come here! I think I found something!" The rest of the group joined him. He was standing in front of a dark wooden desk, on which the remnants of an almost-burnt candle rested. Empty cans and water bottles were scattered around, along with a stained mattress and dozens of books piled up beside it. Dave held out a kind of leather folder to them. Lara read the inscription: "To the one who finds this manuscript."

"What’s this?" Steve asked. "Can’t you read? It’s a manuscript, you idiot," Tommy said. "I can see that, but what’s it supposed to say?" "Maybe it explains what happened to Dunn’s Creek?" Lara suggested. "I think someone would have found it by now, don’t you?" Dave replied. "I guess the only way to find out is by reading it," Steve said finally. "Give it here!"

He grabbed the manuscript from Dave’s hand and opened the folder. "Shit, someone really put a lot of effort into this. Look at this! Pictures of the houses and people here, newspaper clippings, and—what’s this?" He furrowed his brow. "A diary?"

"Come on, read it aloud!" Tommy urged. "Can we just go already?" Lara once again expressed her frustration. "Never, not before we find out what’s written in the mysterious manuscript in the eerie, abandoned library of the mysterious ghost town," Dave said, adopting a mysterious voice, holding his flashlight under his chin.

"Come on, Lara, we’ll read it quickly and then leave, promise!" Steve said. Lara sighed. She looked into her boyfriend’s eyes and saw how much fun he was having exploring this abandoned building and now holding this presumably historic and equally mysterious document. She sighed and gave in. "Alright, but hurry up." "You’re the best!" Steve beamed at her, kissed her, cleared his throat, and began reading:

 

**September 19**

Dunn's Creek was once a really nice little town located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The location of our small town, surrounded by hills to the north, east, and west, and situated on the banks of the river that gave the town its name, Dunn Creek, used to provide the atmosphere of a perfect small-town idyll. No matter where you looked, the views of the surrounding hills and the pine forests that climb the Rockies ensured that you never grew tired of the scenery, even after decades of seeing it. I’ve experienced a lot here, even though the town is quite far from other settlements and not much exciting happens here. I was born here, took my first steps, spoke my first words here. I spent my school years here and worked as a librarian for 20 years. I made many friends here, and even got married. My parents were born and died in Dunn’s Creek, as did many other good people. This is home to me. And now, I know I will die here. How exactly, I don’t know. No one knew when it was time. In the past few months, our cozy little community has turned into a place of fear and suffering, and now, I am the last one still alive here. Since all electronic devices have become useless due to recent events, I decided to leave a message for anyone who will one day visit Dunn’s Creek and wonder why and how a town like this could fall apart. To whoever finds this manuscript, I have attached my diary entries that describe everything that happened, what I know, and also what I don’t know.

The end of the town began in February with the first strange occurrences described in my diary. At that time, no one knew that everything would go downhill, because everything seemed as it always had.

For example, there was Eliot Mercer, the stocky owner of the grocery store. He had recently made it his mission to chase away three 17-year-old friends, Danny Wilkow, Randy Marshall, and Stanley Wittaker, from his store, because they had recently made it a habit to steal a few cans of beer when no one was looking, which they would then drink on the hills surrounding Dunn’s Creek. However, Eliot’s wife, Linda Mercer, always told him not to get so worked up, as she clearly remembered how he was at that age and advised him to let Sheriff Caldwell handle the matter. But Eliot, who had known the three boys since they were little, didn’t really want to get them into trouble. He was a hot-tempered man but of fundamentally good nature.

Clara Davenport, the teacher, was a warm-hearted woman who was adored by her students because of her knowledge and understanding manner. Even though she was almost 60 by now, she still went to school every morning with as much energy as ever. Ralph, the eight-year-old son of Martha and Lucas Finnigan, particularly liked Miss Davenport and would often talk to her, which she found highly amusing because of his admiration and imagination.

Aaron and Joanne Blake didn’t have much work during the winter, but their work as farmers in the quiet town was always highly appreciated. I liked them both very much. They were my neighbors, and Aaron went to school with me and was also my best friend. We met at least once a week at Joe Harrington’s bar, where we played pool and drank a few beers. Joanne was also good friends with my wife before she passed away eight years ago. We talked a lot about her afterward, and I think Joanne was almost as sad about her death as I was.

As usual, you could find Sylvia Klein jogging with Mayor Ruth McAllister every weekend, a tradition they had maintained for years and did every Sunday morning without fail. But this February, which was particularly cold and snowy, Sylvia had caught pneumonia, which the town doctor, Peter O'Donnell, treated. His wife, Evelyn, was the pharmacist and very good friends with Sylvia. So, she secretly slipped Sylvia a little bottle of gin to help her recovery.

Howard Granger, the grumpy owner of the rarely visited gas station, usually sat in a rocking chair in front of his shop, either dozing, drinking beer, or grumpily barking at people who dared to stop at his station to fuel up. I don’t remember anyone really liking Howard, not even his wife, Hannah. Only John Harper would occasionally be seen talking to the bearded old man, but that was probably because John drank as much as Howard did, and thus they were kindred spirits. Unfortunately, this was at the expense of John’s 16-year-old daughter, Maggie, who had problems with her father’s drinking and would often join Danny Wilkow, Randy Marshall, and Stanley Wittaker’s group out of loneliness and boredom, since they were about the same age.

Pastor Whitfield was one of the kindest people I’ve ever met. After my wife passed, he gave me much support and invited me to his home for meals so I wouldn’t be so lonely. His sermons at church were well thought out and delivered, with a tendency towards optimism and the cooperation of all Dunn’s Creek residents. And the people lived according to his sermons.

Until February, when the events began that destroyed everything. I am writing this at the desk in the library, where I’ve worked for over 20 years and haven’t left in the past few weeks. I know what the recent signs mean. The end has come for me. In less than two hours, I will be dead, assuming my assumption about what will happen to me is correct. But whoever reads these lines should form their own opinion about what we’ve experienced and make their own judgment. The reports, which I have shortened by a few irrelevant lines and entries, will be hard to believe, but they are true. I’ve attached the pages with the most important events, starting with my diary entry from February 12 of this year.

**February 12**

Today, Walt Grady came into the library. I’m relieved that the old man has recovered so well, as I thought he was done for. But he seemed pretty lively, although the cold was bothering him. He borrowed a book about the history of Ancient Rome, a topic he can’t stop talking about. I think he had a discussion with Nate Klein. The two always argue about something. Walt didn’t seem quite right, though, because he told me he saw a man on the northern hill of Dunn’s Creek, past Howard’s gas station, who just disappeared. I think his medication isn’t properly adjusted; he gave me a generally confused impression, and such hallucinations might indicate a wrong dosage. Maybe I should tell Dr. O’Donnell, in case Walt gets sick again.

**February 18**

Lucas Finnigan brought me the mail today. He told me that his kids, Ralph and Emily, had been keeping their mother busy, as they wanted to play in the snow all day. Ralph apparently can’t stop talking about Miss Davenport, who seems to have taken a liking to him as well. I think it’s because Ralph has such a big imagination, which Miss Davenport finds amusing. He also recently told me that he now has a second teacher, but no one else seems to know him.

**February 20**

Unfortunately, Walt seems to have gotten worse on his walk to the library last week, as his wife Jessica brought me the book back today. I asked about Walt, but it doesn’t seem to be going well for him—his pneumonia seems to have come back. He also seems to be getting a bit paranoid, complaining that he feels watched all the time. It’s sad to see a good old man like Walt so sick. I told Linda to talk to Dr. O’Connell about Walt’s medication dosage.

**March 2**

It seems even Walt’s best friend, Nate, is having trouble talking to him. Walt keeps confusing him with someone he’s terrified of. It’s very uncharacteristic of him, considering he used to hunt alone in the mountains for weeks and could always defend himself. The fact that he’s now having panic attacks every time he looks out the window isn’t helping the situation. Walt’s medication seems to be properly dosed. It must be hard for Nate to watch what’s happening to his friend. I can’t even imagine how it would feel if Aaron were to yell at me in confusion and fear. After all, I’ve known him for over 40 years.

**March 12**

I’ve been feeling a bit off lately whenever I go outside. A little worried. It’s not like there’s anything specific that’s bothering me, but I have this feeling like I should be looking over my shoulder more often, only to find no one behind me. But it’s been a long, hard winter, and people’s moods have generally been worse. The darkness doesn’t help either. The light fog that has been hanging over the town since Saturday isn’t making things better. It’s time for spring. The sun will lift our spirits.

**March 13**

Walt Grady has passed away. Helen Roscoe told me this morning when I walked past her hotel. It hit me hard, because I liked the old man and had hoped he’d recover and share his vast knowledge of history with me. But I guess it’s for the best—he had been getting weaker in recent months. Jessica will be devastated. According to Helen, Walt fought and screamed as it neared the end. He seemed to have been terrified. I hope he finds peace now.

**March 14**

Eliot Mercer yelled at Danny Wilkow and his two friends in the middle of the street today. They seemed to have broken a window of his store, but they claimed it wasn’t them. It was quite a heated situation, and Linda had a hard time calming her angry husband and getting him back into the store. Admittedly, the three boys had been acting up for a while. But I don’t think they would intentionally damage property. After all, Eliot had always given them candy when he saw them on their way back from school. I don’t know why the three would want to harm him, as they’re good boys, despite their rebellious phase. I don’t understand why Eliot’s dog, Rowdy, didn’t bark when someone was messing around his store…

**March 17**

John Harper and Howard Granger, our two town drunks, celebrated St. Patrick’s Day in full force. By celebrated, I mean they were loudly and obviously drunk, shouting at each other in front of Howard’s gas station, which turned into quite a spectacle that drew a small, curious crowd. The people, myself included, watched the argument and the altercation with a mixture of embarrassment and amusement, but I found it rather sad how far the two of them had fallen. I only half understood what it was about. John accused Howard of stalking his daughter Maggie. I don’t know why he suspected Howard, but apparently, Maggie really is afraid to go outside. According to John, she feels like she’s being watched ever since she and Danny Wilkow’s gang came back from one of the hills, where they had been drinking beer. Maggie claims she saw someone standing in the fog and since then, she’s felt watched.

I have to admit, I’ve been feeling uneasy more and more lately. I’m not sure where it’s coming from, but I’m definitely not going to start a scene in public. \[...\]

**March 20**

My unease is slowly growing. I can’t help but constantly glance over my shoulder. As I was walking home after work today, I thought I saw someone standing on the hill behind the Randall farm. It was already dusk, so I’m not sure if I just imagined it, and the persistent fog might have contributed. But anyway, I thought I saw someone standing there, but when I looked more closely, the silhouette was gone. I remember that Walt, before he died, had told me he had seen someone on one of the hills. Maybe I should ask Dr. O’Connell if he’s setting my medication correctly. Of course, he would first have to prescribe me something.

**March 25**

Something strange happened today. I’m actually at a loss for words to explain it properly, and it sounds ridiculous when you talk about it. It’s about Maggie Harper. She had been feeling unwell and followed. Since her father John had publicly accused the gas station attendant, her paranoia had only worsened. In recent days, she had hardly been seen outside, yet she still felt watched, as John explained to us. This afternoon, I heard excited voices in front of the library. I opened the window and looked out onto the street, and saw Maggie accompanied by Danny, Stanley, and Randy. Maggie was obviously upset and disturbed, and the three boys were discussing and gesturing animatedly. When I asked if everything was okay, they called me downstairs because it was “hard to explain.” When I got downstairs, I asked Maggie what was wrong. She had her hands pressed to her eyes, clearly frightened, and with a trembling voice, she managed to say just two words: “My shadow!”

At first, I didn’t know what she meant. The sun was already quite low at that time, and I looked behind me. My body cast a long shadow, just like the boys did. But when I counted again, I froze. There were only four shadows, but we were five people. Maggie’s shadow was missing! I don’t know how that’s possible, but it doesn’t seem right.

Maggie noticed I was speechless, and it clearly terrified her even more. She mentioned something about the man on the hill taking her shadow, and now it was her turn, and she ran quickly home.

**March 28**

\[…\] Maggie has been sick for days, according to John. She saw another silhouette on the hills, this time even two. The poor girl is completely done for, and her shadow still hasn’t returned. \[…\] Yesterday, Aaron told me that all his clocks in the house stopped at exactly 2:17 AM. He and Joanne are a bit confused about it. Not just one, but all of them! I’m starting to get confused too. It’s been a strange few weeks.

**April 2**

Martin Harlow, our mechanic, was a little strange today too. He’s usually a cheerful, funny person and always ready for a joke. When I ran into him, he seemed worried, glancing at the northern hill of Dunn’s Creek repeatedly during our small talk. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. When I asked if everything was okay, he just stared at me with a strange expression and walked off without saying another word. \[…\]

**April 19**

\[…\] Something is wrong here. The fog just won’t go away. More and more people are reporting one or two silhouettes in the fog on the hills. Tina Klein saw them yesterday, and George Larkin saw them today. The strange thing is, they don’t seem to do anything. If they’re strangers who’ve gotten lost and need help, why don’t they just come into the town and talk to someone? They just stand there in the fog, staring at people. If I hadn’t seen one of these silhouettes myself a few weeks ago, I’d be highly skeptical. And still, no one has been able to swear that someone was really standing there, because when you look closely, there’s no one.

Maggie obviously doesn’t speak anymore. She just sits by the window, staring out toward the hills, refusing meals. John had an argument with Danny, who apparently wanted to visit her. Maggie and the boy seem to have some sort of relationship, which John disapproves of. He told Danny that Maggie absolutely couldn’t have visitors, she was far too upset. \[…\]

**April 25**

Apparently, Jacob Miller’s cats have disappeared. Without a trace. All four of them. How can that happen? He lives next to the cemetery, of course, he’s the undertaker. But how likely is it that four animals would fall into open graves, as he assumes? Especially since there are no open graves, as no one has died. He reported seeing one of the figures in the fog between the gravestones the day before the cats disappeared. Who are these figures, and why don’t they show themselves? \[…\]

**April 29**

Maggie is gone! She wasn’t in her bed when John woke up this morning. He called Danny Wilkow, but he claimed he hadn’t seen Maggie in a week because John wouldn’t let him visit her. John stormed straight to Howard Granger’s gas station to confront him. Of course, Howard also claimed he hadn’t seen Maggie, but John wasn’t having it. When the situation started escalating, Sheriff Caldwell fortunately showed up to defuse the conflict. He took both John and Howard with him, and they’re now both at his station answering his questions. \[…\]

Postscript: I could swear I saw one of the silhouettes in the dark, standing behind the Blake’s farm, at the end of the field! So close to my house!

**May 3**

What’s going on here? I think we’re all losing our minds. In search of Maggie, various search teams have gone out to comb the area around the town. Lucas Finnigan, George Larkin, Marc Davenport, and Helen Roscoe planned to search the woods west of Dunn’s Creek. They drove down the road in George’s pickup truck, past the McLeods’ tailor shop. Behind the tailor shop, at the edge of town, they turned right onto the gravel road that leads to the water tower. But the road wasn’t there anymore! It was just gone. And I don’t mean that someone had removed the gravel and put in new soil. The road was gone, and grass and hedges had grown where it had been yesterday. Like it had never existed. Instead, a new path now led left, behind Garry Oak’s house, which was definitely not there before. Even Garry’s cherry tree was gone. I’m honestly not sure what to think anymore. \[…\]

I think after today, everyone in Dunn’s Creek realizes something’s wrong. People are tense. Maggie is still gone, and some feel it has something to do with one of the silhouettes. \[…\]

Aaron and Joanne were very quiet today. Of course, I told them I thought I saw one of the figures behind their field. They just nodded silently.

**May 9**

We’ve given up searching for Maggie. We’ve combed every place, but found no trace. John has been drinking more in the past few days and barely says anything anymore. The poor man has already been through enough in his life, and now his only child and last remaining family member has disappeared...

**May 12**

Since today, neither phones, televisions, radios, nor any other communication devices are working anymore. We are cut off from the outside world! We believe the figures have something to do with it, even though no one has ever seen them do anything other than stand and observe. People are seeing them more often now, often out of the corner of their eyes or in their peripheral vision. As soon as you look closer, they’re gone. They’ve also never been seen within the city limits, only on the hills and behind the Blake’s farm. There, they just stand, half-hidden in the fog.

We’ve planned a meeting at town hall tonight to discuss what to do next. I hope we can figure out how to get our old life back because right now, everyone is getting a little restless.

**May 13**

The meeting yesterday didn’t give us much except that we now have a better idea of the extent of what’s happening. Dozens of citizens, including the Finnigans and their children, the Harlows, old Nate Klein, Jessica Grady, Mayor McAllister, CJ Jameson, Mandy Glover, myself, and many others, have seen the figures in the last few weeks. Oddities like the disappearance of the road to the water tower were not isolated incidents. Just like with my neighbors, the Blakes, other households also had their clocks stop – all at 2:17. Leona Holt’s shadow disappeared just like Maggie Harper’s, as her students had shockingly noticed during the lunch break. Several animals, mostly cats and livestock from the two ranches, have simply disappeared without a trace, some from locked barns. Emory Knox, while working as an electrician at the Kirkland’s house, apparently had some sort of seizure a couple of days ago. The Kirklands said he stood motionless for exactly 17 minutes. Not a hair moved, not even a blink or breath. Emory was frozen in mid-sentence, mid-motion, and exactly 17 minutes later, thawed and finished his sentence as if nothing had happened. He has no memory of it.

Ralph and Emily Finnigan have been staring out the window toward the hills since yesterday, acting unusually quiet and apathetic. Lucas and Martha are scared for their children. When I think of how Maggie was before her disappearance, I would be scared too if I were in their shoes. \[…\]

Sam Barrows, who owns the fishing store near the school, has been talking a lot about conspiracies and government experiments. But no one really believes him, because nothing can be explained that way. \[…\]

Most of us now believe that the figures on the hills aren’t strangers looking for help. What (or rather, who) they are, no one can explain. It’s hard for me to believe that there are creatures out there that aren’t human, but no amount of thinking has provided any insight into what we’re dealing with. Despite the lingering skepticism of some citizens, we’ve concluded that we have to do something. But no one really knows what, because we don’t even know what’s happening...

**May 23**

\[…\] Ralph and Emily Finnigan haven’t stopped staring out the window, which is scaring their parents. Last night, they packed their things and left early this morning. They planned to head toward Washington to seek help and get their children to safety. I can’t blame them. This morning at 7 AM, I saw them leave as I was on my way to the library. They drove west, past the tailor’s shop and the now non-existent path.

What happened next makes me doubt whether we can change anything about the situation. Around 6 PM, the Finnigans were seen returning to Dunn’s Creek, coming from the east. I don’t know how it’s possible to drive west and then hours later come back from the opposite direction to the starting point. What makes it even stranger is what Lucas told me when I asked what had happened. They had driven normally along the road without turning. When leaving the town, Martha had seen two figures on the hills, so the Finnigans had stepped on the gas to get away from Dunn’s Creek as quickly as possible. But after 45 minutes, they simply drove back into the town from the opposite direction. After 45 minutes! This means, according to their account, that they must have re-entered the town by no later than 8 AM. But they were only seen again just after 6 PM! Ten hours later!

What happened during those ten hours, neither Lucas nor Martha could explain. Just like they couldn’t explain how they made it back to Dunn’s Creek. \[…\]

**May 30**

Now the Finnigans have all disappeared. Lucas, Martha, Emily, and Ralph. No sign of where they went. Since Lucas was the mailman and no one received their mail that morning, their disappearance was noticed quite quickly. But that doesn’t make it any less strange. Laura Harlow, Martha’s best friend, knocked on the door of the Finnigans’ house, but received no answer. She went to the back door and looked inside. What she saw didn’t make any sense, so she called Sheriff Caldwell for help, who gained access to the house.

All the beds were empty. The fridge was open. The water in the bathroom was running. A half-eaten toast sat on a plate, and milk was standing open beside a cup of coffee, which hadn’t been poured into it yet. All in all, it seemed like the Finnigans had vanished into thin air. At first, I thought maybe they had gone out of town again and made it this time. But their car was still in the driveway. No one saw them leave, not the Jacksons across the street nor Miss Miller, who always spies out the windows and never misses anything. Since no one saw them leave, we assume they were somehow abducted. We’ve formed search teams again to find the family. I’ll start searching in the northern part of town with Aaron and the pastor. The thought of going into the hills, where we often see the figures, doesn’t sit well with me, but we may have no choice. The Finnigans would do the same for us. \[…\]

I’ve started looking for literature in the library that might shed light on what’s happening here. So far, I haven’t found anything that matches the description of the silhouettes. But no one has really seen the beings to this day. They remain hidden in the peripheral field of vision, so you can’t look at them directly. They are almost like the fog in which they hide. I feel like they want us to know they’re there. But what their presence means, I can’t imagine.

**June 4**

No trace of the Finnigans. We’ve stopped searching again. Now five people are gone, including three children. People are slowly becoming suspicious and hardly leave their homes anymore. Rowdy, the Mercers’ dog, has now also disappeared. No trace, of course.

Clara Davenport claims to have seen one of the figures in the fog on the school roof. This would be the first time they’ve dared to come within the city limits. Miss Holt’s shadow still hasn’t returned. She has locked herself in her apartment for days and won’t open the door for anyone. When Eliot Mercer pressed his face against the window and peeked through a gap in the curtains into the Holts’ living room, he saw Miss Holt frantically scribbling and drawing symbols on the walls, although he couldn’t identify the symbols and writings.

My paranoia is getting worse too. Although I’ve only seen the figures a few times (Dave Calloway sees them almost every day now), I barely dare to walk home from the library alone. I pray every time I go outside that I still have a shadow.

**June 7**

They’ve taken Miss Holt. She has vanished without a trace. She was last seen by her students when she went into her office just before class began, but she never appeared again. Sheriff Caldwell gained access to her house and found almost every wall and ceiling smeared with strange symbols and markings. No one can say exactly what Miss Holt wrote. But I have a bad feeling that it might be a warning or something like that. \[…\]

Aaron told me earlier that Joanne no longer dares to look out the window. The fog is getting thicker, and she feels the two figures are standing there watching her. That thought sends a chill down my spine. I asked Aaron if we should sleep in one house together to keep each other company, but he didn’t seem too happy about the suggestion. \[…\]

Postscript: George Larkin hasn’t returned to his wife today, and no one has found him yet. That’s two people in one day who’ve disappeared without a trace, at least if I’m right in assuming that what happened to him is the same as what happened to Miss Holt and the others (which I believe). I don’t know what to think anymore. I’ve heard that CJ Jameson, Dave Calloway, and Martin Harlow plan to go out tomorrow and confront the figures on the hills. Of course, there have been some protests and discussions, but I think everyone realizes that we have to act if we want the situation to turn around. I pray the three of them return safely.

**June 8**

They didn’t return. Of course, they didn’t. Three men, just gone. We found their rifles at the foot of the northern hill, lined up against an old, crumbling wall of the adjacent cemetery. Next to them lay their clothes and shoes, neatly folded on the ground. There’s no trace of the three men. The figures watched us as we gathered CJ’s, Marc’s, and Dave’s belongings to return to their families. Searching is pointless. We won’t find them anyway. \[…\]
