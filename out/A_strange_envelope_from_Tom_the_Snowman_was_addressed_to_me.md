I received a strange letter. I remember it, too much if you ask me. The doorbell rang and I screamed like a pussy that night. My friends seemingly confused giggles and asked what was going on.

&#x200B;

I said that I was unsure myself and that I would go and check the door. I muted the discord call cutting one of my friend voice telling me to be careful. Before making my way to the front door, I stopped in the kitchen and took one of those fancy knife that my mother offered me last christmas.

&#x200B;

The sound of my footstep echoed throughout the house, my heart pounding hard making me feel like my chest would explode at any moment, my weight causing the wooden floor to squeak time to time.

&#x200B;

Destination was reached: The door was just in front of me. I swiftly opened the door and took a stab in the air. No one in sight. I looked left, looked right, only the streetlights and the moon laughing at me. Yes I know, that was stupid to do. Still, I felt unsafe. I looked down below and there it was.. the start of my misery: A strange letter with a circle on it. On both side, geometrical pattern. No address apart from mine and something was scribbled at the back. I took a step forward in front of me letting the streetlight gently caress the paper and highlighting the words.

&#x200B;

"From Tom The Snowman". I could not imagine who would send me that.. and to state the obvious no I did not know any Tom or Thomas. I opened the envelope and immediately laughed at the sheet itself.

&#x200B;

The sheet was filled with cryptic snowman emoji, well at least it looked like that. On the left, the happy and sad one. On the right the angry and.. whatever that smile is.

&#x200B;

I started to read the content:

&#x200B;

"Dear Frank, sadly you once again failed. How was it to take someone else life? How does it feel to have blood on your hands? Drunk driving was simply a starter for you. I am concerned, even if you are a monster. The trials you will be forced to face are inhumane. Just like what you did. Of course, I will not be the judge of your actions I am merely the messenger. You have a maximum of three days to prepare, after that your trials begins. The first one is situated at 44 Lampkin Street, first warehouse on the left, red bricks. The instructions will be on the DVD. I am sorry, truly. I hope you win sincerely.. you would be the first."

&#x200B;

\-Sadly yours

&#x200B;

Tom The Snowman.

My hands were tremblings, my eyes wet from the tears. How.. who... did he ..? I need to speak to my lawyer.

Who would have done a prank that horrible. I need a break, I need to find out who this person is and what the hell does he wants. He spoke about trials what did it means..? I will sleep today, tomorrow I will investigate the warehouse and find out who this psycho truly is.
