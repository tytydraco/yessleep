
My name is Amanda and I have always been interested in hairdressing for as long as can remember, I had an interesting Job offer last week from our local salon, I mean what better way to put some practice on my skill. 

But when I went there for an interview, I couldn’t help but notice that almost all their employees had no front teeth, from the lady at the reception, to the hairdressers to the cleaning staff. 

But there was one new employee who still had her front teeth, she had just begun her job that very same day, but I didn't think much of it at the time.

“You will begin next week Monday, Amanda! We sure excited to have you” ........

That was my new employer, I got introduced to everyone before leaving. Monday arrived, and I was excited to go to work, my boss was a busy guy he always locked himself up in his office or was always away.

As we were working, a guy wearing a black tuxedo holding a red briefcase came in, as he walked in through the door, the atmosphere felt like a storm just swooped in,

“Who is that?’ I asked....

“The boss’s business partner” one of the employees whispered to me

The guy went straight into the boss’s office, after an hour of being in there, he came out, but without the red briefcase.

The following morning when we came to work, the newly employed hairdresser that came in before me came to work but she had lost her front teeth.

“Weird”, I thought to myself ......

Not long after we arrived at work, the guy who came with the red briefcase came in again, but this time it looked like he came to fetch it as he left with it. 

This had me asking myself questions the whole day, but I thought I was overreacting.

I asked her what happened to her teeth, but she told me that they woke up gone and could not even see where they went.

 I mean how can your teeth come out and not even know where they fell but I thought maybe she partied hard the previous night.

A week passed, and honestly, I was starting to move away from thinking about what had happened to Lisa’s teeth. While we were working with clients, that guy came in again, same outfit and the same red briefcase.

Our eyes locked until he entered the boss’s office, I was honestly starting to get a weird feeling about this guy. And again, after exactly an hour, he came out of the boss’s office without the briefcase.

My mind couldn’t stop thinking about that guy and his briefcase, I had a sleepless night thinking about what exactly could be happening. The following morning one of the cleaning ladies greeted me, but her teeth looked decayed, I could have sworn that her teeth were normal just yesterday.

Her teeth looked like they were rotting, they looked brown, almost black, decaying. 

I knew that I was not hallucinating about this, something weird was going on in that salon but everyone seemed to think it’s nothing.

I could not help but notice that guy still has not fetched the briefcase, while I was thinking about that, he came in and exactly after an hour he came out with the briefcase. 

The following morning when we came in again, the cleaning lady had lost those front teeth that looked decayed yesterday.

That’s it, I made up my mind that I am going to resign from this job, I went straight to knock at the boss’s office but as I was about to Knock, that guy came in again with the red briefcase and I ended up not being able to talk to my boss as that guy suddenly arrived. 

I knew people losing their teeth had something to do with that guy and his red briefcase.

I know that my boss is using his employees' teeth for something, and I wanted to resign before my teeth were next. 

I mean whose teeth are next at this point? 

I went home without telling my boss that I wanted to quit, I thought that I would do it the following morning. 

But to my surprise that morning, I had lost all my front teeth when I woke up and I could not even see one of my teeth on where they fell.


I rushed to the salon covering my mouth with a mask to tell my boss that I quit but as I entered through the door, I met that guy as he just fetched that red briefcase, 

He came to fetch my teeth inside that briefcase.
