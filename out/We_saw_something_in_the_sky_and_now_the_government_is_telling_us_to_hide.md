It was supposed to be just another quiet night. My girlfriend and I were out walking our dog, the air biting cold against our faces. Everything felt still, like the calm that creeps in before a storm. The streets were empty, the world around us asleep. But as we walked, something made me glance up.

At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light. But no… no, it was real. A shape. Huge. Unfathomably large, hovering just beyond the atmosphere. My mind couldn’t fully process it at first. It was too big, too impossible. A man — or something shaped like one — floating above us, its form barely visible against the stars. But it was there. I could feel it, as much as I could see it. Made of stone, or something even older. Every inch of it cracked and weathered, as if it had existed for eons, far beyond human comprehension.

And the worst part? It was moving. Slowly, deliberately, toward Earth.

My girlfriend grabbed my arm, her breath caught in her throat, but before either of us could speak, our phones buzzed. The sharp sound of an emergency alert. Amber Alerts. We both checked at the same time, and my stomach dropped.

The message was terrifyingly direct:
“Evacuate. Now. Do NOT look at the sky. Do NOT attempt to take photos. Do NOT observe the entity. Seek shelter underground immediately.”

The entity. That thing.

My hands were shaking as I shoved the phone back into my pocket. The streets felt different now. There was a weight pressing down on us, like the very air was heavy with something dark. And as I stood there, frozen in place, I realized the low hum I was hearing wasn’t in my head. It was the sky itself… vibrating. Like the earth was groaning under the presence of whatever was up there.

Without saying a word, we ran. We didn’t stop to think, didn’t even bother to talk. We just sprinted, the dog pulling ahead as we made our way to the nearest building — an old school we knew had a basement. The door was wide open. No one cared about locking up anymore.

Inside, we weren’t alone. A handful of people had gathered in the basement, faces pale, eyes wide with terror. There was no comfort here, only shared fear. Whispers filled the space, echoing off the concrete walls. No one dared speak above a whisper. No one dared talk about what we had all seen.

But it was there. The warning echoed in every hurried conversation: Don’t look up. Don’t let it see you.

I can’t describe the dread that settled in me as we sat in that dark basement. The floor beneath us seemed to tremble, like something enormous was drawing closer. The sound… it’s still there. A deep, bone-rattling hum that won’t stop. I keep picturing that figure — so impossibly large, so distant yet close enough to swallow us whole. I don’t know what it is, but it’s getting closer.

And I’m terrified of what will happen when it finally reaches us.
