Part I: The Phone  
  
To begin with, I’ll be using fake names to keep anonymity. I’ll call myself Emma for the time being. I’m bringing all this back up because it was just so unbelievably strange. Most of my childhood is a blur but the things I do remember are things I’d rather not. But what I’m about to recount all happened when I was six and my younger sister, Amy, was five. We had recently moved from one shitty midwest town to another…it looked the same as our previous town…gray, drab, and lifeless…so the midwest. The only difference was that me and my sister were now uprooted from our neighbors and friends, and we essentially knew no one else aside from each other. I don’t remember having many real friends during this period of my life.  
  
To a six-year-old, moving to a new town was basically the end of the world. I distinctly remember being a little brat and being spitefully uncooperative. But as weeks passed by, I just sucked it up and got used to it. Our usual routine was wake up, eat breakfast, watch cartoons, head off to school, then come back home and play till bedtime. Me and my sister lived within walking distance of our school, so obviously we walked home together every day. However, one day, me and my sister got into an argument about something stupid…if I recall correctly, it was about Pokémon cards or something. I remember her saying she wasn’t going to walk home with me, and so being a dumb six-year-old…I just left her sitting on the sidewalk. I had made the biggest mistake of my life. Within 10 minutes of me getting back home, she walks in looking all happy like nothing was wrong with a lollipop in her mouth. Our mother didn’t really seem to pay attention to this detail at first until I excitedly asked where she got it from. My sister’s response didn’t ring as too strange to six-year-old me…but I could tell that my mother was now very interested.  
  
“Dr. Bonbon gave it to me”. Our mother looked very confused at first, but then she started to smile and asked about ‘Dr. Bonbon’.  
  
“So, Amy, who’s this Dr. Bonbon?”  
  
“He said he’s the doctor. He drives a big van, and he has all kinds of stuff at his house. He said he had puppies, candy, and a lot of toys. He’s nice too, he walked me home to make sure I was safe.”  
  
Looking back, I don’t blame my mom for chalking up ‘Dr. Bonbon’ as simply being an imaginary friend. I mean it was almost Halloween, so Amy could’ve easily just gotten the lollipop from school…and she was a five-year-old with an overactive imagination. And I don’t blame her…I mostly blame myself for leaving Amy there on the sidewalk…but I still wish she just questioned a little further. Because for the next seven years…’Dr. Bonbon’ put our family through an unending living hell. But the strangest part of all of this…is how he just came and went…as sudden as he appeared in our lives…he just disappeared.  
  
The first time I remember being worried about this ‘Dr. Bonbon’ was a few days after the lollipop incident. Amy had come into my room after bedtime, but she was crying profusely. She told me that Dr. Bonbon was throwing rocks at her window and calling to her…but he wouldn’t stop after telling him our mom would get mad. I was still under the impression that this Dr. Bonbon character was an imaginary friend. But I still let her sleep in my room because I felt bad for her. It’s just…as I was trying to fall back asleep…I heard what vaguely sounded like leaves crunching under my window. I froze in bed as this one question started pouring into my mind…” who was outside my window?’  
  
As a six-year-old, you don’t quite grasp the horrors this world is capable of producing…but you can still gather the concept that some people wanna do things worse than simple murder. I was made to realize this a bit sooner than most… since that whole night as Amy slept next to me…I heard rocks hit my window…as he called both of our names.  
  
This was just the beginning of the unimaginable seven years of hell we were forced to endure at his strange amusement. Pawns in his sick little game.   
  
I remember the next day telling my dad about this creepy encounter, but he dismissed it as the imagination of a child. But for the next few weeks, Amy always stayed behind because she wanted to walk home with ‘Dr. Bonbon’. And frankly, I wanted nothing to do with this person…so stupidly I would walk home by myself. Every day, Amy would come home smiling with a lollipop in her mouth…but every night she would come to my room crying…and I would be forced to endure a night without sleep as that creep threw pebbles at my window and whispered for us to come play with him. But every attempt to tell our parents about this would be shot down with “Dr. Bonbon is imaginary”.  
  
Eventually in November, my birthday rolled around. But this birthday would mark what I would come to call as “The Phone Incident”. We were just getting back from school, and I couldn’t wait to finally do my party since my grandma would be coming to our house…a total rarity but she was always great to have around. It didn’t seem weird to me then, but as soon as I got into the house…the landline began to ring. I remember seeing my mom talk to the person on the phone and their conversation seemed nice considering she was smiling. She eventually stopped talking but didn’t hang up…she called me over, saying a friend’s parent was on the phone and his son wanted to wish me a happy birthday. I remember feeling very excited…but this feeling started to disintegrate as the man wished me a happy birthday…I recognized his voice but couldn’t quite place it.   
  
Things started to feel really wrong though as I noticed that he never handed the phone over to his ‘son’. He just kept talking to me…about how his son wanted me to come over and play, and he was trying to convince me with a promise of toys, puppies, and candy. That’s when it clicked for me…because that’s what Amy said Dr. Bonbon had at his house the first time she mentioned him. I remember it felt like the whole world just crushed my shoulders at that moment. I think it was also the look on my face, that look of a six-year-old realizing that something was very and deeply wrong, that convinced my mother that ‘Dr. Bonbon’ wasn’t so imaginary. I remember she took the phone from my hands and started talking then yelling at the person on the phone before hanging up.  
  
It wasn’t long before calls like this would start happening every single time I got back home from school. As soon as I opened the door, the house would be bombarded by that annoying ringing…and the first few times I actually did answer. Only to be met with “Emma, why don’t you wanna play with me?” then a slew of what I can only call an attempt at a Mickey Mouse giggle. These phone incidents only occurred more frequently as the days went on…until it wasn’t uncommon for the phone to be ringing non-stop…I don’t mean figuratively. Every number change, every new phone, every attempt at contacting the police…none of it stopped whoever this man was from calling our phone over and over and over. It wasn’t uncommon to fall asleep to the sound of the downstairs phone blaring throughout the house…or to fall asleep to our parents talking with the police as the phone blared over their conversations.  
  
I remember in early December; my dad had gotten rid of every phone in the house. I couldn’t explain it, but I felt the need to apologize to him. If I hadn’t let Amy walk home alone that day…none of this would’ve been happening. But even after we threw our phones out…that didn’t stop him from calling. Neighbors would come to our door at random intervals to inform my parents of a strange man calling for them. Even our school wasn’t safe…me and Amy have both been pulled out of class because our ‘father’ was calling for us…and we would answer the phone only to be greeted with “Why don’t you wanna play with me?”  
  
I still have some stories about these seven years to tell…I’m visiting my mom and Amy this weekend and I hate to bring these traumas back up…but I intend to ask them about this time of our life for more accurate details to relay. Hope to update you all soon.
