I was craving that rush. That gut-punch kick of ecstasy that hits you when things suddenly go your way.

*Good news! That scout dug your show!*  
*Good news! They’re gonna play it on the radio!*  
*Good news! You’ve sold out a whole stadium!*

Well into my mid-20s, I believed that burst of joy was something you had to chase, a carrot that propelled you through life, always just out of reach. Once I hung around enough pricey green rooms though, I realized that happy kick can be found in powdered form.

Like shooting off fireworks from the pit of your stomach. A brilliant explosion in the sternum. Teeth gritting, muscle twitching, howl-in-joy happiness. Straight from a mysterious little man who was a stranger not twenty minutes prior.

*Good news! You’re high!*

When my agent sent me out here, she said it was to get me away from the press. The internet was filled with cellphone vids of my final glorious night. People had all sorts of questions. Answering them would just get me into deeper shit. Last thing I needed was more condemnations. Disappearing off the face of the earth would let people move on to the next star who made a ruckus somewhere public.

My agent said I was going to the *Detox Zone* to keep a low profile. Nothing to do with the drugs. Not a day into my stay, my gut let me know she wasn’t being honest with me.

Hunkering down in an unknown rehab facility in middle-of-nowhere Central Asia would keep me out of the newsfeeds. That was true. What didn’t occur to me on the flight, however, was that you can’t find baggies in the middle of the steppe.

I’ve never considered myself an addict. I’ve grown up with them. I’ve been in relationships with them. Hell, I’ve done a lot of drugs with them. I’ve always considered myself far too composed and in control to be a junkie. Two days into my stay, I realized the only thing keeping me from being called an addict was the question of supply and time management.

I was craving that rush. That rush of raw animalistic victory over the humdrum chemical realities of the brain. Pacing back and forth, digging fingers into palms, shadowboxing with the intensity of a life-or-death battle — I was jonesing bad.

The *Detox Zone* had saunas and meditation rooms and massage parlors and sensory deprivation tanks — but all of those were downers. Those things were meant to calm me. I didn’t need calming. I needed fuel. I needed a rush. I needed something to plug that gaping hole at the core of my being.

 

It’s with that gulping emptiness in my abdomen that I enter the lobby on the third day. I stalk the lobby back and forth, trying to do mental gymnastics about the length of my stay. No matter how hard I try to miscount, my math always checks out. Two months. No ties to the outside world.

Once my reality becomes unavoidable, I let out a long-labored sigh. The receptionist watches me but he says nothing. When our eyes meet, he gives me a friendly service industry smile. *We don’t judge at the Detox Zone*, his eyes read. The receptionist remains professional but I’ve worked enough service jobs in my younger years to know he’ll be bitching about me to his friends off the clock.

I slow down. I take a deep breath. I busy myself with the landscape pictures on the wall.

‘Is this a real place?’ I finally ask, pointing to the biggest frame on the wall. The stone on the picture is dark and ruffled and ancient. With my eyes strained with sleeplessness I can’t tell if I’m looking at a blown-up photograph or an artist’s rendition.

‘This? Yes, sir. This is real place.’ His eyes greet me as if I’d just manifested into the lobby instead of stomping around in it for twenty minutes. ‘It is real place. We call it… in translation it would be *Valley of Powerful Crab*.’

His manicured hand spreads out towards the glass walls of the lobby. Out beyond the flat grassy steppe, there’s the suggestion of mountains on the horizon. ‘Very beautiful place,’ the receptionist says. ‘Very calming.’

‘What’s that, ten K away?’

‘Yes sir, about ten kilometers. Two hours away.’

My feet are restless. Never been much of a hiker — but my feet are restless.

‘Might go check it out,’ I say.

The receptionist’s face shifts. A glint of discomfort flashes across his eyes.

‘Sir, you must not,’ the man says, his voice dropping by a couple of decibels. ‘Journey to *Valley of Powerful Crab*, is the bad idea.’

‘Why not?’

His brow furrows. He thinks, hard, while trying to keep up a rehab lobby smile.

‘It is far,’ he finally says.

‘You said ten K,’ I remind him.

‘Yes, but ten kilometers through foreigner in steppe. It is different. Sometimes foreigner go missing.’ He glances out of the window and then lowers his eyes. ‘Sun sharp in steppe. Dangerous. You should stay in facility. We have good massage. Free for you.’

I look out of the window at the overcast morning. The mountains aren’t particularly close, but the sun seems to be no trifle.

‘I think I can manage,’ I say, as I walk over to the exit. ‘Thank you for the advice!’

‘No!’ the receptionist yells, his voice bouncing around the empty lobby. His polite smile drains when he hears the echo. ‘Sir, going to valley is the bad idea,’ he says, his voice lowering to a whisper. ‘I will do explaining but… I cannot explaining here.’

He watches me. Prodding me for trustworthiness. Then he looks around the lobby, assuring himself that there are no other customers. He grabs a piece of paper from behind the counter and carefully writes down a message.

*Back in 10 minute*

He walks out the front door of the lobby and I follow him. As we walk through the grounds of the *Detox Zone,* the receptionist doesn’t say a word. I don’t ask any questions. I’m just happy to be in motion.

We walk past the gates and out of the facility grounds. Near a cottage that seems significantly less modern than the sleek new-age design of the *Detox Zone*, the receptionist lights up a cigarette. He offers me one.

I’ve never smoked a cigarette sober, but beggars can’t be choosers. The nicotine is like bread-crumbs to a starving man — the longing at the pit of my stomach isn’t satiated, but there’s the merest of suggestions that I’m moving in the right direction.

‘You cannot go to *Valley of Powerful Crab*. It is beautiful place, but it is place of the danger.’

‘What’s so dangerous about it?’ I ask, tasting the notes of cheap tobacco on the back of my tongue. ‘Path to it seems empty enough.’

He looks off to the steppe and the mountains beyond. He nods. ‘Path is not dangerous,’ he finally says. ‘*Valley of Powerful Crab* is not dangerous too. It is not valley that is the danger. It is what is near valley that is big problem.’

‘And dare I ask what’s near the valley?’

He takes another puff, formulating his words. Whatever English vocabulary the man picked up is lacking for what he’s trying to express. The smoke comes out through clenched teeth, as if he were trying to spook out something deep within his lungs.

‘Near the valley is the bad place,’ he finally says. ‘Place of big problem. Of dark science. Of Evil magic. It is place we call the Ғылыми қондырғы.’

Every syllable of the name crashes through my eardrum like discomforting artillery. The smoke around us grows still, as if the universe itself was trying to cover up our mouths.

‘The *what*?’ I ask, once a gust of wind parts the smell of burnt tobacco and returns a hint of normalcy to the conversation.

The receptionist doesn’t repeat the words. He, instead, starts recommending the various other activities the *Detox Zone* offers. There’s a yoga class happening every three hours, state of the art gym, a pool and a thousand other things I could do instead. I smile and nod and smoke and tell him I appreciate the suggestions.

But I know exactly where I’m going.

Perhaps, there have been too many people in my early life who have told me I couldn’t do something. Perhaps, it is simply the nature of stardom. Perhaps, I have just been raised wrong — but I don’t like being told *no*.

I bum two more cigarettes from the receptionist, slip him a tip and then go back to my room. The complimentary water thermos and chocolate raided from the minifridge serve as my supplies for the expedition. I chow down on one of the Mars bars before I even leave *Detox Zone* property.

As I walk towards the gate, I feel the gentlest bit of excitement washes through my lungs. The tide grows and grows until I reach the edge of the gravel pathway leading out. When I cross the threshold over onto untouched land, things, for a moment, start to feel familiar. I embrace for my neurochemistry to give me a hit.

But it doesn’t.

As I walk across the steppe towards the forbidden valley, my internal life simmers back down towards craving.

So, I run. I figure I won’t feel sluggish if my heart rate picks up, so I run.

I’ve treated my body like a Christmas chemistry set. Didn’t expect to get too far. As I pick up the pace, however, I surprise myself. I realize I’m not *that* out of shape! For the first couple minutes of my jog, I feel *good*. That tenseness in my abdomen gets stretched out. My thoughts turn sharper and less sluggish and I’m way too focused on my feet to think about the dread.

But then, I get a shooting pain in my side. And then my lungs start to ache. And then I stop. And, eventually, as the misery sets back in, I light up one of the cigarettes I bummed from the receptionist.

I’m too proud to turn back, and as I walk, that pride gnaws at me. The *Detox Zone* shrinks off on the horizon and storm clouds grow to the West of the mountains, but I keep going. When my internal monologue starts to question what I am trying to achieve, I make more attempts at jogging towards the valley.

Pushing myself to run takes some of the wind out of my racing thoughts, but whenever I inevitably slow down my neuroses come back to bite me twofold. I drink water to make up for the sweat. When I eat another bar of chocolate to replenish my energy, the sting in my side turns into a stab.

A sluggish thunderstrike rumbles across the steppe. There’s lightning on the horizon. By the time it starts to drizzle, I can’t see the *Detox Zone* anymore. By the time it starts pouring, the stiches in my abdomen become a suitable alternative to not getting drenched.

There’s a couple of trees in front of the structures of stone, but I do my best to avoid their shelter. Only a moron would stand under a tree during a thunderstorm. I congratulate myself for finding an outcropping of rock to hide under. My self-esteem takes a dive when I remember where I am.

My career is publicly imploding and I’m stuck on the other side of the globe hiding under a rock. Why? Because I want to prove something to myself. What was it that I was trying to improve to myself? That, I can’t quite verbalize.

The lower I feel, the more my nose twitches, the more I realize how ragged I’ve worn my dopamine receptors. Failure scratches through my veins and stretches the crater at the center of my soul. So many people warned me. My family, my friends, the few women that I let see past my built-up walls — they all warned me.

They warned me and I didn’t listen.

I bury my head in my palms and I weep. I weep for my career and my decisions and my past and my future. Above me, the storm rages. Past my sobs thunder crashes across an unknown land and torrents of water slip down untouched stone.

My mind and soul are a deluge of babbling chaos, yet beyond my wails and the storm, I hear something else. Behind me, pebbles shift. I do not rush to turn around; I feel far too sluggish. The idea of not being alone in my hiding spot doesn’t occur to me at all.

What I witness, however, drains at the little sanity I have left.

Crabs. Massive crabs with thick shells and terrible pincers and bulbous eyeballs growing from their body. There are three of them, but with the sheer number of eyes on display I feel like I am being stared down by an audience.

When I see them, I shriek in terror. This sends them scattering toward me. They pinch their claws and their many eyes stare and I cannot comprehend what I am witnessing. Unsure of whether I have simply gone mad from withdrawal or whether I have stumbled upon something which defies known biology, I run out into the rain.

I pay no mind to the storm or where I’m going. The only bright burning goal in my skull is to get away from the incomprehensible crabs. Quickly, I lose them in the curtain of rain, yet no matter how many corners I turn through the maze of stone, I still feel like I am being watched.

I duck through caves and struggle through uneven ground, desperately trying to escape that which I cannot comprehend. When my body finally gives up on me and my legs go limp — I end up in a familiar place.

Ruffled dark stone stretches out around me into a grassy clearing shielded by outcroppings of rock. Water slides down from the ancient nature and falls to the earth like a domed waterfall. Even past the curtain of rain, I can recognize the picture from the lobby.

I sprawl out against one of the rock walls and make sure I am alone. The crashing of the water from above is loud enough to make me doubt my hearing, but after a couple minutes my heart calms. Past my labored breath and the storm, I hear no crabs. After a couple of more minutes, even my lungs soothe into controlled breaths.

The storm above me dies down. The waterfalls which obscure my view of the clearing trickles down into a symphony of dripping rain. After a while longer, even the remnants of the storm disappear. A warm afternoon sun peeks in through the clouds and a slight hint of a rainbow spreads out beyond.

I find myself tranquil. I do not know if it is because I escaped the crabs, or whether it is the passing storm or whether it is the sense of achievement from reaching my vague goal — but I find myself calming.

I sit on the stones and watch the beautiful nature beyond. There is no rush in my chest, I do not feel the ecstasy that I have been so desperately craving since that horrible night back home, yet even though I’m not shaking with joy I do find myself free of want.

That hole at the center of my being is still there, but it no longer hungers. Sitting on the rocks, I find myself content. I find myself happy in the stillness.

I sit and I think and I embrace the peace. Time becomes immaterial. My worries still float around the back of my head, but they’re weightless. I know that as long as I stay in my little tranquil corner of the globe, my problems will keep their distance.

I sit and I breathe and I enjoy the silence, yet when I see the sun dip out of sight, I concede that I can’t spent the night in the mountains. Before I get up and return to the dredges of my real life, I stretch. I stretch and it feels good and I feel like my journey had the slightest shred of purpose, yet, as I lower my arms, I hear something shift behind me.

When I turn, I find a hundred eyes staring at me from the depths of the cavern. The crabs. The same ones with those shell-grown eyeballs I thought I’d hallucinated. They’re back. They’re glassy stares are laser focused on me. With every twitch of my body, the horrible creatures advance towards me, snapping their massive pincers with discomforting volume.

My moment of tranquility has sobered me. When I realize that the crabs solely respond to my movement, I calm my breath and steady my hands. With my bones ready to jump out of my skin, I slowly reach into my jacket pocket and take out my last piece of provisions. With as little motion as I can, I throw the Mars bar to the other side of the clearing.

Most of the crab creatures scatter towards the chocolate. When the fastest moving of the consortium starts to snip at the Mars bar with its claws, all but one of the crabs join in. As the majority of the hellish creature pass me, I hold my breath and grit my teeth.

There is but one left. Its shell is flaky with age and the eyeballs that adorn it are bloodshot. The creature is the slowest of the bunch, yet its attention is singular. Slowly, ever so slowly, it approaches me. Its pincers click with deadly tempo.

I reserve hope that maybe the crab creature is simply old and slow to join with the rest of the group, but that hope quickly faulters. With every spidery step the beast takes towards me, with every second of unbroken sickly eye contact — I am certain the crab is heading towards me.

It’s not until the old crustacean is within kicking distance that I act. With one swift movement, I hope to propel the creature towards its brethren — yet even with its sluggish pincers the beast manages to grab ahold of my ankle. Blood quickly springs through my jeans and the rest of the crabs skitter in the direction of motion. I do not waste any time. With pain surging up my leg and terror beating in my heart, I run.

I do not know where or how I shake the beast attached to my limb, but I do. I rush out of the cave system and out into the flat steppe. As I run past the trees the stiches in my sides spring up again with renewed strength, but I pay them no attention. My mind is clear of all pain or concern.

I have one goal, and that is to get away alive.

I run and my chest heaves and I feel the need to lie down and vomit — yet I do not. I keep running. Even as my shoe fills with blood and lungs burn with exhaustion and spittle drips from my mouth like the jowls of a rabid horse, I keep running.

I keep running and I don’t stop running until the dot on the horizon starts to take shape into a familiar rehab clinic. It is only once the valley behind me is mere suggestion and the visions of the crabs descend back into the territory of potential hallucination that I slow down.

I slow down, walking the rest of the way back to the Detox Zone. As I do, a familiar feeling starts to bubble in my abdomen. At first, it simmers, like slowly boiling water, yet the closer I get, the more the waves strengthen.

A rush. From the bottom of my stomach to the top of my sternum. Floating bubbles of jubilant ecstasy. A biological victory propelled through neurochemistry. My fists tighten and my lips raise in a vicious smile. My body shoots a message across my mind which dulls every other unpleasant sensation I feel:

 

*Good news! You escaped the killer* [*crabs*](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/comments/q2qjz1/%D2%93%D1%8B%D0%BB%D1%8B%D0%BC%D0%B8_%D2%9B%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B%D1%80%D2%93%D1%8B/)*!*
