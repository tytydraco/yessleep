Part 1

I peeked through the small slits of fabric that concealed my face. I had some kind of sack over my head. It had a stench, unlike regular fiber. It smelled like the rotting guts of a dead animal, as if it had been used to store small game after a hunt. My face was muddled in a substance that felt like tar, invading every pore. My wrists were bound together as my arms hung from an unknown point. I felt the cool winter breeze brushing against my bare chest. Whatever brought me here removed my vest, my blouse, and my shirt, but left my trousers. My arms felt like what I could only describe as an intense static as my heart worked overtime to pump blood into them. I gasped after i awoke and jerked my head every which way, trying to make sense of my surroundings from the small splits in the fabric of my veil. I needed a way out.

I could still feel my limbs, so I knew I hadn't hung there long enough to lose all sensation in my arms. My hands were crossed together as I hung, grasping at the rope at awkward angles. I grasped the rope and muscled my way up towards whatever branch I was hanging from. That's when the line snapped. I had nothing to grab onto and fumbled to the ground, not expecting the sudden release from my binds. I lie there for what feels like an eternity, blood rushing back into my limbs hastily as I struggle to gather myself to my feet. My my wrists were still bound together in front of me, but I was now free to pull the hood off from my head. As my vision came back into focus, I stood before the ogre. Two pale, massive stumps of legs with old, worn boots covered in every type of grime imaginable. It stood shirtless, wrapped in an accordian of razor wire, looming above me as I met its gaze. The spool of razor wire wrapped around its menacing hood as it looked down upon me as a rodent compared to its massive figure. The ogre had cut me loose from the rope with an old, rusted machete. I took 2 cautious steps backwards before turning to make a break for it. The thing planted its massive size 30 boot into my back and shoved me. I flew forwards, crumbling to the dirt. My face planted into the ground and slid against the dirt several feet. I laid there, helpless.

The thing knelt next to me and grabs a handful of my hair, pulling my head up to see what was presented before me. Private Shaw and Sergeant Thompson hung by their wrists upon 2 sturdy tree branches. Both their mouths were taped shut as their eyes beamed at me with a gaze of pure terror. Their chests had shallow carvings that left trails of dried blood down their torsos. Upon Shaw's chest was carved the number "1". Sergeant Thompson's chest read "2" in a zig-zag style font. I winced in horror as I pieced together what was happening.

"No...", I muttered. "No, no, no! Please-" It dragged me forward by my hair and trudged forward towards my comrades. It threw me forward, sliding me against the grass towards the 2 sinister trees. I gathered myself to my knees and turned to grovel before the hulking, unfeeling beast, using my own life as a bargaining chip to release my friends. I made an oath to Shaw- to all my comrades- that we would one day return home together and get drunk by the fire, recalling tales of the war, retiring with our wives and kids as we look back fondly upon our time together. I would sooner face the horrors of war than face this creature a moment longer. The solemn promise to my comrades was being taken by this cold, emotionless thing. It wanted me to choose between them

"Take me!", I screamed at the top of my lungs. I swung my arms open and looked up at the beast, my eyes wide and full of unbridled, hopeless rage. "Kill me motherfucker! Kill me! You scared? Huh?!" I grinned mockingly towards the beast. "Do it you fucking pussy!" I screamed until my throat burned. I spat at the ogre's feet, creating yet another meaningless stain on its tattered leather boots. It stared back at me, frozen, unmoving. Shaw and Thompson both let out muffled cries to get my attention. In the back of my mind, I knew they were both brave enough to accept their fates, but I was not brave enough to watch them die a horrible death in these woods. The ogre reached its hand out and offered me the rusty blade. I stared at it for several seconds, considering what little options I had. I hesitated as I reached towards the blade, pausing for a moment before snatching it out of the ogre's hand. I rushed forwards, shoving the dull blade straight into the calf of the beast's leg. It was pure muscle and only left a shallow gash, a few inches deep. If anyone were dying today, it would be me.

Before skipping a beat, it grabbed me by the nape of my neck and slowly lifted me up off the ground like a disobediant cat. It guided me up towards its face, mere inches from mine. It stared into my soul through the cracks in the wire spooled around its head. I felt its harsh judgement. Its disapproval of my choice. I felt the same miserable guilt that I felt getting caught sneaking out of the house when I was a teenager. I embraced what was to come next, ever looking forward, unafraid into the eyes of satan himself. It tossed me aside with tremendous power, sending me flying into the brush. I crumpled to the ground and rolled around like a limp ragdoll. My back spun and smacked against a tree. I winced painfully and looked up to face the ogre. The creature, kneeling over, yanked the blade out from its leg. Not a drop of blood spilled from its wounded extremity, as if its muscles were made entirely of dead leather and no blood vessels. It walked forward, towards sergeant Thompson, not even limping from its injury. It grabbed his rope and cut Thompson loose as he fell to his hands and knees. Thompson slowly raised his head, eyes filled with panic. It reached down and grabbed Thompson by the throat, raising him about a dozen feet off the ground. It stared into his eyes as Thompson writhed and thrashed, punching at the massive hand that gripped his windpipe. I ran forward towards the monster and lunged towards the blade in its hand. It threw its arm back and sent me hurdling, once again.

At this point, I was broken. I had several cracked ribs and a sharp pain in my back that would not subside. I laid there, sprawled out in the shrubs and saw Thompson. His eyes were bulging out of their sockets as he scratched at the ogre's hand helplessly. The ogre leaned forward, staring into the eyes of Thompson, centimeters from his face as it tightened its grip with a sickening, hollow crunch. Thompson went limp. I wailed in agony, paralyzed from the pain that writhed in my body. The only thing I could do is cry for someone, anyone to hear my sobs. Thompson's lifeless body crumpled to the ground. The ogre then affixed its gaze towards Shaw. It lumbered forward and grabbed the rope that Shaw was hanging from. It lifted Shaw, meeting its gaze with his. Shaw gave a cold, blank stare towards the beast. Shaw wasn't afraid. The ogre took one last moment, gazing into the eyes of Shaw before plunging the blade deep into his stomach. Shaw let out a muffled scream of pure agony, breathing heavy as he stared back into the eyes of death. Shaw gave a flare of pure rage and agony as the monster twisted the blade into his stomach. I averted my eyes.

After a few moments, I heard the blade unsheathe, along with the indistinct spattering of blood and guts against the leaves. Shaw hung limp from his rope and looked downwards, that same expression of hatred and agony wrinkled across his face. He died a warrior, unafraid, as he was in life. The ogre bent over and picked up a single large sack from underneath Shaw's tree. He slowly turned his head towards me as I hung my head in contempt for the loss of my brethren. It stood before me as I stared down into the mud. It grabbed me by the back of my head, and plunged my face into the dirt. Darkness filled my vision.
