 There comes a certain sense of contentment when you’re about to die. 

It’s insidious in nature, one that slowly builds in the weeks that lead up to it and climaxes in the moment. A sort of contentment that would be impossible to possess in the life you lead and one that you will only experience at the brink of its ending. Then that’s it. Gone. *Kaput.* 

Or at least, that’s what I’ve been told.

Once we turn twelve here a date appears on our forearms. It’s in black ink, written in the penmanship you would expect from a doting grandparent on a birthday card, all smooth strokes and a curved flourish on the strokes that separated the numbers. Mine appeared instantaneously, immediately after the hands reached midnight – which was surprising. Emma’s had come 3 hours into her twelfth year and Tom’s ten hours later. My friends had to endure hours of anticipation just to mark a date on the calendar, in the end. Instead, I received instant gratification. 

The feeling of the numbers on my arm was distinct – almost as if whatever higher power that deemed when our lives ended was writing on it themselves. I could almost feel their breath on the back of my neck as it happened, a somewhat ticklish sensation occurring as the numbers appeared. My mother was overjoyed when she came into my room; she saw the punctual arrival as auspicious and promised to buy me another cake after my first. I almost laughed at the expression on her face when I finally showed her the date. 

**22/3/2025**

There, branded into my skin in unforgettable, thick black lettering, was a date that had already happened. A date from last year. 

The plate in her hands fell to the floor, shattering into pieces. And – I’ll never forget this – she looked at me like she was seeing me for the first time. Like I was an unwelcome visitor in her house, a nuisance that needed removing. 

Like I was a ghost. 

The breath caught in her throat, and she spluttered, failing to vocalise what we were both thinking. I beat her to it. 

‘Why am I still here?’ I croaked, feeling an unmistakable dread build in my gut. There was no way it was a mistake. What was written on your arm was subsequently written in the stars. There was no conceivable way, not in any universe, that this could have been incorrect. 

I saw her own prediction slip out of the sleeve of her top. Two years or so from now. She had already begun to settle her debts and looking for clients to purchase our small flat once she had gone. It was an accepted fact, no time to be sad or contemplate that I only had around two birthdays with her after this one. 

Well, of course, before what just transpired. 

She cleared her throat, sweat beading in her hairline. ‘I need to tell you something.’ She wasn’t making eye contact. It was as if I was already transparent. ‘I’m really sorry sweetheart.’ 

I knew what she meant, knew what was coming. I think a sick part of me resulted in what I said next. ‘What is it? Please tell me, you’re scaring me.’ 

For the first time in the last five minutes, she made eye contact, exhaling in preparation. Grey met blue. ‘I can’t keep you here like this anymore.’ Her bottom lip quivered, and she cowered away from me like I was a dangerous person, like I was something that would overpower her and steal her life too early. 

‘I need to let you go. I should have never let this go on for so long.’ 

I was flesh and blood, a beating heart. I was her daughter in front of her, looking up at what created me. 

‘I did this to you. I’m so sorry.’ Sobs were coming from her mouth in quick succession, and when I tried to reach out for her arm she yelped in panic, swatting my attempt away. Her breaths came in short blasts as she gazed at me for what seemed like the last time and the realisation of what she had done overwhelmed my body.

My mother watched the exhumed corpse shake with a mixture of tears and laughter, its mangled and rotted body shaking with the weight of its mother’s wrongdoing. You see, my death prediction was right, after all. 

It had already passed. But she couldn’t bear to see me go. Couldn’t bear to leave me alone, if only for a moment. If only for eternity. This was why I was slumped in the corner of this damned room, the organs failed and skin withering away. She dug me out of that grave herself even after she put me in there, the slicing of the plate on my head being the death blow. Guilt does amazing things to person. 

What remains is the fact that she stole that contentment away from me. Death is a slow and content process here. Once it happens it’s almost as falling asleep. 

But I didn’t get that feeling. I died at the age of eleven by my mother’s hand, the same one that took that tranquility away from me. 

And was left in this makeshift state, a statis of eternal dread.
