  
I saw the journal in an unclaimed evidence box that had collected about an inch of dust on top. It was a slower night at the precinct, and the chief never said no to looking in the storage to keep us busy. I opted to help out some of the fellow detectives by digging through some archives. Couple of them wanted to reopen the case and that's where I spotted it.  

This case had opened in May of 2011, when a now-retired ranger had found the journal in the Mojave next to a collapsed tent strangely discarded bedding. No footprints around it, no trace of the hiker nor a vehicle. The sun had bleached the journal's fabric but no ink faded. Strangely enough it was filed as *solved.*

I blew the dust off of the journal itself. 

***Property of Anna Morrison*** was the first page greeted me. 

I quickly scanned through the first few pages. This lady had this journal for years. I realized there were some highlighted tabs sticking out of the top. That must've been for the case. 

I did a quick turn of my surrounds before delving in. It was a slow night after all, I had to indulge my curiosity.

I now wish that I didn't. Some things are not worth the curiosity, and now I'm left with more questions than answers. 



***May 1st:***

*It really was nice to get away from it all. I can't remember the last time I had the chance to step away from work and really “get out there” you know? I suppose that was my own doing, I know Vinny would've wanted me to take time for myself instead of buying my head in my soul-sucking pharmacy job. Love makes you do stupid things, and loss does as well.*

*To celebrate my 50th hiking trail, I'm going East to get deeper into the Mojave to complete the trail known as The Ceramic Path. Sounds pretty doesn't it?*

*The Ceramic Path is apparently so isolated and untouched that the trail isn’t registered online. It IS real though, my good friend and mentor Oscar said once he completed it he had a transformation of the soul, which I was in dire need of.* 

*The locals outside the Mojave area looked at me like I had two heads while Oscar and I picked up supplies for my journey. Some were nice about it, others were quick to call me “one of them crazy star peoples” and that I was too much of a hippie to be looking for something that didn't exist. But I was more than determined.* 



***May 3rd:*** 

*Oscar ventured with me until we reached the trailhead. It was three perfectly smooth and round slabs of stone standing upright in a perfect row. It looked manmade, so I was confused as to why there were rumors this path was untouched for so long. Oscar left, as this wasn’t his path to walk but my own. Thankfully it was a much cooler day to start things off. I almost felt the breeze grip my hand and guide it forward. It felt like Vinny’s but I knew that wasn’t right.*

*Fortunately for me, Oscar left me a paper map with the Ceramic Path perfectly marked for me. It would be a four day hike each way. At the furthest point in the hike I was told by Oscar that “the stars will change, and you will come out stronger and higher than before. Then you walk back with your soul anew” Shamans have a funny way of talking, but Oscar was a big help when Vinny passed. I wish I could see him again, it’s been six months, but still the police coming to my door to tell me my fiance died on that sinking ship feels like it happened this morning.* 

*There was no animal or other hiker in sight today. Strange, I didn’t even hear an insect chitter. Even by the fire right now, the flickering embers almost sound muffled. It’s like my ears are constantly about to “pop” like they’re plugged. Hopefully I will adjust to the climate.* 



***May 4th (morning)***

*Rough sleep, I had my first nightmare in a while. Vinny and I are having a picnic at our favorite park when suddenly the sun begins to tear apart, and my world goes up in flames. Still, I managed to make some good food this morning which took my mind off of that dreaded experience. Only a few days left before my “metamorphosis” whatever that means.* 

*I noticed some strange carvings in the rocks. They resemble the ones I saw at the beginning of the trail, but the center one is cracked open and looks like it's leaking something. Looking at the map I’m definitely going the right way, but I am really starting to feel very alone. It looks like there’s elevation coming later this day. Hopefully there’s cell service! Maybe I’ll be able to call Oscar, or mom or dad or anyone really. I haven’t seen anyone. No footprints, just these strange rocks.*



***May 4th (evening)***

*I managed to pitch my tent nestled in between a few shrubs. I haven’t left the tent, and I don’t have any real desire to. Still have no cell service even atop this hill. I see one of those rock carvings probably every hundred meters. It looks like it’s lining up with the map so far.* 

*Something strange I noticed, you ever get that feeling when you know you’re being watched, but you can’t tell who’s looking at you? I’ve been getting that every time I linger around one of those rocks.* 



***May 5th (morning)***

*The shrubs that I pitched my tent near had vanished, instead piles of carved rocks took their places. The rocks, they’re humming now! At least for now they’ll serve as a trail marker. I really want to turn back, but I’m expecting to get to the end point by tonight.* 

*More of those rocks guided my path. Out of curiosity, I tried snapping a photo of one but my camera app kept crashing every time.* 

*The sun’s brighter than normal. Not a cloud in the sky. It fries my peripheries but I need to keep forward. I crossed through a ravine, only to encounter another one. I double checked the map. I was probably getting turned around because of how bright it was. Probably stumbled off the path somewhere. I could still see the final stretch on the horizon. Something was off, though.*

*The minute I climbed out of the second ravine, the final stretch had grown. The hill leading up to the Ceramic Path’s end looked as if it would take another few days to get to. But that made no sense, was it just the heat getting to me? I persevered for as long as I could before settling into my tent.*



***May 5th: (evening)***

*I swear the stars are moving. My phone is dead, I can’t record anything. The stars look close to me, too. Like I could grab them if I jumped. I attempted, and they shifted away from my hand. It’s like they were alive. My mind is telling me to turn around, but I feel a tense urge in my body to persist. I feel my legs carry themselves to the end of the path it seems like.* 

*I think I’m losing it. I saw Vinny- well not quite. It looked like him after he drowned. His clothes were soaked, but his eyes were bright, bright like the stars. He begged me to keep going, that “I’m past the point of no return and that I'm almost home” all while pointing at the path’s end. Through my tears, I saw that the end point was now practically moving towards me. It was slow, very slow, like watching the clouds shift on a day with a gentle breeze. I scrambled back into the tent, zipping it shut and curled into a ball. I want this nightmare to be done with.* 

*My ears are ringing, there’s something glowing outside my tent. I don’t dare to look till morning.*



***May 6th: (morning)***

*It’s brighter than it should be outside. Everything looks like it’s been bleached white, even for a hot desert. It doesn’t hurt my eyes anymore. My body and mind both need to reach the end of the path. I saw the marker rocks ahead and made my journey. There’s a rumbling in my body, like tinnitus but deeper, beneath my ears and closer to my neck.* 

*The stars haven’t left, either. They’re floating above and beside me, guiding me upwards. I feel lighter as I reach the top. I almost felt my feet hover above the slope a few times.* 



***May 6th (evening)***

*When I reached the top, I suddenly stepped foot on perfectly flat land. Ahead of me was not a carved rock, but a shape nonetheless. I saw the three circles from the carvings. Three, beautiful stars. Humming in the sky that looked unfamiliar to me. The night shifted constantly at impossible speeds but not once did the sun come up. The three stars radiated an energy that dropped me to my knees. A crack formed in the center one, and something leaked, splattering the ground in front of me. The spill took shape.*

*Then I saw him again: Vinny.* 

*Well it’s still not quite Vinny, it’s not the Vinny from the moment we met, or the funeral. He emerged from the shape, arm outstretching, too many fingers.* 

*“You made it, like always” I heard his voice inside my body, my bones, my head. I was too tired, too warm. I stretched out my hand and we touched. I felt the stars enter my body, I think I remember being part of something bigger, before this life. Before the grief. Before the name I wrote in this journal.* 

*I understand why I’m here, now. The hardships, the pain, losing what I thought was him only for it to be so much more. No, for us to be so much more.*

*I’m going with him.* 



There is no entry date for the last part, but based on how scratchy and smudgy the writing is I can assume a good amount of time has passed. 



***Now,***

*Vinny and I are watching the stars go down. It looks a lot different from above. I sometimes miss when my feet touch the ground. Words seem meaningless, it’s beginning to get difficult to hold a pen. Yet, I’ve never felt less pain in my life, and I’ve never felt so much love. I don’t believe we’ll ever find loss in our lives again. We’re together, although I’m not just me anymore.*

*If you read this, come find me, walk my path for I cannot any longer. You’ll have your answer.*
