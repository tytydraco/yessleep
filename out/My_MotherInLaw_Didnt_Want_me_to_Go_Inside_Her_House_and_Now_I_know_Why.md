“Nervous about seeing her?” Arnold asked.

“Your mother?”

“Yeah…”

“You know, it’s just the whole…going over uninvited thing….She’s a real creature of habit.”

“You know my opinion," Arnold said.

"Yes," I said, "you're never exactly shy with your opinions."

"Mother has been very evasive lately," Arnold said. "I think we need to do a wellness check."

"Well, I’m glad my parents live in San Diego. Out of sight, out of mind.” I replied. He stared out the passenger side window and whistled a tune I didn’t recognize.

Meanwhile, I stared ahead, taking in the long stretches of empty sidewalk. It suddenly felt difficult to swallow my own saliva. *Almost there,* I thought, as we hooked a right onto Allen Street. A few people were outside mowing their lawns, but the sidewalks were empty.

We reached the end of the block and there it was: Arnold's childhood home. Somehow dusty looking, even on the outside. Paint was peeling from its sides like a flag at half-staff. *Holy shit*, I thought, *Arnold's mom's really let the place go since his dad died*.

Arnold's mother greeted us at the front door with the same aloof expression she had worn like a mask since the first time I'd met her.

“Hello, Marie,” I said, giving her a lifeless kiss on the cheek. “We’re sorry to do a drive-by without calling ahead, but as you suburban types say, ‘we just happened to be in the neighborhood.’

"Here…” Arnold said, quickly, handing his mother some roses he had picked up for the occasion. “I thought you might like these. I know you love the red ones.” I wondered if Arnold knew my favorite type of roses. It wouldn't much matter, not that he ever bought me any.

“Oh, aren't these lovely," Arnold's mother said in a wispy tone. “Aren't they just…something….” She gripped the flowers in her hands tightly, holding them at a slant. Water started dripping over the stems, and little pink petals fell as she jostled the plastic package around like yesterday’s newspaper. “I’ll go put these in water,” she said. “Just wait here a moment while I go and tidy up. As you know, I wasn't expecting anybody.”

“They’re cut flowers,” Arnold explained. “Water or no, they’re not going to last too long…”

“But they are so lovely, I want to keep them around as long as I can.” The matriarch disappeared behind the screen door, and then she shut the front door as well. 

“Very inviting," I said. "Guess she's not going to invite us in?"

“Give it to me straight," Arnold whined. "Do you think Mother has dementia?”

We waited…and waited….for what was a surprisingly long time. I wondered if maybe the old bird had given us the slip.

“She’s a crafty one, your mother….” I said with an outwardly patient smile.

"Enough," Arnold said. "Just because you're not close to your family doesn't mean I can't be close with mine." Go on…I thought. Go on and lose your temper, already. He looked stuck between gears again.

“I guess we’ll just spend the whole afternoon melting on the front porch...”

“Well, she is eighty,” Arnold said, a bit too defensively. “It just takes her a while to move around, is all.”

“We came to see if she’s all right, and she's apparently well enough. Now let’s leave before one of us suffers a heat stroke.”

Arnold was about to respond when his mother appeared at the door with a tray of lemonade and some of those old-people cookies with the chess symbols on them.

“I thought it was such a lovely day, perhaps we could sit on the back patio.”

“Little hot,” Arnold said.

“We need to toughen this guy up.” She said, smiling at me; the great fake smile of someone trying to hide anger…or a secret. The same expression constantly pasted across Arnold’s face of late.

I knew my mother-in-law had never been one for the great outdoors. She wasn't one to embrace the sun, or bugs, or the other unique pleasures of a New Jersey steamer.

I looked to Arnold, trying to communicate telepathically. *Let's go!* But what can you do? Just shrug your shoulders, take the tray, and made your way around back. So that's what I did.

After we were seated, on a faded concrete patio the color of a sidewalk, I thought Arnold's mother appeared more than a bit …uncomfortable.

“How’s your scrapbooking coming along?” I asked.

“Very well. It sure is something to…reengage with all those old memories.”

“Maybe you can take us inside later, to show us?”

“Why, I’d be more than happy to bring the scrapbook out here…”

“But wouldn’t the sunlight be bad for the photos? You wouldn’t want to bleach them…”

“Oh dear,” she said with a slap to her knee and a too-eager smile. “At my age, you learn to stop sweating the small things."

“Like…sweat,” Arnold joked.

“So does that mean you finally removed the plastic from your couch?” I asked.

“There seems to be a lot of loaded questions for this…impromptu little meeting.” Arnold's Mother looked at us with a grim expression. “Something tells me you two weren’t merely in the neighborhood today.”

“Look, lately we’ve been a bit…concerned about you,” Arnold said, rubbing his hands together as though it were cold outside, rather than ninety-five fucking degrees.

“Concerned?”

“Well of course we are,” Arnold said, now lifting his lemonade from the plastic tray but not drinking from it. “I mean, you’ve been living here alone since Dad passed…and with what happened with Mindy….”

I watched Arnold, and the glass in his hand, and wondered which was sweating more at that moment. Arnold’s a lot of things, I thought, but callow is not usually one of them. I quite enjoyed the glint of fear in his eyes. So this was the one thing Mr. Alpha Male could still respect: Mommy.

“These past few months have been difficult for everybody,” Arnold stammered. He smiled at me for support which was not forthcoming. “And we just wanted to make sure you were—”

“What?” she asked in a vicious tone. “Ready for the 'ol human warehouse?”

“Marie, please,” I said, deciding to come to Arnold’s rescue. “We’re here because we care about you.” I took Arnold’s hand in my own for a moment but he pulled away. “You haven’t invited us over in months, and you used to have us over all the time. Is it something we’ve done?”

At that moment, an odd noise sounded. It seemed to come from inside the house. A muffled sound, like a screen door creaking…or a small dog barking…

Her eyes alighted at that moment with a strange glimmer. Of what? I wondered. Anxiety? Fear? Secrecy? But the old woman quickly recovered and repositioned herself on her spray-painted white, wicker seat. The sound came again, as brief and halting as the wind on that stale afternoon.

“You know,” I said. “For a moment I almost thought I heard Mindy.”

At that, mother’s arm trembled, and a little bit of lemonade spilled onto her hand. She seemed not to notice…

“What’s that supposed to mean?” she said.

She stared for a while, hauntingly at my stomach, perhaps cursing its inability to give her grandchildren. A life purpose for the back nine.  “Can we please speak of something else,” she said. “Anything else.”

Arnold turned the conversation to the news, a topic his mother always enjoyed. The more local, the better. They discussed an accident that morning on Route 73. “Fifteen cars,” she kept repeating. "Two deaths." Later, she talked a bit about her late husband, and about what a tough baby Arnold was to raise.

“I had wanted more than one you know, but I suppose we don’t get to decide everything about our lives.” She shook her head solemnly. “It just wasn’t what God intended. And your father…well he simply wouldn’t stand for adoption. He was so old-fashioned.” When she said that, she sort of glowered at me, and I looked away as though slapped across the face.

“May I use your restroom,” Arnold asked, clearly trying to perform that wellness check.

“Is it an emergency?”

“Well, it was a long ride, ma, and I’m no longer a young man. Apparently my prostate is now roughly the size of a lemon.” He chuckled nervously, trying to hide his anger. But I knew he wouldn’t explode…not with his mom there as a witness. No, he would hold it all in, to share with me on the car ride home.

“The size of a lemon, you don’t say?” mother said with a polite chuckle. “What an indelible image to share while we’re drinking lemonade.”

“Gross, honey,” I added while patting Arnold on the shoulder affectionately. I suppose some small part of me still wanted to save the marriage then. If not, why was I still there?

“Well,” mother said with a cagey expression. “There’s a McDonald’s right across the interstate. I’m sure you could use their restroom.”

“Mom….really? You want me to go to a McDonald's to take a shit?”

"I thought you said you just had to pee?"

"Is there any particular reason why he can't use the bathroom?" I asked.

“It’s just the house isn’t at all fit for company," she replied. "Why, you can’t just sneak up on somebody like this and expect excellent hospitality.”

“He just needs to use the bathroom, Marie, he’s not checking to see if it’s up to code. And he’s your son by the way, not some stranger. He won't care if the house isn't clean.”

“Sometimes you find the biggest strangers of all right there, pluck in the middle of your family. I mean really Jill, to deny Arnold a child simply because of your own physiological issues. It really is the height of selfishness.” She put her hands up as though falsely accused. “Not that it’s any of my business why you won't adopt.”

I looked to Arnold, who was already standing up, biting his lip to the point of bleeding. My first instinct was to have it out with Marie, even if she was old and frail; but there seemed to almost be craft to her comments. Like she was trying to make us go away, rather than allow us in her house. As if on cue, a strange, muffled sound again emanated from inside.

“Let’s just go,” Arnold said. “I can hold it.”

“Honey…”

“I said let’s go!” He was shaking now, ready to lose what little grip he had left. “I’m not going to put up with any more of her passive-aggressive bullshit…I don’t care how old she is….”

“Toodle-oo, Arnold,” his mother said with an aggressive smile. “I guess the next time I see you will be at my funeral. Please make sure to shake out some extra crocodile tears, just like you did at your father's.” She winked at him. “The people are always watching, isn’t that right, our little local politician?”

“I’m going to the car,” Arnold said, his face flush and his jaw clenched.

“I’ll meet you there in a minute,” I said. “But actually, I have to use the bathroom. You didn’t lock the front door…isn’t that right, Marie?”

“Hold on, now,” she said, struggling to stand up. Trying without success to use the sides of the old wicker chair to bring herself vertical. “Just one minute, Missy….”

I started jogging toward the front of the house, through the overgrown grass and weeds and detritus of that place. Past Arnold.

“Come back here,” Marie yelled from behind me. I thought her voice sounded so much older than I remembered. Frail and cracked, like the empty sidewalks of the old neighborhood.

Inside the home of Arnold's childhood. Into the frumpy living room, with its plastic sheets and the smell of last Sunday’s dinner. As though Arnold's mother had cooked a beef stew in a crock pot and just let it sit for time immemorial. I wasn’t sure what to look for, but I had my suspicions…

“Mindy,” I called. “Here…Mindy.” I know that Marie had been told to put the dog down, that it had some sort of new and rare disease, but would that really stop the old woman? I heard a gurgling sound from the basement. Then the sound of movement, as if something was rattling a cage. A metallic-type sound. I made my way down butter-soft stairs, holding onto the old, gray-painted handrail that was moldering at a forty-five degree angle. I heard the front door upstairs quake open, and then the sound of Marie's tiny feet pitter-patter.

“I don’t know what you think you’re doing,” Marie bellowed in that cracked voice. I could tell from the floorboard creaks exactly where she was in the house. Now in the living room, now directly overhead in the kitchen, now at the top of the stairs, huffing and cursing at me, her hateful daughter-in-law.

“Jill, get up here this instant!”

In the back left corner of the basement, fixed between half-opened cans of paint, there was a single dog crate. A rather large one, I thought. Mindy had been just a little Boston terrier. I tiptoed across the basement’s concrete floor, which was warped and moist. The sump pump was sounding even though it hadn’t rained in days. Persistent black mold plastered the white bricks of the basement. *Christ,* I thought, *pretty soon this whole place is going to cave in. Maybe Arnold is right, maybe we do need to put her in assisted living. This place should be condemned.*

There was an old, off-pink blanket wrapping the crate. I seemed to detect movement from inside, but maybe I imagined it. I stepped closer, trying to peer in. The blanket covered all, like a canary’s cage at night.

“Don’t go near that crate, Jill!” Marie shouted from atop the stairs. “I am warning you, Missy….” Then: “Jill! Jill!”

I ignored her, and in one quick move pulled back the blanket. Laying there in the dim fluorescent light of the basement was…Mindy! It had to be her. Mindy was laying on her side, breathing in and out with a slightly labored breath. Her tail was tucked between her legs, and she was making a muffled sound, like dogs sometimes do when they’re dreaming. Her back leg was going, and I assumed she was chasing a squirrel.

I stood in place for a while, wondering how Marie had pulled this off. She had even been contacted by government agencies. They were worried it was some sort of super rabies, or some biological weapon. She had been told that Mindy had to be immediately euthanized, and assured us it had been done. Yet, here was her dog, Mindy, all the same.

The old dog looked almost cute there, wrapped up in a ball with her hind legs going, and her breathing slow and irregular. I didn’t think anything abnormal, aside from the fact that Marie had apparently shirked various health directives.

“Jill! Jill!” Marie continued to shout from atop the stairs. I placed my hand on the crate for a moment to brace myself as I peered in to get a better look. I kneeled on the damp ground, tucking into myself like a forest mushroom.

“Hey, Mindy girl,” I whispered to the dog. Mindy looked like a little pup as she lay there, facing away from me. Her little stomach barely moving. Then, in one thrash, Mindy growled, spun around on me, and bit the fleshy part of my pinky finger that was wrapped around the cage.

“Shit,” I yelped, backing away and seeing fresh blood. I looked down and saw that Mindy’s face was mangled and…almost slick. Translucent. Mindy was foaming and yellow-eyed, sick with some infernal rage. She wants to bite me again, I thought, feeling dizzy. No…to kill me…and perhaps anything else that moves. The dog kept hurling itself into the crate, growling and hissing.

I walked over to the utility sink and washed off the cut. The wound didn’t look too bad once I had run some water over it.

“Jill, please….” Came the voice from the top of the stairwell.

“Coming.”

I placed the sheet back over Mindy…or what used to be Mindy, taking care to keep my distance. Slowly, I made my way to the creaky old basement stairs. The dog kept growling, an endless effigy. 

“Marie….” I said. “What in the actual fuck?”

“I’m sorry, dear. I’ve just been so very lonely," she said. 

"You should have told us you were. We would have come visit more.”

“For a little while you might have, sure. But my Mindy's here all the time….”

“Couldn’t you have just gotten a cat?”

“You know that I’m more of a dog person.” She let out an awkward laugh.

I made my way up the stairs, hiding my injury. I hugged my mother-in-law and held her close for a minute.

“You need to get rid of that...thing,” I said. “Somebody might get hurt. You need to call the local authorities or something.”

“She has been…a little off lately. But I think it’s just the heat.”

“You know damn right well it’s not just the heat, Marie.”

“I don’t give up on family…”

Outside, the sun was near its apex in the sky. Bright…too damn bright. It felt like the blood inside me was ready to boil.

Arnold was already in the car, letting it idle as he soaked up the air conditioning. He was tapping impatiently as I approached. I got in and closed the door behind me. My pinky stung with the vibration of the door’s closing.

“Well, it’s official,” Arnold said. “My mother has finally lost her God-damn mind.”

“I think she’s just lonely.”

"Of course she is! I mean, who would want to be around *that*, absent some…filial duty.?”

“I don’t know,” I said, suddenly feeling a bit drained. I didn’t want to talk about this or any other subject with…him….

“And what’s with all the secrecy?”

“Because she…never mind….” I said.

“What, what is it?”

“Nothing.”

He pulled the car over to the side of the road.

“You’re going to tell me what’s going on right now!” he screamed. “Because I’ve had enough of this brinksmanship bullshit...”

He might have kept talking. In fact, I'm sure he did. I could hear the halo of his voice through the vibrations that grew inside me. But in time, he seemed to fade. And when I looked at him next, all I could think was…

How tasty his flesh would be when I bit his fucking face…
