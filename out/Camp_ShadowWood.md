I thought this was over, I thought the case went cold. For twelve agonizing years, I buried it. Not just in my memories, but deep within my very bones, a chilling ache that I actively suppressed. So deep, in fact, that I managed to convince myself it was nothing more than a fever dream, a grotesque hallucination spun from the anxieties of a scared, introverted kid with an overactive imagination. But now, the ice in my veins is melting, and the nightmare is clawing its way back to the surface. And God help me, it's worse than I ever remembered.

I'm a cop now, twenty-eight years old, and my daily life is a grim procession of human misery. I've seen things that would curdle the blood of most people – accidents, violence, the raw aftermath of despair. But nothing, absolutely nothing, not even the most gruesome crime scene, has ever come close to the suffocating dread of the summer of '09. My parents, bless their well-meaning but utterly clueless hearts, were fed up with my perpetual computer screen tan. "Go outside, Peter! Get some fresh air! Make some friends!" they'd chirp, oblivious to the digital sanctuary I'd built. So, with a sigh that felt heavier than my fifteen-year-old frame, they shipped me off to Camp Shadow-wood, a name that even then sounded like a place where shadows lingered. It was deep in the Maine woods, shrouded in a perpetual twilight of ancient pines. The kind of place you had to cross this impossibly long, ancient, and perpetually creaking suspension bridge over a dizzying, fog-shrouded canyon just to reach. Each step on its rotting planks felt like a gamble, a descent into another world entirely.

The first few days were a blur of typical summer camp tedium. The food was bland, the crafts were pathetic attempts at macramé, and the days dragged on with forced activities. The only reprieve came at night, around a crackling, spitting fire, where we'd huddle together, telling the usual urban legends – the hook-handed killer, the vanishing hitchhiker, tales designed to elicit nervous giggles and feigned shivers. Then, one particularly muggy night, Counselor Mark took over. He was in his late twenties, but looked older, his face etched with something beyond his years. He was lean, almost gaunt, with eyes that seemed to absorb all the light, holding too much shadow even in the fire's dancing glow. His voice, when he began to speak, was a low, gravelly whisper that seemed to slither through the air, making the fine hairs on my arms prickle and stand on end.

"You kids think you know scary?" he began, his gaze, heavy and unblinking, sweeping over our young faces, lingering for a fraction too long on each one. "Let me tell you about Jericho."

He spun a tale about a boy named Jericho, a camper here at Shadow-wood, exactly twelve years ago. Jericho, he explained, was relentlessly bullied by another kid, a real piece of work named James. Mark's voice dropped even lower, becoming almost a conspiratorial hiss. One day, James, in a cruel act of malice, led Jericho deep into the most remote, tangled parts of the woods, and simply abandoned him there. "They searched for days," Mark whispered, leaning forward, his face illuminated by the firelight, making his features seem sharper, more predatory. "But they never found him. Not a trace. Just…gone. But they say," he paused, letting the silence stretch, thick and heavy, "you can still hear him. Yelling for help. Begging James to come back."

A few of the older, more cynical kids snickered. "Yeah, right, Mark," someone scoffed, trying to sound brave. "Sounds like something out of a bad horror movie."

Mark just smiled, a slow, unsettling stretch of his thin lips that didn't reach his eyes. "Oh, it's real," he murmured, his voice laced with an unnerving conviction. "Real enough that this camp closed down for twelve years. This," he gestured vaguely around the flickering fire circle, "this is our grand re-opening, you see. First time since Jericho vanished." He paused again, his shadowed eyes fixing on me with an intensity that felt like a physical touch, making my stomach clench into a tight, cold knot. "I was even here, back then. Knew James myself. Good guy." The last two words, "good guy," hung in the air, dripping with an irony that only I seemed to perceive.

My face must have gone ashen, betraying the icy fear that had just gripped me, because Travis, the resident bully who’d already made my life a living hell with his constant taunts and shoves, barked out a cruel laugh. "Look at Peter! Scaredy-cat!" A few other kids, eager to align themselves with Travis or just too nervous to stay silent, chuckled nervously. All I wanted was for the ground to open up and swallow me whole.

That night, the camp was eerily quiet, too quiet. The usual chirping of crickets and rustling of leaves seemed muted, swallowed by an oppressive stillness. I lay awake, staring at the ceiling of the cabin, every shadow a monster, every creak of the old wood a phantom footstep. Then, it came. A scream. Not a playful, fake scream designed for a campfire story. This was a raw, guttural sound, ripped from the depths of terror, that tore through the night like a physical thing, shattering the fragile peace. Everyone jolted awake, a cacophony of gasps and panicked whispers filling the cabin. Counselors were yelling, their voices sharp with alarm, and the beams of their flashlights cut frantic arcs through the inky darkness outside. Travis was gone.

The search was a chaotic, panicked nightmare. We fanned out, a disorganized mob of terrified kids and equally terrified counselors, calling his name, our voices hoarse and cracking with fear. Hours passed, each minute stretching into an eternity. The first faint streaks of dawn were just beginning to paint the eastern sky with a sickly, bruised purple when someone found it. In the communal ice chest, chilling next to bags of ice and soda cans, was Travis's head. Just his head. His eyes were wide open, staring blankly, frozen in a silent scream. His body was never found.

Counselor Mark was arrested on the spot, his face still blank, devoid of any emotion. He didn’t resist, just stared straight ahead as the handcuffs clicked into place. As the local police car, with Mark in the back and a veteran deputy driving, started across that old, rickety bridge – the very bridge that had felt like a gateway to another world – it happened. The car didn't swerve to avoid something. It veered. A deliberate, sharp, impossible turn. Right off the side. It plunged into the dizzying depths of the canyon below, a sickening, drawn-out crunch of metal and splintering wood echoing up from the abyss.

No trial. No suspect. The case went cold, buried under layers of official reports and hushed whispers. Just like that.

I truly thought I’d locked it away, sealed it off. That the trauma, the sheer, mind-bending impossibility of it all, had been filed away in some forgotten, inaccessible corner of my mind. I built a life, a career, a semblance of normalcy. Until today.

My department got the call this morning. Camp Shadowwood. Re-re-opening. The irony was a bitter taste in my mouth. And then came the details: two new deaths. A fifteen-year-old "troubled" kid named Allen Walker, found in circumstances eerily similar to Travis. And a camp counselor. His name? James Sterling.

The same James. The one who left Jericho in the woods. The one Mark, with that unnerving smile, had called a "good guy."

I'm standing here now, a uniformed officer, looking at that bridge. They rebuilt it, of course. It looks sturdier, newer, the steel cables gleaming in the weak morning light. But I can still hear the phantom creak of the old planks beneath my boots. And I swear, I can hear a faint, desperate cry from the canyon below, carried on the wind. It’s not just Jericho anymore. It’s Travis. And now, Allen. And James. Their voices, a chorus of the damned, are calling to me.

I spent the last few days digging. Not officially, not on department time, but late nights, fueled by stale coffee and a growing dread. I pulled strings, called in favors, and navigated the labyrinthine archives of old police reports and medical examiner files. And then, in a dusty box labeled "Cold Cases - Unsolved," I found it. Jericho's file.

Jericho Vance. Age 13. Died of hypothermia. The report was clinical, detached, but the details were a punch to the gut. His body was found weeks later, deep in the woods, after the initial search had been called off. The file mentioned "significant post-mortem decomposition," "animal scavenging," and "insect activity." A closed casket funeral. The poor kid didn't even get a proper goodbye. Just a name on a file, a tragedy swept under the rug.

I've got it all now. The original reports, the witness statements from '09, the new incident reports from this week, and now, Jericho's file. It's all laid out on my kitchen table, a horrifying mosaic of death and despair. I can connect the dots, the chilling pattern. It's insane, I know. It sounds absolutely, certifiably insane. But I know what this is. I feel it in my bones. It's Jericho. His vengeful spirit, finally seeking its brutal retribution.

I'm supposed to take this to the Chief tomorrow. Present my findings. But what do I say? "Chief, I believe a thirteen-year-old ghost is decapitating bullies and counselors at Shadow-wood"? I'll be laughed out of the department. I'll lose my job, my career, everything I've built to escape that summer. They'll think I've cracked
