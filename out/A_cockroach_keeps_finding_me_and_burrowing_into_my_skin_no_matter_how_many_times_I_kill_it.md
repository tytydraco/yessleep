The first time I saw the cockroach, I jumped out of my seat. I’m not normally afraid of insects, but I was shocked it had made it that far up my arm without me noticing. I swatted it off. It hit the wall, it hit the ground. I felt a bit bad, I was so much bigger than it, how could it have known that a giant would perceive it as a threat?

It righted itself, and slowly crawled towards me. I watched and waited, thinking to myself, *why are you coming back to the thing that just hurt you?* It reached my foot, and the fear struck again.

I slammed my foot down and felt the thing crunch. I should probably have cleaned it up, but my room was a mess, and I had things to do. I walked back to my computer and kept drawing.

The next morning I woke up to a strange pain on my hip. I lifted up the blanket and saw it. Another cockroach was digging through my skin. I figure it was trying to burrow or something. I smacked it away, and ran to the kitchen. Digging under the sink I found the fly spray, but when I came back to my room the cockroach had gone. I figured since I was already up, I may as well give my room a clean. I filled my bin with loose cracker wrappers and old cans of Pals, and started to clean the stains of spilt drinks from my desk. I checked the floor for any stains and saw a single one. A patch of blood on the carpet, with some bug legs in it. *Where did yesterday’s cockroach go?* I figured one of the cats had eaten it or something, Genevieve was always eating moths and chasing flies. After vacuuming, I opened my door and the cockroach was sitting there, like it was waiting. It charged at me, but I was ready. Fight or flight hit, and I lunged for the fly spray, dousing it with half the canister’s worth of poison. It lay twitching on the carpet, pitifully. I wasn’t taking chances on this freak, so I plugged the vacuum cleaner back in and sucked the thing up. I took out the dust bag and chucked it in the bin on the street.

The stinging pain in my hip got worse throughout the night. Every time it throbbed, I threw the blankets back in panic and flicked on the light. Every time there was no cockroach in sight, but that was no reassurance. Phantom feelings of crawling tiny legs travelled every inch of my bare skin. And I found myself obsessively itching and searching through my blankets for any sign of the damn thing. I didn’t sleep much.

In the morning I kept seeing it out of the corner of my eye. My flatmate tapped me on the shoulder during one of my zone-outs and I nearly hit him. He asked if I was okay and I started telling him about the cockroach and how I hadn’t slept. He seemed to think work was stressing me out or it was PMS or something. That afternoon I finally crashed. I was asleep on the couch for hours before something woke me up. I felt like I was being watched, and my eyes tracked the feeling to a hole in the wall. *How long has that been there?* We used to have a painting covering it, apparently the flatmate who lived here before me used to have panic attacks so bad that he’d punch holes through the walls in a desperate attempt to ground himself. I reached into the hole, and fuck it hurt. Pulling out my hand I found the cockroach, swollen to about three times its size, and clamped hard onto the skin of my palm. I wondered if this is some kind of mutation, maybe they’re resistant to fly spray now, or it just makes them stronger. That night I googled “cockroach / tick hybrids”, “unkillable cockroach”, and in a moment of helpless desperation “help cockroach burrow in human skin sucks blood grows in size reddit”. I found fucking nothing. Hey, maybe posting this will help the next person who googles that. At least it’ll make them feel less alone.

It had been a few weeks since then, and every fucking morning, like clockwork I found this stupid fucking cockroach burrowing into my hip. It kept getting bigger, in increments small enough that it honestly took me a while to notice. The routine of it all had desensitised me to how messed up the situation was, and it wasn’t until the other day when my flatmate walked in on me getting changed that I realised I had to seriously do something about this. He never knocks, one of those people who grew up with siblings and helicopter parents who despised locked doors. He shouted in surprise, and at first I thought it was just the classic “Ahh! Tits!” so I scoffed at him and called him a prude. But he wasn’t staring at my chest, he was pale and couldn’t look away from my hip. “What the fuck is that!”. For the life of me I couldn’t bring myself to explain, I just burst into tears. He called my brother and the two of them spent the night trying to cheer me up. I explained to them what was happening but I could tell neither of them really believed me. They said I needed help, *so fuck it*, I thought, *I’ll help myself*.

Last night I broke into the vets and stole a cat microchip, the last time I’d taken Genevieve in for an appointment they had tried to sell me on this new GPS tracker app, so you can track your cat’s location if they go missing. I had made some joke about “Find My iCat” or something. I’m not proud of robbing them, they’ve always been kind to me. But, I couldn’t find anything available online, and with enough alcohol anything seems like a good idea.

This morning, when I woke up to the cockroach burrowing, I was ready. It had carved a 3 centimetre hole into my flesh at that point, but I knew the trick to getting it out. I pushed hard with two fingers on either side of the hole, and squeezed as I pulled the skin away from myself. The cockroach spilled out of me in a pool of my own blood. Before it could run, I stabbed the thing’s swollen abdomen and injected the microchip. I ran as soon as the syringe clicked into place. Moved the rest of my stuff into a storage unit, and left Auckland.

I drove for two hours and resisted the urge to check the Cat-Track app, I had Google Maps open anyway, and I’m not the kind of person to use my phone while driving.

I’m staying in a motel in Hamilton, and every fifteen minutes the GPS pings. It’s fucking following me. 4.7 kilometres per hour. Auckland and Hamilton aren’t that far away from each other, I’ve got about 24 hours before it gets here. Fuck, my hip is killing me. The skin around the hole is swollen and red raw. I tried to clean it when I got here, but sticking a tweezer that deep under my skin made me vomit.

I don’t know what to do. This fucking cockroach won’t die. *How does it know where I am?* If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it.

I think I’m just going to finish this drink and go to sleep, I can keep driving tomorrow. Work will understand, I’ll just say I’ve got covid or something.
