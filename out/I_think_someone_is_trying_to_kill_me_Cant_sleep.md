I’m 27.  Never really had a problem with other people and have always been quite well respected.
So long story short I was seeing a girl for a month, well I never slept with her just to put that into perspective.. I just met her and didn’t know what she was like so decided I need to know more about her. She took interest and I eventually said I’m not interested.. X time goes by and she’s really mad and jealous I rejected her. I understand that not often do women get rejected by men, maybe it was her first. 
Anyway fast forward one year, in the X amount of time of not dating her , she became really provocative and passive aggressive towards me with her new boyfriend. 

I’m an adult so I am responsible for doing the right thing. Me 27 him 19
Edit: I didn’t know his age, she was 30 or so years, so I thought the same. 
Anyway time goes by and the BF which I haven’t named anyone. But he has been winding me up all year, approaching me in the street in his car. It got to the point where I just had enough He tried to hit my girlfriend which at the time was the landlord to their property. They was asked to leave . And so I was angry 
I saw him one day buying food and so when I had the chance I Smacked him. He also hit me back which fair enough I’m not expecting him not to. I knew that would happen.


Fast forward to the next day. OP BF and his GF follow me home early hours  it’s roughly 3:30am and then blocks me in the road driving home. Then leaves and blocks me in outside my house for the second time. He was very agressive told me to get out of my car etc you get the point. For my own safety I avoided it and stayed in my car because if I was going to get out you know what’s going to happen.. I’d be leaving myself vulnerable. Anyway after making him calm down the aggression he had towards me we shook hands 3 times. He left and it was dealt with.
Fast forward a month or so he’s going to the club I go to on weekends. I always am respected by the people in the club since I am polite and have a good reputation.


Anyway last night they or them/ OP and BF got unbanned from the club. They are troublemakers and is why they were banned in the first place. So I’m in the club with my friends having a good time and with my girlfriend aswell  I then got advised I need to leave right now by my friends. I was like why? Well they where in the club. And knew I was there with my friends so they had people waiting outside for me to go outside so they can supposedly beat me up. I have respect with the club dj and security staff and they advised me to leave through the back as it wasn’t safe for me So we left as we left there was a 30 second window for me to dip out . Anyway got back to my car which I had a a piece of wood to defend my self with and my gf advised me to just leave it and drive home. That was the right thing to do but I was ready at the same time just in case he started following me. Anyway they couldn’t find me as I left. 

I have now had a think about the situation and am trying to De escalate it by not going places like the club fora good while  which is probably the right thing to do. He knows where I live but chooses to avoid my street  Unsure why but anyway.. I think this person is trying to kill me and I don’t know what to do next but lay low. He’s actually been following me here and there and I’m pretty sure somebody is telling
them where I am. Just to be one step ahead I have removed all followers on my social media and made it private for safety concernes that somebody is snaking me. I’m not scared of him but 5 on 1 in the street could have knives etc street fighting is not really a good idea anyway. Anyway I am starting to get quite paranoid that I wanted to consult Redditor’s  opinions. 

I have a pic of him I know his telephone number and he’s a drug dealer  if the information is worth being disclosed here. I am frantically worried since I went to get shopping the other day and I was followed by 3 cars. I think they are trying to kill me and the woman is completely nuts. It’s ruining my life and have reported him to police anonymously For selling drugs. What should I do because it’s startIng to worry me.
