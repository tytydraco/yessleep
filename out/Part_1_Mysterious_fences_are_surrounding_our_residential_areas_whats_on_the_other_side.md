All humans are raised in such a way as to make them ignorant of the true reality. From TV, to social media, porn, junk food, everything else is just a distraction, to keep people from questioning the world that they live in. For the most of my life, that's how I've been too. There are multiple false beliefs that they want you to believe. I'm just trying to open your mind to the possibilities.

Have you even thought about the fact that humans are allowed to live only in certain areas? Most of us live in the cities such as San Francisco, Hong Kong, Moscow, Seoul, Beijing, Tokyo, Jakarta, Melbourne. Then there is some area around these cities which are the suburbs and other small cities. Then around these big or small cities there is the countryside, where some of the people also live in villages or stand alone houses. The countryside is also where most of the food is grown.

Then beyond that are the various forests, woods, deserts, and other places where people do not typically live. Only a small percentage of the people live in these way off places. Sometimes if you drive through the boondocks, you might come among a village or two, a remote settlement with a mostly indigenous population, mostly old grandpas and grandmas, whose children and grandchildren have left for the exciting life in the big cities. Sometimes if you go even further into the wilderness you find a remote hut of a hermit, living by himself in the middle of nowhere.

I'm a traveler, a digital nomad, a citizen of the world. I've lived in Russia, China, Japan, Thailand, and the United States. And I tell you, in every country in the world, follows the same pattern. You have most of the population living in the big cities, and then it slowly tapers out. As you drive out of the cities, you first encounter the suburbs, then you get to the countryside. And as you go further and further away from the cities, the population gets thinner and thinner. You start getting into the wild areas of the country. Places where there are few humans, mostly wild animals, and the occasional remote hut of a hermit, hunter, monk, or doomsday survivalist with an underground bunker. This story is the same in Russia, in China, the United States, pretty much in every country that I've ever lived in.

I've always loved exploring these wild areas, untouched by modern civilization. For example in Central Siberia the Altai Mountains, the Sichaun Mountains in China, the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California, or the frigid forests of Canada. I've always loved to get away from the cities, exploring the woods, hunting, fishing, gathering, and just meditating in peace away from the hustle and bustle of civilization.

Several times I've tried to make treks on foot to see just how far into the woods I could go. I could go for several days on foot, pitching up a tent at night, then continuing hiking by day. Eventually I would get to a fence or a wall of some kind. In California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, I remember seeing a 12 foot tall fence, with a POSTED sign. And everywhere I see these fences. In Russia when I was in the Altai Mountains, I was taking a hunting trip on horseback, and eventually I got to a fence with the words "Government Land - Trespassing Punishable by Death". When I was backpacking through Manchuria, I came across a wall reminiscent of the Great Wall of China, even though I was several hundred miles from where the Great Wall should allegedly be. I saw a similar wall in Thailand, except made from red brick.

In every country there was a fence, or wall, or some kind of border keeping people from wandering further into the woods. Eventually if you went far enough, you couldn't go any farther. So after making several such trips to map out the fences, I started an online movement, with hundreds of people making independent excursions out of the cities, into the remote areas directly in their country/state, trying to find the fences. We were able to collect crowdsourced data points from hundreds of explorers in different countries all around the worlds, and plot them on the world map.

The conclusion was most astounding. Most of the planet is blocked off from the general public. I mean, you can go anywhere it's developed, like along the coastlines, in the agrarian areas, and some of the forests as well, but if you go far enough inland, you eventually hit a wall, fence, or some other artificial border. For whatever reason, they don't want you straying too far from the developed areas. We found that large amounts of Asia, North America, Africa, and Australia are completely fenced off.

We opened up a Discord group, and roughly after three months, we got a new member "ShadowClone" who gave us his theory about why these fences are there. According to this user, the geography of the planet that has been taught to us as children is simply wrong. Basically, maps around the populated areas, and around the coastlines are true. But the orientation of these few hundreds of populated regions relative to each other is a lie. ShadowClone said that we are free to move within a populated region, but if we want to move between different populated regions, then we have to travel along certain predefined paths, for example international flights, railroads, or the interstates. According to this user, there was no way of telling if these limited predefined paths are as long as they want you to think.

According to ShadowClone, the real purpose of these walls and fences was to keep the human population from discovering the truth, that the geography is actually different in real life. The true size and dimensions of the fenced off areas is indeterminate, they maybe smaller or larger than what is actually depicted on the map. The map by the way is fake, the fenced off areas and stretches of wide open ocean carefully hiding other lands that the human population just doesn't have access to. ShadowClone brought up a fact that all airplanes and all ships in the sea follow several predefined lines. And the open waters beyond those lines could conceal other lands. According to ShadowClone, the true size of the world is much larger in fact, and the map that we are seeing is just conveniently folded up.

So we aggregated all the data that we had, the known locations of the fences on land, as well as known locations of established air and sea travel lines. We drew on the map those lines with a red marker. Then we cut out the fenced off hinterlands or empty areas of the ocean. We were left with a couple dozen disjoint populated regions, usually around major cities and along the coastlines. Japan, most of Europe, and Southeast Asia together with Indonesia was left in one piece. But the other areas were totally isolated, except from predetermined roads, railroads, seaways, and airways, going through the empty fenced off areas without any population.

We found that we could rearrange all the coastlines of the world in an arbitrary amount of ways, by assuming different proportions for the hinterlands. The 30th cohesive layout that we discovered was very interesting, in that it was a completely circular layout, with all the water being on the inside of the circle, and the fenced in areas being on the outside. We found that all the populated areas of the world were like one big coastline stretching in a nearly circular manner, looping around itself, kind of like the Mediterranean Sea, except much bigger. We found that there is only one ocean, the top of which is frozen, the sides are temperate, the bottom sides are tropical, and then the far bottom is desert. Most of the major cities are close to the coastlines of this ocean, the rural agrarian areas further inland, the forests and deserts further inland still. And all the fenced in land was on the outside of the circle. None of the continents such as Asia, Africa, or the Americas exist, we're just living on the shores of one big ocean or lake, roughly circular in shape, and then there's land all around. Hence this layout explains why large portions of the land away. The fences are surrounding the human habitation zone all around.

We had to find out what lies beyond the fences. According to our model of the new world map, if you go out into what looks like the middle of North America, the middle of Asia or Siberia, the middle of Arabia, or the middle of Australia, you are actually going away from the center of the world the water in the middle, away from the human populated areas. Eventually you will hit one of those fenced off hinterlands.

That is why we have organized an expedition to see what lies beyond the fences. According to our projection, I-94 in the United States goes along the edge of the world, as does A87 in the middle of Australia, except that they are on opposite sides of the ocean. Seemingly straight, according to our projection, these roads roughly curve around the circumference of the world. And if you walk off the road in the direction where the sun sets, sooner or later you hit the fenced off hinterlands.

We're going on foot, and we will find a place where we can climb over the fence undetected. Then we'll hike for a week into the wilds, where no man has gone within the last 100 years or so, to discover what truly lies out there, and what they're hiding from us, and why they don't want humans going into those areas. We will be exploring the hinterlands, living off the land, hunting animals and what not. Like the pioneers, we will go and we will see what it's all about.

Do you readers have any tips for our expeditions? Has anyone been out beyond the fences, and returned to tell the tale? What do we have to expect? What kinds of dangers do we have to look out for? Is there anything that we should pack for our journey? Also, we haven't picked a particular place to explore yet. But if our projection is correct, most of the fenced out areas, roughly anywhere from four to ten areas driving away from the coastal cities, are indeed the hinterlands. Does anyone live close to the fenced off areas? Are the fences in your area unguarded or unmaintained, or short enough to climb over? We are looking for recommendations where to penetrate and start exploring.
