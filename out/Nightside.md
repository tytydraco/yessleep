I had this incredibly weird and vivid dream that left me unsettled even after waking up. It wasn’t like a typical nightmare, but something deeper—a world that felt wrong in every sense. The imagery, the darkness, and the way everything unfolded were so strange that it lingered with me long after. So, I decided to turn it into a story, giving it structure while sticking closely to what I experienced in the dream. The fear I felt in the dream was more about what was left unexplained, and I wanted to capture that in the writing.

Here’s how it played out: 

There’s a feeling I get sometimes when I look out my window at night—like the world’s been drained of something. It’s not the silence, not the dark, but something else. Something you can’t name but can feel deep down. It’s like the world isn’t asleep; it’s waiting.

I first felt that when I moved into my apartment. I never liked the place. The walls were too thin, the lights flickered, and the air always felt damp, no matter how long I ran the heat. It was cheap though and close to campus. Jayleen hated it too. She never said it out loud, but I could see it in her face every time she visited.

Jayleen still lived with her parents. She loved them, but I knew how much the weight of tradition hung over her—what was expected of her in their eyes. She didn’t mind the culture or the closeness, but it was hard for her to stay. I didn’t push her to move in with me. She wasn’t ready. Still, part of me thought that maybe, if we had a new place together, things would finally feel normal. Like that tension—the kind you don’t say out loud—would ease.

I told her this the last time she came over, her dark eyes scanning the peeling walls. “I just hate it here,” I said, more to fill the space than expecting a real response.

Jayleen opened her mouth to say something, but the sound cut her off. At first, I wasn’t even sure it was real—just this low rustling, too soft, too out of place. It was coming from the hallway.

Neither of us moved, but I could see Jayleen tense up, her eyes fixing on the door. The sound grew louder, not like footsteps, but more like something dragging itself along the floor. Slow. Deliberate.

I didn’t need to think, not really. It was as if something primal switched on inside me, the kind of instinct that doesn’t ask questions. My hand found hers, and in that second, I knew she felt it too. That deep, undeniable need to run.

Without speaking, we moved toward the window. There was no logic in what we were doing. Just that buzzing at the base of my spine, like every cell in my body screamed for me to get out.

The fire escape rattled as we climbed down. My car was parked below, and the thought of leaving this place—this cursed, oppressive apartment—pushed me forward. We slammed the doors shut as soon as we hit the ground, the sound of metal and glass vibrating in the quiet.

I started the car, the engine rumbling to life, but something made me pause. I didn’t know what, but I didn’t want to look back.

When I finally glanced in the rearview mirror, I wished I hadn’t.

It was there—a shadow, massive, on all fours, its shape barely registering. It wasn’t the kind of thing you could fully grasp. Its form…didn’t make sense. I couldn’t process what I was seeing, just this inhuman silhouette creeping toward us, like it was pulling itself through the darkness.

I slammed my foot on the gas.

The tires screeched as we flew down the street, the pavement barely visible beneath us. Jayleen clutched the door, her breath quick, but I didn’t dare take my eyes off the road. I couldn’t let myself think about what I’d seen—or if it was still following us.

The streetlights above us barely worked, casting only a faint purple glow that seemed swallowed by the darkness. The road stretched on endlessly, an abyss. It wasn’t like this before, not this empty. Not this dark.

Then, from nowhere, another car appeared.

It barreled down the road, headlights off, moving fast. I barely had time to react, swerving to avoid it, but instead of crashing into us, it rammed into the creature. The impact was deafening, the metal car crushing the shadow against a nearby building. I saw the black mass twist and contort, trapped between bricks and twisted metal.

I didn’t slow down. My heart pounded in my chest, and before I knew it, we were following the other car. It drove ahead of us, leading us deeper into the city.

It didn’t feel real—none of it did—but the car seemed to know where it was going, so I followed, the roads narrowing as we went. There were no signs, no lights, just an endless stretch of black, barely illuminated by the purple streetlights overhead.

Eventually, we reached a place—if you could even call it that. A fortress, built from the remains of old buildings and scrap metal. It looked thrown together, like the people there were holding off something much worse than the creature we’d just seen.

We pulled up, engines still running. There were people, but something about them was…wrong. At first, it was subtle. They looked like any other survivors—tired, worn out—but the way they moved…it didn’t seem right. Too slow. Like they weren’t used to their own bodies.

Jayleen leaned closer, her voice low. “Something’s off.”

I felt it too. It wasn’t just the way they moved—it was their eyes. Too blank, too far away. Like they were watching something inside their own heads, not us.

A man came forward, his body stiff, his arms hanging unnaturally by his sides. He motioned for us to follow, leading us toward the entrance of what looked like a crevasse carved into the fortress walls.

But I couldn’t move. Jayleen’s hand tightened around mine, and I knew she felt it too—this instinct telling us not to go inside. I kept the engine running, the hum of the car grounding me.

The man disappeared into the shadows, but then, from the corner of my eye, I saw him reappear. He didn’t walk back. He was just there, standing at the edge of the wall, his limbs spread out, too stiff, too unnatural. His head tilted, eyes wide but empty, locking onto us in that same blank stare.

Neither of us waited. I floored it.

The tires screeched again as we shot forward, speeding down the road, the fortress falling away behind us. I glanced in the rearview mirror, expecting to see him chasing us, but he wasn’t. He was just standing there, arms and legs outstretched, his body frozen in that same uncanny pose, watching us as we disappeared into the dark.

The road stretched on, nearly invisible except for the faint purple glow of the streetlights above. The world around us was quiet, too quiet. Jayleen was silent beside me, her face pale in the dim light, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that we hadn’t escaped.

That nothing escaped from this place.

Let me know what you think!
