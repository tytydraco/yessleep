From the moment I dipped my toes in the ocean as a child, I felt an eerie connection to the water. By nineteen, I was determined to make it to the national swimming team. But my life took a horrifying turn when strange, fish-like scales began to appear on my skin.

At first, it was just a small, glittering patch on my forearm. I dismissed it as a skin condition, but the scales quickly spread, covering my arms, legs, and back. My reflection became a grotesque reminder of my descent into something unnatural.

As the scales spread, so did an insatiable hunger. I found myself craving raw meat and even blood. My appetite became a ravenous obsession. I started sneaking raw steaks and fish, but it wasn't enough. I began to experience an unsettling craving for blood, a primal urge that gnawed at me constantly.

The transformation didn’t stop there. The cravings grew more intense and uncontrollable. I could sense the warmth and scent of blood from a distance, and the urge to taste it became unbearable. My once-clear vision became sharper, and I found myself grappling with an insidious, monstrous hunger.

Despite my best efforts to hide my condition from everyone, my best friend, Mia, was growing increasingly concerned. I knew I couldn’t keep the truth from her forever. One evening, I invited her over, hoping to confide in her and seek her help.

“Mia, I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice trembling as I revealed the scales. “This isn’t just a skin condition. I’m craving raw meat and blood. I don’t know what’s happening to me.” Mia’s eyes widened with a mix of fear and concern. “Emma, this isn’t normal. We need to find out what’s causing this.”

As we delved into old myths and legends, uncovering a horrifying story about a cursed mermaid with an insatiable hunger, I felt a terrifying clarity. My transformation was more than just physical—it had awakened a monstrous side of me that demanded satisfaction.

The cravings reached a breaking point. I could no longer control the dark impulses within me. One night, I lured Mia to an abandoned warehouse, pretending it was part of our investigation into my condition.

“Mia, I found something you need to see,” I said, leading her inside. The warehouse was dimly lit, the shadows playing tricks on the eyes. My heart pounded as the hunger within me grew unbearable.

Mia looked around, uneasy. “Emma, what is this place?”

Without warning, the hunger took over. I pounced on Mia, my instincts driving me to consume her. Her screams echoed through the warehouse, but they were quickly silenced as I gave in to the ravenous urge. The act was horrifyingly satisfying, the blood and flesh a twisted relief from the torment of my cravings.

Afterward, I staged the scene to make it look like a crime of passion. I left evidence implicating Mia’s boyfriend, Jake, in her death. I knew it would be a fitting end to a dark chapter in my life, and Jake’s desperation would divert suspicion away from me.

The following day, Jake was arrested, and the police quickly moved to charge him with Mia’s murder. The news spread quickly, and the weight of my actions settled heavily on my conscience, but the hunger within me was sated, if only temporarily.

My transformation was complete. The scales that once marked me as a victim of a curse had become a dark symbol of my new, monstrous identity. The water, my sanctuary and prison, became the backdrop for my new life, where I roamed the shadows, forever changed by the curse that had awakened the darkest part of me.
