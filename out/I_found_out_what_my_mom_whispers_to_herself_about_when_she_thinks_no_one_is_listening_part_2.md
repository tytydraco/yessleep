[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i4x9mz/my_mom_whispers_to_herself_at_night_when_she/)

The following morning was awkward, to say the least. My mom casually asked why I had been in her bedroom the night before, and all I could muster up was:

“I wanted to ask you if I could borrow the car today.”

She sighed. I sensed she didn’t believe me.

“Sure, honey. Just don’t take too long. I need it by tonight.”

I nodded silently.

My mom then said, without looking up from her book, “Are you sure there’s nothing else you want to talk about? You know you can always talk to me, right?”

Her voice was calm, but there was an edge to it—a sharpness that felt misplaced. Her gaze lingered a second too long, making my skin crawl.

My dad took notice of the tension and shifted uncomfortably in his chair.

“No, Mom, really. I just needed to borrow the car.”

She finally looked up and held my gaze for an excruciatingly long time before she spoke.

“You know, you’ve been acting strangely.”

I almost choked on my coffee. *I’ve been acting strangely?*

I felt a strong urge to confront her about everything I’d heard. About the whispers. All of it. But then I realized how insane it would have sounded: *My dead sister and mom whispering to each other?*

My dad would take her side, surely. They might even have committed me. Was that her… their goal?

I felt like a moth pinned to a board under her stare, squirming under the weight of her unspoken accusations.

“I’ve been stressed lately,” I said finally. “I still have trouble finding a job. It wears me out a little.”

Her face was unreadable, but it felt like she was smirking behind her neutral gaze.

“Sure, I understand, but please don’t feel like a failure. Everyone falls on hard times.”

I got up and left. “I never said I felt like a failure.”

I heard her sigh as I left the uncomfortable conversation behind.

I couldn’t risk spying on her again, but I couldn’t just wait for whatever horrifying plan they had in store for me. Whatever punishment they felt I deserved.

At that point, I remembered my grandma’s warnings. I remembered how my mother had cut her off. Written her off as a superstitious oddball.

Considering everything, it now seemed I might do well listening to her for once.

I had already gotten permission to borrow the car, so I decided to go see her.

Grandma lived on the other side of town in a parcel house. Her front yard was overgrown with weeds. Clearly, she had gotten too old to tend to it herself.

I felt bad. It was my mom’s decision to cut her off, yet the rest of us followed her lead without much question. It had been years since I visited her.

When I rang the bell, a sudden rush of nostalgia came over me as I heard the tune playing: *“Oh, when the saints go marching in…”*

I remembered then, despite her oddities, how much I had enjoyed spending time with her before Hol died.

She invited me in with a smile on her face. If she was angry with me for not visiting more, it didn’t show.

The state of her house was in similar condition as her front yard—a mess. Boxes, trinkets, old souvenirs, and religious and occult objects flooded the place. The air inside was heavy, tinged with the faint metallic scent of old coins and something sour that I couldn’t place. Shadows seemed to pool in the corners of the room, too deep for the weak light to penetrate. I suddenly felt watched from the dark corners.

I sat, not knowing what to say, but it seemed she knew better than me.

“You look tired, dear.”

I sighed and mustered up the energy to ask.

“You once said this family had a history of tragedy. Like some kind of curse.”

She nodded. “Your mom and I never saw eye to eye on that. She wouldn’t hear it. I suppose she thought I was a superstitious old hag.” She chuckled, but her eyes betrayed her.

“Maybe I am. But we are who we are.”

I looked around at the strange symbols and objects that hung on her walls.

“Can you tell me about it?”

Her eyes lit up as if she’d been waiting for someone to ask her, yet she seemed worried too.

“Simon, dear, is something wrong?”

I paused.

“I think I’m cursed.”

She looked at me, and suddenly her expression changed into one of deep concern.

"‘It’s found you, hasn’t it?’ she whispered, almost as if the words themselves could summon something from the shadows."

I swear it felt like the whispers were now inside my head, echoing and bouncing off the walls of my skull.

*“You’re not getting away. You’re not getting away. She can’t help you.”* They grew louder, overlapping and swirling together until they became a cacophony of taunts. Words I couldn’t fully grasp burrowed into my mind like claws.

I did my best to ignore it.

“What is it?”

Grandma sighed. “Something as old as time, I suppose. Causing rifts between people, breaking you down slowly. It wants to be you. Wants you to think it’s you.”

I felt unease in my entire body.

“I don’t understand.”

She placed a hand on my shoulder.

“It took your uncle. Before that, it took your grandfather. Even before that. Accidents, deaths, tragedy.”

I felt more confused than ever.

“Didn’t my uncle take his own life? I—”

Grandma interrupted.

“It made him do it. It whispered in his ears. That’s what it does, you know. It whispers when it doesn’t scream. Your uncle didn’t just take his own life,’ Grandma said, her voice dropping to a whisper. ‘He was... hollowed out. Like something had scooped out his will and left him an empty shell.’"

I had come looking for answers, but I was left more confused than ever.

“Why does it use my sister’s voice? I don’t understand.”

Grandma sighed.

“Only you know the answer to that. I can’t help you fight it. I can’t take you on this journey. I can only show you the door. It knows you, and it will use that against you. It knows your fears. Your insecurities. It will take everything you love and turn it into something ugly. Tell you that you are to blame for this. Once you’re weak enough, it will come for you, come to finish you off.”

She got up and started going through some old stuff. She found what looked like a wooden trinket—a circle with strange markings on it.

She handed me the carved circle, its surface covered in strange markings. ‘Wear this,’ she said, her voice trembling. ‘But remember—this can’t save you. Only you can do that.’

I was floored.

“How do you fight something like that?”

She took my hand.

“You know. Look into yourself, and you’ll know.”

Her touch brought me back in time.

Hol was there. We were playing hide and seek in Grandma’s house. It was just before Christmas, and the smell of cinnamon was everywhere. I had searched for Hol for what felt like hours.

Suddenly, I heard a wailing. I followed the sound until I found her in the playhouse out in Grandma’s backyard. She had accidentally locked herself inside.

“You didn’t find me. I thought you’d left me. I thought...”

And just like that, I was back in the room with Grandma.

I felt tears welling up.

“I can’t do this alone. Ever since Hol died, things have... Mom hates me. Dad doesn’t even care enough to hate me. I know it.”

Grandma shook her head.

“You can, and you will. You’re not alone, but this one thing—this one thing—you must do alone. You must look into yourself as you confront it. Reject its truth and find your own.”

I was on the verge of giving up.

“I don’t know how to do that.”

She gently grabbed my shoulder.

“You’ve forgotten so much, haven’t you? I can’t help you see it, but maybe I can show you the way. Look in your parents’ attic. There’s a yellow, faded box up there. Find it. Maybe it will help you remember. Help you see what you need to see.”

I felt defeated. Hopeless, yet determined to keep fighting.

As I got up, I stopped for a moment.

“Grandma? What really happened between you and Mom? Why don’t you talk?”

She looked at me. Her eyes were old and tired.

“Things were said. We both said things we shouldn’t have said. Your mom and I... we’re very different, dear. People handle tragedy differently.”

I nodded and headed for the door.

“Simon, dear?”

I stopped.

“Remember what I said.”
