I will never go back in that forest

Hi my name is Mark and i have a shitty life when i turned 18 i moved out of my parents house i lived with my cousins in america for 2 years untill they kicked me out when i was 20 i bought an RV with a lot of financial help from my parents but i knew i cant live with no money i looked for some jobs then found a job for a "Fire lookout".


Its easy you have to live in a fire tower and wait till a fire burst out the only downside of the job is beacuse u have to be alone for a long time to me that was not an problem since i lived in my RV for 3 years now so now im used to it my boss jack said to park my RV on the parking and there should be a sherif his name is ben.


Before i came my friend said that i should stop at a fast food place i didnt i had no time to eat
when i came i parked my RV and went into a little house there ben jumpscared me he had a big shotgun in his hand and before i could talk he said "oh my god you scared me i tought u were one of them" i said that he gave me a heart attack
He asked me why am i here i said im the new fire lookout he asked me for a id i gave him and then gave me keys for the tower and flashlight as i walked deep into the forest i felt like something 
was watching me.


I was here i saw the tower it was cold and scary so i quickly turned on the generator and went up
I unlocked the door and it turned on the light it was cozy and i felt safe here i quickly booted up the computer read the rules and then i heard the radio bepping i but on the headset and ask "who is this?"and then a person said that his name is daniel he said he is from tower 9 and said that he saw the tower light up he gave me a tip to take some wood form the shed downstairs and light it up since its going to be really cold out there i said "ok"it was not okay i did not want to go down there its was dark but daniel was right its going to br really cold so i quickly went down grab some wood light up the fireplace.


After that i did a report and made some food
And went to sleep i wondered what did ben mean by "i tought you was one of them" next morning i did my normal work drank a cup of coffe then daniel told me that he sees campfire smoke 
So i grabbed my flaslight and bearspray 
And went on a hike it was about 8:30
When i arrived i heard a loud scream i saw that the camp was empty i heard and saw something in the woods i said loudly "show yourself" i didnt move i went back to my tower.


When i came i told daniel what happend he didnt belive me and said it might be a red fox i made some food as usual want back to get some wood 
But then i met some person he said he is working on a comunitcation tower he said some strange words i told daniel about it and he said that tower 
was struck by lighting and that it didnt work for 10 years he said that whoever i wa talking to wasnt a worker after that i felt scared i ate some leftovers and went to sleep i woke up at 2:28.


I saw a figure watching me i pretended i was asleep when it left i found some kind of ritual at the door place i removed it but i couldnt sleep till morning i did the work read a book drank coffe untill somone knocked on my door it was ben he gave me supplies and gave me a tip if i see something strange get evidence of it with a camera i said okay next few weeks was alright until i saw something strange it was a fire at the lake i zoomed in with binoculars and i saw some humans dressed like they worship devil they where burnig a human i had to take a photo.


Since it was the 90 the camers had a flas when you take a picture and it was night i quickly took a photo and they saw a flash i runned up and hid under the bed then someone came into my tower but zhey didnt find me when they left i made a run for it got in my RV and drove off knowing i will never go back to these woods police begen to search but they found nothing family called me insane but i knew what i saw.
