The first knock comes at 2:07 AM. Three quick taps, then silence. Di-di-di.  
  
I almost miss it over the hum of my laptop fan and the soft clicks of my mechanical keyboard. The code on my screen—a particularly nasty bug in the authentication module—has kept me up well past any reasonable hour. But those three taps cut through the night, clearly.  
  
I moved into this apartment after quitting my tech company job. Working remotely has made life more fluid, but something feels missing... Even at midnight, coffee remains my only roommate.The cold Americano slides down my throat like liquid metal, hitting my empty stomach with a nauseating splash. I should eat something, but the bug I've been chasing for the past six hours has consumed every ounce of my attention. My head buzzes with that peculiar static that only developers know - the kind that comes from staring at lines of code until they start swimming across your screen like digital serpents. The LED strip behind my monitor bathes everything in an unnatural blue glow, making my skin look corpse-like in its reflection on the dark screen.When I finally force myself to move, my spine protests with a series of sharp cracks that sound disturbingly organic in the dead silence of my apartment. Crack-crack-crack.

Then it comes again. Di-di-di.  
  
The pattern is precise, mechanical almost. Each tap exactly 0.5 seconds apart, by my developer's internal clock. The same clock that helps me debug race conditions and optimize loading sequences.  
  
I minimize my IDE and pull up the building's tenant portal. Third floor, west wing. The renovation notice from management mentioned that the entire floor except my unit would be empty for the next three months. Something about asbestos removal and structural repairs. Perfect for a remote worker who codes better in silence, I'd thought at the time.  
  
Less perfect now.  
  
The knocking changes. Di-di-di... pause... di-di.  
  
My heart rate spikes. I grab my phone and start recording, muscle memory from debugging sessions kicking in. Document everything. Track the pattern. Find the logic.  
  
The building creaks, settling into the night. Through my window, twelve stories of the opposite wing stare back with dark windows. The maintenance guy, mentioned during the walk-through that only 20% of the units are currently occupied. "Renovation's driving everyone out temporarily," he'd said, adjusting his worn baseball cap. "But hey, quiet's good for some folks."  
  
Too quiet now.  
  
I check the peephole. The hallway stretches empty in both directions, emergency exit signs casting a dim red glow. Something seems off about the door's surface. I lean closer, squinting through the fish-eye lens.  
  
There are smudges around the peephole's outer rim. Fresh ones.  
  
My hands shake as I open a new browser tab and search: "pattern knocking night apartment." The results flood in—mostly ghost stories and urban legends. But one Reddit thread catches my eye: "Strange knocking patterns in empty buildings - A compilation of cases."  
  
The top comment makes my blood run cold:  
  
"Security expert here. Be careful with pattern knocks. Some burglars use them to check occupancy. They knock in specific sequences, document response times. If you respond immediately, they know someone's home and awake. No response means either empty or sleeping. They build patterns over days."  
  
I scroll through more comments, my throat tightening:  
"Had this happen in Chicago. Three quick knocks, then two. Turned out to be guys casing the building."  
"Check your door frame for tiny marks. They sometimes use UV markers."  
"If it follows a specific pattern, document everything. Time stamps, sequence variations."  
  
The knocking returns. Di-di-di... pause... di-di... longer pause... di.  
  
I grab my laptop and retreat to the bedroom, closing and locking the door behind me. The building's Wi-Fi signal shows five other connections active at this hour. Five out of forty-eight units. I pull up the building's floor plans from my lease documents, marking occupied units based on lit windows I've observed.  
  
A pattern emerges. All occupied units are scattered, isolated. Like mine.  
  
My phone buzzes. A notification from the tenant portal:  
"MAINTENANCE NOTICE: Lock mechanism inspection scheduled for all units. Date: Tomorrow, 9 AM - 5 PM."  
  
The knocking stops. Complete silence follows, somehow worse than the sound. I check the time: 2:09 AM. Exactly two minutes of activity.  
  
I won't sleep tonight. Instead, I open a new document and start logging everything. The knock patterns. The timing. The maintenance notice. The smudges.  
  
Something about this feels orchestrated. Precise. Like a program running its execution cycle.  
  
And I have a terrible feeling this is just the initialization sequence.

Can't sleep now. What can I do to stop the sound?
