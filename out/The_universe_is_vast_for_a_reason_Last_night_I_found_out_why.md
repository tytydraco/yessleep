Kids are so silly. It’s kind of funny how they worry about irrational things like quicksand, or the Bermuda Triangle.

Don’t you remember having irrational expectations as a kid? I do.

I used to think that I’d one day get the opportunity to travel throughout the universe in an epic, sci-fi spaceship—like in the movies. I would imagine myself wearing a decked out spacesuit, with a laser blaster at my hip, chasing after enemy alien ships…

Young me genuinely believed that technology would easily advance to that level within my lifetime.

To be a kid is to be irrationally hopeful.

Like everyone else, I eventually learned that the universe, let alone our Milky Way galaxy, is simply far too vast for humans to ever plausibly hope to traverse. A bit of a letdown, but I came to terms with that fact a long time ago.

I’ve always wondered just how vast the universe is. Not once have I bothered asking why it's as vast as it is. Well, last night, I found out that there is indeed a reason.

I usually do a few things around my apartment after coming home from work: dishes, laundry, basic stuff. Not last night; I was feeling a bit under the weather so I went straight to bed.

I must have fallen into an incredibly deep sleep. When I first opened my eyes, I thought I was dreaming. I was wrong. I’ve never experienced astral projection before, but for the first time, I believe I had.

How do I know it was astral projection? Because the first thing I remember seeing was my own unconscious face as I hovered over my still, seemingly lifeless body.

In an attempt to get a better view, I tried backing up a bit and instead watched as my astral body launched straight out of the atmosphere. It was astoundingly effortless.

I couldn't believe my eyes. I was witnessing planet Earth in all its glory as the sun enveloped it in its powerful ultraviolet rays. That’s another thing: I could see the rays too.

*How fascinating*, I thought. *What else might be out there for me to see?*

I first began wandering throughout our solar system, and before long, the Milky Way. I must have been moving at hundreds of thousands of light years in just moments. It felt no different than taking a stroll through a park.

I fell through Jupiter; through the eye of its giant storm; through its semi-solid core as well.

I flew alongside comets, danced around Saturn’s asteroid belt, and watched in awe as a distant star collapsed into a black hole.

I don’t know how long I was out there for. A few minutes? A few hours? I must have gotten carried away, strayed too far from the sun, so to speak.

It only took a moment for me to see that I had somehow traversed all the way to the edge of the universe.

*I guess it’s not as vast as I thought.*

I wasn’t sure what I would find here. There wasn’t much to look at, a whole lot of nothing actually. I figured it was time to wrap up the fun.

As I prepared to launch myself back to Earth, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye.

*That’s odd. There’s not supposed to be anything else out here… but there is something… out there.*

I’ll call it what it was: a door. Not like the kind of door you can grab by the handle and physically open, but rather, an opening to a different place.

In this case, it was a door leading out of the universe.

I stared hesitantly at the doorway, uncertain of what lay beyond it.

*I shouldn’t, right? I should definitely go back home, to my body. It probably misses me, after all.*

I turned about halfway before that inevitable rush of curiosity stopped me.

*I have to take a peek. How could I not?*

As I approached the doorway, I closely observed the way space and time seemed to ripple out from it. Strings of light and energy spewed from it like spaghetti.

*If I were to physically touch this thing, I’d surely be pulled apart until there was nothing left.*

*I guess it’s a good thing I left my body back home.*

I proceeded to phase through the entryway effortlessly, my ethereal body feeling the tickle of the spaghetti rays. As I went through, I could have sworn I saw a mirror of myself staring back at me, as if another me was going through the doorway at the same time, but in the opposite direction.

Before I knew it, I was back in my bed, wide awake.

“As strange as that all was, maybe it was just an incredibly lucid dream,” I said to myself. That was more or less my view on the situation, until I took a closer look around my bedroom.

It was my bedroom… except, it wasn’t.

I looked closely at my bulletin board. There were pictures of me, by myself, next to family, but also next to people I had never met before, kissing a woman I had never seen in my life…

I got up to go wash my face, but something felt off, as if my body wasn’t mine. Looking into the bathroom mirror, I saw myself.

I saw a version of myself, to be more concise.

Staring back at me from the mirror was undeniably me, but roughly twenty pounds heavier, unshaven, and in place of my usual mid-length brown hair, laid a mop of oily black hair that reached past my neck.

It’s been two hours since then. I’m still here, in this body that isn’t mine.

I’ve come to realize that I know nothing about this me or his life, and that it is in my best interest to get back to my real body as soon as possible.

I’ve tried going back to sleep in hopes that I could somehow astral project again and find my way back to the doorway, but no luck yet. I’m trying my best not to freak out right now, trying to look at the positive side of all this.

I don’t have a Reddit account, but this me does. I’m using his account to upload my story in hopes that one of you will have some advice as to how I can get back home to my world.

I’m open to any suggestions.
