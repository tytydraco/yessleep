Everyone has heard or seen the videos that's going around on tiktok, if you haven't let me tell you about it. Women would rather choose being alone in the woods with a bear than with a man. And that's for the simple fact that the worst thing the bear could do to a woman is kill them. A man could do and would do so much worse to a woman alone in the woods. 

This is my story.

I'm a regular hiker. I always have been, I love nature, I love the serenity and the peace being at one with nature brings to me, it helps me connect better with myself and it brings me joy to be able to put on my boots, pack a bag and go for a lovely long walk.

I first saw the tiktoks a week ago, it started with an interview, a man approaching women in the street and asking them then same question and the answer was mostly the same. "Would you rather be alone in the woods with a man or a bear" most of the women said bear, it was a complication of the women saying bear. Near the end a few said a man simply because they didn't want to be killed by a bear. I found myself saying bear with them. It comes to something when a bear is less scarier than a man. I read the comments and what I read shook me to my core. There was some personal stories about how they would choose the bear because the bear wouldn't rape them. That one hit me the most after being a victim of rape myself. There was some about how they would choose the bear because when they was a child and they got S/A by a man in the family, a bear wouldn't do that to them. It's horrible. And I agree, the worst thing a bear could do to me would be to kill me to feed themselves or their cubs. I would rather have that, than be someone else's sick fantasy. 

It was a Tuesday. A beautiful sunny day, the first proper sunny day of the year, it felt right so I went out to my usual hiking spot. I was excited to have the day to myself as I don't work Tuesdays. I told my mum that I'm hiking today so I would message her when I was finished and we could have dinner together, as we usually did once a week. 

That didn't happen.

As I sat on my car seat doing up my boots I took a long inhale of the fresh, crisp countryside air. It felt amazing. I felt amazing for a few seconds, I closed my eyes and just breathed. I felt the stress of things pause for a moment. A sweet release. I finished doing up my boots, grabbed my bag and followed my usual trail. 

As I was walking I encountered some older couples enjoying the same bliss I was, some brief pleasantries were exchanged and our days continued. 

I stopped for a rest about 3 miles in as I usually do, checked my watch to see how I was doing for my steps and how long it took me to walk and congratulated myself for being 5 minutes faster than my previous walks. It doesn't seem like much and I'm not too serious about it but a mini accomplishment here and there feels good. There's a small old wall that I leaned up against and took in the scenery, blissful vast surroundings of pure green, no clouds in the sky and the sound of birds singing felt more tranquil than usual. I had some of my water and decided to carry on. Up ahead it starts to get more forestry and dense so I started to head that way. 

Within a few hundred feet I heard a strange noise. I stopped dead in my tracks as the only sound I had heard were my own footsteps and birdsong. I scanned the treeline and couldn't see anything. I looked behind me and still couldn't see anything, I paused for a few more minutes, my heartbeat in my ears, I took a few deep breaths and composed myself and told myself if I heard the noise again then something was definitely going on. I continued on for another hundred feet or so before I heard the noise again. 

It was a growl. A strange growl, something unlike I had ever heard before. It didn't sound like it came from any animal you would find that's native to the UK. I stopped and looked around again but couldn't see anything, I pulled out my phone but with no signal I couldn't google to double check the animals natural to this area. Putting my phone back in my pocket I saw something at the corner or my eye.

I heard the growl again. 

I panicked I didn't know what to do, I saw it clear as day, it stood up on its hind legs. Nearly 9ft tall and ready to kill me. 

My mind was racing, I'm on a trail in the UK where bears aren't native. I didn't know what to do I stood there trembling as the bear started hurling towards me when the bear rule suddenly popped into my head. If its brown lay down. I quickly laid down hoping the bear would forget about me. 

It felt like i was laying down for hours but it had only been minutes, I heard the bear still galloping towards me, I was worried that although I was laying down was my bag too bright and it would still attack me? I had no idea if they could see in colour but my bright purple bag felt like I was a walking target or a laying down one. As I laid there all of a sudden the bear stopped. 

I could taste blood from biting my tongue so hard, I tried not to breathe and felt my whole body ache from being so stiff. I didn't hear the bears footsteps retreat so I assumed it was lingering over me. Then all of a sudden it picked me up.

It dragged me away into the woods further and further off the trail. I was screaming and trying to kick and scratch my way out of the bears grip to no avail. It had been ages since I saw another person on the trail and they was heading away from where I was going so I felt the dread of being eaten and not being rescued. I knew what was going to happen to me. My screaming was smothered by the forest. The bears hot breath was down my neck, I started to accept my fate. I was this bears dinner. 

I was dragged into a makeshift cave, the bear tossed me around and I landed on a rock, my head hit the rock and split open. I was conscious but weary. My vission was blurred I lost my glasses in the struggle. It wasn't until the bear stood still, panting that it's body relaxed it reached up to its head and removed its head. I was trying to make sense of it all, it was all a blur but I saw the bear take its head off. Then it spoke in a gruff voice "you're alone in the woods, you've had the bear, now you're alone with me".
