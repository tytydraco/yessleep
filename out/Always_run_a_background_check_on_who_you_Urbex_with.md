If anybody is curious about urban exploration, entering abandoned buildings and poking around a bit, I can definitely endorse it: just understand the risks.

We all know the basics: power means it may still be operational, don't get caught by security, always know your exit. If you ask me, just don't be stupid, you'll probably be fine.

But for God's sake, please vet whoever it is you're exploring with. I don't care how long you've known them. I don't care how many times you've gone out with them before. People are mysterious. People are strange. Being with somebody in such a dangerous place, and normally such a remote place, is an inherent risk - so do your homework! Much better than the alternative.

Room 302 of Pennsylvania State Lunatic Hospital is a dusty, crusty, musty shithole. Nobody has used it for almost half a century, and whoever lived in it last is probably dead by now. None of that changes the fact it is a dust-ridden, filthy armpit, and I'm so tired of it.

I've been sitting on the floor, staring at the walls, for an hour now.

Liam closed the door at 5:15pm. It's now just around 6:30pm, and I see no prospect of leaving tonight. You're probably thinking, '*Jesus, OP seems pretty calm, being shut away in a crumbling concrete box'*, but the truth is, I've burned myself out by panicking. I've gotten to a point where the adrenaline has fried my every receptor, every crease in my brain, and I'm sitting on the floor of Room 302 in bitter resignation.

Somewhere, rustling around in my skull, is a distant daydream: an idea that some version of me, the lucky one, is at home right now with their feet up and Netflix blasting. The car is parked out front of my apartment complex and not just outside of the building, with its keys on my kitchen counter and not in the pocket of the asshole I came here with.

Matter-of-fact, I hear shuffling around every now and again, so he's still out there. I'm just hoping the bastard snaps out of it and lets me go. Crazy to think I met this guy at a fucking nightclub and decided, in my infinite wisdom, to run around an abandoned hospital with him. In my defence, we met *months* ago, and he's always been the sweetest and most understanding guy I've met in a long time.

Fuck, if I wasn't so busy with school I'd have asked him out.

The point is, I thought I was a good judge of character, and I figured him to be a good person. It’s why I even asked him to tag along. Even on the drive here, we were geeking out about how exciting this would all be. He does photography, you see, so he's sat there in the passenger seat of my car, adjusting all the lenses and doo-dads on that camera of his; all the while, he's talking on and on about how good these photos would look on his page and I can tell he's genuinely on the edge of his seat. Yeah. He must've been thrilled as we drove further and further into the isolating wilderness.

Angry at the memory, I scrape myself off the floor and walk toward that big, reinforced door. I pound against it three times.

"Hey, asshole!" I shout, "You've had your fun!"

The noise echoes across the concrete of the hallway outside. He chuckles back. What a fucking weirdo.

We'd driven here for midday, I wasn't looking directly at the clock but it must've been before 1pm. The building looked straight out of a horror movie: spire roofs, gothic looking windows, ivy all over the place. There was no reception all the way out here, so if we got in a bind, we'd brought radios. Well, Liam brought them. Maybe he's recording this all on them, so he can play it back later. Make it last longer.

Yes, I've tried using my radio to call for help, but I don't know how to fucking use this thing. There's like 5 different channels, and the only other walkie-talkie here is the one that Liam has. I don't even know if they can connect to anything else - he wouldn't be stupid enough to give me a means of sending an SOS signal, surely not. I've tried talking to him through it but he doesn't respond, and I can't hear it on the other side of the door, so I guess he's muted it. He still randomly taps the side-button, causing my walkie to bleep, and I know it’s just to fuck with me now. 

God, we're out in the sticks. I actually smiled when I saw the lack of any sort of security to this place. There wasn't even a fence or a no trespassing sign. I had to do some pretty deep research to find this place.

Well, maybe not, because I didn't know the doors in this place still fucking lock.

I’ve tried it all. Shoulder into it. Kick low near the hinge. Rattle the handle until my wrist ached. There’s no give to it at all. I mean, duh: it’s reinforced, thick, bulky as all hell. There's a hatch in the middle of the door, where meals were passed through, but that's bolted shut too. There’s a slit of rust around the edge, but no gap wide enough to do anything useful.

The worst part? Liam didn't even have the audacity to answer me back, no matter how many times I begged and screamed and told him it's not funny anymore. All I heard was laughing. Just laughing. A little laugh every time I spoke. He wanted me to hear it, I knew they weren’t real.

I remember walking through the corridor outside whilst he 'scouted ahead' *(fat load of shit that was)* and I turned to 302 because I thought he was in it. Must’ve heard his foot shuffle inside. Well, as I walk in and scan around, there’s a blur in my periphery as a silhouette jumps from the corner closest to the door. I’ve not even spun halfway around when I hear the deafening punch of the door against its frame and a click. 

He got me.

"It's going to get dark soon," I say with my hand pressed against the door, mouth to the smallest little ridge by the food hatch, "and people will start to worry."

I live alone. Nobody else knows I'm here. God, I'm such a fucking idiot.

He cackles back from the corridor whilst still shuffling around. I can't picture what he's doing  but I think he's literally just walking in circles out there. It felt like he could do this all night.

Finally, all of that waiting around in the dark, and all of the comedown from the adrenaline of the situation, got to me. Sat back down against the wall of room 302, I was nodding in and out, when I was jolted completely conscious by the sound of a starting engine.

Oh no. Oh no. Oh fuck, fuck, no.

I scramble to the door and begin slamming on it and screaming out. Some part of me still thought he'd pull the door open. But the bastard's leaving me, with my own fucking car!

"LIAM! LIAM! NO, LIAM!"

I hit, I hit, I hit. The door won't move and the tires are crunching against the gravel outside. I hear my car lurch against the road, brakes screech as Liam struggles with the clutch, and I hear the fading roars of the engine. To say I suddenly felt alone in a building so spooky - no, maybe not, but I felt fucked. Absolutely fucked.

It's silent. I’m a drop in a bucket: a blip amongst thousands of acres of woodland. I’m so alone until I hear the radio crackle to life. I’d forgotten about it at that point, but dropping to my knees and retrieving it from the floor,  Ibegin shouting into it, "YOU ASSHOLE, COME BACK, DON'T LEAVE ME-”

“Amber, shut up, you need to stop talking,” Liam’s voice burst through, thin and panicked through the static. “Listen to me. I didn’t reply because I had the fuckin’ radio muted, I didn’t want him to hear me-”

There were the telltale sounds of an engine through the rasps of the radio’s speaker.

“-look, I think he’s still in there with you,” he said breathlessly, “I don’t know who he is. I saw him in the corridor and I- I’m pretty sure he’s got a gun. I’m going to get help, okay? I’m going to get help and I’m coming back, I swear- just-”

I stared at the radio. And then the door. Clicking the button, I sigh, “Liam, I’m tired of you fucking with-”

“Don’t make a noise, okay? Don’t make a fucking sound,” He shouted back desperately, “I- I tried to wait, tried to get back to you, but he’s on the third floor, just hold tight-”

Liam’s words were drenched by a sound from beyond the door. 

A laugh.

Not through the radio. Not from the far end of the corridor. Right outside.

I leaned towards the radio until my forehead touched it. I didn’t realise that I was crying until my breath hitched.

“Liam?-”

Dead silence.

And then the door unlocked.
