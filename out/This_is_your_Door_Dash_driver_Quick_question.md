   I was FaceTiming Zia, caught between two tops—a sequin number that sparkled like a thousand promises or a polka dot blouse that whispered of comfort. 

   Our upcoming trip to Cocomo - yes I’m Gen Z and yes I love the Beach Boys - was all that mattered at that moment.

"It's not that serious," Zia said, rolling her eyes as she carefully painted her nails a deep crimson. 

  Her hand moved with the precision of an artist, each stroke deliberately making sure to hit perfection for this trip. 

   "Are you kidding me?" I huffed. "The pre-trip outfit sets the entire mood. Everything has to be in order."

“Says the girl who literally hasn’t figured out how to answer her voicemail.”

“Who uses voicemail? Text me!” 

She laughed, that musical laugh that had been our soundtrack since high school. 

"What did you have for dinner?"

I'd been too indecisive to cook, so I'd done what any self-respecting young adult does—opened the DoorDash app.

 "Velvet Tacos coming," I announced, scrolling through my tops. "Speaking of which..."

My phone pinged. 

The driver was en route.

Zia's voice took on a hushed, serious tone. "I don't trust late-night food delivery.”

Here she goes.

“My abuela always said nightfall in Texas holds this… kind of darkness.”

It’s called, night? Stop, Jalissa. 

I was only half-listening—story of our friendship, honestly. Another ping. A text from the driver.

"Hey, this is your Door Dasher - TJ! Quick question?"

Ooh. And the perfect out to grab food and focus on finishing this suitcase.

I told her I call her right back and texted the driver, “Hey I’m here. Whats up?”

What he texted next, sent a small chill down my spine. A chill that prompted me to call him. 

"Hello?" I began, my patience already wearing thin.

"Ms. Jalissa?" The voice was young. Nervous. "This is TJ from DoorDash. I, 
um... I’m about ten minutes away but-"

“You asked me if I was safe? Why?” 

Silence. Then a deep breath. 

“Sir? Do you need call my parents?”

"I saw something. On my way to you."

"Okay..." I dragged the word out. 

"The deliveries out your way normally don’t take this long but look, I needed to share this. Not wanted; needed. 

There’s traffic. Because there was an accident," TJ continued. "A yellow Volkswagen. It hydroplaned, flipped right into the median. I was stuck in traffic, and—" He stopped.

I stood there, eyes darting between laundry and my window. 

"And?" I prompted.

"There was an ambulance. But something was... off." His breathing was ragged now.
“Off?” I said, a bit of anxiety creeping up my spine. 

"Yes. Two stretchers," he said, his voice trembling. "Two people."

"Are they okay?" I asked, more out of social courtesy than genuine concern.

A pause. Then: "No. They were not okay."

I tried to keep my tone light. "Must have been a rough scene. You know I normally don’t hold traffic against anyone for tips you know?”

"No, you don't understand," TJ said. His voice dropped to a whisper. "The people. They weren't on the stretchers. They were standing."

I rolled my eyes. "Okay, sure."

"One was burning. Like, literally on fire. But she wasn't running. Just standing there. The other..." He trailed off.

"The other what?" I pressed.

In a trembled voice he told me one of them was a woman. With low bangs, a septum piercing, freckles. 

Matching my description from my DoorDash photo. 

"She looked exactly like you," TJ blurted out. "I mean, exactly. I checked your profile picture. Same left septum piercing. Same hair. But her throat—" He choked on the words.

A chill ran down my spine. 

"What about her throat?"

"Her throat. Sliced open. Bleeding down this pink rainbow top. And she, too, was just standing. Watching. And when she looked at me..." His voice broke.

"Sir," I said carefully, "what are you talking about?"

"Her eyes. They were ghost white. 
Completely white. Mouth open with blood and teething spilling out." 

He then said she began to walk. Slowly towards the car. 

The burning person next to her began to suddenly thrash violently as if now, just now, they were aware they were on fire. 

And the throatless girl continued to walk, blood spilling on to the pavement as she brokenly scraped her way towards his car, her crooked arms out reached like she was trying to get him to help her while at a when-

HONK!

Suddenly there were horns, numerous horns honking at him. “And then like that, they were gone. The only people on the scene were the cops escorting me to me to now move forward.”

When he continued, his voice was different. Calmer. 

"Anyway, I just wanted to make sure you were okay. I’m… not sure what that was. But that person I saw… er- anyway. I’m turning on Beckhurst. Two blocks over.” 

I tried to laugh it off. "Sounds like you've had a long day."

"Yeah," he said. "A long day."

“And if it’s any consolation I don’t know anyone with that car and I don't have any rainbow top.”

This got a laugh out of him. TJ seemed a lot chiller now. 

After we hung up, I tried to shake off the conversation. Just a stressed-out delivery driver, I told myself. Nothing more.

My phone pinged. 

DoorDash notification.

Food delivered. And like that TJ was gone. 

Trust me. I watched for two minutes out of my bedroom to make sure. 

I called Zia back, eager to share the weird encounter, but got sent to voicemail. 

I decided to take the time before dinner and finish packing to take a quick shower.
It was definitely needed after that little fiasco. 

Thankfully I had already forgot what he was even going on about.

Like really, what was that about? It was like a fear or panic but then it was gone. My chat history didn’t have… I already forgot his name. 

Hope that kid turns out okay.

As I was in the shower Zia called back, and instead of just texting me like she usually does she decided to leave a voicemail to be funny.

 One of these days I’ll figure out how to listen to them but I’ll text her on the way tomorrow.

VOICEMAIL 
from ZIAGIRLYY💜😛

“Hey you, sorry I missed your call.

 I was getting the rental set up in my dad’s name. I wanted an SUV but he got us a Volvo! 

I’m not sure but it’s like really bright and gross. 

By the way, I know you can’t listen to these so you won’t be able to guess who got you the perfect top from your favorite group for the trip? 

That’s right I found Pink Floyd on sale! I was gonna tell you on the phone to give to you tonight but I’ll surprise you on the way. You won’t see this coming 🙃

Talk to you tomorrow!

Ah I’m so excited I could die! 

Love ya!”
