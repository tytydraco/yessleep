I didn’t find the tiny man in a dramatic way. I wasn’t digging through an attic or opening some cursed box. I was late for work and trying to see if I had enough change for coffee.

The jacket was old. One I hadn’t worn since winter. It was hanging off the back of my desk chair, half inside-out, like it had given up on being useful, just another piece of clutter in my room. I shoved my hand into the pocket without looking.

Something grabbed onto my finger.

I yanked my hand out so fast I slammed my knuckles into the bottom of the desk. I let out a scream, well, more like an involuntary bark. My heart was already racing before I even looked down at whatever was in my hand.

There was a man standing in my palm.

Four inches tall. Maybe a little more. He wore a tiny pinstripe suit, dark gray, tailored like it had been made for him specifically. Little polished shoes. A tie. He stood upright, perfectly balanced, like this wasn’t the strangest possible place for him to be.

He looked up at me and smiled.

“Oh,” he said. “There you are.”

I threw my hands up in shock when he spoke.

He didn’t fall. He just landed on the desk on his feet, adjusted his cuffs, and looked mildly annoyed.

I backed up so fast I tripped and fell backward onto my bed. My brain cycled through explanations faster than it could discard them. Toy. Hallucination. Stroke. What in the fuck was I looking at?

The tiny man cleared his throat.

“I was beginning to think you’d stopped wearing that jacket,” he said. “Which would’ve been unfortunate.”

I stared at him. I checked my hands. I checked the room. I checked the desk again, like maybe if I looked away long enough he’d resolve into something explainable.

From the other room, my roommate Max laughed at something. The world, apparently, was continuing on just fine.

“Okay,” I said. My voice cracked immediately. I swallowed and tried again. “Okay. No. This isn’t happening.”

The tiny man tilted his head. “It is.”

“What are you?” I asked.

He straightened slightly, like he’d been waiting for that.

“My name is Mr. Answer.”

I waited. Nothing else came.

“That’s it?” I said.

“Yes.”

I ran a hand through my hair and laughed once, sharp and breathless. “So you’re a what, like a fairy? A demon?”

Mr. Answer frowned faintly. “None of those would be very efficient.”

I didn’t like that word. Efficient.

He glanced toward the door, then back at me. “You’re running late.”

I was even more taken aback.

“I don’t, how do you—”

“You should stop at the ATM on your way out,” he said. “Not the one on the corner. The one two blocks down, across from the pharmacy.”

I stared at him.

“Why?” I asked.

He smiled again. Calm. Professional. Like this was the most reasonable suggestion in the world.

“You’ll see.”

From the other room, Max called out, “Dude, you need a ride or what?”

I looked at Mr. Answer. At his tiny pinstripe suit. At the way he stood there like he’d always belonged on my desk.

Then I did something I still don’t know how to explain.

I picked him up, and put him in my pocket.

He weighed almost nothing, probably just a little less than my phone.

“Yeah,” I called back, shakily. “I’m coming.”

Mr. Answer shifted slightly in my pants, settling in.

“Good,” he said. “It’s more efficient if I’m with you.”

He paused.

“But it’s better if you don’t involve anyone else. Explanations are inefficient.”

Mr. Answer didn’t say anything else after that.

He just settled in my pocket, like he’d decided where he belonged. I stood there for another second, staring at the door with my heart still racing, before grabbing my bag and heading out.

Max drove. He always did. Working at the same place and living together meant that it didn’t take much convincing for him to become my personal chauffeur.

His car was already running when I got in, music low, one hand resting on the wheel.

“You good?” Max asked, glancing over. “You look like you just saw a ghost.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Just tired.”

Mr. Answer shifted in my pocket as the car pulled away. Not enough to be obvious. Just enough that I knew he was there.

“Hey,” I said, before I could talk myself out of it. “Can we stop somewhere real quick?”

Max sighed, but it wasn’t annoyed. “We’re already pushing it.”

“I know. I just… I have to check something out,” I said, avoiding eye contact. “Just at the ATM on the next block.”

He glanced over again, eyebrows raised.

“Now what could you possibly have to check out at an ATM?”

I didn’t answer right away. My mouth felt dry. There was absolutely no version of this conversation that didn’t end with me sounding insane.

“Okay, fine,” I said, sliding my hand into my pocket. “You’re not gonna believe this…”

Something sharp sank into my finger.

I yelped and ripped my hand back instinctively. Pain flared hot and sudden. I caught a glimpse of Mr. Answer’s tiny polished shoe as he kicked off my knuckle and disappeared deeper into the pocket.

“Jesus, Danny,” Max said. “What the hell was that?”

I stared at my hand. A tiny bead of blood had already formed on my index finger.

“I—” I laughed, breathless and awkward. “Never mind. It’s nothing.”

Max squinted at me. “Okay, well you’re acting weird.”

“It’s all good,” I said, sharper than I meant to. “Just drop it.”

Max frowned, then shrugged.

Before I realized it, he had already pulled to the curb in front of an ATM.

“Alright, weirdo,” he said. “If this is a robbery, I’m not involved.”

I didn’t know there was an ATM there. But there it was, exactly where Mr. Answer had said it would be.

I got out of the car and started making my way over to it.

“Did you just fucking bite me?” I whispered to my pocket.

“It’s better if you don’t involve anyone else,” Mr. Answer said again.

“You know I can crush you, right?”

“That would be sub-optimal for both me and you.”

“Oh, and how’s tha—”

I stopped in my tracks.

Sitting in the open tray was money. A lot of it. At least twenty hundred-dollar bills, stacked and waiting like they’d been left there on purpose.

I stood there longer than I should have, staring at it, waiting for something to happen. An alarm. A shout. Someone tapping me on the shoulder.

Nothing did.

I took the money and walked back to the car.

Max’s eyebrows shot up when he saw it. “No way.”

“I know,” I said. “Just had a hunch, I guess.”

“That’s not a hunch,” he said. “That’s fucking crazy.” He perked up, shifting in his seat as he looked at the stack of cash. “Okay, never mind. I *am* involved in this robbery.”

I laughed, then choked. My chest felt tight, like I couldn’t quite pull a full breath in.

“No, but seriously,” Max said. “Whose money is that?”

I glanced down at the cash. “Mine, I guess,” I said with a weak chuckle, handing him a hundred.

Max took it with a grin. “Well then,” he said, tucking it away, “consider my silence officially bought,” before turning his attention back to the road.

We pulled back into traffic like nothing had happened.

I slipped the money into my pocket. When I extended my fingers, they cracked loudly.

That was the first of Mr. Answer’s suggestions. I wouldn’t doubt him again.

**\*\*\***

I didn’t think about Mr. Answer at work.

Not consciously, anyway.

I clocked in, set my bag under my desk, logged on. Same routine. Same fluorescent hum. Someone nearby was already on a call, talking louder than necessary, confident in a way that always made my shoulders tense.

My calendar reminder popped up.

*Department Sync — 9:30 AM*

Ten minutes.

Normally, that meant ten minutes of rehearsing sentences I’d never say. Thinking of ideas that felt stupid the second they formed. Telling myself I’d speak up this time, knowing I wouldn’t.

I felt that familiar pressure start to build in my chest.

The meeting room filled up. Chairs scraped. Laptops opened. Someone joked about how long it was going to be. I took my usual seat near the end of the table and folded my hands together to keep them still.

People started talking. Problems were laid out. The same ones we’d been circling for weeks.

I kept my head down.

Then, without warning—

“Wait,” Mr. Answer said.

I stiffened.

The word was quiet, but it cut straight through my thoughts.

No one reacted. No one even glanced at me. The conversation kept flowing like nothing had happened.

My heart hammered.

*Did I imagine that?*

Someone suggested a workaround that made my stomach sink. I opened my mouth, then closed it again, scared to sound stupid.

“That won’t help,” Mr. Answer said calmly. “It treats the symptom, not the disease.”

I swallowed.

My pulse thudded in my ears. I stared at my notes, at my hands, at anything but the faces around the table.

“Say something,” he continued. “Now.”

I didn’t decide to speak.

I just did.

“Actually,” I heard myself say, and the room quieted, “I think we’re fixing the wrong part of the problem.”

Every head turned.

The sentence landed clean. Too clean.

“Slow down,” Mr. Answer murmured.

So I did.

I spoke again, more carefully this time, the words coming out fully formed, like they’d been waiting their turn. I felt detached from them, like I was listening to someone else talk through my mouth.

“Don’t qualify it,” he said.

My instinct screamed at me to soften it, to apologize, to add a disclaimer.

I didn’t.

“We keep patching the output,” I said. “But the bottleneck’s earlier. If we move the checkpoint upstream, we don’t need half of these fixes.”

Silence.

Then my manager leaned back in her chair.

“That’s… actually a really good point,” she said. “Why haven’t we tried that?”

Someone else nodded. “Yeah. That would save a ton of time.”

The meeting moved on like I’d flipped a switch.

When it ended, people lingered.

“Nice catch.”

“Didn’t expect that.”

“Good call.”

I smiled. I nodded. I shook hands.

The moment I sat back down at my desk, my jaw cracked sharply when I relaxed it. The sound made the guy next to me flinch.

“You alright?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said quickly, rubbing my face. “Just tense.”

I turned to grab my water bottle and my neck popped, loud and sudden, like something snapping back into place too fast. A dull ache spread and faded before I could react.

My chest felt tight, smaller, like my lungs were working with less room than usual.

“That was effective,” Mr. Answer said.

The word felt clinical.

I stared at my screen, suddenly aware that I couldn’t remember exactly what I’d said. None of the wording or the structure. Just the sensation of speaking at the exact right moment.

Later that afternoon, I ran into Max by the elevators.

“Heard you crushed it today,” he said casually. “Someone from your department was talking you up.”

“Oh,” I said. “Yeah. Guess so.”

He nodded, already half-distracted.

The elevator doors slid shut. The numbers ticked down.

I stood there with my hands in my pockets, my pulse finally slowing.

It didn’t feel like confidence.

It felt like something had spoken through me.

And I couldn’t stop thinking about how easy it had been to let it happen.

**\*\*\***

I met Matilda on a Thursday night.

It had been three days since I’d found Mr. Answer. In that moment, I never thought I’d choose to have him around, but over those first three days he had made me into a new man. He had made me talented. He had made me smart. He had made me confident.

So when I was getting ready to go out to some bar Max was dragging me to, I slipped Mr. Answer into my pocket without much hesitation. He never asked to come with me, but always accepted it with quiet indifference.

We ended up at a bar close to the office. Loud enough that you couldn’t hear yourself think. Bright enough that you couldn’t hide.

I stood near the edge of the room with a drink I didn’t really want, nodding along to a conversation I wasn’t part of. My chest still felt strange, tight, like my body was having trouble holding something in.

That’s when I noticed her.

She was leaning against the bar, laughing at something someone said, her body angled away like she already wanted out. When she caught me looking, she smiled, quick and polite, then looked back down at her drink.

I told myself not to go over there.

Mr. Answer told me otherwise.

I took the leap.

“Hey,” I said, immediately regretting it. “Sorry. I just—sorry.”

She laughed. Not unkindly. “You okay?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I’m just bad at this.”

“That makes two of us,” she said, turning fully toward me. “I’m Matilda.”

We talked. Or tried to. It was clumsy. Starts and stops. Long pauses where I felt my pulse in my ears and tried not to fill the silence with apologies.

I was about to bail. I could feel the exit forming in my head, the excuse lining itself up.

Then Mr. Answer spoke.

“Pause,” he said quietly.

I did.

“Ask her about the book she mentioned.”

I frowned slightly. She’d said something about a book earlier. I hadn’t even realized I’d clocked it.

“What was the book you were talking about?” I asked.

Her eyes lit up. She leaned in, animated now, words spilling out easily. I nodded in the right places. I didn’t interrupt.

“Don’t rush it,” Mr. Answer said. “Let her finish.”

When I spoke again, he gave me the words. Nudges. Phrases. Timing.

It felt good.

My fingers went numb around my glass. When I shifted my grip, my wrist cracked sharply, sending a flash of pain up my arm. I laughed to cover it, then felt my jaw tighten and pop when I smiled too wide.

“You alright?” Matilda asked.

“Yeah,” I said, my breath coming a little short. “Sorry.”

She studied me for a second, more curious than suspicious.

“You’re very confident,” she said finally. “In a strange way.”

I didn’t know how to respond to that.

We talked for another half hour. When she checked her phone and sighed, my stomach dropped.

“I should go,” she said. “Early morning.”

“Right,” I said. “Yeah. Of course.”

She hesitated, then held out her phone. “You want my number?”

I programmed my number into her phone maybe a little too fast.

“You better call me,” Mr. Answer said from my pocket.

“You better call me,” I echoed to Matilda.

It made her smile.

When she walked away, the noise of the bar rushed back in all at once. My chest felt tight again, smaller than it should’ve been.

Mr. Answer was quiet.

That bothered me more than it should have.

I realized, standing there, that I wanted him to speak again. That I needed him to speak again.

**\*\*\***

A few weeks passed.

I never actually started asking Mr. Answer for help. 

I just stopped noticing when I was following it.

By the end of the month, listening to my pocket had become part of my routine. The same way you check your phone before leaving the house. Keys. Wallet. Mr. Answer.

I caught myself choosing clothes based on how easily he fit. Jackets with deeper pockets. Pants that didn’t press too tight when I sat. My clothes were fitting looser than normal anyway. I told myself it was practical. 

“Leave earlier,” Mr. Answer said one morning.

I did.

I missed a traffic jam by minutes. Found a parking spot without circling. Got to my desk before anyone else. The day slid into place like it was supposed to.

At work, his suggestions came constantly. Quiet. Efficient.

“Wait.”

“Now.”

“Don’t respond to that.”

I listened without thinking about it. Conversations flowed better. Meetings ended faster. People started looking to me before making decisions.

“You always know what to say,” someone told me.

I smiled, like that was something I’d earned.

Matilda texted me first more often than not. Short things. Check-ins. Plans made without the back-and-forth I used to dread. Mr. Answer helped there too. Timing. Phrasing. When to let a message sit unanswered just long enough.

My fingers went numb more often. It usually passed if I shook them out. My joints cracked when I stood, when I sat, when I turned too quickly. I noticed it, but only in the same way you notice a stiff neck or a sore knee. Annoying but manageable.

I stopped stretching because it made the popping worse. Stopped taking deep breaths because my chest felt tight when I did. I adjusted without really thinking about it.

One afternoon, Mr. Answer went quiet.

I was halfway through a conversation when I realized he hadn’t said anything in a while. My words slowed. I felt exposed, like I’d stepped into traffic without checking.

I finished the thought anyway.

It went fine.

But my heart didn’t slow down until Mr. Answer spoke again.

“That was acceptable,” he said.

Relief washed through me so fast it made me dizzy.

That night, Matilda watched me for a moment longer than usual.

“You okay?” she asked. “You seem distracted lately.”

“I’m good,” I said automatically.

She nodded, but didn’t look convinced.

Later, lying in bed, I became aware of how still I was holding myself. How shallow my breathing had gotten. When I shifted, something in my spine clicked softly, like parts settling into place.

I realized then that I couldn’t remember the last decision I’d made without Mr. Answer’s input.

That thought should have scared me.

Instead, all I felt was relief.

Like I’d finally stopped doing things the hard way.

**\*\*\***

A month passed.

In that month, I got promoted. Not a massive leap, but enough that people started stopping by my desk instead of the other way around. My manager trusted me with decisions. My calendar filled up in a way that felt intentional instead of overwhelming.

Matilda stayed over more nights than she didn’t. She left a toothbrush in my bathroom without asking. We talked about weekends in advance. Normal things. Real things.

I told myself I’d built something solid.

But I couldn’t stop noticing my body.

My clothes hung looser than they used to. Not dramatically, but enough that I kept adjusting them. My sleeves slid past my wrists if I wasn’t paying attention. My shoes felt strange, like my feet didn’t quite sit in them the way they used to.

Every movement came with noise now. Pops and cracks when I stood up. When I sat down. When I turned too quickly. Sometimes it felt like things inside me shifted before I finished moving, like my body was a half-second behind itself.

“You’ve lost weight,” Matilda said one night, her hand resting on my arm. “Are you eating?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Just stress, I guess.”

She frowned. “You’re cold.”

I just laughed it off and wrapped my arms around her.

That night, lying awake beside her, I made the decision.

I didn’t need Mr. Answer anymore.

He’d helped me get here. I could admit that. But this felt different now. Stable. Earned. I didn’t want to rely on anything else. I didn’t want to explain him. I didn’t want to need him.

The next morning, I left him in the closet.

Mr. Answer didn’t say anything.

That made it easier.

The first few days were uncomfortable, but manageable. Conversations felt slower. I hesitated more. I caught myself reaching for my pocket and stopping halfway through the motion.

Nothing went wrong.

That felt important.

But my body didn’t adjust the way I expected it to.

The popping got worse. Deeper. Sharper. Sometimes I felt a scraping sensation when I moved, like things inside me were rubbing where they shouldn’t. My chest ached constantly now, a dull pressure that made it hard to forget about my breathing.

That night, I tried to stretch before bed. As I reached overhead, something in my spine shifted with a wet, grinding pop that stole the air from my lungs. I collapsed onto the mattress, gasping, heart racing.

I stood in the bedroom doorway afterward, staring at the closet.

I didn’t open it.

I told myself this was what adjustment felt like. That my body was catching up. That I was doing the right thing.

I told myself I didn’t need Mr. Answer anymore.

But deep down, I really didn’t believe it.

**\*\*\***

The first meeting without Mr. Answer went badly.

Not catastrophically, just a few moments where I spoke and felt the room hesitate instead of lean in.

I finished a sentence and realized I’d said it too late. Someone else had already moved the conversation forward. When I tried again, my words felt heavy, like I was pushing them uphill.

“That’s not what you said last week,” someone said, not unkindly.

“I just meant—” I started, then stopped. The thought had already slipped away from me.

My manager frowned. Confused.

“Let’s circle back later,” she said.

We didn’t.

After that, people stopped coming by my desk. Decisions that used to route through me quietly went elsewhere. When I spoke up, someone double-checked. When I hesitated, they moved on without waiting.

I told myself it was temporary.

Max mentioned it offhandedly one night.

“People are asking what changed,” he said, scrolling on his phone. “You were kind of the golden boy there for a minute.”

I shrugged. “Guess the novelty wore off.”

He glanced at me. “You okay, man?”

“Yeah,” I said automatically.

My body disagreed.

My hands shook when I held a coffee mug. My fingers cracked audibly when I gestured, the sound sharp enough that people looked at me whenever I moved.

When I shifted in my chair, I felt something scrape inside me. Like bone against bone. Like parts of me weren’t aligned the way they used to be.

Matilda noticed.

“Are you sick?” she asked one night, sitting cross-legged on my bed. “You look and sound like a bag of bones.”

“I’m just tired,” I said. “And stressed.”

“Is that why you’re always zoning out?” she added. “It’s like you’re waiting for something every time I talk to you.”

I didn’t know how to answer that.

She reached for my hand and frowned. “You feel… smaller, Danny.”

I laughed, too loud. “That’s not how bodies work.”

She didn’t laugh back.

That was the last time I saw her.

Work reassigned a project I’d been leading. A calendar invite disappeared. Someone else took over the meeting. No explanation was given.

I stopped sleeping well. My appetite faded. My clothes hung even looser now. When I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror, something about my proportions looked off, but I couldn’t pin down why.

I blamed stress. I blamed myself.

One afternoon, standing up too quickly, my neck cracked in a series of sharp pops that left me dizzy and breathless. I had to sit back down, heart pounding, sweat prickling along my scalp.

That was when it hit me.

Nothing had actually gone wrong when I stopped listening to him.

Things had just stopped working.

My timing. My instincts. My confidence. My body.

It hadn’t been a crutch.

It had been a system.

That night, I stood in front of my closet for a long time.

I rested my hand against the door and tried to remember what my life had felt like before any of this.

I couldn’t.

I didn’t want help.

I wanted my life back.

And I knew exactly who to ask.

**\*\*\***

I opened my closet and pulled out the sock drawer at the top of my dresser.

Mr. Answer sat inside it, cross-legged, immaculate as ever. His pinstripe suit looked freshly pressed. Around him were crumbs. I hadn’t remembered giving him food.

“Please,” I begged. “Fix this.”

He looked up at me.

“Hello to you too,” he said.

I clenched my jaw. It popped.

“I don’t need your niceties, I need you to fix this.”

He studied me the way a technician studies a failed component.

“Fix what?” He responded, finally.

“My life,” I said. “Fix my life. Fix me. I can’t… I can’t do it. I can’t do any of it without you.”

He blinked slowly.

“That’s not possible, Danny,” he said, like he was explaining a policy. “Two weeks without me and we are back to baseline. Very inefficient.”

“So that’s it?” I said. “You just let me fall apart?”

He smiled faintly.

“What I can do,” he said, “is finish what we started.”

Something in my chest loosened and tightened at the same time.

“I didn’t start anything,” I said.

“You did,” Mr. Answer replied. “Every time you chose to accept my answers, I never forced you to listen, to bring me everywhere you went, that was you.”

My hands were shaking now, from exhaustion more than anger.

“Tell me what to do,” I said.

Mr. Answer nodded, stood up, and leaned on the edge of the drawer.

“Sit on the floor,” he said. “Close your eyes.”

I did it immediately.

“Repeat after me,” he said.

The floor felt cold against my legs. I was closer to it than I used to be.

“I want the answer,” Mr. Answer said.

“I want the answer,” I repeated.

Something gave inside me.

A crack and then a pull.

Like wet cartilage being drawn inward. Like my rib cage tightening one notch too far. My lungs stuttered, breath catching halfway in, and I gagged on the air that wasn’t there.

“I want the answer,” Mr. Answer said.

“I want the answer,” I said, and my femurs screamed. A grinding compression that made my thighs tremble as bone slid against bone with a thick, nauseating scrape.

My stomach folded in on itself. I tasted bile.

I tried to open my eyes.

“Don’t.” Mr. Answer said.

I squeezed them shut.

“I want the answer.”

My spine began to collapse inward, vertebrae slipping over each other with a series of slick, muffled pops, like fingers pressed into raw meat. My back arched violently, muscles seizing as the column shortened, the sensation radiating outward into my ribs, my shoulders, my neck.

Something inside my chest shifted.

My heart stuttered, then resumed in a new place.

I screamed, but it came out wrong: thinner, higher, strangled by a throat that was suddenly too narrow for it.

“I want the answer,” Mr. Answer said calmly.

“I want the answer,” I sobbed, and my arms pulled inward, bones retracting with a sickening tug that made my joints scream as ligaments recoiled like snapped rubber bands. My hands spasmed, fingers curling, nails scraping against the floor as my reach disappeared inch by inch.

My organs felt crowded. Packed too tightly. Like they were being folded and stacked instead of held.

Something warm slid down my legs. I didn’t know if it was sweat, piss, or blood. I didn’t care.

“I want the answer.”

My skull compressed. Crushing then reshaping.

A deep pressure bloomed behind my eyes as my jaw slid backward with a thick, gummy crunch. My teeth clicked together violently, then loosened, then settled in a configuration that felt wrong in my mouth.

The sound of my own breathing became thin and fast, like air being forced through a smaller instrument.

Then, abruptly—

Stillness.

No pressure. No grinding. No pain.

My body felt aligned.

Light.

Quiet.

“You may open your eyes,” Mr. Answer said.

I did.

My clothes lay around me like shed skin.

The floor felt enormous.

Mr. Answer stood far above me, looking down from the dresser drawer as if it were the roof of a skyscraper.

I looked down at myself and understood everything at once.

“What did you do?” I whispered.

“You wanted the answer,” he said. “Smaller systems are easier to optimize. You’ll hear more now.”

He climbed onto the lip of the drawer and stood at the edge, toes hanging over a freefall.

“It’s so quiet now,” he said, a look of elation crossing his face. “Thank you.”

Then Mr. Answer leaned forward and fell.

He plummeted toward the hardwood floor headfirst.

“Wait—” I called out, uselessly.

His head struck the floor with a dull thud, his neck cracking like a toothpick before the rest of his body crumpled on top of itself.

Mr. Answer was gone.

But the silence afterward was brief.

The air filled with noise.

High-pitched, directionless information vibrating through space itself. Answers embedded in pressure, in motion, in the way particles brush past one another.

I don't know where Mr. Answer came from, or who he used to be.

But now I can hear outcomes.

I can hear what will happen.

I can hear answers.

Writing this has felt like a marathon, jumping on my laptop keys like some fucked-up version of DDR. Don't even get me started on how hard it was to get onto my desk. 

But now that my story is told, I suppose all I can do is sit down, in a tiny, stolen, pinstripe suit, and wait.

Wait and see if Max wants to hear the answers I have for him.
