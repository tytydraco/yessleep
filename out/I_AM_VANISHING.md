  Hello i want to tell you about the things that are happening the last few months

It all started 10 days before it was just a normal day in my life i was going to work .When i arrived everything seemed normal but my boss disappeared. When i asked my colleagues they said thet they didn't knew him.

Then i went to my favourite cafe, i asked for the tea i drink and they said that they didn't sell that flavour.

Just before i went to bed i went to my bathroom and saw the tooth brush holder it was empty. But that day i saw when i woke up it was there.( I live alone)

Then I went to bed my pillow was missing and i slept without one 

The next day i texted my mom her number wasn't there when. Then I went to my mum's house and when i rang the bell an elderly couple answered i didn't knew the i asked them where my mum was they told me that they didn't knew her.

Then I went to my home it was empty the only thing that was there was a painting it said gnihsinav . I was wondering where everything went i sat at a corner where my beautiful armchair.

I sat there crying and wondering what did the message said why is everything happening to me am i vanishing why everything i know and loved is vanishing. 

 Then i wrote the message at the wall to a piece of paper i flipped it and it said vanishing i screamed . That has to do something with my  problem.

Then i went to the playground that i used to play when i was a kid it wasn't there.It was just a void i asked somebody if he was seeing the void he said that i am crazy and there was a playground.

Then someone hit me and i passed out 
3rd day


I went to work guess what it wasn't there but the worst thing happened i saw a friend and said hello he said "Do I even know you" . It was there when i realised that I am vanishing the things that I see are not vanishing i am.

I  opened my phone and it said ouy era.I turned my phone up side down it said you are ... VANISHING. Then i saw something a shadow i couldn't make out what that was but i ignored it.

4th day

I woke up in to the middle of the street i opened my phone i was nowhere i looked myself at the screen of my phone , i didn't have a reflection. Then i went to the pictures app and at every picture i had i was nowhere.
 
Then i took my wallet out i my ID was blank. Then i saw something a shadow i followed it. It was at a house then i passed out again.

5th day

I woke into the house i saw the last day it was an old rotten house with big tinted from time in a yellow colour. It had a weird smell to it then i saw the shadow.

It talked it said the worst things that I have ever heard.It said that i was vanishing it didn't knew why or how to stop it. It told me that the same thing happened to it 

It said also that somehow it escaped to my reality because it found a rift from realities it said that it didn't have a lot time and it should help me found what is happening.

I asked it why was i passing out and it said that also my fiscal body is vanishing and probably my brain was to.

Then i went to the forest i looked at my arm it had vanished and its place was a black void darker than the darkest place more dark than a black hole darker than the dark sky at night.

6th day
 
I have lost both of my arms now but have i . Actually no this new void arms are like normal but weaker but i was warned by the shadow that if i become a void as a whole i would go to the "void" that is a white desert that you would wonder forever alone. Nothing bad happened that day.

7th day

Oh no something bad is happening i am happy that i write this post at Reddit in case i vanish nobody else does. Anyway i just realized nobody that i know has vanished from my point of my reality even the shadow.

Also more places are vanishing really fast the only thing i have known it's my phone and legs.I am wondering almost a white desert know except of when i see an occasional building.

8th day

9th day
