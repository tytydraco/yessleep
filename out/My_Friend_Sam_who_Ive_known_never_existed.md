I am an AI engineer who has been working from home for years, ever since my divorce. My life has been a constant routine: work from home, go grocery shopping, and take care of day-to-day tasks. My marriage didn’t go well, lasting only two years. She wanted a divorce, and time has passed—it’s nearly a year since our divorce. I live alone in a countryside house and manage everything on my own.

One evening, while I was working, I received a call from an unknown number.

“Hey, I’m Sam. Are you home tomorrow? I could use a place to crash. I’ve got some stuff to do, and it would be great to spend the night with you.”

Sam was one of my college friends—one of my best friends, as I remember. He hadn’t called me in years. It had been almost four years since I last heard from him, and now he was planning to visit tomorrow. It felt like a change was finally coming to my life. After everything—my stressful divorce and job struggles—this felt like a welcome distraction. My mind wandered back to my college days, the happiest time of my life. Sam, Jake, Murphy, and I—we were a small gang, always up to mischief. I remember the freedom we had, the lack of responsibility, and the constant fun. We did everything together: we threw water balloons at our class teacher, got back at our childhood bullies, and everything seemed like a fun game. Those days were unforgettable.

Sam was funny and smart, always making us laugh, but when the situation called for it, he stepped up and acted like the leader of our group. He wasn’t always the leader, though—Jake was serious, but he had his moments too. Murphy was the troublemaker, always starting fights or creating chaos, but he had the kindest heart of us all. Murphy lived in the next town over, and while we didn’t see each other often, at least once every three months, we’d catch up. Jake was busy, and we’d only talk once a year. But Sam… Sam was harder to reach. After college, he dropped off the radar. It had been more than ten years since we graduated, and Sam had only contacted me 23 times in all that time. Life had gotten in the way, and we all had our own troubles to deal with.

Sam was coming tomorrow, so I had to be ready. I wanted to make a nice dinner for him, and I’d bought some whiskey and wine—whatever he preferred. It had been so long since we hung out, and I wanted everything to be perfect.

As the evening wore on, I waited for him. I had expected him to arrive in the evening, but it was getting late. I couldn’t help but feel a bit anxious. Finally, I heard a knock at the door. After all this time, someone was at my door. I opened it slowly, my heart racing a little. There he was—Sam.

He stepped in, and I invited him to sit on the sofa. As he settled in, I couldn’t help but notice how much he had changed. His smile—once the kind that could brighten any room—was still there, but something about it felt… off. Sam had always been the life of the party, the guy who made everything fun, but now, sitting across from me, he seemed tired, worn down. His presence brought a sense of unease. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but there was something different about him.

“You’ve really got the place to yourself, huh?” Sam said, his voice soft, as if he were testing the waters to see if everything was okay.

I nodded. “Yeah, it’s just me and the quiet now.”

He looked around, his gaze lingering a bit too long on the walls and the furniture. It felt like he was scanning everything. “You look good,” he added. “This place suits you.”

I tried to smile. “It’s just me here… managing.”

I gestured to the bottles I’d bought earlier. “Got some whiskey and wine, if you’re in the mood.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “A little too fancy for a quiet night in, don’t you think?” His smile was easy, but his eyes seemed to be studying me more closely than I was comfortable with.

The conversation was stilted. We talked about our lives—work, the divorce, all the things that were part of my daily routine now. Sam gave vague answers when it came to his life, as though he were hiding something, or maybe he just didn’t want to share. It didn’t feel like the reunion I had imagined. Instead of jokes, laughter, and old stories, the night seemed full of empty spaces, filled only by the sound of the ticking clock on the wall.

The more we talked, the more I began to feel like I wasn’t sitting with the same person I once knew. The Sam I remembered had been full of energy, full of life, but now, sitting across from me, he seemed distant. A stranger in a familiar body.

We spent a few more hours talking, but the conversation never quite hit the rhythm I expected. Sam was distant, as if he were thinking about something else, even though he tried to seem engaged. His usual wit, the sharp comebacks, the easygoing vibe that always made him the center of attention—none of that was here tonight. Instead, I caught him staring off into the distance now and then, his eyes clouded with something I couldn’t place.

Finally, around midnight, Sam excused himself. “I’m exhausted,” he said, his voice quieter than usual. “I’m going to hit the sack.”

I showed him to the guest room. He thanked me, said goodnight, and closed the door behind him with a soft click.

I tried to settle down, but sleep eluded me. The house was too quiet. I kept thinking about Sam—what had changed? Why did he feel… off? But before I could dwell on it too much, exhaustion started to creep in. I finally drifted off, though something lingered in the back of my mind, making the sleep restless.

I woke up suddenly, my eyes snapping open. It was just past 2 a.m. I glanced at the clock on the nightstand. Silence. But it was a strange kind of silence. The kind that felt heavy, like the air had thickened.

That’s when I heard it.

A faint rustling. It wasn’t loud, but it was distinct—almost like something scraping against the floor. At first, I thought it was Sam. Maybe he had trouble sleeping too. But then I remembered—I hadn’t heard a sound from his room all night. The guest room door was shut, and the only noise that had come from there was the soft shuffle of footsteps as he settled in.

I lay there, trying to ignore the noise, but it persisted. It was coming from the hallway. I could hear it distinctly now—footsteps. Slow, deliberate steps that seemed to circle the upstairs corridor, never quite passing by my room. Whoever it was, it didn’t sound like Sam. The pace wasn’t his. He would never walk like that.

I strained my ears, listening. The sound stopped for a few seconds, and I hoped it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. But then it came again—this time, closer, like someone was pacing just outside my door. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I held my breath, trying to figure out if it was Sam coming to talk or… something else.

But it was too quiet now.

I dared not get up. I told myself it was nothing. Maybe it was just the house settling—those old, creaky wooden floors. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks, tired from the conversation with Sam.

I lay there, trying to reassure myself. But the sound… it continued, erratically, like someone was walking around in circles. It didn’t sound like footsteps anymore—it was more like something dragging against the floor.

And it wasn’t coming from Sam’s room.

The footsteps, the dragging noises—whatever it was—had finally stopped. I don’t know how long I lay there, heart racing, staring at the ceiling. My mind was spinning in circles. Was it Sam moving around, or something else? The feeling of unease had settled deep within me, gnawing at my insides.

But then, as if the night was simply playing tricks on me, the sounds ceased. The house was still again. The silence was deafening. I closed my eyes, trying to find sleep once more. But it was impossible. My thoughts swirled, consumed by doubt and confusion. Was I just imagining things? Or was something truly… off?

I must’ve drifted off at some point, because when I finally opened my eyes again, it was 5:40 a.m. My body felt heavy from lack of rest, and the first thing I noticed was the thin light creeping in through the window—the soft, pale glow of dawn.

Suddenly, there was a knock at my door.

I jumped, startled out of the remnants of sleep. Who could it be? Sam? But why would he knock at this hour? I quickly rubbed my eyes, still groggy, and made my way to the door.

When I opened it, there stood Sam.

He looked… different. He had his usual half-smile, but his eyes were vacant, unfocused, as though they didn’t quite align with the person standing in front of me. He was dressed in the same clothes he had worn the day before, his coat still unbuttoned, a bit askew, as if he had just thrown it on in a hurry.

“Hey, man,” he greeted me, his voice oddly flat. “Sorry to wake you so early. I gotta go catch a train. Wasn’t planning on leaving this early, but things changed. You know how it is.”

I stood there, frozen, still trying to process what was going on. The strange noises from last night, Sam’s weird demeanor, and now this—him leaving so suddenly, with no explanation?

I blinked, a feeling of confusion swirling in my mind. “You’re leaving already?” I asked, my voice sounding a bit more skeptical than I intended. “You didn’t mention anything about leaving so early.”

Sam just shrugged, that same unsettling smile plastered on his face. “Yeah, things came up. I really gotta go. Don’t worry about it. I’ll catch you later, okay?”

I felt an odd chill run through me as he turned to leave, as though I should’ve said something more, but the words wouldn’t come. Before I could gather my thoughts, he was already halfway down the stairs, walking briskly, not looking back.

The door clicked shut behind him, and I was left standing in the hallway, still half-asleep, with a dozen questions swirling in my mind. I glanced out the window, watching Sam’s figure fade into the early morning mist as he made his way toward the train station.

I couldn’t shake the nagging feeling that something wasn’t right. It was too sudden. Too… strange. Something had shifted overnight.

What was going on with Sam?

And why was he acting so differently?

I made my way back to the couch, still puzzled by the interaction. The noises from the night before suddenly came rushing back to me, and I couldn’t ignore the gnawing suspicion. Was he hiding something? Was he lying to me about something?

The whole situation felt wrong. And the more I tried to push it from my mind, the more it consumed me. There had to be a reason for the weird noises. There had to be a reason for the strange behavior.

But for now, all I had were questions and an empty house.

It had been a few days since Sam left, and every time I tried calling him, I was met with nothing but dead silence. His phone just wouldn’t connect, as if the number had been disconnected. I thought maybe it was just bad luck, some temporary issue, but after a couple of days… then a week… then two, I started to wonder. The voice on the other end never picked up. It was as if Sam had vanished into thin air.

I tried not to dwell on it, but the longer the silence stretched, the more unsettling it became. Where could he have gone? Why would he leave without a word? Why hadn’t he called back, or texted, or even checked in after all this time?

Then, it was a month before I saw Murphy.

I was shopping at Walmart, picking up a few things for the house, when I ran into him in the aisles. We exchanged quick greetings.

“Hey, man! How’s everything been?” Murphy asked, his usual mischievous grin spreading across his face. But as we talked, something was off. He looked… confused, like there was something he wasn’t saying.

After a few minutes, I couldn’t help myself. I had to bring up Sam.

“Hey, did you hear from Sam recently?” I asked casually, trying to sound nonchalant.

Murphy paused, his eyes narrowing. “Sam?” he asked, his voice laced with confusion. “Who’s Sam? I don’t know anyone by that name.”

I froze. My stomach dropped. “You don’t know Sam?” I asked, disbelief creeping into my voice. “The guy we were all close with in college? Sam! He came over to my place a month ago, remember?”

Murphy shook his head, his face twisting with a mix of confusion and curiosity. “I’m telling you, man, I don’t know anyone named Sam. Are you sure you’ve got the right person? We never had anyone like that in our circle.”

I felt the room spin around me for a moment. My mind raced, trying to reconcile his words with everything I thought I knew.

“Wait…” I stammered, panic creeping up my spine. “You’re sure? He was part of our gang—Jake, you, me, him—we were all together, always pulling pranks, doing everything as a group.”

Murphy just shook his head again, more forcefully this time. “No, man. I think you’re mistaken.”

It took a few seconds for the reality to hit me—hard. I didn’t want to believe it, but the pieces started falling into place, and nothing made sense anymore. What the hell was going on? Why couldn’t Murphy remember Sam?

Still feeling rattled, I decided to call Jake. Maybe Murphy was just messing with me. He was always the quiet one, but he could be a prankster too. Maybe it was a joke, and they were just messing with me… but no. Jake didn’t joke like that.

I grabbed my phone and dialed his number, my heart pounding in my chest.

“Hey, Jake, you remember Sam, right?” I asked as soon as he answered.

There was a long pause on the other end before Jake spoke.

“Sam? Who’s Sam?” he asked, his voice strangely distant. “I don’t know anyone by that name.”

My stomach churned. This wasn’t happening. I couldn’t be hearing this. I had to be dreaming. Sam had been part of our gang—one of the four of us. How could they not remember him?

I hung up the phone, a sinking feeling consuming me. Was this some kind of prank? Was everyone playing along?

But I couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling of something deeply wrong, so I decided to go to Emma’s house. She was the only one I hadn’t spoken to yet. Maybe she’d remember Sam.

I hadn’t seen Emma in years, but we were close in college, and she’d been part of our small circle. We spent a lot of time together back then, but as life happened, we drifted apart. Still, I thought she would be the one to help me make sense of this.

I found her at home, sitting on the porch when I knocked. She greeted me warmly, but after a few moments of casual talk, I couldn’t hold back.

“Hey, do you remember Sam from our college gang?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady. “He came over to my place not too long ago, and… well, no one seems to remember him. Do you know him?”

Emma’s smile faltered, and she stared at me, confused. “Sam? No, I don’t know any Sam,” she said slowly, her voice barely above a whisper. “I don’t know who you’re talking about.”

My entire world seemed to shatter right then.

“What do you mean?” I asked, panic seizing my chest. “We were all friends! You, me, Jake, Murphy… and Sam. He was part of our gang.”

Emma just stared at me, her face completely blank. “There was never a Sam. Are you okay? Maybe you’re just confused.”

It felt like a cold wave had washed over me. My thoughts became a blur. My breath became shallow. I staggered back in disbelief, unable to comprehend what I was hearing.

Desperation led me to the next step. I rushed home, frantic. I sat at my desk, shaking hands hovering over the keyboard. I pulled up our old college website, hoping to find something—anything—that could explain what was happening. I scrolled through alumni lists, dug into old photos, and looked at yearbooks.

And then… there it was.

Nothing.

No Sam. Not a single trace of him.

I searched and searched, but there was no graduate named Sam, no reference to him anywhere on the site. He had never existed.

Had he?

Then it hit me. I remembered an old college trip—one of our last trips together. We took a photo on that trip, the four of us, smiling, carefree. I had it saved in a folder on my computer. I opened it.

But the picture… the picture wasn’t right.

In that photo, there were only three of us. Me, Murphy, and Jake.

Sam wasn’t in the picture. How could that be?

I stared at the photo, my heart pounding in my chest, my vision blurring. How could I have forgotten? How could I have remembered him so vividly when he had never been there?

Who was that person who came to my house that night?
