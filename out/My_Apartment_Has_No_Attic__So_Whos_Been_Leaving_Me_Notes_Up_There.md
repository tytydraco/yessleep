This might be long. I need to share everything. If anything happens to me after this post, someone needs to know what I found.

I moved into a third-floor apartment in March. The building is old, with creaky floors and peeling paint, but the rent was great and I had just lost my job. You take what you can get.

The layout was strange. There was one long hallway with rooms on either side, and the ceiling in the back closet was oddly low. It sloped down just enough to feel off. My landlord mentioned it used to be part of the attic before renovations decades ago.

But there isn’t an attic in this building. That was the first lie.

The first month was fine. It was quiet, too. The building had three other units, and I rarely saw anyone. I liked the solitude. Then things began to change.

Not big things. Not at first.

Cans in the pantry would be rearranged. Lights I had turned off would be on when I returned home. One time, I found my bedroom window cracked open, even though I never touch it — it sticks so badly you have to yank it to get it open.

I blamed myself. Stress. Sleepwalking. Whatever made me feel better.

Then I found the first note.

It was tucked under my pillow. Just plain lined paper with sharp, block handwriting.

“I LIKE YOUR VOICE.”

I felt a chill. I live alone. I hadn’t had anyone over in weeks. I searched the apartment for signs of a break-in — window locks, door frame, even under the sink. Nothing.

I convinced myself it was a prank. Maybe a friend messing with me. But something about the handwriting made my stomach twist. It was too precise, like someone had taken their time.

That night, I slept with a knife under my pillow.

I woke up to find the knife missing — and a new note in its place.

“YOU DON’T NEED THAT.”

That was when I started hearing the sounds.

Soft creaking from above, like footsteps, slow and steady, dragging along the ceiling. It happened mostly between 2 and 4 a.m. I stood on a chair and knocked. Silence. Then — three knocks back.

I almost fell trying to get down.

The closet in the back had always unsettled me. It was too shallow to be useful, and the ceiling dipped oddly low. But that night, I really examined it. I noticed a square outline above, just visible in the cracked plaster. A hatch.

No handle. No hinges. But definitely a hatch.

I texted my landlord and asked if there was any attic space.

His reply:
“No attic. Don’t go in the closet.”

That was it. No explanation. Just that. I didn’t sleep that night.

I started staying out late. I slept on friends’ couches and walked around all night just to avoid the place. But every time I came back, there was a new note waiting.

On the bathroom mirror:
“I LISTEN WHEN YOU SING.”

Inside the microwave:
“THE OTHERS DIDN’T SING.”

On my pillow again:
“DON’T LEAVE ME.”

Then last week, I found a note that changed everything.

Taped to the inside of my bedroom door:
“LOOK UP.”

I did.

For the first time, I noticed it.

The hatch had been moved — not much, maybe an inch — but just enough to see the gap. Just enough to think something had come down. Or was still up there.

I lost it. I grabbed a broom handle and jabbed at the hatch until the whole slab of plaster cracked and dropped. Dust, chunks of wood, and a rotting smell poured out.

I should’ve stopped. But I needed to know.

I stood on a chair, with my phone flashlight in my mouth, and peeked inside.

It wasn’t an attic. Not really. It was more like a crawlspace — maybe four feet high, barely tall enough to crouch in.

What I saw up there…

There was a sleeping bag. A stack of old books. A mug. And dozens of crumpled notes. Some were written on receipts, some on napkins, all in the same blocky handwriting.

But the worst part wasn’t the notes.

It was the photos.

Polaroids. Of me.

Sleeping. Eating. Showering.

And in some of them… I wasn’t alone.

In the far corner of the photo — always just out of focus — was a figure. Gaunt. Pale. Watching.

I scrambled down so fast I fell and cracked my ankle. I crawled to the front door and left it wide open as I limped out.

I stayed in a hotel that night. I returned the next morning with police.

They found the crawlspace. They found the sleeping bag, the photos, the notes.

But no person.

The cops said it was likely a squatter. They must've had another entrance — maybe through the walls. They said the whole building was old and connected in strange ways. They’re investigating.

But yesterday, I got a text from an unknown number.

No words. Just a photo.

Of me, sitting in the hotel lobby, writing this.

I’m not going back. I don’t care what it costs.
If your place feels off, trust your gut. Because sometimes… you’re not alone.
And sometimes, they don’t want to leave.
