The campfire crackled in front of us, the flames making long, flickering shadows against the pine trees. The smells of burnt marshmallow, Hershey’s, and smoke filled the air, morphing into a familiar scent. I glanced over at Jackson, who was poking at the fire with a stick, his face illuminated by the golden glow of the flames. He had that look on his face like he was trying to remember something that had slipped away.

Michael sat beside him, leaning back in his chair, eyes half-closed, his head tilted slightly like he was listening for something, though the only sound was the soft breeze rustling through the trees, just barely enough to stir the leaves.

“This place used to be fun, bro,” Jackson muttered, not really talking to us but to the fire itself, as if he was having a quiet conversation with the past. His voice had this heaviness to it, as if the memories he was thinking of didn’t fit quite right anymore.

“We used to come out here when we were little. Remember, Will?” He turned his head toward me, his eyes catching the firelight for a second.

I nodded, even though the memories that came rushing back weren’t as comforting as they once were. I can remember, clear as daylight, the laughter, the feeling of adventure, the thrill in racing each other through the trees, challenging one another to go further and further into the shadows where the woods grew thick and dark. The forest was alive to us then, part of the fun in its every shift and creaky groan. Every rustling of leaves, every snapped twig beneath my foot was a part of the adventure.

But now, now the forest felt different. Like it was watching. Waiting.

Michael shifted in his chair, the sudden movement breaking the quiet. He sat up straight, his eyes looking at the darkness beyond the circle of light cast by the fire.

“Did you hear that?” His voice was tight, a low whisper as if he did not want to disturb anything that may have been out there.

I froze, straining my ears. But all I heard was the macabre silence of the forest—too still, too quiet, like it was holding its breath. I looked over, expecting to see something step out of the shadows.

Jackson forced a laugh, though it wasn’t like his usual carefree one that we were used to. It was shaking, hollow.

“Relax, man, it’s just the wind or a raccoon or something.”

But I knew it wasn’t the wind. The air was too still for that. Even the pines stood stock-still, their branches unnaturally quiet. And fear raced through me as I thought about something—something I had buried deep after all these years.

The old stories, the ones we used to scare each other with when we were young, stupid kids, the legends about entities that walked the woods. Skinwalkers, wendigos, whatever you wanted to call them. The stories said they could imitate anything, take the form of anyone. But those were just tales, right? Stories meant to pass time at the fire.

I looked over at Michael once more, my breathing quickening and my heartbeat pounding. Because last night, Michael had disappeared. He’d walked off into the woods after hearing some voice calling for him. He swore he’d be right back, but he wasn’t. Hours passed and then he showed up at the fire, sat just where he always did, but something was wrong. His eyes were dull, lifeless, not really focused on anything. His breathing sounded wrong, raspy, like he was breathing through water, each breath strained and shallow.

The thought was too terrible, clawing the back of my mind without words. It wasn’t actually Michael who came back last night, was it?

I opened my mouth to ask something, anything, but before I could, Jackson shot up from his seat, brushing the dirt off his jeans.

“I’m going to grab more wood,” he said, his voice unnaturally cheerful. Without waiting for a reply, he disappeared into the trees, swallowed by the darkness.

“Wait!” I called after him, but the words died in my throat. He was gone.

I turned to Michael at whatever was sitting there pretending to be him. He hadn’t moved. His eyes were still fixed on the fire, but something about the way he was sitting made my skin crawl. Slowly, he turned his head toward me, and that’s when I saw it. The way his lips curled into an eerie, unnatural smile, too slow, too controlled. His face was too still, too empty, like something was wearing it as a mask.

And in that moment, I knew whoever, whatever was sitting there by the fire, it wasn’t my friend.

The wind picked up again, a sharp gust that made the flames flicker and the shadows dance wildly around us. But there was something else in the wind now. Whispers. Faint, almost too quiet to hear, but they were there, weaving through the trees, circling the fire. They weren’t human. They were something older, something dark, something that had been here long before us.

I glanced toward the trees where Jackson had disappeared, but he hadn’t come back. It had been two hours, and there was no sign of him. My heart raced, the fear twisting tighter in my chest. I wasn’t sure how much longer I could sit here, waiting, with whatever was pretending to be Michael, knowing something was out there in the woods, watching us, hunting us.

And then, just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, the fire flickered again, and a new sound broke through the stillness.

A footstep.

The fire had long since burned down to a faint glow, and the cold began to seep into my bones. The woods seemed to swallow all sound, save for the occasional crack of a branch somewhere far off. I couldn’t tell if it was Jackson out there, or something else. I needed to do something, anything other than just sit and wait for it to happen!

I stood up, keeping my eyes on Michael or whatever he was, and took a slow step backward, my foot crunching softly on the pine needles below. Michael’s head snapped up, his eyes locking onto mine. His mouth opened, and the raspy, waterlogged voice slipped out.

“Where are you going, Will?”

There was something broken in the way he spoke, an uneasy tone that made the hair on my neck stand up. I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady, throw them off, pretend I know nothing.

“I’m just getting more wood, Michael. We need to keep the fire going.”

He stood up, moving in a way that was too stiff, like someone who wasn’t used to their own body. His eyes never left mine, and that unnatural smile still lingered on his lips.

“I’ll come with you. It’s not safe to be alone.”

I wanted to say no, to tell him to stay put, but the words wouldn’t come. Instead, I nodded, feeling the weight of fear pressing down on me. Together, we stepped away from the dying fire, moving deeper into the forest. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to run, but I kept my pace slow, careful not to turn my back on him.

The whispers were louder now, slithering between the trees, seeming to come from every direction. I tried to focus, to figure out where Jackson might have gone, but it was impossible with Michael so close. He walked beside me, his eyes looking straight ahead. His movements were awkward, as if he had never walked on his legs before, mimicking how a human would manage. My mind was racing, searching for a way out—a plan to get away from him without drawing his attention.

Then, all of a sudden, Michael stopped and looked to the distance, shaking violently, to listen for something only he could hear. He turned to me; that smile widened.

“Do you hear it, Will?” he asked, his voice barely a whisper. “They’re calling for you now.”

Fear jolted through my veins, and I stepped backward, my eyes darting toward the darkness. The whispers grew louder, echoing my name, wrapping around me like a cold wind. I couldn’t tell if it was real, but I knew I had to get out of there.

I turned and ran without saying anything. The branches scratched at my face, the ground uneven beneath my feet as I pushed myself forward, away from Michael, away from whatever was out there. I didn’t look back, not even when I heard his footsteps pounding after me, his voice calling my name in that horrible, distorted tone.

I ran until my lungs burned, until my legs threatened to give out, until the whispers faded and there was only the sound of my own breathing and the distant crackle of the dying fire.

I stumbled to a halt roughly, my heart turning into a jackhammer in my chest, my gaze scanning the darkness. There was no sign of Michael or Jackson. I was quite alone. The forest loomed around me, the trees like silent sentinels, their branches twisting in the wind.

Within a few seconds, I realized there was no going back, no more normal. Not to the campfire, not to the safety of the past. Whatever was out here with us, it wasn’t going to let us leave. Not all of us.
