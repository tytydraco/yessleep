7th July 2022.

A purple sky, neon lights, and weird cyborg-type humans?!

What am I looking at? Am I dreaming? No, certainly not. It all began when...

My father and I don't have a strong bondâ€”yeah, typical father-son issue. My father was (yeah, he died recently) a strange person. He went missing for months, and because of that, my mother got separated from him about 7 years ago. Although he was a very nice person and was good to all of us (my mom, me, and my little brother) even after the separation, he took care of us. So, none of us hold any grudge?! against him. He gave us gifts on Christmas, and we visited various tourist destinations after my parents separated. There is no clear reason for their separation. Thus, I tend to dislike both my parents. I asked them both many times, but they refused to tell me. Although my little brother loves them both, I do so with a grudge.

So, I received a letter (strange, who sends letters in this 21st century? Obviously, it was from my father) - "If you are reading this, Jake (This is my name), I am probably dead!!"

A strange feeling!! Am I crying? Why am I feeling sad? That hit me hard, but I controlled myself. I read further, and there are instructions to the secret chamber in my father's house, and the envelope contains a key to that chamber. I remember when I was a kid, I went to my father's room and found a hidden chamber, but it was locked. My father and mother immediately stopped me and scolded me.

My first thought was to inform my mother and brother about my father, but I immediately refused it. I know my mother would definitely stop me if I informed her about my father's death and the key I received. Even the letter was sent only to me, so there must be a reason for it. It was hard, but I should keep it to myself for now.

So, I went to my family's old house where the chamber is. My father still owns that house and lived there before his death. When I entered the house, I got emotional. I spent my entire childhood there. I was 12, and my brother was 7 years old when we left that house, and we have very good memories attached to it. And when I entered, I cried. I don't know, maybe it's because of my father's death or because of my memories of this house, or maybe both. Strange!! But we can't even understand our own feelings.

I controlled my emotions and went directly to my father's room where the chamber was. I opened the chamber; it was not big, just a small one like an almirah. There was a strange metallic box inside with ancient engravings. When I opened it, there was a wrist bend that felt like it was centuries old. I had an urge to put it on, so I did. At that moment, I saw...

A purple sky, neon lights, and weird cyborg-type humans.

I immediately took off the bend; my heart was pumping really fast! Was I dreaming? No, I am quite awake. But what is happening to me? First, my father's death and now this?!

I calmed myself, put the bend back in the box, and took the box with me.

What!? Why is this whole room so clean?! I suddenly realized that my father's room was all new. Was it the same when I entered the room? What if I ignored it because of my heavy emotions? I went out of the room; it was strange, but the whole house was clean and felt like new. I ignored it and directly went to the car I parked in the garden. I immediately started driving to my house.

Oh, I forgot to mention that I live in a different house than my mother and brother. I shifted here during my early high school days, initially rent was paid by my mother, but now I'm paying it.

To cut it short, I went to my house. It was almost night when I entered, so I took a shower and went to sleep, thinking that I will think about what happened to me later in the morning. It was not the best sleep I had, but due to tiredness, I immediately fell asleep and woke up to the sound of my mobile alarm.

It was 8:00 am, and it was 7th January 2022.

For a second, I didn't realize, but then...

"7th January!?" How is this possible!?

I went online to check it! Yeah, all articles, news, and posts are 6 months older.

I panicked; my heart was beating really fast!

Where is the box?! I thought.

I wasn't able to find the box. I calmed myself. Yes! It is in the bathroom; I suddenly remembered. When I entered my house and took a shower, I put the box somewhere in the bathroom.

I immediately went to the bathroom and fortunately, I found the box there. I immediately opened the box, and guess what? There was a small note along with the bend, written as,

"Welcome, my son!!"
