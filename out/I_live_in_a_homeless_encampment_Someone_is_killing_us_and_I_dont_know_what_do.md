I’m a longtime lurker here. I’ve created a throwaway account because I don’t want anything being traced back to me or for someone to get too involved. Don’t take it personally. After five years on the streets, I’m naturally suspicious of everyone. However, I’ve browsed this sub whenever I visit the local library. This sounds crazy, but with everyone’s experiences, I think I may find some answers here.   
  
So here we go.  
  
A couple of housekeeping rules before we begin:  


1. Yes, I am homeless. How I got here isn’t important or even interesting. I grew up in foster care and then robbed a liquor store with one of my former foster brothers after I aged out. Spent some time in the can and soon discovered you can’t make it in this world with a second-degree felony hanging over you. 
2. No, I don’t need your help. I’m looking for guidance, not a couch to surf on or a couple of home-cooked meals. Like I said, don’t take it personally! The internet still gives us some degree of anonymity, and I do not want to endanger anyone’s life. I don’t plan on being homeless forever, but that’s a decision I have to make for myself. 
3. I’ve never suffered from a severe mental illness, nor am I a serious drug user. I’ve had bouts of anxiety and depression, but my mind is clear. I’m not hallucinating, and I’m not high. 

Okay, with that being said, I moved to the encampment in the summer of 2019. I had terrible experiences with shelters, and a friend suggested I save enough money for a tent and move into the encampment under the I-59 overpass. People looked out for each other there. I “borrowed” a tent from Home Depot and then settled into a small patch of land without issue. I figured I would stay here, find a job, save enough money for a new place to live, and then begin the rest of my life.  
  
Of course, I was naive at the time. No one would hire me, so I resorted to panhandling and shoplifting. I mostly kept to myself until one day, one of my “neighbors” reached out to me. His name was Hop, and he shared a tent with his buddy Squid. We became fast friends, and Hop offered me a job to work with him as a night-shift janitor at a nearby office building.   
  
Hop and Squid were lifers. Both served lengthy prison sentences and, after trial and error, moved into the encampment around the same time. Like me, they figured the camp would be temporary but grew to learn it was anything but. “Once you get settled,” Hop would say, “you don’t want to do nothing else.”   
  
The two educated me on encampment life and the credo of the streets. Most rules involved keeping your hands off other people’s things. That was a non-negotiable. Those who were caught stealing soon found themselves banished from the camp.   
  
You also were expected to look out for each other and respect the camp. Interlopers like the cops or social workers were not to be trusted. This was a community, and trust was sacred. Those who disrupted the peace were quickly dealt with by camp leaders. We all knew the city wanted to move us elsewhere, so it was vital to mind your p’s and q’s.  
  
I settled in quickly. I’d start my days by reading every book I could find in the library and then meet Hop and Squid downtown for our night shift. It soon became a routine and then turned into my livelihood. It was really the first time I had ever been stable and happy.   
  
Then, things changed.  
  
It was two weeks ago, during the intense heat of the summer. Chico, another denizen we were acquainted with, struck gold. A commuter accidentally gave Chico a $100 bill while panhandling by a Starbucks. He had won the lottery, and most street-smart campers would keep their riches to themselves.  
  
Chico, however, was known to be braggadocious and puffed out his chest while regaling the tale of his newfound wealth. Word traveled quickly through the camp, and I came home from the library to an unusual ruckus.  
  
Not surprisingly, Chico’s money was gone. Someone had broken the cardinal rule, and now Chico was tearing through the encampment to find the culprit. Soon, Brother Billy was called to the scene.  
  
Brother Billy was essentially “the mayor” of our encampment. He settled disputes between residents and made decisions on who could enter and who must leave. Brother Billy was generally fair and even friendly, but the goons who carried out his bidding were anything but.   
  
Chico had narrowed down his accusations to two people, JJ…and Squid. JJ had been a troublemaker in the past but calmly denied the allegations and offered to let Brother Billy’s henchmen search his tent. Squid was beside himself, and Hop had to hold him back from swinging on Chico.   
  
Brother Billy’s boys searched JJ and his tent and came up with nothing. But what happened next was entirely unexpected. Hop and Squid were the most respected camp members outside of Brother Billy. Billy even asked the two for counsel on complex issues and hung out with us every so often. To accuse Squid of stealing was unconscionable, and I assumed Billy wouldn’t entertain the thought.  
  
But Brother Billy ordered their tent to be searched as well.  
  
This was different. This was blatant disrespect, and I wondered what had caused such a slight. Hop and Squid silently watched as their things were turned over in the tent. I could feel the rage burning from their faces. The goons, of course, also found nothing.  
  
Brother Billy then called a meeting at the center of the camp. If Chico’s money wasn’t returned by tomorrow morning, everyone’s tents would be searched. The three of us then went to work. Hop and Squid didn’t speak a word during our entire shift.  
  
The camp was devoid of any activity that night. No music, no chatter, and no liquor was spilled. I remember not being able to fall asleep, shaken by the events of the day. Around three in the morning, I felt a gust of wind followed by the shuffling of footsteps outside my tent. I peeked outside but only saw darkness.  
  
I awoke around three in the morning to Hop at my tent flap. “Come on, boy,” he whispered. “We got a problem.” We tiptoed to the edge of the encampment to meet Brother Billy and his chief lieutenant, Anthony. They were standing over a body.  
  
It was Chico. He was sprawled out on the ground, and his neck had been twisted to the back of his body. His eyes were still open, and his mouth was agape like he had been screaming.   
  
The 100-dollar bill was folded neatly in his back pocket.  
  
Deaths happened semi-regularly in the encampment. Usually, it was an overdose or someone with health problems had passed in the night. But murder? It was almost unthinkable. Even with all his flaws, Brother Billy ensured disagreements were solved non-violently. Violence attracted the police.   
  
My blood froze. Where was Squid?  
  
“He ain’t here,” Hop whispered solemnly.   
  
Brother Billy ordered Chico’s body to be disposed of when night fell. He also requested that someone quietly summon JJ since his past history made him the likely suspect. No word was to be spoken of Chico’s death until the time was right. Billy then called Hop over for a private conversation.  
  
Anthony and I went to JJ’s tent and knocked on his flap. There was a  long moment of silence before Anthony decided to barge in. We were greeted by a putrifying odor and JJ.  
  
He was dead, too, wrapped up in his sleeping bag with a giant gash on his forehead. His face had the same expression of terror as Chico’s did. Nothing else in JJ’s tent was touched. It appeared that someone entered his tent, bashed him, and then promptly left.  
  
We hurried back to where Brother Billy and Hop were and told him what had happened. Billy swore under his breath and loudly demanded that Hop locate Squid. The two began arguing, and the commotion caused people to sleepily get out of their tents only to discover that one of their own had been murdered.  
  
Chaos erupted throughout the camp. People began to point fingers at each other, and Brother Billy’s boys broke up several fights. The flames were quickly extinguished when three or four squad cars burst onto the scene. A few were arrested, and a quiet unease drifted into encampment.   
  
Thankfully, the cops were too invested in handcuffing the homeless to notice there were two dead bodies among them. Night fell, and people stayed zipped up into their tents while Billy plotted his next move. Hop and I called in sick to work.  
  
We needed to find Squid.  
  
Brother Billy ordered that everyone needed to stay in their tents, but Hop bribed one of the guards and we slipped out in the night. We walked a few miles in silence until Hop led me to an abandoned storage facility.   
  
“Got to remember which one it is,” Hop muttered to himself while trying the locks on each unit. Finally, he found and unlocked one, and rolled up the metal door. Inside the unit was another sleeping bag, a hot plate, and a locked trunk. In the corner was a lead pipe with dried splotches of blood on it.  
  
“God dammit, Squid!” Hop yelled and slammed his fist into the concrete wall. He then turned to look at me. “Let’s get out of here.” My heart sank as we tiptoed out of the storage center, crushed at the thought of what our friend had done.   
  
Hop stopped in his tracks. We saw a figure watching us from under the storage facilities lone street light. It was Squid, or at least it looked like him. I could make out the faded Red Sox cap he always wore in the distance.  
  
“AYO SQUID!” Hop hollered.   
  
But Squid took off, sprinting like a maniac, faster than I had seen any human run before. We chased after him, screaming for him to talk to us. We followed Squid past the old railroad tracks and down to a crossed off section of the harbor. Squid stopped running, shaking furiously like a rabid animal. His back was turned away from us.  
  
I’m not sure how to explain what happened next, and to this day, I’m not sure what even happened. Thank god Hop was with me, because I don’t think anyone else would believe what we saw.  
  
Squid stopped breathing, and calmly stood up straight. I tried to call out after him, but was too winded from running to make a sound.  
  
And then, all of a sudden, Squid disappeared. It was like he dissipated, taken away by an unseeable force. His clothes dropped to the ground, and then Hop and I felt a violent gust of wind that knocked us to our feet.   
  
“What the fuck….” Hop heaved. We stared at each other in disbelief before realizing that the sun was about to come up. We hustled back home to another commotion.   
  
Another person had been killed.   
  
This time, it was Ms. Mary, who had been homeless for longer than I had been alive. She was like the sweet old lady who lived on your block and occasionally gave you candy. They found her crumpled under her dusty walker.   
  
Naturally, all suspicions pointed to us. Brother Billy was furious that we had defied his orders, and despite our alibi being solid, he banished us from camp until things had calmed down. Hop and I quietly packed our things, and then moved to Squid’s old storage unit.   
  
We’ve spent nearly every day looking for Squid, but there’s no sign of him. The things he left behind haven’t given us any clues. All we know is that he quite literally disappeared, and despite combing every book in the library for answers, we’re more lost than ever before.  
  
So that’s it. I apologize if I rambled on too long, but I’m not sure what our next move would be. I don’t believe in ghosts or spirits, but I know that what we saw couldn’t have been caused by a human.  I miss the camp, and I’m worried that someone, something is still terrorizing our friends.   
  
The nights are getting longer. We'll have to move soon, as the storage unit isn't equipped for the coming cold front. Not only that, but the atmosphere seems even more hostile than the encampment. We were never really welcome anywhere, but I can feel it in my bones that we're in danger. Hop and I sleep in shifts as the noises we hear at night don't sound like the usual bumps and groans. 

Someone, something, is hunting us.
