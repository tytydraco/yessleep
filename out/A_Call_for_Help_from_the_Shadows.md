It was just a normal day when I received a text from my old friend, Sarah. I hadn't heard from her in years, so I was surprised when I saw her name pop up on my phone. The message read, "I need your help. Meet me at our old hangout spot tonight at midnight. Don't tell anyone."

I was confused. I didn't know what Sarah could need help with, but something in my gut told me to go. That night, I headed to the park where we used to spend our summers together as teenagers. As I walked down the dark path, I felt a sense of unease creeping up on me.

When I arrived at the spot, I found Sarah sitting on a bench, her eyes were dark and hollow, and her skin was pale. I could tell something was very wrong. But before I could say anything, Sarah grabbed my arm and pulled me close.

"I need your help," Sarah whispered. "I've been seeing things, hearing things, and I can't sleep. I think I'm losing my mind."

I was taken aback. I had never seen Sarah like this, and it scared me. But being the good friend that I was, I offered to help. I suggested that Sarah see a doctor or a therapist, but Sarah refused, saying that she didn't want anyone to think she was crazy.

As we sat there in the dark, I noticed something moving in the shadows. At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but as the figure grew closer, I realized it looked like a man. He was tall and grossly thin, with a twisted grin on his face.

"Who are you?!" I demanded.

The man didn't reply. Instead, he lunged at us, and we both bolted down the path, sprinting as fast as we could. We ran until we came to a dead end, and the man cornered us. I tried to fight him off, but he was unnaturally strong.

As he held me down, I heard Sarah's screams. But when I turned to look, I saw that Sarah wasn't fighting back. Instead, she was staring at the man with a look of pure terror on her face.

At that moment, I realized that Sarah wasn't seeing things. The man was real, and he was after her. I tried to talk to Sarah, to snap her out of her trance, but it was too late. The man had taken her.

I ran for my life, but I knew deep down that the man would come for me, too. I didn't know who he was, or why he was after us, but I knew that we were in danger. And as I stumbled down the dark path, I realized that Sarah had been right. I was losing my mind, and no one would believe me when I told them what had happened.

As I tried to make sense of what had just happened, I couldn't shake the feeling that the man was still out there, watching me, waiting. And I knew that no matter how hard I tried to forget, I would never be able to escape the horror that had unfolded that night.
