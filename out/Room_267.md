 

It was the 23rd of December 2010 when I would become part of something greater than me something greater than us all. I was what would be considered hired muscle even though I preferred the term "Private soldier". It was about 5:30 pm when I received an offer of employment from what I will call "The Organization" Following my acceptance of the contract I was taken to a place they refer to as "Site 15". In Site 15 they held many strange and anomalous beings. The site was composed of about 5 levels of underground facilities composing barracks labs and about 300 containment cells.

In my time there I saw what was being held in about 50 of these cells. Most cells only used Criminals as the test subjects, but the Organization wasn't too worried about using a traitorous guard or scientist every once in a while. It was these circumstances that led me to Room 267. In the room there at first glance was nothing.

Damn was I wrong. Out of seemingly the air itself materialized a being that I could only describe as one the most horrifying things I have ever seen.

It looked as if it was nothing but eyes one moment the next a mass of flesh and limbs.

It changed form every few seconds. I just stood there confused and terrified

and then it started moving towards me.

The being grabbed me with things unseen and for a second just stared at me silently analyzing judging.

It apparently using nothing but its mind or maybe an unseen blade started slowly stripping the skin of my flesh as I just stood there unable to move helpless as it slowly moved from limb to limb. It started at my legs going up to my torso then my arms but when it reached my head it stopped for a moment. I then felt an intense pain in my eyes I closed them hoping it would go away but when they opened again, I saw nothing. My skin was seemingly untouched or so I thought. I looked down and saw massive scars held together by some kind of vile fluid. The creature was gone or at least unseen even though I could still feel judging disgusted eyes watching me. My punishment for crimes I shall not say was complete and I was released from the contract. I have not sought any kind of therapy for this as my story would be viewed as nothing more, but delusions made up by a broken mind.

However, every once in a while, I feel judging disgusted eyes watching me. It is always when I least expect it. I may be working at my new job or laying in bed with my s/o only to feel that exact wave of emotions I felt in room 267. At first, I thought it would just watch me then it started talking to me. It often times tried to convince me to kill myself for my crimes against its "Divine plan". Calling me things such as the "Opposer of order" and "Puppet of anarchy". It talked to me for about 30 minutes each time. Trying to educate me on the importance of the Divine plan and how my crimes against it and thus the universe itself were unforgivable and that I deserved what it did to me and more. It told me of other beings such as the Grand architect and how her death was necessary for the Divine plan or the Synthony of dawn and how his death was necessary to the Divine plan etc. etc.

Around September I unexpectedly received an email from the Organization telling me the I should no longer be hearing the voice of entity in my head and that any and all feelings of disgust I may have for anyone protesting, exercising free will, and otherwise being what would be considered unorder full in the creature's mind should disappear soon Aswell.

Overall, I have mostly recovered from these fateful events and am currently leading a normal-ish life.
