when i was walking down the sidewalk at night i was talking to my friend tanner when we saw that we had already walked to the end of the block. so me and tanner decided to keep walking since we had nothing better to do, and we saw this guy on a golf cart just cruising around the street which was strange since it was like 11pm. anyways, we kept on walking and talking about our day and gossiping about people at school until we had already walked to the main road which had a lot of cars speeding past us and there was a wendy's, a mcdonalds, some kind of loan place, and two bars that were parallel of each other.

when we peeked through the wooden fences of the bar on the right there was a hotel and a diner next to the bar but, when we peeked through the fences to look at the bar on the left there was a white limousine that was a bit dirtied up a little as if it drove through a dirt road. anyway, me and tanner sat down on the sidewalk and we were still talking about whatever we were talking about earlier when me and tanner both heard a load thud. as if somebody inside the limo was trying to kick the window out or something.

so then me and tanner thought it was a pretty good idea to start walking back to his house but before we could take a step... we heard the window of the limo break and somebody climbed out of it and saw us trying to run away. so, he decided to try to chase after us! me and tanner started running as fast as we possibly could until we got to his house. since we were having a sleep over at his house we decided to call it a night and go to sleep. somehow, someway, we were actually able to get some sleep.

when me and tanner woke up his mom lindy was cooking breakfast for us before we woke up. then, me and tanner went to the kitchen to see what miss lindy was cooking for us but when we sat down at the minibar, there was a knock at our door. miss lindy went to go answer it and it was the police! the cops and miss lindy talked for like 10 minutes and then she came back into the kitchen to cook more of the breakfast. me and tanner asked why the police were at the door and miss lindy told us that there was a report of somebody attempting to escape a kidnapping by breaking through a limousine window in the area, she said the police was there because they wanted to see if she had knew anything about it and she said no.

me and tanner both looked at each other in unison and our jaws dropped. when miss lindy asked us what was wrong, we told her that we just both think that what had happened was crazy...
