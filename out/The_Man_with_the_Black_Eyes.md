Whenever I stayed at my grandma’s house in Ukraine, strange things would happen. I’d have visions—of the future, of people I’d never seen before. Then, days later, I’d run into those exact people in real life. It wasn’t just dreams or déjà vu. It was as if her apartment amplified something in me, tuned me into something unseen.

My grandma is a deeply spiritual woman. She lives alone in an old, creaking building tucked away in a small town, far from any city. The building itself carries a heavy energy. There’s a woman on the first floor—rumored to be a witch. People say she’s been sexually intimate with demons and ghosts. Whether it’s true or not, the entire building has a history of unexplained, often disturbing, activity.

One night, Grandma was reading her Bible before bed. She was alone, as usual, in her little top-floor apartment. Suddenly, someone knocked on her door. She looked through the peephole—and saw a hooded figure with horns. Demon horns. Not costume horns, not symbolic ones. Real ones. Hardened. Sharp. Without hesitation, she began yelling prayers, shouting scripture into the hallway. And the thing outside her door—whatever it was—scurried away, fast and silent, like wind rushing down the stairs.

That’s the kind of place my grandma lives in.

On one particular visit, I was sharing the spare bedroom with my cousin. Just before we went to sleep, I turned to her and said, “I keep seeing this face whenever I close my eyes. A man. I’ve never seen him before.” I described him exactly: “He has pitch-black eyes, and the skin around his eyes is dark too. He has black hair, a darker skin tone, not very tall—but terrifying. There’s something about him that just feels wrong.”

We brushed it off and went to sleep.

The next day, my younger sister and our little cousin were playing outside near the building’s playground. My cousin and I had gone to grab ice cream from a nearby store. As we were walking back, my sister and younger cousin came running toward us—faces pale, eyes wide. They were clearly shaken. And we hadn’t told them a thing about the man from my vision.

“We were going up the stairs,” they said, “and a man came around the corner.” They started describing him—and my cousin and I stopped cold. It was the exact same description I’d given her the night before.

We didn’t want to walk back alone, so we called our grandma. She came down immediately. She didn’t say much—just pulled us in close and walked with us.

We were heading up the stairs—third, maybe fourth floor—when he appeared.

The man from my vision stepped out from a corner in the hallway, right in front of us. He looked straight at me and my cousin. And we tried to scream. We tried. But it felt like something was holding our mouths shut. Like an invisible hand clamped over our faces.

Then, he stepped aside. Just moved out of the way, silently, and let us pass.

We didn’t look back. We just kept walking, huddled around Grandma.

I think—no, I know—if she hadn’t been there, it would’ve gone differently. She knows every spirit, every strange presence that moves through that building. And I think whatever he was… he recognized her. And he backed off.
