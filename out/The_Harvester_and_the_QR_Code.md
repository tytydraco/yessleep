My recent interest in cosmic horror had me browsing page after page, scrolling through posts for hours on end. I interacted with hundreds of unknown people... or shall I say, unknown IDs?

  
I knew none of their real names. Only the usernames they chose to wear.



One such encounter would set the stage for the nightmare that followed — a predicament born of curiosity and sealed by my own mistake.



The ID was called **Harvester**.  
At first, I thought it was a fan.  
"Well done," Harvester commented on all my posts.  
A personal message would arrive immediately after I posted a story.  
Request after request to share my content.



*"Do I have your consent?"* Harvester asked.  
*"Yes, sure man, go ahead,"* I always answered.



On one occasion, Harvester asked,  
*"Can I send you a link where I shared your work?"*  
*"Yes, sure man, go ahead,"* I said again.



But it wasn't a link that arrived.  
It was a QR code.  
No message, nothing but the image...  
Except a small line beneath it:  
**"You have to see this."**



Coming from an IT background, trained for years in cybersecurity, I knew better.  
Never scan links from untrusted sources.



But... my curiosity had consumed me.  
I wanted to know. I *needed* to know.



So I scanned it.  
That was my **first mistake**.



The QR code brought me to a site —  
Pages and pages scanned from some ancient book.  
The language was one I'd never seen.  
It resembled Nordic runes... but older, rawer.  
The pages looked dusty, almost moldy, as though they hadn't been touched by human hands in centuries.



I dismissed it as a prank.  
I shrugged and moved on.



**The next day, I saw it.**



On the shelf in my study, tucked between some books...  
A small, stone-like object.  
Shiny, alien, yet somehow *familiar*, as if it had always been there.  
Its surface glowed a faint green in the sunlight.



I leaned closer.  
And that's when my blood turned to ice.



The same runes from the QR pages now appeared on the stone.  
They *appeared* — because I swear they weren't there seconds ago.  
And worse... they moved.  
The runes shifted and twisted like something was typing *into* the stone.



It drew me closer, an irresistible pull.  
I reached out and touched it.



That was my **final mistake**.



Instantly, I felt it — something crawling through my brain.  
No pain, only the sensation of my mind being... *rewritten.*  
My eyes closed.  
I blacked out.



When I woke, my study was wrecked.  
My heavy wooden desk — shattered.  
Shelves torn apart.  
I don't know how. I don't have that kind of strength.  
But somehow... something inside me *does.*



Since then, the blackouts have continued.  
I don't know for how long each time.  
Hours? Days?



In the dark, in my dreams, I *become* something else.  
I see without seeing.  
I leap across impossible distances.  
I sprout new limbs — pincers the size of chairs.  
I devour poor souls who wander into my dreams.  
Sometimes, I fly.



Now, the moments of clarity — like the one I'm in now — are rare.  
That’s why I'm posting this while I still can.



I can now read and understand the runes in that cursed manuscript.  
They tell of an ancient experiment.  
Not by gods.  
Not by demons.



By *them.*



**Beings we do not know about.**  
**Beings who know about us.**  
**Beings who are actively hunting.**



This is my warning to you:



**Do not scan unknown QR codes.**  
**Do not click unknown links.**



Or you might lose not just your humanity —  
But your soul.
