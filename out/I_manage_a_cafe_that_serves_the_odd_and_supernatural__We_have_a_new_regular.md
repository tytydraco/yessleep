My name is Axel and I manage the Drowsy Spectre, a café positioned in a place that should get little business. Well, little human business, that is. It is always hard to tell at first if they are just travelers who wandered into the weirder places, or if they merely look the part. 

So when a new face comes walking through our doors– all smiles and bright, friendly eyes– I have to be on guard because I have an unreasonably long list of bad experiences in my three years working here.

\--------------------------------------

Bars and other coffee spots contend with regulars that have their list of unspoken rules; only eight cubes of ice in the cup or requiring you call out their instagram handle instead of their name. Don’t call that guy sir, don’t try to give this other person their change because it goes in the tip jar. People expect their individual rules to be remembered or, in some cases, learned without any instructions at all. Break them, and experience their small but temporary wrath.

At the Drowsy Spectre, our customers have rules too, only the punishment for breaking them is anything but small. From an annoying bald man whose camera chips away at the souls it captures to an overtly friendly giant that turns anyone who trusts it into soup; things do not go well for anyone when someone breaks the rules. Hell, one time the entire shop got thrown into thick darkness and we were almost condemned to the black for all eternity. 

Sadly, most of the rules that we have were written down at the hurt of others. I’ve added a few of my own rules to Selene’s list. She was the manager before me and had a much *longer* run. She’s gone though. Gone, along with the original staff I worked with when I started. All new faces for me and our turnover rate is so high that those faces are refreshed again and again. Right when I am starting to really get to know someone, maybe even trust them, something comes along and eats them. The worst thing is that the new hires don’t understand the weird rules half the time, or don’t believe in the consequences at all.

But our new regular was a fresh experience for all of us, even those with any sense of seniority. 

I pulled into the lot at sunset. The shop is only open at night– I know, weird for a café. I waited for everyone else to arrive, supervising their entry subtly through hellos and greetings, making sure none of them approached the candle saleswoman near our drive thru. Amber called out ambiguously, not using any names, trying her best to lure anyone over to either buy her candles or fall for one of her word tricks. Only once everyone was inside did I flip our open sign on right at 6:00pm. That wasn’t consistent– sometimes the rules changed and there was nothing to do but roll with the punches. 

Flipping the sign, however, is a matter of seconds and accuracy.

And with our opening came the spell that protected us from the things that stalked the woods and prowled the lengthening shadows of the highway outside. Until the shop closed in the morning, no one was allowed to leave unless express permission was given. I have methods to protect people out in the dark but those are not guaranteed and are extremely *temporary*.

Unfortunately the spell only keeps out those creatures that have violent intent without rules. Any other strange thing can enter freely so long as they have reasonable criteria to enter a violent state. Reasonably is defined absurdly loosely so, despite our protections, every new face that walks in makes my back stiffen.

Unlike Selene, I choose to remain on the floor and behind the bar during the majority of my shift. I was the first to see Smiles and knew from his face and his stiff walk that he was going to be trouble. Real trouble or supernatural, I could not guess, but no one with a demeanor like him is reasonable to deal with. I found myself *hoping* that he was some kind of supernatural creature.

“Hey there!” He chimed once he was across the threshold. The blonde kept that big smile on his face all the way to the counter where he planted himself in front of Carlie. “You got any new seasonal specials?”

It seemed he ran out of words because his mouth halted in a big, open jaw grin and stayed there. Both Carlie and I caught on quick; when it came to new supernatural customers, rules had to be picked up on fast. 

“Sure, on that menu behind me. It cycles through.”

“Wow! Wow! It looks amazing!” He gawked at everything but the menu, not bothering to read any ingredients. “I’ll take the seasonal special! A big one! Hot and with marshmallows, caramel drizzle, mocha drizzle, peppermint toppings, and extra whip cream.” He made sure to wait until Carlie had written it all down on a cup before adding. “I’ll have that in a mug!”

Typically compliance was a good rule of thumb around these things. “Okay, sure.” Carlie wrote the order on a slip of paper. 

Now we have a cash drawer with a POS system, but we hardly use it. Demanding something from the creatures we serve is a terrible idea. They understand the concept of commerce and comprehend that to get something you must trade equal value. Equal value, however, means vastly different things between the countless species of the strange and supernatural. 

Organs, hair, dirt, wood carvings, cursed objects, teeth, sayings, pieces of wisdom.

Or, in Smile’s case, a handshake.

He performed his robotic, stiff walk over to the bar to watch me make his drink. Smiles stared, living up to the name I’ve given him. Now we have a stiff rule not to share your name with anyone– coworker or customer– but we do wear nametags. The discovery of a name via text has yet to be dangerous amid our clientele. Eventually he leaned forward and read my name tag.  

“Axel?!” Smiles laughed, his eyes wide with awe. “My name is Axel too!”

His name was Smiles, he just didn’t know that. “That’ll make it easier to remember.” I tried an awkward laugh, not knowing how the creature intended to behave. Typically the hungry ones were actively looking for a slip up. They cast nets into the sea hoping one of us fish would wander in. 

It didn’t help that I was the only true human on staff. Often times I was the target, the best pick for a meal.

I highly doubted Smiles’ claim but didn’t contest it. He clicked his tongue and shook his head. “Wow. I’m your favorite customer then, right?”

Questions were as dangerous as they were awkward. The obvious, positive answers tended to make things go very badly. I’d say yes, enter some kind of unseen contract that would force me to follow Smiles around as his personal servant or skin and quarter myself so that he can eat. Or no– which would be rude– and being rude usually results in violent, sudden death.

The best practice was to dodge the question and pick up on any clues as to what sort of creature was being dealt with. “Favorite? We just met.”

“So no?”

“Not at all! I just haven’t had time to decide.”

“But I am not your favorite customer *right* now?”

“I don’t know, I have to think about it.”

“I really need you to answer. Like, actually say it.”

“That isn’t something that I can decide so easily.”

“I am into verbal confirmation.” He grinned wide, waiting patiently, no doubt confident that he had trapped me. I didn’t even know for certain that I was walking into a new rule and I was starting to get annoyed. “Just say that I am your favorite.”

Rather than saying anything, I just shrugged. 

Smiles began drinking his latte. “Thank you, Axel!” He said with a bit of a wink, as if our supposedly shared name was some kind of grand secret that bound us together. Smiles wandered the shop’s two lobbies, sipping his mug as he stopped to examine walls and chairs as if at some kind of museum. 

“What do you think?” I asked Carlie.

Everything about her suggested she was a normal person. Sometimes, however, things weren’t right. That was the way of the supernatural. Look for the things that didn’t match. Her right hand had only four fingers. That would change with beings like her. One day her eyes would be a different color, or one arm would be longer than the other.

But she was peaceful and she didn’t have rules. Those were the most basic of requirements for working at the Drowsy Spectre. Having supernatural types on staff saved my ass more than once.

“Oh, he’s weird.” She confirmed what I already knew. “Super weird.”

“Yeah but did you pick up on anything specific? Do you know what he is?”

“Judging by that whole name thing, he seems like a mimic, and a bad one at that. He wants you to say he is your favorite as confirmation that he is doing a good job mimicking.”

That made sense. “So he is a mimic, then?”

“Doubt it.”

“What?”

She shrugged. “He is *like* a mimic.”

We watched him wander around the store some more. Eventually he made for the door and I thought he was finally going to leave. Instead, we made eye contact and he halted. There was that stupid smile again! He marched over, mug in hand, and returned it with two thirds of his latte still remaining. I waited for him to do something but he just stood there, grinning!

Then came the song. He started singing See You Again, the one by Wiz Khalifa, but replaced friend with Axel. I had to suffer through the entire thing wondering if he intended on casting some kind of spell with the song but interrupting him seemed dangerous too.

Eventually he stopped, waiting for applause or some sort of approval. We just watched him silently until he gave me a wave. “See you, Axel.” He said with a wink.

He marched over to the door and halted. His hand wrapped around the handle but he just froze like a statue. We thought he was finally going to leave– an exciting prospect considering the shop would then be empty– but then he turned around with that grin even wider than before.

Smiles locked eyes with me and reached into his pocket. He started walking towards the front counter, passing it to where he could enter the bar area. From within his coat he produced a long dagger.

We’d broken a damn rule!

“Shit.” I managed before scrambling up onto the bar. Smiles got to our baked goods fridge and entered an area meant for employees only. Occasionally that rule would be enough to stop certain creatures but I was not so lucky. He slammed the knife down where my foot had been atop the bar, barely missing my shoe. 

Smiles wasted no time scaling the counter, chasing after me as I hurried around the shop. I entered the other lobby in a run, using the largest table as a shield between me and Smiles. He didn’t slow down, he just turned right and circled the table with infinite patience. We went around one another, spinning about the table, and Smiles had all the confidence of a hunter with a hare in a trap.  

It was hardly the first time something wanted to kill me but the pointed knife and the big grin put me into a panic I haven’t felt in years. I dashed backwards, throwing chairs aside to stop Smiles, hurrying back into the main lobby towards the front door. 

I didn’t see Tall Ben outside but rain made darkness thick outside. If I could get Smiles outside, I could double back and return. His violent intentions would halt him at the door! Tall Ben, however, was the most consistent hazard at the shop.

Risking worse things, I threw the door open and entered the cool, wet outside. 

Rain fell in sheets and masked whatever might’ve been hiding in the dark. I turned around to watch Smiles approach the door. He halted feet away from it. Grinning. Staring. Old, rusty knife stiff in his hand. 

I couldn’t go back in without him skewering me. I couldn’t stay outside without Tall Ben finally getting the one thing he always wanted; me, as a friend, and being a friend meant being squeezed and juiced into a jar for resale.

He wouldn’t be long. I had only anticipated being outside for a few seconds at most but it had been almost a minute already. No talisman, no protection in the dark, and fleeing wasn’t an option. Car or not, there was no safety outside the shop now that it was open. I *had* to get back inside!

I looked to my right. At our drive thru entrance, soaked in rain, sat the candle woman. Amber didn’t mind the pouring weather or the black. She stared at me, patiently waiting to see if I would come and check out what she had to offer. Amber *always* tried to beckon me over, to persuade me into talking to her. She hadn’t that morning, nor had she once I stepped outside. She knew something I did not.

She knew about Smiles.

Had she planned something?

I broke a rule. “Do you know what he is?!”

“What ever do you mean, Axel?”

He could hear her clearly over the storm. “The man inside! He has a knife and he’s going to kill me if I go back in.” I considered running away from him for the rest of the night but that would be exhausting. “Even if I get back in, he will just keep chasing me.”

Amber laid out her hands, displaying the tall candles she had on display. “Their light might seem dim, but I think if you bought one you might see a solution in the dark.” She looked over my shoulder and clapped. “Oh, goodie! Your friend is coming along.”

Tall Ben. I couldn’t see him in the dark but I believed her. “Amber, I am going to die if you don’t tell me. If I die, there is no more manager. No manager, no shop. No shop, no customers for you to harass!”

“Selene was the manager before you.” She snapped, her face turning sour. “There will be another.”

I looked back again. Tall Ben was peeking over a corner of the café but he wasn’t looking at me, not yet. “Amber, I–”

“–need to buy a candle.” She chided. “Buy one and I will tell you what that thing is and how to send him on his way.”

Again I looked back. There had to be another option! I didn’t know what buying a candle meant for me. Selene always stressed that it was the greatest rule. Immediate termination, no questions asked, which usually meant murder. I had to make a decision quickly. If I didn’t get back inside I was going to die. If I died, the shop wouldn’t close properly at dawn and that was bad for all his employees.

So I broke the most important rule of them all. “What does it cost?”

She picked one up, deciding which one was best for me. “I think you’ll find out. It is more fun that way.”

“Swear that, if I take one, you will tell me.”

She nodded, wiggling the candle. Things like her, like most of the creatures in the dark, are bound to their word. I just had to hope that a nod was enough. There was no time to argue, no time to play games with her, so I did what I never would have done were my old manager still in charge.

I took the candle.

“Oh, but we have to light it before you leave.”

“That wasn’t the deal.” I countered. “I have the candle and you agreed to tell me how to get rid of him!”

She lost her smile and, looking over my shoulder again, noted Tall Ben’s further curiosity. My fear was steadily growing; either go inside and inevitably be stabbed, or stay outside and by squished into meaty juice. 

“You know the old, classic vampire rule? They can’t enter unless they are invited in?”

I nodded vigorously. Why couldn’t Amber just spit it out?!

“Well, he’s the opposite. You’ve got to invite him to leave.”

What?! That made no sense! “Invite him to leave? How?!”

“Just tell him that he needs to leave and he will.”

I was certain that it wasn’t so simple. There is no way I broke the biggest rule over something so trivial. “And about him wanting to stab me? What about that?!”

“He can’t if you tell him to go. He can enter doorways, but he can’t leave them unless invited.”

I slammed the candle down on her desk and fled back towards the shop. Amber was laughing behind me, not a single care over the fact that I left what was mine behind. It didn’t matter, I knew that; I bought the candle and would soon discover why it was such a bad idea. I sprinted across the front of the store and that is where Tall Ben noticed me.

“What’s up my man!” He sounded like a normal person greeting a friend, but I knew far better. His form broke the shadow of the sky, stopping rain where he loomed. I did not know if he reached for me or not as I burst through the doors, leaping to the side when the reverse vampire– or whatever it was– lunged for me with the knife. 

He immediately tried another swipe.

“Leave! You have to leave!” I scrambled backwards. “Goobye, Axel!”

Telling him to leave and acknowledging the name he claimed caused Smiley to halt. “See you later, Axel!” He chimed and waved as he left. Tall Ben paid him no mind as he strolled off into the darkness at a stiff pace.

What the hell?! A reverse vampire makes no sense! What, was he going to put blood in me? Does he love garlic? I genuinely don’t even know how that could possibly work. 

Carlie hadn’t seen what I did, Amber was out of sight, but she had fetched a knife which she held in a four-fingered hand. “Is he gone for good?”

Our kitchen employee for the day arrived too. Jessie had a big, metal bowl held over her head. “And are you… you?”

“Yes, and yes.” I got to my feet, shaking. Despite all my time at the Drowsy Spectre, it wasn’t often I came that close to mundane death. Sure, it would be at the hands of the supernatural, but after everything a knife seemed a rather dull way to go. “He should be gone.”

“So we just had to ask it to leave the whole time?” Carlie threw up her arms. “That’s it?”

“I guess.” None of them read these stories. They wouldn’t know what I did outside and they don’t need to know. I had a bad feeling that things were going to go very poorly for me thanks to my purchase. Richard owns the place and I should probably reach out to him about it. I don’t know if he is familiar with Amber at all, or if he even knows our list of rules seeing as he never comes to the shop. I don’t have anyone else to ask about it. Can’t contact Selene– she’s gone. Some of my old coworkers that were here before I started might’ve known but I don’t even know if they are alive anymore.

Even if they are, there would be no way to contact them. It was different, riding it alone. Sure, I had employees to manage, but they didn’t know half of what was going on. Just six months ago Tall Ben managed to get someone out the drive thru window. A year ago, Lucas got taken by the Backdoor Thing. 

And I’d never admit it to them, but I know nearly as little as they do. Instinct made up most of my reality and it wasn't as if I had solid intuition, otherwise it wouldn’t have taken Amber’s help to figure out Smiley. 

I’ve always found trouble sleeping during the day– our night shifts require it– but it was even harder once I got home. The candle was sitting on my dresser, waiting to be lit. I passed it by and tried to keep my eyes shut tight. My very first day, years ago, I was told never to buy anything from Amber. Wasn’t even supposed to talk to her at all. Now the words of my predecessor haunted me. No, I am not afraid of being fired. It is worse than that. I know what the others don’t.

I know the threat of firing is a lie, and a mask to dissuade people from breaking rules which have consequences that are so much worse.
