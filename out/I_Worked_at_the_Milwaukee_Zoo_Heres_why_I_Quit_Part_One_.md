I used to work as a zookeeper at the Milwaukee Zoo. There wasn't much to it. Just your standard zoo with a gift shop and areas to visit certain animals. I certainly was a fan of the zoo as a child, having visited the zoo for birthdays or field trips. I always said I wanted to be a vet of some sort but guess zookeeper was the closest I could get. Started working at the place around age 20. Fresh out of high school and trying to save money for my autistic nephew, this job didn't offer much. Running the train when workers couldn't, making sure the animals were fed and taken care of, you get the gist. I know, I know. I said I was a zookeeper but work is right around these parts so I have to pitch in where I can. 

When I first started at the Milwaukee Zoo, I felt like I was living my dreams of helping animals. But that soon turned out to not be the case. After being there for less than a year, strange occurrences started to happen. It would be minor things such as lights going out, animals being sick, etc. Nothing major. The big incident happened right when two rookies were hired to see where they would fit in at the zoo. They were skinny and teen like. One was more hairer than the other but other than that, they seemed normal. Or so I would think. The weather was a bit hot and I was sweating while cleaning the elephant enclosure. I know, not the greatest job but someone's gotta do it. The manger of the zoo came up to me as I was closing the metal door to the cage. 

"You Emily Tanner?"

"Yes. What's up?"

"I've got these two rookie here and I was wondering if you have time to show them around the base, you know, kinda get them used to the place and see where they fit in."

"Um, sure." I stammered, reaching out to shake the two young mens' hands. The gesture was ignored. Thinking to myself, I wondered what was wrong with them. Did they not understand basic social cues? Were they autistic like my nephew? Thoughts started racing through my head until one of the young men spoke. 

"You ever notice the smell of animal waste, how it brings you joy?" 

I couldn't speak in that moment. Surely this guy was kidding around, right? Nope. His face was stone cold. He was serious. 

"Maybe." I managed to get out. This guy was *definitely* going be the last one to work with, I thought to myself. Instead, I gave a plastered smile and continued on with the conversation. 

"These two shouldn't give you a hard time." the manger said before walking away. I nodded in agreement but then he turned back around. 

"Oh, and I posted some rules on your locker door. Be sure to read them *carefully*. You wouldn't want to know what could happen to you if you don't." 

*"Is this man for real??"* I thought again, my breathing quickening. I was beyond confused. *"What is happening??"* 

But I couldn't worry about that. I had these two rookies to look after. Once I ensured the door to the elephant enclosure was secure, I lead the two men to the gorilla exhibit. It was a bit of a walk since the zoo is literally a maze where if you wanted to get to one area of interest, you had to pass several others before reaching your destination. Sure, you might be wondering if I should have the zoo's layout memorized by now, but you have to think. I don't go to the zoo everyday. Even when I go home, the zoo isn't the first thing on my mind. As I was walking, showing the men the different animals and how they behaved and such, I caught a chill down my spine every time I took a glance behind me to ensure they were following me. I tried to ignore it but the feeling was so overwhelming, I had to say or do something to take my mind off the dreaded feeling. 

"So, what brings you two to the zoo and why do you want to work here?" I asked them. 


Nothing. 



They didn't answer. They just stared. Their cold, black eyes stared right into my soul. I quickly turned away and continues down the hot sticky tar path towards the bird enclosure. Luckily for me, it was nearing my lunch break. I could probably feed some of the birds there and then leave these two to their own devices. 

I hurried my pace so that time could move faster and I could get as far away from these guys as possible. Hastily, I opened the door to the enclosure and lead them inside. Naturally the birds flew and here and there, their squawks and screeches following them as they flew about. 

"You wanna be careful with the birds. Sometimes they can be mean." I tried to crack a joke but these guys weren't having it. So I naturally shut my mouth and buried any jokes I had deep within. They just stared at me, their soulless eyes not leaving mine. Bleh! Where the manger pick these guys up from, the graveyard? Even mummies and buried corpses could crack a ghost smile every once in a while. Carrying on with showing them how to care for the birds, I checked my watch and quite literally ran out of the building like it was on fire. I had to know those rules and why on EARTH these deadpan guys were hired. Surely the manger wanted to hire them as a joke because no one could be *that* cold and  unfeeling like these two creeps. 

Racing to the locker/common room, I checked my locker door and surely, there was a list of rules. Five of them to be exact. 

Rule One. *Do not* allow new hires to see the animals. This is crucial. If you've broken this rule, it's already too late. 

Rule Two. Make sure the new hires are *not* left alone with the animals. 

Rule Three. Do not allow the new hires to come in contact with the people. This rule is to *never* be broken. 

Rule Four. Ensure *all* enclosures are locked and secure. 

Rule Five. If the new hires are ever left alone, run as far away from this place as you can. Don't look back.

Grabbing the note and slumping into a nearby nearly broken garden chair, I heaved a sigh. I guess I've broken most of these rules because I left these guys alone and I left them in the bird enclosure on top of that. These "rules" didn't make sense. Why didn't the manger warn me of these supposed rules *before* introducing me to these guys?? Sighing once more, I exited the room and went back into the blinding light outside. I hurried back to the bird enclosure to find the new hires gone. My heart sank. I had to find them and fast. 

Since I didn't know where to look, I went to the manager's office and found him on the phone. He sounded annoyed. 

"Yeah, yeah. I got them all set. The girl is to be in charge of them until I figure out something else." 

His word hit me. Surely he wasn't talking about *me*, right? My thoughts swirled again and I nearly gagged. Holding myself together, I knocked on the open door. The manger looked up me, plastering the fakest smile ever. 

"What brings you here?" he asked. 

"Um, I saw the note on my locker door and I think... I think I might have broken a few rules already." 

The manger quickly stood up and hurried to close the door shut. Looking out the blinds that faced the opening entrance to the zoo and gift shop, he turned to me, his face serious. 

"Did you lose them?"

"Huh?"

*"Did. You. Lose. Them?"*

His jaw clenched and his face was covered in cold sweat. 

"Yes." I finally admitted. The manger signed, hanging his head. 

"We have a problem." 

His words were cutthroat, no funny business hidden under his once funny demeanor. 

"What...problem?" I questioned, concerned. 

"Those new hires aren't... exactly what you would call human. They are entities of sorts."

Now my head was officially fried. *Entities*? I thought. What kind of twisty rollercoaster works was I living in?? The manger approached me. 

"If we don't find them by midnight, we're *toast*." he said, his voice a whispery hiss. I stared at him, shocked. 

"Well, what do you plan on doing? I-I didn't ask to be part of this!"

"Look, I didn't have a choice but to choose you. If I didn't..." he faded off. He then looked at me again, his features a mixture of hurt and panic. 

"If I didn't choose you, I would be taken away." he sighed, the words a heavy burden to say. 

My voice was no more. Still confused, I open my mouth to speak. 

"What do we do now?"

"We wait." 

End of Part One.
