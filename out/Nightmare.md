This one is true in the sense that it's a real nightmare that woke me up in a cold sweat just now, chock full of adrenaline. One of many unfortunately. Hopefully typing this one out will help me work through it enough to be comfortable trying to sleep again.

In this dream I recently lost a friend. He was big into nature and animals and I wasn't, but I tagged along for him I guess. One day while in a type of marsh/swampland, the boat took on water for whatever reason and we had to book it. I made it to shore, but he tripped over something in the water. Whatever it was he tripped over, it made short work of him and all I could do was listen in the dark.

After the passing of an undisclosed amount of time, I decided to go on a trip. I needed to escape from my own thoughts for a while. I'm driving through this snowy woodland area in the morning and I find myself skidding off the road and getting stuck. Frustrated with my circumstances and still depressed from survivor's guilt, I'm screaming my lungs out and decide to leave the car running for the heat until someone finds me. 

This next part doesn't make sense nature-wise, but dreams never really do, so stick with me.

 Evening arrives and I'm awoken by the sound of tapping on the glass. The car is practically dead now, so I don't even bother trying the windows. I get out of the vehicle to greet the stranger. In a real sinister tone of voice he mentions how it seems like I'm stuck out here all alone. 

At this time 2 other cars are driving past and pull up next to me, one on each side of my suv. These people look significantly younger, and almost seem like they're returning from a party or small get-together of sorts. 

The guy tells me "you're no fun", and asks who else did I call. I responded with a weakly, "everyone."

The new group gets out and start conversing among themselves and the first guy after speaking with me, trying to assess the situation and figure out how they could help. It's 3 guys and 1 girl, all looking like they could be college students.

 They're to the right of my car as I'm sitting in the passenger seat listening. My voice is gone from the yelling, and at this point I'm too drained to carry a conversation anyway.

I'm zoned out looking past the group, until the movement of something large behind their vehicle catches my attention. 

It's a bear.

I tried yelling but I have no voice. At this point it's noticed the group and is moving closer. I unlock the doors of my car and tried to tell "get in" but the words wouldn't come out. In a last ditch effort, I punched the guy immediately to my left and point at the bear, that was now full sprint coming from behind their vehicle. 

I scrambled over the console and into the driver's seat faintly screaming "get in" while one guy dives into the passenger seat, and another rushes into the back. The other 2 made their way to the car on the left of mine.

Unfortunately, the last guy was the farthest away, and promptly had a chunk of his throat bitten out, but was left there on the ground as the bear turned its attention to us. It began pulling on the door handles with its mouth and rocking the car with its weight.

After what felt like an hour of listening to the beast try and fail to get in, we climb into the back and try to wait it out. 

I woke up in the dead of night to see the creepy guy from earlier. Both of our backs are against the walls and we're facing each other, while the third guy lays between us also facing me. He put his finger to his mouth and whispered

"Shhh. It's back."

He pointed behind me, and I heard the sound of bones crunching and flesh being eaten right out of the door. But I couldn't move. I tried to scream but my voice was obliterated and all I could do was cry. I was terrified. It was so quiet that was the only thing I could hear. But that's not what scared me the most.

He was right to say that the bear came back. Standing on its back legs, paws on the glass, gazing into my soul with those black eyes looking right over his shoulder through the window. Still as a statue, not making a sound. Whatever was feasting behind me was a different threat entirely. 

And all I could do was listen in the dark.

This is the part where I woke up sweating with a racing heart.
