At the time, I was renting a studio apartment in a new building. Nothing seemed to foreshadow trouble. I lived alone, didn't have many guests, so I lived quietly and didn't bother anyone.

But at night, I was often distracted from sleep by strange noises, as if someone were scraping their fingernails on the radiators. But who knows what's going on in the minds of neighbors.

A bag rustling? Probably just the wind blowing it through a crack in the window. In general, there was an explanation for everything. In fact, I still consider it just a coincidence and nothing more. 

I've been tormented by nightmares my whole life, and I've experienced sleep paralysis a dozen times, so these phenomena don't surprise me. But I remember one of my nightmares for the rest of my life.

I went to sleep on my couch and dreamed that I was lying on my couch, and it was night outside the window. Then I heard a sound as if someone was opening the door with a key, and the door actually opened, and the light came on in the hallway. A girl came in (I had never seen her before in my life), but for some reason, when she came in, I felt so calm. She came up to me, said hello, and lay down next to me, and I lay there content, as if that was how it should be. She started hitting on me, but I turned her down because I hadn't forgotten that I was getting married in a couple of months. She immediately got up and started to leave, saying something about her cat and that she had lived here before me, but fell out of the window when she tried to catch the cat. 

She left, slamming the door loudly. So loudly that I woke up. I woke up from a strange feeling on my neck; my chain had slightly squeezed my neck. 

I heard the noise from the bag again, so close to the sofa, and thought I'd go and see what was there. I got up and looked at the floor. And there was my chain. I reached for it, but then I remembered that I was wearing it. I even checked with my hand to make sure everything was in place.

It turns out I wasn't awake, and I realized it in my dream. My body immediately stopped obeying me, and I fell headfirst from the sofa with my eyes open, face down on my chain. And I lay there with my head on my side. And my black cat was walking around the apartment, approaching the radiators, scratching them, chasing the bag.

I was so scared at that moment that I started yelling at the cat to go away.

And now I woke up for real. I woke up with wild screams throughout the apartment.

I couldn't fall asleep for a long time, but I finally did. In the morning, I woke up with a huge puddle of sweat on my chest and wet hair. My temperature had risen to 39.8. I was treated at home for two weeks with antibiotics and antipyretics. Nothing helped. And I felt like I was living my last days. I had already said goodbye to everyone in my mind. But I still called an ambulance. The doctors couldn't diagnose me for a week until they found that I had severe liver damage, very close to cirrhosis. 

But I don't drink. 

Two years have passed since then, and I still haven't recovered from my illness. Of course, I moved out of that apartment right away, because I had no money left due to my illness.

I am grateful to my parents for living nearby.
