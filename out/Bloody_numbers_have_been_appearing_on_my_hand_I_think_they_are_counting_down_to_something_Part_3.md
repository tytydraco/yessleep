The sun was starting to rise and I managed to stagger out of the park and onto the street. I had no idea what to do now. Were the doctors and those men in the hazmat suits still looking for me? Was I infectious? I considered the bleeding woman who had grabbed me and how since then the bloody mark was counting down to some uncertain event.

I had to figure out what was going on before it was too late. I decided to return home and tell Casandra the truth. She was likely worried sick and I honestly needed some help figuring out what to do next. Before heading back I stopped by a small store to get a handkerchief to cover my mouth and some gloves. I still did not know what this was or if it spread, but I did not want Cass to get sick in case it was transmissible.

I grabbed a taxi back home and staggered to the door, I was weirdly tired even after sleeping for almost an entire day. The fatigue was sudden and did not feel natural. Unfortunately due to the strange fugue I was in, I did not notice the vehicles parked outside Cassandra’s place until it was too late.

When Cass answered the door she nearly dropped her coffee. She rushed over to embrace me but I pulled back and held out a hand.

“Wait I think I am sick, I don’t know what is going on but I need help and things didn't go well at the doctors office.” I saw a troubled look on her face and something else that looked like it might be guilt.

“I know, I heard. Please listen, don’t run, there are people here to help you. They said they were the only ones that could now.”

I looked past her into the house and saw the men in hazmat suits waiting for me. Then I spun around and saw more on the lawn. I looked back to Cass and she had a pleading look on her face.

“Please, stay. Let them help, I am scared and don’t want to lose you.”

I considered running but when I saw her face and heard her plea I couldn't. I decided to stay and I held up my hands.

As the men approached me slowly I felt a strange heat underneath my skin again. My head started to pound and I swear I heard a chilling voice whisper to me.

“No.....”

Before I could stop myself I spun round and started to move away. Cass grabbed my hand and I instinctively pulled away, my nails scratching her hand in the process so badly I saw blood dripping from where I had torn free. She cried out and my fear and guilt had almost overridden the impulse to flee from the situation.

But I could not quell the overwhelming urge to run. I launched myself onto the yard and started sprinting away. I slipped past one of the men and another had something in his hand I had not noticed at first. It was a taser and he managed to aim and fire before I could get away. I fell to the ground, my body convulsing and the heat under my skin building to a breaking point.

As the others rushed over to my to subdue me I felt a tearing at my skin and suddenly a blood covered tendril whipped out of my hand and skewered one of the hazmat men through the faceplate and straight through his head.

The horrible crunch of broken bone and the sick tearing sound of mangled flesh broke me out of the primal urge to keep resisting and I felt like I was going to pass out again.

That concern was guaranteed when another shock followed by a poke in the arm with what was likely a tranquilizer, ensured my loss of consciousness.

I was not sure how much time had passed, but I woke up alone and cold, in a bright room with no doors or way out that I could find. I would have been able to see better if I had not been strapped to a gurney.

I could only see scant details in the room beyond my own body and a few angles of the surroundings, but I figured I had been isolated here for study. I saw my hand was wrapped in a restraining brace, but I saw from the angle that I could see, the shape of the bloody mark had changed yet again. The six had become a five and the fear and anxiety of what would happen at the end of the count pressed down on me again

I did not like that I was restrained, but I allowed myself to hope that maybe the people who had captured me would be able to help, if they couldn't I was not sure what I could do.

I heard a voice on an intercom in the room and a harsh static laden voice spoke to me.

“I am sorry we had to resort to restraining you, but it has become clear that your passenger is not willing to come quietly. I know you have many questions, but time is short. You deserve to know what is happening and I will tell you what I am allowed to disclose, but suffice to say we have around sixty hours to figure this out or something bad is going to happen to all of us.”

Passenger? I considered the implications and shuddered. I closed my eyes and tried to pretend that this was not happening. My fate was in the hands of whoever these people were and my time was running short. Something was going to happen and whatever that was was feeling more horrible every minute.
