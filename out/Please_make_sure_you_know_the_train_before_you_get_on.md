I don’t know if this is the right place to post, but if you’re reading this and you’ve taken the train to Blackpoint Terminal, stop now. Turn back. Forget this place exists.
Two months ago, I moved to the city for a fresh start. My apartment wasn’t much: peeling paint, a dripping faucet, and a window view of an alleyway dumpster. The only upside? The rent was dirt cheap, and it was close to the subway. The landlord warned me about the neighborhood, but I didn’t care. I just needed a place to disappear for a while.
That’s where it all began—with the subway.

I first noticed it during my nightly commutes. Every other night, around 11:03 p.m., an unlisted train would glide into the station. The announcements on the platform would cut out just before it arrived. No chime, no robotic voice. Just silence.

The train itself was…off. It had this muted, almost wrong shade of gray, like it had been bleached by decades underground. The windows were pitch-black, reflecting nothing, not even the station lights. Its sign always read “To Blackpoint Terminal”, a name that wasn’t on any city map.

At first, I thought it was a maintenance train or maybe an old line they hadn’t updated. But something about it unsettled me. No one else seemed to notice it—like, literally no one. Crowded platform or not, people never looked up when it pulled in. They just stood there, heads down, scrolling their phones.

Curiosity got the better of me. I decided to wait for it one night.

When it arrived, I stepped onto the platform as its doors slid open. A cold draft hit me, like I’d walked into a morgue. The interior was dimly lit by a flickering yellow light. The seats were all occupied, but the passengers…they weren’t right.

They were dressed in outdated clothes: tattered suits, worn dresses, some even in military uniforms that looked like they were from the 1940s. Their skin was pale, almost translucent, and their faces were slack, expressionless. They didn’t move, didn’t blink. Just sat there like mannequins.

Against all common sense, I stepped inside.

The doors shut behind me with a hiss, and the train lurched forward. My phone lost signal immediately. I wanted to turn back, but the doors wouldn’t open. The passengers turned to look at me all at once, heads swiveling like synchronized dolls.

And that’s when I noticed the smell.

It was the stench of decay, heavy and wet, like something rotting deep in the walls. I tried to avoid their gazes, focusing on the floor, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw one of them smile. Not a friendly smile—a too-wide, lip-splitting grin that revealed rows of needle-like teeth.

I stumbled back, trying to get away, but the train jolted to a stop.

When I looked up, we were at a station. But it wasn’t any station I’d ever seen. The walls were lined with rusted metal and graffiti in a language I couldn’t read. The air was thick with fog, and the platform was empty except for a single figure standing under a broken light.

It was a woman, or at least I think it was. Her face was obscured by a veil, and her hands were clasped in front of her. As the doors opened, she stepped inside and sat down without looking at me. The train began moving again.

I didn’t have the courage to speak to her, but she started humming. A low, haunting melody that echoed in the silent car. The other passengers began to sway to the rhythm, their heads lolling like puppets on strings.

The train stopped several more times, each station more unsettling than the last. One was submerged in water, fish swimming lazily past the windows. Another was filled with ash, where skeletal figures wandered aimlessly on the platform.

I don’t remember how long I was on that train. It felt like hours, maybe days. But eventually, we arrived at Blackpoint Terminal.

The station was vast, an underground cathedral with towering arches and an impossible number of tracks stretching into the void. The passengers shuffled off the train, one by one, disappearing into the shadows.

The woman in the veil turned to me as she stood. Her face—or what was left of it—was a mass of raw, seeping flesh, her eyes black pits that seemed to suck in the light.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” she said, her voice a chorus of whispers. “Now you belong to the Line.”

Her words echoed through the cavernous station, her black-pit eyes holding mine as if they could pull me into their depths. Then, as quickly as she had spoken, she turned and began walking toward the endless dark beyond the platform.

I wanted to move, to chase after her, to demand answers, but my legs felt like they were encased in cement. The air had grown heavier, colder. Somewhere in the distance, I heard a sound—like metal scraping against stone, slow and deliberate.

The train doors didn’t reopen. Instead, the windows began to fog over from the inside, obscuring my view of the station. Panic rose in my chest. The seats were empty now; the passengers had vanished, and the only sound was my own shallow breathing.

Then I saw it.

The fog on the window wasn’t random—it was forming shapes. Words.

GET OFF BEFORE IT LEAVES YOU.

A sharp hiss came from the far end of the train car. I turned toward the sound, and my blood ran cold.

Something was crawling down the aisle.

It moved on all fours, its limbs long and jointed at unnatural angles. Its skin was stretched too tightly over its frame, gray and mottled, and its head… its head wasn’t right. It was too large, the jaw hanging open in a slack, hungry gape, teeth jagged like shards of broken glass.

Its eyes were fixed on me.

I scrambled backward, slamming into the locked doors. My hands clawed at the controls, desperate to find a way out. The thing moved closer, the sound of its limbs dragging across the floor echoing in the silent car.

“Please,” I whispered, though I didn’t know who or what I was begging. “Please, let me off.”

The doors opened.

I fell backward onto the platform, gasping for air. My head hit the cold concrete, and for a moment, the world spun. When I sat up, the train was gone, the only sign it had been there a faint breeze that carried the stench of rot.

I was alone at Blackpoint Terminal.

The platform stretched on forever, a labyrinth of empty tracks and rusted benches. The fog that had hung in the air now clung to the ground, thick and suffocating. In the distance, I could still hear the sound of scraping metal. It was getting louder.

I forced myself to my feet, my legs trembling beneath me. I didn’t know where I was going, but I knew I couldn’t stay there. I started walking along the platform, every step echoing in the vast emptiness.

Then I saw it—a doorway, carved into the far wall. It was small, almost hidden, and flickering light spilled from within. I didn’t have a choice. I stepped inside.

The room was cramped, the walls lined with monitors showing grainy black-and-white footage of the subway. I recognized some of the stations—ones I’d passed through on the train. Others were unfamiliar, their platforms littered with bones or submerged in black water.

In the center of the room stood an old man. His back was to me, his hunched frame silhouetted by the glow of the screens. He was muttering to himself, his hands twitching as they hovered over a control panel.

“Excuse me,” I said, my voice barely a whisper.

He froze. Slowly, he turned to face me.

His eyes were gone, empty sockets staring through me, and his mouth twisted into a grimace. “You shouldn’t be here,” he rasped.

“Please,” I begged. “I just want to go home.”

He laughed then, a dry, hollow sound that made my skin crawl. “Home? You’re part of the Line now. There’s no going back.”

He turned back to the monitors, his hands moving across the controls. “But you can still serve a purpose,” he muttered.

Before I could ask what he meant, the floor beneath me shifted. The tiles cracked and crumbled, and I was falling.

I landed in darkness, the air knocked from my lungs. Above me, I could see the faint outline of the room, the old man staring down at me with that empty, unblinking gaze.

“Run,” he said.

The ground beneath me trembled. I turned and saw them—figures emerging from the shadows. They moved like the passengers on the train, their heads tilting unnaturally, their limbs jerking with every step.

They were smiling.

I ran.

The tunnel shifted and warped around me, and suddenly, I wasn’t in a tunnel anymore. I was in a maze of trains—endless cars stretching in every direction, stacked on top of one another like some twisted junkyard.

Each train was different. Some were rusted hulks with shattered windows. Others gleamed as if freshly polished, their doors yawning open. And from each car, I heard whispers—voices calling my name, promises of safety if I just stepped inside.

I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

The scraping sound was behind me, growing louder, closer. I turned a corner, only to find another row of trains blocking my path. Their lights flickered, casting long, jagged shadows that seemed to move on their own.

I ducked between two cars, my chest heaving as I forced myself forward. My legs felt like they were giving out, but the whispers and the scraping pushed me on.

Then, I saw it: a single door at the center of the maze. It didn’t belong to any train; it stood alone, glowing faintly in the dark.

I ran toward it, my heart pounding. The whispers turned to screams, the scraping a deafening roar. Shadows lunged at me from the sides, cold and clawing, but I didn’t stop. I reached the door and threw it open.

Blinding light engulfed me, and for a moment, I felt weightless. The screams, the scraping, the suffocating darkness—all of it fell away.

When I opened my eyes, I was standing in a field. The air was crisp, the sky an endless gray, and the horizon stretched on without end. But something was wrong. The ground beneath my feet wasn’t dirt or grass—it was cold metal, the twisted wreckage of train tracks crisscrossing in every direction, disappearing into the void.

I turned slowly, searching for any sign of the door I’d just passed through, but it was gone. Instead, there was only the maze.

The trains were here, stretching out as far as I could see, stacked high and leaning at impossible angles. Their lights flickered faintly in the distance like fireflies, but none of them moved.

I wasn’t alone.

Figures stood between the trains, barely visible in the dim light. They were passengers, I realized—the same hollow-eyed, slack-jawed people I’d seen on the train. But now they were watching me, their heads tilting in unison as I took a step back.

Behind me, the ground rumbled. I turned, and my stomach sank.

A new train was coming, gliding silently across the tracks. Its gray surface shimmered like a mirage, its windows pitch-black. The sign above it read:

“NO RETURN.”

I ran again, stumbling over the tangled tracks, my breath hitching as the figures began to move. They didn’t chase me outright, but they appeared in every direction I turned, stepping out from the shadows, blocking every path. Their whispers rose in a cacophony, speaking words I didn’t understand.

The train horn blared, low and mournful, vibrating through the air.

I tripped, landing hard on the cold metal. When I looked up, the train was right there, its doors sliding open with a hiss.

And standing inside was the woman in the veil.

She raised a hand, beckoning. Her voice echoed in my mind, not in words, but in feelings—an overwhelming sense of inevitability.

“You were never meant to leave,” she said.

I tried to crawl back, but the ground shifted beneath me, dragging me toward the train. I dug my fingers into the gaps between the tracks, screaming, but it was useless. The doors loomed closer, her silhouette framed in that sickly yellow light.

Just as the darkness began to close in again, something changed.

From somewhere far off in the maze, I heard a sound—a new train, this one blaring its horn with a sharp, ear-splitting pitch. Its lights cut through the shadows, brighter and more focused than anything I’d seen before. The passengers froze, their heads snapping toward the noise. Even the veiled woman turned, her hand faltering.

I didn’t think. I scrambled to my feet and ran toward the light, leaving her and the train behind.

As I reached the source, the ground beneath me gave way, and I fell—plunging headfirst into the blinding light.

When I woke up, I was back in my apartment.

The clock read 11:03 p.m.

At first, I thought it was over. I stayed off the subway, avoided the platform, and tried to convince myself it had all been a dream. But now, I know the truth.

The maze didn’t let me go.

I still hear the train horn in my sleep, distant but growing louder every night. The light in my apartment flickers at the same time the train used to arrive. And sometimes, just before I wake up, I see her standing in the corner of my room, her veil billowing in an unseen wind.

I don’t think I escaped.

I think the maze is waiting for me to come back.
