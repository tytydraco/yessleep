Help me. Please.

I’m a writer, okay? My stories aren’t real. I write fiction. At least, that’s what I thought.

In my last post on nosleep, I wrote about the witch of Pendle, and now I don’t think she’s something that I made up.

I’ve been hearing things that other people can’t hear. My family thinks I’m just messing with them to make my original story seem scarier. I’m not.

My grandma passed a few years ago, and I keep hearing her voice. She tells me to meet her in the Forest of Bowland.

I live in Manchester, which isn’t far from Pendle (the location of the famous witch trials). Today, I switched onto autopilot whilst I was driving to work and took an early exit off the motorway. When I regained my senses, I realised I’d set Barley as the destination on my GPS. That’s the village from my story.

Is the witch real? How did I know her story?

I searched Google for the names of the characters from my tale. Nothing came up. That relieved me. However, a few hours later, I received a message from someone who’d set their name as ‘Guest’ on Facebook.

I haven’t replied to him. I would dismiss the message as a Reddit user’s attempt to scare me, but he’s right. I am hearing and feeling things I can’t explain. I’m experiencing exactly what Thomas experienced in my story. Well, I suppose it’s not really my story at all. It’s real.

This is stupid, right? Maybe I just need more sleep. There could be rational explanations for the events that I’ve mentioned. Auditory hallucinations? Absent-mindedly typing Barley into my GPS? It’s possible. After all, nothing came up on Google about those missing Barley children. Nothing.

I want to believe that. Maybe you believe that. I wouldn’t blame you, but I don’t know what to tell you. I don’t feel tired. I feel wide awake. And I’ve been sleep-deprived before. This isn’t that.

The voice is real. The chill in the air is real. I think I’ve even see a tall shadow in the corner of my eye.

Honestly, I could rationalise all of that, but I can’t rationalise the feeling in my mind. With every passing day, my insatiable hunger for the forest continues to grow. It feels as if it could free me. I just need to see it. I just need to be there.

I don’t know how much longer I can resist the call of the forest. Whilst I’ve been typing, my grandma has been singing to me. Her disembodied voice doesn’t haunt me. It’s a sweet siren song that beckons me to visit the forest.

That’s what I find so petrifying about this whole experience. I don’t want to find the witch, but I have to find her. The hunger has consumed me. My self-preservation instinct is hanging by a thread. I don’t want to die, but I feel drawn to that house in the middle of the forest.

Even when I wrote the original story, my words didn’t capture this feeling. The urge. Wow. I can’t describe it.

It’s the call of the void, you know? An intrusive thought. The difference is that this void has made me its prisoner.

I wish, more than anything in the world, that I’d never posted Thomas’ story. I wish I’d never heard the call of the Pendle witch. Can anybody help me before I disappear into the forest and never return?
