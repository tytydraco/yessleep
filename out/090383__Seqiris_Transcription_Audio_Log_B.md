J.P: The date is the 9th of March, 1983 at 2:56PM.



J.P: After Johnson’s blundering performance this morning I have begun to question whether or not what we are trying to accomplish is even possible with the constraints of our current understanding of the technology. The science is promising but it seems even still with our adjustments to the formula, subjects are contuing to reject nerve instruction in often violent mannors - but push on we must.



J.P: I have had the lab assistants sterilise the cell and we will begin the next round of injections in T-minus 60 seconds.



J.P: Open to hatchet will you, my dearest Margaret…



\*The sound of a metal door being pried open can be heard as M.P. opens the door\*



J.P: Thank you dear…



J.P: Students! I know this is a very exciting time and I wanted to personally thank you all for offering your help in perfecting what will undoubtedly put an end to the Soviets and restore our status as the true international super power. For too long ha-



\*The sound of 3 sneezes can be heard emanating from patient number 6\*



J.P: For too long, have we accepted our place in the world… now, we forge it.



J.P: Please hold out your left arms and one of our nurses will administer the dose. When she has taped over the injection site, hold down on it applying firm pressure and no matter what you do… do not take any steps forward…



\*The sound of students wincing and grunting can be heard as the serum works it’s way through their systems\*



\*The sound of a metal door being pried open can be heard as J.P. and M.P. return to the viewing box\*



J.P: My god, Margaret!



\*The sound of a button being pushed is heard as J.P. uses the intercomm\*



J.P: Number 6! Remain in place. Do not take any further steps forward…



M.P: By the heavens… Jared it’s working…



\*The sound of screams can be heard as pandemonium erupts in the cell\*



J.P: Oh \*\*\*\* , not again. 



M.P: Jared! What is he doing? Jared, you need to stop this right now it looks like he’s trying to get out of his own sk-



\*The sound of screams can be heard as M.P. bawls her eyes out into J.P.’s chest\*



J.P: I’m sorry Mags, don’t look up just keep hugging me darling.



L.A: Mr. Patriski, your wife is no longer needed. Please remove her from the facility.



J.P: Please sir, just give her one more chance, she wasn’t prepared for th-



M.P: Jared you get me out of this filthy place right now I- I can’t see this no more… the way his shin popped out of his leg I- I can’t s-



\*The sound of sobbing can be heard as M.P. continues to cry in J.P.’s arms\*



L.A: Great work today Pat, this was step one. I need you scouring 6’s files for any indication of why it worked ASAP.



M.P: Yes sir, thank you sir.



\*The sound of a wooden door creeking open is heard as M.P. is escorted out by J.P.\*



L.A: Look at her… Beautiful…



\*The sound of Patient Number 6’s forehead banging against the observatory glass is heard as she repeatedly walks forward\*
