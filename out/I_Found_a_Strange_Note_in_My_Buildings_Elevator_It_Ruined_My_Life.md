“Do elevators dream when the doors close? Do they sleep between floors, remembering the people they've carried—or the ones they've taken?”

Strange thought, isn’t it? But after everything that’s happened, I’ve started wondering: What if elevators aren’t just machines? What if they’re passageways… and something *else* is riding them too?

I’m not writing this for attention. Hell, I don’t even know why I’m writing at all. Maybe I just need it out of me, like bleeding out poison. This story isn’t something I want to carry anymore. Maybe, by putting it into words, I can leave some of it behind.

So here it is. What happened to me. Word for word.

It started ordinary—don’t they all?

I’d just landed a new job. Pay was solid, hours manageable, and after years of cramped apartments and Craigslist roommates, I could finally afford a place of my own. Something clean. Modern. Uncomplicated.

Nova Tower looked like the future—floors of steel, glass, and silence. No creaky pipes, no cigarette-stained walls, no nosy neighbors. Just polished marble, scentless air, and that eerie kind of cleanliness that feels… *surgical*.

They advertised their AI-run systems like a badge of honor. Climate control, automatic blinds, smart lighting that matched your circadian rhythm. But what caught my eye was the elevator.

“No buttons,” the leasing agent had said, beaming like it was the cure for cancer. “Just step in, and it’ll detect your destination based on your movement patterns, facial recognition, and biometric signals.”

Sounded cool. Slick. Efficient. I didn’t think twice.

But now, I’d give anything to unstep into that place. To un-meet that elevator. To un-know what I know.

It was late. One of those wet, miserable Friday nights where the sky feels like it’s trying to crush you.

I was soaked to the bone—suit clinging, socks squishing in my shoes, a sheen of cold crawling down my spine. All I wanted was a hot shower and the mindless hum of late-night TV.

I nodded at the night concierge as I passed. He didn’t nod back.

Just stared. Eyes bloodshot. Jaw clenched. Hands gripping the counter like it was holding him down.

I hesitated. Only for a second. Then shook it off.

Whatever. Maybe he was having a bad night.

The elevator opened with a sound like a sigh—low and long, not quite mechanical. I stepped in, ready to zone out.

But something on the floor caught my eye. A slip of paper. Lying dead center in the middle of the floor, water-warped, ink bleeding at the edges.

I picked it up, expecting trash, maybe a lost grocery list.

Instead, I read it under the flickering light:

RULES FOR USING THE ELEVATOR AFTER 10 PM:

* Only ride to even-numbered floors.
* Do not speak, even if someone talks to you.
* If the elevator stops at Floor 13, do not exit. Close your eyes and wait.
* If the elevator asks you a question, do not answer.
* Leave immediately if someone steps in without a reflection.
* If your reflection is wrong, blink... until it looks normal again.

I snorted. “Urban legends in Helvetica.” 

I remember smiling. One of those weak, half-laughs you make when you’re alone and weirded out.

But something about the way it was written—the shaky handwriting, the way “do not exit” was underlined three times—made my skin crawl a little. 

I checked my watch. 10:07 PM. Maybe someone was just messing around. Cute prank. Halloween must’ve come early. Whatever.

Still, I folded the paper and slipped it into my jacket pocket. Some part of me—a smaller, quieter part—didn’t want to just toss it.

Not yet.

The doors slid shut. Smooth. Silent. The elevator started moving. Nothing happened.

I got off on Floor 12. My apartment. Warm light. White walls. Normal.

But now… I look back at that moment like it was the last time I stood on safe ground.

They say curiosity is a slow kind of death. Not sharp and quick—but a whisper, a tug, a splinter beneath the skin.

Three nights later, it whispered again.

It was almost midnight. I’d stayed late at work. 

The rain was back—angrier this time. Like the sky was trying to peel the city open.

The city outside was still soaked, streets gleaming like oil, air thick and heavy with that end-of-storm stillness.

I was tired. But also… curious.

You know that feeling when you *know* something’s a bad idea but your brain whispers, “Yeah, but what *if*?”

That’s what happened.

I stepped into the elevator. My apartment was on the 12th.But the thought crept in. What happens if I *don’t* follow the rule?

I said nothing out loud. Just stared at the black glass panel above the door.

15, I thought.

I wanted to see what was on the 15th. There was a rooftop lounge—supposedly gorgeous views. I hadn’t checked it out yet.

So, I stepped in. Waited.

The elevator accepted the command. No sound. Just movement.

It ascended like a ghost—no shudder, no gear sounds, just a rising emptiness in my stomach as the numbers ticked upward.

10… 12… 14… 15.

The doors opened.

And the rooftop lounge was gone.

Black. Not dim. Not poorly lit. *Black.*

The kind of black that has *depth*. That feels like it's breathing.

I stepped forward instinctively, as if testing if the floor still existed. The air was freezing. A cold that bypassed my skin and latched straight onto my bones.

“Hello?” I said.

My voice sounded wrong. Too loud. Too swallowed.

No answer. Just my own voice echoing back—flat and dead.

Then—*tap. tap. tap.* Footsteps. Deliberate. Soft. Slow.

Behind me.

I spun.

No one.

The sound stopped. The silence screamed.

Then—closer this time—*tap. tap. tap.*

My heart beat like a sledgehammer. I turned again.

Still nothing. But it felt like the dark itself had teeth.

I backed away, breath short. I could feel it—*eyes*. Watching. *Smiling.* Not with kindness.

I lunged for the elevator, slamming my hand against the inside wall like it was a lifeline.

The doors slid shut. The elevator dropped.

And that’s when I looked in the mirror.

My reflection wasn’t… right.

It looked like me. Wore my soaked coat. Had my nervous stance.

But the eyes were hollow. And the mouth—

The mouth smiled.

Not in joy. Not even in madness.

It was a knowing smile. Like it had seen what I hadn’t yet. Like it was *waiting* for me to catch up.

I blinked. And everything snapped back to normal.

The mirror showed *me*. Just me. Sweating. Pale. Shaking.

But that wasn’t relief—it was worse.

It meant something had *gotten in*.

When the doors opened to Floor 12, I didn’t walk—I ran. Keys trembling in my hand. Door slammed. Locks clicked.

Lights on. All of them. TV volume maxed just to fill the air with *anything*.

I didn’t sleep that night.

But that was only the beginning.

Days passed. But something had shifted in me.

I started avoiding the elevator like it owed me money. Took the stairs. Faked phone calls in the lobby. Made excuses to stay out late or leave early—whatever it took to avoid those smooth, whisper-quiet doors.

I tried to forget. Told myself I was sleep-deprived. Stressed. Seeing things.

But I kept the note like It was a trapdoor warning. I didn’t throw it away. I couldn’t. Something in me *knew* it wasn’t just paranoia. 

Because Nova Tower wasn’t built for paranoia. It was built for compliance. And climbing twelve flights of stairs every day starts to wear on you in a way that seeps into your muscles and makes you careless.

It was a Thursday night. Nearly 11 PM.I had my laptop in one hand, a coffee in the other.

I gave in again. Late shift. Rain again. Exhausted. My logic overpowered the fear: *It was just a glitch. A fluke. An overactive imagination.* Right?

The elevator sat in wait like a predator with a velvet grin.

I stepped in. The doors closed behind me like a secret being kept.

The usual synthetic voice came to life:

“Good evening, Liam.”

Polite. Crisp. Neutral.

“Evening,” I muttered back, half out of habit.

The elevator hummed softly. Began its ascent.

But then, halfway up, it *stopped*.

Not a gradual slowdown. Not the smooth deceleration I’d grown used to.

It *halted*. Hard. Like the air itself had seized.

The lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then dimmed to a dull, sickly yellow.

And the voice returned. But different this time.

Lower. Closer. *More human.*

“Liam…”

I felt the blood drain from my face.

The voice was almost *gentle*, like a lover waking you from a nightmare.

“Do you trust me?”

I didn’t answer. Couldn’t. My jaw locked tight, throat dry as dust.

The silence after the question was unbearable. Not quiet—*expectant*. Like something was *watching* and waiting. Leaning in. Breathing down my neck.

Then again, slower this time:

“Liam… do you trust me?”

The air thickened. My heartbeat thundered in my ears. I felt like I was shrinking inside my skin.

I wanted to scream, but all I could manage was a whisper:

“No.”

And everything went black.

I felt it before I heard it.

The sensation of *falling*. A sudden, violent drop, like the floor had just given up.

The lights died completely. The elevator screamed—a deep, metallic howl like it was being torn apart from the inside.

I crashed into the ceiling, then the floor, then the wall, tumbling weightless in all directions at once.

My hands clawed at cold steel. My knees slammed against the ground. My head struck something hard.

Still falling. Still falling. Still—

Suddenly, Silence.

The elevator shuddered. Stopped.

Then—*ding.*

The doors slid open like nothing had happened.

Floor 12.

Lights normal. Lobby music playing softly through the speakers like I hadn’t just stared into the throat of hell.

I crawled out. Couldn’t even stand.

My chest heaved. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I gagged, dry-heaving on the hallway floor.

I stumbled back to my apartment and didn’t come out for two days.

But After that night, I swore I’d never ride the elevator past 10 again.

I tried taking the stairs for a while. Twelve floors. Not fun. But better than being trapped in that steel coffin with a voice that *knew my name.*

At first, I thought I could just avoid it. Use it only during the day. Follow the rules. Stay safe.

But the building didn’t care. The rules? They weren’t safeguards. They were… *agreements*. You break them, even by accident, and something *not human* notices.

And it doesn’t forget.

Subtle things started shifting. My apartment door would be ajar when I came home, even though I *knew* I’d locked it.

The AI butler would glitch, calling me by the wrong name: “Hello, Mr. Anders,” it’d say.

But there *was* no Mr. Anders.

The neighbors started acting strange, too. I passed a woman on my floor—Mrs. Greene, I think. Nice old lady, always wore bright lipstick.

But her smile was off. Too wide. And she whispered, *“Going down, Liam?”* Just that.

Not *hi*. Not *good evening*. Just that.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t even breathe until I was back inside my apartment.

I started leaving all the lights on. Music playing constantly. Anything to drown out the silence.

But it kept seeping in. The building had a way of pressing against you. Like it was trying to get *into* you.

I wish I could say I learned my lesson.

But the tower... *it doesn’t let you forget*. The elevator started *showing up* in my dreams.

Always the same: doors opening onto a hallway that shouldn’t exist. Flickering lights. Peeling wallpaper. And something *standing* at the far end, unmoving. Watching.

Eventually, life forces you back into routine. Even nightmares can become familiar.

I convinced myself I’d follow the rules. Never speak. Never go to odd floors. Never answer questions.

One night, When I was exhausted, sleep-deprived and barely functioning. I told myself: Just use the elevator. Follow the rules. You’ll be fine.

So I did. I waited until 9:40 PM. Early enough, I thought.

I stepped in that night, alone. head down, mind blank.

“Floor twelve,” I said clearly. Just once.

The elevator obeyed. Began to rise.

The numbers blinked upward. 4… 6… 8…

Then something changed.

The panel flickered. Buzzed.

The numbers scrambled—8… 10… 12… 13.

No.

There’s no 13th floor. There *wasn’t supposed* to be a 13th floor. I stared in disbelief.

The elevator slowed. Stopped.

Ding.

The doors slid open.

What I saw… I still can’t fully explain.

The hallway stretched on forever. Walls the color of rot. Carpet worn to the threads. Water stains bleeding down the ceiling like veins.

And at the end—A figure.

Human-shaped. Completely still. Shrouded in shadows. Too far to see details, but close enough to *feel*.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

My instincts screamed, Shut your eyes. Shut them. Don’t look.

So I did. Tight. Every muscle locked.

The air changed. Grew heavy. Cold. Wet. Like fog creeping under my skin.

I whispered to myself, over and over:

“Close the doors. Please. Please close.”

The elevator groaned, like something ancient had to be convinced to move.

It felt like an eternity.

Finally—click.

The doors sealed shut, nearly catching my sleeve. The elevator rose. My eyes snapped open.

I didn’t see the figure again. But I *felt* it.

It’s like the thing on Floor 13 didn’t just see me…

It *knew* me.

Suddenly, the elevator took me to Floor 12, as if nothing had happened.

But my apartment door was already *open*.

And the lights inside? Already on.

I couldn’t go on like this.

I stopped sleeping. Stopped eating. Lost ten pounds in a week. My coworkers said I looked "hollow." I quit making excuses and started making plans.

Breaking the lease would cost me thousands. Didn’t care. I just wanted out.

I packed a bag. Grabbed the essentials. Left the rest.

It was past midnight when I headed for the lobby. The hallways were too quiet. Even the air felt tense, like the whole building was holding its breath.

I pressed the elevator call button with a shaking finger.

Ding. Doors opened.

Empty.

I stepped in.

As the doors began to close—

A hand slipped in.

The doors stopped.

A man stepped inside.

He was dressed too cleanly. Black suit, black tie, silver briefcase. No creases. No expression.

He gave me a nod. “Evening,” he said.

I nodded back, because *what else do you do*?

But something was wrong. Deeply, instinctively *wrong*.

The temperature dropped. A scent—coppery, like rust or old blood—drifted into the air.

And then I glanced at the mirrored wall.

He had no reflection.

None.

Just me. Standing alone. Even though he was two feet away.

My mouth dried up. My chest caved inward. My feet wouldn’t move.

Then he turned his head slowly toward me. Smiled. Just slightly.

“Going down?” he asked.

Not a question. Not really.

My body finally reacted. I launched myself through the doors just before they closed behind me.

They shut with a finality I felt in my spine.

I ran. Didn’t stop until I burst out into the cold, wet air of the city.

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t go home.

I didn’t even stop moving until my legs gave out three blocks away, and I collapsed on a bench, soaked in rain, heart still galloping like it was trying to escape my ribcage.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

A notification: “Nova Tower: Your elevator experience has been logged.”

I stared at the screen until the rain blurred the text. I powered the phone off. Never turned it back on again.

The next day, I checked into a cheap hotel—curtains that didn’t close right, sheets that smelled like burnt plastic—but at least there were *stairs*. Beautiful, terrible, leg-burning stairs. No elevators.

I tried sleeping. Couldn’t. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that hallway. The one that shouldn’t exist. The figure at the end. Waiting.

I heard footsteps in the silence. Felt eyes in every reflection. The city noise became a background hum, and all I could focus on was *not remembering*.

Didn’t work.

A week later, while drinking stale coffee and scrolling mindlessly through news apps, I saw the headline:

NOVA TOWER RESIDENTS REPORT STRANGE GLITCHES IN ELEVATOR SYSTEM – TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN ANNOUNCED

They called it “technical issues.” Said some residents experienced “floor misplacement,” “audio distortions,” and in one vague sentence, “non-physical presences.”

But no one used the word *haunted*.

No one said, *possessed*.

No one mentioned people stepping in and not stepping out.

Buried in the comments was a post from another resident:

“Did anyone else get that creepy note about rules after 10 PM?”

Someone replied:

“Yeah. Thought it was a prank. But my dog won’t go near the elevator anymore.”

And another:

“What’s on Floor 13?”

The post was deleted less than an hour later.

I still had the note. Crumpled. Damp. Stained at the edges like it had *bled* through the paper.

I flattened it out on the desk of my hotel room, smoothing it with shaking hands. Read it again.

Every rule made sense now.

Every warning was earned.

Every line wasn’t about control—it was about survival.

Only ride to even-numbered floors. Do not speak. Do not look. Do not answer. Leave if it has no reflection.

It wasn’t a game.

It was a contract.

And I’d broken it.

That night, I had the dream again.

But this time, I wasn’t in the elevator.

I was outside Nova Tower. Looking up.

The windows glowed red—every single one. Not warm light. Not fire. *Red*. Like the building had blood instead of wiring.

And from the top floor, something *watched* me.

Not with eyes. With intent.

Like it *knew* I was still alive. Like it wasn’t finished.

I woke up with tears on my face and the taste of metal in my mouth.

I moved three times in four months. Changed phones. Changed jobs. Told no one. Cut off everyone from that part of my life.

But it wasn’t over.

It never really is, is it?

Because about a week ago, in a building I’d never been in before, I pressed the call button for the elevator.

It arrived. Empty.

I stepped in. It started rising.

Then the voice came.

Soft. Familiar.

“Good evening, Liam.”

I froze. My vision blurred.

I hadn’t told the building my name.

I looked up. The display flickered.

12… 13… 13… 13…

And I realized something.

I never left.

Not really.

If you’ve listened this far, you’ve made a mistake.

You’ve *heard* the rules.

And the thing about the rules is—they’re like bait. The moment you know they exist, the moment they live in your brain, the game begins.

You might feel it already. That chill when you step into an elevator alone. That twitch when the lights flicker. That second glance in the mirror, just to make sure it’s still *you*.

It’s watching now.

The elevator.

Not just in Nova Tower.

Anywhere.

So, listen—If you find a note in your building with strange rules on it…

Don’t laugh. Don’t test it. And whatever you do...

Don’t get in after 10 PM.

Because once you know it’s out there, once you break a rule—even once— once the elevator knows your name—it remembers you.

It never forgets.

So next time you’re alone…

Next time you press a button, and the floor you land on isn’t quite right…

Next time you hear a voice ask:

“Do you trust me?”

Don’t answer.

Just *pray* the doors open again.
