It’s all I heard about for months. My schools Halloween dance. I couldn’t believe people wanted to go that bad. I was a little dumbfounded to say the least.

A little context. I live in a small town and we rarely if ever have anything going on. Even the homicide and crime rate is low. Nothing happens here. So it was a delight to many, when my school was opening a “all-town” dance. Anyone could attend and it was open from eight till midnight.
I was surprised alone with the time it would be open.

I didn’t want to go. I had better things to do on Halloween night. Like carve a pumpkin, make popcorn, watch horror films like Carrie or Prom Night, or Halloween. Why would I go to a lame dance when I could stay home and relax

But I’d be damned if all I heard for weeks was the same question.

“Are you going to the dance Michael?” My friends would say.

The same question, over and over. And I followed with the obvious.

“No.”

It was simple. And yet my annoying friends still asked me. I remember thinking to myself. God, was this dance really that big of an idea?

So time passes. Exams come through. Tests come through. My siblings costumes are made, and my dad goes to the video store to rent some horror films for me. And my mom made delicious pies for everyone. 

Then something came up. I was doing homework in my room, when my dad knocked, then let himself in. I looked up at him and he asked me.

“Hey so this is a slight warning. Your mother doesn’t want you to stay here all night and stuff your face with popcorn and watch horror movies. So she gave you two options. Either you take your sister Trick or Treating. Or you go to that school dance and we take her instead, you have until Monday to decide.”

He closed my door and left me to sit there, pondering. I was so pissed. I didn’t want to do either. Why couldn’t I just enjoy my time at home, but no. Instead I have to do two thing’s that I don’t want to do. 

I ended up choosing the ladder, the dance. It was better than taking my chatty sister around my town and walking up to every single damn home and having the possibility of having to use my knife.

And once I knew it, the time was here. It was Tuesday and Halloween. I had heard the streets were lined with fairy light and spider webs. My school had big, bright, neon lights shining through every window. And apparently downtown was full of dances, music, face-painting, and small Trunk or Treat areas.

Let’s just say I was a little flabbergasted.

I was at my home. My parents were decked out in The Shining costumes. My sister was some weird goth joker woman, and I. I was a killer. I was covered in blood. Most of it on my hands and face. I then grabbed my already torn shoes and my stained denim-jeans.

First stop, my school. They parked and I got out. I wished my parents good-luck and told them goodbye. I told my sister too, but she was more focused on fixing her costume. I smiled and walked into my school.

When I walked in. The immediate sound of old Halloween music went in my ears. It was so loud. I ended up finding my friends. My friends and I decided that if I was going to be a killer, then they were going to be my victims.

We had a good time for the first few hours. We all went early. We laughed, made jokes on everyones bad costumes and the awful music, and drank a lot of fruit punch. Time flew by extremely quick, even if they never could say a word.

And before I knew it, I saw my principal. Principal Henley, walk onto the gym stage and stand at a microphone. I didn’t know what was happening but I watched anyways.

“Testing, testing? No I’m just kidding” He said. Some listened. Some ignored. He continued anyways. 

“I wanna thank everyone who is here. And everyone who does to be here. Anyways, are you all ready to hear who the best killer and killed are?” He shouted. Now everyone was paying attention. Everyone shouted.

“Yes!”

The principal then smiles and a spotlight then flowed to me and my friends. Then it stopped. We had won. 

“Michaels table! Come up and get your metal for the best friend-group and duo costume!” He shouted. A large smile now on his face.
 
I was a little excited now. I had won. Unexpectedly. 

I got up from my chair and walked towards to the principal. 

But I then felt remorse, for my friends. They couldn’t see me win this. They couldn’t see my victory.

I looked back at them. I will say, their costumes were amazing. They way they were slumped over and their insides hanging out. So glad I chose to be the killer, this year.
