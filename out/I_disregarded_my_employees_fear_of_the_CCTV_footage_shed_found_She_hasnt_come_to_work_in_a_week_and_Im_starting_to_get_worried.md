I am the manager at one of the largest banks in my city. It's stressful  to take care of such a huge establishment, but I get the job done. Here’s a bit of background for the situation I’m in:
    
About two weeks ago, I received a call from the police in the middle of the night. There had been a robbery. Or, as I had learned once I’d driven to the establishment like a madman, an attempted robbery. Nothing was stolen thanks to our security guards, who’d chased the robbers off. But none of the three criminals were recognized. Witnesses described them, and pictures of each were drawn by professionals, but it wasn’t enough.

With the help of some security, we began to compile clips on the security cameras littered around the building. And boy did we find a lot. Not only was there footage of the criminals in the building, but their full faces could be seen multiple times. 
    
By last week the footage was ready to send over to the police. Justice would finally be served to those damned criminals. But before we could send anything, one of the security guards approached me. 
    
Marie, one of my quietest employees, who patrolled the inside bank’s perimeters during the nighttime. Despite having worked with me for almost 8 years now, she’d never approached me asking for help. That was until last Thursday, the day before when we were supposed to send the CCTV footage to the police. 
    
I received an email that day at around noon, while Marie wasn’t at work. She asked me to send her the footage, saying she just needed to ‘confirm a suspicion’, and I trusted her. I sent the final product, but that didn’t tame Marie. She asked again to see all of the footage. When I tried to ask why, she gave another vague excuse.
    
Despite her odd behavior, I sent the footage to her. She had a right to see it, she was on duty whilst the robbery happened after all. And Marie had never gone against us in the past, so why would she now?
    
I let myself forget about the conversation as I continued on responding to emails. I almost jumped out of my skin at the sound of my office door being pounded, about an hour later. 
    
“Marie, what are you doing here?” I asked, letting her stumble into the room.. “Your shift doesn’t start until 7(19:00). And you aren’t even in uniform!”
    
“I know James, I know. I just-” Marie slumped over in one of the chairs facing my desk, only continuing when I sat down as well. “The night of the robbery, right before the alarm was triggered, I saw something. I don’t know what it was, but I think it attacked and possessed me.”
    
What the hell was she on about? “I’m sure nothing like that happened to you, that’s impossible,” I thought my words over before I spoke. “Have you gone to a professional? Like a therapist, they could help you-”
    
“This isn’t made up, James!” Marie rose from her chair, pulling out her phone and swiping the screen furiously. “I asked you for the CCTV footage because I knew something was up. And look at what I found.”
    
True to her word, the clip was from the footage the night of the robbery. The camera recording was located in the corner of B Hall, the opposite side of the building where the robbery had taken place. I’d only skimmed through this recording before.
    
Marie was standing beside an office door, all alone on guard. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary so far. “Look, right here,” she pointed to the end of the hall. 
    
Something turned the corner, I couldn’t tell exactly what it was through the pixelated recording. The figure was black, but it seemed almost translucent. The robbers were wearing all black, but it couldn’t be one of them. Nobody was tall enough to almost hit their head on the 10 foot ceiling. It looked like a generic CGI demon straight out of a low-budget horror film.
    
Marie, who had been turned the other way, noticed the creature just then. She opened her mouth in what I can only assume was a scream as the demon raced straight towards her. Again, I couldn’t tell exactly what was happening due to the low quality.
    
But the demon was gone all of a sudden. And Marie was slumped over on the floor spazzing out. One of the alarms overhead began to shine red. The robbers had just broken in.
    
The clip ended and Marie took her phone back. “Do you believe me now?” She asked. “I don’t know what that thing was, but it must have possessed me. And it’s going to do it again. You have to investigate this, James!”
    
“I can’t launch an investigation on just a strange clip you found, Marie. This doesn’t prove anything. You were probably just imagining things. Like I said, you should seek professional help. Do you have a history with seizures?”
    
Marie stormed out of my office right then and there. I probably could have let her down more easily, but what else was I supposed to say? I work as a bank manager, not a ghostbuster. And that clip had probably been corrupted to some extent, which would explain the ‘demon’. Marie needed to get a hold of herself. 
    
That was just a couple of days ago. I haven’t seen her since. She hasn’t even called to say she wouldn’t be coming in. 
    
News of Marie’s disappearance has spread. Her face appears every time I turn on my phone. Did I upset her that much that she would just leave like this? Was a demon really possessing her? 
I’ve found the same clip from the footage, and I've been thinking of sending it to the police with the robbery footage. I don’t want them to think I’m crazy though; I have a reputation to sustain.
