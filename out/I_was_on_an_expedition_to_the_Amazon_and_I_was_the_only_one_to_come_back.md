Working in the jungles of the Amazon as PMC, I saw many things. Villages with little to no technology, giant snakes, beautiful, vibrant birds, creatures I had never even heard of before. I worked with a team of biologists, scouting a few kilometers of territory alongside the amazon river. There were five of us. These four biologists knew what they were doing, and each had several expeditions under their names. I had gotten to know them for a few weeks as they researched, I was there as protection against tribes, poachers, or anything that could be thought of. They had reasons to hire me, after all, they were extremely experienced in this line of work and knew where they needed help.

They hired me from Tungsten, a Private Military Company based out of Louisiana. I’d grown up there, and after my time in the army, I joined Tungsten. This was my first job, and as a solo job, it was going to be a tough one. I met the team, four young biologists with Harvard degrees and dreams to discover new species. Tom, Brooke, Pete, and Freddy greeted me and briefed me as soon as we met up at the airport in Brazil. They shook my hand, and eagerly explained what findings they hoped to achieve. This was their second expedition to the Amazon as a team of four, and for Tom, it was his fifth to the Amazon in total.

We landed on a dirt runway, aboard a converted C-47. The locals seemed interested in my modified rifle, with a laser, red dot sight, and suppressor. A truck shortly arrived to pick us up, and we sat in the bed for a two hour ride, which ended on a curve of the road, in the beginning of the forest. We got out, thanked the driver with a generous tip, and headed off. I had no idea what was going on, so I just followed them. They excitedly made their way into the jungle, pointing out species of trees and insects as we made our way through the dense foliage. The top of the rainforest covered most of the ground in dark shadows, leaving it looking like it was midnight, for months at a time. We made our way to a small clearing, and with a few slashes of a machete, the small bushes and sprouts were cut down, leaving room for our tents.

Brooke and Pete shared a tent, while Freddy and Tom used net covered hammocks. I used one as well, as the thought of a giant centipede crawling up my leg made me shudder. I kept a small Walther .22lr at my waist in case of such. As night fell and we grew tired, a large feeling of dread crept over me. Like I was being watched, by something that really didn’t me there. I had heard about explorers being torn apart by wild animals, so I sat up, chambered a round in my rifle, and waited.

“Wake up man, I’ve got breakfast for you.” I jolted awake, gripping my rifle, only to see Pete offering me a few strips of bacon. “Didn’t mean to scare you, that’s my bad man, but here’s some bacon. It’s not the best, but it’s what we’ve got.” I took the few strips I was handed, wolfed them down. I gave him a thank you for the breakfast, before standing up to take a piss. I walked 5 yards from the camp, and stared out into the jungle. My eyes were still blurred from sleep, but as they focused, I saw someone, something that gave me chills. It was a disembodied face, with spikes rising from the top of its head, a wicked grin, raised eyebrows, and squinted eyes. Its face was spherical in shape, and was lined by a thick mane of dirty fur. I blinked, and it turned around and barreled away. It had to have been at least 8 feet tall, with its muscled body covered in mud and wounds.

I took a few steps into camp, where I met the others. “I swear I just saw some giant… thing! It was tall, with horns, and a fucked up smile. Wha-” 

“Woah man, calm down, breathe,” spoke Tom. “When you’re in the jungle, you see things. You get used to them. But sometimes, they aren’t friendly. Why do you think you’re here?” The rest nodded in agreement.

I stood there in disbelief. There’s no way that they were so acceptant of the fact that a fucking monster out of a horror movie was stalking us, and that I was supposed to be cool with that too. 

“How are you guys okay with this? I’m just one guy, what if it gets me? Then who will protect you?” I shouted at them.

“Oh don’t worry, that won’t happen.” Tom said with a smile.

As the day went on, the group left in pairs, telling me to stay with the other two that remained at the camp. I kept my rifle on fire at all times, as I was scared shitless of that monster that lurked in the jungle. As night began to fall for the second day, I crawled into my hammock with my rifle in my lap, and I kept a cup to piss in just in case I had to go. I wasn’t getting out in the middle of the night. As I started to get drowsy, I heard what sounded like whispering. I peeked over the side to see the group of four standing around the fire, holding hands, whispering. Things weren’t seeming so normal anymore, not that they had for the entirety of this ordeal. 

As I sat there wondering what to do, I started to lose consciousness. When I awoke, I was near a creek bed, as the four stood over me, all smiling just like the monster. My arms and legs were tied down, and Tom wielded a knife. They had cut my shirt off, and I can only assume were ready to carve into me and do whatever sick shit they had planned, but they failed to tie my left hand as tight as my right, and fortunately for me, they didn’t notice my pistol at my waist. A plan came to my mind, all I had to do was wait.

“You sick motherfuckers! You gonna kill? For what?” I yelled.

“Well, you’ve already seen Kazte-Ka. Just know that your sacrifice will be very welcomed by him, and we are pleased to deliver your heart to him. In fact-”

“Shut up with the cheesy lines Tom, just get it over with.” I interrupted. 

“Well, if you say so.” The four said at once.

They began to pray in unison, words I couldn’t understand, as Tom raised his knife. As he looked up at the knife, holding it with both hands, I reached for my pistol, and fired. He fell to the ground holding his neck, blood spraying out. I opened fire at the other three, firing wildly at them. .22lr isn’t as the 5.56 Hollow Points I had loaded in my rifle, So I put as many rounds into them as I could. Pete fell down holding his chest, while Freddy stumbled into the bushes behind him. Brooke tried to find the knife, but I loaded another magazine and dispatched her. I aimed at Freddy, fueled by rage, and pulled the trigger. I felt unexpectedly good at that moment, and the jungle fell silent for the first time since I had arrived.

I caught my breath, and made my way up the small incline to the camp. We weren’t far off the road so I knew it wouldn't be a long walk. I grabbed my radio and my rifle, and set off. As I neared the road, I heard loud thumps behind me, and I started running, knowing that the beast was coming. Before I knew it, it reached me and knocked me on my ass. I turned around to try to fire at it, but my shots missed as it grabbed my leg and thundered back into the jungle, dragging me along. After what seemed like miles, it threw me against a tree. As I stared up at the jungle ceiling, I saw light peeking through, realizing that the sun was rising.

My vision blurred and I heard its manic breathing and grunts as it slammed its fist onto my chest several times. I laid there unable to move, as I watched it disappear back into the jungle. Soon, I felt insects crawling over me, even the centipedes I was so fearful of. Sometimes they took a bite, running away when I screamed in pain. As night began to set, I heard footsteps. I looked, and out of the corner of my eye, I saw Brazilian soldiers coming to me with water. 

Now, as I sit in my wheelchair at my home in an undisclosed location, I see the Kazte-Ka sometimes. I’ll see it in my dreams, out in the fields, or sometimes in my home. Never moving, only staring, whispering t

he same chants the four biologists whispered as they prepared to kill me. Maybe after I recover, I’ll head back. And maybe, I’ll bring a few friends, to give to Kazte-Ka.
