I don't know why fate decided I was the one to discover the truth to reality, maybe there was something about me that made me a good messenger, I never have been able to fit in with others, always a little. different, but than again, maybe that was the reason I stumbled upon the truth in the first place.. Nevertheless, I suppose it was for the best, if I can help free humanity from ourselves then I suppose it'll all be worth it in the end, so here's my story.
My name is Zenix Grayson and let me take you back to where it all started

A few years back, when I was an 18 year old senior prepping for the adult world I had other hobbies I liked to pursue aside from the occasional gym visit & video games. I also liked to meditate. You may be thinking; "umm what's so special about meditating???" And admittedly you'd be right to think so, living with anxiety and depression, meditation was often my way to bring myself back to reality, but unbeknownst to me, meditation would bring me to other realities. My sessions were honestly normal for the first 6 years or so, (and yes I began meditating at 12) I'd lay on my back, close my eyes, focus on my breathing as much as possible for about 30 minutes to an hour and that was that. Many times l'd go the rest of my day with a peaceful aura around me.
However, my sessions took a drastic turn one afternoon. I decided to meditate after coming home from school, I began my usual routine when all of the sudden I felt vibrations all over my body, it's difficult to describe really, it felt tingly, almost ticklish and electrical in a way. I tried to fight against it and perhaps get up but I was completely paralyzed. My heart began racing, whether caused by the experience or my fear I don't know, but terror swept across my entire being when suddenly, someone, or perhaps... something instructed me to relax, and so l did. I completely surrendered to the feeling and as I did, I began seeing flashing lights despite my closed eyelids, and my body became numb. almost unable to feel it at all as the world as I knew it faded away, and I slipped into a black void. 

"Where the fuck am I?" | wondered, all around me was an
encompassing darkness, I tried to feel my way around but realized I had no hands or arms to move, l attempted to move forward but realized I had no legs or feet either. I was total consciousness floating in a sea of dark nothingness. Suddenly, from the darkness I saw a faint light. It was white, but seemed to have a pink aura around it as it approached me, or perhaps my wonder caused me to start approaching it..? Either way, as soon as I got close to the being I began to also wonder if I myself was an orb of light? Knowing my luck, I probably wasn’t as beautiful to look at… anyways, how do I explain what I felt next? I guess I’ll just rush right into it like I do with most of my problems. Radiating from this being was a love beyond imagination, totally unconditional, free of judgment and euphoric. I almost began weeping from joy (if that were possible) when suddenly I received a message in my head; “Prepare yourself, your life is about to change”… “what the fuck?”, I thought. An amusing smile came from the being when suddenly I exited the void almost as fast as I arrived. Quickly, my “body”? Zoomed backwards as I saw the distance between myself and the entity grow further and further and as the distance grew further so did the love I felt.. & suddenly, I awoke.
