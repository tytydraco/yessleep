I trust myself too much.

People have been telling others to trust their gut instinct for as long as I can remember. There have even been many instances where people have correctly predicted future events, like a mom catching her baby after “foreseeing” it would roll off the couch.

Even as someone who’s gut instinct has been proven wrong multiple times (like guessing the wrong answer on a test, etc.), I’ve always held the belief that my sixth sense must hold some correctness at some point. I believed it. I trusted it though I doubted it, and even if it was wrong before.

Up until a week ago.

I switched off the light and climbed into my bed. The clock on the nightstand read 1:30am, and I slid under my covers, eager to get some sleep after a long day. After settling in, my thoughts drifted and my eyes closed.

*YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT.*

I jolted back to reality from my half-consciousness. The air turned eerie and thick - breathing became difficult and I laid there, overcome with fear. I started sweating and my stomach protested. My sixth sense’s prediction was irrational, of course - it told me I was going to die tonight, and that someone was going to walk into my room and stab me to death. 14 times total. I forced myself to breathe and came to the rationale that my mind was just making things up. Nobody was going to die - besides, this prediction was suspiciously specific. I lifted my head and stared into the dimly lit hallway outside my room, listening intently. Though I couldn’t look down the hallway from my angle, I was certain that I would hear footsteps if anyone was walking towards my room. I didn’t hear anything after listening for a minute. This was definitely a false warning.

It wasn’t easy, but I eventually slept. This feeling in my gut was strong, like it was trying to force me to believe. I told myself it would be crazy to believe.

*YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT. YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT. YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT.*

Every night became increasingly restless. The feeling was stronger every time I didn’t listen, and it always took over my mind just before I fell asleep. Each time I awoke with an impending sense of doom, petrified that some being will walk through the bedroom door with a knife in hand.

I developed a new set of daily rituals. Before I slept, I triple checked all locks around the house, turned on all the lights like it would ward off evil, and locked my bedroom door. I hoped this would give me some sense of security, but it did little to get rid of this gut instinct. I was starting to believe it too much. I couldn’t convince myself that it wasn’t real. Sleepless nights stretched on and I stared at the door for hours on end, waiting for something to happen. For the doorknob to rattle. For the banging on the door. For the sound of footsteps walking down the hallway. Just for something to happen.

Three days passed and I still hadn’t slept. I felt like I was losing my mind. My face turned pale and the bags under my eyes had deepened. During the day, sleep came in increments. Apparently, the feeling only came if I tried to sleep during the night. Co-workers started looking at me with concern. If this goes on, I wasn’t sure I would be able to continue on with work.

I no longer felt safe in my home, so I called Maya, my sister, in the afternoon just after I had forced myself to stomach my lunch. I told her I wanted to spend a few nights at her place since we had not seen each other for so long. It was half true - I had been busy with work for the past few months and had little time to keep in touch. Maya was very open to the idea and mentioned how it was like the good old days when I would visit her college dorm.

Arriving at her house, I was happier to see her than I thought I would be. She was a familiar face that I could always depend on. Tears were forced back and I smiled, embracing her. I know she saw that something in me had changed, but it seemed like she didn’t want to push. I was grateful - I wasn’t ready to look crazy in front of her, and was planning on telling her once I had settled in. I hoped this change in scenery would help for the better.

I really hoped.

Time passed too fast. The uncertainty of whether my six sense’s warning would show up or not was weighing on my mind. I spent the day with Maya. We talked. We ate. I laughed for the first time in a long time. Maybe getting out of secluding myself was what I needed.

Before I knew it, it was past midnight, and I was feeling tired. The last thing I wanted to feel. I was sitting in the guest bedroom across from my sister’s, scrolling through my phone though my eyes started to feel heavier and heavier. Maybe today was finally the day I would finally get some rest. I held onto this moment of fleeting optimism.

I went to brush my teeth. It felt weird to deviate from my routine of triple checking the locks and bolting my door shut, but at the same time I was glad I would no longer need to take these precautions.

Adjusting the blankets in the darkness, I turned to my side, letting my eyes close. I had never felt so tired in my life. Hesitantly, I drifted off to sleep.

A few seconds after I lost consciousness, it was back.

*YOU WILL DIE TONIGHT.*

I was forced awake again.

Feeling more devastated than anything, I finally let my tears fall. I asked myself why I even bothered trying anymore. It was merciless no matter where I was, or who I was with. As always, I sat up in my bed, wrapping my arms around my knees, and started straight ahead of me through the doorway and into Maya’s room. I couldn’t see her from the doorway but I could see the clock on her nightstand, which read 2:23am. My eyes involuntarily closed but the impending sense of doom multiplied. Fear of death kept my eyes open.

I don’t know how long I stared. It must’ve been at least a few hours, and my eyes were unfocused.

But I saw something move. A figure moving into view from behind the doorframe of Maya’s room. I started to panic, but as it moved into the hallway light, Maya’s face materialized. Seems like she got up to use the bathroom.

She jumped the moment she saw me. I couldn’t blame her, I must’ve looked like a ghost.

“Are you ok?” She asked.

I nodded, and though she seemed skeptical, she turned and walked down to the hall towards the bathroom.

Her vacancy revealed something else. A huge, black mass, swirling until it grew and manifested into a tall humanoid figure.

It had come for me. As it turned out, my sixth sense was wrong. In fact, it was way off the mark - this was far from a human that had come to stab me to death.

Blood drained from my face. I could feel it staring at me, and I couldn’t help but stare back. It darted towards me fast. I let out a guttural scream as loud as my throat allowed, and covered my head with my hands, tears streaming from my eyes which seemed to be stuck open. I don’t want to die.

A few seconds passed and I looked up. It was gone. I broke down and sobbed into my knees.

Maya ran into the room and turned on the lights. The bed sank as she sat and quietly consoled me. I looked up and met her face, written with confusion and sympathy. I sunk into her arms for a while, but deep down I wasn’t convinced it was really gone. It must be hiding somewhere for me, waiting for me to be alone for it takes my life.

Pushing myself off of Maya, I first looked around the room, then searched around the house. Maya followed closely behind, trying to get me to open up about what happened. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t see anything behind the house.

When the adrenaline died down, I realized that my sixth sense had gone with it. The gut instinct that kept me up every night, telling me I was going to die. A newfound sense of calmness washed over me, and with it all the exhaustion that I accumulated over the past few days. I went back into the guest bedroom and collapsed.

I woke up late in the afternoon, and Maya told me I slept so long she thought I died. Laughing at her joke, I ate her leftovers from lunch, thinking that I might as well have died. She looked at me with a certain expression, one that prompted me to answer why I broke down last night. I waved it off and said I had a bad nightmare and a panic attack.

Since then, I have moved back into my house and am living my best life. Except it follows me everywhere I go. I see it in the shadows, and in the corners. Its stare pierces through my back. Sleeping is difficult, but not as impossible as before. I’m trying to live with it now. I have a feeling this thing is going to be with me for a very long time, haunting me to the ends of the earth.

So, heed this warning. Please don’t trust yourself too much. Like me, you will start hallucinating some weird creature and lose sleep over something so pointless. No matter what your sixth sense tells you, please resist with all of your might. Don’t believe.

Or, you can keep trusting yourself. Just know that if you roll off your couch, there may be nobody there to save you.
