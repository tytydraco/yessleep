I was desperate to find a job. I had just finished my contract as a waitress at a pub in my hometown, one of those that only lasts during the most profitable summer seasons.

I needed to pay the tuition fees for my final year of veterinary school, but my savings wouldn't help much. I didn't want to ask my mother for money either; she needed it much more than I did. I had just two weeks left to start paying, or else I'd have to say goodbye to my dream job... when I was so close to achieving it.

I spent Sunday morning and part of the afternoon visiting job search websites and applications, sending my resume to any company or place where I might have a chance. Not wanting to leave any stone unturned, I also checked the job demand sections of the Sunday newspaper. I can't explain how surprised I was when I noticed one ad in particular:

*Responsible person wanted to care for a horse for seven days. Interested parties should call XXXXXXX. Ask for Margareth White.*

I had done horse riding until shortly before starting university, and I had helped my grandparents care for their horses when I was a child. I was convinced I had enough experience for such a job, so I didn't think twice. The phone rang three times before an elderly woman's voice answered.

It was Mrs. White herself. When I told her I was contacting her because of her ad in the newspaper, she asked me to tell her everything I knew about horses and how to care for them. I explained my experience with them and that thanks to my studies, I knew how to diagnose certain diseases and administer first aid if needed.

Mrs. White seemed delighted when I finished. But she said that before she could hire me, I had to go to her house, which was in an isolated corner of a valley, so she could see for herself how I handled Loch, her horse. Her nephew would come to pick me up the following Monday and take me there. I

f she was satisfied with me, I would start working from that very day since she had to leave for the capital in the morning. I wasn't thrilled about spending a week in the house of complete strangers, especially in the middle of nowhere, but I needed the money, so I agreed.

On Monday morning, I waited with my suitcase at the designated place where Carl, Mrs. White's nephew, picked me up at the agreed time. The house was an hour's drive from the town, but Carl wasn't very talkative, so I spent almost the entire trip listening to the radio and looking at the English countryside landscapes.

The only thing I remember from the trip is the news warning that Edward Simmons, known as the Trail Killer, had struck again. This time, his victims were a couple of hikers found with their bodies covered in stab wounds in a forest not far from my town. I shivered, hoping they would catch that psychopath soon.

Later, we ventured onto a dirt road that didn't seem very traveled, and at that moment, I began to have doubts about whether it was a good idea to accept this job. Carl had warned me that there was barely any signal at his aunt's house and no internet connection; she didn't even watch television, and the nearest neighbors were a twenty-minute walk away.

The only connection to civilization was that dirt road, the living room radio, and the kitchen phone. I couldn't help but wonder how long it would take for authorities or an ambulance to reach such a remote place if needed.

I thought about my final year of school, my dream of becoming a veterinarian and opening my own clinic. The salary Mrs. White mentioned would more than cover my tuition fees, which surprised me since the job would only last seven days, but I suppose her horse's well-being was very important to her.

Although I didn't have a pet at the moment, I understood it; my love for animals was what led me to study veterinary medicine. I also thought about my mother and how much she regretted not having enough money to pay for everything I needed. I didn't want to worry her any more, so if I had to spend seven days disconnected from the world to get the money, I would.

It didn't take long to reach our destination. The house was traditional, pure English rural style. It looked like something out of a postcard or a period series. A few meters away was what I deduced to be the stable, also traditional in style with a large wooden enclosure surrounding it.

Beyond the fence, I glimpsed a splendid black horse. He was huge and very beautiful, with long, wavy mane hanging from his thick and robust neck. His coat shone like a lake at night, a sign that he was healthy and well cared for.

Mrs. White came out of the house with a broad smile as soon as I got out of the car. She was the spitting image of an adorable grandmother, with white hair styled in a sixties fashion and a green sweater embroidered with birds and flowers. When she approached, I saw that she had even carefully applied makeup. She greeted me enthusiastically while Carl stepped away to light a cigarette.

"You have no idea how glad I am that you've come, dear Ann. I'm going to London for a week for a family reunion, and poor Loch has no one to take care of him. And Carl doesn't like being around him much. "

I didn't judge him; although I love them, I understand that for some people, horses can be intimidating, especially if they're as large as Loch. Mrs. White led me to the enclosure where the animal rested, and he came towards us as soon as she called him.

"This is Ann; be good to her," she said while stroking his muzzle.

The imposing equine turned towards me, and as if he understood his owner's words, he extended his head so I could pet him. The lady smiled contentedly and then proceeded to show me the stable, where she kept the grooming tools and his saddle.

I spent the next two hours brushing the horse's coat, cleaning his hooves, and riding him within the enclosure. Loch was the most obedient and calm horse I had ever ridden. His movements seemed to anticipate my thoughts; I barely had to move the reins or my heels for him to do what I asked. If they hired me, the next seven days would be the easiest and most pleasant job of my life.

After unsaddling Loch, Mrs. White announced that I was hired. What joy, I could finally pay my tuition and continue my studies! She then led me to her house and offered Carl and me a cup of tea. I noticed that along with mine, she left a rather long note and indicated that I should read it.

*"When you go riding with Loch, if you pass by a lake or river and he stares at it for a long time, say his name and turn back the way you came.”*

*"After the ride, remove his tack and let him loose all night. Do not put him in the stable.”*

*"When the sun sets, close all doors and windows on the ground floor, or he will peek inside.”*

*"Avoid going outside at night as much as you can. Loch gets very nervous during those hours. If he sees you, stay still and say his name. Let him sniff you until he is satisfied. Once he leaves, if you are outside, walk slowly back to the house. Do not run. If you are inside the house, walk slowly to the door and close it tightly.”*

*"In the morning, put him in the stable, give him his ration of hay, clean any dirt or stains from his body, and let him rest until noon. Then you can let him out to the enclosure.”*

*"It is unlikely, but if you find a dead animal at the house entrance in the morning, pick it up and throw it into the basement furnace."*

I couldn't help but raise an eyebrow at what I had just read. What were these strange rules? Was Loch so precious to his owner that she had made such a quaint list? Besides, I couldn't help but think about the rule that specified letting him loose at night. Wasn't there a danger of him getting lost or being attacked by a wild animal? But as if she had read my mind, Mrs. White answered my questions with a smile.

"Don't worry about Loch; he knows how to take care of himself. Just follow the instructions on this paper, and everything will be fine."

"You better listen to my aunt, girl," Carl murmured suddenly with a grim look.

Mrs. White and her nephew left two hours later, leaving only Loch and me in that God-forsaken place. I settled my things and clothes in the guest room and waited until 6 o'clock to saddle Loch. We galloped around the area for the rest of the afternoon, passing through the forest and trails.

The horse obeyed me without barely touching the reins. It was a magnificent experience until a river crossed our path. Loch suddenly stopped dead and stood still like a statue, ears pointed towards the water. I pressed my heels against his sides, but he didn't move; nor did he when I pulled the reins.

As the minutes passed, his breathing became heavier, as if he was about to bolt. He continued staring at the river. I began to worry; was he afraid of the water? Then I remembered the list of rules; there was one for when this situation occurred.

"Loch," I whispered while stroking his neck.

The horse trembled for a moment and made a deep, guttural sound. If it weren't impossible, I would have sworn he had just growled. I needed to get him away from the water as soon as possible. I pulled one of the reins to make him turn around, and for a second, I thought his eyes had changed. They were no longer chestnut but black, so black they seemed to have no pupils. How was that possible?

*I must have imagined it*, I told myself as we left the river behind.

We returned to the house just before nightfall. As one of the rules required, I removed Loch's tack and let him loose in the enclosure, which, by the way, had an entrance to the forest. As for myself, I made sure to securely shut all the doors and windows on the ground floor.

Though I must admit, I did this more out of unease being alone in such a desolate place than out of concern that the horse might poke his head inside the house. In fact, if he did, it would probably look adorable. I might even take a photo with my phone to send to my friends back at university.

As night fell, the hours passed uneventfully. Occasionally, the sound of Loch's hooves galloping would break the silence, but it didn't bother me. Mrs. White had assured me that the land surrounding the house were her property, with clearly marked boundaries, so her horse had plenty of kilometers to run freely throughout the night.

With that in mind, I settled into my room and spent a couple of hours reading some veterinary science books I had brought with me. Since I had no internet or television to distract me, I figured I could brush up on some topics for upcoming classes. Satisfied, I eventually went to sleep, still hearing the distant thunder of Loch's wild gallop in the surrounding area.

During the next two days, everything went smoothly. In the mornings, I had plenty of time to myself—listening to the radio, reading a book, or talking on the phone with a friend or my mother. She wasn't entirely comfortable with me being away for so many days, but she was reassured when I described how beautiful the experience was, not to mention the generous salary I would receive.

It wasn't until my fourth day of work when things started to get strange. In the morning, when I went out to brush Loch, I found a dead squirrel in front of the door. It had wounds all over its body, and blood splattered its fur; clearly, something had killed it but hadn't eaten it. Perhaps the animal that caught it got scared when it heard Loch and dropped it. Regardless, I couldn't leave it there.

Following the rules, I took it to the basement and threw it into the boiler. I would have preferred to bury it—more dignified and wouldn't fill the room with the smell of burnt hair and flesh—but if that rule existed, it must have been for a good reason, no matter how quaint it seemed.

Hours later, another strange episode unfolded. It was nearing dusk, and I was watching Loch graze from one of the windows, holding a cup of hot milk, when suddenly a deer emerged from the forest, leaping into view. It froze upon seeing Loch, who fixed his gaze on it, equally motionless with ears pricked. It was a perfect moment to capture, so I quickly grabbed my phone to take a photo.

But just as I had barely activated the camera, Loch bolted towards the deer, swift as an arrow, and both vanished into the thick of the woods. Though initially struck by their behavior, I remembered the rule list mentioning Loch getting nervous at night; besides, some horses could become aggressive when defending their territory. I didn't dwell on it and went to bed a while later.

The next morning, after having breakfast, I went to check on Loch. I found him waiting at the stable entrance; he looked exhausted but otherwise seemed fine. However, as I approached him, my heart sank. A large patch of fresh blood covered Loch's front, from his mouth to his chest.

My first thought was that some animal had attacked him, perhaps a deer that had rammed him with its antlers for getting too close. But I couldn't waste time speculating; I needed to clean his wounds and tend to him as best as I could.

I hurried to lead Loch into the stable and fetched a large bucket of warm water along with some cloths. With delicate care, I began cleaning the horse's skin, ensuring every trace of blood was removed. Yet, I found no wounds on his skin or in his mouth.

"What on earth...?" I muttered aloud.

Loch rubbed his head against me as if to reassure me. Then, I noticed a strange, repugnant odor, like decaying flesh. But that couldn't be right; horses are herbivores. The stench must have been from the blood accumulated in the bucket water and cloths... Yes, that had to be it.

I placed a mound of hay in Loch's manger, and he immediately began eating eagerly. His appetite reassured me; if he could eat with such gusto, his mouth must be fine. He showed no signs of pain when I gently palpated his chest and neck for hidden wounds or bruises. At a glance, he seemed as healthy and strong as ever.

I spent the rest of the morning in the stable, keeping a close watch on him, but he showed no signs of illness. He didn't limp or appear listless. But then, where had all that blood come from? Could he have collided with an injured wild animal while galloping during the night? That seemed to be the only reasonable explanation I could think of. Though unlikely, it wasn't impossible, so eventually, I convinced myself that must have been what happened.

Loch continued to behave as usual when 6 o'clock rolled around, so I saw no reason not to take him on our usual walk. He trotted me through the labyrinth of trees surrounding the house until we came across the corpse of a deer.

It bore a striking resemblance to the one that had appeared in front of the house the day before, but this one lay on the ground in pieces, some of its organs scattered around and its throat torn apart. What kind of creature could have done this? There hadn't been bears or wolves in Britain for many years, and it was impossible for a fox to do something like this.

A shiver ran down my spine just imagining the size of the creature that had killed that poor deer. How large and sharp its teeth must have been...

I sensed we weren't safe in that place, so I pulled Loch's reins to turn him back. But as he turned, I noticed he was sticking out his huge tongue and licking his lips from side to side. Was he licking his chops?

Upon returning to the house, I wasn't sure about leaving Loch loose for the night. What if whatever was roaming the woods attacked him too? I decided to lock him in the stable; it would be pointless to follow the rules if the horse ended up dead. And so the rest of the day passed until nightfall. When darkness fully set in, I heard Loch neighing loudly from the stable. He was probably furious about not being able to run freely as he usually did at that hour, but I couldn't risk putting him in danger.

Over time, his neighs became deeper and hoarser, almost sounding like roars. Worried, I took a flashlight and headed toward the stable to calm him down. A rabbit stared back at me as I pointed the light at it, but I paid it no mind. As I approached, Loch sounded less and less like a horse.

As soon as I lifted the board that kept the gate closed, something rushed out of the stable like a hurricane, pushing the wood forcefully and knocking me over as well. Distracted by the pain shooting through my back from the fall, it took me a moment to register the moist, viscous sounds just a few steps away from me.

Confused, I grabbed the flashlight and aimed it toward the source of the noise. All I saw was Loch's hindquarters, swaying slightly as he greedily chewed on something.

"You really do love the taste of dew-covered grass," I said irritably. "But now you need to..."

My words caught in my throat as the beam of my flashlight illuminated what was under the horse's muzzle. It was the rabbit from earlier, its fur soaked in blood and its entrails exposed.

"What... the hell?!"

Loch's eyes were no longer brown or black but milky white. There were no pupils, yet somehow I knew he was staring at me. They weren't even in the same position as before; instead of being on either side of his head, they were now at the front, like a predator's eyes. And his mouth... dear God, it wasn't the mouth of a normal animal anymore. Instead of lips, there were now rows of bloodied, large, razor-sharp teeth, displayed in a grin that resembled a sinister smile.

This couldn't be real; it had to be a nightmare! Loch was a good horse, not the bloodthirsty monster before me. I wanted to scream, to run away as far as I could from him. I had to bolt and hide in the house. I was about to do just that when I remembered the list of rules again.

"L... Loch," I managed to murmur, my throat choked with panic.

The horse's ears twitched at the sound of his name. He moved his head a couple of times, emitting a guttural sound, before approaching me. I stood as still as a rock, letting the creature press his fleshless muzzle against my arm, then my shoulder, my leg, and finally my forehead.

The stench of rotting flesh from his breath overwhelmed my nose and mouth, but I fought hard not to vomit. If I did, I would move, and who knew what would happen then. After what felt like an eternity, Loch seemed satisfied and turned away. He took what remained of the dead rabbit in his jaws and disappeared into the darkness. Once I heard his steps fade far enough, I walked back to the house and barricaded all the doors. I didn't dare to sleep for the remainder of the night.

When dawn came, I called Mrs. White. It took her a while to respond, but she didn't sound the least bit concerned when I told her what had happened to me during the night.

"Didn't I tell you to follow the rules, dear? Loch doesn't like being locked up at night, let alone seeing people during those hours."

"Is this a joke?! Haven't you heard what I said? He had fangs, his eyes were white...! He tore apart a rabbit and ate it!"

"Oh yes, he loves doing that at night. He must have been very hungry, poor thing."

"Mrs. White, I don't understand how you can be so calm... What if he had attacked me?"

"Did you stay still?"

"Yes, but..."

"And did you say his name?"

"Yes..."

"Then there's nothing to fear, dear. Follow the rules I gave you and everything will be fine. If you feel safer, I'll give you my neighbor Paul's phone number so you can call him in case of emergency. How does that sound? Or... would you prefer to go back home?"

I was on the verge of saying yes to the last question. I would rather be without a career than without a neck... right? Well, if I thought about it calmly, there were only three days left until my contract expired. Once Mrs. White returned, she would pay me the money I needed to cover my tuition. Three days, now knowing that a killer horse prowled at night, but three days nevertheless.

"That sounds good, Mrs. White."

The old woman seemed satisfied with my response and hung up. In the afternoon, it took me a while to put the bit on Loch when I went to saddle him, because I remembered the row of sharp fangs that had been there the previous night and would reappear in a few hours.

But Loch had shown no intention of harming me so far, because he followed the rules. If I kept it up, I wouldn't give him reasons to attack me, and that thought gave me the courage to put my fingers in his mouth and encourage him to accept the iron piece. That's how the rest of the day went, just like the days that followed.

In the afternoons, I rode Loch around the surroundings, avoiding getting too close to the river or lakes. At night, I let him run free to unleash the beast within him, and in the mornings, I cleaned any traces of blood from his coat. He was gentle with me, even affectionate, which made me more cautious around him, given that he had once seemed interested in devouring me. I responded with brief pats on his neck and carried on with my tasks, trying to finish as quickly as possible to minimize my time near him.

During the morning of the last day, another dead animal appeared at the entrance, this time a hare. Like before, I took it and threw it into the basement boiler's fire. This made me think that perhaps Loch was the one leaving his prey at the house. That would explain why there was a rule about it, but why was he doing it? I knew that sometimes cats and dogs brought their owners animals they caught as a gift. Was this Loch's way of thanking me for taking care of him?

“Of course, he thought about killing me and now he's saying thank you. Very logical of you, Ann”, I scolded myself.

Night fell again, the last one I would spend in that desolate valley; or rather, in the hunting grounds of that murderous horse. As usual, I closed all the doors and windows; but instead of sitting down to read or listen to the radio, I decided to go to sleep. I just wanted it to all be over and return to my peaceful life in the village. The sound of Loch's hooves pounding the ground was the last thing I heard before succumbing to sleep.

I woke up sometime later, but it was still dark outside. My clock read 4 in the morning; I had never been awake so early. I was about to go back to sleep when a piercing scream shattered the silence of the night. At first, I thought it might be Loch, perhaps hunting or marking his territory; but a second scream made me realize it wasn't any animal, not even a monster—it sounded very human.

Had an unsuspecting hiker wandered into Mrs. White's property and encountered Loch? If so, that person was in serious danger. I had to do something! If I played by the rules, I could go to their aid without the horse attacking me. I grabbed my boots, my coat, and the flashlight, and headed outside. There was no sign of Loch anywhere.

"Hello?! Can you hear me?! I'm coming to help!" I shouted as loudly as I could. As I stepped out of the house, suddenly a figure emerged from among the trees. In the light of my flashlight, I saw it was a man around forty years old, disheveled and wearing dirty clothes. One of his arms was stained with red. Loch had attacked him.

"Stay where you are, I'm coming now," I advised him, trying to sound as calm as possible.

I made a move to approach, but the stranger locked his gaze onto me, sending a strange shiver down my spine. His eyes reflected fear, but also something more disturbing. I lowered the flashlight and discovered, with horror, that in his uninjured hand he held a large, bloodied knife.

The news of Edward Simmons, the Path Killer, who had last attacked not far from my town, flashed through my mind. I shuddered in terror; I would have preferred to encounter Loch. At least with him, I knew what to expect. The man started walking towards me, gripping his weapon tighter.

"Get inside the house," he muttered hoarsely.

My feet dared not move. I was frozen by confusion and fear.

"Come on, get in already! Before that beast..."

A powerful roar echoed through the forest. I never thought I would be so relieved to hear it. If I stayed still, nothing would happen to me. The killer swiftly turned towards the trees, trembling like a leaf in the wind.

"I stabbed it with the knife and he's still alive," he murmured anxiously. "How the hell is that possible?"

Swift as a snake, he grabbed me forcefully by the neck and pushed me inside the house. He slammed the door shut and cornered me against the wall at knife-point. Edward was breathing heavily, and the blood from his wound splattered the floor. I could sense his desperation, and something told me that a madman like him in that state was worse than the most dangerous of monsters.

"How can I avoid that thing?" he asked me.

"You can't. You'll have to wait here until dawn. Then he'll calm down."

"Don't fuck with me, bitch! The police are hot on my trail; I can't risk staying here much longer."

"It's the only way. If you move, he'll attack you."

The criminal lowered his head and muttered some words I couldn't quite catch. Suddenly, he looked at me again with his crazed eyes and grabbed my arm.

"It can't focus on two prey at the same time, can it?" he asked with a smile that chilled my blood.

Before I could reply, a sharp pain tore through my stomach. Instinctively, I glanced down and saw the knife lodged in my abdomen.

"No, no..."

A torrent of blood spilled at my feet with a dull thud as the wretch withdrew the weapon from my body. The pain was unbearable, beyond any words to describe. My legs gave way and I fell to my knees. Edward grabbed me by the collar of my coat and swung open the door. Loch was already outside, just a few steps from the entrance. He roared upon seeing us.

"Here's your dinner, horsey!" Edward yelled as he violently threw me towards Loch.

The door slammed shut, leaving me at the mercy of the horse. I lay on my back as best I could, clutching where I had been stabbed. Blood continued to slide down my skin without cease. Whatever happened next, I had no chance. I closed my eyes and let tears of pain and helplessness flow. I heard Loch approaching until I could feel the tip of his hoof against my head. His warm, putrid breath enveloped me as he nuzzled my body. Soon, he reached my stomach wound.

"Loch..." I murmured with the little strength I had left. "Please, no..."

Another couple of thick tears escaped me. If I were to die, I preferred to remember Loch as the gentle horse with whom I spent countless hours riding through the forest, not as a monster tearing my flesh with his fangs. I felt something warm and wet on the wound. It was Loch, licking me. Was he testing the blood before starting to eat me? But that dreaded bite did not come. Instead, he pulled away from the blood and gave me another gentle lick on the forehead.

At that moment, I heard footsteps receding from behind the house. The horse lifted his head and pointed his ears in that direction. His toothy smile widened even more, and with a terrifying growl, he trotted off towards the edge of the forest.

As soon as he left, an intense heat emanated from the wound and began spreading throughout my body. It felt like fire coursing through my veins, burning me and making my head feel like it would explode. I wanted to scream, but I couldn't. It didn't take long before I lost consciousness.

The first thing I heard upon waking up was a familiar female voice. I opened my eyes. I was in my room at Mrs. White's house. She was standing beside the bed, smiling with relief to see that I had woken up.

"Thank God, dear! Carl and I arrived just a few hours ago, and when we saw you lying on the floor, I feared the worst. I'm so glad you're okay."

I struggled to sit up on the mattress and touched my stomach. Then I remembered the wound inflicted by Edward and looked in horror at my belly. But there was nothing there anymore. The only evidence of being stabbed was torn and blood-stained clothing where the knife had entered.

"What... what happened to me? The Trail Killer came here and attacked me. He stabbed me..."

"Oh... that explains a lot."

Confused, I turned to the elderly woman, and she returned a smile.

"Loch took care of that undesirable. There was a lot of blood at the edge of the forest behind the house. We followed the trail and found what was left of him. He must have been a terrible person, so much so that Loch didn't even eat a piece of him; he just tore him apart as much as he could. He didn't have a pleasant death, I can assure you. Carl is in town now, reporting to the police. They'll conclude that he was killed by a wild animal, case closed."

"But the wound..."

"Loch is a box of surprises, my dear. He may seem terrifying at first, but when you get to know him well and follow his rules, he's the most loyal animal you can imagine."

Mrs. White explained to me that Loch had been in her family for countless generations, dating back to the time of the Celts. Apparently, their oldest ancestor had made a deal with him. They would care for him and let him be 'himself' during the nights; in return, the horse would protect them and refrain from causing harm, as long as they followed certain rules.

"The fact that Loch left prey at your doorstep means he considers you part of the family. Since he became mine, no one has achieved that. I must congratulate you, dear. He likes you."

Mrs. White gently stroked my head and let me rest for the remainder of the day. The next morning, I had the breakfast she prepared and felt strong enough to leave the bed. I found Mrs. White outside, cleaning Loch's nostrils. On the white cloth, I noticed familiar red stains. Nothing related to that animal could surprise me anymore. He softly neighed when he saw me and trotted over. He offered his muzzle to my hand. His breath stank of blood and decay, but I didn't mind. I affectionately stroked his forehead.

"Thank you so much, Loch."
