I… I’m… I don’t even know where to start. I’m definitely in shock right now. Deirdre saved us again, but not before the Dullahan nearly killed me when I wouldn’t let it get to Dana.

I’m sorry if this post is a bit scattered due to the shock. I’ll try my best to explain everything somewhat clearly.

Since the white car has not returned since my last post, Dana and I decided to take Deirdre for a walk earlier today. We were walking past the front gate when we heard Simon, one of the gate guards, call us over to the gate guard booth.

“Hey girls! I have something to show you. I already showed this to the police during the investigation the other night, but I thought you’d want to see it too since you were in the house.”

Simon pulled up the security camera footage of the front gate from the night when the white car appeared and started to go through it.

“Girls, the other gate guards and I are so sorry that this happened to your family. We have no idea how this attacker got into the neighborhood. All we’ve been able to find is this clip of footage here.”

Simon pressed play. I looked at the time stamp and it read a few minutes before 2 am on the night the car appeared. The gates suddenly opened, then closed after the standard thirty seconds. The problem is that there was no car or person anywhere in the footage. Either the gates opened and closed by themselves due to a malfunction, or whatever opened the gate couldn’t or didn’t want to be caught on camera.

Dana and I thanked Simon and took Deirdre home. There was no doubt about it now. This thing was not human.

When we got back to the house, Aunt Kathy told us that she had set up some security cameras facing the driveway and the street in hopes of possibly catching whatever this thing was on camera.

Before we went to bed, I decided to try something with Deirdre. I wanted to see if u/ThordurAxnes and I were both right about what Deirdre might be. I had been practicing the pronunciation for a few things I wanted to ask her. I know some might think I’m slightly off for asking a dog questions, but as we’ve already established, Deirdre is definitely not a normal dog.

Once I found her in the living room getting ready to go to sleep, I just decided to ask.

“Deirdre, an bhfuil tú madra agus Cú Sidhe?” If I got the translation correct, I asked her if she was a dog and a Cú Sidhe.

My jaw dropped when she nodded at me. She actually nodded. It wasn’t a coincidental head movement. She made direct eye contact with me and gave me a firm nod.

After a moment I managed to get my voice back and asked another question. “An féidir leat sinn a chosaint?” I wasn’t sure if I had said that correctly, but I had tried to ask her if she could protect us.

To my surprise she not only nodded again, but came up to me and pressed her forehead very gently against mine with a look in her eyes that said she would do everything she could to keep us safe.

After double checking to make sure every door and window was locked even though it probably wouldn’t do anything, Dana and I went to bed.

A few hours later I suddenly jolted awake. I soon realized why. Our bedroom door was open.

Dana wasn’t there. 

I instantly jumped out of bed and started running through the house trying to find her. Dana hadn’t had a sleepwalking episode in years. Why did it have to happen now?!

As I made my way to the front of the house, my heart nearly stopped.

The front door was open.

Not even thinking about my own safety and trusting Deirdre to protect Mom and Aunt Kathy, I ran out the door into the yard and saw something that practically made my blood freeze in my veins.

The white sports car was back. The driver was slowly climbing out of the car.

This creature was easily the most terrifying thing I have ever seen. It looked like the skeleton of a huge man, but the bones were pitch black. Its jaw was open in what I assumed was a grin. The eye sockets of its skull were filled with a dark orange glow that occasionally had tiny flames lick the outer edges of the sockets. In its left hand it held what looked like a human spine.

My sister was sleepwalking straight towards this monster.

I didn’t even think. I was not going to let this monster kill my sister. I started running towards the skeleton.

“DANA! WAKE UP! NOW!”

Dana’s eyes snapped open and she screamed when she saw the terrifying creature reaching for her.

“DIVE LEFT! NOW, DANA!”

She tried, but she wasn’t going to make it. I lunged forward and tackled her out of the way. The creature grabbed me instead.

I quickly grabbed the wrist bones of the creature’s right hand which was wrapped around my throat. It wasn’t choking me. Yet. It dragged me forward until we were face to face.

“Wh-what are y-you?!”

The skeleton threw back its head and laughed.

“I am a Dullahan, girl. I want death. I have decided to take it from someone in this house. That pathetic little gate guard wasn’t nearly enough. What was his name? Simon? Pathetic. He didn’t even put up a good fight. His spine did make a lovely replacement for my old whip, however.”

I have never been more frightened in my life. This thing killed Simon by ripping out his spine. What was it going to do to me?

I heard Dana get up behind me and try to run to the house for help, but the monster lashed out with its spine whip. I heard Dana scream and fall to the ground.

“You know, I was originally going to take her. Sleepwalkers are easy since the dreamworld is between life and death. However, you seem much more interesting. I think I’ll take you instead.”

The Dullahan suddenly lifted me off the ground and started squeezing. It was like an iron band was wrapped around my neck. I couldn’t breathe. The creature was laughing as it stared into my eyes. Instead of uselessly struggling, I used the last of my air to call Deirdre. I hoped she would hear me because all I could manage was a quiet rasp.

“Deirdre, contúirt!”

As my vision started fading, I heard a massive roar that actually shook the ground and then the sound of glass shattering. The Dullahan’s hand suddenly jerked and it let out that horrific shriek as it threw me to the side. I blacked out as soon as I hit the ground.

The next thing I knew I was waking up with Deirdre licking my face. I tried to sit up and speak, but someone gently pushed me back down. I then heard my Mom’s voice.

“Shh, Luna. Stay still. You were badly hurt. Don’t try to speak. The Dullahan is gone. Deirdre chased it off and she is not hurt. You’re in an ambulance right outside the house. Dana is right next to you and she is alright. The cut on her back from the whip was shallow and will only need a few stitches. Kathy is outside talking to the police and showing them the security camera footage and audio recordings. They caught everything. We are so sorry we didn’t believe you, sweetie. Deirdre has made it very clear that she will not be separated from you girls. You will be safe here. I have to go give my statement to the police. I love both of you so much. Just rest now and then we’ll figure out what to do.”

As Mom left the ambulance, I turned to my sister. She was lying on her stomach with the back of her shirt ripped open from a nasty looking gash.

“Luna, don’t worry, I’m alright. That thing almost crushed your throat and it left a huge black handprint bruise on you, so please listen to Mom and don’t talk right now. Thank you for saving me. This creature is clearly too dangerous for just Deirdre as amazing as she is.” I nodded and then we both tried to rest as the ambulance took us to the hospital.

All of this happened very early Saturday morning. Dana and I are currently in the hospital resting after our treatment. The Dullahan’s whip ripped Dana’s back open from her right shoulder to her left hip, but it only went through the very top layers of skin. She needed some skin glue and a few stitches where the slash was deeper due to the shape of Simon’s vertebrae, but she’ll heal in a few weeks and she won’t have a scar.

My throat wasn’t damaged too badly, but due to the swelling from the massive hand shaped black bruise, I won’t be able to speak for several days and swallowing will be painful for a while.

I know I should be resting, but I wanted all of you to know that we’re all still alive. 

I’m going to try to rest, but first I have to message u/need_a_nightlight. This Dullahan is not something that Deirdre can handle by herself since she isn’t a full blooded Cú Sidhe.

We need an exterminator.
