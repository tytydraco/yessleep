For the purpose of this story, and to keep anomality, the name is R. I’ve been working with a local hiking trail as a volunteer to guide folks around a set of trails that are some of the prettier sides of the south in the state of Georgia where I’ve grown up most of my life. I’m not really a nature person, and being outside in Georgia in the south during the summer is killer. If you aren’t prepared, heatstroke and bugs are notoriously awful during the summer. Almost every other billboard down here in the south either is a religious comment about not being condemned, don’t do drugs, and not leaving your child in a hot car by themselves for long periods of time.

In short, I wanted to get better with knowing some of the nature around me and maybe getting more social with a couple of folks. On weekdays I work over at a FedEx plant about 30 minutes into town and in the mornings on the week end is when I go to help volunteer for the parks. This particular one is known as Wheatberry Shores. The place is into the swampy areas of the south where, in particular, where the wetlands of water can be some of the deepest and be populated by alligators. Some parts, like the main trails, are usually more forest, thank God, so you don’t get nearly as swarmed with bugs so long as you have good bug spray.

The park itself isn’t a super popular destination, with only 4 active trails folks can go down and only 3 actually allowed to be traversed by the public. Travelling down the paths, each of them have different ‘difficulties’ as the place implies that mean different lengths and the pattern of the path. Each path is an offshoot of the main path everyone walks down to enter into the main trails. After talking with the folks at the main building of the park you then leave out the back end of the building and the trail is wide and open, leaving into the main bulk of the forest swamp that is the main attraction. When you go down, the first offshoot is on the left and titled ‘Weasel Woods -2 miles’. After Weasel Woods is on the right, named ‘Hickory Pass- 5 miles’, followed by ‘Lampfly Falls-10 miles’. Each path has a different thing towards the middle of each path. For Weasel Woods, there is a small animal exhibit where a few smaller creatures that are rescued by the park are kept and taken care of. I mainly volunteer there, helping with the twin flying chipmunks that have been kept by the park the last 3 years.

Hickory Pass is where most adults going by themselves go, where the largest collection of oak trees in the area are and where a sort of camping spot is. There is a fire pit, a bathroom, as well as a couple amenities out there so folks can camp out in the wilderness but also not feel stranded. Then there’s Lampfly Falls. This particular trail is the longest available to the public and also has a camping spot. It’s a long trek through some pretty rough terrain and where the park doesn’t quite keep up with in making the path very clear. I should mention there aren’t a lot of people keeping this place going and most of the time It’s me, two other folks, and the main director. Most folks don’t travel down Lampfly unless it was the summer, exactly when I’m volunteering.

You’ll notice I said there are 4 trails but only discussed 3. That’s where my little preamble here is setting up. Trail 4, unnamed, is just there. It’s roped off, nobody who works here goes down it, nobody does anything with it. As you are travelling down the main road to get to the offshoots of the different trails the path gets smaller and more upkept. Trail 4, unlike the other trails, just keeps going and isn’t the offshoot. According to the Director, they’ve had difficulties keeping the park up to snuff and being able to get to those back areas of the nature trails. They had a bunch of teens once go down the trail and get hurt, which lead to them closing the trail until more staff could be hired to care for the trail. The trail itself was noted to be almost 20 miles, obviously not in a straight line, which lead to a small isle off the bigger chunk of the mainland which then led towards the ocean. We’ve had a large number of seasoned hikers go down the trail and be fine, with some even saying it is their favorite trail and comping back every so often each season to see the changes!

Personally, I’ve been down the trail twice. The first time was when my parents thought they could do it and my mom learning really fast she was NOT cut out for being a trail hiker back then when I was really little. My dad was in the army so for Him it was nothing, and he carried me the rest of the way when my little 7-year-old feet gave way. The second time was last year when my mom tried the trail again, this time much more physically active and coasting it while this time my dad fell behind. She still doesn’t let him live it down.

Family feeling aside, both times were actually rather nice! The trail usually seemed pretty and yeah it was a bit overgrown but once you’ve gone once you get the general path and if you hike regularly, it’s pretty straight forward. Saddened they closed the trail when I volunteered, I asked if they ever thought of opening it again. The Directors response was…odd…to say the least. “Not worth it. Too many dangers and it isn’t well kept enough. If we can get someone to dedicate keeping the brush clear or cut the roots then maybe but as of now it isn’t worth it.”

I know its corny, maybe completely unworthy of the energy, but afterwards thought ‘Well if I’m already volunteering and it’s something needing done, why not?’ and next weekend I took the offer in clearing the brush and getting the path clear. Look, I’m gonna be real with you reader, I’m not athletic or weathered in ANY sense of the word. Just case I work a warehouse as my job means nothing. Yet, the idea that a family memory would forever be stripped from me was nagging at me. I’ve always been a sentimental kind of person and having good memories with my family is important to me. With some garden sheers, bags upon bags of mulch, and a Saturday with a podcast, I started making my path.

I decided on giving the path a real name, something memorable and important. Frigg’s Fortitude. My mom is pagan, and in particular we are firm respecters of the earth and have various imagery of Frigg in my mom’s kitchen. My mom found Her peace in Frigg and within Wiccan culture after some really bad experiences with my Dad’s Mormon side of the family (Of which my dad no longer worships either and is semi pagan or at least respects it). Either way, Frigg was a large thing for my mom and considering she also beat this path and I consider my mom to be someone I’ve always looked up to for wisdom, I figured it was the perfect name. Fortitude came with the knowledge the path would take a while to carve and that the path wouldn’t be easy. Going into it, I knew it would be difficult. Never the less, I was determined, guided with the idea that I was restoring something important to me and my family.

The next weekends were LONG. My first weekend I carved the trail for at least 8 hours from getting to the trail at 10 am and not leaving until a little after 6 pm. The body ached from the shoveling of the raw dirt, the scattering of the mulch, and the carving of the next shell of the trail as I slowly made my way through Frigg’s Fortitude. The first week left me sore as hell and it sure showed when I went to work the next week. The next weekend I decided to cut it back a bit and only do 6 hours and only on Saturdays. I figured by my tracking I was about halfway done with the trail and where I finished last Saturday was marked with a little red flag and that night I celebrated with a good, healthy Cheeseburger from Wendy’s.

Another week rolls by and as I’m hauling out my stuff to the part of the trail in my little 2019 Volkswagen Jetta Jacob, I’m stopped by another person who worked here, Bee, who asked what I was doing. Bee was the granddaughter of the Director, basically living and working here from the second story of the main building of the park. I told her the whole sap story and she I guess found it amusing but warned me they had some pretty hard rain last night and to be careful. I drove about as far into the trail as I could and then dragged my stuff the rest of the way. Sure enough, the only thought in my mind was ‘Fuck’. It was pretty washed at the halfway point, but I knew I had to start again soon so I could make up the progress. I diligently shoveled the ground to make the ground ripe and ready for mulch, planted the mulch, and made more little flag markers to guide the path through the woods. About 4 hours in, I was feeling that heat and needy a sit down.

As I drank, I realized at some point my podcast stopped loading on my phone and was working to reset it. It was an episode of the podcast that was one of my favorites that always got a giggle from me but for some reason the page wouldn’t load. In fact, it seemed like my service just completely died. I am out in the middle of swamp land sure, but my coverage was always great out here and usually was better than in town. I did the whole tricks, lifting the phone and reloading the page, walking back a bit of the trail, all the things. It just seemed like nothing was getting service, not even emergency service. Giving it up, I resumed my pace and just continued working the path. I finally got to where I was last week, placing a blue flag this time as I had no more red-colored flags, and with that I was about ready to collapse. I carried my gear back to the car, drove out, and decided on something else to get me in good spirits like a Starbucks or something.

Next Saturday comes; I get my things, travel to the site, and drive down the trail road yet again as far as I can before entering trail 4. When I got to my blue flag checkpoint, it seemed like where I marked was off from where I remembered placing it. I kept note with a distance marker for progress, a GPS map on my phone, and the little flags. Yet, as I was double checking my placements and map, not just one was incorrect…but they were all wrong. Each turn, each mark, each tree even was in completely incorrect spots according to what I tracked. The little red flags from before were still there, but they were completely veering off course and into different directions than before, yet still connected like a path. It’s like someone came and deliberately moved my flags and then took my blue flag and left.

Honestly, I’m just confused. I’m thinking that either it’s a prank or that maybe I’m just going crazy from working too hard. I won’t lie though; it freaked me out when I saw it but I didn’t think much of it after just chalking it up to some delusion from the heat on my part. I decided to continue forward with trying to finish this path (Albeit spending more on mulch than planned) but I am determined to get to the end and finish Figg’s Fortitude. This time, I swear it took so much more effort to get this path done, especially now that my distraction was gone and this time my service just didn’t work out the gate. I decided to focus on what I was trying to do, keep this path here.

It’s been a family memory that I want to preserve. I want future families to enjoy the path we enjoyed and maybe leave my mark here as the madman who decided to do all this shit unpaid for the hell of it. Sure, it was kinda dumb or in general a weird way to keep a memory, but it was the only distraction I had to keep myself working. It was at the end time as usual, 6pm, and I stick my now green flag into the ground that is at the halfway point. Tired as always, I make my way to the car and stick everything in. I felt exhaustion creep over me as I then moved towards the driver side of my car. As the summer sun was beginning to wane on the horizon, I felt a breeze of cool air come from Frigg’s Fortitude that suddenly travelled up my spine and jolted my eyes towards the path.

I felt my eyes just look down the road, not really focusing on anything but feeling like I just could keep looking down the path forever. The cool summer air was nice on my sore body. “R? You okay?” was then suddenly spoke from behind, from Bee. I jumped at the voice and clenched my chest a bit as my heart felt like it was choking my throat. “Shit Bee don’t sneak up on me like that. I missed what you said?” I asked. “Oh, just saying bye! I wanted to see how the trail was going but I can tell from the sight and smell you’ve had a good hard day huh?” She asked.

I laughed it off, talking about how it was difficult as always. I then posited a question to Bee, “Hey, did anybody go down trail 4 yesterday besides me after I left at 6? The flags were all different and my blue flag was missing at the end of what I worked on.” I asked. Bee shook Her head. “Just you dude, that thing isn’t worth walking if you were given money to do it.” I looked down the path, the darkness of the night becoming closer as I watched. “Cool…can you tell night watch to keep an eye. This is already exhausting as it is without having to keep getting set back every time.” I spoke. There was a bit of a sharp tone in my voice by accident, mainly from being tired. I think Bee understood because she nodded and agreed. Tired, I made my way back home and enjoyed my Sunday off, satisfied with my work on Frigg’s Fortitude.

The next week rolls around and what I find is either the most elaborate prank ever or is just straight up magic. The path of Frigg’s Fortitude changed over the week again. I don’t mean moved a few inches or a new water stream cutting the path; The entirety of the direction, arcs of the path, everything was different. I’m here at the trail now and not really sure what to do. I know for a fact I documented the path correctly and everything should go in the main directions that they should follow according to my maps. I just sit there dumbfounded, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.

At this point, I ask everybody around the park what’s going on. I first turned to Bee and asked if maybe she knew anything about what was going on or if anybody had come up behind me or something to explain what was resetting my progress every week and moving my flags. She looked through a few select CCTV footage that was wired to the security office and nothing. Nobody came up behind me, nothing changed. I watched the footage with Her and the security crew too.

We saw me packing up the Jetta, driving away, and fast forwarded the footage only to find nothing. Of course, there’s no footage of the actual trail itself. All of the trails have no cameras on the trails themselves, just the entrances. However, clearly there’s nobody else out here but me. It makes no sense, how in the hell does a landscape just change? Me and Bee decided to walk back to Frigg’s Fortitude, which I tell the name of to Bee. We both look down the trail, the winding path covered in weeds, reeds, slightly brushing up to the swamps, unsure of what to make of it as it leads out onto the little isle of trees just out of view.

I lean against the back of my car and just look over the path, my brain trying to think what the next best thing to do is. I’m combing my brain, thinking that maybe the swamp land is the issue and because the majority of the land is surrounded by water that it could be enough. Bee pointed out however, that it wouldn’t explain why the flags would still be upright and able to make a clear and concise path through the forest. “Well…why not you come back early next week. I’ll come give a hand and We’ll plot out a course of action.” She explained. I laughed, “Think you can handle throwing some dirt around a cursed forest?” I asked, obviously not actually believing the path was cursed or the forest. She shrugged. “Well, I’m at least out here being paid by my grandma…and I’m bored.” She explained, pointing back over to the main building of the wilderness park. With not a lot of ideas and at least hopefully with finishing this damn path, I await the next week.

This time around, we come much earlier in the day. Bee got in contact with a couple of other folks from the park and this time I was going to get to the end of this road. We arrived before the sun even rose; Me, Bee, Tim and Ryan. Tim and Ryan were friends of Bee’s from outside of the park. She agreed to give them some under the table money in exchange for helping me with the road. After the Director gifted me and my crew some mulch and more tools, of which she did simply to help us with our goal and seeing our desire to finish the path, we set to work. Tim and Ryan worked together to dig the path while Bee and myself cut the mulch and guided the boys on the path to follow. This time, I pulled all the stops. I had no idea what was trying to stop us, if there was anything at all, but I was going to finish this road.

As Tim and Ryan wore, I picked up a shovel and helped dig through the trail. I felt my palms ache as they grazed across the wood handle of the shovel, my feet sore from the uneven path of the swampy grass. My eyes fuzzed as the heat seemed to become stronger and stronger with each push of the shovel into the dirt and each step forwards into the swamp. Eventually, Tim and Ryan seemed to just give out. They looked exhausted, drinking water like they had never felt the softness of liquid grace their lips once in their lives. After halfway through, we seemed to hit this wall of exhaustion. Even Bee, who for most of the journey simply was cutting mulch was sweating and panting as she shook from the heat chills.

As we worked, bugs of many kinds then appeared. They swarmed our ears and assaulted our noses as they swarmed and buzzed. They must have thought us corpses, covering us like cysts and trying to taste our flesh as they ducked and weaved from our hands and arms to swat them away. By my document, we were 3/4s of the way through by 2pm. The path I carved at first was elegant and droopy, allowing you to see all of the scenery. As we came close to the end, I forfeiting that goal and simply desired the end. I felt like my body was being tortured for the goal my soul had. My arms ached as I raised my shovel and gaped the earth to prepare for the trail we pushed ourselves to create. As we neared the end, the trail soon ending after crossing into the isle and then appearing on the other side, I felt an exhaustion unlike anything I had ever felt before. Tim and Ryan had long since left an hour ago, throwing the towel on the goal. Bee stayed, mainly as someone to bounce humor off of. However, even she eventually found no strength to speak.

As the afternoon came 4:30, Bee finally spoke as we closed onto the end. “I need water…” She groaned, stumbling down Frigg’s Fortitude and away from view. In my haze, I continued. Shaking, feeling ill and mentally drained, I pressed forward. As I came towards the end, a thick fog came around me as I, alone, continued to shovel the trail. My nose ran with snot, my eyes watering as a searing headache began in the frontal lobe of my brain and my mouth dry as a desert. Then, with a final, defiant push, I was through the fog and my shovel hit what I decided to call the end. Now on one knee, feeling the soggy dirt around me as I felt exhaustion finally take hold, my eyes glanced around the island forest and I could make out something in the distance.

My eyes went wide as I thought I was hallucinating. As I looked out towards the ocean, two things were visible. The first, a stone pedestal that was about my waist high carved of a grey stone with a pillar-like shape jutting from the ground with vines twirling around the outer rim of the half pillar. The second, much larger thing before me, which stood in the middle of the foggy forest, was an archway of pure stone.
