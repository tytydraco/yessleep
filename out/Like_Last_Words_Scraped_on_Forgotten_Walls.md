**CW: self-harm, cult abuse**

\*\*\*\*\*

New York City is full of words.

They surround you, lap at your hands and feet; wherever you look on the streets of New York, words stare back at you.  Graffiti’d on red bricks and rolling metal doors and bus shelter walls and the sidewalk and the subways.  Scrawled on stickers, stuck to lampposts and on the back of street signs.  Flyers and posters for film screenings, or meetups, or concerts, or sex parties, or guitar lessons - torn, half the original words gone, creating disjointed new messages with the words on the even-older flyers taped beneath. 

*Black flowers smell like rot*, Adrienne texted me.  *Does that mean anything to you?*

*Not at all*, I responded.  *Who said it?*

*A poster.  Outside a club.*

*Lemme know if you want to talk*, I wrote.  

She didn’t respond.  I wasn’t too concerned; Adrienne and I weren’t exactly BFFs, just work buddies at an events venue in Lower Manhattan.

Two days later, she took her own life.  Her landlord, looking for unpaid rent, found her body.

Adrienne’s death devastated all of us at work.  The deterioration of her mental state over the previous two or three weeks had been stark and terrifying.  Adrienne - the wonder-girl sales manager who treated every convention, every showcase, and every social media campaign like a military operation - began missing meetings, sleeping at her desk, sobbing in the liquor room with black circles under her eyes, and jumping like a scared rabbit when approached from behind.

I’m not sure if she quit or was fired, but she stopped showing up at work.  Then she texted me that cryptic, desperate message.  And then, she was gone.  Gone to be with her twin sister, who’d died the year before in a car accident. 

*I could’ve saved her.  Because of Cyrus, I should’ve known.*  

*No.*  I couldn’t go there.

The thought buzzed around in my head like a trapped bird.  I knew it was illogical.  I knew any friend or acquaintance or therapist would assure me I was being ridiculous, that Adrienne was sick and suffering from PTSD and survivor’s guilt, and that it was actually quite narcissistic of me to cast myself as the Shining Hero on a White Horse.  

But still.  

I recalled she’d gone to a show in the Lower East Side the Friday before her breakdown.  She’d posted pictures of it on Instagram - a dive-y little place with a purple door.  *Black flowers smell like rot.*  That phrase was important, somehow, and Adrienne said she saw it on a poster outside a club.  If I could find that poster, find those words, then…

Then, I didn’t know.  But the Saturday after Adrienne’s siblings left the city with her ashes, I took the D train to Delancey Street.  

In bright daylight, the entire Lower East Side looked like the visual representation of a hangover - shabby, dirty, over-bright.  There were posters and stickers and phrases scrawled all over store fronts and lampposts and trash cans.  I couldn’t find a club with a purple door.  I couldn’t find anything having to do with black flowers.  It was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  And, even if I could find it, *Adrienne and Cyrus would both still be dead.*  

I walked, aimlessly, down Essex.  I turned right.  I turned left.  I wandered deeper into the Lower East Side, past smoke shops and bodegas with burnt-out signs and hipster restaurants with chalk-calligraphy menu boards.  In front of an abandoned sandwich shop, I stopped.

The padlocked wooden door was covered in torn posters, stickers, and crude street art.  

LANA WAS AN ETHICAL HOE, on a sheet of paper with a cartoon drawing of a cow in a ballet tutu.

SLME WLD in cartoon letters on a sticker.

Words and phrases, stacked on top of each other.  Coded messages.  Secret instructions to our alien overlords.  Or maybe, it all meant something to New Yorkers cooler than me, with their finger on the pulse of the city’s culture.  One phrase in particular caught my eye.  It was handwritten, in shimmery pink calligraphy, on a pale yellow piece of thick paper the size of a postcard.  

**Open your mouth and eat your calling whole.**  

Directly below the words, a QR code.  

It made no sense, but I felt myself drawn to the words.  I couldn’t take my eyes off them.  The morning light caught the glittery letters at the exact right angle, searing them into my eyeballs.  

*This is a message for you*, they teased.  

I pulled out my phone and took a picture.  Then, I focused on the QR code.  It took me to a website - agopsegklsd.co.wtm.  On the website was a single video file.  

A girl, out on the street in bright sunlight.  She looked about my age - mid-twenties - with frizzy brown hair, freckles, and small features on a round face.  The video had no sound.  The girl bounced around like a puppy, a goofy grin on her chapped lips.  I could tell she was nervous, out of her element, hiding her fears behind an outlook as bright and cheery as her hot pink babydoll shirt.  

The girl pranced by a series of nearly-identical houses.  All had steep, sloping roofs; three windows arranged in a triangle; and quaint covered porches.  The small lawns were overgrown with thick weeds.  Years’ worth of storms had torn half the gables from roofs and shattered windows and torn away at wooden faces.  Creeping ivy scaled walls.  When the camera pulled back, I saw the street the girl walked along was cracked, pot-holed and, in some parts, hosting the same weeds that choked the houses.  The neighborhood had clearly been abandoned.  Perhaps, for generations.  

The girl stopped in front of a house with faded red paneling.  Half of the porch had collapsed and sunk to the ground like quicksand.  She waded through the yellowed weeds and climbed up unstable steps to the front door, which had once been black, then peered through a shattered window.  Whatever she saw there must’ve been what she wanted to see, because she turned abruptly and stared directly at the mysterious camera operator.  

She smiled.  The camera zoomed in.  The more detail I saw of her face, the more uncomfortable I became.  Her nostrils flared.  Her skin was less Snow White pale than an off shade of yellow.  Her grey eyes, which appeared elfin and mischievous from afar, became those of a scared animal: wide pupils, red veins, puffy dark circles.  I knew, then, that the girl wasn’t some clout-chasing urban explorer.  That her trek to this overgrown ghost town hadn’t been a choice.

She’d been lured.  She’d been cornered.  Maybe both.  

And then the video froze, dissolved into pixels, and turned black. 

\*\*\*\*\*

The days after I watched the video, I kept on having the same nightmare.

In my dream, I was a woman.  That part felt natural - like the breasts and long hair belonged on my body, always had.  I was in a cold place with chipped walls and cockroaches breeding in corners.  There were other women there with me.  They all wore loose brown dresses, their skin dull and flaky, their hair dirty, and their faces all somber and apprehensive.  Somewhere, someone sobbed.  

I was always afraid.  But the fear was dormant, incapsulated, hidden away somewhere so I didn’t have to see it and face it.  

The whistle of a train cut through my focus.  I remembered what I was afraid of.  And I screamed and screamed and screamed.  

And then, I woke up.

I couldn’t get that video out of my mind.  I re-watched it on the subway, during my lunch break, when I was alone in my apartment, again and again, late into the night.  

*Cyrus couldn’t sleep either, towards the end.*  

*Fuck that.*  I bought sleeping pills.  The nightmares stopped.  

\*\*\*\*\*

Two weeks later, an old college buddy moved to Greenpoint.  We got together that Friday night on Christopher Street in Greenwich Village; I wanted to show him around, show off my favorite places, make him fall in love with New York City after dark.  I arrived at the restaurant early and waited outside, expecting him to call for directions at any moment, The Village being a notorious maze.  I stared across Christopher Street.  My eyes rested on a woman in an oversized brown dress, standing in front of a wine shop, staring back at me.  

Her hair was ice-blonde, curly, and cascaded down her shoulders and back like a river of gold.  She was bone-thin.  Her face… there was something wrong with her face…

I stepped closer.  A car honked as it blew by me.  When the car passed, the woman had vanished.  

The next time, I saw her up close.

It was Sunday night, a week later.  Work was booked until midnight for a wedding and I’d volunteered to cover clean-up.  The bartenders dutifully loaded all the product into crates and sent it downstairs in the dumbwaiter, then left everything in the liquor room for me to sort through.  We had a corporate event the next afternoon and I knew I wouldn’t get around to organizing in the morning, so I rolled up my sleeves and resigned myself to staying late.

I found an untouched container of lime wheels in a crate with cans of tonic.  The limes would be good for another day; I took them to the kitchen, wrapped the container in plastic wrap, and stuck it in the produce fridge.  The cooks had been cut hours before; the industrial kitchen was empty, clean, and sanitized to shiny, bleach-smelling perfection.

Something moved, by the giant grill.  

I froze.  Just feet from me, *her.*  

She smelled like urine and sweat and something putrid and coppery.  Her brown dress was stained with mold and dirt and possibly blood.  Her hands, the small bit I could see under her long sleeves, looked like the hands of a war refugee - filthy, with grime embedded under nails, covered in putrefying sores, leaking pus.  Her hair, flaxen gold from afar, hung frizzy and damp and greasy.  And her face… I couldn’t see her face.  It blurred and twisted and flickered.  

She reached a rotting hand out to me.

I cried out.

The air around her shifted.  And, like a mirage, she was gone.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next Wednesday, she inserted herself into my real life.

Not the scarred, blonde, faceless wraith.  She’d taken a vacation from haunting me.

The other *her*.

That night in the industrial kitchen turned me into an agoraphobic.  I’d become so dedicated to avoiding the outside world that I’d forgotten to buy groceries, and I didn’t even have coffee.  So I thew on my hoodie and set off for my favorite bakery on Nostrand.  

I found an empty table for me and my iced latte.  Someone had scribbled on the green-painted wood with a sharpie.  **Abandoned tunnels are best seen with dead, bloodshot eyes**\*.\*  The words felt oddly rounded, like they’d been waiting there for me.  I took a picture with my phone.  Then, I peered through the window of the coffee shop.

She sat at an outdoor table under a Covid shelter, sucking down a green smoothie.  She had a round face, with chubby, freckled cheeks and small features, rimmed by frizzy brown hair.  She wasn’t wearing her pink babydoll shirt - she’d switched it out for a collared button-down under a posh periwinkle sweater - but I recognized her immediately as the girl from the QR code.  The girl from the video.  

She glanced up.  Her grey eyes met mine.

All my fear - of the blonde wraith, of whatever haunted the edges of my nightmares - burned away like hot butter in a pan.  

This chick was real.  

I ran out of the shop and towards her.  But just then, a mass of brunch-seeking yuppies crossed the sidewalk in front of me and, by the time they’d filed into the cafe next door, the girl had gotten up, tossed her smoothie, and was making her way down Nostrand towards the C train.  She wasn’t running, but she wasn’t waiting up for me, either.

Silently, carefully, keeping a good distance between us, I followed her.  She turned left.  She turned right.  She turned another corner and, when I next caught sight of her, she no longer walked alone.  A second woman strode beside her.  Red hair cascaded down her slender back, and she wore a blue romper with yellow flowers.  They kept it up for awhile - leisurely strolling along, just fast enough where I couldn’t approach them, yet not to lose me completely.

The curly-haired girl had changed, I noticed.  In the video, she’d embodied golden retriever energy.  The woman I followed down the street appeared calm.  Confident.  Her mannerisms fluid and purposeful.  

They stopped in front of a large building with a brick face and waited, leaning on their hips like high schoolers at the bus stop.  When I got close - not too close, just close enough - I saw the two girls had picked up another friend: a tall, skinny black guy with dreds and a Texas Chainsaw Massacre t-shirt.  All three emitted *smoke*.  A grayish haze hung around them, with neon yellow-green undertones.  

Simultaneously, the trio stared straight at me.  They smiled private little smiles.  Their eyes twinkled in recognition of the game.  Single-file, they jogged up a short flight of steps and through a glass-paned push door.  I looked up.  They’d led me to one of the Brooklyn libraries.

I scanned the large main room of the library.  A bored-looking clerk scrolled on her phone behind the checkout desk, two rough-looking men in dirty clothes sat in front of the ancient computers, and a young nanny absentmindedly rocked a sleeping baby in an expensive stroller.  I couldn’t see Curly, Red, or Goth Boy.  They must have hidden from me amongst the tall shelves of books.

*There.*  Slender peals of yellow-green smoke wafted from the adult fiction section.  I jogged across the room and entered at the R-slash-S shelves, which was where I could swear the hazy fumes had originated.  But I saw no sign of the three.  I turned a corner, then another; allowed myself to become lost in the sea of paperbacks with laminated covers.  At the J, K, L shelves, I took a long breath through my nose.  I stumbled, bent over, and gagged. 

*Good God*, something stunk.  It smelled like a festival porta-potty crossed with chicken nuggets left rotting in an office fridge, with a twist of old pennies. 

THUD!

I whirled around.  A book had landed, loudly, on the carpet at my feet.  It was heavy and hard-backed, with a worn red cover that looked about a hundred years old.  I picked the book up and stared at it.  AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE: 1940-1979.  Well, that definitely didn’t belong in the fiction section.  Which meant either it had been mis-shelved and fell by chance, or else it hadn’t so much dropped from the shelves as been thrown in my path, specifically for me to find.  

I took in another waft of the rotten stench.

I turned the book over in my hands; it fell open.  Someone had used a folded piece of printer paper as a bookmark.  I scanned the pages it opened to.  On the left, a detailed description of Mid-Century Modernism and the design of northeastern churches.  On the right, a sketch depicting an example of Mid-Century Modernism: a squarish church with faux columns, a gently sloping roof, a tall steeple and a circular stained-glass window depicting a haloed child cuddling a lamb.  Behind the church, there was a line of fir trees and an elevated railroad.  The caption read - *First Methodist Church, Pennsylvania.*  

Oh-kay.  Not sure what that had to do with anything.  

I set the book on the ground and unfolded the bookmark.  On the inside of the folded paper, there was a message in one word.

*Revelation.*  Written in calligraphy, with a sparkling pink pen.  

An off-key, baritone note rang out behind me.  The pitch triggered an instinct buried deep in my subconscious.  Apprehension spiked the hair on the back of my neck, trickled down my spine, tightened my muscles.  

I whirled around.  And there she was.

That *she*.  The dirty blonde wraith - in full, disgusting detail - lingered between the rows of books.  She smelled like rot and nasty BO and copper.  And I saw her face.  God, I saw her face.  Her eyes were hidden behind fat purple hematomas, as though someone had attacked her with a hammer.  A jagged hole gaped where her nose should’ve been.  Her cheeks were purple and swollen and dotted with semicircular red cuts.  Teeth.  

She lifted her arm.  She opened her jagged, bloody mouth.  A low-pitched growl rang in my ears, through my brain, into my eyes, throbbing and expanding…

\*\*\*\*\*

I regained awareness sometime later, sitting awkwardly on the concrete sidewalk outside the library, my back against a lamp post.  A middle-aged Caribbean woman stood in front of me, hands on her knees.

“You okay, baby?”  she asked. 

I forced myself up onto my feet.  “I’m fine, thanks.”

The Caribbean woman frowned.  But I was standing and walking, so she must’ve figured I was as good as I was going to get.  

“You need me to call you someone?” she asked, smiling reassuringly.  

I shook my head.  “Nah, I’m fine.  I’m just gonna head home.”

She nodded, offered me one last smile, and walked back across the street towards the grey brownstone that must’ve been her home.  Turned around, I opened Google Maps before I inadvertently wandered ten blocks in the opposite direction.  

I noticed there was a flier stuck to that lamppost.  

Cartoonish clip art of a red-eyed, graphically stoned Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, and Dumbo.  *No party,* it read.  *September 10th.  No party at the Butler Outfit.  Absolutely DO NOT come to the Butler Outfit on September 10th, 2024.  There will be no party here.*

*\*\*\*\*\**

I spent the next thirty minutes in a Bed-Stuy coffee shop, scrolling Reddit’s NYC subs.  The internet informed me the Butler Outfit in Williamsburg wasn’t an actual venue - it was the unofficial, colloquial name for an abandoned store that had once sold discounted furniture.  The business shut down a few years ago; the space had yet to be permanently rented.  It remained under the stewardship of a certain property manager known to “misplace” the key for the benefit of shady promoters who slipped him a couple hundreds.  

“Don’t go to a party at the Butler Outfit alone,” cautioned one Redditor.  “My friend got roofied there.”

I didn’t want to party at the Butler Outfit at all.  But if I wanted to figure out what was happening to me - if I wanted it all to stop - that flier outside the library presented my next set of instructions.  

Over the next few days, I caught myself humming a melody I couldn’t place.  Coming up with poetic verses in my head.  

*Abandoned tunnels under cold, dead earth.*

*With sightless eyes, I cry for rebirth.*  

The urge was unfamiliar - I’m not musically inclined at all, and I didn’t even go through a crappy poetry phase in high school.  But it became suddenly pleasurable, plucking words that went with other words, tapping out rhythms with my toes.  

And the nightmares had returned.  

In the first, I was back in that cold, empty house.  It was bigger than I’d initially imagined - a labyrinth of dusty wood, accentuated with spiderwebs and tenanted by rats and crawling things.  My sisters and I sat in rows in a wide room.  We were all dressed in brown, our faces bare, our hair matted, our stomachs empty, our vanity humbled out of us.  We raised our hands to the sky in a stretch, then leaned forward into a yoga pose, striving for endorphins like orgasm.  One of my sisters sobbed.  The stench of urine filled the room; a damp spot extended on a young brown-skinned sister’s dress.  

Then, footsteps.  A figure moved in the shadows.  He took my sister’s arm and lead her away.  She risked one last look back at us, her face a mask of terror, and then she was gone.  

We extended our arms and chanted a low, reverberating note.  Our chant was broken by sharp, animalistic screams.  

The second nightmare came two nights later. 

I could barely see; I was engulfed in hazy darkness, somewhere damp and foul-smelling.  My bones ached.  Something wet slid down my cheeks.  I was tired.  Too tired to move, too tired to cry out.  Bodies writhed beside mine; a hand brushed against me, a foot kicked at my knee.  Small, cold toes skittered across my leg; whiskers tickled, and then sharp pain.  

I screamed.  Then, I coughed.  Smoke singed my nostrils, coated my throat, settled into my lungs…

I woke up hacking and shaking, tangled in my blanket.  

And then, there were the *others*.  

I saw one in Times Square, on the way home after a vodka showcase for work.  She stood at an artisan’s table, admiring charcoal drawings, looking like a normal twenty-something.  Asian, dressed in jeans and fuzzy boots and a denim jacket, hair up in a ponytail.  But she glowed.  Grey fog, with a yellow-green hue beneath it, hung off her like smoke over dry ice.  

The next appeared in the grocery store.  A man this time, in his mid-twenties, with a blonde undercut and a noir-ish black duster, comparing two brands of sourdough bread.  He too was encased in a smoky, greenish-yellow mist.  The door opened, a breeze blew in, and I smelled rotten fast food, copper, and pit sweat.  Then, the guy turned.  He caught my eye.  And he smiled - a smug, conspiratorial smile.  As though we shared a nasty little secret.

I needed answers.

So, on September 10th, I left work at nine and took the L train to Williamsburg, to seek out the party at the Butler Outfit.  I walked a couple blocks to a still, poorly-lit mixed-used neighborhood.  *This should be the place*, I thought.  I saw a closed and metal-gated immigration law office, an abandoned store front that had once been a shoe shop, and… *there*.  

A brick shop space covered in graffiti, with papered windows and an uninviting black door. I’d have walked right by it, except the storefront glowed.  Pale yellow-green light emanated from the windows.  Little wisps of grey smoke snaked out between bricks.  *Yep.  Message received.*  

I approached the door and knocked.  Nothing.  Then, I noticed a call box with a big red button.  I pressed the button.  There was a rush of static, and then a man’s voice.

“Password?”

Crap.  The flier hadn’t said anything about a password.  

*It didn’t need to.*

“Abandoned tunnels are best seen with dead, bloodshot eyes.”

A moment of apprehension.  I hoped that was the password.  I also hoped it *wasn’t* the password.  

With a loud buzz, the door opened.

\*\*\*\*\*

I recall the rest of the night in pieces.  

Sad, orphaned pieces of furniture lay around the main floor of the Butler Outfit.  A bored security guard sat amongst them.  He pointed me towards an open door in the back, which lead down stairs to a basement, where a party was in full swing.  

A DJ played slow, repetitive, wordless house music.  It settled around my nerves, into the grooves of my brain, and it calmed me, hypnotized me.  I sipped a PBR I’d paid too much money for, sold by a guy with a cooler and a paper sign.  There was a zero percent chance this establishment maintained a liquor license.  Red and green strobe lights flickered and flashed; a disco ball hung from the ceiling.  A half-naked guy with glow-in-the-dark paint slathered all over his chest grinded against a panties-and-pasties clad girl.  I fell into conversation with a guy on a couch; I don’t remember what we talked about, but his teeth were disturbingly white.  He gave me a pill.  I took it.

The blonde wraith was there.  I saw her on the dance floor, swaying and twirling, running her bleeding and pustule-dotted fingers through her long, matted hair.  I didn’t fear her, then.  I felt myself drawn to her.  And then I was dancing beside her, spinning and thrashing about, raising and dropping my arms, uninhibited, as we’d been that summer’s day in Prospect Park, dressed in white, overcome with the tingling bliss of love and sisterhood, leaping and spinning and collapsing into each others arms… and then I saw him, our lover, our husband, our father, our messiah, our north star…

I jerked, with an unpleasant lurch, back to reality.  The blonde wraith was gone.  Pain cut through my head; my stomach flipped, my jaw ached.  I half-dove, half-stumbled for the rickety red bathroom door, fell to my knees on sticky tile, and expelled the contents of my stomach.  I flushed, then puked more, then flushed again, then retched, and finally the spinning stopped and my muscles regained their tone, and I was able to stand upright and flick on the light switch.  Dingy, brownish light filled the tiny room.  I washed my hands and splashed water on my face.  Then, I noticed the words.

Band stickers.  Magazine cutouts.  Old posters for parties long since partied.  Names and numbers and drunken messages scrawled across the dirty red walls and scratched into the cracked mirror.  

DANDY GOOP, with a graphic of a skateboarder showing his ass.

*Keep on reaching for that beautiful life*, in red pen.  In black: *reach for my dick*.  

*Catalina is a piddling puss!*

OPYH INC

**Sadness will become your only friend.** 

I stared at that last phrase: *sadness will become your only friend*.  And it began to glow.  The words, carved crudely into the mirror, emitted piss-yellow light.  Smoke poured from the shallow cuts.  It filled the room, blinding me to all but those glowing golden words.  *Sadness will become your only friend.*  

The mirror bubbled, like hot lava.  Searing black balls protruded from the cracked glass.  The balls became fingers.  Then thumbs.  Then whole hands - pitch black, putty, reaching hands.  Reaching for me.  Cold hands on my hands, clutching my arms, running fingers through my hair, brushing my face…

The last thing I remembered, before the smoke thickened and reality blurred and blackness overtook me, was the sound of my own primal screams.

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up warm.  Two thoughts popped into my mind at the same time: w*here am I*?  And, *I need to pee right now.*  

Luckily the resolution to one of the two was right in front of me - a small bathroom across a carpeted floor.  I threw a blanket off myself, climbed out of my bed du jour (a green couch), and stumbled into a much more inviting commode than the one I’d encountered the night before.  My eyes were bloodshot and my hair stuck out at odd angles, but I hadn’t sustained any obvious injuries from my adventure in a drug den.

After peeing and cleaning myself up a bit, I wandered back into the room where I’d slept.  It was, in one word, witchy.  Purple sponge-painted walls with stencils of stars and moons.  Herbs, crystals, an altar in one corner, and a bookcase filled with Tarot guides and Goddess Magic and Healing Plants.  A doorway lead to a railway-style bedroom with an empty wall-mounted bed, then through a second doorway into a small kitchen.

A woman stood there, pouring freshly-made coffee into a mug.  She saw me and smiled.

“Coffee?”
