I think something followed me; I can’t be completely sure, but I’m about ninety percent convinced it’s crouched behind my couch right now. 

I keep glancing toward that shadowy spot, half-expecting something to skitter out. My heart is pounding so loud that it feels like it might make my ears explode.

Let me start from the beginning, because I feel like I need to get this all out. Maybe if I write it down, it’ll make more sense or at least I’ll feel less crazy.
 
My boyfriend, Josh, and his two buddies decided it would be “fun” to explore this abandoned hotel that sits way up on a mountain road outside of town. You know the kind that every town seems to have close by, but always in the middle of nowhere: boarded up, rumored to be haunted, a big “No Trespassing” sign that only makes people more curious. 

Normally, I love horror movies and creepy stories, but I’ve got enough common sense to know that trespassing on a dark, condemned property in the middle of nowhere is never a good idea. Still, I let them talk me into going. I’m kicking myself for that right about now.
 
We drove in Josh’s old Jeep, taking the twisting roads that led higher and higher into the woods. We parked behind a bunch of trees, nearly invisible from the main road, which only added to the uneasy feeling building in my stomach. My breath was shaky when I stepped out of the car and saw the massive shape of the hotel looming ahead, it was real, not just a legend. I almost hoped that it was just a myth, and we could go home after a good laugh.

It was bigger than I imagined, and in worse shape, broken windows, warped boards nailed to the entrances. The musty smell of damp earth and rotting wood hit me before we even got inside.
 
We found a back door leading down into the basement. The chain and lock was busted, someone else must’ve broken the lock before us. Inside, the air was stale, like nobody had been down there in years. Mice skittered out of the beams of our flashlights, and the sound of our footsteps echoed in that cold darkness. My nerves were already on edge, but the real scare came when we heard footsteps and faint music drifting from somewhere above us, like an old radio was playing just out of reach.
 
Josh motioned for us to keep quiet, so we moved in a single file up a set of rickety stairs to the first floor. Each wooden step creaked so loudly I thought they’d snap at any moment. By the time he reached the top, I was sure my heart would burst from sheer anxiety. Suddenly, he froze… just stopped dead in his tracks. He stood there, rigid, for what felt like a small eternity. My mouth went dry. I wanted to call his name, but my fear clamped my throat shut.
 
Then, his eyes went wide, like he’d seen something so horrible he couldn’t even form words. He raced back down the stairs, nearly knocking us over. We didn’t ask questions,  just ran. We dashed straight outside, across the overgrown estate, and piled into his Jeep, slamming the doors behind us. The entire drive home was a suffocating silence. Not a word from Josh, not a single explanation. He dropped off his friends first, then me, never once meeting my eyes. No goodbye, no “talk to you tomorrow,” nothing.
 
So here I am now, standing in my own doorway. The house is dark except for the glow of my phone screen and a small table lamp. The second I walked in, I felt it. That chilling sensation like I’d brought someone (or something) back with me. 

I thought I saw a shadow dart behind the couch. I can’t stop staring at the spot, wondering if my eyes were just playing tricks on me… or if there’s really something there.
 
My mom’s working the late shift, so I’m alone until she gets back. I keep hoping to hear her key in the lock at any second, but the house is deathly quiet. With every passing moment, I’m fighting the urge to run out the front door and not look back. But what if it follows me out there, too?
 
I don’t know what he saw in that hotel, and I don’t know what latched onto me. I just know this awful feeling won’t go away. I’m typing this as calmly as I can, pretending everything is normal. But if I tilt my head just a bit, I swear I can see that shape behind the couch, like it’s waiting for me.
 
I’m praying that if I act like everything is fine, if I stay perfectly still, it’ll lose interest. Or maybe it’ll vanish when the lights come on. I’m not sure what else to do but wait. I really hope I’m just imagining things. Because if I’m not… Well, I guess this will be the last thing that I post.
