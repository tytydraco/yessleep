It was a quiet Sunday afternoon, the kind that settles over everything like a soft sigh. Outside my apartment window, the sky stretched pale and cloudless, and the hum of the city felt distant, like it belonged to someone else’s life. Inside, I moved slowly, cleaning up after another long writing session. My notebook lay open on the coffee table, pages filled with half-finished poems and story fragments, the ink from my blue fountain pen still drying in places.

I capped the pen and slid it into the spine of the notebook, then returned it to the shelf. I had spent most of the weekend writing—stories, poems, anything to keep my mind off the workweek ahead. The spreadsheets and emails could wait. For now, it was just me, my notebook, and the quiet hum of the apartment.

I should’ve been preparing for Monday, but something tugged at me—a quiet pull toward the corner of the room, where an old photo album sat beneath a stack of books I hadn’t touched in years.

I hesitated. Then I walked over, pulled it free, and brushed off the thin layer of dust. The cover creaked as I opened it, and suddenly I was back in Red Horse.

Page after page, the memories came flooding in—snapshots of fishing trips with Dad, hikes through golden fields, beach days with sunburned noses and sticky fingers. There were photos of the farm market in full swing, of sunflowers taller than me, of the old barn where I used to hide when I needed to be alone.

And then I turned the page—and there she was.

Emilia.

Her smile hit me like a punch to the chest. She stood beside me and my parents, her arm slung casually over my shoulder, her eyes bright with something I hadn’t seen in years. I remembered that day. I remembered the way the sun lit up her hair, the way she laughed at something I said, the way everything felt like it was exactly where it was supposed to be.

My throat tightened. I didn’t even realize my hands were shaking until the album slipped from my lap and hit the floor with a soft thud. The photo fluttered loose and landed face-down.

I wiped my eyes and reached for it—but something caught my attention. There was a small, folded piece of paper taped to the back. My heart skipped. I knew what it was. I had taped it there myself, years ago, when the memory was still too sharp to face head-on.

With trembling fingers, I peeled the tape away and unfolded the paper. The handwriting was unmistakable—Emilia’s. The ink had faded, but the words were still clear, still full of the warmth and hope of that day.

I read it aloud, my voice barely above a whisper:

*A regular day in our little farm town,*

*Where sunflowers sway and tractors hum,*

*Where the sky feels endless and the breeze feels kind,*

*And everything just... fits.*

*But what makes it more than just another day,*
*Is you.*


*So maybe this is silly, but I’ll say it anyway—*

*Will you be my boyfriend?*

*Let’s make each other smile forever.*

I sat there for a long time, the poem resting in my lap, the photo beside it. Outside, the sun had started to dip, casting long shadows across the floor. Inside, the past had come rushing back, and with it, the question that had haunted me for years:

What really happened to Emilia?

I remember the night before it all changed more clearly than I remember most of last week.

I was sixteen, sitting at my desk in the attic bedroom of our old farmhouse in Red Horse. The air was warm and still, the kind of summer night that made the walls feel closer than they were. I had just finished the last problem in my math homework, the numbers still swimming behind my eyes as I leaned back and stretched. For a moment, everything felt simple. Normal.

Then I looked out the small window above my desk.

At first, I thought it was a shooting star—a streak of light cutting across the sky. But then it did something no star should ever do: it made a sharp U-turn. Not a curve. A turn. Like it had changed its mind. Then it stopped. Just… stopped. Hovering.

I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. Looked again.

Gone.

I sat there for a while, staring at the empty sky, trying to convince myself I’d imagined it. Probably just a plane. Or a satellite. Or maybe I’d been reading too many science fiction stories again. I laughed it off, but something about it stuck with me—like a splinter in the back of my mind.

Still, that wasn’t what made the night unforgettable.

What made it unforgettable was the decision I made after. I was going to tell Emilia how I felt.

We’d been best friends since we were kids—inseparable, really. But somewhere along the way, my feelings had shifted. I’d tried to ignore it, tried to pretend it was just a phase, but it wasn’t. I loved her. And I couldn’t keep it to myself anymore.

I barely slept that night. I kept rehearsing what I’d say, how I’d say it. I imagined every possible reaction—her laughing, her crying, her walking away. But I had to try. I had to know.

The next day was a warm Friday afternoon. The kind of day where the sun feels like it’s leaning in close, listening. We met at Pearsons Park, like we always did. It was our place—wide open fields of tall grass and wildflowers, winding dirt paths, and the old wooden bench under the willow tree. It was quiet, peaceful. Safe.

I was nervous. My hands wouldn’t stop fidgeting. I was just about to speak when Emilia reached into her bag and pulled out a folded piece of paper.

“I wrote something,” she said, not quite meeting my eyes.

She unfolded it and began to read.

It was a poem. Her poem. A confession.

She loved me too.

I didn’t even let her finish before I pulled her into a hug, laughing and crying at the same time. I said yes—of course I said yes. It felt like the world had finally clicked into place.

For the first time in my life, everything felt right.

And for the last time, everything felt safe.

The wind moved through Pearsons Park like a slow breath, stirring the tall grass in gentle waves. Emilia and I walked hand in hand, still glowing from what had just happened. Her fingers were warm in mine, and every few steps, we’d glance at each other and smile like we were both afraid it might all vanish if we looked away too long.

The sun was beginning to dip, casting long shadows across the field. The light turned everything gold—her hair, the grass, even the dirt path beneath our feet. It felt like the world was holding its breath for us.

Then I saw it.

Just behind us, maybe twenty feet back, a patch of grass moved—wrongly. It wasn’t swaying with the wind like the rest. It was pushing against it, bending in the opposite direction, like something was crawling through it.

I stopped walking.

Emilia looked at me, puzzled. “What is it?”

I stared at the grass. It had stopped moving. Everything looked normal again.

“Nothing,” I said, forcing a smile. “Thought I saw a rabbit or something.”

We kept walking, but I couldn’t shake the feeling. I glanced back again.

There it was.

Closer this time.

The same patch, moving deliberately, like it was following us. Then it froze again, perfectly still, as if it knew I was watching.

A chill crept up my spine.

I didn’t say anything at first. I didn’t want to scare her. Maybe it was just my imagination. Maybe I was still rattled from the night before, from that strange light in the sky.

But then Emilia leaned in, her voice barely a whisper.

“Did you see that too?”

I stopped walking. My heart was pounding now.

She didn’t look at me. She just kept her eyes on the grass behind us, her expression tight, her jaw clenched.

We didn’t speak. We didn’t need to.

We ran.

The tall grass whipped at our legs as we sprinted toward the edge of the park, our hands still locked together. I didn’t look back. I didn’t want to see whatever it was. I just ran, lungs burning, heart hammering, the sound of our footsteps swallowed by the wind.

But I could feel it.

Something was behind us.

Something was coming.

We tore through the last stretch of tall grass, the edge of Pearsons Park finally in sight. Relief surged through me—until I slammed into something that wasn’t there.

It was like hitting glass, but there was nothing in front of me. No shimmer, no distortion. Just air—and an invisible wall that sent me sprawling backward onto the ground.

Emilia cried out as she collided with it too, her hands outstretched, pressing against the unseen surface. I scrambled to my feet and pounded on it, shouting her name, shouting for help—but the sound felt wrong. Muffled. Distant. Like it was being swallowed before it could even leave my mouth.

We were sealed in.

I turned, scanning the park’s edge—and spotted Charlie, the mailman, walking his usual route. I waved frantically, slammed my fists against the barrier, screamed his name.

He saw us.

He walked toward us, confused, his mouth moving—but we heard nothing. Not a word. Not even a whisper. It was like we were watching a silent film, trapped behind soundproof glass.

I backed up, took a running start, and threw myself at the wall.

It didn’t budge.

Pain exploded through my shoulder as I hit the ground again, gasping. Emilia knelt beside me, her face pale, her eyes wide with fear.

Then we saw them—Lily and Sam, our elderly neighbors, standing at the edge of the park, pointing behind us, their faces twisted in horror. Their mouths moved rapidly, shouting something, maybe warning us—but still, we heard nothing.

Charlie turned, looked where they were pointing—and ran.

I turned too.

And saw it.

Tall. Robed. Silent.

It hovered just beyond the grass, its form almost blending with the shadows. Slender and impossibly symmetrical, hiding its body beneath a flowing robe that shimmered with iridescent colors—like oil on water, shifting with every breath of wind. The robe concealed most of its body, but now and then, a long, grey arm would emerge, impossibly smooth and jointless, as if sculpted from stone.

Its head was hidden beneath a sleek, obsidian helmet—featureless, faceless, a void that seemed to drink in the light around it. There were no eyes, no mouth, no expression. Just a black emptiness that watched us.

It didn’t move. It didn’t speak.

It just floated there, silent and still.

Emilia screamed—but even her voice sounded strange inside the bubble. Like it was being pulled inward, away from the world.

Then she began to rise.

Her feet lifted off the ground, her arms limp at her sides, her body stiff as if caught in invisible strings. She floated upward, slowly, silently, her eyes locked on mine.

“No!” I shouted, finally breaking free of my paralysis. I ran toward her, reaching out—but that thing raised one hand.

And I flew backward.

The impact with the barrier knocked the wind out of me. I crumpled to the ground, dazed, barely conscious.

Two beams of light descended from the sky—blinding, brilliant, and impossibly quiet. They enveloped Emilia and it in a soft glow.

And then they were gone.

Just like that.

Then, sound rushed back in like a crashing wave—birds, wind, voices.

I heard shouting—dozens of them—rushing toward me. Townspeople. Witnesses. Questions flying from every direction.

But I couldn’t answer.

I just lay there, staring at the empty sky, my heart broken open, my world forever changed.

The days after Emilia vanished felt like a dream I couldn’t wake up from.

At first, the town of Red Horse was stunned into silence. People whispered, stared, avoided eye contact. But it didn’t take long for the fear to set in. Real fear. The kind that makes people lock their doors in the middle of the day and jump at the sound of the wind.

Everyone had seen it. The light. The thing in the field. The way she was taken.

And yet, when the news vans came, when the reporters showed up with their microphones and skeptical smiles, no one believed us.

They called it a hoax. A mass hallucination. Some even accused us of staging it for attention. The footage people had taken on their phones was dismissed as doctored. The eyewitness accounts were twisted into punchlines on late-night talk shows. We became a joke.

Emilia’s parents didn’t stop fighting. They went on every local station that would have them, wrote letters to anyone who might listen. They begged for help. For answers. For someone—anyone—to believe them.

No one did.

Families started leaving. Some out of fear. Others out of shame. Red Horse became a ghost town in slow motion. Businesses closed. The school lost half its students. People stopped saying Emilia’s name.

But I couldn’t forget.

Everywhere I went, I saw her. In the empty bench at Pearsons Park. In the corner booth at the diner where we used to split milkshakes. In the mirror, in my own eyes, where the guilt never left.

I should’ve done something. I should’ve pulled her down. I should’ve fought harder. I should’ve—

But I didn’t.

And I couldn’t change that.

When I turned twenty, I packed a suitcase full of notebooks and left Red Horse. Not to escape. To search. I told myself that if she was still out there—somewhere, somehow—I had to find her. I didn’t care how long it took. I didn’t care if it was impossible.

I just couldn’t let her be gone.

Not like that.

So I searched.

For years, I followed every rumor, every strange sighting, every whisper that sounded even remotely like her name. I crossed cities, borders, oceans. I spoke to people who claimed to have seen lights in the sky, who swore they’d been taken and returned. I filled notebook after notebook with dead ends.

But I never found her.

And slowly, the world moved on.

Except for one thing.

Every year, on the anniversary of the day she disappeared, I came back.

It doesn’t feel like five years. Some days it feels like five minutes. Others, like five lifetimes.

Every July third, I return to Red Horse. I drive the same road, pass the same weathered signs, and park in the same gravel lot beside Pearsons Park. The town has changed—new faces, new buildings—but the field is the same. The grass still sways in the wind like it remembers.

People know me now. Not by name, necessarily, but by ritual. The quiet figure who returns once a year, always at the same hour, always walking alone into the tall grass. Only my parents and Emilia’s parents come with me now. They don’t speak. They just stand at the edge of the field, giving me space.

I step into the grass, the wind brushing against my arms like a memory. I carry two things: the photo of Emilia, and a folded sheet of paper—my own poem, written for her, for this moment.

I stop at the same spot. The place where she vanished.

And I read.

*I still see you in the tall grass,*

*where the wind once carried your laugh.*

*I wasn’t fast enough.*

*I wasn’t strong enough.*

*But I’m still here—*

*searching, waiting,*

*hoping the sky brings you back to me.*


When I finish, I fold the paper and press it to my chest. The others have already turned to leave, giving me time. I stay a little longer, letting the silence settle.

In five years, I’ve searched everywhere. I’ve followed rumors, chased dead ends, spoken to people who claimed to know something—anything. But there was never a trace. No sightings. No signals. No answers.

Until now.

Just as I turn to go, I see it.

A small piece of paper, half-buried near the path. It flutters slightly in the breeze, like it’s been waiting for me.

I kneel, heart pounding, and pick it up.

The handwriting stops me cold.

It’s hers.

I unfold it slowly, afraid it might vanish if I move too fast. The words are soft, lyrical—like all her poems—but there’s something else in them now. Sorrow. Loneliness. A voice reaching out from somewhere far away.

*I wake in dark that never ends,*

*Hands like ice, minds that bend—*

*They tear my thoughts, they twist my skin,*

*And call it learning from within.*

*But through the pain, I see your face,*

*A memory time cannot erase.*

*I whisper your name into the void,*

*The only light they’ve not destroyed.*

I read it again. And again.

It’s her.

Somehow, impossibly—it’s her.

I don’t know how it got here. I don’t know what it means. But I know one thing with absolute certainty:

She’s still out there.

And after all these years of wandering, of chasing shadows and silence—I finally have something real.

So I’m coming back.

Not just to remember her.

But to find her.
