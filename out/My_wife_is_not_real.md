Hi im alex, My wife and i never got along, but i still cared for her, and im worried. She will stare at me for no reason, and smile as a reaponce to everything. I dont even know if shes human. 
It started 3 months ago. I dont know if im hallucinating but, 3 months ago something awful happened.

 my mom is 62. she never was mentally straight. she would weave in and out of being mentally ill. but in march she was diagnosed with dementia. It was progressing fast, so we put her in a nursing home. her brain started rotting as time went on. Eventually she stopped eating. she said she didnt feel hungry. she started to become more skinny, and then, she stopped using the toilot and would leave a mess for her caretakers to clean up. But then. her caretakers came to her door one morning. "Ms Baker, we have food ready for you."

She didn't respond. The caretaker kept asking until, she went in. There lied mrs baker bleeding from her mouth. Her body was cold and pale.
EMS was called for her, she could not be revived. 
they called me. about her death. And asked if they could do a autopsy, i declined. because it was clear it was her dementia that caused her death. 
I took a 3 weeks off of work. As i got better. my wife got worse, she acted strange, as if she was in fear always jittery, and looking around, if im being honest i thought there was something she was not telling me. but i didnt mind it too much for the first week. until, our dog, bit our neighbour.

not hard, but firm. animal control said we didnt need to put it down, just keep a eye on it.
but my wfe insisted on putting it down, i didnt quite get it, it worried me deeply. I never seen her act like this. i ignored her requests,  but then she would yell at me all the time for small things, until ond day, "look amaria, i am sick of it! Get off my back!" she ran off and wimpered in our room.

 I made it up with her. But the next day she was even more odd. she looked at me and as i got up and said "are you afraid now?" I responded with a confused no. She presisted saying "you never listen to me" "honey i do listen to you." I then said 
"are you mad about the dog?" She walked off up stairs. 

i follow her up there. she was there gazing at me in the closet. still staring at me, she slowly pulled a shotgun. I ran but she said "this is not for you?" she ran at the dog, grabbing it by the collar, dragging it outside. She shot it. It jolted back, its corpse shaking, and it bled out. I cried and broke down. she came over to comfort me, but then i tried taking her gun, me, and her struggling with it
She took it, and i ran into the car.

 she had the keys, she was planning to kill me. I walked into the home. I went into our closet, and found a desert eagle. I reloaded it and went, looking for her. I could not find her, 
I buried the dog it our backyard. And put her favorite toy over the soil. 
I still have not been able to find her. But it feels like shes in the home, even if i cant find her, i can feel her watching me, always.

The end.
