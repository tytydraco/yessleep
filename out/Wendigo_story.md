Hey y’all, I have been binging on no sleep stories all day due to a dream I had that chalked up some past trauma I had when I was 11. I had been on a journey to improve my mental health and explained, for the first time to someone, this presence that would creep into my life and try to guide me, though I never knew where and never listened. I always would describe it as someone whispering DIRECTLY in my ear, lips pressed on the ear but talking so softly but briskly. I found it wierd that as soon as I said that out loud for the first time, that night I had a dream that was eventually infiltrated by the entity that I pictured said it in the first place.

Now on to the origins, I was 11 and from the Cleveland, OH area. All day everyday I would gather my entire neighborhood to run around our houses, the condo complex behind our houses, the train tracks behind those, and miniature patches of woods mixed with some soft industrial buildings. One day, we’re having a nerf war and I run through my neighbors yard past her fence which led to this crop of trees to my right, a condo to my left and straight view about 200 feet away of the train tracks through some trees. At this moment I had begun to feel truly at peace, mindless if you will where my typical inner voice had silenced and I was just existing. As soon as this feeling occurs I round the fence corner to the view I described and there at the train tracks stands this deer-like creature, giant antlers but with a human-like face. I say human-like because where the eyes, nose, mouth were supposed to be weren’t actaully there, just the imprints of them as if someone starting molding a face out of clay but never started the details. I stood absolutely frozen in this things gaze with this crushing feeling overtaking my body as if I was being squeezed and snapped at the limbs but was still frozen. This went on for what felt like half an hour, when the creature just darted down the tracks. I was a bit discombobulated after that but I could not stop thinking about it. That same day, I gathered my neighborhood, told them I saw “a dinosaur” and that we needed to find it. That whole week I had everyone I knew that wasn’t an adult(cus who tf would believe me) searching for that thing I saw without them or me really knowing what it was. Never saw it again, but that was the first time that encroaching voice ever whispered in my ear.

Now, fastforward to freshman year of college as two depressed teens are smoking weed and shooting shit in my backyard. My friend and I have always been open with each other when it comes to any emotional shit that happens to us, but my friend had something he wanted to say but was hesitant. I told him I would not judge and after some sighs and glances from myself he finally spoke: one day in sophomore year of high school, he was driving with a friend that had recently gotten his license. They were just driving in the night with no goal because that’s what teens do in Ohio, just drive. About 10 minutes from where my encounter occurred, on this wide, main road, my friend saw this disfigured creature with a molded “faceless” and snapped limbs standing by a lamppost. Him and his friend went silent and after 30 seconds of silence the other opened up and asked “did you see that” in the most shaken voice. My friend looked back and it was gone. Now what the strangest thing was, my friend said, was that right before they saw that thing, he had felt a complete sense of calm and happiness. Him and his friend were just enjoying themselves and weren’t thinking about anything, but then the creature appeared.

Now after this I shared my story and I grabbed two pieces of paper, handed my friend one and told him to draw what he saw. We went to different sides of the table where we couldn’t see each other and I shit you not we draw the same thing, only difference was the antlers. But the important part was that face… I hesitate to say faceless because the concept of a face was there it was just unfinished…

I am interested to hear people’s opinions, we always thought we saw skinwalkers but those don’t live in Ohio. Wendigo would make sense but I’m pretty sure those have eyes. My theory is that of a physically present emotion or state of mind, since the creature struck when we felt at peace. That is also strengthened by the fact the voice appeared more as my mental health decreased and that once I finally voiced that to another person, it appeared in my dreams. I hadn’t even thought of that day since freshman year and talking about the voice didn’t bring it up either, so I’m wondering if it was just my subconscious, or the thing itself.
