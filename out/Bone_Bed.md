Thinking back to that night I wonder what I could have done differently. Being a naive twelve-year-old I made a stupid, spur of the moment decision without thinking. The last 12 years of blame and self-hate have forced these memories to play on repeat. That being said, I think I’m finally ready to forgive myself and just remember him as he was. My best friend.

Every kid has the same fear on their first days of school. 'Will anyone want to be friends with me?' Sitting at the lunch table hours in, I was thinking the same. However, when a young dirty blonde-haired kid sat opposite me and complimented my bright blue dinosaur adorned lunch box, that all washed away.

Mason, likewise, was a Dino nut. Starting with our matching lunch boxes, a friendship blossomed that could and should have lasted a lifetime.

The days playing dinosaur disaster (a made-up dinosaur wrestling game) and nights watching old dino docs were the best days of our lives.

Our town sat just above an old prehistoric lake-bed deposit, which was home to an extension of the town. Due to the extremely high flood risk and past storms, the local council had deemed the area hazardous and off limits. As a result, the area had been left in a hurry, giving its shambled remains the image of a ghost town.

Its frankly dilapidated condition and its mystique had most local kids attempting to break in weekly. That being said, security was high, oddly too high for an area that was simply at risk of flooding. However, sadly for us, that area was home to the long-forgotten museum of prehistory and the object of our interest.

The plans we made up in Mason’s back garden tree house, could have seen us as world renowned paleontologists. Although, what we wanted more than anything was to get just a peak at the treasure trove laying, untouched in that valley.

We weren't bad kids; we listened to our parents’ warnings and understood why we couldn't go down to the lake-bed. Though, after years of fantasizing and opportunity arose in our first year at secondary school, that we couldn’t help but pounce at.

"You hear about that ghost town in Grey's Valley? Well apparently, Josh Browning is going to throw a lit party in a week. I don’t know how, but he’s found a way in."

The rumor mill churned as a revelation smacked me in the face as Mason charged down the hall, practically doing the same.

"Leah's going" he coughed between baited breaths. My puzzled luck, encouraging him to elaborate.

"She's going to Josh's party. Maybe we can go with her. You know down to the old town."

As we stared into each other’s eyes with hyperactive excitement, we knew this could be our only chance, so long as Mason’s sister would be cool with it. That evening as we sat in the tree-house, we hatched a plan.

We decided that we’d follow them down the valley and enter the exclusion zone just behind, out of sight. Using the mastermind excuse of ‘going to the movies with Leah’, we had our alibi. This also gave Leah the excuse to leave too, which she was happy to play along with. We’d decided not to spend too long as to not arouse any suspicion and be back within a couple of hours.

Checking the forecast, we were due some rain, though not until two days after. With it being early Autumn, we stupidly assumed that nothing would change, and we’d be in no danger from the elements.

That evening felt like an eternity to come, our eagerness causing every minute to feel like an hour. However, as it did, we saddled up our packs, mostly filled with torches, batteries and an encyclopedia of prehistoric animals, we were ready. Checking our watches as Leah took forever to get ready, we couldn’t contain our excitement.

Clambering into her small two door car, neither of us could stop smiling as Leah watched us through the rear-view mirror.

“Right, I don’t want to see you at the party. So, whatever it is you’re planning, do it as far from me as possible. Got that?” She demanded.

“Yes ma’am,” we joked as we saluted her from the back seats.

From our planned drop off point we stealthily waited and watched as the rowdy group of teens formed and then ventured through the broken fence. Though the forecast had said no rain, a couple of clouds loomed overhead, threatening to unload their contents. Giving a complimentary one-minute wait, we burst free from our hiding spot and began to embark on our adventure.

Somehow, Josh and his mates had found a section of the perimeter fence that was obstructed by a pair of small shrubs. With what we assumed were pliers, they snipped away a corner of the supports and used the surrounding foliage as a cover.

Following a short track way of trampled vegetation, we pushed through a thick mixture of fir and conifer trees on our descent, emerging around halfway down the slope. As we scanned the environment below, I caught the group ahead entering the town and making a right turn towards one of the larger buildings. 

The town wasn’t massive, maybe six or seven intact buildings, with a litter of half-submerged or collapsed structures sitting in the thick, but currently hard mud. Maybe only a foot wide, a set of snaking tributaries trickled in and out of the structures as they passed from right to left down the shallow decline of the lake-bed.

Reaching the end of the path, we hastily moved to our left, trying to avoid the main entrance and guard station sitting at the top of the valleys wall. On our venture we trudged passed a fire station, convenience store and collapsed gas station cover, to finally face the main entrance of the museum at the old towns end. Obviously, we’d seen photos, but actually standing there in person, we couldn’t hold back our excitement any longer. Mason darted for the doors, with me half a second behind him as we squirmed through the shattered doorway and into its interior.

Entering that damp, yet fairly undamaged building we surveyed our surroundings. Making our plan days prior, we set out a route that would allow us to see as much in as little time as possible, so long as we didn’t make any major detours. Whipping out his torch, Mason examined the printout of the map I had bound together into a crude booklet.

“Okay. No wasting time, let’s get to it, yeah?” Mason suggested as he pointed to the open doorway, which read in large red font, ‘Cenozoic Era.’

“Yeah, but let’s not be too reckless, this place isn’t all that put together anymore.” I didn’t want to waste time either, but something about the aged supports had me slightly on edge.

The hallway we entered had a large, long geological timeline which extended round the perimeter walkways leading to each exhibit. For a while we simply followed the dim damp corridor, rays of sunlight revealing our path as they peaked through the broken clerestory windows. 

Occasionally we would enter any small exhibits and take some arguably out of focus photos on Mason’s short digital camera. The soft scraping of stone and creaking of wet wood lingered as we ventured through. Though we wouldn’t be picky with what we got to see, our main focus was the Mesozoic section and its array of dinos.

Exiting that section and stepping into a wide room, a tangle of foliage, moss and what looked and definitely smelt like mold covered the tall walls and wrapped around the cracked staircase ahead of us. A collapsed section of the wall and upper floor piled up, blocking the doorway to our left and leaving us with two options. Beams of light extending from the holes in the roof, illuminated the three signs sitting on each wall of the room in front of us. From left to right, ‘Gifts – Cafeteria’, ‘Mesozoic Era – Paleozoic Era’ and ‘Movie Hall’.

“Sam, wanna actually see a movie?” Mason chuckled as he pointed and turned his head towards me.

As he spoke, we collectively heard the faint, yet distinct sound of people talking.

“What was …” Shushing Mason as I tilted an ear and strained to listen again, those were definitely voices and there were at least a couple of them.

Slowly and hesitantly, I guided Mason over to the slightly a-jar ‘Movie Hall’ door, with my finger pressed to my lips. Delicately peaking around its corner, I scanned the auditorium to see a group of people standing around the front row of seats. Fixating on each person one-by-one I quickly realized one of the taller girls was Leah, and this was her group.

“Ewww Josh, these seats are all wet, where are we supposed to sit?” and “Toss me another, this place blows.” One girl droned on in an obnoxious tone as the guys in the group cracked open another can.

“Well then, guess we’re not going in here, are we? Don’t wanna upset the big boss.” Mason jokingly whispered again as we wound our necks in and turned to the staircase.

“Thought they were supposed to be partying? This is definitely not the type of place Leah would hang … unless she’s trying to pull?” Mason’s sarcastic wink, solidifying why I was his only friend.

“How’d they get in? You think there’s a back entrance somewhere? I questioned, but Mason had already started ascending the broken staircase.

Stepping foot on those weak panels didn’t fill me with confidence, as their pained grouses only added to the buildings settling noises.

Reaching the top we both stood in awe as we gazed upon the objects of our infatuation. Standing ahead was the largest collection of dinosaur animatronics and statues in our county. 

Surprisingly, what caught our attention first was a jumbled mess of bones, some connected to the supporting wires, but most laying, cluttered on the granular floor. A Frankenstein’s monster of multiple dinosaur species stared us in the face, though there was no name or description panel. Trying to concentrate on the creature, I couldn’t tell if it was just a jumbled mess caused by the crumbling exhibit or it had been made that way.

The audible click of magnetic limbs drew me up to see Mason adding an ‘average’ sized rib bone to the stout Carnotaurus skull in a phallic design. Chuckling to one another Mason jumped down and passed me into the main bulk of the room, however my eyes didn’t follow at first. They were almost transfixed on the skeleton. Something about its disjointed proportions and angular frame made me uneasy. It seemed to jerk ever so slightly, chalking it up to wind or the recent meddling of Masons, my engagement was quickly broken as he called for me to follow.

Walking the exhibit, with interspersed flashes of a camera, we couldn’t have been more vindicated for actually coming down that evening. I don’t know how long we spent, but we must have meticulously examined and debated each sculptures accuracy and ‘coolness’, as Mason put it.

“Mate … that Gnathosaurus is well weird, look at its crest. What are we saying, a top 10 dino?

As Mason took another snap, I couldn’t help myself but interject, regardless of how cringe I would have sounded then and still do now.

“That’s a pterosaur not a dinosaur actually, but yeah, its 100% a top 10.”

Not all the sculptures were unscathed buy the withering of time. Though most were just slightly water damaged, a couple of headless Raptors definitely made up for the unfortunate crumpled piles of plastic and fabric. Similarly, with the absence of electrical connections, all but one of the animatronics actually made a sound. Though, it could be compared to wheezing rather than the original vocalizations.

We’d easily spent more time than planned there, but striding into the ‘Cretaceous exhibition, we finally gazed up at its centerpiece. A hulking titan loomed over us as we stood, marveling at the Tyrannosaurus.

“He’s a big boy, isn’t he? Mason really had a way with words.

“How about you put your head in his mouth, and I’ll take a photo?” I knew he’d ask me, so I quickly got my question in first.

Smiling, somehow he seemed game and with little push back, quickly positioned himself below the behemoth. His head rising closer and closer to its maw as the image put into perspective how small we really were in comparison.

Lunging forward, a distorted, broken crackling roar bellowed from the slack jawed therapod, as the scraping, scratching of carbon fiber bones echoed in unison. Its suddenality sent Mason flying backwards to the floor, like a startled cat and caused me to become paralyzed in place. The gap between Mason’s head and the jagged rows of teeth as it jerked had been so small, for an instant it seemed as if he would have been swallowed up by the animatronic.

Looking at the now slumped T.rex and then back at each other, laughter broke out, though it was strained and faked. Mason’s eyes hollow and extremely wide as the beast rocked back to its original position, the near miss must have put into perspective how dangerous of a situation we were really in. Our stunned silence was complimented by the absence of settling noises and the emergence of a soft dripping overhead.

Sitting on the exhibition floor a small drip of water hit the back of my neck and slithered down my shirt, causing me to squirm in place. My head slowly tilted upwards as another droplet hit me square in the face. It was dark, no longer the dim afternoon but the early evening. As the grey clouds thickened, raindrops gradually beat through the opening in the ceiling, causing me to realize we’d been here too long.

Turning to Mason, I was about to tell him we didn’t have much time left, but he hadn’t moved. His gaze was no longer on the T.rex but locked in on something out of my sight. Nudging him forcefully, his eyes never lost their laser like focus.  

“What? Mason, what is it?”

“Sam, where did that skeleton go?” His voice trembled like a young child getting reprimanded by a parent.

“What?” I questioned as my eyes filtered around the legs and fake shrubs of the dinosaur’s podium.

The section was empty.

“Did it fall over or through the floor maybe?” They were empty suggestions as I knew we’d have seen or heard something.

The distinct change of his mood and body language had me on edge too. However, before I could open my mouth to ask for us to leave, voices came from the floor below.

Scrambling to our feet, we rounded one of the display walls and peered over the bent catwalk barrier. Leah’s group were downstairs in the cafeteria wandering the pealing floorboards and overturned tables.

Questioning whether I should tell her we were leaving or just buck it out of there now, a shout came from one of the large unhinged double metal doors, leading down to the basement. I couldn’t make it out, but whatever it was, it pushed the group into action as they hastily followed the sound.

With a foe bravado, Mason’s voice emerged from my right.

“Maybe we should see what the fuss is about, this can be the last thing before we dip.”

Nodding, regardless of the small pocket of fear welling within, we searched for the makeshift entrance they’d used to get into the cafeteria. With no luck, Mason pointed out a slab of collapsed wall below us, creating a sudo ramp from the second to first floor. It definitely wasn’t fully stable, but with our only other option to track back to the main entrance, we ventured down. Effortlessly, Mason hung from the catwalk barrier and lowered himself feet first onto the slab, sliding down to the floor. However, somehow I managed to lose my grip and fall a short distance, back first onto the slab, slumping down to the floor in a heap.

It was painful but didn’t hamper me too much initially, mostly due to the adrenaline and my desire to end our little excursion. As I slowly propped myself up on one of the overturned tables, Mason stretched out a hand beckoning me to take it and rise to my feat.

The basement was pitch black, mostly due to the absence of a light source down in its depths. With a slight nod of solidarity, we clicked on our torches, barely cutting through the dense, moist air and descended the thick stone stairs.

Following the quiet chatter, we stepped through a thin layer of water which blanketed the basements stone floor as we advanced. From simple storage to half damaged sculptures and props, the rooms were collectively home to that ever prominent green and black mold, infesting the building. 

Finally, we saw the group as they entered a room filled with early human mannequins. Evidently this was what they had found so enthralling. Poking and jesting at their proportions and clothes, the gaggle of late teens frisked through the room’s items. Backing away slowly and moving to an unoccupied room we simultaneously stopped, in a sudden realization.

A beige sandy platform lingered at its back wall, illuminated in our torchlight. Stepping closer, the labelled panel read: ‘Skeletosaurous’, 'a selection of the most famous composites for any avid paleontologist to craft a wild new creature.'

“Is this where that thing was supposed to be?” His voice trembled as it had in front of the Tyrannosaurus.

“I don’t know. But where is it now?” My tone paralleling his growing fears.

“Skeletons don’t just get up and walk around, do they? It’s not nightmare at the museum.” His fake chuckle didn’t mask his true thoughts.

My response wouldn’t come, as a raspy scratching sound echoed from deeper within the elaborate and dark rooms. As it did, it was followed by a chorus of screams and the distinct sound of frenzied panic. Scrambling across the open doorway a portion of the group dashed away to the basement staircase. 

Whatever their pursuer was, we didn’t want to find out, however as we turned a shooting sharp pain planted itself in my lower back. That fall hadn’t left me unscathed. I knew I wouldn’t be getting out with any haste and as we stared at each other, a silent decision was made.

Grabbing and half dragging, half crutching me to a section of pallets deeper in the right of the room, we planted ourselves and held our breath. Trying our best to stay silent we waited. That dragging scraping sound mixed with the moving, settling of the building came from the room ahead. Whatever was creating it was large, but not whole. 

The sound of clicking and dangling pieces of a hard, stone-like material bounced off the walls and the other components of its mass. Although, mixed in with those inanimate sounds, were the dripping, squelching noises of a living thing. Whatever was being dragged across the wet stone floor was wheezing and faintly panting as if it were clinging to life, only barely. Each step on the entities asymmetric digits sent a short ripple of water. Every ice-cold wave beat at our back as we sat there motionless. Neither of us dare turn to look, in fear of revealing our makeshift hiding spot.

We must have sat there in complete silence until we couldn’t hear anything, then waited some more. Though we didn’t want to wait long enough for whatever that was to come back, our movements were braised as if wrapped in a strait jacket. By that time, we’d acclimated to the cold water and hadn’t even noticed that it had risen from ankle level to knee level. The strained sound of thunder snapped Mason from his trance.

“It’s flooding, we’ve got to go”, I whispered into his ear as to not illicit any attention.

“Let’s go, I … I’m … ready to go now” Mason squeaked, the fear palpable in his weary voice.

Traversing those rooms felt like a horror game. Each corner was a potential jump scare lingering in the pitch-black maze of museum relics. Reaching the base of the staircase, streams of water gushed down, steadily converting the once damp basement into a deep abyss. 

Ascending with care, we prayed nothing would rear its head and blockade our only exit. Stepping in a panic with too much force, my foot hit a soaked mossy patch masked by the onrushing waterfall as my footing gave way. The fall stole my breath as I plunged back into the rising water table. With a gasp that could have swallowed all the air in the room I broke free of the surface tension. Staring up at Mason, his silhouette juxtapose to the faint moonlight peering through the opening above. His spotlight fixed on me as I struggled to push myself back onto my knees.

“Sam, you good mate?” Masons voice was harsh as he attempted to call down without alerting anything.

“Arh … my knee. Help me up, please.” This situation had me feeling like a helpless child, which right there, kneeling in the flooded basement, I was.

In the fall my torch had disappeared under the deepening current, though not at the forefront of my mind as we attempted to climb out for a second time.

His outstretched hand, grasping my shoulder and heaving me up as I barely put one foot in front of the other on our ascent. Breaking free from the darkness, we could tell that we were in a very dire situation. Water was surging in from every possible inlet, dragging anything that wasn’t tied down back to the museums cracking back wall. If we weren’t more careful, we could end up following the impending opening of the floodgates, pulling us downstream.

Searching the slowly imploding room, we tried to locate the doorway back to the main entrance, although in our horror we both turned to see it had caved in, leaving no safe way to exit.

“Where’s the door gone, how are we going to get out, what now?” I whimpered, as Mason shook me and divulged his plan for our escape.

“Check your map Sam, there must be a staff area or something with a back door.”

Distressingly however, the fall had soaked my backpack and its contents, leaving the map no more then a damp scrap.

“Okay, okay … we can still do this, we need to find a way back to the Cenozoic exhibit, where we came in.” His voice, returning to that enthusiastic tone he’d used earlier. Maybe it was to comfort me or just to psych himself up, but I was ready.

At that time with the falling debris and increased water level, a small section of the catwalk we’d previously been stood on had dropped, allowing us to access it if we gained a small amount more height.

“Mason, if we move a table or two, we can jump back into the railing from the second floor, look!” My outstretched arm pointing to our hopeful salvation.

“Yeah, I think that will…” His statement was cut off, by a sound that sent a shiver up our spine, colder than the surrounding water.

As parts of the building fell, splashing in the rising water level, another fainter sound could be heard between the rumbles of thunder. The scraping sound. Whatever it was originated from, was still inside.

“Sam, you work on the table. I’ll keep an eye out and watch your back.” His voice remained firm as the cone of light from his torch extended out into the wide room behind us.

The torch only just lighting a pale white flicker. Its disjointed figure lurched out of sight once more, dragging what seemed to be the upper half of one of the mannequins.

“Sam, lets get a move on.” His voice growing more frantic as I could see the torch light flick across the rooms perimeter.

Hobbling over to a round table, I tried to use my body weight to leaver it up onto my back so I could carry it, however as I did a section of wall gave way and a blast of water sent be to my knees. Interspersed between breaths I called out for Mason as he tried his hardest to keep track of our stalker.

“I can’t, were going to have to do it together.”

I knew Mason didn’t want to take his eyes from the rest of the room, but with a short, vicious ‘fuck’ under his breath, he swiveled, and collectively we mounted the tables.

Like mice running from a cat, we scaled that unstable platform and scrambled up to the second floor as fast as we could, fighting the urge to look back as those scraping sounds drew closer. Darting, slipping and fleeing across the second-floor exhibit, we passed the things that had excited us so much, now only relegated to obstacles blocking our escape.

Stopping at the top of the staircase, a riptide beat against its supports as debris and steps flowed down hitting the weakening back wall. As we hesitated at the top, the unmistakable sound of a raspy, broken T.rex roar emanated from back within the exhibit. Only one thought shot through our minds as we knew, what had activated its sensors.

Pushing me upfront as my lower body began to fatigue, Mason’s head doubled back, as to ascertain our pursuer.

“Right, don’t worry about that, just take it slowly and don’t put too much weight on the steps, they’re practically falling off.” His goading hand signals leading me down the dilapidated structure.

“Look there, the raised podiums. Just get on them and we’ll be okay.” His encouraging words driving back the talons of nausea that were embedded within me, preventing any semblance of rationality.

Traversing the stairs, each platform creaked and cracked on my descent, leading me to make a stupid, reckless mistake. In hysterics at the looming sounds from the second floor, I quickly hopped down the last three, disregarding Mason’s earlier statement. Shattering under my weight, their splintered remains rapidly flowed down to the back wall. That must have been the final straw as, the moment they collided with the mound of debris, the back wall collapsed sending the river of rubble hurtling down stream at a breakneck pace.

Staring out at the rapids, many of the previously seen buildings were flowing away in the writhing channel that had formed.

Mason followed suit, painstakingly clambering down as far as possible. Planting himself on the last available step and bracing himself, something above caught his eye as they widened to the size of footballs. Mealy for a fleeting moment, I caught a fragment of what he was seeing. Its broken frame limping as it dragged its numerous appendages and joints with an uncanny ferocity. Flicking back down to me, I could see the fear welling up within as he was forced to make a leap of faith.

The moment hung in the air for an eternity as he flung himself towards me, arms outstretched. My disregard earlier forcing him to make an impossible leap. In my fear of falling to the waves, I didn’t inch closer to the edge, only reach a hand, which scarcely bridged the gap between us. His body was frozen there in mid air as our fingertips touched. All the while our eyes were locked on one another. However, eternity passed as his body dropped, plunging into the torrent. Its cold grasp, ensnaring him and wrenching his body under.

For a moment I was stunned to silence, not moving and disregarding the writhing clawing sounds above me. Whether I was hopefully searching for a sign he was alright or just expecting the creature to slump down and devour me I froze. In a moment, my world had crumbled as the structure around me imploded and fell to ruin.

I expected to be chewed out by the line of parents and officers who’d congregated at the embankment in front of the main entrance. Honestly in that moment I was too focused on getting help for Mason to care what they’d say as multiple men forcefully wrenched me back to the safety of the valley wall. 

My naivety and panic only left the adults with solemn looks as they grasped the situation, something I wasn’t able to process. My pleas only falling on deaf ears as there was nothing any of them could do.

I dreaded the conversation with Masons parents. Martha’s bloodcurdling wails as she fell to the floor and the dejected, sorrowful look in Roberts eyes only fed the spiraling abyss in my stomach, as it engulfed me. Mirroring their pitiful situation was another couple, I’d later find out was one of Leah’s friend’s parents. Curled up in a ball, their quiet sobs being drowned out by the downpour, which washed away any trace of their only child.

Leah never told me what she and her friends saw, let alone what happened to Tommy. I can make an educated guess, but evidently, she’s repressed those memories like most from that group, all except Josh. Lots of people still blame him, none more so than Leah’s parents, but looking back, he was just like me, excited to spend time with his friends.

Whatever it was, that thing in the basement, no-ones heard about it since. Looking back at old documents and photos of the museum when it was fully operational, there wasn’t even a mention of an exhibit with any large scale skeletons in. The tiny glimpse I got in the reflection of Mason’s eye, is enough for me. I don’t need the full picture to get closure. Although, regardless of the power mother nature commands, I doubt that synthetic beast was quelled so easily. 

Weeks, months went by with me confining myself to exile in my room. I’d hoped my parents would hate me or disown me for disobeying them, but they just pitied my situation as I felt sorry for myself. For a while hating myself just became the norm.

It’s taken me a long time to come to terms with what happened and with no bodies ever being found, closure is hard to come by. However, with this story I think I’m finally able to look past my mistake and stop this spiral of self-loathing.

What spurred me on to this was us moving out and throwing away a lot of my old childhood things. That dinosaur lunchbox forced my recollection and has given me the motivation to move on. I’ve applied and been accepted into the Oxford University on a Geology and Paleontology degree, and by God I’m going to be the world’s greatest paleontologist, not just for myself, but for Mason.
