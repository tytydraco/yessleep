I am not sure what is wrong with me, but for almost my whole life I have played with death in my dreams and imaginations. It comes in on‑and‑off phases. At this point, I am not even sure whether it was me playing with death or death toying with me.

Most nights for the last many years, I have dreamed about my death in several ways. I have imagined it approaching me in some *Final Destination* way, as if my death has been craftily engineered by God—messy, fleshy, body‑splattering.

My favorite imagination, or maybe a dream, is the one where my body is lying on a road covered with coal and copper.  
A fleet of huge lorries approaches my body, line by line.  
My body wakes up only to face the gigantic tires of those heavy machines, tire by tire.  
The fleet crosses over my face, pain by pain.  
My body—conscious. Shivering in excruciating pain. My face—a flat, hot mash of brain, bone, and blood.

At some point in my long life, I dreamt this, and I imagined this. I replayed it, again and again, just like that fleet, in a perfect time‑sliced sequence.

Do not think I am crazy; there is a reason for this wild imaginative exercise. At one point in my life, I was suicidal. Angry father, self‑victimizing mother, two pinches of adultery, and a full tablespoon of dysfunctionality, baked together into sweet trauma brownies. Somehow, the innovation in imagining my death calmed me. Younger me thought death should be grander—if not morally, then at least visually mesmerizing. Ironically, this idea, set against the idea of a normal, boring suicide, made me feel as if I had conquered the fear of death. Or at least, that is what I believed back then.

Back then, I binged gore videos from old Reddit and 4chan to calm myself. The idea of desensitizing myself from death tranquilized me in the strangest way.  
If I could imagine my death, I could overcome death. I held general‑body meetings with my imaginations to choose the most innovative version of my own demise. My fascination with my death kept brewing until it became some kind of obsession.

I wove numerous stories around my death: from a fatal car crash on a busy highway to falling into a sea of icicles. All the versions of my inner voices presented a new narrative of death to me. It was a parliament of narratives, and I, as the general secretary, had to choose the best death. I spent hours filtering them, indulging in each narrative, trying to feel the pain from every single one so I could decide which death was perfect.

And no, I was not the supreme leader of this thought‑kingdom. It worked more like a democratized hive mind. There was a well‑established dialogue between me and my voices. Each voice would narrate its story to me, I would indulge in it, think and feel it thoroughly, and then send that voice to the bench. I repeated the same with the others until I had heard them all. After some critical thinking, I would present my choice, and all the voices were allowed to counter it. Sometimes, they even edited my choice to make it better.

I created a whole universe around death narratives just to calm myself. Every session felt like meditation. I felt rejuvenated, more energetic, in a strangely delightful mood. This came with one demerit, though.

The slightest inconvenience would sometimes send me running back into those sessions just to calm myself. At one point, I felt addicted to the exercise.

On the brighter side, I kept writing down the best ones. I kept editing the filtered ones that showed potential, sharpening the storylines to make them better. This creative exercise not only made me a better writer, but it also compelled me to read more about gory deaths, explore them, dissect them, digest them. I explored themes from erotic deaths to cosmic, peaceful ones—the kind of gore where not just the body but the soul shatters, where the *self* breaks into smithereens.

I grew more obsessed with imagining death. Like some drug, it held me, healed me, and stitched me back into a whole—only to make me crave it more.

But I did not know the reality of death. I had never seen any kind of death at that time. A rendezvous with Death brings peace, but not without causing a disaster first.

In the physical realm, I have had three interventions with death. Each time, I felt less of myself and more of… *everything else*.

The first encounter goes six years back. I was a troubled college kid imagining his deaths to calm his nerves. I was going home from college by train. There were flights available, yet I chose the train to give myself time to prepare for the old traumas waiting back home. College life had liberated me. I still thought of innovative deaths, and the need to calm myself had grown more intense, more frequent. I tried therapy, counseling, psychiatry multiple times only to deduce my coping mechanism is the best one.

Home has the power to bring back the older version of you. You can leave home, but home never leaves the last version of you that inhabited it.

I watched distant villages slide by the window as the train left stations one by one, racing time and swiftly approaching my hometown. Five more stations to go. I stared at the reverse‑speeding trees, lost in the thought of how chaotic a train derailment would look. My nerves were not calming. My heart was racing against the train now. My imagination jumped from one narrative to another—from a suicide bombing inside the train to multiple‑train collisions.

Suddenly, the train screeched to a halt in a barren, deserted area with no one visible outside. Just a few miles from my station.

Oblivious to everything, I was reaching for my water bottle when I heard a huge commotion just outside my berth window. I stepped out of my coach to find Death manifested, directly below my berth.

It was a suicide on the railway tracks. A man’s body split open. Spilled. Everywhere on the track. The train had obliterated his whole face. Brain here, hands there. Legs outside the rails. Whatever remained just lay there like some sick, twisted modern art.

In that loud commotion, I saw the divine Death laughing at the sad corpse, drenching it with his nothingness. My body started to go numb. I stood there, at rest yet shivering with fear of that presence.

A white‑clad organism. Black nothingness shimmering around his outline, warping the space around him. Spherical, except for the millions of protrusions: a spiky, heavy ball with only a tongue and teeth. He could see only when his teeth moved. Restless. His tongue made swirling movements around his teeth in no apparent pattern. Relentless.

From the way people were reacting, it was clear that no one except me could see him, so I knew my mind was creating that entity. People howled over the man’s pitiful death, and my face wore a serene smile. Even watching death was painful, but in an anesthetic way.

After witnessing this, I was changed. Not entirely—just a tiny part of my brain felt damaged, corrupted. My soul grew a few black stains. My brain could not let go of that godly abomination.

Following this encounter, my voices automatically submitted to that image. My parliament of thoughts transformed into a dictatorship, ruled by the divine.

Death started visiting me in my dreams. I kept waking up only to find that image again in my thoughts. In every dream and in every thought, it was there.

The white blob of infinite brightness, yelling at me. His tongue still swirling around his teeth, he screamed the clear, deep words of his question:

*How do you imagine yourself dying?*

*How… do you imagine yourself dying?*

*Tell me how.*

*Now*.

Weirdly, his face stayed dry even with that unruly tongue swirling all over it—dry enough that the distinction between hot and cold blurred. His words did not cut; they pierced through the skin of my face. With every swirl, my skin felt more scraped.

He stopped his interrogation only when he found my replies creative.  
He liked the funny ones. Rarely liked the anticlimactic ones. He smiled widely at the gory ones. He often seemed intrigued by the sad ones. And he absolutely despised the AI‑generated horseshit I tried to make; his wordless rage then scraped not just my skin but the entire space I existed in. It was so frightening that I stopped all interaction with any LLM platforms.

He never gave verbal feedback. He showed me little quirks of satisfaction and then dispersed, only to come back when I needed him for the same thing again.

For the first year, I will not lie, I felt like a ghostwriter working for him. Not unpaid, though. I was paid in tranquility—in the very essence of calm.

Suddenly, my obsession with death became a devotion. I realized the difference between calm and serenity. With that divine thing I conjured, I felt serene. Home finally felt like home again. My trauma could not hurt me the same way. I was whole, bound together by the threads of narratives that Death asked me to write.

Even the frequency of this imaginative exercise reduced. Each session felt overwhelmingly serene, so I assumed my mind had started limiting this kind of consumption on its own.

I felt grateful to the divine for bringing me closer to my family. Yet I felt more otherworldly than familial. It is hard to articulate. It was like a drug that made me feel whole without overindulgence. Every session felt like praying. All my faith crumbled and re‑formed into a single belief: Death was the ultimate religion.

“Near‑death experience” might be the closest phrase for that serene feeling. I was already close to Death anyway, and I was experiencing this habitually.

I even created stories around him. I always felt he was an organism burdened—probably by the constant work of engineering deaths. I felt the divinity of his work in his commanding questions and screams. His abrasive tongue felt like a godly purgatory made just for me.

His physicality inside my mind seemed hollow yet heavy. Everything and nothing coming together at the same time. Monochromatic. Extreme. Harsh. Yet blissful. A chaotic calmness. Divine.

For four straight years, I believed this was a fallacy of my mind—something I had conjured to cope with a disorder even psychiatrists failed to categorize.

A divine fallacy woven by me, for me. A selfish conjuring. I would have been content to keep relishing this pious poise for the rest of my life.

Until the second encounter with Death happened.
