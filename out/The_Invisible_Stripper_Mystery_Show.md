I was excited to be living in the big city of Los Angeles. I had moved in a week earlier but was still busy with getting myself properly settled. So, I had no time to make new friends or look around. On this particular Friday evening, I had just replied to the last of the emails when I suddenly realized I was starving.

I’m not the kind of guy that likes eating stuff outside since I knew how to prepare most of my favorite dishes. But tonight, I was willing to go out and let someone else do the cooking. After all, what’s the harm in stepping out of my lane for an hour or two? Fifteen minutes later, I was strolling down the streets in search of where I could get something tasty and healthy. Despite not wanting to take junk, I was willing to do some alcohol tonight.

The streets were bubbling with life as several young couples idled around in the distance, with many others bustling and chattering around. The streets were all lit up with light seeping through glass doors, walls, and windows of shopping malls and grocery stores. Now, this was a whole different scenery compared to my little town, back home in Cambodia, where most people had already retired indoors, leaving the streets to stray pets and a few other people who were returning home late from work.

After second thoughts, I decided to use the opportunity to take in the scenery and also familiarize myself with the surrounding. For the third time, I looked at my watch. It read 7:25 P.M. I knew I had to be home on or before 10 o’clock. So, that was it! I had over two full hours to eat and have fun, maybe meet new people and make new friends.

A few blocks from where I was, a spectacular banner with outstanding neon lighting caught my eye. It read: ***The invisible stripper.*** For half a minute, I forgot about the churning in my stomach. Now that was a really interesting feature. *How could a stripper possibly be invisible?* I stopped to read down. Close to the bottom right corner of the banner were the time and date. The show was set to begin at 8 PM. For some reason, I was grateful I had about thirty minutes to fill my stomach and find a sit inside the club hall before the party began.

At exactly 7:56, I had just finished a dinner of spaghetti and grilled chicken and was a few feet past the security check at the front door of the club. The interior of the club was dimly-lit with a handful of neon light strips here and there, giving the building some sort of tense ambiance. The lighting was such that you could hardly recognize a person 3 feet in front of you.

There were more than a hundred other men already seated in the hall when I entered. Luckily, I found a sit in the third row from the stage where I was sure I’d be able to see everything that needed to be seen. Quickly, I set an alarm for 9:30, then double-checked to see if I got extra cash just in case watching a stripper had its typical effect on me. Hopefully, there should be several ladies who were here for aroused men. *Spending a few dollars on a prostitute shouldn’t be too much damage.* At least she was going to keep me distracted from the severe insomnia I'd been battling since I arrived in L.A.

There was R&B-type music playing in the background, reminding me of the good old days. A few minutes later, half a dozen puppeteers with black flowing tunics scurried onto the stage and stood with their backs facing the audience. The curtains in the background were black. Moments later, the stage lights came on, revealing long colorful socks and gloves, high heels, panties, and a bra. They were all perfectly aligned that they assumed the shape of an actual female stripper. The roar that erupted from the men now seated in the theater was enough to drown a referee's whistle.

Almost immediately, the music volume was turned to its peak, and the music changed to a preset song for the performance. The puppeteers were now moving their hands and feet as they skillfully manipulated the invisible stripper into a dance. The event was like nothing I had ever seen, whoever these puppeteers were, they must be the best at what they did. For about an hour, I watched as these men expertly manipulated the form on stage in different captivating dance moves. The performance was so captivating that I literally forgot that there were other men seated in the hall with me, my eyes were completely riveted on the stage.

For a moment, I thought I caught myself nodding in a half-sleep. I was surprised as it was quite unlikely that I fell asleep that early or so easily. Plus, my body system wasn’t supposed to find such a noisy environment conducive enough to fall asleep. I glanced over at my watch, it was 9:02. Then something else caught my eye, the man to my right was fast asleep and so was the man next to him. I looked to my left and noticed the same thing. As far as my eyes could reach, everyone was sleeping. It seemed strange but I dismissed the thought, concluding that they were probably too drunk. Then I returned my attention to the stage.

The stripper figure was still dancing when from behind the curtain a long pitch-black hand appeared, stretching into the audience in my direction. The hand stopped somewhere beside me, to my right, then returned back behind the curtains. It all happened in a split second. When I turned to see where the hand had stopped, the sleeping man on the seat next to me was nowhere to be found. The hand had snatched him!

Suddenly, the crowd that previously appeared to be sleeping erupted in a thunderous clap. Everyone was now wide awake, including me. Slowly a chill ran down my spine, leaving my whole body engulfed in goosebumps. Looking back on stage, everything appeared to be normal. Then I noticed something that I didn’t see before. The breeze from the fans made one of the puppeteers' tunics sway widely. For a moment, it looked like there was nobody wearing the clothes. For a while I observed the other puppeteers and my fears were confirmed: there was nobody on stage!

I was finding it hard to believe I and everyone else in the hall had just been hypnotized as I crawled through in-between the rows and columns of seats towards the exit. Whoever owned the hand that emerged from backstage had staged a hypnosis show in the guise of a stripper performance and was slowly consuming his audience. Thirty minutes later, I was lying on my back in bed imagining the fate of the hand’s victim. Silently, I swore never to attend any event that appeared too extraordinary as I slowly drifted to sleep.
