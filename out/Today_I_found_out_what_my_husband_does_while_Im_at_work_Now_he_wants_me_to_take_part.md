“Hey!” the doormat crunched under my feet as I disengaged from my left suede loafer, “Still up for that trip to the mall?”

My voice hung in the air, seemingly unwilling to venture through the apartment.

“HelloOo,” I tried again, clearing my throat, “Matt?”

The guttural creak of the bed springs gave him away. I made my way towards the bedroom.  Matthew was no stranger to the occasional snooze. A respite from the weariness of his work-from-home routine. Phone-in-hand, he’d lounge against the bed frame in his linen drawstrings, contending with Reddit’s Banana counter, boxes of half-eaten Chinese tandoori strewn across my side of the bedspread.

I stuck my head in, narrowing my eyes to assess whether the tandoori had made it onto the sateen sheets, but something about the way he sat perched on the edge of the bed, knuckling the mattress on either side of his torso made me stop in my tracks. Strands of ash brown hair lay slick against his perspiring temples, frantic eyes sweeping the carpeted interior as though for some overlooked evidence.

A ripple of goosebumps coursed down my spine, “*Mattie?* What’s the matter?” 

He swept his palm across the back of his neck, pursing his lips. Sprawling sweat stains marred the underarms of his charcoal Henley.

“Nothing. Just a nightmare,” his voice was barely a whisper, raspy and thick, “You’re home early?”

“Yeah, I…” I forced a sigh of relief, although my feet remained anchored to the doorway, “I hit my weekly coffee quota. *Well*, according to Niamh anyway, so she let me off early.”

But Matthew’s expression was impassive, like carved stone. I hesitated, attempting to curl my toes around the aluminum threshold, “Are you *sure* you’re okay?”

“*What?* Oh, yeah. Yeah! *Totally,*” except he wouldn’t meet my gaze. 

“Well, wanna go to the mall?”

My husband’s deadpan expression contorted into one of agitation, “Erm, actually, would you mind going on your own? I’m actually not fee- um, actually, yeah just go. My wallet’s on the kitchen counter, help yourself, yeah?”

I hesitated, “Didn’t you want to see the new Marvel movie, the one about the Black… *Window?*”

He seemed too perturbed to correct me.

“*Hello?* Earth to Matthew?” I snapped twice as though trying to reboot whatever mental software had malfunctioned, “I only offered because *you* wanted to go. I have no business at the mall.”

He watched in silence as I crossed the room to my side of the bed and plopped down on it, absently picking at a fresh blister on my ankle. *Honestly, whoever invented loafers-*

“What are you doing?” the alarm in his tone made my skin prickle.

“Yeah, I should probably slap a BandAid on it, eh? Can you *believe* I bought these shoes before Christmas last year?”

He said nothing, so I shifted my focus away from the scab and turned to face him. He was staring right at me, expression tight, like he’d already lived the conversation we were about to have.

“No, I mean,” his voice suddenly gruff, “What are you doing *here?*”

I blinked, unsure if I’d heard correctly. He picked up on my apprehension.

“I mean…” he swallowed, fingering the sateen geometric print, leaving dark sweat smears across the fabric, “I mean, don’t you wanna do that… Well, y’know, in the bathroom? Like, in the shower, perhaps?”

Tucking a strand of rogue hair behind my left ear, I murmured, “No, but you definitely need one. Jeez, Matt, you reek! And look at the bedsheets! I only replaced them last night, and now they’re all…”

I gestured with my hands, hoping they would somehow convey what words couldn’t. Now that I’d had a chance to look around, the bedroom was a downright mess. 

“Is it really that hard to *not* leave your dirty socks lying around?” sighing, I heaved myself off the bed to collect them, as I always did, “-and on the windowsill, next to the orchid, *seriously?*”

A beat of silence passed before Matthew finally spoke.

“Actually… Those are yours. Found them in the bathroom this morning.” He paused, then added with a shrug, “Thought I’d, y’know, *stow them away* for you.”

Turning my back to him, I fingered the grubby white cotton. The socks were definitely too small for my husband’s foot-galore, but the blisters on my own were proof enough I hadn’t been wearing any.

My mother’s classic *“Once a cheater, always a cheater”* rang in my head. I shrugged it off. Not now. The circumstances under which we’d met were not important. After all, I was nothing like that bitch Janine. She used to knock back Actimels like they were tap water and flat-out refused to wax her upper lip - a tragic combo, really.

“On the windowsill?” I attempted a snarky smile.

Matt shrugged, “Delivery guy rang. Must’ve set them down and forgotten about them.”

His phone lit up. He snatched it and swiped “decline” before I could glimpse the name.

“Just work… Henry, the new department head. Always on my case.” His voice was steady, but his expression betrayed him - wild, bewildered, as though his nightmare was creeping up on him again.

“Well shouldn’t you answer it? Sounds like it might be important.”

“Later,” he said, each syllable sharp-edged and final, “It’s lunchtime, isn’t it? Look, Isla, you don’t need to stay on my account. I’ll nap a bit, get some work done. Really, go see Black Widow.”

I stared at him, silent and reproachful. 

“Or, y’know… a new pair of shoes? Your feet look like they could use them.”

“Actually,” I clasped my hands together in a *let’s-get-things-done* kind of way, “How about we clean up a little first? Can you toss your takeout in the trash, while I change the sheets and crack the window?”

The silence dragged a little too long. Matt’s face twisted, agitation settling in like a second skin.

“No,” he licked his chapped lips, “No, look, I made this mess, I’ll clean it.”

I rolled my eyes. Matt’s definition of ‘cleaning’ was shoving everything under the bed. That’s why we got a bed with built-in storage in the first place. Any time he attempted to change the sheets, it turned into a game of ‘find the blanket’, and I was always the loser, spending half the night freezing my butt off in the blanket-less gaps.

“Let’s just clean it together, okay? You do the tandoori, I’ll do the re-”

“Can you just *fucking* leave?” his voice was sharp and venomous, “I need some space, some time to think. I don’t want to clean right now, I’ll do it later, *understand?*”

I swallowed, “Look, this is my home too. You can’t just decide where I’m supposed to be whenever you need space. If you want alone time this much, maybe *you* should head to the mall, and I’ll stay here.”

Illustrating my point, I flopped back onto the bed, shoved the pillow against the headboard, and leaned into it, “In fact, maybe *I’ll* take a nap.”

For a moment, Matthew looked like he wanted to hit me. No, he looked as though I’d hit *him*! His fingers trembled, a thick vein bulging in his temple. With a few sharp, jerky movements, he sank onto his pillow, eyes fixated on the ceiling. I could see the frantic rise and fall of his chest beneath the blanket.

“Mattie, what’s the matter..?” I tried once more, only to be met with silence. 



\*\*\*



I was jolted awake to the weight of my husband’s thick fingers digging into my shoulders. His flushed, sweat-slicked face loomed inches from mine.  He’d already managed to maneuver both of my legs to his side of the bed, the square overhead lamp suddenly resembling a diamond from my skewed perspective. A gargled wailing filled my ears, bleeding into the walls, as if the room itself had begun to scream.

“Stop crying!” he bellowed through my sleepy haze.

Panic crashed through me, hollowing my chest like the wind had been knocked clean out of it.

“What the *fuck* do you think you’re doing?” I demanded, bolting upright, “Have you *completely* lost your mind?”

A sheen of sweat clung to his upper lip, and thin, spidery capillaries threaded the whites of his eyes. Terror danced behind his staggered expression, loud and clumsy. He let go of my shoulders, his hands falling to his knees with a sharp exasperated slap.

“Where were you taking me?” my voice quivered, as though I wasn’t sure I wanted to know the answer.

His breath caught, nostrils flaring as though he were about to cry, “Just…out of the tandoori…”

I followed his gaze to the foot of the bed, where one of the takeaway boxes had somehow latched itself onto my foot, my left trouser leg now looking like it had taken a dive in tandoori sauce. Matt’s gaze lingered on me, almost like he was daring me to believe him.

“I don’t know what’s gotten into you today,” I said, once the silence got too loud, “But I am done. I’ve had enough. I am going to clean this mess up and then-” I glanced at my watch. Half six. “-then I’ll get dinner going.”

He slouched on the bed, silent, as if all the fight had been drained out of him.

“God, it smells awful in here,” I winced at the pungent mixture of tandoori sauce, sweat, and… something else. I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, “Let me just toss my pants in the wash.”

Momentarily, his eyes lit up as if I’d presented him with a long-coveted gift. As I made my way down the hallway of our apartment, I questioned whether I had only imagined it. Yes, *obviously* I’d imagined it. It was probably just the lighting. A trick of the eyes. I slid out of my tandoori-stained grey slacks and shoved them into the washing machine. I’d deal with them later. 

A dull thud came from the bedroom. *Good*, I thought. At least he was up. 

“Hey, how’d you fancy some lasagne for dinner?” I called, injecting a forced cheerfulness into my tone, “I think there’s still some in the f-”

As I turned into the bedroom, the sentence died in my throat. He stood motionless at the foot of the bed, pale, rigid, his face a picture of blank intensity. He wasn’t blinking and he didn’t seem to be breathing either. 

A cold weight settled in my chest, “What’s wrong?”

No answer. Only the muted patter of the first drops of rain on the window.

I swallowed, “*Matt?*”

I didn’t like the way he was looking at me - like he wasn’t seeing me at all, just staring through me. The room reeked, the smell wrapping around me like a wet cloth, as I doubled over against the door frame, heaving.

“Can you get that *damn* tandoori out of here?” I pleaded, “Let’s open the window.”

But Matthew didn’t move. Not a single breath, nor a curl of the toes. I could tell from his vacant expression that whatever I’d just said hadn’t even registered.

“Matthew,” I said, trying to keep my voice level, “Please, work with me here. You’re scaring me and I don’t know what to make of this.”

He swallowed, and then again, and a third time. 

“It was…” he whispered, “It’s only a nightmare…”

A *nightmare*. I held back an eye roll, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was deeply, irreversibly wrong. Well, what was I *meant* to do? Call for an ambulance? Continue to stand there and watch him unravel? 

Another thought gnawed at my mind - just how safe was *I,* really? He didn’t appear aggressive, but his demeanor flipped with no warning, and I’d certainly had my fill of surprises for one day.

“Honey,” I started, pattering across the carpet in my bare feet, making sure not to make any sudden movements, “Let me make you a cup of tea, okay?”

Silence.

I cleared my throat, “...And then I will drive up to the mall, maybe meet up with a friend, so you can get some rest, how does that sound?”

Feeling him flinch underneath his drenched shirt, I breathed a sigh of relief. Okay. *Strategic.* 

I kept my hand steady on his elbow as we made our way to the kitchen. His statue-like manner had given way to a jitteriness that coursed through every inch of his body.

“Sit down right here,” I instructed, as though he were a toddler, “What kind of tea would you like?”

“Peppermint…” he managed after a pause, “W-with two sugars…”

Obediently, I plopped a tea bag into his mug, “Hey, I need to get some new pants from the bedroom before I leave for the mall. Would you m-”

“No,” his tone was abrupt and no-nonsense, “I’ll go with you.”

Disbelief washed over me. One thing was crystal clear - he didn’t want me going anywhere near that bedroom.

“Okay,” I said, gulping down my apprehension, “Then we’ll go once you’ve finished your tea.”

That seemed to put him at ease, but I could feel his eyes burning a hole into my back as I brewed his drink.

“Right,” I said, in my most matter-of-fact voice, “Nature calls. I’ll be right back.”

His fingers clamped down on my wrist as I tried to brush past him.

“No,” he hissed, “Sit.”

So, I sat. My heart was hammering behind my eyes with the threat of tears, but I held my own. My husband sat across from me, nursing his peppermint tea, his gaze never wavering. At this point, I knew without a shadow of a doubt there was something more than a mere *‘nightmare’* at play. I could tell he was counting on me to head to the mall once he finished and would insist on chauffeuring me around the apartment until then. Was I in danger? No. I couldn’t be. *Could I?*

His bloodshot eyes gleamed as if he’d read my thoughts. *Fuck this.* I swallowed, praying the audible gulp wouldn’t give away my distress. A reflex of self-preservation, I crossed my ankles and felt the scab on the bridge of my foot split open, releasing a warm trickle that slid between my toes. 

I buried the yelp before it surfaced, recalling last week’s blister—larger, meaner—still clinging for dear life to my pinky toe. Now, if I could just… 

I scraped at it with the remnants of last month’s pedicure, willing it to burst.

“Are you alright?” Matthew was observing me through narrowed eyes, “Do you need to pee *that* bad?”

I shook my head, “No.”

“Then what is it?”

As the scab surrendered, I leaned down in my seat, feigning an absentminded scratch at my ankle.

“I just…” I sniffed, “Aunt Irma’s in.”

His incredulous gaze narrowed, “What?”

I lifted my blood-stained palm and gestured downwards with my chin, “I’m on my period.”

Aghast, he watched as I stood up from the table, revealing fresh streaks of red across my calves and thighs. I held my breath, willing him not to notice how much more coated my feet were than my legs.

“*Jesus*,” he whispered, nostrils flaring in obvious disgust, “God, you didn’t think to mention *this?*”

I bit my lip, “I said I needed to use the b-”

“*God,* please just get it cleaned up. *Now.*”

I jumped at the opportunity before he could change his mind, wincing with every step as the open wounds on my feet throbbed their painful reminder. Heading straight for the bedroom, I attempted to piece together a mental to-do list for when I got there. What exactly was I hoping to do? Was I looking for something? If so, *what?* A bong? A bottle of pills? A *fleshlight?*

Bursting into the bedroom and slamming the door shut behind me, I let out an involuntary retch as the overpowering stench hit me full force. It was even worse than a half-hour ago. The odour of tandoori and sweat had vanished, replaced by something far more pungent - a heavy, putrid stench, resembling rotting sewage baked into the floorboards.

“Isla?!” Matt’s distant voice emanated through the keyhole, urging me to twist the key and toss it across the room, “Is everything okay?”

Any second now, he’d figure out I’m not in the bathroom and come looking. I had to move. 

“Uh, yeah!” I bellowed, “Just getting washed up!”

Okay, *closet.* I yanked it open, heart in my throat. Clothes, underwear, belts and purses, yada-yada-yada. No, *wait.* That was no way to look. Haphazardly, I began sweeping the clothes off of the shelves, letting them fall to the floor in a heap. *Nothing.* And the smell wasn’t even coming from the closet, it was more centered, more…

I crouched in front of the TV set, retrieving stacks of obsolete DVDs and tossing them carelessly into the growing pile of clutter in front of the closet. The bedroom looked as though it had been ripped through by a hurricane. *God*, what was I even looking for?

The door handle jerked downward with a sudden jolt, making me flinch, and then snapped down again, as if refusing to believe it was locked.

“*Isla?* What are you doing? Open the door.”

A flicker of panic trilled in his voice.

My breath caught in my throat, “I- I am just getting changed. For the mall.”

Not bothering to get up, I crawled over to his nightstand, nearly ripping the dry-fit drawer out with the seams. Condoms. Lube. Loose Malteasers with tiny hairs. *Nothing.* 

“Open this door. *Right now.*”

My husband’s voice suddenly seemed to tower above the room. My stomach in knots, I checked my own nightstand. Hand cream. Birth control. Loose Malteasers with tiny hairs. *God.*

“I’m coming!”

The smell was making my eyes water. I punched the curtains, yanking them from their holders. A flurry of dust bunnies erupted into the air, circling their way to the floor. Overcome with a sense of helplessness, I watched them descend towards my bloody feet.

“Enough!” Matthew’s voice thundered. His body slammed into the door panel with a deafening blow.

“Wait! Stop!” I cried, “You’ll break the door!”

But Matthew seemed intent to do exactly that. With trembling hands, I scanned the room for anything that might help, or make sense of what was happening. Heavy blows slammed against the wood, forcing the hinges to squeal in protest. 

“It’s *your* fault!” he roared, “*You* did this!”

A trail of cold sweat bloomed down my spine. He’d lost it. I couldn’t risk it anymore. I had to get out. *Now.* 

I spun to face the window. Thank God, we lived on the first floor. I could probably get away with minimal damage - a sprain, maybe a fracture, at most. As I cracked it open, one of the white socks still sitting on the windowsill tumbled to the floor. Instinctively, I bent down to pick it up, but then caught sight of something I hadn’t noticed before.

The bottom right corner of the fitted sheet had come loose, draping limply across the mattress. I stared at it, suddenly oblivious to my husband’s visceral yelling. This had never been an issue in the past, no matter how raunchy we got. In fact, the only way to really undo the elasticated corners was to…

The centre panel of the door came flying across the room, landing on top of a stack of DVDs. Through it, my husband glared at me like a rabid dog waiting to pounce. No axe for me, *thankfully*. Though it was a small mercy he wasn’t shouting *‘Here’s Johnny!’*.

“Isla, open the door, please. I’ll explain everything.”

I heaved a sigh of relief as I realized the door key was buried under mounds of clothing, never to be seen again. 

“I’m listening.”

But I wasn’t *really* listening. My attention was fixed on the stubbornly erect corner of the fitted sheet.

“Look, I don’t know what you know, exactly,” his voice wavered, “But it was an accident. You just wouldn’t leave and then you fell asleep and… and…”

I gawked at him in silence, tracing the leather flap for the bed storage with clammy fingers. He must have noticed my apprehension.

“Get away from the bed, okay? Come here. Open the door. Nothing’s happened.”

With one fell swoop, I yanked the leather flap on my side of the bed upwards, revealing the storage space beneath. The smell hit me ten-fold as the compartment yawned open.

Inside, clad in nothing but a pair of knee-high stockings, lay a young woman. She couldn’t have been older than twenty-five, her wavy auburn hair fanned out like spilled blood across the linen sets. Her eyes were wide open - milky and glazed over, trails of mascara creeping across her cheeks, all the way down to her earlobes. One of her hands contorted unnaturally behind her, the other was frozen mid-clutch around a cellphone, as if she’d tried to call for help she never received. A small black ‘M’ was inked inside a heart on her translucent collarbone.

I staggered backwards abruptly, my breath hitching in my chest.

The foot of the storage compartment was flooded with fresh urine and liquid faeces, seeping through the linen, its sharp ammonia sting making my head reel. I’d seen enough True Crime documentaries to expect death’s last crude signature, but never like this. I heaved as my husband watched through the broken door pane. 

He didn’t need to explain. The truth hung thick in the air between us, permeating every room of the home we’d built, staining our sheets with shit and piss, scratching over our vows in cursive, tattoo-parlor script. 

A slow, slithering dread whispered that this was on me. I’d come home too early. I’d said no to the mall. I’d insisted on that damn nap. Every choice I’d made had led here. This, whatever *this* was, was on me.

“I told you it was just a nightmare,” he murmured through the door, an edge to his voice, “Now it’s yours to live.”
