It’s been a few days since I saw my… dad, and only now have I managed to summon the strength to share what happened. I don’t have much to say yet—my thoughts are still a tangled mess—but I’ll start with that day. Some of you were right in ways I wish you hadn’t been.



As I drove to my parents’ house, a memory from my teenage years surfaced, unbidden and vivid. I was fifteen then, coming home from what had been, up until that point, the worst day of my life.



I had a boyfriend—my first—named Carlos. For as long as I could remember, I’d had the biggest crush on him. When he finally asked me out, I was over the moon. In my head, I’d already written a whole future for us—wedding bells, a little house, children running in the yard.



I was hopelessly naïve.



Carlos knew I adored him, and he used that knowledge to his advantage. At first, he was sweet and charming, the perfect boyfriend. But as the months went by, he started testing my boundaries. He was patient, persistent. Bit by bit, I gave in. By the time he got what he wanted, I was too blind in my devotion to see the truth about him.



The very next day, he broke up with me. Worse, he told all his friends what had happened. I could feel their judgment in their stares, the way they whispered when I walked by. In a single day, I went from being just another girl to being *that* girl.



When I got home, I went straight to my room and shut the door, locking it tight behind me. My parents must’ve sensed something was wrong. They knocked and called out to me, but I ignored them, turning my music up as loud as it would go. I knew I’d catch hell for that later, but I didn’t care.



I just wanted to cry in peace, to bury myself in my bed and never come out.



When the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the house in a soft, dusky light, I finally emerged from my room to head to the bathroom. My dad was standing right there, just outside my door, waiting silently. His arms were crossed, but his expression betrayed him—his eyes were filled with quiet worry.



“I made you something to eat,” he said gently. “Do you want to have it in the dining room or… your room?”



I didn’t trust myself to face him at the table, so I chose my room.



By the time I returned, the food was already on my desk—a simple sandwich, neatly placed on a plate. Beside it was a small note, written in his unmistakable handwriting. Three words stared back at me: *I love you.*



I cried when I read it. The guilt of making him worry hit me like a wave, overwhelming and relentless. He didn’t yell. He didn’t demand answers. He just stood there, offering quiet support in the only way he knew how.



After eating the sandwich, I sat on my bed and tried to collect myself. My tears dried, though the ache in my chest remained. I knew I couldn’t avoid the truth any longer. Whatever happened next—his anger, his disappointment—I would face it. He deserved honesty, no matter the cost.



I called him into my room, my voice barely louder than a whisper. He appeared almost immediately, his footsteps soft, as if he didn’t want to startle me. Sitting down beside me, he asked, “What’s wrong?”



I took a deep breath, my hands trembling as I clutched them together. My throat felt tight, my voice unsteady, but I forced the words out. My eyes burned from all the crying I’d already done, but I looked at him and told him everything. Every last detail.



When I finished, he looked at me, his silence heavier than any words could have been. I braced myself for the anger, for the disappointment I was so sure would follow. But instead, what I saw in his eyes was something far more complicated—anger, yes, but not at me. It was a molten, searing fury that could have melted steel, directed at someone who wasn’t in the room. Beneath that, there was sadness, deep and endless, like an ocean you could drown in. And then there was something else, something I couldn’t quite name.



But it wasn’t disappointment.



He stood up slowly, his movements deliberate, and before I could say anything, he wrapped his arms around me. The hug was silent but full of infinite love, so steady and strong that I couldn’t hold back my tears. I cried into his chest, and he held me tighter, as if to shield me from every hurt in the world.



“Everything’s going to be okay,” he murmured softly, his voice steady and warm. “You’ll always be my special girl, Clara. Nothing will ever change that. Nothing.”



That night, for the first time in what felt like forever, I felt safe. As the weight of everything began to settle, I asked him, in a voice barely above a whisper, if he could stay with me until I fell asleep. I didn’t want to be alone, not yet.



He didn’t hesitate. “Of course,” he said, pulling the chair from my desk closer to my bed.



I remember waking up the next morning to find him still there, sitting slumped in the chair, fast asleep. His hand was resting on the edge of my bed, as if even in sleep, he refused to let me go.



I sat in my car, gripping the steering wheel, the memory of my father asleep beside my bed replaying in my head like an old, comforting film. It felt ironic—bitterly so—that now, after everything, I didn’t want to get out and walk into my parents’ house to see him. Before the tapes, I would’ve been ecstatic. I used to miss him so much whenever he went on his trips. But now? Now, the thought of seeing him filled me with a dread so heavy it almost made me turn the key and drive away.



But that wasn’t an option.



With a deep breath, I stepped out of the car, the cold air biting at my skin, and used my key to open the front door. As it clicked open, I called out, “Hello!” loud enough to be heard from wherever they might be.



My dad appeared almost instantly, emerging from the kitchen with his familiar gait. His face lit up when he saw me, and he closed the distance quickly, pulling me into a tight hug. His arms wrapped around me with all the affection I remembered, but I couldn’t bring myself to hug him back.



“Three months is too long,” he said, kissing my cheek like he always did.



I forced a smile, though it felt wrong, lopsided. “Yeah, especially at your age, Dad. You should just retire and stay with Mom. She gets really lonely.” My eyes flicked over his shoulder, searching for her, but the house was still. She didn’t come out to greet me.



“Speaking of which, where is Mom?”



The lightness in his face dimmed as though a switch had been flipped. It was subtle but unmistakable—the joy drained away, replaced by something heavier, something that made my stomach twist.



“I told her to keep herself busy today,” he said, his voice quieter now. “You and I need to talk. Alone.”



My heart sank. The weight of his words pressed on me, and I suddenly felt cold, even in the warmth of the house.



“Okay,” I said hesitantly, trying to keep my voice steady. “How should we do this?"



He led me to the living room—the same living room where I had first watched the video of the woman in the woods. Sitting there now, the air felt heavier, suffocating. We didn’t speak for a few seconds, but those seconds stretched out endlessly. I could feel the tension building, sharp and unbearable, like the static charge before a storm.



I watched his face shift, slowly, imperceptibly at first. The warm familiarity of my father’s expression faded, replaced by something colder, sterner—a figure of authority rather than a parent. He was trying, I could tell, to find the right way to begin, to pick the right words. But the weight of whatever he wanted to say hung in the air, suffocating both of us.



Finally, he spoke. His voice was cold, distant, stripped of any warmth. “Did you do as I told you?”



The tone hit me like a slap. It sent me back to my childhood, to moments when his words were enough to make me shrink into myself, to feel like a little girl again. My nerves fluttered, but I steadied myself.



“No,” I replied, my voice calm despite the tightness in my chest. “I didn’t watch the rest of the videos, but I know what’s on them. Military men torturing people.”



His face didn’t betray a single emotion, but I felt the weight of my words in the way his shoulders stiffened ever so slightly. The silence that followed was thick, heavier than before, filled with things neither of us dared to say.



"I see."



That was all he said.



The words hung in the air, thin and fragile, as if they could break under the weight of what wasn’t being said. I waited a couple of seconds, my heart pounding against my ribs, before speaking again.



"Why did you guys have this?" My voice wavered, anger and confusion tangled in every syllable. "It’s horrific. What are tapes of torture and a..." I paused, swallowing hard. The next word felt too heavy, too sharp to let out. "Murder... doing alongside videos of my childhood and family trips?"



He sighed deeply, the kind of sigh that seemed to pull years from his body. For a moment, I saw him differently—not as my father, but as a man carrying the weight of something too dark, too large for one person to bear. He looked older than I’d ever seen him.



"I thought I got rid of those tapes," he admitted, his voice low, almost resigned. "I’d never imagined your mother made copies of them."



I thought I was ready for anything he might say, for any dark truth he could reveal. But hearing him admit it outright—that he knew what the tapes contained, that he’d tried to erase them—shattered me. My world splintered in that moment, the pieces too jagged and sharp to ever fit back together.



He knew.



He knew, and he’d tried to bury the truth.



Whatever came next would only drive the knife deeper into my chest. And I wasn’t sure I could survive it.



The silence between us felt alive, heavy and breathing, pressing down on my chest like an iron weight. My father—no, the man I had called my father—sat across from me, his hands resting on his knees. His posture was rigid, his jaw clenched tightly as if he could will himself into stone. But his eyes betrayed him. They were fixed on the floor, darting occasionally as though searching for some invisible escape.



I broke the silence first. My voice, thin and sharp, wavered under the weight of the question I was terrified to ask. "What did you do?"



He sighed, the sound long and heavy, as though he'd been holding it in for decades. Slowly, he ran a hand over his face, and when he finally looked up, his eyes held something I hadn’t expected: not guilt, not shame—defiance.



“I followed orders,” he said, his tone cold and measured, like a soldier reciting a report.



“Orders?” The word twisted in my throat. “Orders to kidnap my parents? To erase them from existence?” My voice cracked, trembling with anger I could barely contain.



He flinched, but his expression hardened quickly, as though the weakness embarrassed him. “Your father,” he began, his voice clipped, “was a university professor. He taught literature. But he wasn’t innocent. He hid three students—students who were wanted by the state. That made him a threat.”



I froze, his words striking me like a slap. “He taught *literature*,” I said, incredulous. “That’s what made him dangerous? Reading books?”



His lips pressed into a thin line. “He harbored fugitives, Clara. They were guerrillas, planning attacks. He knew exactly what he was doing.”



“And you?” I demanded, leaning forward, my voice rising. “Did you know what you were doing? When you dragged them out of their home, when you watched them disappear, did you know what you were doing?”



His silence stretched, damning in its refusal to break.



“They were enemies of the state,” he said finally, his voice brittle. “It wasn’t my decision. I was just following protocol.”



“Protocol,” I spat, the word bitter on my tongue. “You’re hiding behind that like it absolves you. You had a choice, and you chose *this*.”



“What was I supposed to do?” His voice cracked, but not from regret. It was defensive, angry. “Refuse orders? End up like them? Do you think I had the luxury of moral outrage?”



“Yes!” I shouted, the force of it surprising even me. “Yes, you were supposed to refuse. You were supposed to *be human*.”



For a moment, his mask slipped. His shoulders sagged, his eyes darting away from mine. But then he straightened again, his composure snapping back into place. “I did what I could,” he said quietly, the words almost lost in the oppressive silence. “I made sure you were safe.”



“Safe.” The word burned like acid in my throat.



“You knew,” I said, my voice trembling. “You knew who I was. From the beginning, didn’t you?”



His gaze faltered, but he didn’t deny it. “Yes,” he admitted, the word landing like a death knell.



“How?” I asked, though every part of me screamed not to. I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.



He hesitated, his hands clenching into fists on his knees. “Your mother,” he said finally, his voice low and detached, “was pregnant when we arrested her.”



The world seemed to tilt. My breath caught, my vision swimming. Pregnant. My mother. The woman who existed only as shadow in old tapes, a sob in the dark. The woman I had never known but who had been everything to me without my even realizing it.



“That’s how I knew who you were,” he continued, his tone clinical. “When they gave you to us, I recognized you immediately. You... you looked like her.”



A cold, hollow pit opened in my chest. “And what happened to her?” The words felt foreign, like they were being spoken by someone else.



“She didn’t make it,” he said, his voice flat. “Neither of them did. They were classified as subversives. It wasn’t—”



“Don’t,” I cut him off, my voice sharp and cracking. “Don’t you dare tell me it wasn’t your decision. You were there. You watched them die. And then you brought me into this house and pretended you were some kind of savior.”



“I gave you a life,” he said, his voice rising with an edge of desperation. “A chance. Do you think they could have given you that? They were criminals, Clara. They would have—”



“Stop!” I screamed, the word reverberating off the walls. “Just stop. You don’t get to rewrite history. You don’t get to steal me and call it salvation.”



He recoiled as though I had struck him, his face pale and hollow. For a moment, I thought he might cry, but I didn’t care. I couldn’t care.



“You raised me,” I said, my voice trembling with anger and something else I couldn’t name. “You fed me, clothed me, tucked me into bed at night—all while knowing you had taken everything from me. How do you live with yourself?”



“I thought I was doing the right thing,” he whispered, his voice barely audible.



“The right thing?” I repeated, laughing bitterly. “For who? For me? For you? You think this is what they would have wanted for me? To be raised by the man who destroyed them?”



“I wanted to protect you,” he said, but his voice lacked conviction now. He looked smaller, the weight of his sins finally crushing him. “I wanted to give you the life they never could.”



I pushed back my chair abruptly, the screech of wood against tile cutting through the air like a knife. “You didn’t give me a life,” I said, my voice low and trembling with fury. “You took it. You stole me, and you stole them from me.”



He didn’t stop me as I walked away. I didn’t look back. Outside, the cold air hit my face like a slap, sharp and biting. It felt real, more real than the man inside that house, more real than the lies he had woven around me for years.



I leaned against the car, my body shaking, tears streaming down my face. The truth was an unbearable weight, pressing down on my chest until I couldn’t breathe. I stared up at the sky, letting the cold numb me.



I thought of my mother, pregnant and terrified, her life taken before she ever got the chance to hold me. I thought of my father, a man who had risked everything to protect his students, only to lose it all.



And then I thought of him—my so-called father—sitting in that room, his hands clean in his own mind, even as the blood dripped from them.



I didn’t just lose my parents. He erased them.



That night, I didn’t go home. Instead, I drove aimlessly through the city for hours, letting the hum of the radio and the glow of passing streetlights distract me from the chaos in my mind. The streets were my refuge, the motion keeping the thoughts at bay. But every time a red light forced me to stop, reality would creep back in, sharp and relentless. My fingers tightened around the steering wheel until my nails dug into the leather, the pain grounding me just enough to hold back the tears threatening to spill over.



Eventually, hunger caught up with me, and I pulled into a gas station. I sat under the harsh fluorescent lights, eating a burger that tasted like cardboard, more out of necessity than desire. My thoughts churned in the background, a relentless storm, but then one idea surfaced—a dark, terrifying thought. It made my stomach twist, but the more I stared at it, the more it solidified. I told myself it was the only thing left to do, the last piece of this unbearable puzzle.



With trembling fingers, I sent a text to Lucas, telling him I’d be staying with my sister. The lie felt hollow even as I typed it, but it was easier than explaining. Then, without hesitation, I turned off my phone and let the screen go dark, as if that could silence the world for a little while.



The first hotel I saw became my sanctuary. I walked into the lobby and forced a smile at the receptionist, every muscle in my face straining against the weight of my emotions. Checking in felt like a surreal performance, a play I had no interest in acting out. But somehow, I made it through, the fake smile still plastered on my face as I took the key and climbed the stairs to a room that promised no comfort, but at least, some solitude.



The room was silent, save for the faint hum of the laptop. I sat on the edge of the bed, the cheap polyester blanket tangled around my legs. The key to the pendrive felt heavier than it should in my hand, as though it carried all the weight of the truth I was about to uncover.



I stared at the laptop screen, my thumb hesitating over the touchpad. A part of me wanted to leave it closed, to walk away and let this nightmare end. But the curiosity—the need—was too strong. If I didn’t watch, I would never move on.



And I needed to know.



The first video loaded slowly, the spinning icon on the screen matching the pounding rhythm of my heart. When it began, the image was shaky, the camera focusing on nothing but the dirt floor of a dimly lit room.



Then the voices started.



At first, they were muffled, low and unintelligible. Then the camera shifted, and I saw them—two men, their heads hooded, their hands bound behind their backs, kneeling on the ground. A third man paced in front of them, his boots crunching against the dirt. His voice was calm, methodical, but the words he spoke were laced with venom.



"Names," he said. "Give me the names."



The camera moved again, making the face of the interrogator barely recognizable. My stomach dropped. It was him. My so-called father, younger but unmistakable. His expression was cold, detached, the face of someone who had done this a hundred times and would do it a hundred more.



My hands clenched the edges of the laptop as the scene unfolded.



One of the hooded men groaned, his voice hoarse. "I don’t know anything," he said, barely audible.



The sound that followed made my blood run cold—a sharp, wet crack as the interrogator’s fist connected with the man’s jaw. The groan turned into a muffled cry, the man doubling over as blood dripped onto the ground beneath him.



“Stop lying,” he said, his voice sharp and cutting. “You’re only making this harder on yourself.”



The camera panned to the second figure, who trembled but said nothing. Something about his posture—the way his shoulders were hunched, the protective angle of his body—made my breath catch.



It was him. My father. My real father.



A wave of nausea washed over me, my vision swimming. I wanted to close the laptop, to turn away, but I couldn’t. I was frozen, trapped by the image on the screen.



My fake father stepped toward him, his shadow falling over the man. "And you," he said. "You’re the one who hid them, aren’t you? You thought you could outsmart us.”



The man lifted his head slightly, and though the hood obscured his face, I could feel his defiance. He didn’t speak, but his silence was answer enough.



“Fine,” said his tormentor, the tone of his voice chillingly calm. “If you won’t talk, we’ll try another method.”



The camera shifted again, and suddenly my mother was there.



She was seated in a chair, her hands tied behind her back, her face pale but resolute. Her stomach, rounded and unmistakable, told me everything I needed to know.



I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. She was pregnant. She was pregnant with me.



The man who raised me crouched in front of her, his expression softening in a way that made me sick. “We don’t have to do this,” he said, his voice almost gentle. “Just tell us what we need to know, and you can go home. You and your child.”



She stared at him, her face a mixture of terror and fury. “You’ll kill us anyway,” she said, her voice trembling but steady.



He didn’t respond, just straightened and nodded to someone offscreen.



The screen blurred as the camera moved again, and the next sound was one I would never forget. A scream. My mother’s scream.



I slammed the laptop shut, my chest heaving as I gasped for air. My hands shook violently, my vision blurred by tears. The room felt too small, the walls closing in around me.



I stumbled to the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before the bile rose in my throat. I retched until there was nothing left, my body trembling with the force of it.



When I finally straightened, gripping the edges of the sink for support, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My face was pale, my eyes wide and bloodshot. I didn’t recognize the person staring back at me.



I sank to the floor, my knees pressed against the cold tile. The truth was too much, too overwhelming.



He knew. He had known all along. And he had done this.



The screams from the video echoed in my mind, a haunting refrain that would never leave me.



They weren’t just my parents.



They were his victims.



Several days have passed since I began writing this, but the memory of that video still haunts me. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to forget it. My mother’s scream, raw and piercing, echoes in my mind—the only fragment of her voice I will ever hear. It lingers, filling the silence, a reminder of everything I’ve lost without ever truly knowing.



I don’t know what to do. When I first watched those old tapes, it was supposed to be a moment of nostalgia, a peek into the past. I never imagined it would tear my world apart. In hindsight, my life had been blissfully normal—perfect, even. But in just a few days, that illusion shattered. I uncovered the truth about my parents, and in the process, lost what I thought was my family. But was it ever truly a family, if it was built on lies?



The most heartbreaking part is that I have no idea how to honor my real parents. They are little more than ghosts to me, shadows in the dark. All I have is a single photograph of my mother and those terrible, grainy videos. I don’t know their names. I don’t know anything about them. And the people who might have known, the ones who could help me piece together their story, are all gone.



I’ve spent hours scouring the internet, poring over lists and archives of the desaparecidos. There are so many names, so many faces, but none I can pin to the memories I wish I had. It’s overwhelming—like trying to find a single star in a galaxy. Professor García suggested reaching out to organizations that specialize in these cases, people who could help me trace my parents’ identities. But the thought terrifies me. What if I learn more than I can handle? What if the truth is worse than what I already know?



This all happened so long ago, yet its shadow stretches into my life, into the present. Most of those responsible have served their sentences or are already dead, their crimes buried with them. But not that man. He still walks free. He lived his life to the fullest, built a family, raised me. And somehow, he used me—my very existence—as a shield against the atrocities he committed. That thought makes my stomach turn, fills me with a cold, paralyzing dread.



There are nights when I wonder if I’ll ever feel whole again. If I’ll ever know who I truly am. My real parents are strangers to me, yet they’re the foundation of everything I’ve been searching for. How do I mourn people I never knew? How do I carry the weight of their legacy, their suffering, when all I have are fragments—just questions and echoes?



I’m sorry, Mom.



I’m sorry, Dad.



I hope one day I’ll be brave enough to find you. I hope I’ll learn your names, your faces, your stories. And I hope that, wherever you are, you’ll know that I am trying. Trying to remember you. Trying to honor you. Trying to be the person you might have wanted me to be.
