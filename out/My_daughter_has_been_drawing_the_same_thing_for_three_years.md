My daughter Iris is eight years old, and she draws every single day. Not unusual for a kid, right? Most children go through phases. Dinosaurs, princesses, horses with impossible proportions. Iris went through those phases too, before.

Three years ago, when she was five, she started drawing something new. At first, I thought it was cute. She’d sit at the kitchen table with her crayons and sketch these simple figures. A big one and a small one, holding hands. The big one always wore a red dress. The small one was always smiling.

“That’s beautiful, sweetie,” I’d say. “Is that you and Mommy?”

She’d shake her head. “That’s the lady and the girl.”

“What lady?”

“The one who comes to my room.”

I laughed it off. Imaginary friends are normal. Healthy, even. My wife Emma and I joked about it that night after Iris went to bed. We clinked our wine glasses together and I said something stupid like, “At least she’s creative.”

But Iris kept drawing them. Every single day. The same two figures, holding hands. Sometimes they stood in front of a house. Sometimes in a field. Sometimes in darkness with tiny white dots she said were stars. But always the same: the woman in the red dress and the small smiling child.

After a few months, I started to notice details. The woman’s dress had buttons now. Seven of them. The child’s smile had gotten wider, showing teeth. Iris’s artistic skills were improving, but the subject never changed.

“Honey, why don’t you draw something else?” Emma suggested one afternoon. “How about a puppy? You love puppies.”

“I can’t,” Iris said, not looking up from her paper. “She wants me to draw her.”

“The lady wants you to?”

“She says I need to remember. So she visits me and I draw.”

Emma and I exchanged a glance. That night we talked about it more seriously. Maybe Iris was having trouble adjusting to her new school. Maybe she was stressed. We decided to give it more time.

The drawings continued. Month after month. Iris turned six, and she still drew the woman and the child every day. The images became more detailed, more refined. The woman’s face developed features. Curly dark hair. A thin nose. Sad eyes that Iris somehow captured with just a crayon.

I should mention something I haven’t said yet. Emma and I had another daughter before Iris. Her name was Lily. She died when she was four, two years before Iris was born. It was sudden. An aneurysm. One moment she was laughing at breakfast, the next she was gone. We don’t talk about her much. It’s too hard. Her room is still exactly as she left it, at the end of the hall. We keep the door closed.

When Iris was seven, I noticed something in one of her drawings that made my stomach drop. The child in the picture was wearing a specific shirt. Yellow with a cartoon bee on it. I recognized it immediately because I’d bought it for Lily. It was her favorite shirt. She was wearing it the morning she died.

I never mentioned that shirt to Iris. We’d put all of Lily’s clothes in boxes in the attic before Iris was born. There was no way she could have known about it.

“Where did you see that shirt?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

“The girl wears it,” Iris said simply. “She likes bees.”

My hands started shaking. “What’s the girl’s name?”

Iris looked up at me with her big brown eyes. “She doesn’t tell me. The lady calls her ‘my little flower.’”

That was Emma’s nickname for Lily. My little flower.

I went to Emma’s office and closed the door. I asked her if she’d shown Iris any pictures of Lily, if she’d mentioned the bee shirt, if she’d called Iris “my little flower” maybe without thinking. Emma started crying. She hadn’t. We’d agreed not to burden Iris with the weight of the sister she’d never known. Not yet. Maybe when she was older.

That night after Iris fell asleep, Emma and I went through the boxes in the attic. We found the bee shirt. We also found photos we hadn’t looked at in years. In one of them, I was wearing a red dress. It was from a company Christmas party, about six months before Lily died. Emma had convinced me to dress up as Mrs. Claus as a joke. I’m smiling in the photo. Lily is on my hip, laughing.

I was the woman in the red dress.

The next morning I asked Iris to describe the lady. She put down her orange crayon and thought about it.

“She’s pretty,” Iris said. “She has a nice voice. She’s sad sometimes.”

“What does she tell you?”

“She says she misses someone. She says she comes to visit because she doesn’t want to forget her little flower. She says if she forgets, it’s like she never existed at all.”

I couldn’t breathe. Emma, standing in the doorway, let out a sound I’d never heard her make before.

“She says she’s scared,” Iris continued, coloring in the red dress. “She says one day she won’t remember what the laughing sounds like anymore. Or what the little hands felt like. Or the way she smelled like strawberry shampoo.”

Lily’s shampoo. The one we’d bought because she insisted on it, even though it cost twice as much.

“Iris,” I whispered. “When does she visit you?”

“At night, mostly. Sometimes I wake up and she’s sitting on my bed, holding the girl’s hand. She looks at me and cries. Then they walk down the hall together.”

“Down the hall? Where do they go?”

“To the room with the closed door.”

Lily’s room.

I don’t know how long Emma and I stood there. Time felt strange. Iris kept drawing, her hand moving in practiced motions. The woman and the child. Always together. Never separate.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Around 2 AM, I got up and walked down the hall. I stood outside Lily’s closed door, my hand on the doorknob. From inside, I heard something. Soft singing. A lullaby I used to sing when Lily couldn’t sleep.

I opened the door.

The room was exactly as we’d left it. The small bed with its purple comforter. The stuffed animals lined up on the shelf. The nightlight that cast stars on the ceiling. And sitting on the bed, barely visible in the dim light, I saw something. Not a person exactly. More like the memory of a person. The shape of someone who used to exist, refusing to disappear completely.

She looked up at me with my own face. But it was wrong somehow. Older. More tired. Eaten away by something I couldn’t name. Beside her sat the shadow of a little girl in a bee shirt.

“I don’t want to forget her,” the shadow said in my voice. “I can’t forget her.”

“I haven’t,” I said. “We haven’t forgotten her.”

“Yes, you have. You closed this door. You packed her away. You had another daughter and pretended this one never existed. You smile now. You laugh. You’ve moved on.”

“That’s not fair. We grieve every single day.”

“Do you?” The shadow stood up. The child’s hand in hers. “When was the last time you said her name out loud? When was the last time you told Iris about her sister? When was the last time you let yourself remember what she smelled like?”

I realized I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t remember the last time. It had been months. Maybe a year. We’d gotten so good at not talking about it, at protecting ourselves from the pain, that we’d let her slip away in the silence.

“Iris sees us because she doesn’t know not to,” the shadow continued. “She doesn’t know that dead daughters are supposed to stay buried. So we visit her and she draws us. She helps us remember.”

“What are you?” I asked.

The shadow smiled sadly. “I’m every version of you that can’t let go. Every moment you’ve suppressed, every memory you’ve locked away, every word you swallowed instead of saying her name. I’m what happens when love has nowhere to go.”

The shadow and the child walked toward me. As they got closer, I could see more details. The child’s smile. The woman’s tears. They looked so tired. So desperately tired.

“Help me,” the shadow whispered. “I can’t carry her alone anymore.”

Then they walked through me, and I felt it. Three years of grief I’d pushed down. Three years of memories I’d avoided. The sound of Lily’s laugh. The weight of her in my arms. The way she said “Mama” when she was scared. The strawberry smell of her hair. The breakfast table. The sudden seizure. The ambulance. The hospital. The doctor’s face. The funeral. The empty room. The closed door. The silence. The terrible, endless silence.

I collapsed in the hallway. Emma found me there, sobbing. I told her everything.

The next morning, we sat down with Iris. We showed her pictures of Lily. We told her about her sister. We said her name out loud, over and over, until it stopped feeling like a curse. We opened Lily’s door. We sat in her room together as a family. We cried. We laughed about funny things Lily used to do. We remembered.

Iris listened carefully. Then she said, “The lady will be happy you’re helping now.”

That night, I did something I hadn’t done in three years. I went into Lily’s room before bed. I sat on her little bed. I held her favorite stuffed rabbit. And I talked to her. I told her about my day. About Iris’s drawings. About how much I missed her. About how I was sorry for closing the door.

I fell asleep there.

When I woke up in the morning, there was a new drawing on the nightstand. I didn’t remember Iris coming in, but it was clearly her work. It showed the woman in the red dress and the small child. But this time, there was a third figure. Another woman, kneeling down, arms open. The two figures were walking toward her.

Underneath, in Iris’s careful handwriting, it said: “The lady says thank you. She can rest now.”

Iris doesn’t draw the woman and the child anymore. She’s back to dinosaurs and princesses and horses with impossible legs. Emma and I keep Lily’s door open. We say her name. We remember.

But sometimes, late at night, I still hear that lullaby. Soft and distant, like an echo of something that used to be. And I wonder if the shadow was ever really gone, or if she’s just quiet now. Satisfied that someone is still carrying her little flower forward into a future she never got to see.

I wonder if that’s what ghosts really are. Not the dead haunting the living, but the living haunting themselves. The love that has nowhere to go, taking shape in the empty spaces of a closed room, a packed box, a name we’re afraid to say.

Iris starts third grade next week. She’s excited. She picked out a new backpack. Yellow, with bees on it.

I didn’t have the heart to tell her no.
