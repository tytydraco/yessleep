It wasn't too long after moving into this house that I began to notice something strange. You see, a few months ago, I was offered a position with the company I work for as the new general manager of a branch opening up in a somewhat remote area of West Virginia. It might not sound that appealing to some of you, but a general manager's salary in Appalachia goes a lot further than a general employee's salary does in downtown Chicago. My one-bedroom apartment in Illinois was costing me more than three times the cost of the mortgage on my three-bedroom house here in Harper's Ferry. Regardless, I didn't have any personal ties keeping me in Chicago that were holding me back. No wife, no kids, no family in the area. I had been feeling a little claustrophobic being caught up in the rat race of the big city, and the idea of relocating to somewhere quieter with more space to myself sounded refreshing. Not to mention the nice promotion and salary increase that I was getting out of the deal.

The house isn't a mansion or anything, just a little two-story house on a small plot of land. There are other houses around, but they're quite spaced out a bit along a winding gravel back road that I live on. My nearest neighbors are the ones directly across from me, or at least, their driveway is directly across from mine. Their house actually sits back off the road quite a way, and I could just barely make out the shape of it past the trees that line their side of the street. They had come over to greet me on the day that I moved in, a sweet elderly couple with adult children that lived out of state. Both of them are retired and wanted to settle down somewhere that they could enjoy the peace and quiet of the mountains. And let me tell you, it is plenty quiet out here. Aside from the occasional car driving down the road or pack of roaming dogs meandering around, for the most part, there is almost no noise pollution whatsoever.

My first night here, after I had unloaded the rest of the boxes from my pickup truck, I just stood on my front porch and took a deep breath of the fresh mountain air. The only sound I could hear was the sound of the light wind rustling through the leaves high above me in the hundreds of trees surrounding the road in my property. I had never experienced something so peaceful and quiet living in the city, not even living in the suburbs as a kid with my parents decades ago. But there was also an unsettling quality to it. I guess for a city boy like me, the idea of the nearest person being at least half a mile away from you had put me on edge a bit. There's a comfort in knowing that if you needed help, you could just run outside your apartment and bang on your neighbor's door, or if you needed emergency services, there would probably be a station within a few city blocks of your location. The thought that if something happened to me, no one would likely find out about it for weeks always sat stewing in the back of my mind.

I made a mental note at the time that I wanted to get a dog or a cat to keep me company. Now that I owned my place, I wasn't bound to the restrictions of pet deposits or leash laws anymore. I figured that it would be nice to have a little fluffy creature waiting for me when I got home from work every evening, or at least it would certainly break up the solitude of living by myself out in the countryside. Regardless, I settled in pretty quickly and was beginning to adjust to my new way of life faster than I first intended to. The opening of my job's new location went smoothly, and I was getting along pretty well with my new co-workers.
