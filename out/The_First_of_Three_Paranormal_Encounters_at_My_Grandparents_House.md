Growing up, I often visited my grandparents’ house. They lived only about fifteen minutes away, so my parents didn’t see much of a problem with my siblings and me staying the night. It was an old house tucked deep in the woods—trees stretching for miles and miles in every direction. My grandpa used to joke, “I could kill a man and bury him in my backyard, and nobody would ever know.” It was obviously meant as humor, but given how dense and isolated those woods were, I wouldn’t doubt that someone living there could get away with it.

I’m writing this because my doctor says journaling helps process trauma. But that’s not the real reason. I’m writing because no one else will listen. Because if I don’t tell this the way it happened, it’ll rot inside me like everything else connected to that house.

One night, when I was about nine or ten years old, my parents drove the whole family over to Grandma and Grandpa’s for a nice dinner. Nothing felt unusual about that evening. It was mid-December, and my brother and I were already out of school until after New Year’s. Like any excited kids, we begged to stay the night. My parents agreed and left briefly to grab our pajamas.

That’s when my grandpa sat my brother and me down and asked, “Do you wanna hear a scary story?”

Of course, we said yes.

I was very close to my grandfather and always enjoyed whatever silly or mischievous activity he had planned. But this—this was the turning point. I still remember his story in vivid detail.

“Not so long ago,” he began, “there was a man who made a large sum of money. He was a well-known businessman in town, but behind closed doors, he was also a criminal. He did odd jobs for people who needed to ‘get things’ from places they weren’t supposed to. During one job, he suffered a severe accident—a gunshot wound to the head.”

At that moment, my sense of comfort vanished, replaced by fear and an unsettling curiosity.

“Despite the injury, the man survived,” my grandfather continued. “After that, he decided to leave his criminal life behind and live quietly with his wife. So he built a house in the middle of the woods. This very house.”

Even now, remembering that sentence sends chills down my spine.

“For the first few months, everything seemed fine,” he said. “The man enjoyed long walks along his property line, while his wife admired the scenery the woods had to offer. But the injury left him with severe mental problems. He would get lost inside his own house. He threatened neighbors with a shotgun, convinced they were after him. His wife once caught him stuffing pennies into holes he’d blasted into the walls.”

By then, my younger brother had slipped away to find our grandmother—he was too scared to stay. I don’t blame him. No child should hear a story like that. I was just as frightened, but I stayed. I don’t know why. I should’ve followed him, but I was completely captivated.

“The man had completely lost his mind,” my grandfather said quietly. “And it left his wife emotionally drained.”

“What happened to him, Grandpa?” I asked.

“Well,” he replied, “this is where there’s no real ending. One night, the neighbors across the street heard a loud shotgun blast from the house. They weren’t alarmed at first—they assumed he was having another episode. But what terrified them was the silence that followed. No second shot.”

“The neighbors went inside. The walls were riddled with holes—some from shotgun blasts, others drilled with tools. Pocket change littered the floors and filled the holes. The house was a mess, but the damage drew their attention upward—to an indoor balcony with a spiral staircase. They climbed it in fear.”

My grandfather swallowed before continuing.“When they opened the door at the end of the balcony, they were horrified. The man had blown his head off. Blood and brains painted the wall behind him.”

I felt sick just hearing it. The way he told it made it feel real—like I was standing there with them.

“The wife was nowhere to be found,” he went on. “Police investigated for weeks. The story became local legend. Some say the wife fled in fear. Others say she killed him to end his suffering. Either way, the ending is the same. The man was shot, and his wife disappeared.”

I still don’t understand why my grandfather told us that story—why he chose that night, or why he never told my parents. Sometimes I wonder if it was meant as harmless fun. After all, every night we stayed there, we slept in that room.

That night still haunts me. No one believes me when I talk about it, but I know what I heard. I know what I saw.

After the story, my grandmother led us upstairs to the bedroom. There was an old bunk bed—probably my mom’s from when she was little. She tucked us in and turned out the lights. I started on the bottom bunk, my brother on top. At some point in the night, we argued over switching places. It was stupid, childish. I wish I hadn’t fought him. He lost, and we switched.

From the top bunk, I could see the entire room.

Hours later, I noticed a small black figure standing in the doorway. I wasn’t afraid at first—I assumed it was my brother.

The figure stood there for several minutes.

“Hello?” I whispered.

“Hi.” it replied.

“What are you doing?”

“I was waiting.”

“What for?”

“I’m waiting to play. Everyone’s asleep, and it’s not fun.”

I still thought it was my brother.

“You’re new here,” it said. “I thought you’d be different from the other two downstairs.”

That’s when fear locked my body in place.

“Those are my grandparents,” I said, trying to stay calm. “They’re older. They need more rest.”

“Why?”

“You just get sleepier when you’re older, I guess.”

The figure began moving closer. Floorboards creaked softly as it approached the bunk bed.

“Do you ever get tired?” I asked, my voice shaking.

“No. Not anymore.” 

Then I couldn’t see it anymore—but I could hear it.

“Why are you here tonight?” it asked.

“We wanted to spend the night. We like visiting our grandparents.”

“Do you love them?”

“Yes,” I said. “My grandpa’s fun, and my grandma makes good food.”

The creaking stopped.

“Then why don’t you stay here?”

Suddenly, the mattress beneath me shifted. A heavy weight pressed down on the lower bunk.

“So we can play all the time.”

I felt my heart pounding. I wanted my parents. I didn’t know whether to scream.

“I can’t,” I said. “I live with my parents.”

The weight shifted again. Cold air brushed my feet. I knew it was climbing toward me.

“Do you not like me?” it asked.

“No—I like you,” I whispered.

“Then stay. You can be with me and your grandparents.”

I snapped.

“No! I can’t stay! My parents would miss me! I can’t play with you!”

The cold retreated. The weight lifted.

“Okay,” it said calmly.

Silence followed. I thought it was gone.

Then a whisper brushed my ear.

“I hope they won’t miss your brother.”

I screamed.

I ran downstairs and burst into my grandparents’ room, sobbing about the shadow.

“I told you not to tell them that stupid story!” my grandma yelled.

“Oh hush,” my grandpa said. “The boy is just scared of the dark.

They gave me a snack and carried me back upstairs. When they turned on the lights, they froze.

A massive bloodstain covered the bottom bunk. The window was open.

I don’t remember much after that. The police came. My parents screamed. My mother cried. The police questioned me. At the time, I thought it was because I was the last person with Caleb. Now I think they suspected me.

They searched for him.

It’s been ten years. They never found my brother.

My family fell apart. We moved away—from my grandparents, from the woods, from the accusations. People called me freak and murderer. In the city, no one knew. I was just Will.

I wish I could say that was the end of it.

But I wouldn’t be writing this from a psych ward if it were.

What I saw was real. Everything was real. And if you know what’s fucking good for you, you’ll destroy that house. Burn it down.

Just don’t let anyone else go inside.

Because he will get you.
