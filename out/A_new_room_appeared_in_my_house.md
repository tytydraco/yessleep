A new room appeared in my house

This all started a few years ago,during the pandemic to be specific.It was a rough time for everyone back then,but for me it was even worse. My wife had left me a couple of months before the quarantine was imposed,and that was pretty hard on me, but at least I had my job and the few friends I had in the city to distract myself with.Even then, the loneliness of having to live by myself in the house I used to share with the person I'd thought I'd spent the rest of my life with was really tought deal with.And then ,as you can probably imagine, the pandemic made everything a hundred times worse.

I couldn't go to work and I couldn't see my friends because of the quarantine measures,so the only thing I had left was sitting and rotting away at home by myself.My life had become this empty cycle of waking up, watching sitcoms all day,eating my microwaved dinner and going back to sleep.It was soulcrushing.
After a week or so, I started going out jogging at night because I read an online article saying it helps with mental health.Thats how I saw it for the first time.

I was coming back from my run when I noticed a light coming from the wall on the side of my house.This was strange,not only because I was certain I'd turned everything off before going out,but also because I knew for a fact there was no window on that wall.I started walking faster because I was quite weirded out.When I got closer ,I also noticed that the light coming out from the window was different from the one the lights in the house usually produced-sort of orange and warm ,but also somehow...dirty.When I came in the house I saw that, as I thought, I hadn't left the lights on in any of the rooms.My hands shaking,I walked towards where that window should be-the wall alongside the staircase between the two floors of the house. And there,the place where just last morning there was nothing but smooth white plaster ,I found a door.It had a strange metalwork design on it , and the handle had a weird shape, like a zig-zag line.

I could see the weird orange light coming from under the doorstep,but I could also hear sounds coming from the other side. It sounded like someone was talking,but there was something wrong with their speech,like they had some fluid in their throat or something.I stood there,equal parts horrified and dumbfounded,when I heard steps coming towards the door.Immediately I turned around and started running down the stairs.After tripping and almost breaking my neck I ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife .I got back to the foot of the stairs,waiting,but no one came down.

However,the noises had gotten louder-it was the same gurgling speech,but now there were more voices and they sounded like they were recorded,like they were coming out of a TV or something.
Anyway,as there was nothing I could do and nowhere I could go,and I didn't seem to be in any immediate danger, I just poured myself a drink and went to sleep on the couch in my living room.I thought about calling the police,but I was half-sure that this whole thing was just a product of some isolation-induced psychosis,and I didn't want the cops to put me  in an asylum or something.
The door was still there the next day,and the noises started again at night,but it didn't bother me, so I just started to ignore it after a while.
Where everything went wrong was about a week or so after that first incident.I was doomscrolling on my phone,and then I came across my ex-wife's profile and...yeah you know how it goes.Two minutes later I was going through our old photos and crying huddled on my couch.It was just getting dark,so it was hearing the noises from the stairway that brought me back to the present.

It sounded like laughter,like someone was having a real good time over there.I don't know what came over me,maybe that was the point where all the loneliness and sadness broke my mind, but I decided to finally check what was on the other side.Maybe I was hoping to find a friend, or maybe I was hoping for it all to finally end, I don't know.Either way ,I got to the door and pulled on the weirdly shaped handle.

The first thing I noticed about the room before me was that the layout was very similar to that of my living room downstairs,down to the placement of the furniture.It did not feel familiar or welcoming,though-everything else in there seemed bizarre and disturbing.
The wallpaper,the heavy carpet and the ceiling were all decorated with geometrical patterns that were so bizarre and alien that I started getting dizzy after looking at them  .Everything was painted in colours that I did not recognize.Not like a new shade or a mixture of other colors-literally a new spectrum of light.

The weirdest thing in the room, though, was the show that was playing on the TV.Except it wasn't quite a TV, more like mishapen black box with a black and white screen in the middle,and it wasn't playing anything I could accurately describe.It was like one of these AI things you keep seeing nowadays-like a bad approximation of what something inhuman thinks humanity is like.The"characters" had weird facial expression , moved like their limbs didn't quite work and were speaking gibberish the whole time.Worst of all was the obnoxious laughtrack track that played after every nonsensical line.I was still trying to wrap my head around what I was hearing when I heard a different noise-footseps,coming from behind another door I hadn't seen at the far corner of the room .I bolted toward the exit immediately,but to my horror, it was locked and wouldn't budge.I was still trying to pry it open when the room's resident walked in.

Like everything else there ,it almost resembled something human,until you took a closer look and realized something was very wrong.It  was way too tall and the proportions of its limbs and body were way off.It's clothes didn't fit it's body at all,though they did resemble something a human could wear.
It had ashy-gray skin and two bulging fish-like yellow eyes.I frozen in place,too terrified to even breathe,which seemed to have helped because the thing didn't notice me at first.It walked in with its shoulders slumped and it's face contorted in a grimace that almost looked like a human frown.It was mumbling something to itself when it sat down in front of the TV,with a bowl filled with some kind of black slop in it's hands.

When it came closer to me,I could hear that the sounds it was making sounded a lot like crying.I still had nowhere to go,so I was forced to stand still and observe what the creature was doing.After staring at the TV for a while it started shaking,producing sounds that now sounded like some inhuman stifled laughter.After slurping down the black fluid it was holding, the creature huddled onto the piece of furniture it was previously sitting on,and the crying sounds returned.
Thats when it hit me -this creature,this thing was immitating me.It was making a farce of the shitshow my life had become, and I was being forced to watch it.

This was when all my fear turned into rage.I was obviously not mentally sound at the time,so I hope you do not judge my next actions too harshly,dumb as they might have been.I charged towards the imitator yelling and swinging my fists,tears of anger and helplessness streaming down my face.When I tried to hit it though, my arm simply...sunk into it.It was like reaching into wet mud.With some of my common sense returning from the shock, I tried to back away,but I was stuck.Thats when the creature stood up .I tried to push away with all my strength,but it pulled me closer,and now my whole body was sinking into its torso.

And then it started speaking to me.
It was that same gurgling speech I had heard from behind the door,only now it was somewhat understandable.
"Fwuh...Fwhriend...Noo longer alone...frieend"
My face was now almost entirely absorbed into its body,so I just stopped struggling.I accepted this was the end,but surprisingly I also realized that I didn't want to die,despite what I had told myself in my loneliest moments.
That's when I noticed that in our struggle,we had come right next to the window.The same window that had started all of this.I swung my left arm,the only part of my body that was still free,and broke the window with my fist. Fighting through the pain of the glass shards digging into my arm,I managed to grab onto the outer edge and pull myself forward.I fell out the window, and the last thing I remember is spinning through the air with realization in my head that the thing had finally let go of me.
I woke up a few months later in a hospital bed.At first I thought I was waking up from a dream,until I saw the healed cuts on my arm and the black sludge covering the clothes and shoes I had been wearing when they rushed me into the hospital.
The good news was that while I was in a coma the pandemic had passed.The bad news was that it looked a lot like I had made a an attempt on my life, so I did end up making that trip to a mental institution that had stopped me from calling the cops the first time.

Funnily enough, the help I got there is what helped me turn my life around.I managed to start over,met a new girl I really like, and I feel truly happy for the first time in a while.I sold the house,of course,even though the door wasn't there when I came back.Still, I can't help but wonder-was that thing actually trying to hurt me back then...or was it just giving me what I had been asking for.
