I was burn with a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 1 that can cause scoliosis, tumors, and it could take a little while longer for your brain to fully developed

 I've never had a mother figure in life. 

My mom went to prison.

 My brothers on my mom side live in a different state.

 I was Pick on through out most of my life by teachers and students.

 A teacher said I hope you choke on it referring to popcorn because I said I'm not voting for you for teacher of the year.

 A teacher put me in a office/closet when the power is out because I said call my dad repeatedly and because they wait my grandma had to get me.

 I saw a kid in pe collapse and the next school day maybe a few school days later he passed.

 My grandpa passed a week before my 21st birthday (burn on Aug 1 2000) and 6 or 7 months later at the end of February I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor called non-hodgkin lymphoma cell b and went through chmeo therapy.

 I was in the hospital for 9 days. 

3 days after er visit I was on chmeo. 

I was on it for 5 days a week once every 3 weeks

I can't see people outside of my home when I'm on it and up to 10 days or 2 weeks when I'm off of it.

 I was on chmeo for 6 rounds 20hrs and off chmeo 4hrs with meds in vain (at home by mouth) for 5 days a week on chmeo and 3 weeks off chmeo.

Before I went to the ER I weighed 125 , 9 days later (at home) I weighed 113 , I finished chemo at the end of June 2022 and turned 22 less then 2 months later I was 22.

I ask a nurce am I going to die and she said to me we all are going to die

My dad fault for me in court because my mom was an unfit mother when I was 2.

I have a dent in/on my head.

I am a black belt at taekwondo.

I think when I am alone and/or when I am stressed.

Something I use grass to help me not feel stress.

I have been questioning my mental health.

About the cancer I had if I waited a month (maybe 2 weeks) I probably would not be alive and I had a a biopsy, a drainage tube, tumors was 191mm (over 6 inches) I've been through a lot.

I was told that iis a miracle that I'm still here, the tumor was so big it was restricting the blood flow to my head.
Will it be a good idea If I see a mental health expert because of what I went through? I would like to read your comments so I can read your opinions.

I hope this post is long enough so I can post on here right now I'm just adding more ston here so that way I can have a higher chance of posting this to this subreddit I hope I reach over 500 word's so I can finally post this and I hope you all have a fantastic day, I hope you found my story interesting.
