My grandfather lay dying in our house, being eaten alive from the inside by cancer. His face was sunken, his trembling, arthritic hands looking like claws as he reached out for my shirt and pulled me down closer to his mouth. I stared into his intelligent brown eyes, but they looked like they were already dead- like doll’s eyes. They barely moved, just staring straight up at me, all hope and life being stripped away from him in his final days.

“Xavier,” he said to me slowly, chewing the word. “I am so glad you are here with me. I don’t want to be alone.” I shook my head, trying to keep tears from streaming down my face. I blinked quickly, clearing them away.

“I would never leave you alone like this,” I said, grabbing his hand. It felt cold and brittle, the bones feeling like those of a bird underneath his thin, papery skin. “You’re my grandpa. I love you. We all love you.” He nodded.

“There’s a lot you don’t know about our family,” he said. “A lot that I need to tell you before I go. I always wanted to put it off before, thinking to myself that there would be another day, another better time to tell you. But I know now that it isn’t true. There will never be a better time to tell you, and I may not have another day.” He turned away from me, coughing violently. Spasms rocked his thin body as he gasped for air. Pulling out a handkerchief he always carried around, he wiped his lips. The white cloth came away with bright red trails. He was coughing up blood almost constantly now. As he gulped in another breath, I went to the nightstand next to his bed and pulled out a pill of morphine and another of ibuprofen to give to him. He waved me away.

“Just the ibuprofen is fine,” he said. “I need to keep a clear head for what’s coming.”

“But what’s coming, grandpa?” I asked, pouring an ice-cold pitcher of lemon water into a glass and dropping the pill into his hand. He took it, sipping at the water slowly, then appeared to feel better.

“The ferryman,” he said. “And he is going to want payment.”

This is the story my grandfather told me when I was a little boy. He used to sit by my bed at night before I went to sleep, sometimes reading Dr. Seuss or Roald Dahl to me, but other times he would tell me stories. He was originally a massive man- well over 6 feet tall with bulging muscles from working in construction his whole life. His eyes were always bright, curious and compassionate. But in the end, the cancer and arthritis took all of that away from him.

“Many years ago,” he began, sitting in a chair next to my bed, no longer reading but looking up at the ceiling, his brown eyes twinkling as he recited the story by heart, “there was a boy. He liked to play outside a lot. He would spend all day in the forests near his house, and every night, he would come back dirty, scraped-up, smelling like pine sap and sweat- but he loved it. He tried to explore deeper and deeper.

“His father had died mysteriously, so he only had a mother. The mother was a nice woman, but she always worried about her son.

“‘Don’t go out in the sun,’ she would tell him, ‘because sunlight causes cancer.’ ‘Don’t be around cigarette smoke,’ she said, ‘because even just being around it will kill you.’ ‘Don’t eat red meat,’ she once said, ‘because that will kill you too.’ But the boy would just smile, nod and think about his time in the forest. He knew his mother only worried because she loved him, you see.

“On a Sunday, after church, he changed his clothes and ran out farther in the woods than he had ever gone. He ended up losing the main trail along the way, following what looked like a deer trail for miles. Yet, someone had clearly been there before him. An eye surrounded by a clawed hand was carved into a tree every few hundred feet. The marks looked fresh.

“Ahead of him loomed a cave. It had a monstrous black mouth. Torches blazed along both sides of the walls further in. He had a bad feeling, but he was just a little boy, you understand. He went inside.

“The cave floor descended rapidly. The torches kept throwing off their eerie shadows all around him. A smell like sulfur extended from further up ahead, and occasionally, he heard eerie screaming that echoed back to him from far away. But he wanted, *needed*, to know what this place was, so he kept going forwards.

“After about half an hour of walking, he found himself at a subterranean river. There was a little ferryman’s boat on it, abandoned- for now, at least. It had a long stick and two oars. It didn’t look like any boat he had ever seen. It looked like those he had seen in the history textbooks from ancient Egypt- curved, almost like a banana, with strange hieroglyphics of eyes and half-human, half-animal beings painted on all sides. Laughing with glee, he jumped in. But as he did, he realized that someone had written on all the cave walls next to the boat. Many languages existed there. Looking around, he saw writing in English nearby, huge, spiky letters that covered the wall from fifteen feet up to the ground floor. And, being intrigued, he read it.

&#x200B;

“Those who wish to cross

Must now pay their respect.

First, suffer a loss

In coinage- or in death.

&#x200B;

“If you do not heed

The warning herein written,

Then surely all your greed

Will cause you to first sicken.

&#x200B;

“Next will come the dreams

Of horrors that are blind,

The cracking of the beams

Holding up your mind.

&#x200B;

“Last will come your death.

We will take your body back.

When you finish every breath,

Nyx makes your eyes turn black.”

&#x200B;

“Now, this little boy didn’t know what a ‘Nyx’ was, or who had written the poems in dozens of languages, or whose boat it was. But he was intensely curious to see what was on the other side of this shore. So he pushed himself off with the stick, using the oars to cross the river. The screaming and echoes had all stopped, at least for now, and all he heard was the soft splashing of the oars as he paddled across the river.

“As he got to the other side and dismounted, he realized he had made a terrible mistake. There were bodies everywhere- bodies of men, women and children, bodies of animals, bodies of half-human, half-animal creatures that don’t exist in our world. And all of them were mummified, wrapped up in pure white gauze, only their heads visible. Their eyes were all closed, looking peaceful and happy. When he stepped foot outside the boat onto the shore, however, the eyes of all of them flashed open in an instant. The creaking of their old joints was the only thing he could hear when they turned their heads to look at him, hissing and screaming in unison.

“From farther on in the cave, he heard the running of feet. A man with pale, cracked flesh falling off all over his body shrieked like someone being burned alive, his mouth falling open and showing countless broken teeth.

“‘Boy,’ the figure cried in a deep, terrible voice, ‘boy, give me the payment. Where is your payment? Coins or death, boy. Coins or death. I am the Ferryman, and I need your payment.’

“Scared witless, the boy jumped back into the boat and immediately began paddling back to the other shore as fast as he could. But, as he drew near, the thing had grabbed the rope and began pulling the boat back. In a panic, the boy leaped out of the boat and began to swim the last ten feet.

“He felt cold, dead hands trying to grab him from the bottom of the river. They dragged him under. Water filled his lungs as he began to drown. Kicking with all of his strength, in a blind panic, he managed to get them to release him and finally got away, losing both of his shoes in the process. The screaming of all the mummified, tortured beings followed him as he ran, soaking wet and terrified, back to the entrance.

“Son, *I* was that boy, and I have paid for it many times since then. I should have never gone down in that cave.”

This story always terrified me. After my grandpa kissed me goodnight, I was hiding under the covers, shaking in fear, thinking about the horrible story he had told me and hoping it was just that- a story.

\*\*\*

My grandfather tried to turn in his deathbed, his weak frame barely holding him up as he shifted his weight. He looked up at me, tears in his eyes.

“I’m sorry, Xavier,” he said. “You know the story, and, while you may not believe it, it is true. I thought it was just some nightmarish hallucination, maybe a one-time epileptic fit or something, and I convinced myself of that for years. And then my mother, your great-grandmother, died, and the poem came true.

“She was in hospice care at our home, just like I am now, and when she took her last breath and her eyes closed in peace, I exhaled a sigh of relief. I had constant nightmares about that creature, the owner of the boat, the ferryman, coming back in a rage. I had dreams about bodies rising from the dead, their eyes black and full of hatred.

“All I could hear was my heart beating in my chest and my rapid breathing as I watched my mother’s corpse. And then, after a minute, her eyes flew back open- totally black now. Her joints creaked as she moved her head to look straight at me. With a guttural cry, she wrapped her hands around my neck and tried to choke me to death.

“I ended up grabbing a syringe from the table next to her bed and stabbing her- well, I guess it was really now an ‘it’- in the eye. She finally released me, and I fell back, choking and gasping. But she rose from the bed, now able to walk again, an old, withered puppet being controlled by something beyond my comprehension, something evil, something that wanted payment for what I had accidentally done as a little kid. And she chased me, Xavier. She chased me upstairs. I locked myself in my room, grabbing my little .22 that I used for plinking and target practice. I ended up having to shoot my own mother’s body in the head five times before she fell back down, unmoving. Her eyes were still pure black, however, and they would stay that way, even as we buried her.

“I talked to some historians who knew ancient history, and while they clearly didn’t believe my story, they told me that cultures long ago put coins on the eyes of their dead to pay the Ferryman. I tried it. Every time another cousin or uncle or aunt died, I made sure to put two pure silver coins over their closed eyes, as soon as they took their last breath. And it worked. The ferryman never came back for me.

“You need to do this, too. When I die, put the coins over my eyes, or he will take control of my body, like he did to so many before me.” I scoffed at this, but I could see he was in a lot of pain and fear. I nodded.

“Sure, grandpa, I’ll make sure to put coins on your eyes.” But I knew it was just some delirious conviction of a dying man. Of course, I wasn’t going to put coins over his eyes.

My grandfather died an hour later, and that was when everything went wrong.
