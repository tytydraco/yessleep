3:01 a.m.

Ive had an eerie feeling all day, the psychic I saw earlier told me to remember the time 3:01 a.m. I never was one to believe in these things I just went so my friend was happy. I finally crawled into bed dreading the next day to come as I had a huge work project to present it was 9:00 pm exactly and the whole time I waited to fall asleep I felt something watching me I heard weird noises as well. I finally convinced myself it was nothing maybe just my cat and drifted off to sleep..I struggled to stay asleep however, I just couldn't shake that feeling. I kept hearing scratching and heavy breathing I contributed the scratching to my cat and the breathing to me being sick.

3:01 a.m. that's what my clock read as I saw my closet door squeaking open..I sat up and tried to turn my bedside lamp on no luck. I muttered to myself thinking the power must be out. That's when I saw it. Those beady yellow eyes from the closet door my heart started pounding as I saw her coming out of the closet she was tall and slender with long fingernails and a mouth so wide filled with razor sharp teeth. I froze my heart started pounding I didn't think she saw me yet. I was wrong she was coming right towards me. I tried to scream but no sound came out. She crawled on my bed on all fours hovering over me drool dripping from her bloody sharp teeth. I accepted my fate knowing this would be the last time I will ever open my eyes I said a prayer to myself in my head as she dug her nails into me slicing my stomach open I didn't even try and fight this creature I knew I couldn't she was too strong, I laid there in agony and pain trying to scream as she ripped my organs out one by one finally she sunk her teeth into them I watched in and out of consciousness as she ate my organs I said one more prayer as she dug her teeth into my lungs I gasped my last breath and then lights out. I jolted awake thanking God it was just a nightmare. My clock read 3:00 a.m. as I laid there in the darkness trying to catch my breath I saw those blinking red numbers turn to 3:01 a.m. that's when I heard my closet door squeak open...and I realized my nightmare was about to come true...
My last thought being maybe I should have believed that psychic as I saw those beady yellow eyes coming towards me. 

The End.
