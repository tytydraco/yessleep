There she was. My everything. Lying on the floor, her eyes blank as if all the light had been pumped out of them. 11 years together, one wrong move, and now she was gone.  
  
She was lying on the floor with her arm ripped off. Her leg was bent at a painful angle that wasn't humanely possible. Her gruesome insides were splattered everywhere.

  
We met on one fine day when we were just kids. Well atleast I was. She, she was just something else.....  
Because she wasn't human.  
But I fell in love, the moment I saw her. There was this connection, and before long, I started dreaming of all the amazing adventures we would have together.

  
Only that she didn't live long enough for them.

  
I never thought she could die, or that it was possible for her.  
But she was dead now, and it was all my fault.  
  
One of her eyeballs had been torn apart and was rolling beside her, its empty socket on a horrid display. Her head was snapped off her body. She looked so mangled, it looked as if something had taken a bite out of her.  
  
Because it had.  
  
And it was now standing infront of me, her insides in it's mouth, looking at me with its black void-like eyes that showed no remorse.

  
Long ago, I made a mistake. A mistake that came to haunt me again years later.  
I fell in love. With someone else.

Something else would do justice, since it wasn't a human either.

  
The someone else was the most beautiful creature I had ever seen, with golden hair and a smile that could melt your heart.

How I managed to meet it, I don't know. When we had met, It was living deep in the forest near to my home, it's body covered in dirt.

But I helped it, even if it was small.

And slowly I fell in love.  
It loved me and the feeling was mutual. It was wonderful.

  
Did I feel guilty for cheating on my previous love? I did, but I still kept going.

  
I loved both of them but my golden haired love was too innocent and sweet.  
Only it wasn't.  
And now my sweet love, who loved me even when I had locked her up in the basement, was gone.  
  
A harmless toy, that is what she was to the monster that I fell in love with. Just something that can be torn apart easily. And now I was next.  
  
It jumped on me, just like it had on her.  
  
She was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Ever since childhood, she was mine. And now she was gone.  
  
No amount of operations or stitching can bring her back.  
  
She was gone.  
  
My useless and innocent Labrador had tore my only doll, the one that I had for so long.

And now I can't stitch her back.

My dog is currently looking at me, feeling proud at the damage she has done. She is giving me kisses right now, as if that will bring my doll back.

And the doll was expensive as well.
