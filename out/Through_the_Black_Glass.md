To confirm, you want to record my story?

Don’t say any names?

Don’t give locations?

It’s already on file?

Okay. I understand. I am still extremely shaken by it. My head can’t wrap around it. I still can’t believe it happened. But if you say it's important…

Well. I used to work as a lifeguard at a small rec center in a small town. It would always get busy during the late morning and early afternoon. You would see families with children playing in the shallow end of the pool, enjoying life during a hot summer day. Parents would sit on the edge, chatting and keeping a watchful eye on their kids. The sound of laughter and splashing water filled the air.

Athletes would also use the other pool to swim laps or do diving practices. You know, it’s refreshing to hear them practice during the day. I love hearing the rhythmic sound of their splashes as they push themselves. That’s what I want to be in the future, a professional swimmer. Well, probably not anymore considering what happened to me. So being a lifeguard, at the time, was the closest thing I could do to feel like I am doing something in my life that marginally matches my dreams.

Sorry. I detracted there.

That day was no different. I was the last lifeguard to wrap everything up the hour before closing and before the cleaning staff would arrive. While examining the pool for any last-minute swimmers, I noticed a strange reflection of light at the bottom of the other pool in the diving section. Fortunately, well actually unfortunately, there was no one else but me, so I swam down there to check it out.

It looked like black glass that was starting to spread from that corner of the pool. I tried to pry it out but felt stuck to the surface. Maybe a kid pranked us by gluing this thing to the bottom of the pool? At the time, it seemed like that rather than some weird thing growing there.

Just before I decided to surface for air and try again, I noticed a tiny little chip right beside it. Thinking nothing of it, I picked it up and swam to the surface.

As I swam up, it seemed much, much longer than I anticipated to reach the surface. I almost ran out of breath. My lungs were burning, and I started to panic, kicking harder and harder. But no matter how much I swam, the surface seemed to get further away.

Then, suddenly, everything changed. I broke through the surface, gasping for air, but instead of the familiar pool, I found myself in the middle of a murky green ocean. The water was cold, thick, and had a strange, almost slimy texture. I looked around, and there was no land in sight, just endless stretches of perfectly still water. Eerily still. The only disturbance was from me, trying to keep afloat.

When I looked up, I remember seeing that the sky was black. Not just black, no stars, no clouds, no moonlight. It was purely black, like an endless void. It was disorienting and terrifying. The only sound was the gentle splashing from my body treading water, and the silence was deafening.

I tried to stay calm, but my mind was racing. How did I get here? What was happening? I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized I was completely alone in this strange, dark world.

My panic went through the roof. I looked around frantically, trying to confirm what I was seeing was real. I mean, at the time, it felt like this can’t be happening. It’s just unbelievable. That’s when I saw the island.

It was strange. I may have missed it during my frantic state, but I swore there was no land near me for miles… initially. That island was weird. It felt off… unnatural maybe. I had a strong feeling that someone was watching me from that island.

When I squinted my eyes, I could see that it had a tower, I guess. A very, very tall one. It felt as tall as the Empire State Building back in New York. This tower was showing off all sorts of strange colors. It could have been red or purple or black or green. Might have been all at once. The colors seemed to pulse and shift, casting eerie reflections on the water.

All of a sudden, it stopped changing colors. It turned black. For some reason, I started to panic, as if it became a threat to my very existence. My basic human instincts of fight or flight kicked in. So, figuring that it was an island, I looked around to see what dangers lurked near me. The water felt colder, and my skin prickled with fear. My heart was pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears.

When I turned back to look at the island, it looked like it moved closer. A lot closer. It definitely got bigger in my vision. How the hell does an island move like that? Well, nothing on earth ever does this. Especially an island. Time seemed to stretch, each second feeling like an eternity as I tried to make sense of what was happening.

Then I heard it. A large splash. I turned around and saw this thing jump out of the water from a distance, maybe a mile or so. I don’t know. It looked like a fish jumping out of the water, except the body was grey, and it had a very large fin.

My heart pounded in my chest. Was that a shark? Was that a great white shark? It really looked like a predator. I felt a chill run down my spine. I had to know for sure, so I put my head under the water.

For a kind of slimy water, it was really clear. I could see for miles. As I looked around, I noticed there were no other fish, just an eerie emptiness. An unnatural light seemed to shine through the water, casting an otherworldly glow. It illuminated the depths, revealing what looked like a bottomless ocean. The water below me faded into an inky blackness, as if there was no end to it. The contrast between the glowing water and the dark abyss was unsettling, making the vastness of the ocean feel even more oppressive. It was as if the light was highlighting the sheer emptiness and the unknown dangers lurking in the depths.

That’s when I saw it swimming towards me. It looked like a shark, and it was coming in fast. I could almost make out its teeth. That smile… I never want to see that smile ever again.

Panic surged through me. My breathing became rapid and shallow. I turned quickly and saw that the island was suddenly extremely close to me. Maybe 100 feet from it. Like, I was within swimming distance. I felt I could swim to it for safety.

But my instincts told me that it was a trap. It felt like I would die either in the water or on land.

Looking under the water to see my options, I saw what looked like the ceiling of the rec center at the bottom of this murky water. Is that where I came from? It looked farther than the island. Maybe twice as far.

I didn’t hesitate. That’s when I started to swim like a madman to it. It was do or die at this point. My arms and legs moved frantically, the water resistance making every stroke feel like a battle. The cold water stung my skin, and my muscles burned with the effort. The shark was getting closer, and I could feel its presence looming behind me.

All the while swimming, I felt a strong sense of anger and dread coming from the island, as if it was infuriated with my choice to swim down. Then, I heard roars of lightning above me and felt the calm water perturbed by the sudden storm. I had to reach that ceiling, my only hope of escape.

With every ounce of strength I had left, I propelled myself towards the ceiling. The water seemed to grow thicker, and my vision blurred, but I kept pushing forward. The shark was almost upon me, its massive form cutting through the water with terrifying speed.

Just as I thought I couldn't go any further, my hand touched something solid. The ceiling of the rec center! I pushed against it, and suddenly, I was pulled through, as if the water itself had decided to let me go. It felt like being sucked through a narrow tunnel, the pressure around me increasing and then releasing all at once. My body was yanked upward with a force that left me disoriented.

I broke through the surface, gasping for air, and found myself back in the familiar surroundings of the rec center lap pool. The water was clear, the lights were bright, and the echoes of the splashing water filled my ears.

However, I didn’t want to be in the water. I still felt like I was in danger. So, I scrambled madly to the nearest ladder and climbed up. My hands were shaking as I gripped the cold metal rungs, my feet slipping on the wet steps. I could feel the water dragging at my legs, as if trying to pull me back in.

I hauled myself up the ladder and onto the tiled floor, my body collapsing in a heap. The tiles were cold and hard against my skin, but I didn’t care. I was out of the water. I was safe. Or so I thought.

In those few seconds, there was a sudden splash of water behind me. I turned just in time to see the shark lunging at my leg, its jaws snapping shut inches away. I kicked out instinctively, my foot connecting with its snout, and it recoiled back into the pool with a furious thrash.

It was in the pool, and I was finally on the floor, choking on air. But I quickly crawled to the nearest wall to keep distance from that thing. My heart was pounding, and my breaths came in ragged gasps. I pressed my back against the wall, my eyes never leaving the water, waiting for the next attack.

I saw the shark, floating at the top of the pool, looking at me. Those eyes were as black as night itself. Its body was made of a dull glass. Crystal maybe. I don’t know. I could see that it wasn’t round or smooth like other sharks you see in images. Its skin was jagged and angular, reflecting the light in strange, unsettling ways. The edges of its fins looked sharp, almost like blades, and its mouth was filled with rows of razor-sharp teeth that seemed to glint menacingly. It was massive, easily the size of a great white shark, its presence dominating the pool.

The shark's presence was unnerving. It moved with an eerie grace, gliding through the water as if it were stalking me. Every time it turned, the light would catch on its crystalline body, casting eerie reflections on the pool walls. I could feel its gaze fixed on me; those black eyes filled with some unnatural intelligence. It was as if the shark was waiting for the right moment to strike, and I knew I had to stay as far away from it as possible.

That’s when I heard the familiar voice of Linda. She shouted, “Who’s there? The pool is closed.”

I called out, “It’s me! I need help.”

As I turned around to examine the shark, it disappeared. Vanished. I slowly crept towards the edge of the pool and saw that it was empty. Only the black glass at the bottom remained.

I don’t remember what happened afterward. Linda found me in such a frantic and disoriented state. She rushed over, her face pale with worry. “Oh my God, where have you been? We’ve been looking for you everywhere!” she cried.

She told me that I had been missing for two weeks. By God, I couldn’t comprehend that. Two weeks of my life, gone! How?

At least I was alive, that’s for damn sure.

I stayed in the hospital for a few days. They told me that I had some water in my lungs and that I needed monitoring. No surprise there. The doctors and nurses were kind, but I could see the curiosity in their eyes. They wanted to know where I had been, but I had no answers.

Then, something strange started happening. My skin began to harden in patches, turning rough and almost stone-like. The doctors were baffled. They ran tests, but they couldn’t explain it. The hardening seemed to spread slowly, and it was unlike anything they had ever seen. It was as if my body was reacting to the water from that other world.

My boss, Jean, and the police visited me later. I was told that a missing persons claim was filed due to my sudden disappearance. The surveillance cameras showed me jumping into the water but never coming out. The footage was eerie, like watching a ghost.

They told me that this was redirected to the federal level as it was outside their expertise.

And that’s where you both come in. Both of you contacted me and wanted to know what happened. I know it sounds crazy, but believe me, this is what I experienced.

Wait, what? A facility? You want to take me to a facility to keep me safe?

I guess it’s somewhat comforting to know there are more people like me who went through this unholy experience. It’s hard to believe, but knowing I’m not alone gives me a sliver of hope.

Thank you! Please do whatever you can to reverse whatever is happening to my body. I can feel it. The hardening of my skin. The stiffening of my bones. I feel like a statue every day. It’s like my body is turning against me, and I’m terrified of what I might become.
Anyways, I can’t handle a normal life right now, seeing what’s happening to me. Every day is a struggle, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep going like this.

And certainly, I don’t want to be anywhere near any body of water ever again. The thought of it sends chills down my spine. I just want to feel safe and normal again.
