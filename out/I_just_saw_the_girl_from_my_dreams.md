I don’t know when it started, but for the past few years the same girl has been in every single one of my dreams. I don’t know her name, but I would be able to describe her every feature.

In my dreams, she never speaks. She just follows me around, staring at me, regardless of what’s going on in the dream. I could be having a discussion with a monk who hates the West in a monastery and she would be a few feet away, lingering and listening.

At first it freaked me out that this lady kept appearing in my dreams, but after a few weeks I got used to her. In fact, I actually started to enjoy her presence. It was nice to have some company. 

I hate to admit it, but I actually started looking forward to sleeping just so I could see her.

Anyways, I was in the city one day going about my business. I had to attend this big meeting downtown. As I was walking down the street, I caught a glimpse of a girl walking in the opposite direction with red hair who looked awfully familiar. I slowed my pace and turned around. I started following her.

All I could see was the back of her head. Her hair looked like the girl’s. It was the exact length, waviness, and color. I followed her for a few blocks, which was hard to do considering how much she turned and weaved, until she walked into a coffee shop where I got a good look at her face.

It was her. It was her blue eyes, her sparse freckles. It was her chin and her lips. Her ears and her nose. It was her, and she was even more beautiful in person.

For a few moments I just stared at her. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. She noticed me gazing at her, looked quickly and then looked away. I must have been making her nervous.

I worked up the nerve, then approached her and introduced myself.

“Hi, I’m Aaron.”

She didn’t say anything. She didn’t even look at me. I repeated myself, maybe she didn’t hear me?

“Hi…I’m Aaron.”

She looked up with watery eyes. 

“Get the fuck away from me.”

I was taken aback. What had I done? I was incredibly confused. 

“Excuse me, what?” I asked.

“Get away from me or I’ll call the police.”

I stared in disbelief for a few moments.

“Wait, but-“ 

“Please get away from me. Please stop following me. Just leave me alone.”

She started backing away slowly and seemed like she was about to call for help. 

“I’m sorry” I said.

I turned around and left the shop. What the fuck was her problem? All I did was try to talk to her. I was angry, why didn’t she just talk to me? She’s supposed to be in my life, right?

I knew I couldn’t just let her go that easily. I waited across the street until she left the shop and this time I followed her more carefully. She eventually arrived at an apartment building after about 15 minutes of walking (why doesn’t this bitch just take the subway?)
I couldn’t just follow her up to her room, and no one in there could buzz me in, so I waited outside for a light to turn on. After about a minute, I saw it. 4th floor, 3 in. I went to the side of the building and found the fire escape. I climbed up until I could hear what was going on inside the apartment.

She was sobbing, talking to someone on the phone.

“please, are you going to be home soon? I’m terrified.” 

Was it because of me?

“Yes i’m 100% sure it’s him. It’s him.” she said.

She paused for a moment, listening to the other person on the line.

Angrily, she replied “I think I would know what he fucking looks like Todd I see him every night.”

I started breathing heavy. What did she mean? Who was Todd?

After about 10 minutes, the door opened. I peered through the window and saw her running into the arms of a man. Tall, handsome, and fit. Taller than me. More handsome than me. Better body than me. Upon seeing what I assumed to be Todd, an intense rage came over me and I smashed the window open.

She screamed. 

I jumped inside, ripped the curtain rod off the wall, and when Todd came charging at me I struck him in the head. Out cold. 

She screamed more. “Please, please get away from me. Please don’t kill me please.”

 I didn’t know what to do.




Later that night, when I fell asleep, the red haired girl, who turned out to be named Melissa, was not there.
Instead, following me was a girl with dark eyes and dark hair. I was instantly in love.
