Let’s recap.  It’s been a little bit since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xyjhib/how_to_survive_college_the_old_and_the_new/).  [If you’re new here](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/), I grew up in a small town with a campground that some of you are very familiar with.  I worked there through highschool with nothing unremarkable happening until after graduation.  My boyfriend was killed, the future I thought I was doomed for vanished, and I decided to take my life in my own hands and go to college instead.

I thought about writing something insightful about how we can’t escape our pasts, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening here.  I brought my past with me in the form of ties I can’t bring myself to sever and as knowledge most people don’t have and don’t want if they know what’s good for them.  And what’s happening at my college isn’t like what I grew up with.  It’s different.  It’s like we’ve been swaddled here into this cocoon so that in four years we might emerge as something new.  And the college and the *things* contained within are also changing into something new.  A process that started before I arrived and now I’m just wandering through the ravine and marveling at how much the river has worn away and how much further it has to go before the landscape is irrevocably changed.

I wish I could say that after finishing my freshman year everything settled down, but that’s not how these things work.  I’m not naive.  When I returned home for a short break before the start of the fall semester, I already knew that when I went back to campus I’d be marked.  I had a bargain with the devil and I’d traveled into the depths of the traveling river and returned.  These things can’t be set aside so lightly.

But at least I had a brief reprieve back in my hometown.

Hah.

If only.

The town’s gossip network got to work spreading the news that I was home.  After two days, the parents of my ex-boyfriend showed up at my house.  Not Steven.  The *very* ex-boyfriend.  There’s been rumors spreading in my absence because this is a small town and of course there were.  His disappearance was suspicious enough but then I went to college, which is not something people in this town commonly do.  With no prior interest?  Against the wishes of my mother?  But no, it couldn’t be because I’m trying to get away from this stupid fucking town, it’s because I’m *guilty* of something.  Surely I *know* what happened or - gasp - might even *be involved*.

Which I guess I do know something, but what am I supposed to say?  Oh your golden child wasn’t really all that great and apparently there was a lot more going on with him than even I knew about, because Krampus saw fit to make a personal appearance and strangle him to death before dragging his corpse away to some wintery hellscape.

No one will believe me.  Or at least, his parents will never believe me, and I have no desire to be hounded and blamed by these people every time I come home to visit my mom and my siblings.

Because they’re borderline accusing me of being the reason he disappeared and all I did was try to have a future of my own and not join them in their life of misery and mourning.  We weren’t even married.  I’m realizing that I didn’t even like him as much as I thought I did.  My life isn’t over because my boyfriend died when I was 18.

Maybe the devil knew what he was doing in keeping me out of that community college that was closer to home.  I need to be an inconvenient distance from this place.

So they showed up on the front door when only myself and my youngest sister were home.  I opened the door because I felt I should.  I figured they were only there to ask how I was doing, as that would be the polite thing to do for someone that presumably was important to the deceased, right?

Oh no.  They showed up to start *drama*.

“Did you take him with you?” his mother demanded, growing increasingly hostile as I repeated over and over that I didn’t know what happened to him.  “He left his car behind.  Someone had to drive him.  Did you leave him somewhere?”

“Didn’t the sheriff tell you everything?” I sighed wearily.  This was going to go nowhere.

“But where is he?!  Is he at - at that *school*?”

“We told him he needed to take over the business,” his dad rumbled.  “That it was time he grow up and stop daydreaming.”

Oh my GAWD I hate this town sometimes.

“If he left,” I snapped, “that was his choice to make.  And he’s not at my school.  I haven’t seen him and I’m trying to move on.”

Then I shut the door in their faces.  Locked it for good measure.  I stood there, heart pounding, listening to the muted discussion taking place on the doorstep.  They finally decided to leave and talk to my mom over at the store.  Let her know what a disrespectful daughter she had.  Fine.  My mother and I might not agree on everything but we agreed on this at least.

My ex’s parents needed to mind their own damn business from here out.

I at least texted her to let her know they were coming.

Then I turned around to find my youngest sister staring at me from the end of the hallway.  She’d watched the entire confrontation.

“They suck,” I said, jabbing a thumb at the door.  She nodded solemnly.

“They’ve been bothering mom too,” she said.  “Was he bad too?”

I sucked in a breath.  My youngest sister was the quietest of my siblings and she was also the most close-mouthed.  I didn’t think she’d tell anyone anything.

“He was,” I said.

“He vanished at the campground, didn’t he?”

I asked her how she knew that and she said it was just a hunch.  I watched her carefully but she wasn’t meeting my gaze and I wasn’t certain if she was repeating what she’d heard somewhere or if this was her own idea.  Then I told her that yes, he did vanish at the campground.  And that she should stay away from there because even with an ancient being watching over it, it’s still dangerous.

You can’t leave some things behind, once they’re a part of you.

But it looks like I’m no longer going to be as welcome back home as I used to be.  It made going back to college easier, once move-in weekend rolled around.  This time my mom drove me.  She was disappointed that I hadn’t transferred to the community college closer to home, but she was making her peace with it.  Then, after she’d helped me carry my things into the dorm room (same one I had for the spring semester) she took a deep breath and looked me straight in the eyes.  We were standing by her car, parked by the curb, ignoring the harried volunteers that were trying to get people to unload and get out of there.

“You come back,” she said.  “You have to keep coming back.  I can’t handle losing someone else.”

Like she’d lost dad.  I just nodded, urgently, trying not to cry and then we hugged and she drove away.

It feels surreal to be back here.  I was only home for a week but move-in felt like my first day all over again where everything was new and unfamiliar.  And there’s all these buildings and landmarks that I know but I’ve been seeing them mostly empty all summer and now they’re filled with people and everything has changed again.

I feel incredibly lonely seeing all these people I don’t know and I’m not sure why that is.

Cassie and I have picked up right where we left off.  She’s talking about internships already.  There’s a job fair early in the fall semester for her degree program and she’s making a list of which companies she wants to interview with, ranked by how much the internship pays.  I wish I had that kind of direction.  I’m still not sure if I picked the right major.  In fact, I’m pretty sure I didn’t.  I just had to pick something, right, so I picked the one that fell in line with the classes I found interesting in my first year.

Yeah, I’m majoring in geology.  I don’t even know what you do with that kind of degree yet.  I’m telling myself it’s a placeholder until I get the rest of my life figured out.

No pressure.

I haven’t talked to Maria yet.  There’s been some messages in the Rain Chaser’s discord channel but I’ve been ignoring it.  I actually uninstalled the app from my phone, late one night when the sky was overcast and my chest felt tight and I couldn’t fall asleep.  I want to keep going, just keep walking forward and not look back.  The eye is gone.  The dead students are forgotten by everyone else.  I don’t want to look back, I don’t want to think about it, I don’t want to talk to Maria.

This is how I feel.  Realistically, I know I can’t avoid it forever.  She deserves to know that the eye is gone and the students that were killed are at rest.  Besides, I need her help to distribute my flyers.  They’re nothing fancy.  Just a sheet of paper titled “How to Survive College” and a list of the rules such as they are.  I printed them off campus and have enough to leave a stack of twenty in each dorm’s computer lab.  I just need people that can get into the labs and for that, I guess I need the Rain Chasers.

Let’s review the rules.

1. Don’t go outside when it rains.
2. If you fall asleep in class and no one is around when you wake up, stay at your desk. Pretend you’re taking notes. Don’t look up and don’t look around, no matter what you hear. You’ll be returned to your classroom when it leaves.
3. Don't leave your laundry in the washer or dryer for too long. If you do and someone has folded it for you, put it away nicely. If you don't, the person that folded it for you will know and will come for you.
4. If you break campus rules and go into the steam tunnels, be aware of your surroundings. If you see where steam is leaking into the open air, run. Get out of the tunnels as quickly as you can. There's more than just steam down there.
5. If you get caught out in the rain… you are not seeing things. There is something out there, between the raindrops. Get inside as quickly as you can.
6. Campus does not flood. If you see water beginning to accumulate any larger than a puddle, get to high ground as fast as you can. The river is coming for you.
7. If you’re in the steam tunnels and a door doesn’t open to where you expect, close it and open it again. It should lead you to the correct location on the second try.
8. If you absolutely must venture out in the rain, go in groups.  Do not be caught in the rain alone.  Similarly, never swim in the gym pool alone.  They hunt in packs and are looking for easy prey.

They don’t have everything, but those are the rules I felt most confident putting into print.  I can always put out updates.  I’ll be honest - I feel silly with these.  Kate always complained about how they didn’t work but she kept doing it, so it must have had *some* effect, right?  And maybe it’ll be different here because people are already passing what to do with the rain around by word of mouth.  I feel they take it more seriously.

But yanno?  Distributing these is a problem for another day.  For the first week I only wanted to focus on my classes and my new job (more on that in another post).

I’m taking more geology classes, obviously.  I have a class about dinosaurs and that sounds interesting, right?  It was even taught by a different professor than Mr. I-Believe-In-Stereotypes-But-Not-Monsters so it seemed like it was all going to turn out great.

Hah.

Hahahahahahhaaha.

I’m not sure how you make *dinosaurs* boring but this professor is managing to accomplish it.

It’s an early morning class.  Starts at 8AM, which is a special kind of hell in of itself.  But it gets worse.  It’s in a big lecture hall with like a hundred something students and we all file in and once we’re all seated he turns the lights off.  And turns on the projector.

And starts *droning*.

I just have so much regret right now.

Like most everyone, I suspect, I’m having trouble staying awake.  I’m doing my best.  It’s like he’s going out of his way to make it as difficult as possible, though.  Phones and laptops are banned and since the room is semi-dark, it’s easy to see who is breaking the rule.  I try to take notes but I’m kind of a shit note taker to begin with and it’s not enough to keep my brain engaged.  I’m just hoping this is one of those classes where you can read the textbook and be okay for the exams.

‘Let me guess,’ you’re saying.  ‘You fall asleep on the regular.’

Yes!

‘And when you do, something weird happens.’

Well, it was only the once so far.  But it was in the first week of the semester so that doesn’t bode well.

Something ran across my foot.  That was what woke me up.  The professor was still droning down at the front of the lecture hall.  I covertly glanced around to make sure no one had seen me startle awake, though I’m not sure they could have judged me for it, I’m sure they were all falling asleep as much as I was.  Everyone around me was quiet, watching the presentation or staring blankly at their open textbook or sleeping.

There was something odd about the floor, though.  The shadows were off, subtle, but enough to catch my eye and I took a harder look.

The ground was covered in tree roots.  They grew together in thick cords, reminding me of the tangled cables in a computer server room.  They ran down the stepped levels of the lecture hall, flowing steadily towards the middle, rarely branching, rarely veering.  Then they pooled around the podium, swirling to a thick knot right in front of the podium, and then branched out again towards the back wall and beyond.

I leaned over, pretending to look inside my backpack.  This could be another situation like the thing in the hallway and I felt it best to act natural until I understood what was happening.  But while I was bent over, I touched the tree roots.

They felt real enough.  Smooth and cold with a slight chalky texture.  I stared hard at them, trying to make out details as my eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness under the table, shielded from the glow of the unending presentation.  They were covered in lines like cracks, dark paths running perfectly parallel to each other, sometimes crossing over to form bridges between each track.  It reminded me of computer circuitry.

I was strangely calm.  There was a whole other world next to the college and sometimes it veered into ours, but there was always a way out.  That’s what I’ve been telling myself about the traveling river and the flooding library and the thing in the hallway and everything else.  There was always a way out.  I just had to be patient and wait for it to pass by.  The tide would recede and I’d be left here standing on the correct bank.

I straightened.  As I did, I glimpsed a dark shape on the underside of the desk.  A lump the size of a soccer ball.

I froze.  It did not.

It *unwound*.  A long, sinuous body uncurled, hundreds of legs clinging to the underside of the particleboard.  Its carapace shined as it caught the light of the projector and two antennas flitted in my direction, each as long as my forearm.

Look, there’s only so much a person can take and still remain calm and collected.  I apparently found my breaking point right then and there and that point is a giant ass bug monster inches from my face.

I screamed.  I threw myself away from it, falling out of my chair.  It reacted to the noise, skittering down the table leg as fast as thought.  I heard the click of its multitude of legs as it stretched out to its full length.  A yard long, at least, and as thick as an apple.

A millipede.  A giant millipede.

“NO!” I shrieked, jumping onto my chair as it came at me, mandibles clicking spasmodically.  “GET AWAY FROM ME!”

I stood on my chair, hyperventilating as its head reached the chair leg and its body curved upwards.  I cast about desperately, trying to figure out where to flee, and then my eyes fell on my textbook.

It’s very heavy.  I seized it and threw it as hard as I could at the millipede.  The book struck it squarely on its body and simply fell to the side.

The creature, however, recoiled.  It hissed and then ran from me, swerving across the ground as it traveled up and down over the roots.  It reached the wall and began to flee up it.

Then I made the mistake of looking up.

The ceiling was covered in them.  A roiling mass of chitin and flashing antenna.

I next remember someone calling my name.  The person that sits next to me, staring up anxiously, repeating my name over and over.  Slowly, I looked around.  I was still standing on my chair.  Everyone was staring at me.  I opened my mouth, trying to speak.  Everything felt like it was happening so slowly and I didn’t know what had happened in the past few seconds.  Like my brain had simply turned itself off after seeing what was on the ceiling.

“Are you okay?” my neighbor asked directly.

“Uh,” I said, “I saw a rat.”

A ripple ran through the students.  Everyone around me glanced under the table and I saw a couple of them pick their feet up off the ground and huddle on top of their chairs.  Finally, one particularly brave hero got up and made a thorough search before proclaiming the area was rat-free now.  I sat back down.  I didn’t put my legs under the desk.  I kept my feet up on the edge of the chair.  I wasn't the only one doing this so I guess they believed my excuse for panicking.

Throughout all this, the professor didn’t say anything.  He looked at me for a long, hard moment and then continued talking about the pikaia.  I sat there with my heart hammering, not really listening.  The incident had made sure I was *wide awake* but I couldn’t focus on anything anymore.

There was a touch at my elbow and I about jumped out of my skin.  At least I didn’t scream this time.  My neighbor slid me a note.  He jerked his head, indicating it came from someone else further on in the row, but no one was looking in my direction to fess up to who sent it.

I unfolded it.

‘I saw them too,’ it read.  ‘They weren’t rats.’

No one stopped to talk to me after class, even though I took my time packing my backpack to give them an opportunity.  I guess they wanted to get out of this room as fast as they could.  I kind of did too.  I’m not sure how I’m going to keep going back to that classroom, after what I saw.

My delay gave someone else the opportunity to come talk to me, though.  The professor made his way up the aisle and caught my eye.

“Everything okay?” he asked.

“Oh, yeah, I’m fine,” I said nervously.  “I’m not sure what I saw anymore.  I just thought something ran across my foot.”

“Well, feel free to move if it makes you feel better.  There’s plenty of open seats near the front.”

Like hell I’d sit near the front.  I didn’t need him to see me drooling into my hand when I fell asleep again.  If I fell asleep again, that is.  But I thanked him for his consideration and said I’d think about it.  I left hurriedly, hoping the other student that witnessed the tree roots and the millipedes would be waiting for me, but the hallway was empty.

I wonder if they were avoiding the professor eavesdropping.  I wonder if the professor knew it wasn’t a rat.  If he’s going to be watching me now.  Or maybe I’m letting my paranoia get ahead of me.

Or maybe it doesn’t matter.  I have to be careful.  I killed the eye and I have to assume that there is now a target on my back.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)
