**I work on the 19th floor.**

It’s not important what I do. It’s one of those jobs where the title sounds like it means something, but when you try to explain it, people nod too fast.

The kind of job with monitors that stay on even when you clock out. The kind of office with no clocks, but a breakroom full of energy drinks. You know the type.

Anyway. I take the elevator every morning.  
Same time. Same button. Same man.

He's always already inside.

Thin tie. Tan skin like it’s been freshly shaved. Hair neatly parted, a little too shiny. He stands perfectly still in the back right corner, both hands folded in front like he’s praying without the knees. And as soon as I step in, he says it:

“Still sure you want this?”

I say “yes” like a reflex. Not even thinking.  
He smiles — not friendly, not weird. Just fixed.  
And we ride.

19 floors. Quiet hum. The kind of silence that feels… intentional. Like the elevator’s holding its breath.  
I don’t look at him. He doesn’t move.  
When we hit 19, the door slides open and I step out.

I never hear him leave.

It started three weeks into the job.  
At first, I assumed he was some kind of exec — those ones from other branches who float in to sit on empty chairs and drink from glass mugs you’re not allowed to touch.  
But no one talks about him.  
Not once have I heard, “Oh, that guy from the elevator,” or “He’s from HR.”  
Nothing.

I asked once.  
Lauren from Data just looked confused. “Which elevator?”  
There’s only one.

I guess the thing that really gets me is: I never saw him enter.  
Never caught him walking into the building. Never passed him in the lobby.  
He’s just… already there.  
Every morning.

“Still sure you want this?”  
Yes.  
Always yes.  
What else would I say?

I had another offer, you know.  
Back when I was job hunting, I had two emails. Two PDFs. One had better hours, worse pay. One was this.  
Guess which one I opened first. Guess which one I told myself “made more sense.”  
Guess which one had a reply window that “expired” after fifteen minutes.

Still. I said yes.

Next morning, the elevator stutters halfway up.

Not violently — just a glitch. A hiccup in the climb.  
The kind of jolt that makes your stomach pause before your brain catches on.  
I glance at the panel. We’re between 6 and 7. Lights overhead flicker — like someone's playing with a dimmer switch in slow motion. Everything dulls out. The colors in my reflection go flat. I look like an old photo.

Then it smooths out. Like nothing happened.

Except the man’s smile has cracked.

Not gone. Just… wrong. Crooked at the edges. Like he forgot how to hold it.

And for the first time in weeks, I actually look at him.  
The lines under his eyes. The way his suit doesn't wrinkle. The way his shoes didn’t cast shadows.  
He turns to me — not a lot, just a slight lean, just enough to let the elevator feel smaller.

“Still sure you want this?”

Same words.  
But not the same voice.  
It sounds... tired. Not like he’s offering anymore. Like he’s asking for real.

Like I could say no.

I turn to the buttons. My thumb goes for 19. Muscle memory.  
Except—

They're gone.  
Every floor. Every number.  
Just one button now. Dead center. Lit up soft and warm.

**YES**

I stare at it.  
It pulses.  
Not blinking — breathing.

Behind me, he exhales through his nose.  
Like he already knows.

I press it. Of course I do.

The doors open.

It’s the office.  
But broken.  
The carpet's wet — not puddled, but soggy. I step out and my shoe sinks half an inch. Cold climbs my sock. It smells like mold and printer ink and something burned.  
No lights on. Just daylight bleeding in from somewhere too far away.

Every monitor is blank. Every swivel chair is turned the wrong way.

It’s my floor — the layout, the windows — but it feels like someone rebuilt it from memory.  
A dream of what my job should look like.

No one is here.

No voices. No tapping keyboards.  
Just that buzzing silence you only hear in waiting rooms and places that shouldn’t be empty.

There’s a desk up ahead. Mine, I think. Or maybe the one I had at the last place.  
Doesn’t matter.

On it: a single piece of paper.  
Crisp. White. Perfectly centered.

It’s my resume.

Same font. Same lie about "team synergy."  
Same typo I didn’t catch — *"proficient in time managment."*  
And in the bottom corner: a coffee ring. Faded brown. The exact shape of the thermos I spilled during my second interview.

I haven’t seen this paper in months.  
I never printed it. Not after that day.

I run a finger over the stain. It smudges.

**Fresh.**

Then the elevator dings again.  
Louder this time. Closer.

I turn.

He’s inside, just like before.  
Same corner. Same hands clasped.  
But he’s not smiling.

That’s the first thing I notice. His mouth is flat. Jaw tight like it’s bracing for something.  
He doesn’t nod. Doesn’t motion.  
Just waits.

The light inside looks dimmer than it should be.

I step in.

The doors close.

There are no buttons anymore. No YES, no numbers, nothing.  
Just the two of us.

We rise.

The hum is softer now. Muffled, like the walls are padded in something thick and wet. I can feel the motion, but I don’t think we’re going up.  
Not exactly.

He doesn’t move. Doesn’t speak.

Not until we hit somewhere in-between.  
And then — he turns.

Just his head.

His eyes find mine.  
There’s something behind them I don’t think was there before.

Something human.

“Still sure you want this?”

Same words.

But this time, I hesitate.

Not long. But enough to feel it.

I think about the resume. The ring. The other offer.  
The way the fake office smelled like it remembered me.

I think about how many times I’ve said yes without thinking.

How maybe this time matters more than I want it to.

I nod.  
And say it.

**“Yes.”**

He closes his eyes.

And for a second, he looks… relieved.  
Not happy. Just like someone who finally dropped a weight they’ve been carrying too long.

The elevator stops.

**Floor 19.**

Lights on.  
The real floor this time. The right one.  
People are moving. Talking. Tapping keys. I hear someone laugh at a Slack message.  
It smells like cheap coffee and fabric cubicle walls.

I step out. The carpet is dry.

Everything is normal.

**Too normal.**

I walk to my desk.  
My real desk.

Monitor glowing. Water bottle exactly where I left it.  
Post-it notes in three colors. My inbox blinking politely.

And on the keyboard:

A sticky note. Yellow.  
Sharp black ink.

**You said yes.**  
**Again.**

I sit down.  
Click into the day. Maybe nothing happened.

But I glance at the elevator.  
Just once.

And then I look back at the screen.  
The inbox loads. My hands rest on the keys.

I just hope that wasn’t the last time he asks.
