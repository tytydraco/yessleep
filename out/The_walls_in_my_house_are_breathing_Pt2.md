I’ve seen the comments. The people telling me to run, to feel for cracks in the walls, to look for a window

As if I could see anything at all.

My vision is gone, not completely, not yet, but enough that the world is a blur of shapes and shadows. The rot has taken my eyes, has spread across the whites, leaving them a sickly yellow, the veins like dark ink spilled beneath the surface. I can barely tell where the walls end, and the floor begins. The light – when there is a light – is dim and hazy, flickering like a dying bulb.

Even if I could find my way out. What would be left of me to save? My body is failing. Peeling. Softening like an overripe fruit. I think, deep down, I always knew there would be no escape.
I think I am past fear now. Past the struggling.
All that’s left is the waiting. Stay with me here? I need people to know what happened.

I need people to know about this house.

••

The house didn’t look like much when we first saw it. I don’t even know what we were expecting, honestly. It was supposed to be a fresh start. A way to escape the weight of everything else, the crushing monotony of city life. Hannah and I, both lost in our own ways, thought that maybe this old farmhouse – silently tucked away in the British countryside, would be the answer to it all. What we didn’t know is what it was hiding.

What it would do to us.
 
It was a small rambling place – once proud but now faded and weathered. The lawn was overgrown with weeds, and the old, Georgian sash windows were shut tight with dust and grime. The walls though… had a strange presence. They seemed too still, too silent. I remember feeling something the first time we walked in, a sort of pulling, like we weren’t supposed to be there. But we brushed it off. We were just tired, overworked. We needed to rest. We needed something new.

The first few days weren’t so bad. We were in a daze, still unpacking boxes, getting used to the quiet around us. It was so quiet here – too quiet sometimes – but I suppose that as a part of the appeal. The calm, the isolation. Just me and my partner.

It felt like we could breathe for the first time in years.

But then, I began to notice small things. The types of things that you don’t notice at first. The creaking of the floorboards in the middle of the night. A strange, heavy thudding from the walls when we were awake. It didn’t seem like anything important, after all, this was an old house, I told myself, it was just settling. I wish I knew what was coming.

The kitchen… was the first place to go. It started with the tiles. They were cracked, stained with black mould and mildew. The longer we stayed the more pristine they became. They began to shine, the dirt and grime disappearing as though it had a will of its own, as if the house was scrubbing itself clean. The whole moving in period was such a whirlwind we couldn’t actually remember cleaning.

But then the cupboards began to fix themselves. A shelf that had been loose one day was sturdy the next. The wooden objects in the house seemed to brighten, the air smelled – fresher…

It felt wrong, we something wasn’t right, but we didn’t leave.

The first time I noticed something really strange was in the living room. We were sitting on the couch, and I saw a ripple on the wall. Like a huge pair of lungs breathing in and out, hyperventilating. I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me, but then it happened again. It rippled.

I swear to God, it rippled.

I turned to Hannah to say something, but when I looked back at the wall, it was just a wall again – solid, normal. I laughed it off. Maybe I was tired, seeing things. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.

As I grew more uncomfortable, Hannah seemed to go the opposite direction. She’d never been one to take to the countryside – too isolated, too quiet. But now she seemed to relax. She would spend hours just sitting on the couch staring at the walls. She’d smile sometimes, a vacant and distant smile, and I would ask if she was okay.

“I’m fine!” she serenely replied

I could see the exhaustion in her eyes. The strain.
I tried not to worry. I kept telling myself that this move was for the better, we were just so stressed with it all, the change. But it didn’t feel like that. I was lying to myself; I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was creeping around us.

In the walls.

In the air.

One night, Hannah woke me up. She was standing by the window, staring out in the front garden. I could see the pale glow of a half moon casting shadows on her face., but she didn’t seem to notice. Her eyes were unfocussed, that same distant look I got from her smile nowadays. She turned to me, but she didn’t speak. Her lips were cracked and dry, and there was something in her eyes that made me want to look away.

When I asked her what was wrong, she just shook her head.

“It’s nothing” she said, her voice thin, strained.

Her skin looked translucent, so thin I could visibly see her veins and arteries in her face and neck. Her fingers looked pale in the moonlight, too thin. I could see the bone underneath. Her lips chapped and peeling. The skin on her face was beginning to sag, clinging on to her cheek bones like wet clothes on a washing line. She looked sick. But I couldn’t tell if it was stress or something else. I didn’t want to admit what I was thinking.

The house wasn’t just old – it was doing something to us.

Still, we stayed. We didn’t want to leave.
 
•• 

The days from then on began to drag on. I couldn’t really pinpoint when it exactly started. The exhaustion was subtle at first – just a dull, constant ache. My limbs felt heavy all the time, my joint grinding in their sockets with each movement, as If I had to force myself to move. My skin eventually started to burn, then peel, then blister. My mouth was so dry, and no matter how much I drank, I couldn’t get rid of this thirst. I couldn’t keep food down. And when I looked at myself in the mirror, my face was thinner.

Hollow, just like Hannah.

I felt like I hadn’t slept in days.
 
She was worse. Her body seemed to shrivel in on itself, the bones in her arms jutting out. Her hair thinned, turning brittle, falling out in clumps. I remember the first time I saw her face – really saw it – after her routine of sitting in the living room for hours, still staring at those walls. 

Her skin had started to sag, her eyes sunken in, her cheeks hollowed. She didn’t look like herself anymore – a far cry from the woman I met all those years ago at university.
She didn’t even look human anymore.

I remember she went to say something, she opened her mouth, and her bottom lip cracked open. A dark, thick liquid seeped from the lesion.

It wasn’t just that. The house was still changing too. It wasn’t just getting cleaner; it was getting better. The cracks in the walls were filling in. There was no water damage on the ceilings, The floorboards, previously warped and uneven when we moved in, were now smooth – as though time had never touched them. The house, in all its decaying, rotten glory, was becoming new. Pristine.

And we? We were rotting.

I think back to the how the first few days here felt like a dream, so much opportunity and work to be done. How I thought maybe things would get better. But the more we stayed, the worse we got. I could see that in Hannah. I could see it in me.

I tried to talk to her, but she wasn’t there – a shell of her former self. Her eyes were fixed and vacant on the wall. She gradually spent more and more time just staring, sitting on that same spot on the couch. She wasn’t talking much anymore. She wasn’t moving much either. And sometimes when I walked by, I could smell something sweet in the air – a sickly rotting sweetness that made my stomach churn. One time I saw something behind her. 

I don’t know what it was. But it moved. Something was standing behind her while she stared at the wall. A shape in the corner of the room, when I blinked – it was gone.

I thought about leaving, I thought about putting us both in the car, driving away from this place. But something kept me here. Something stopped me.

The house somehow made me stay. It made me want to stay. Every time I thought about leaving, I hesitated. Every time I open the door, the air grew thick and heavy. Like it was suffocating me.

Pulling me back in.

I couldn’t understand it. I can’t explain it. And that is what scared me more than anything else.
