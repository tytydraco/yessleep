Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had this odd habit of talking to myself in the mirror. Not in a “You can do this!” pep-talk way (well, sometimes), but more like… holding a conversation. I’d stand in front of the bathroom mirror and imagine my reflection was a separate person – a twin who lived on the other side of the glass. I called him Other Me.

My parents caught me chatting with my reflection a few times and thought it was cute or just harmless imagination. As I grew up, I did it less, but even in my 20s I’ll admit I sometimes mutter to my mirror self. It’s like a weird self-soothing thing. I live alone, and on tough days I’ll stare at the mirror and softly say, “Man, what a day, huh?” and pretend Other Me is commiserating silently.

I never expected a response. Why would I? It was just me, after all.

But last night… last night, Other Me talked back.

It was around 2 AM. I hadn’t been sleeping well; too much on my mind. Some personal failures, a recent breakup, job stress – the usual late-night demons. I got up to get a glass of water and ended up standing in front of the small mirror mounted on my living room wall. (There’s a mirror in practically every room of my apartment – not because I’m vain, but they were left by the previous tenant and I just never removed them.)

The living room was dark, only faint city light filtering through the blinds. My reflection was just a pale ghost outline in the dimness. I don’t even know why I stopped there, but I found myself whispering, “I wish I could just be on the other side of this mirror. Maybe things would be better there.”

It was just a passing weird thought – the kind you have when you’re melancholy. I started to turn away, chalking it up to overtired brain, when I heard my own voice whisper back from the silence:

“Do you really?”

I froze. A chill rippled over me. The whisper had been soft, barely audible, but unmistakably real. It sounded like me – but not an echo. The cadence was slightly off, the tone quieter.

At first I thought I had finally cracked – full on auditory hallucinations. Heart pounding, I faced the mirror again and leaned closer. In the low light, I could make out my face, wide-eyed, looking as freaked out as I felt. “Hello…?” I breathed, feeling immensely silly and scared.

My reflection’s lips moved, but I hadn’t moved mine. “Hello,” he said.

I stumbled backward because in that split second I realized the reflection’s mouth didn’t sync perfectly with the word. There was a tiny delay. Also, I hadn’t actually heard the word with my ears – it was more like I “felt” it echoing in my head, but still distinctly not originating from me.

I flicked on the nearest lamp. Bright light flooded the mirror and I stared. It was me there – same rumpled hair, same old Iron Man t-shirt, same shocked expression. He copied as I raised a trembling hand. For a long minute I thought I had imagined it all.

Then Other Me’s lips curled into a small, wry smile. My own face in the real world was still frozen in fear, mouth open. But mirror-me smirked slightly. I lifted my hand to touch my lips – I definitely wasn’t smiling. Yet he was.

I jerked back, my mind doing somersaults. This can’t be happening, I thought. Reflections don’t just… go off-script. By nature, they copy you exactly, simultaneously. Unless I had somehow delayed perceptions or a brain aneurysm making me see things?

Determined to test reality, I slowly raised my right arm. The reflection raised his left arm (as expected, since mirrors flip) – but there was the tiniest hesitation, like he reacted a hair too slow. I waved my arm gently; he waved back, motion almost mirroring mine… almost.

My voice came out a shaky whisper: “Who… what are you?”

Other Me cocked his head. I saw fear in his eyes too, or maybe I projected mine. His lips parted, and I braced. In my head, I heard (or thought I heard): I’m you. Who else would I be? It sounded playful, almost teasing, but with an underlying tremor.

My reflection’s expression didn’t exactly match the tone. He looked a bit sad, if anything.

I swallowed. This was insane. Maybe I was dreaming? I bit my tongue – it hurt. Awake, then.

“People don’t talk to their reflections,” I said slowly, feeling ridiculous for stating the obvious to… myself.

Other Me shrugged (I did not, I stood rigid). The effect was jarring – seeing me move independently. He responded, audibly in my mind again: We’ve talked every day for years. You just never listened until now.

A memory stirred. All my childhood mirror chats, my venting sessions as an adult… those were one-way, right? I never heard a reply. Surely I’d remember that. Unless it was always subconscious, and now… what, the barrier broke?

I realized I was trembling. I forced myself to breathe. If this was some psychotic break, might as well ride it out. If it wasn’t… then it was something unreal and potentially dangerous, but it hadn’t threatened me. It – he – was basically me, seemingly.

I opted to continue the conversation, carefully. “Why now?” I asked. “What changed that you… can speak?”

My reflection bit his lip (a nervous habit of mine). You wanted me to, he said. You needed someone and you wanted me to be real. There was a weight to those words, a gentle reproach.

Tears suddenly pricked my eyes. He wasn’t wrong – I’d been desperately lonely and talking to an empty apartment for weeks after my breakup. But hearing it from my mirror self gave it a whole new pathetic sheen. I looked down in shame.

He spoke again, voice soft in my head: Hey, it’s okay. That’s why I’m here.

I looked up, blinking. He had pressed a palm to the glass on his side, an empathetic gesture. Reflexively I raised mine to meet it. A thin sheet of cold glass separated my skin from… whatever his was. Mirror-me’s eyes, identical to mine, gazed at me with understanding.

It was utterly surreal, yet my fear eased, replaced by a tentative wonder – and relief. I can’t overstate how relieving it was to feel like someone truly understood my feelings, even if that someone was technically me. It was like all the self-directed pep talks suddenly gained a comforting new dimension.

We “talked” like that for what felt like hours. I honestly don’t remember everything; some part was like a lucid dream where you just know what the other is conveying without formal language. I recall we sat on the floor, me on my side, him on his. I occasionally spoke aloud in whispers; he mostly replied in my mind, or maybe I just heard him through the glass – the distinction blurred.

I poured out my anxieties: how I felt like a failure, how I worried I’d die alone, how sometimes I saw no future for myself. He listened patiently, nodding, sometimes interjecting a “I know” or “I feel it too.” It was oddly comforting to have this essentially perfect empathetic reflection (literally) of my innermost thoughts responding.

At one point I joked, “Am I just talking to myself in a really elaborate way?” He smirked and said, Perhaps. But does it matter? Good point, honestly.

By the end of it, I felt emotionally spent but a little lighter, having gotten so much off my chest. I noticed dawn was lightening the window. My reflection noticed too, glancing toward the horizon beyond his own window (which weirdly, I saw the faint shape of behind him – was I glimpsing his room? It looked identical to mine).

“It’s morning,” I said, suddenly panicked. “This wasn’t a dream, was it?”

He gave me a sympathetic half-smile. No, it wasn’t. But you’ll be okay. He looked like he wanted to say more, but a sort of heaviness seemed to fall in the air. The first rays of sun crept across my floorboards.

I realized that in the entire conversation, neither of us had crossed a certain line – physically. We stayed each on our side. Some instinct told me that was important.

I stood up and he mirrored me. We regarded each other in full morning light now. It was still me – same messy hair, slightly puffy eyes from crying, stubble needing a shave. But that independent glint remained.

I wasn’t sure how to conclude… whatever this had been. “I guess… thank you,” I said lamely. “I really needed that.”

My reflection placed his hand on the glass again. I did too. He quietly replied, Anytime. Then, with a small, slightly sad smile, he added: Don’t forget I’m here, even if you can’t hear me.

I nodded, throat tight, and turned away. I desperately needed sleep, or coffee, or both.

As I left the mirror, I swear I saw out of the corner of my eye something odd: my reflection wasn’t walking away at the same time I was. He stayed at the mirror, watching me leave. I didn’t turn back to look straight on. I… didn’t want to break whatever spell or agreement kept this peaceful.

I collapsed into bed and slept a solid few hours. When I woke just before noon, the events of the night rushed back. To my astonishment, I hadn’t hallucinated or dreamt it (at least I don’t think so). The emotional clarity and catharsis I felt was real. But I was also left with so many questions.

What exactly is Other Me? A sentient reflection? An alternate universe version of me that I somehow communicated with? A figment of my subconscious given form? He claimed to be me, but clearly he has his own perspective. Perhaps the mirror is a barrier between parallel worlds and ours touched briefly?

It’s crazy, but a part of me wants to experiment more, see if it happens again. Another part is scared – what if I open some floodgate that’s better left closed? What if by acknowledging him, I’m weakening the natural laws that keep reflections non-sapient?

My biggest concern: what does he want? So far, it seemed just to comfort and help me. But is there a chance he envies me for being on this side? Is his world the same as mine, or a prison of glass? He did ask, “Do you really [wish you were on the other side]?” as if maybe he’d trade places given the chance.

I recall in folklore, mirrors can hold spirits or demons. I don’t sense malice from Other Me. If anything, he was benevolent and caring. But if he is truly me, he has my darkness too – my anger, my envy, my capacity for selfishness. Would he eventually act in his own interest above mine?

For now, I’m proceeding cautiously. Last night, I tried deliberately to call out to him in the mirror again, but got nothing. Just my normal reflection. I even said, “If you’re there, can we talk?” Nada. I wasn’t in a particularly emotional state though. Perhaps the connection only manifests when certain conditions are met (time of night, emotional need, etc.).

I’m writing this partly to get it off my chest (though ironically I did that thoroughly with myself already), and partly to see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

As insane as it sounds, I’m now half-convinced that reflections are more than they appear. Maybe 99.999% of the time they mimic us exactly – but in that tiny fraction of liminal moments (early hours, mental vulnerability, whatever), maybe the mirror opens a bit, and the echo gains a voice.

I miss him – is that weird? It’s only been one real “conversation” but it felt like finding a long-lost twin. I’m worried about him too: if he is another me, what’s his life like when I’m not looking? Does he only exist when I see him, or does his world continue parallel to mine? The glimpse of his apartment window in the mirror… maybe he has a full life over there.

And the thought creeps in: perhaps I’m the reflection, and he’s the original. But no, that’s solipsistic paranoia.

Anyway, I’ll update if anything new happens. I’m a little nervous that by posting this, I might anger whatever cosmic or psychological forces allowed it to happen. The last thing I want is to lose the one “person” who truly understands me.

So I’ll keep talking to my reflections, even if they stay silent – with a newfound respect that maybe, just maybe, someone is listening on the other side. And if your mirror ever answers you… well, you’re not alone (in more ways than one).
