  


Today’s delve should have been a routine task. Key word being “should”. My gear is gone, my partner is gone, and I've lost most of my left arm. The acid, which is to be blamed for the sorry state of my arm, spewed out of a wall orifice when my partner and I had been running. Some of the shittiest luck in the world. I can’t feel my hand and from my shoulder to forearm is a mess of melted skin, bubbling hissing muscle tissue, and pink exposed bone. My canary is still screaming his head off. I can't tell if it's trying in vain to warn me or if it's begging for me to put it out of its misery.



“Shut up!” Is the only thing i can manage to say. With my good arm I swing and begin to rain weak blows onto his abdomen. It's a miracle I haven't gone into shock and his screaming isn't helping. This canary is a faulty product. All canaries are bred to alert delvers when pit tunnels contract or the nerves start to wake up. Must have been a shitty breeding hen.



I've been trapped in here for about an hour. I hope Phil, if he is still alive, will have to ascend and get a cutting crew, but even if they do get me out of here in time I can't go back to delving with an arm like this. Phil will have to get a new partner and I'll have to give up the ambergris business. That's if I get out. God knows that Judson town wouldn't even notice I'm gone. The bone brick and marrow mortar buildings, the whole town actually is full of people coming in and out. 



If my calmness is strange to you, within the ambergris delvers death is a close friend. I've had two partners die throughout my career. Since I was sixteen I've been looking for the grey gold. Used to delve with a few childhood friends but most of the group gave up after pretty Della Lash got caught in a cavity spasm. Cutters were quick enough to pull her broken and bruised body before it was absorbed by the cavity. Jay Prat was crying for a whole month. If I had died none of the boys would have cried. I was, and still am, a brutish girl.



“PHILLLLLLLLLLL!!!” I yell. I'm aware that the constricting and groaning muscle fibers are stopping my voice from escaping the cavity. Yet i still scream and listen for an answer. The cavity is shrinking bit by bit. The canary to my side has finally worn out his vocal chords as blood and saliva dribble from his open mouth. No sound escapes just air. An occasional squeak and cough from him is the only sound besides the creaking and popping of the cavity around us. His gauze covered face swivels from left to right. The canary and I both know we are going to die.



Phil was always the one to purchase new canaries. The Judson aviary wasn't the most humane and going there always made me sick to my stomach. The smells, the state of the hens, and the sadistic amputator. Most amputators make sure to sterilize everything and when patching, they make sure to patch the nerves and to dull bone. The pale man was a shoddy amputator and many of his birds ended up dying before delving down the pits. Like a circus bloodfish.



“C’mon Phil. Let's go to another aviary. That albino freak’s birds are cheap we both know that” I remember saying when we picked up the bleeding squeaking canary next to me. 



He looked at me with a tiredness that most delvers carried with them. 



“Listen Pat I don't want to argue right now. Look this month hasn't been good, and we can't keep on doing bird free delves. This is the only aviary on the islands and we can't pay the fee to ship one in. These birds will just have to do.”



 I tried to oppose but he quickly cut me off by putting his hand up in between us. 



“I don't want to hear it. I know you don't agree with how Del does things, even i know he is a coin pinching bastard, but these-” 

he moved his arm gesturing to the pregnant hens and cocks who were covered in their own excrement, the cocks who basically all had infected wounds from pecking and biting at each other, and the chicks that shivered in the chilled air 



“-are all there is.”



I was really heated and left the shop. Wiping tears from my eyes I stomped down the streets. To no one's surprise the Canary we received was in a poor state. His amputated limbs displayed Del’s heavy hand. I could already tell from the bird’s uncomfortableness that Del hadn't cut the nerves right. As was the regular for all breeder’s Del removed the canary’s eyes, teeth, reproductive organs. The shoulder latch ports showed a scary extent of rot. They leaked pus when i removed the plugs. Phil went out while I stayed and cared for the canary. 



He had been shivering and I didn't know what to do. His ebony dark skin breaking out into goose bumps as he twitched and convulsed. I laid my hand on his concave chest and tried to sooth him.



“It's okay baby” I whispered gently. 



I stroked his curly hair and whispered some more. Just trying to calm him down. Whatever I said was meaningless. He couldn't understand me. Any birds that could still speak like you and I had been purged centuries ago. Yet he still relaxed. The caress, I assumed, calmed him down. I cleaned out his ports and nubs with some fat mead (A judson delicacy). Phil came back missing two fingers but with a small bundle of the grey gold. Overall a decent week.



The muscles creak again and the roof of the cavity shrinks. The wounds on my arm have finally stopped smoldering and a chilling numbness has taken over the left side of my body. My canary is eerily still. No longer thrashing or screaming. Just laying there shivering in a quiet and dreadful fear. 



It won't be long now. Phil isn't coming back. The bird and I are going to be crushed and become part of the pit if everything continues this way. 



I hope I can become part of the ambergris when the pit is done.
