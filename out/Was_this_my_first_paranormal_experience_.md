Do you guys believe in ghosts? I have always been interested in the paranormal, but I have never had any encounters of my own. But the second I moved in to my current apartment, I started waking up at 3 AM every single night and always having this really creepy feeling. I would go downstairs to use the bathroom, and when I got back upstairs, I would be scared out of my mind and thought I saw shadows in the mirror. I even took down the mirror for a few nights because I couldn’t stand it hanging there, feeding into my scary delusions at night. I started being afraid of the dark, never daring to be anywhere but tucked under the covers at night. I also had so many nightmares. Really freaky nightmares. And the worst ones always took place in that room. I even had an appointment with a psychologist, believing that it was my brain who tricked me with all these nightmares and scary thoughts. After this appointment, it all gradually stopped. Whether it really was my brain who tricked me, or just the fact that spring and eventually summer came around, making nights much shorter, I don’t know. I hadn’t really thought about it. 

Until last night. 

Ive had very restful sleep lately, rarely waking up in the middle of the night anymore. But last night… even though I was in deep sleep and trying my hardest to keep sleeping, it just felt like something was trying to wake me up. You know your body will automatically wake you up to tell you that you only have 30 minutes until you need to leave if you forgot to set an alarm? Or when your cat is outside your door, wanting to come in? Your body can just feel that there is a reason you need to be awake right now. I opened my eyes, checked my phone for the time. It was almost 3 AM. I went downstairs to use the bathroom, and when I saw my sunburnt knee in the fluorescent lights, I saw that I needed some moisturiser because it looked like my skin was falling off.

So when I came back into my room, I didn’t bother to turn on the lights because I knew exactly where the moisturiser was (muscle memory) so I quickly grabbed it and applied it do the dry spots. As I was standing there, I heard 3 weak knocks. That scared the hell out of me, for many reasons. First of all, it sounded like it was coming from right outside. It was weak, but I heard it behind me, and as mentioned, I live on the second floor of my apartment, so if someone was knocking on my door, I would most likely not hear it. Maybe in the dead of night, when everything else is quiet, I would be able to hear someone knock, but, I live in an apartment building, with only 4 units, so the chance of someone making it inside of the front door at 3 AM at night an knocking is very unlikely. I got so freaking scared, and I jumped under the covers.

Then, I heard 3 more knocks. A little louder this time. And then 3 more, even louder. Even though looking out the window was tempting, I have heard way too many ghost stories like this one to dare do exactly that. I tried to find a logical explanation. 3 more knocks sound. They sounded like they were coming from right outside now. I concluded that this may just be the birds that play around on my roof sometimes. But then, I hear 3 more, very loud knocks, they’re so loud it felt like the entire wall was shaking. I lied in my bed, shivering, not knowing what to do, praying for it to be over. I just kept whispering «go away, I’m not scared of you». Then, after those 3 loud knocks, it stopped. Just, completely stopped. For about 2 minutes, until I heard 3 more knocks. Much lower this time, like whatever it was, finally decided to give up and leave. 

I still don’t know what that was, whether it really just was the birds on my roof, or whether it was something else, but I hope I never find out.
