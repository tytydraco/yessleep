In 2007, a group of Japanese scientists discovered a way of growing new teeth in adult mice by transplanting into them lab-grown “tooth germs” derived from materials extracted from other, younger mice. These new teeth were fully functional and indistinguishable from the old ones, and the results were welcomed by doctors in the field of regenerative medicine. However, as with many results of experiments performed on animals, the question was: would the same method work on humans?

Officially, no attempts to replicate the experiment on humans were made, given the ethical intricacies involved.

Unofficially, several experiments were conducted *and failed.* Further testing was suspended.

Several years ago, another group of Japanese scientists—with strong ties to the first—published the results of a similar experiment. This time, instead of extracting biological material from one specimen, growing it externally and transplanting the result into a second specimen, the scientists discovered they could promote tooth growth in a single mouse by using a drug to suppress a certain protein in that mouse. This method was cheaper, quicker and simpler, and it avoided many of the ethical issues which had prevented the earlier method from being officially tested on humans.

Consequently, the lead scientist of the Japanese group, Dr. Ochimori, partnered with an American university, received funding from both the U.S. and Japanese governments, and assembled a team to test the ability of the protein-suppressing drug to promote tooth growth in human beings.

My mentor, Dr. Khan, was chosen to co-lead the testing, and Dr. Khan chose me to help him.

In total, there were six people involved in the human trial: Dr. Ochimori, Dr. Khan, me, two Japanese scientists chosen by Dr. Ohimori, and the test subject, whom I knew only as Kenji.

Of these six people, I am the only survivor, although, as you will come to understand, the term “survivor” is itself problematic, and in a sense there no longer exist *any* survivors of the trial—not even you.

I do want to make clear here that there was no issue with consent. Kenji agreed to take part. He was a willing participant.

My first impressions of Kenji were that he was a polite and humble middle-aged man whose dental problems had caused significant problems in his life, including the breakdown of his marriage and his inability to progress professionally. He was, therefore, a relatively sad individual. However, he exhibited high intelligence and was easy to work with because he understood biology, anatomy and the foundations of what we were attempting. Hence, he was, in some sense, both the subject of the experiment and an unofficial part of the team conducting it, effectively testing upon himself. While I admit that this is unusual, and in most cases improper, no once voiced any concerns until such concerns were no longer relevant.

The trial began with a small, single dose of the protein-suppressing drug injected once per day. The effects were disappointing. While the drug did somewhat inhibit the creation of the requisite protein, this did not lead to any tooth growth, and it did not replicate the results Dr. Ochomori had achieved with mice, in which even minor protein suppression had led to minor tooth growth.

Dr. Ochimori and Dr. Khan therefore decided to increase the dosage, and—when that did not create the desired result—also the frequency. It was when Kenji started receiving four relatively high-dose drug injections per day that something finally happened.

The first new teeth formed, and they began to penetrate his gums.

But this came with a cost.

The pain which Kenji endured both during the formation and eruption phases of the dental regeneration was much more intense than any of us had anticipated. In mice, the tooth growth had been generally painless, no different than when their old teeth had grown naturally. What Kenji experienced was magnitudes more painful than what he had experienced when his adult teeth had grown in, and we could not explain why.

At this point, with Kenji screaming for hours in the observation room, Dr. Khan suggested stopping the trial.

Dr. Ochimori disagreed.

When we held a vote, all three Japanese members of the team voted to continue the trial, so that Dr. Khan and I were outnumbered 3-2. What was most interesting, however, was that Kenji himself did not want to stop the trial. Despite his pain, which to me seemed unbearable (I could not listen to his screams, let alone imagine the suffering which caused them) he maintained that he wanted to continue. Thus, we continued.

Within three days of the implementation of the more intensive drug injection schedule, all of Kenji’s missing teeth had grown in. This was, from a purely medical standpoint, utterly remarkable, but it rendered the trial a success only if you discounted Kenji’s pain.

It was not feasible, Dr. Khan argued, to report such results because one could not market a drug that caused unexplainable suffering. Dr. Ochomiro disagreed, arguing that the cause of the suffering, which he deemed a side effect, need not be understood for the results to be worthwhile. He pointed out that many drugs have side effects we know about without understanding the exact biochemical mechanisms behind them. As long as the existence of the pain is not hidden, he argued, the results are beneficial and anyone who agrees to further testing, or potentially to the resulting treatment itself, does so fully informed and of his own free will. Dr. Khan cited ethics concerns. Dr. Ochomori accused him of medical paternalism.

It was in the hours during which these oft-heated discussions took place that we missed a troubling development.

While it was true that in three days Kenji’s missing teeth had all been regenerated and were functionally indistinguishable from his old teeth, this indistinguishability was temporary. For, while regular adult teeth grow to a certain size and stop, *the regenerated teeth had not stopped growing!*

They were the same size as Kenji’s old teeth only for a brief period.

Then they outgrew them: first by a small amount but, steadily, by more and more, until they were twice—then three times—four times—five, their size.

They were more like tusks than teeth, fang-shaped columns of dental matter erupting endlessly from his profusely bleeding gums, until even closing his mouth had become, for Kenji, impossible, and the strain this placed on his jaws bordered on the extreme.

We had already cut the drug injections, of course.

Or so we thought, because we soon discovered that even when we thought we knew how much of the drug Kenji was receiving, Kenji was injecting himself secretly with significantly more.

This, more than anything else, drove Dr. Ochimori to despair—because he knew it invalidated the results of the trial.

At this point, Dr. Khan decided to forcibly confine Kenji and perform emergency surgery on him to remove the inhumanly growing teeth.

I agreed, but the two Japanese scientists did not, and they instead confined Dr. Khan and myself to one of the unused observation rooms. We pleaded with them to let us out. More importantly, to help Kenji. But they ignored us.

For hours, we sat together silently, listened to the crying, howling, growls and crunching that emanated from somewhere in the facility, each of us imagining on his own what must have been going on.

Once, through the reinforced glass window of the observation room door, I saw Kenji—if one can still refer to him as that—run past, and the impression left upon me was one of a deformed elephant, a satan, with teeth that had curved and grown into—*through*—his head: (his brain? his self? his humanity?) and exploded outwards from the interior of his skull.

And then, hours later, the doors unlocked.

We stepped out.

I am not ashamed to admit that in the wordless silence, I reached for Dr. Khan’s hand and he took it, and hand-in-hand we proceeded down the hall. My own instinct was to flee, but I knew that Dr. Khan’s was the same as it had always been, to help his patient, and he led me away from the facility doors, towards the room in which Kenji had been tested on.

We came, first, upon the body of one of the two Japanese researchers.

Dead—pierced, and torn apart—his hand still held, now grotesquely, a handgun. His eyes had been pushed into their sockets and a bloodied document folder placed upon his chest. Dr. Khan picked it up, thumbed through it and passed it to me. Inside was the identity’s true identity. He was not a Japanese scientist but a member of the Naichō, the Japanese intelligence agency. I put the folder back on his chest, and we continued forward.

The facility had been visibly damaged.

Doors were dented, some of the lights were off or flickering.

We heard then a sound, as if a deep rumbling. Dr. Khan motioned for me to stop.

We had rounded a corner and were at the beginning of a long corridor. At the other end, into a kind of gloom, *rolled* suddenly what I can describe only as an ossified, half-human ball, except that I knew it could not be made of bone—because teeth are not bones, and this ball was constructed of a spherical latticework of long, thin, white teeth, somewhere in the midst of which was Kenji’s body. It appeared to me only as a contained darkness. The teeth, I noted, seemed to originate no longer solely in his mouth, but from everywhere on his body, although given the complexity of the spiralling, winding, penetrating network of fangs, which had pierced his body innumerable times, it was impossible to state with certainty where any one tooth began, or what the resulting creature even was. Surely, Kenji the man must be dead, I thought. But this new *thing* was alive.

“Kenji,” Dr. Khan said. “I can help you.”

And the ball—started rolling…

Dr. Khan smiled warmly, but the ball, although slow at first, began to pick up speed, and soon was rushing towards us with such velocity that I leapt to the side and plastered my back against the wall. You may call it cowardice, but to me it was the instinct of self-preservation. An instinct Dr. Khan either did not share or had overcome, because I hadn’t even have the time to yell his name before Kenji-the-sphere crashed into him, impaling him on a myriad of spear-like teeth, and continuing into—and through!—the wall at the head of the corridor, one man impaled on the other, and with each sickening rotation, Dr. Khan’s body was pulverized further into human sludge.

I realized I had been holding my breath and let it out, gasped for air.

I screamed.

Then I set out after them, following, for reasons I still cannot explain, the unhindered destruction and viscous trail of flesh.

A few minutes later, I found myself having entered a dark conference room, in the corner of which sat Dr. Ochimori, slouched against the walls. He was holding a long knife with which he had just finished disemboweling himself. His spilled innards still steamed, and his eyes, although moving slowly, set their gaze firmly upon me, and in slow, slurred speech he said, “End yourself now—before—before you too become of him…”

He died with a cold, rational grimace on his face that left his small, yellowed teeth exposed, dripping with pinkish blood. *And here,* I think now, *was the last true human.*

Determined to follow the path of death to its very end, I stepped through a broken down wall into some kind of office in which Kenji-the-sphere had come to rest. A few parts of Dr. Khan were still stuck to the exterior of his dental shell, but the shell itself was now completed: solid. I could no longer see between the individual teeth to the darkness that was Kenji inside. Speaking seemed foolish, so I said nothing. I simply watched, listening to the groaning and grinding sounds that filled the room, as Kenji’s teeth, having melded together into one surface, continued to grow, to push one against each other in the absence of empty space—and then to crack: audibly first, then visibly: the first fracture appearing at the top of the sphere, before following a jagged line downwards, until the rift was completed and the shell fragments fell away, revealing a single *already expanding* unity that I could not—even in the brief moment when its entirety was before me—before it expanded forever beyond the pathetic, human scope of my visual comprehension—fail to comprehend. From a thousand textbooks! Through a thousand microscopes! I knew it. *It was life.* A cell. *A solitary cell.*

Growing fantastically.

In the blink of an eye it had absorbed the room and me and the facility and you and the solar system and the universe.

*We have all become of the cell.*

We used to ask: what is the universe? We must now ask: of what is the cell which contains the universe? In a way, nothing has changed. Your life goes on as usual. You probably didn’t even feel it. Or, if you did, your mind imagined some prosaic explanation. Perhaps it doesn’t even matter: living vs. living within a cell. But I believe that a part of us knows we are irretrievably separated from the past. Those who died before and those who die after share different fates.

Looking at the fragments of Kenji’s emptied shell, I felt awe and sadness and nostalgia. We used to look at the stars and feel terror, wondering if there was any meaning to our existence. How comforting such a non-meaningful existence now seems. Once, I was afraid that I did not have a purpose in life. I tried to find it in my relationships, my self, my work. Now, I feel revulsion at the thought that I am trapped in a biological machine whose workings I do not understand and whose purpose we cannot [escape.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)
