 I remember seeing our truck whip down the dirt road that night as if I was watching from a distance: I remember the dust kicked up by our wheels and the cows in the pasture raising their heads to us as we passed with the lethargic grace of royalty. I remember the sight of a hand pressed against the rattling glass of one of the backseat windows, and the white print of it fading to a smudge. I remember myself, so engrossed in singing along with the radio that I barely noticed and certainly didn't care that someone was smudging my windows.  

I remember pulling up to our house, which I think is a handsome little dwelling, even if the paint is chipped and there’s a layer of dust over everything.   

The first thing I remember that night as a proper first-person memory is standing outside the truck, hands on my hips, trying in vain to stretch the cramps out of my back.I remember the three of us climbing onto the porch. 

The light flickered on as we approached. It’s a motion sensor light, and it has no problem turning on when we’re here, but it rarely notices, and turns off once we’ve left.  

It hadn't been raining but when you stepped inside the house she left muddy water wherever her feet touched the floor. I didn't mention it, just held out a hand for her windbreaker.   

When I took it the pockets were weighed down with something. I didn't ask what it was.  

I'm not overly polite or non confrontational. In fact I have a reputation for straight talk. But I have learned as a mother there's some things you don't say out loud lest you embarrass your kids to death.

 For instance,there was the year that Cam started leaving increasingly... personal stories  about meeting her favorite minecraft streamer on scraps of paper all around the house (kids! it's like they think the second they put something down in the house it ceases to exist.)

I guess I was feeling motherly towards this new girl that day, because I didn't ask. Besides, it's not like I could have gotten a word in edgewise.  

Cam said , “Where did you say you were from again? Somewhere cooler than here I'll bet. Everywhere's cooler than here. And has hotter boys.”  

Dina blinked, said “Really?”  

“That's how it feels anyway. It's probably not true. It probably sounded dumb when I said it.”  

“No “Dina cooed “not dumb”  

“Okay good.” Cam said “Momma always says Im being too hard on myself except when she says I'm too easy. Basically there's no right answer with her.”  

I snorted, “Usually you are too hard on yourself. But when it comes to how much chores you think you should do around here…”  

“Mom!” Cam said, “ can we not talk about this in front of Dina? It's Dee-nah right? Or is it Die-nuh?”

How did we know her name? When did we learn it?  

“Mhm” said Dina, which wasn’t an answer. 
 
“Cool” Cam replied, giggling at nothing “Are you hungry? I don't know what you're used to eating for dinner but-  

“You're being so hospitable.” I said. I couldn't resist.   

“I'm hospitable!” Cam squealed.

“Usually when we have guests you want to hide in the room” I don’t know why I kept going. Anyone could have seen Cam liked this girl. I’ve always teased my kids in a good natured way, but this went beyond that. I cared what her friend thought of me. I cared about whether she thought I was cooler and funnier and smarter than the average mom, even if it came at Cam’s expense.  

“Hiding in my room is being hospitable.” Cam answered, “ Like the people you have over would wanna talk to me anyway. Dina doesn't mind me though? Or do you?”

Dina shook her head, a trace of a smile on her lips  

“Great “ Cam said , “Well we’re having ...I don't know what were having actually. Probably leftover something with potatoes.Does that sound good?”  

Dina tilted her head to the side as if she was listening to some far off music “...it sounds just fine”  

So we all sat down together at the kitchen table. We laid out food in clear pyrex dishes. It was indeed leftover something and there were indeed potatoes. I ate, and so did Cam. Dina was staring all around the kitchen, as if she was looking for something.   

“I need to be doing better in geometry,” Cam explained around a mouthful of potatoes, “ but I don’t like it much. It’s just frustrating to try to prove things that are super obvious. English is good except the teacher hates me. He says I talk to much-mom don’t say anything in response to that!”

I chuckled, “I wasn’t going to. I was just going to think about it.”  

Cam did perhaps the most dramatic performance of a sigh I’ve ever seen. I think she managed to involve just about every muscle in her body. In order to keep myself from laughing, I turned to Dina.  

“Can I get you anything?” I asked, “ You seem like you’re lookin’ for something  

Dina’s smile was thin, almost lipless, “No thank you”  

“All right “ I said to Cam, “Just keep workin’ Hard okay, Cam? Don’t let it frustrate you.  

“Okay mom.” She brushed me off, and leaned so far across her table that her shirt landed  in her food, “  What about you, Dina? What’s your school like?”

Dinan’s gaze flicked to the side, back to Cam, “I haven't been there in a while”  

“Come to mine then!” Cam squealed, a chimplike smile on her face, “ I bet you’ll be the most popular girl there!”

“Really?” Dina seemed taken with the thought, twirling a strand of hair around her finger.  

“Yeah” Cam sighed, dreamily.  

Dina giggled, sounding very young.  

“Its good to see you laugh.” I said, feeling the need to impress on her how compassionate I was, how kind, “ Finding you the way we did? Out alone in the side of the road? Something must have gone pretty wrong in your life, for you to end up in that position.”

Dina shrugged , “I can see why you’d think that. No no. Nothing’s wrong. I’m just tired. I've had a long day, y'know. of travel.”  

“Right” I responded too quickly, nodding , “Right Right right right.”  

“Are you done yet?” Cam had shoveled down most of her food and was now trembling in anticipation “ I’ll go get my geodes to show you okay? I bet you’d like them.”

Dina stood up from the table, starting to follow Cam, but I caught her eye.  

“Dina” I said, trying to infuse my voice with a gentle wisdom.  

Dina turned to me, eyes wide.  
I felt oddly put on the spot, but I pushed on , “Are you sure that there’s nowhere else you need to be right now? I mean, are you sure no one’s looking for you? That no one will worry if you don’t come home tonight?”  

“Those are all very different questions.” Dina pointed out.

I felt like a fool then, for not noticing, “I guess you're right.”  

“I can stay over.” she said, in a tone of absolute confidence, “ It won’t bother anyone.”  

“All right” I said, and sank back into my chair.

“You have a spare room” Dina said, too casually, “ don’t ya?”  

“What?” Cam jolted, like a startled animal, “We don't have a spare room!”  
  
“But I thought-that one…”  

She pointed up the stairs, to a small room down the hall from Cam’s, which was next to mine. I knew something important about that room, but I felt somehow it would be obnoxious to point it out.  

“Honey” I chuckled, “she means…yeah, that one!” 

Cam shot me an absolute death glare, “But that room’s not empty that’s.” she stared at the wall, searching, “ well there used to be stuff there. But it’s empty now.”   

“Oh” Dina said “ good.”  

Cam pulled her up the stairs.  

I tried not to acknowledge the wave of jealousy that was building in my chest, a bitter nostalgia for nights I spent with my friends as a teenager , giggling, chatting. Now, of course, any adults I might like to be friends with were busy being ground to paste by their own work and their own families. Those who had time, the young and vibrant and free, would never deign to spend any real time with us.   

Cam couldn’t wriggle away from me fast enough, though in many ways she was responsible for my isolation. And…and…well, and nothing. It was just Cam, and now Dina, who was new and exciting and so self-posessed. And why should Cam get to lay primary claim to her company, simply due to the arbitrary factor of age? I should march right up there and tell her to come downstairs with me, and if Cam had a problem with it…  

I imagined something that made my whole body shudder. It’s just a thought, I told myself. Not something I would actually do. But of course, people never know what they would actually do until they do it.  

I stood, and noticed then that both kids had left their dishes on the table-usually Cam is good about taking hers to the sink. I thought about calling them back down to deal with them but I wouldn’t have been able to look Cam in the eye.. I cleared the table myself, feeling sort of floaty and distant as if I were dreaming.  

I still felt that way when I headed off to the barn to take care of the cows for the night. They were restless for some reason, stomping their feet and breathing hard out of their nostrils. I did my best to get them settled, and walked back to the house, exhausted. When I opened the door, I heard that the phone was in the middle of ringing. I picked up, grumbling some about the audacity of calling so late at night.  

“Hello?” I answered, hands on my hips.  

“Oh thank goodness.” gasped the voice on the other end, “ We’ve been calling and calling but we couldn't get it to ring.”

“That’s odd” I frowned, “Who is this?  

“It’s Laurie?” she said, as if I should know who that was.   

“Huh?”  

“Laurie Hamshire?” the woman replied, indignant, “ From Helping Hands?”

“Helping Hands…” I frowned, “the daycare?” 

It hit me like a bolt of lightning, “...Jodie!”
  
“Right.” she seemed relieved, “ We closed well-a couple of hours ago now.”

“Of course.” I had never felt so humiliated in my life. I was almost sick with it, “ My god. Is she okay?”  

“Oh she’s a little stressed.”Laurie's laugh sounded forced,“ but we’ve been able to keep her occupied. Maya’s been letting her play anger birds on her phone.”  

“Thank god.” I groaned, “ I’ll be right there. Thank you for...thank you.”

“It's okay.” Laurie answered “ I’m just glad-  

The call cut out.  

This is another thing I only remember as if I wasn’t involved at all. In my memory I see myself staring , vacant as a cow at the phone for a second, but only a second. After that I bolted  for the mat by the door where I grabbed my boots, still caked in barn dirt. I half-sat  half stood against the wall, shoving my boots on my feet, squatting to lace them. The motions of my fingers as I tied the laces were urgent at first but got less urgent and less urgent still. When the boots were tied, I stood up staring down at the boots blankly as if trying to remember why I was lacing them up in the first place.I squinted, and it seemed to dawn on me. I went out the door and flicked off the porch light. I took the boots off again. Turned off the light in the hall. I stood at the stairs for a moment, hands on my hips staring around the dimly lit room. As I remember I always plead with my past self to turn back, run out the door to her daughter. It never works of course.   
She always just walks up the stairs, to sleep for the night.
