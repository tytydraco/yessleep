

The story I'm about to tell is a bit long due to the many sinister events that took place in that place, but I'll try to summarize it as much as possible.

When I was 19, my dad decided to buy an apartment that was still under construction, so we had to live in a rented house located in the Santa Bárbara neighborhood in Criciúma. The house was narrow and long, without a garage or side spaces, squeezed between two other residences.

That year, I was studying Medicine in college, had classes all day, and usually left home at six-thirty in the morning, only to return around eleven at night, exhausted and eager to go straight to bed.

The house had a living room and a dining room. After these rooms, there was a hallway where my parents' bedroom, a ventilation area, the bedroom I shared with my younger sister, a bathroom, the kitchen, my two brothers' bedroom, a laundry room, and a backyard with some trees were located. The two bedrooms in the hallway had windows that opened to the ventilation area since the house had no side spaces.

One night, I was already asleep, exhausted, when my sister woke me up, saying she heard strange noises in the kitchen and asked me to go with her to check what was going on. In the kitchen, there was a Awning window high on the wall, close to the neighbor's yard, where we sometimes saw a kitten looking into our house, likely attracted by the smell of food. 

I decided to go with her, and as we were approaching the bathroom, I had a bad feeling. I pulled my sister back, and we returned to our room. At that exact moment, we heard a very loud noise in the kitchen, as if the refrigerator had been turned over and all the water bottles inside it had broken upon hitting the floor. Instantly, I thought a burglar had entered the house after breaking the Awning window where the neighbor's kitten used to look into the kitchen.

My dad woke up from the noise and went ahead to see what had happened. My mom, my siblings, and I followed him and were surprised to see what had occurred: my mom's old aluminum pot rack, with hooks for various pots, was overturned on the floor. All the pots were also on the floor, but stacked inside each other. There were also several glasses broken in half, but on the counter. Inside the glasses were all their shards. There wasn't a single piece of glass on the counter or the floor. We were scared and didn't know what had happened. After some time cleaning up the mess, we went back to sleep.

From then on, I was scared to live in that house. However, it had the advantage of being close to my aunts' houses, my mom's older sisters. There was also the issue of returning the property before the rental contract ended, which would result in a fine. And there were only a few months left before our new apartment would be ready. For all these reasons, we continued living there.

About a month or two later, it was a Saturday afternoon, and I was in the ventilation area, tending to the numerous plants I cultivated there. That was my hobby at the time. Suddenly, I felt an extremely negative energy, a terrible fear out of nowhere, the kind that sends chills from your neck down to your feet. At that moment, I saw an old man's spirit passing through the hallway, clearly about seventy-something years old, very thin and of medium height, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and loose light blue pants, both faded and worn.

I was so terrified that I jumped through the window into my parents' bedroom and started screaming for help. Given what had recently happened in the house and all the supernatural experiences I had had, my parents came to my aid and tried to calm me down, asking for patience since we would move to the new apartment in a few months. With no alternative, I agreed to continue living there.

July came, and our family went to our summer house at Rincão Beach to enjoy the summer, as we always did. Only my dad and my older brother stayed in the house. My dad, already retired, worked in Criciúma from Monday to Friday. It was a part-time job just to keep busy, as he said, being used to working since he was eighteen. My brother was studying Civil Engineering in college and was on vacation but didn't like the hustle and bustle of the beach house. He preferred to stay quietly in Criciúma, serving as a driver for my dad, who had poor vision due to his age.

It was a Monday afternoon in a week in July. Only my dad and my older brother were in the house. Around 4:00 PM, my dad asked my brother to go to the bakery on the corner to buy some bread. At that moment, my dad went to the kitchen to make some coffee and set the table for a snack since they were alone in the house with no one to help them.

With the coffee ready and the table set, my dad started washing the dishes. A few minutes later, he heard the front door open and close. Moments later, he heard footsteps as if someone was walking from the living room to the kitchen.

Believing it was my brother returning with the bread he had gone to buy at the bakery, my dad turned to the hallway and said, "Let's have a snack, son." However, when he looked, there was no one there. At that moment, my dad got scared, remembering what had already happened in that house, and immediately went to the neighbor's house, where he was warmly welcomed by the neighbor, a friendly person, while waiting for my brother's return.

In conversation with the neighbor, my dad told him everything strange that had happened in that house in the few months we lived there. He described the spirit of the old man I had seen in the hallway, as I had already told him. 

Perplexed, the neighbor told my dad that the description matched perfectly with the previous owner of that house, who had passed away a few years ago. He added that in life, the man was excessively materialistic and very attached to that house, which he didn't want to share with his heirs.

After that event, my family returned to that house at the beginning of August only to move to another residence. From then on, we lived in peace until we moved to the new apartment. Since then, I have avoided passing by that house. Over the years, I had to pass by it two or three times, but I would bless myself and look to the other side of the street to avoid the risk of seeing that evil spirit again, which had frightened us so much.

Curious, I researched on Google today and discovered that the house is now a commercial point. It has been turned into an auto parts store. I believe that all the people who lived there after us also fled, terrified by the nefarious manifestations of that evil spirit.
