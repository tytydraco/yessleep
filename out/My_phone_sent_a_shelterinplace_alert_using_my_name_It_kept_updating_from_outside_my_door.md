My phone sent an amber alert using my name. It kept updating from outside my door.

At 2:17 a.m. my phone ripped the room open with that Amber Alert siren.
The status bar said T-Mobile LTE — 2:17 AM and the banner read:

> EMERGENCY ALERT
This is an amber alert order.
Recipient: Danny
Hide immediately. Do not answer the door.
Threat level: EXTREME.



I live in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, third-floor walk-up above the coin laundromat with the busted neon “DRY R” sign. Six units. Old red brick. I killed the lamp and slid to the floor beside my bed, feeling ridiculous and also like my heart was going to climb out through my teeth.

I checked Twitter, local news, weather—nothing. No one else had an alert. When I cleared the banner, it reappeared with the same timestamp.

2:21 a.m., another update:

> EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED
They are inside your building.
Do not leave your unit.
Maintain silence. Avoid windows.



Two seconds later, the hallway stair door at the far end clanged open. Not the soft, guilty step of a neighbor coming home late—heavy, measured footfalls. They stopped outside my door. I eased the deadbolt, slow as a prayer.

The phone buzzed again.

> EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED
They are at your door.
Do not approach the peephole.
Do not speak.



Our elevator belts squeal when someone rides at night; the sound hung in the walls like a toothache. Under the door I watched a shadow stop. The building vent rattled, the way it does when somebody presses a hand over the grille.

A different tone—text from Maya.

Maya (2:23 a.m.): you up? my phone did the alert noise but there’s nothing on it. was that you?

Me: i got one with my name. shelter in place. someone’s outside my door.

Maya: i’m calling 911. stay put.

She called; I let it ring out. Seconds later:

Maya (2:25 a.m.): 911 says no active incidents. prob spoofing? want me to come over?

New banner, right over her text:

> EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED
Do not allow Maya Rangel access.
Compromise risk: HIGH.
Remain silent.



Seeing her full name in the alert made my scalp crawl. I screenshotted; the screen flash made the shadow outside shift its weight.

I called 911 myself. “What’s your emergency?” the dispatcher asked.

I gave my address and name. “I’m receiving individualized emergency alerts. They keep updating. They say someone is at my door.”

“We do not issue targeted alerts,” she said, typing. “If someone is attempting entry, we can dispatch a unit. Do not open your—”

The siren tone bled into the call, faint and wrong, like it was playing under her voice. The line hissed and dropped.

2:31 a.m.

Maya: leaving now. 10 min. i’ll honk. won’t come up unless you text me.

> EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED
Do not open for uniformed personnel.
Impersonation observed in sector.



Three soft knocks at my door. Not urgent. Patient. A pause; then three more. The elevator belts squealed again, even though it hadn’t moved.

Another alert, faster:

> EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED
Window extraction in 3 minutes.
Do not resist.



“Extraction” made every part of me retract. My bedroom window faces the alley and a rusted fire escape. I shoved a towel against the door gap and taped a receipt over the peephole with shaky hands.

The voice that came from the hallway was so calmly familiar that I almost answered without thinking. “Hey, man. You up?”
It sounded exactly like Drew from upstairs. Drew moved out in June.

My phone camera opened on its own, flipped to selfie, then blacked out as if something passed in front of the lens from the outside. When the image came back, for one frame the bedroom door behind me was open a few inches with something tall in the gap; then it was just my face again, pale and shaking.

2:38 a.m. The belts squealed a third time and the AC kicked on hard enough to rattle the vents.

> EMERGENCY ALERT — UPDATED
Dispatch authentication failed.
Maintain darkness.
If approached: do not speak your name.



No Caller ID flashed. I didn’t touch it. On the third ring, the phone snapped to speaker by itself. The siren tone coughed and a calm voice said, “We regret the inconvenience. Please remain still.”
I slapped the phone silent. Outside the door, the same voice as before repeated—identical cadence, like somebody pressing play twice on the same clip: “Hey, man. You up?”

2:56 a.m. A double honk floated up from the street, distant through the window glass.

From directly outside my door, rushed and breathless: “It’s me. Open up.”

Maya (2:56 a.m.): parking now almost there

“It’s me. Open up.”
Maya (2:56 a.m.): parking now almost there

The phrasing and pause were exactly the same. The towel at the threshold lifted a millimeter, like breath found a seam.

2:59 a.m.

> EMERGENCY ALERT — FINAL
Time expired.
We’re sorry.



Everything went quiet. The AC stopped mid-cycle. Pressure shifted in the building; I felt it inside my ears. Somewhere above, a faucet screamed and then died.

I must have slept. When light edged the blinds it was 6:41 a.m. My phone sat at 3% even though I’d plugged it in. The alert history was empty.

I nudged the towel away with my foot. Dust filmed the strip of wood outside. In it, one footprint—bare, adult-sized. Every toe defined. The big toe was flattened, the nail thick and yellow like it had been crushed too many times.

No courtesy card from LAPD. No tape on the peephole. The receipt I stuck there was gone.

Maya (7:03 a.m.): did you sleep?? i ended up not coming. got freaked out on the 5 and turned around. felt sick. my bad.

She swore she never left her place. She sent a timestamped pic of her kitchen clock at 3:00 a.m. with her cat on the counter like proof of life. The dashboard photo she’d texted earlier wasn’t in our thread anymore. My screenshots were gone too. The chat jumped from 2:23 to 7:03 like the phone tunneled through the night.

I called the non-emergency number. “Wireless Emergency Alerts don’t target individuals,” the operator said. “Contact your carrier.” I asked if any units came to my address between 2 and 3 a.m. “No record,” she said, bored.

I cracked the door. The hall smelled like antiseptic and warm plastic. The elevator sat open on my floor as if it had been called and no one got on. The stair door was propped with a package I didn’t recognize.

I tried to wipe the footprint with a damp paper towel. The toes smeared. The heel wouldn’t lift. The wetter the wood got, the darker the print bloomed, as if the boards were drinking it.

It’s 11:12 a.m. now. The phone keeps giving me little phantom buzzes with nothing on the screen. I can hear the elevator belts squeal even when the elevator isn’t moving, like the sound got left behind.

As I typed this last part, the siren coughed once—just a second—and a banner flashed and vanished so fast I only caught the first line:

> EMERGENCY ALERT — RESUMED
Recipient: Danny
Do not answer the verification call.



One single knock followed. Not friendly. A clean, wooden gavel right at the center of the door.

The phone is ringing again—No Caller ID—and the screen keeps dimming like something is passing in front of the camera.

I’m setting the phone face-down now. If it rings, it isn’t me.
