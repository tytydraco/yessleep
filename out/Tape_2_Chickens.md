[Part 1](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/5ODKZIScto)


*A farmer approaches his chicken coop, the chicken coop itself looks like a small house, a tiny painting on the wall that looks like a rooster with a smile, two windows with bars and a metal door are all the noticable features of the chicken coop from the outside.*

*As the farmer gets closer, he notices the door popped out of it's frame and upon closer inspection, it looks like a professional boxer gave the door a few good hits.* 

Farmer: Shit!

*The farmer quickly enters the chicken coop, expecting the worst, he starts counting his chickens, with a disappointed look on his face, he takes out his phone and calls someone.*

Farmer (On the phone): Hey! I know you're busy and all, but I really need your help, something big tore down the door of the coop and even took one of my chicken as it's dinner. Can you hop over here and help me change the door, I'll pay 'ya a hefty sum of cash!

*The farmer finishes his phone call, seemingly satisfied with how it went.*

*While he waits for the replacement door, he tries to find out what took one of his chickens, he stares at the chickens walking on the sawdust bedding, he tries to find any sign of struggle, blood or flesh, unfortunately he only sees the usual, noisy chickens walking on the sawdust bedding without a care in the world.*

*20 Minutes pass.*

*The farmer's friend carrying a seemingly impregnable door joins him, they shake hands and hastily get to work.*

*Some time passes, the new door is successfully installed.*

Farmer (Hands out a wad of cash): I owe you one, bud! Take this, you earned it!

*The farmer's friend takes the wad of cash with a smile.*

Farmer's friend: Let's just hope whatever broke down your first door doesn't come back, actually it would work well for me if it came back to wreck this door too, changing a door for this much moolah is well worth it!

Farmer: Cheeky bastard! Don't get your hopes up, I think this door will hold!

*The farmer's friend wishes him farewell and leaves.*

*The farmer gives his chickens fresh food and water, then locks the new chicken coop door and leaves.*

*The farmer once again approaches the chicken coop, looks like one day has passed.*

*This time, the door looks to be in pristine condition, a big smile appears on the farmer's face as he notices the door hasn't been penetrated.*

*The farmer unlocks the door and enters the chicken coop.*

*Instinctively he takes a look at his chickens.*

*The farmer's bright smile turns into an angry
 expression.*

Farmer: Damn it! How?

*The farmer once again calls his friend.*

Farmer (On the phone): Man, you won't believe me! The door's all good, and yet one god-damned chicken is missing again! Something got away with it even though the windows have iron bars and the door looks like it's damn near bullet proof. I'll need to borrow your security camera, just for a little while, three days is more than enough, I have to see for myself what the hell's happening here!

*About 20 minutes pass.*

*The farmer's friend joins him once again, they quickly shake hands and get to work.*

*The camera is quickly set-up, it points directly to the chicken coop.*

Farmer's friend: Well, I don't know what kind of animal is killing your chickens, my guess is a bear that learned a lot from Houdini! Whatever the hell it is, the camera will catch it live and you're finally going to find out who or what your troublemaker really is!

Farmer: Yeah, I hope so. Don't worry, I'll return the cam in three days, just like I said! 

Farmer's friend: Best of luck to 'ya!

*Once again the two friends part ways, the farmer locks the door and leaves.*

*A day passes, The farmer does the usual routine, but this time, no chicken is missing.*

*The same thing happens for two more days, it seems the farmer's luck finally changed for the better.*

*The farmer's friend arrives to pick up the camera.*

Farmer's friend: So, did you find out what the mystery intruder was?

Farmer: Not at all, three whole days passed and nothing unusual happened, I even reviewed the surveillance footage, all I could see is just boring old chickens!

Farmer's friend: Weird, looks like the mystery beast went on it's merry way, I guess it got sick of eating chicken every day! 

Farmer: May it never return! 

*The two friends part ways one last time, the farmer locks the door of the chicken coop and leaves.*

*It looks like it's nighttime, the chicken coop is shown from the inside*

*The sawdust bedding rustles, the chickens all run to one corner, they look to be in distress.*

*A lanky humanoid figure with short goatlike horns, emerges from the sawdust.*

*The mysterious creature lets out a deep yawn and stretches it's long arms, just like anyone would after a good night's sleep.*

*Without even a moment of hesitation, the creature lunges at the chickens, it grabs two of them by the neck, putting them in it's tight grip.*

*The creature calmly approaches the door of the chicken coop, a quick cracking sound is heard as the creature easily snaps the necks of the two chickens.*

*The creature puts down the lifeless bodies of the chickens down for a moment, with surprising power and speed, it starts punching the door.*

*Not even 20 hits are needed and the door pops out of it's frame.* 

*The creature picks up both chickens, and slowly exits the chicken coop.* 

*TAPE ENDS.*

*The same warning appears just like last time.*

*Not willing to waste any time and risk getting heavily injured, I quickly take out the tape out of the VCR and put in the next tape.*

*Tape 3: Butcher, Begins.*
