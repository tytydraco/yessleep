I found myself walking on the road with no memory .I did't even remembered my own name. It was just me all alone in middle of nowhere at night .The night was chilling cold and surrounding was filled with fog .Throught the haze of fog I saw yellow light coming from a laltain .When I saw the face of lady holding it, I was completely mesermised by her beauty. It felt like  her beauty froze the time for me . She was most georgous woman I have ever laid my eyes on. I looked into her eyes for hours. She stood and did't even spoke a single word. Then she forwards her hands and crooked her fingers against her palm while nodding her head as if she was calling me. She turned around and started walking and I started following after her. I am not 100% sure what striked me but I started asking her questions like *''Miss who are you? Where the hell are we going, and who am I ? How I ended up here ?''.*

After few minitues of walking, she suddenly disappered into haze. I looked around and saw a river in front of me. She was sitting there on an a boat and making hand gestures calling me. I am not sure if it was her or not since half of her face was covered with opaque veil. I took a step forward then thought it won't be safe to go  on boat with a complete stranger in such remote area. She came out of boat and stood there completely silent in front of me. She gave me a pendent which was shaped as rose. It has her picture inside .

She started walking away from me and again disappeared into haze . I was standing there, still and silently thinking about her. I was still very much awstruck by her mesermising beauty when I suddenly heard noises and people shouting and coming towards me with laltain . They were looking at someone lying at ground. I came forward and saw the face of person lying on ground. The face looked very familier but I was unable to recognise who he was. I tried to asked people that what was going on but everybody was ignoring me as if I did't existed. They looked like some tribal villagers. They carried the person's body while I followed them to their village but because f crowed in village I lost it . I tried asking help from other villagers but everybody ignored me as if they can't hear me or I don't exist .

I started looking through windows of huts and tents in the village and everybody pretended as if they can't see me . I can't belive my eyes what I saw afterwards .The guy the took them them while ago was lying nacked in middle of a large circle and half of his body was covered with dark ink. Another guy came and cut the genetils of the man lying on floor. Tiny digusting looking worms that I have never seen before rolled out of his genetils . after that they amputed his both te middle fingers. While I was witnessing this horrific act I felt someone staring at me ,and when I looked around it was the same lady who disappeared in  front of river was staring at me . She made same hand gesture of calling me and it felt like she was the only one who can see me . Then she tarted running while giggling and I stated chasing her like crazy. She ran into the dark woods and I kept chasing her unlit I fet into some ditch .

After this I remember nothing and woke up in hospital bed . I tried asking nurse *that how i got here ,what all things happened with me ?* Nurse didn't told me anything . When I went to washroom I saw that my genetils were missing and notice that both of my middle fingers were amputeted .I looked in the mirror and realised that I was the guy who those villegers amputetd .

After I was discharged from the hospital I went receptionist and inquired about who admitted me in the hospital .He told me I was discovered unconcious in very bad condition by a lady in woods . She immidietly called the police and hospital . He gave me contact number and a copy of police reports and told me to collect rest of details and information from the police station .They also gave me adress of the lady who admitted me into hospital .

 I was told to collect my belonging before leaving the hospital which was basically a spolit shirt and a gold chain . The pendent on chain was shaped in rose and it had pictutre of that woman with  laltain . 

Few days later I decided to go to the adress of that woman who probably saved my life . I follwed the adress and reached an old isolated house in remote wood . I ranged the bell and an old man opened it . I inquired about woman who admitted me into hospital . He told me , there was no waman in his house and he used to live alone . I saw a picture of woman hanging on wall   and pointed out towards it and said "That's the woman with laltain I saw lat time ''.  The old man said it was his wife who died in 1990 .
