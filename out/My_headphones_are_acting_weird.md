March 1st, 2024 is the day today when this started happening I’m a high school student and something that helps me study for exams or tests. Listening to lo-fi music makes me focus enough to study but lately, something has been happening with my headphones.

It started today when I was studying but then in the middle of studying the music stopped the number 10 just got played in my headphones. Like women saying the number 10. Repeatedly, I found it weird because lo-fi music doesn't have words in it but I just shrugged it off and decided to take my headphones off thinking it could just be a glitch or something. 

Oh shit, I’m coughing right now I should probably get some water and then get back to studying.

March 2nd, 2024 I decided to use my headphones again but then I heard the number 9 this time like yesterday that same toned woman. “Huh? Maybe I just need to get a new pair of headphones these are getting old anyway” I put the headphones back down oh and I'm still coughing maybe I'm getting sick.

March 3rd, 2024 I convinced my mom to get me new headphones and to buy me some medicine since the coughing was becoming more frequent 
I put my new headphones on and just started to listen to music not lo-fi but music with words. And now I hear the number 8 which is odd because these are new headphones and the song I was listening to didn't have any numbers in it “What’s going on?” Fuck my coughs are getting worse.

March 4th, 2024 now the headphones are saying 7 and now sneezing and my throat hurts my mom thinks it’s better if I stay home from school for a few days.

March 5th, 2024 they are saying 6 I realized it's a countdown but I don't know why not only that but I'm getting a huge pounding headache.

March 6th, 2024 the number 5 is repeating now and my nose starts bleeding sometimes I have no idea what the hell is happening to me.

March 7th, 2024 now the number 4 is all that I can hear I tried turning the headphones off but they won't and now my nose bleeds are getting more frequent bloody tissues are everywhere I should see the doctor soon.

March 8th, 2024 just the number 3 and me coughing up blood I’m on my way to the hospital.

March 9th, 2024 the doctors couldn't tell what was wrong with me so they kept me there but yet I can still hear the number 2 I feel dizzy now and I feel like I'm gonna pass out any minute.

March 10th, 2024 “1 more day left on earth” is what I heard the doctors say then I realized the countdown was counting down how many days until I died.

March 11th, 2024 my son died yesterday and he doesn't know that I'm the reason why he's dead. I poisoned the medicine and messed with his headphones finally he was gone. He would get so obsessed with studying the bodies I had in the basement and listening to that stupid lo-fi music.
