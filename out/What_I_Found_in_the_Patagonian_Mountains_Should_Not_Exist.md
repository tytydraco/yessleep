**If you believe demons are just superstition, I beg you to read carefully. What happened to me in Argentina destroyed every certainty I once had about faith, science, and the very fabric of reality. I went there with orders from the Church, confident that I was investigating nothing more than fear, folklore, or madness. Instead, I found proof (undeniable, horrifying proof) that evil is not an idea but a force, alive and relentless. And once you have seen it, there is no turning back**

**It began with an extraordinary visit on an otherwise ordinary Sunday afternoon, just after mass. The bishop himself came, carrying direct orders from Rome, urging me to embark on a journey south towards the farthest reaches of the continent, to the state of Río Negro in Argentina.**

**My task was to investigate a series of strange occurrences that had unsettled the region, and to report my findings to my superiors. This was not the first time I had been entrusted with such a mission.**

**During my years of priestly formation, I had always taken particular delight in the academic side of theology and demonology. The Church had granted me access to obscure volumes, hidden away in ancient vaults where natural light was but a distant echo. I devoured those pages eagerly, studying every description of the manifold ways evil could manifest in the world. The abyss of my curiosity was filled by knowledge reserved only for select eyes. In exchange, I was asked to conduct investigations for the Church, without neglecting my regular ecclesiastical duties.**

**I believed in God as the Creator of the universe, yet I had always thought of the Devil and demonic manifestations merely as metaphors for human wickedness and the corruption of the spirit.**

**My philosophical stance unsettled many within the Church, who held firmly to the reality of the earthly war between good and evil—God and His angels against the Devil and his infernal legions. Yet my eccentricity was tolerated, for the study of the “enemy” was considered indispensable, and few were willing to undertake it.**

**The preliminary report from the local priest mentioned a sharp increase in violent crimes in the city of Bariloche. What was strange was not merely the frequency of the crimes, but the sheer brutality of them.**

**Fathers drowning their infant children without any apparent reason. Lifelong friends tearing each other to pieces with their bare fists. Schoolboys abducting younger children and abandoning them in the frozen Patagonian mountains, left to the merciless winter night.**

**And then, there were the signs.**

**The local priest’s request was even more unusual. Strange symbols had appeared throughout the city in the months leading up to the crimes. Local authorities assumed them to be a juvenile prank and paid them little attention. But when monuments and government buildings were found covered with the signs, they decided to intervene.**

**They repainted all the walls, houses, and businesses that had been vandalized, issued warnings to the group believed responsible, and considered the matter closed.**

**The very next morning, the signs had returned, as if awakened from slumber. They appeared atop the fresh paint, in a yellow more hypnotic than before, as though their potency had been amplified by the city’s futile attempt.**

**No witnesses had seen anyone repaint them.**

**The photos accompanying the report left no doubt: these were no ordinary signs. They consisted of two circular shapes surrounded by finely drawn Latin letters, and in the center, abstract figures that sometimes appeared geometric.**

**There was intention in every stroke, and a skilled hand behind it.**

**It took some time to trace their origin. I knew I had seen them before, though I could not place where. With the help of Matthew, my protegé and deacon of the parish, we deduced that it was a demonic sigil.**

**The circles surrounding the figures served as protection for the summoner during the ritual, while the letters and drawings were symbols designed to invoke a specific demon.**

**“*****Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis.*** **Someone is attempting to channel evil. A grimoire of descent into the inferno.” I whispered, as my rationality trembled.**

**It was the sigil of Beleth, considered by medieval scribes to be a demon of great power, one of the kings of Hell. Twisted stories followed this malevolent entity through the ages. It was said that with its persuasive power, it could turn the most devout man into the cruelest of tyrants, and that it could grant forbidden knowledge to those who invoked it, but only after they had sacrificed their humanity.**

**Despite my skepticism, if there was even a remote chance of finding objective evidence of a demonic presence in the city, it was better to be prepared. I asked Matthew to come with me. His youth and fervent faith could provide a fresh perspective on the investigation.**

**It was winter, and a sky heavy with reddish clouds welcomed us to Bariloche.**

**The icy wind swept down from the majestic snow-covered peaks, biting our exposed faces with its harsh caress.**

**I had always enjoyed the stillness of the cold, its relentless calm. Snow had piled on the sidewalks and rooftops, covering every human construction, and I found myself reflecting on untouched lands, on fresh beginnings.**

**“Nature, unaltered, perfect in its design, sublime beyond the grasp of reflection”**

**It was a Saturday, and the streets were empty. The city lights were weak, barely illuminating the dantean shadows of trees swaying in the gusting wind.**

**Father Luis, the local priest, guided us through some of the sites of recent crimes. He was a large, aged man, his forty years of service to the Holy Church evident in his solemn bearing. He seemed unwashed and sleep-deprived, worn by endless duties.**

**“The yellow sigil is present in every case,” he said anxiously. “Even in the depths of the mountains, where the children had been abandoned, signs were carved into trees and etched onto great stones by the stream's edge.”**

**“I read the report you sent,” I said calmly. “Do the authorities have any suspects?”**

**“No. Nobody has seen anything, nobody knows anything. There is no evidence of who paints the symbols, nor why they reappear when walls are repainted. People are terrified. They come to me seeking answers I cannot give. They want someone to blame, and they will find someone, even if it is not the true culprit.”**

**“Do you have anyone in mind?” Matthew asked with a broken Spanish accent.**

**“Yes. There is a man living near Lake Steffen, on the outskirts of the city,” he said and his face flushed with fear and shame.**  
**“The shame of the informer. His faith is shaken by the inexplicable.”**

**“His name is Lisandro. People say he is an artist. He has lived here for twenty years, a hermit who comes to the city only once or twice a year for provisions. Ever since the sigils began appearing, he has been seen wandering at night, observing, taking notes, sketching, talking to himself. Once he was treated with cordiality, but now people fear him. They believe he is somehow connected to what is happening—or that he is hiding something.”**

**The police had questioned him, but found no evidence linking him to the symbols or the acts of violence.**

**Despite Father Luis’s warnings about Lisandro’s presumed hostility, it was clear I had to attempt a conversation. Night approached, and we decided to wait until morning to reach the lake.**

**The city was silent. Not a single car passed along the streets. From my hotel window, I could see the central square and the surrounding avenues, all melting into a sea of white. The only things that shone were the sigils of Beleth, perfectly traced in hypnotic yellow. Their aesthetic power was mesmerizing, awakening my curiosity and opening the abyss of my imagination.**

**What if it were all true? Perhaps the old priests had been right. Perhaps evil walks among us.**

**I shivered...**

**I woke seated in a chair, staring out the cold window. I did not remember falling asleep.**

**No dreams. No nightmares. Only darkness.**

**It was early morning. The sun had not risen and would not for hours—late winter dawns, early nights.**

**I left my room and knocked on Matthew’s door. No answer. I decided to leave him to rest while I went down to the lobby for coffee.**

**Father Luis had warned that no car could reach the hermit’s dwelling. We would have to leave the vehicle by the roadside and hike several miles through the forest. He had made the trek once, in his younger days, attempting his Christian mission, and had been met with cordial indifference.**

**“Be careful tomorrow,” he had said. “There is something in those woods. Strange decorations on the trees. I remember feeling watched all the way to the lake.”**

**When I was finishing breakfast, Matthew appeared in the dining room. He looked unsettled and poured coffee with a trembling hand.**

**“I saw him last night,” he said. “There, in the darkness. Scribbling, whispering. There was something unnatural in the way his body moved, as if a terrible force drove him uncontrollably from within.”**

**“You mean the artist?”**

**“He saw me watching. He fixed his eyes on me, and I felt my soul being examined. Malice in his gaze, a darkness blacker than any earthly abyss. I do not believe his art is intended for museum exhibitions, Father.”**

**After a forty-minute drive along the mountain road, we reached the trailhead that would lead to the hermit’s dwelling. Despite staying alert, we saw no sign of the yellow sigil.**

**The sign marking the trail was completely rusted; half the letters of the lake’s name were missing:**

**LAGO STEF N**  
**CAMI RURL**

**A grim welcome.**

**The trail was narrow, barely wide enough to see more than a few feet ahead through the dense vegetation and the lack of daylight We switched on our flashlights, pushing aside branches with our hands, but there were no footprints to guide us. In some parts, the forest grew so thick that we had to use machetes to continue.**

**It was clear that no human had traversed this path in years. The peculiar artist must have known an alternate route to the city.**

**Strange anthropomorphic shadows appeared beyond the tree lines. I wanted to believe it was pareidolia. My fearful mind creating images from the interplay of flashlight beams and the enormous branches around us but I could not be certain.**

**The silence was absolute, broken only by the sound of our own steps. No birds sang in this forest.**

**After a couple of hours, the sun began to rise, casting a weak light over the trail. Our flashlights were no longer necessary, and the path widened enough to walk without hacking our way through.**

**We arrived at a clearing surrounded by leafless myrtle trees and decided to rest for a few minutes before continuing.**

**“Look there,” Matthew said in a trembling, hushed voice.**

**Carved into the tree trunks were subtle Latin inscriptions, neatly etched in yellowish pigment:**

***Venit. Accipit. Dat.***  
***He comes. He takes. He gives.***

**I felt a pressure on my chest, and my mind began to whirl. At the base of one tree, almost at its roots, I noticed a semicircular line extending into the soil. Desperately, I began to dig with my bare hands.**

**It was the sigil of Beleth.**

**A dark thought surged through me. I ran back along the path we had just walked and began digging at the base of the nearest tree with frantic speed.**

**It was there as well.**

**Matthew joined the effort, and at each tree we found the terrible sigil carved into the earth.**

**Because of our struggle with overgrown foliage, combined with dim light and the narrowness of the trail, we had failed to notice the presence of the seals.**

**We had been careless. And now we were too deep.**

**“Father, we should return to the city. Let’s call the Cardinal with the information we’ve gathered and await his guidance and the Church’s word,” Matthew said.**

**His face was somber. He tried to remain calm, but I could see his hands trembling uncontrollably.**

**“I cannot turn back now. The Church has given me a task, and I must fulfill it. I am afraid, yes, but if we are truly facing a display of demonic forces beyond our comprehension, I must speak with the artist. I won't blame you if you return to the city.”**

**At the time, I thought my decision was determined by duty to the Church. Now I know it was driven by something darker and more primal, human curiosity, corrupted and malevolent. But now I know it was due to something more twisted and primordial, the malignant human curiosity.**

**If there was even the slightest chance that the sigils carved by the hermit corresponded to objective evidence of demonic evil among us, all questions and horizons of investigation would open. The world would take on a new color darker and more terrible perhaps but it was a risk I was willing to take in pursuit of truth.**

**The young deacon decided he could not leave me alone in the face of the unknown, but he repeatedly emphasized the danger of our situation.**

**We continued along the path, now completely flanked by leafless trees. The carvings became increasingly elaborate and lifelike: demonic visages with exquisitely sculpted wings, sinister eyes painted red that I dared not meet for long, and symbols fashioned from rare fabrics and narcotic colors, pulled straight from ancient tomes I had thought accessible only in the Vatican vaults.**

**I thanked God it was daytime. Just imagining the effect such horrors might produce at night sent shivers down my spine.**

**Matthew was completely absorbed, silent before the macabre scene, but I thought I saw his lips moving, reciting a phrase I could not discern.**

**The trail grew steeper and more demanding. At times, when resting, we could glimpse the city in the distance, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, seemingly untouched by its citizens’ suffering.**

**The climate was strange here. It seemed that the laws of nature had inverted. Despite the snow and wind, we felt heat, so much so that we had shed our coats. The intensity of the temperature appeared to increase as we approached what seemed to be the beginning of a high plateau.**

**The sculptures were different now. It is impossible to put into words the grotesque emotions they inspired in me. The color schemes were unknown to any earthly eye, and the monstrous beings represented resembled no known, nor even imaginable, terrestrial creature. They left an indelible mark, still haunting my consciousness and freezing me in moments of reflection.**

**Matthew touched one with hesitant fingers.**

**“The paint is still fresh.”**

**We could not be far from the artist, and the thought terrified and thrilled me in equal measure.**

**We hastened our steps and reached the top of the trail. The vegetation disappeared entirely, as though the earth itself had been poisoned. Not even grass grew in this clearing.**

**In the distance, we could see a small wooden cabin, utterly desolate. It had no visible doors or windows and perched at the edge of a sheer precipice.**

**We approached cautiously, straining our ears for any sound.**

**As we neared the cabin, we began to hear a constant, almost mechanical rhythm, a hammering or beating at unimaginable speed.**

**I crept to the edge of the cabin and looked down. A staggering drop separated us from Lake Steffen. Though we had been ascending for some time, no record existed of a hill that tall.**

**The sound abruptly stopped.**

**“At last you have arrived,” said a voice. “Kindly turn around the cabin and come in. We have matters to discuss.”**

**I could have sworn on the holiest of things that there had been no door a moment ago. But when I turned, a solid black oak door had appeared, inscribed in hypnotic yellow letters:**

**QUI FIDĒLIBUS EXSPECTAT**

**I whispered to Matthew to stay behind me and let me handle the interview.**

**I pushed the door, and we entered the cabin.**

**The artisan was at work on one of his sculptures a blasphemous demonic figure that seemed made of wax more than wood. I could see only the back: enormous black wings emerging from a perfectly delineated anthropomorphic back, covered in grotesque pustules. I could not bear to look further.**

**“Hello, sir. My name is Father Robert, and this is my colleage Deacon Matthew. We wanted to ask you a few questions.”**

**The hermit regarded me for several seconds without speaking. Then he turned his coal-black eyes to Matthew and smiled broadly.**

**“After so much time and so much waiting, the cycle repeats itself. I can not express the feeling of enjoyment I get from seeing two such exalted beings like you standing before me.”**

**“Sir, I don’t quite understand what you mean,” I said. “We came because Father Luis mentioned that people have seen you wandering the streets at night, observing the sigils, taking notes, and speaking to yourself.”**

**The hermit’s smile deepened, twisting unnaturally. His eyes glimmered with a darkness that seemed to devour the very light in the room.**

**“Wandering? No, Father… I do not wander. I am… the medium. The conduit. What you see is merely a surface. The work beneath is eternal.”**

**Matthew took a step back, his hands trembling. “The surface?” he asked.**

**“Yes,” the hermit replied, his voice suddenly sharp, almost metallic. “The surface conceals the abyss. And tonight, the abyss awakens.”**

**Behind the hermit, the sculpture quivered, as though breathing. Its black wings flexed, casting monstrous shadows across the cabin walls.**

**The air grew heavier, dense, suffocating. I could feel a presence pressing in from every corner of the room, a malign intelligence both ancient and patient.**

**Beleth had awakened.**

**The hermit’s eyes never left Matthew. His grin stretched impossibly wide, like a shadow of human joy warped into something infernal.**

**“After so long the cycle comes full circle,” he whispered. “You did not come to question me… you came to witness the awakening.”**

**I felt the room grow darker, though the sun shone weakly through a narrow crack in the cabin wall. The sculpture behind him trembled and shifted. Its wings spread wide, black as a void, blotting out light and reason alike. Its red eyes opened, molten and bottomless, and I understood with bone-chilling clarity: this was no mere artwork.**

**“Do you see now, Father Robert? Do you see what lies beneath the surface of faith, the hidden truths your books dare not name?”**

**Matthew froze, terrified, unable to speak. The hairs on his arms and neck stood on end. The air seemed to warp around us, reality bending and quivering as if the world itself feared Beleth’s presence.**

**Beleth’s wings shifted, producing a sound like a storm tearing across the mountains. The floor trembled beneath our feet, dust falling from the ceiling. Shadows lengthened and warped, merging with the glowing yellow sigils that connected the cabin floor like veins of fire.**

**Suddenly, Matthew stepped forward, compelled by something beyond reason. The hermit’s grin widened, and in a blink, Matthew was gone drawn into the sculpture, disappearing into the yawning maw of shadows with Beleth.**

**I tried to reach him, to stop the impossible, but the cabin seemed to expand, swallow, and twist reality itself. All I could do was stumble backward, heartsick and powerless.**

**When I finally opened my eyes, the cabin was empty. The sculpture was still, lifeless or perhaps... merely patient. The hermit had vanished, leaving only the echo of a smile and a whisper of incomprehensible knowledge.**

**Alone, I walked back into the cold, silent forest. The sigils in the trees glowed faintly in the distance, reminders that the forces we had glimpsed were still at work, hidden yet present.**

**This was no metaphor. Evil walks with us and is a force beyond human understanding.**

**The path ahead was no longer a road but a descent.Each step sinking deeper into a truth that stripped away the illusion of order.**

**What I carried was not knowledge, but a poison: corrosive, relentless, reshaping every certainty I had into dust.**

**It was not meant for men to see such things, yet once seen, they could never be unseen.**

**Evil was not a force to be fought, nor a shadow to be banished. It was a mirror, reflecting the secret marrow of creation. A chaos woven into flesh, despair inscribed in every soul. To confront it was to confront ourselves, and to realize that faith, reason, even love, are nothing but fragile veils trembling over an endless void. And in that void, I understood: survival was not a blessing, but a sentence.**

**And I knew, with a weight heavier than any fear, that my work had only just begun.**
