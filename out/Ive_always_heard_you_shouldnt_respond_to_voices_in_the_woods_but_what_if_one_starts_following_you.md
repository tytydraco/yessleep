I had always hated it when people called the Appalachian Mountains "scary." I often told myself, *How could people look at one of the most beautiful places on Earth and think of it as creepy?*

I went hiking a lot back then, and I never had a clear purpose when I hit those trails. I would just wander… It was so peaceful.

Now, I’ll never get that same feeling again.

I’ve lived in the Appalachian region for some years now, and I often go on about how much I enjoy the woods and mountains, but I can’t say I grew up here. I lived in the city most of my childhood, but that isn’t important. From a young age, I knew the mountains were where I belonged. When I was old enough and had saved up a bit of money, I moved out and didn’t look back.

My grandparents have lived in eastern Tennessee all their lives. I didn’t know much about them, as they only ever visited on holidays or special occasions. I asked if I could stay with them until I got my bearings here. They said yes. That was ten years ago now. Funny how quickly time can run from you.

I could say more, but my life story isn’t what I want to tell you.

The incident in question happened a few summers ago, just an ordinary day. I had a day off from work and decided to go out and enjoy the free time I had. As I said before, I often went on hikes, and today wasn't much different. I had a little spot I frequented, a decently sized trail that followed a small creek. It was a beautiful place, especially in the summertime.

I pulled onto the side of the road where the trail was located and got out of my shoddy little car. I walked around to the back and fumbled with the trunk’s lever a few times before I could finally get it open. I lifted the trunk and grabbed my hiking bag. It’s relatively small compared to most, but I don’t like a lot of baggage when I hike.

I closed the trunk with a thunk and set off on the trail. It was a little later in the day than I would’ve liked it to be, but it was nothing I couldn’t handle.

But it wasn’t the dark that made me fear this place as much as everyone else.

I’d walked this trail a few times before, but it felt different each time. It’s honestly one of the reasons I liked this spot so much. Different… every time. The trail starts mellow at first when it follows the creek, but then gradually gets steeper as you ascend the mountain.

The scenery and nature truly were beautiful. The singing of the birds, the soft flowing of water as I walked by the creek, it was all amazing to me.

Then… I heard something.

At first, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. But then I heard it again, a little louder this time. Was it a voice? Or maybe some new bird that had migrated here?

Either way, I tried not to pay attention to it. It was just another sound of nature, after all.

I continued walking, the sound of crunching leaves echoing with each step I took. But as soon as my foot hit the ground again, all the birds stopped singing.

I looked around, confused as to what was going on. It was almost silent now. Singing birds usually make up the bulk of the noise in the woods, but now… they were gone.

I took a deep breath. Maybe I had done something to scare them away?

Surely not. It was too sudden.

I took a few more steps, the crunch of leaves under my boots sounding louder now. There’s probably just a hawk nearby or something…

*There it was again.*

That sound.

I closed my eyes and listened, *really listened*, trying to make it out.

What I heard shook me to my core.

It was a voice.  
And it was coming from *directly behind me.*

My heart dropped to the bottom of my stomach, and I fought the urge to turn around. Every second felt like an hour.

That voice…

It didn’t sound right. It didn’t sound right at all.

It was just so *wrong* in every possible way.

It *sounded* like a person… but it *wasn’t*. Like a creature trying, and failing, to mimic a person.

It had said my name. The thing behind me knew my name.

I was frozen, just standing still. My heart was racing, and I could feel every beat like a drum in my chest.

I probably should have run, but I didn’t.  
  
I couldn’t.

I felt its presence behind me. I could hear it… *breathing.*

Then I snapped back to reality.

I started to run as fast as I could. Adrenaline pumped through me in waves, and everything began to blur into the background. All I cared about was getting away.

I kept running, tree branches and brush whipping past me. Before I knew it, I had arrived back at my car. I don’t know how I got there, I don’t even remember turning around, but I didn’t care.

I forced open the door and started the car. I slammed on the accelerator and drove away from there as fast as I could.

I looked up at the rearview mirror as I drove away.  
  
And I saw it.

I can’t… I can’t describe it.

I think part of me still refuses to believe it was ever real.

I can’t go into the woods anymore. I can’t even think of the woods without seeing that **thing**.
