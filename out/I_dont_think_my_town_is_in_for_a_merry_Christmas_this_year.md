My friend Ciara and I decided to go and look at Christmas lights a few days ago, and nothing has been the same since.

I’ve had some form of agoraphobia for as long as I can remember, but it’s been exacerbated by three years of working from home and being able to order groceries and everything else I could ever need online. I rarely leave the house unless I have to, which isn’t often.

I’d had a particularly long stretch of avoiding the outside world recently, and Ciara had been trying to get me to come out with her for months. We both love Christmas so she finally convinced me to come with her to the square around the river walk where they were having a light show and the little shops would all be decorated.

It’ll be fun, she said. No one will die, she said. (Well, she didn’t actually say that last part but at the time I would have thought that was a given.)

She was right in a way, because *initially*, it was fun.

It was the first day this year where the snow had begun to stick to the ground, but it wasn’t yet cold enough for the river to freeze over. The more we walked around, the less I began to regret coming out. It was so festive, and the lights were beautiful bursts of red, green, and white that were synchronized to the music. Almost the entire town was there.  I saw a lot of my neighbors for the first time in months, but since we were outside I didn’t feel as overwhelmed by all the people.

There were couples, kids running around weaving in and out of the lit-up trees, and there was a long line of people outside a tent filled with a happy scene and bright decorations. I at first thought it was for pictures with Santa but there was no Santa or kids in sight – I guess for selfies or something? (Like I said, I don’t get out much.) The back of the tent was clear to let in the warm glow of the lights around the square, so we could see the cheery interior filled with people. I thought it was actually a nice change from sitting alone in my house. Or at least I thought that for a fleeting moment.

Because not long after I had mostly calmed down, the atmosphere changed.

With no warning, everything around me was different. Something was wrong with the air. It felt… thick… and I found myself gasping desperately just to fill my lungs. Every time I breathed in, it burned slightly. It was much colder, too. Even my heavy jacket and pants that had been almost too warm for the weather moments ago, did little to keep out the chill.

Looking around, it seemed as if the world was slightly less saturated than it had been before.

The previously cheery Christmas lights that were wrapped around the trees and across buildings had changed, they had a purple-black hue with a colorless and hazy ring around them. It almost looked like instead of providing light, they were consuming it. The more I stared up at them, the more I felt a throbbing pain behind my eyes.

The strings of lights in the square were still synchronized to what was coming out of the loudspeakers, but what was playing was no longer identifiable as music  – there was nothing coherent about it, the ‘lyrics’, which, if those were even words, sounded like a metal scraping across glass. Like the lights, focusing on what I was hearing made me feel dizzy and disoriented.

I turned to Ciara but she didn’t even seem to notice that anything was different – she just continued her side of the conversation we had been having.

I looked back at the little tent where just moments ago we’d seen people filing in to take pictures , now it was unlit, and no one was inside. The large chair that had been set up was toppled over on its side and what had been decorative gifts were reminiscent of rotted fruit as they lay bloated and leaked a thick fluid onto the ground. The sled, which had been brightly colored and lit up moments ago looked like it had aged a century – even in the dim light I could see it had been broken, could see the peeling paint.

It did take me a moment to realize that I was wrong, that there *was* actually something moving inside the dark tent – I couldn’t make out many details, but the way it moved in the dark purple-black lack of light unnerved me. The biting wind made a howling sound as it entered through slash marks in the thick plastic that hadn’t been there before, which certainly didn't help calm me down. Patrons were still lined up outside, smiling and seemingly unaware of the changes as they continued to enter.

No one that entered was visible once they stepped inside the tent, and none had come back out. Those in line and standing nearby didn’t even seem to notice – or if they did, they seemed thoroughly unconcerned.

The sound of water moving behind me made was what made me turn back to the river.

In the middle, something dark was poking out just slightly, ripples forming around it. It started moving, slowly rising up from the water into the air, as if pulled upward by some unseen forces.

As I stared, it continued to slowly emerge from the water. I squinted at it, trying to figure out what exactly I was witnessing – it took a moment before I realized that the object was a boot.

A shadow-like form – a person – was rising out of the water upside down, feet first.

That’s when I noticed that there were more and more of those shapes rising up, barely distinguishable in the scarce light. But, once I focused on them I could see many dark silhouettes of men and women arising from the water around us.

I realized something once the body was out to the mid-calves – the boots, they looked like a shadowy version of the pair that Ciara had on, with the little pom-poms and everything.

No one else appeared to see what was happening – they were still walking around, and conversations continued all around me as if nothing was wrong.

When all of the legs and part of the waist had emerged, I stopped Ciara mid-sentence. I didn’t blame her for looking at me like I was losing my mind – I probably didn’t make much sense as I babbled about lights, the tent, and upside-down people in the water.

I noticed a new set of feet and legs emerging near the first pair, this time the shoes looked like my own, I could make out the outline of the bulky pants I was wearing.

Ciara’s sinister doppelganger was almost all the way out by that point – everything from the chin down had arisen – floating upwards, arms hanging unnaturally.

The more that the figures emerged, I realized I could barely hear the sound coming from the loudspeakers anymore – instead a buzzing sound had filled my ears and my head, it nearly drowned out any coherent thoughts I was trying to form. Somehow I knew that if these figures came all the way out of the water, something terrible would happen.

I looked around me and that’s when it clicked – the other figures I had seen – there was one arising from the water for each person that was near the river.

I tugged at Ciara’s jacket, trying to pull her in the opposite direction – at that point the figure resembling her was almost fully out of the water and still rising straight up into the air. If I still had any doubts that it was Ciara at that point, they were erased once I saw the face. The eyes were open and stared at me unblinking, long hair dark hair hung upside down, the ends nearly above the surface.

Instead of leaving with me like I had begged, Ciara went *closer* to the water. I turned around, just for a moment to survey the area. I was trying to see if anyone could help, but everyone around us seemed oblivious – most of the people in the line at the tent were gone, too.

When I turned back, many of the figures had disappeared –  to my relief –  but mine was still rising out. By then, it was nearly up to the waist. Ciara was leaning close to the water – eyes wide, mouth agape slightly – she was so close that I feared she was going to fall in. Her face was wet, as was her long hair – parts of it were hanging down into the water itself.  Even though her dark copy was gone my heart still pounded, a part of my brain screamed at me that we were in danger.

I watched helplessly as my own shadow figure arose, out up to the shoulders. I realized that Ciara was staring at it – she could finally see it. I backed away instinctively only to find myself cornered against a nearby store front, which had become dark and dingy as if it hadn’t seen a customer in decades.

As I braced for something I couldn’t even imagine, just as quickly as it had happened, things were suddenly back to normal.

The lights around us were white, and green, and red again. Music that I recognized was playing. Ciara was still staring into the water, but it was placid again.

I noticed something, though. The surface reflected the lights on the trees and the storefronts all around us, but not a single person other than myself. It was if I was standing all alone along the banks.

Before I could process *that* thought further, I heard screams and shouting coming from the  tent. I didn’t know what had happened over there at the time, but people were running around in a panic.

I turned back to Ciara, but she was gone. I looked but couldn’t find her anywhere so at a loss of what to do, I eventually left too.

I still don’t know what exactly I witnessed. I saw a clip of what they’d found near and outside of the tent on the news, where there were interviews with sobbing witnesses juxtaposed with shots of crimson splatters, warm blood had melted the snow. They didn’t say what caused it or mention the lights or shadowy figures at all.

Ciara hasn’t answered my calls or texts, and I’ve noticed that many of my neighbors’ homes are totally unlit –  inside and out. It seems like for every night that passes, another house goes completely dark.

My block used to go all out when decorating, but yards that were once illuminated by strings upon strings of lights now sit empty and dark amongst the shadows. My next-door neighbor’s once cheerfully lit inflatables are now sad looking, their limp and sagging forms collapsed on the ground.

My work is still open, but some of my locally based coworkers have stopped logging in. My boss mused that they must have started their holiday early, but I’m not so sure.

I don't know what's happening, but I don’t think my town is in for a merry Christmas this year.

Oh, and I’m never leaving my house again.
