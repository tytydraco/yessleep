TWO NIGHTS IN VENICE
Chapter 2.

Karl, I like that just moving slowly enjoying ourselves looking at the looking at the views and the beautiful old architecture in the waters of Venice, when are we going to do that?

In the morning, I have booked the gondola for all of Saturday up to 7 pm. On the night it will drop us off at the pier of the restaurant on the Grand Canal for dinner are you okay with that?

It sounds like a perfect day, I can't wait until tomorrow, so in the meantime, I think we should get a little bit naughty and the bedroom, are you okay with that?

I like being naughty Rosie, especially in the shower with you, what was that, did you feel it?

I felt nothing, what are you feeling?

It was like a rumbling coming up from the ground, and I could hear a very low humming sound, and now it's starting to rain heavily.

Come to bed and make me hum with pleasure. 

Good morning my love, time to get up, we have to be ready this morning for the gondola at 9 am. For a full day on the Grand Canal, you go and have a shower and I will have breakfast sent up, I love you, my beautiful lady.

I love you, please order me lots of coffee. 

I have ordered breakfast, I just want to see the news.

Good morning and welcome to the morning news, the major headlines this morning, the Earth has been shaking throughout the night in the Yellow Sea, causing earthquakes and tsunamis in North Korea and Russia, darkness has fallen across both countries caused by a black swelling skys in both countries and hundreds of thousands of people have disappeared their whereabouts are unknown.

Scientists from around the world are gathering to create an emergency response scientific team, to try and find out what this horror is causing all these events, we are waiting for more updated information to come in please keep watching. 

This is not natural what the hell is going on with this planet, it's like the prophecy of Armageddon coming true, what's next volcanic activity around the world, now am talking to myself.

Karl, I have finished in the shower, I hope that you have ordered breakfast, I am hungry, and I am looking forward to a day out on the gondola, Karl are you listening to me? 

Yes am sorry I was just watching the news, breakfast is here now, and I will have a shower I'll be quick. 

That was a nice breakfast, let's go and see Venice, you look beautiful, I'm going to be happy to be with you for the next few days Rosie. 

This place is more beautiful and impressive
When you are in a gondola moving slowly down the Grand Canal, it's hard to believe that this place is built on marshlands, what was that?

I don't know, I didn't see what it was, what have you seen? 

I'm not sure it just shot by quickly, it looked long and black, look there's another one whatever they are it's very fast.

Rosie, can you describe what you are seeing in the water and how many are there?

They are as long as this gondola and very black that's all I'm getting to see, they move very fast but the water is not moving as they go by, it is as if the water is not being disturbed by the movements, I think they might be dolphins I know that they come into these Waters.

Excuse me, young lady, I saw those black Shadows in the water, I have been working on these canals for over 30 years, and I have never seen anything like that before, it is a very strange day, today even the waters are higher this morning something is not right, I can see it in the sky, something isn't right.

The canals aren't very busy today where is everybody? Is it a holiday for them, it's really quiet it feels as if I have this Grand Canal all to myself it's nice and peaceful.

Karl, am hungry can we stop for lunch and have a look at the shops, my bottom is going numb.

Yes, let's go and have a walk around and have a look, you can do a bit of shopping. 
Can you please pull over we want to go shopping. 

That would be better for you because the water level is rising, not good to be on the water, I will take you two to the steps over there, please let me tell you stay off the water now, I have seen more of those black creatures not good, enjoy your holiday.

Why are all the streets empty, look at the people running about let me ask this lady.

Excuse me can you please tell me what's going on where are the people, and why are you all running about what has happened?

Haven't you been watching the news, a mega earthquake just happened in the country of China, it happened in the area where the mountains are, luckily not in the overpopulated cities, hundreds and thousands of people could have been killed.

I have just been watching it on the news but you can't see the mountains because there is a black swelling fog covering mountains, the news is saying that there are reports of people seeing strange black creatures moving in the waters and across the land, where all these disasters are happening, I think that the world is coming to an end just like it says in the Bible.

It started with North Korea Russia, and now China, whatever's going on it seems like the Earth's crust and moving. 

Rosie when you show those black figures in the water did you have any chance to see what they look like, if people are seeing what you saw, then it may be something not of this earth going on, having three earthquakes separately in three places with two tsunamis that hit two countries,
