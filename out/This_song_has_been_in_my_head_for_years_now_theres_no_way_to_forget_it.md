This song started to hear In my mind for no reason I hear this so many times and I still remember the lyric let me tell the lyrics (lyrics maybe curse)

Lyrics : Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay
Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach ya
But then you came closer
Hopin' you will give me a chance

Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends?
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
She like a song played again and again

(That girl) like something off a poster
(That girl) is a dime they say
(That girl) is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay

Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'til the morn
Girl, you really change my life

Doing things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cooking things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

(That girl) like something off a poster
(That girl) is a dime they say
(That girl) is the gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay

Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay
Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay

I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me, ay
I can be your melody
Oh, girl, I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me, ay

Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na
Shawty got me singing
Na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na-na na
Now she got me singing

Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay
Shawty's like a melody in my head that I can't keep out
Got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay
