[Just a Door](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oyoy9u/it_was_just_a_door)

At first, there was nothing. Then, I was at home.

Everything seemed correct, except the splitting headache going on inside me. I looked at my phone and realized that I had work in an hour. It would seem that I had slept the weekend away, just great. 

That was when the smell hit me. Confused, I slowly crept out of bed, and made my way to the kitchen. The curtains were still closed so darkness permeated the living room, except for a sliver of light coming around the corner that would lead to the small apartment kitchen that I've had for years. I peaked around the corner, bracing myself for anything, only to find a tall man in boxers standing over a sizzling pan of Sausage and Eggs. 

  
The smell truly hit my nostrils full force at that moment, making my stomach growl. The man snapped his head towards me and smiled. "Morning sleepy head! I thought I would go ahead and make you some breakfast." His words came out like a warm breeze, instantly calming me. Though, I know that I had never met this man in my life. 

  
I stammered, "who are you and what are you doing in my apartment?" backing away, looking for something to defend myself with. Unfortunately, I never got into any sports that had club like instruments, only Basketball. 

The man chuckled, "It's me Kade. Your husband, Kai? Are you okay?"

  
I was able to find an old gaming computer with some weight behind and decided it would be my weapon of choice. "I do not know who you are, but get out of my apartment, now!" I was shaking on the inside, but I hope it did not show. 

  
"Kade, it is okay, you slept through the weekend, which would explain the confusion. Also, are you really going to fight me naked with a keyboard?" Kai smirked a little while he said that, turning his attention back to the breakfast. 

  
I looked down and realized that I was in fact naked, though I could barely register that as a splitting headache passed through me, making me drop the keyboard. Memories rushed inside my head.

Kai, standing in the rain asking me on a date and me stuttering as I accepted. Kai getting on one knee in the exact same location, though now with a few more gray hairs, asking me to marry him, and me crying I said sure why not. One by one a new line of memories unfolded before, shaping this life of who Kai was to me. 

The keyboard clattered to the floor as I shank to the floor. Kai turned of the stove and rushed to me. "Are you okay? Had I known you were not feeling well, I would not have let you sleep like you did."

I looked up at him and quickly hugged him. "I'm sorry hun, I don't know what came over me." We sat like that for a minute, only the faint sound of sizzling breakfast meet being heard over my labored breathing. 

Once I had calmed down, we got up, got dressed, and sat down for a meal. Kai watched me with concern, and finally asked, "Are you sure you should go to work today?" I laughed and nodded, ensuring him I was fine.

"Yes, I need to go and make some money. But first, let me take !@#!@ for a walk." When I said the name though, it sounded like static from a tv, a sound my mouth should not have been able to make. 

"Walk who Kade?" Kai grew more concerned as I spun around, realizing that we were the only two living things in the apartment. My head tilted again as I searched my memories for an answer about why I said that. 

"I... don't know." I finally answered, turning back to my empty plate. Without a word I got up and washed my dish. "Must have really slept like the dead for this much confusion" I laughed and wrapped my arms around Kai. "It will be okay, I am okay. I will see you later when I get off work okay?"

Kai hesitated at first, obviously not convinced that I was good enough to go to work. "Okay Kade, I love you." 

"I love you too." I say with a kiss and head out the door. 

Though, for some reason, there was still something in the back of my head telling me that I had forgotten something.
