When I got into my accident last year I woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family.

I was disoriented, eyes closed-listening to the sound of muffled sobs. I’d just come out of a terrible nightmare- filled with metal, darkness, and pressure. Hushed whispers and muffled comments filled my head. My mouth felt like it was filled with cotton.

*…This isn’t fair. He was just driving home. Fuck drunk drivers and fuck this…”*

*“Is he going to be okay? When should he wake up, it’s been fifteen minutes since sur….”*

*”Shouldn’t someone be back by now? How long does it take to find the ….”*

Fuck what? Where was I?

I tried to move but my body was slow, sluggish.
I heard a steady beeping. The soft hum of machines. Could smell antiseptic. Then I heard something terrible.

Through the sound of quiet sobs and steady breathing someone said-

*“I can’t believe they couldn’t save his arm.”*

My eyes flared opened. The beeping starting to increase in pace. I struggled to focus against the light in the room. In the … *hospital room.*

No. No, no, no. **Please God, no.**

My family ran over, flurried sounds of movement and a barrage of concern.

I ignored them all.

I was paralyzed by fear. The seconds that passed felt like hours. I tried to lift my arms. 

I felt both of them then, heavy but numb.

Relief crashed through me hard and swift, like a wave pouring cold liquid down my spine. I sighed, feeling the tension dissipate. 

Someone was holding onto my hand. Gripping it tightly.

I looked at my arms, ready to assess what the damage was.

I could only see one under the sheet. I began to shake, my brain losing all functioning thought and reason. I turned my head to the right. 

*“Get the nurse, get the doctor, get someone! He’s finally awa-.”*

My arm was missing. All that was there was a tightly wrapped stump off of my shoulder. A sling compressed it further.

It was gone. It wasn’t a nightmare. I was awake.

**No one was holding my hand.**

⸻

The months after were hard. I met with countless doctors. Went to physical therapy, talked to my family, had visits from my friends… people came and went like rotating ghosts. Everyone said the same things:

*“You’re so strong.”*

*“I can only imagine what you’re going through.”*

*“I’m so sorry, thank God it wasn’t worse”*

Even with the bandages, the meds, the exercises, the reality of it didn’t settle in the way people said it would. Everyone talked like adjustment was linear, like grief stepped aside neatly with time.

But no one warned me about the quiet moments. When I’d wake up reaching for water with a hand that wasn’t there. When I’d turn to scratch my shoulder and feel my muscles move, except they didn’t. When my brain would swear I could feel the brush of my blanket sliding against fingers I physically no longer had. 

But most often, the sensation  that someone was gripping onto my missing hand tightly. To the point where it passed the level of comfort, it felt animalistic. Too strong, almost painful.

⸻

Phantom limb, my doctor called it.
*”Common.”*
*“Normal.”*
*“It’ll lessen with therapy.”*

But it wasn’t just a sensation. It wasn’t pins and needles or heat or the ache of something lost.

**It felt *real* dammit.**

Most people tried to skirt around the night it all went wrong. None of them ever asked about the accident itself. There was an assumed belief that because I was hit head on- there wasn’t “my side”.

But there was, I remembered it.

⸻

They said I was unconscious when the paramedics found me, that I never woke up at the scene. Anything I *“remembered”* was my brains feeble way of coping, putting a bandaid over a gaping wound.

They’re wrong.

I remember *everything*. What really happened that night. 

Not in sharp frames like a movie, but in sensations. Hot, cold, pressure, weight. The smell of gasoline. The crunch of metal collapsing. The strange, ringing silence that happens right after impact.

I remember my head hanging sideways, vision doubled, blurred, blooming in and out like a dying camera lens. I remember trying to breathe but feeling like my lungs were tied up with wire.

And I remember my right arm.

*Pinned.*

**Crushed.**

Or at least… *that’s what should’ve happened.*

Because when I reached for something, anything, to pull myself up, *my hand didn’t hit metal.*

It hit air.

Not normal air.
Thick, hot, vibrating air. Like touching the space above a stovetop burner.

And something in that air touched back.

Not lightly.
Unmistakable.

It *grabbed* me, palm to palm, like it had been waiting.

I should have died right then. The paramedics said so later, quietly, in the hallway when they thought I was asleep. “He shouldn’t have made it,” they whispered.

They were right.

Because in that moment, pressed between two worlds, I felt myself slipping. My body fading while something tugged on my arm from the other side.

It wasn’t a hand. Not really.
But it shaped itself like one for *me.*

**It was curious.**

**Cold.**

**Hungry.**

And when it touched me, I felt everything it was made of. Screams, heat, pressure, and a depth so endless it had a weight to it. A place where noise didn’t echo because there was no space left for it to go.

Hell isn’t fire.
It’s being compressed until your thoughts can’t expand.
Millions of lost things piled on top of each other until everything feels like suffocation.

I felt that.

Through my arm.

Through that connection.

And the last thing I remember before blacking out wasn’t pain, it was the overwhelming certainty that something was leached from me in that moment.

When I woke up in the hospital with my arm gone, wrapped neatly- sanitized, bandaged like a textbook medical case. That connection wasn’t gone.

Because I could still feel my arm.

Not phantom limb.
Not nerve misfires.

Something else.

**Something still holding my hand.**

⸻

Nowadays the majority of friends have stopped checking in. They think I’ve adjusted. It’s been a year- I have my first prosthetic. A detachable piece of flesh colored silicone, inflexible. Cold. Clumsy. 

My family still talks about survival like it’s a blessing.

Like crawling out of a wreck you shouldn’t have lived through is some divine miracle.

But over the last year I’ve realized something awful:

I was never meant to survive that night.

I didn’t *”cheat death.”*

I slipped out of something’s grasp.

And it wants its hold back.

It’s been changing. The squeezing has hit a peak. The pressure has heightened.The same crushing density I felt in the car. That weight of a place too crowded for space to exist.

And when the pressure touches me now, I remember the moment before I blacked out. How that thing groped my essence.

It wasn’t grabbing my arm.
It was grabbing me.

The arm was just the only part of me it could reach.

Now I understand why the paramedics whispered I “shouldn’t have made it.”
Because I didn’t escape a drunk driver.

I escaped whatever is on the other side of that vibrating air.

**And it noticed.**

It’s been trying to find me again, not through the world but through the *connection* it made. The one stretched thin when they pulled me from the wreck and cut my arm away to free me.

It’s just been trying to finish pulling.

Over the past month the sensations have spread.
The pressure crawled from the missing wrist to the shoulder.
From the shoulder into my ribs.
From my ribs to my spine.

Like it’s searching for the rest of what it touched.
The rest of what it marked.
The rest of me.

And tonight… it found something. I think it found *me*.

⸻

About an hour ago, the room went silent. Not quiet. **Silent**.

Like the air thickened into molasses and trapped the sound inside it.

My ears popped.

My vision dimmed at the edges.

My breath felt heavy and wet, impossible to breathe.

It was the same feeling I had in the car.

Except back then, only my arm was inside that… place.

Now the pressure is wrapping around my whole body.

Not squeezing.

Claiming.

And I can feel it thinking.

God help me, I can feel it *recognizing me.*

Like a hand patting pockets to find a missing item and *finally* feeling the shape it’s been searching for.

My missing arm isn’t what connects us.

I am.

And as I’m typing this, my vision is starting to double the same way it did that night. Blooming in and out like a camera lens drowning in static.

The air around me is vibrating.
Close.
Hot.
Too dense to breathe.

It’s not pulling my phantom hand anymore.

It’s pulling all of me.

Slow.
Steady.
Certain.

Like I’m the overdue half of a bargain I never agreed to.

I wasn’t supposed to wake up in that hospital bed.

**It was interrupted.**

And now that the thing from that place has found me again.

Now that the pressure is pushing through the walls, the floor, the air. 

Now that it’s curling around my spine like a new organ.

It didn’t take my arm.
It left it.
As a marker.
A claim.
A reminder of what it didn’t get to finish.

My ears are ringing.
My bones feel like they’re hollowing out from the inside.
My chest is tightening. Not just from panic, but from something pressing inward, inward, inward.

There’s no light.
Just weight.

Just density.

Just… inside-out gravity.

It’s here.

It remembers me.

**And this time, nothing is going to pull me back.**
