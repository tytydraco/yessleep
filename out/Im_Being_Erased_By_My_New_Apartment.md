I don’t think I have much time left, so I’m going to try and get this all out before there’s nothing left of me that remembers how.

If this feels dramatic, I’m sorry. I know how it sounds. I know how that title looks and if I’d read something like this a month ago, I would’ve, just like you, justifiably, rolled my eyes, assumed it was some attempt at creepy internet fiction, and moved on.

But I don’t think I exist anywhere else anymore. Not really. And if I don’t write this down now, I’m afraid the only place I’ll exist at all is inside these walls.

My name doesn’t matter. Even if I gave it, I’m not sure anyone who used to know me would recognize it. Or remember. Or care. 

A month ago, I was living with someone I loved. I’d moved across the state for her. New city, new job, new everything. I left what little family I had and the handful of friends I trusted because I thought, stupidly, that this was my chance at a real life. A shared one.

We’d been together three years. We’d had fights, sure. But I thought that was normal. I thought we’d do the messy, difficult thing and come out the other side stronger. I thought we’d have kids one day. I thought I had time.

Turns out I didn’t.

One morning, she woke up quiet. Too quiet. She wouldn’t meet my eyes. She sat on the edge of the bed, hands twisted in the sheets, and told me she “needed space.” It was the kind of phrase that doesn’t sound real when it lands. Like something from a show you don’t watch closely.

By that evening the space she needed was the entire apartment, and I was the thing that didn’t belong in it.

It wasn’t a screaming match. She was calm, almost gentle. That somehow made it worse. She had clearly been living with this decision long before I knew it existed. To her, it was already over. To me, it ended in a single day.

I didn’t have family to run to. I’d burned too many bridges trying to keep my head above water for the last few years to have anyone I could crash with. The job I’d moved here for barely covered my half of the rent we used to split. Alone, it was impossible.

So there I was: one suitcase, a backpack, half a charge on my phone, and nowhere to go that night except out.

It’s funny how quickly your life shrinks down to immediate needs. You stop thinking about goals or dreams or five year plans. Everything becomes: 
“Where am I going to sleep?” 
“What can I eat that doesn’t cost anything?” 
“How long before she changes the locks?”

I sat in a cheap diner nursing a coffee I couldn’t afford, scrolling rental listings like I was looking through the obituaries. Everything was too expensive, too far, too “must have three times monthly income” for someone who’d just watched their life implode.

Then I found it.

“Studio apartment. $350/month. Immediate move-in. No deposit. No credit check. No questions.”

If that sets off alarm bells for you, congratulations, you’re doing better than I was.

At the time it felt like a hand reaching down into a pit and grabbing me by the collar. I didn’t think about why it was so cheap. I didn’t think about why there were no photos of the inside. I didn’t think about why the listing said “vacant long-term” in small gray letters at the bottom.

I just saw the word “immediate.”

I called. A man picked up on the second ring, like he’d been sitting there waiting.

“Yeah,” he said, after I asked if the unit was really available. “You can come by today if you want.”

There was no application. No awkward tour. He met me in the lobby, slid a clipboard across a dusty little table, and pointed to a spot to sign. His eyes looked tired in a way that made me feel guilty for existing.

“Place has been empty a while,” he said, handing me the key. “People like newer buildings these days.”

It didn’t sound convincing then. It sounds even less convincing now.

The first time I walked into the apartment, it felt…unremarkable. That’s the best way I can put it. Old beige walls, scuffed floorboards, a kitchen that had seen better decades. The air had that stale, faintly sour smell of a place that had been closed up too long.

But it was quiet. 
It was mine. 

For the first time since that morning, I closed a door and no one was on the other side waiting to tell me to leave.

I slept on the floor that night, my rolled up hoodie as a pillow, my suitcase as a nightstand. I cried a little. Not in the loud, cinematic way. Just that dry, exhausted crying where your face crumples and your body shakes but nothing much comes out.

I told myself it would be okay. I had a place. A starting point. I could rebuild from here.

I really believed that.

The next morning, I found my wallet in the freezer.

I stared at it for a full minute before touching it, like it might be some kind of trap. Frost had collected around the leather. My cards were stiff inside. I had no memory of putting it there.

My brain tried to make sense of it.

You were exhausted.
You’re grieving.
You were half asleep.
You probably put it there without thinking.

It wasn’t like it levitated inside the fridge overnight. If anyone had moved it, it had to be me. There was no one else.

So I forced myself to laugh, a thin, hollow sound that bounced off the cabinets and died.

“Nice one,” I muttered to myself. “You’re really nailing this ‘new start’ thing.”

I decided to be more careful. To pay attention when I put things down. To stop drifting around in that numb haze where everything feels like it’s happening in a dream.

It didn’t matter.

The next day, the bathroom door handle felt…wrong.

It was just a little thing. The knob seemed a few inches closer to the hall than I remembered. I measured it with my hand, palm to frame, like that would prove anything. I told myself I was used to the layout of my old place, the one I’d shared with her. Muscle memory. That was all.

But once you start doubting your perception, it spreads. It’s like a crack in glass. Small at first, then branching out like a spiderweb covering everything.

On the third morning, I woke up to find my suitcase fully unpacked.

Every shirt folded and placed in drawers. Jeans hung neatly in the closet. Toiletries lined up on the bathroom sink. Even my socks were paired, which is something I rarely bothered with even on good days.

I sat on the edge of the mattress I’d dragged in and tried to remember doing it. Maybe last night? Maybe I’d finally snapped out of it and done something productive and my brain had just…erased the effort?

But I couldn’t place the feeling. No vague flash of folding, no sense of “oh, right.” Just a blank.

“Okay,” I whispered. “You’re tired. You’re sad. That’s all. People forget things all the time.”

I started leaving my phone’s voice recorder on when I went to sleep, just to prove to myself I wasn’t doing things and forgetting them. That’s how far it got, that early. Me, arguing with empty air and my own reflection like I could win.

The first time I played one of those recordings back, it was just eight hours of soft breathing, occasional shifts of the mattress, and the distant hum of pipes in the walls.

No footsteps.
No sounds of drawers opening.
No rustling of clothes.

But when I checked the apartment again, the couch had moved six inches to the left.

It was around then that I found the first note.

I only saw it because I dropped a razor behind the toilet and had to bend down and shove my hand behind the tank to fish it out. The porcelain on the back of the tank was dusty, except for a finger wiped line where someone had placed a folded scrap of lined paper.

I unfolded it with wet hands, trying not to smear the ink.

‘Stop sleeping if you want to stay you’

That’s all it said.

No name. No date. The handwriting was jagged, like it had been written in a hurry or with shaking hands.

I laughed when I read it, but it stuck in my head like a splinter. Every time my eyes drifted shut after that, I saw those words.

Still, people leave weird shit behind. It didn’t have to mean anything. Maybe some teenager wrote it to freak out a roommate. Maybe it was some kind of edgy inside joke. Apartment graffiti.

That’s what I thought, until I found the second one.

It was under the fridge. I only noticed it because something kept rattling every time I walked past, a thin bump, bump, bump, like a trapped insect. When I pulled the fridge forward, a folded note slid out and fluttered onto my sock.

The dust underneath looked undisturbed, like nothing had been moved in years.

The note itself, like the other, had one line written in the same hastily inked font. 

‘The doors move when you do’

I didn’t laugh at that one.

After that, I started looking. I tore through the kitchen cabinets, checked under drawer liners, ran my fingers along the undersides of shelves. The apartment didn’t make me work hard.

In the cabinet above the sink, on the back panel, someone had written a phrase in faint pencil. 

‘It rearranges us first’

The word “us” landed in my gut like a stone.

I stared at that sentence so long my eyes burned. The light in the kitchen buzzed and flickered above me. Outside the small window, I could hear the muffled sounds of traffic, people talking, normal city noise. Life continuing in straight lines while mine curled in on itself inside my cramped studio.

I told myself that if someone had gone through the effort of hiding notes like that, they were probably not in a good place mentally. That didn’t mean they were right. It just meant they were scared.

The problem was, I was scared too.

From then on, the changes came quicker.

I’d walk from the kitchen to the bathroom and notice that the hallway felt two steps longer. Not a lot. Just enough that my body registered the difference a split second before my brain caught up. Like a song played at the wrong speed.

The bathroom mirror seemed slightly taller one morning. The towel rack a few inches lower. The light switch on the opposite side of the frame. I stood there with my hand in the air, fingers groping for a switch that wasn’t there anymore.

“You’re thinking of the old place,” I muttered. “Her place. Stop doing that. It’s not the same layout.”

But my pulse was pounding so hard my vision trembled.

Objects moved too. Not just my wallet and toothbrush. Bigger things. The mattress shifted closer to the window. The kitchen table edged toward the door. Once, I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed and my shoes lined up neatly beside my face on the floor, toes pointing inward like they had been watching me sleep.

I stopped sleeping well. I’d jolt awake multiple times a night with the sick feeling that someone had just stepped out of the room. My dreams, when I had them, were of hallways that never ended and doors that opened into copies of the same room over and over.

I became hyperaware of the walls. Of the way sound moved through them. Of tiny, almost imperceptible creaks that seemed to answer my breathing. I’d hold my breath and swear I could hear the apartment exhale.

On Day 9, if you can call them days, when you barely sleep time feels like chewing gum, I noticed the vent cover in the main room was slightly crooked.

It hadn’t been crooked before. I was sure of that. The screws on the bottom right corner were pulled out a bit, exposing a thin slice of darkness.

I don’t know why I dragged a chair over and stood on it. Some part of me already knew nothing good comes out of opening hidden spaces in horror stories. But this wasn’t supposed to be a horror story. It was supposed to be my life.

Behind the vent was a shoebox pressed tight into the duct. It took a stupid amount of yanking and swearing to pull it free, dust cascading down onto my face.

Inside were photos.

Some old, some newer. Different sizes, different types of paper. All of them had been taken in this apartment.

An older man sitting on the edge of the bed, staring toward the door with wide, hollow eyes.

A woman crouched in the corner of the kitchen, her hands clamped over her ears, mouth open in a sound the photograph couldn’t capture.

A kid, maybe eight years old, standing in the bathroom doorway, half of his body blurred like he’d been moving as the picture developed.

And one Polaroid with a date scribbled on the white border. ‘Six years ago.’ A man stands in the middle of the main room, shoulders slumped, looking past the camera. He looks tired in a way that made my chest hurt.

Behind him, the apartment looks…wrong.

The hallway is longer than it is now. Or maybe narrower. The perspective feels off, like one of those optical illusions where lines bend where they shouldn’t. The walls seem to tilt inward. The door to the bathroom is where my kitchen window should be.

I put the lid back on the box and shoved it away from me like it might bite.

It didn’t occur to me right away that, if those photos were here, those people weren’t.

Not until I found the tapes.

They were in the coat closet. I found them when my jacket sleeve caught on a nail and when I yanked the sleeve away to hard it pulled back a slice of drywall just enough to reveal the edge of a plastic case. Behind the loose panel was a narrow cavity full of junk, old receipts, a cracked phone, socks with no pair.

And a small camcorder, battery compartment crusted with age.

I found a charger at a pawn shop two blocks away. I almost didn’t go. A very, very rational part of me wanted to throw the camera out and move on. But curiosity does the same thing desperation does. It makes you ignore warning signs.

The battery took a charge. Against my better judgment, I hit play on the first file.

The screen lit up with the same walls I was sitting between.

The man from the Polaroid sat on the floor, back against the bathroom door, hair sticking out in sweaty clumps. His voice shook when he spoke.

“If anyone finds this,” he said, “don’t…don’t move in here. It learns you. I know that sounds crazy. I thought it was me at first. Stress. Drinking. Whatever. I thought I was just losing it.”

He laughed, a frayed sound, eyes darting around like he expected the apartment to interrupt him.

“It moves things. Just little things, at first. You’ll think you’re doing it. That’s how it gets you. It makes you doubt yourself. Then it starts changing the rooms. The doors don’t stay put. You wake up and the hallway is longer, or the bathroom’s on the wrong side. You try to leave and end up back where you started. It…”

The video glitched. Lines of static crawled down the screen.

When the image stabilized, he was closer. Sitting where I was sitting now. He looked straight into the camera.

“Once it knows you,” he whispered, “it keeps you.”

The footage cut off.

I sat there for a long time after the screen went black, listening to the soft wheeze of the camcorder and the thud of my heart. My reflection in the darkened TV looked pale and stretched.

The thing about hearing someone else describe your nightmare is that it doesn’t make it less real. It just means someone else was awake before you.

After that, everything got worse.

Sometimes I’d walk to the front door and there’d be a little extra space between it and the wall. Sometimes less. Once, I reached for the knob and my hand closed on empty air. No door. Just unbroken wall where it should’ve been. I blinked, and it was back.

The cheap ceiling light in the main room seemed higher each day. The kitchen felt narrower, forcing my shoulders inward as I moved. The bathroom mirror showed more wall behind me than there should have been.

I’d put my keys on the counter and turn around to find them on the floor. I’d swear I’d left the faucet off and hear water running anyway. I’d find food in the fridge I didn’t remember buying, half a jar of pickles, a slice of birthday cake in a plastic container, a Chinese takeout box with someone else’s handwriting on it.

The handwriting that started showing up in the margins of my own notebooks.

Sometimes it looked like mine. Sometimes like someone else’s. Sometimes like it was trying to be mine and not quite getting there.

Little notes, in the corners.

‘It remembers where you stood’ 
‘Stop trying to leave’ 
‘It’s been longer than you think’

I started having gaps in my memory. Not small, forget-where-you-put-your-keys gaps. Whole evenings gone. I’d look up and realize the light had changed, and I didn’t know what I’d done in the hours between.

Once, I came to standing in the bathroom, my hands pressed flat against the mirror. Written across the glass in soap, in my handwriting, were the words:

‘You’re apart of the layout now’

I wiped it away so fast I cut my knuckle on the edge of the frame.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here now. The days stopped lining up after a while. My phone’s clock keeps glitching, resetting to strange times. Sometimes the date jumps backward. Once it showed a year that hasn’t happened yet.

Calls don’t go through. Texts sit in “sending” limbo until I receive the ‘failed to send’ message or they vanish completely. The few people I managed to contact early on either didn’t respond or sent one word replies that didn’t sound like them.

Did I actually call them? Did I dream it? Did I imagine their voices? It’s getting harder to separate what I know from what the apartment wants me to think.

I’ve found other things, too. An envelope wedged under a floorboard, full of expired IDs from people I’ve never met. A ring at the back of a kitchen drawer. A pair of glasses on top of the cabinet so dusty they must have sat there for years.

None of it is mine. All of it is in my home.

Sometimes, late at night, when I sit very still and force myself not to cry, I swear I can feel the apartment thinking. Not with a mind, exactly. With intention.

The walls feel too close. The corners feel like they’re folding inward. The air tastes stale, dead, like it’s been exhaled too many times.

I keep catching myself doing things I don’t remember deciding to do. Rearranging the table. Moving the mattress. Closing doors I don’t remember opening. Once, I woke up with dust under my fingernails and the vent cover on the floor. The shoebox was back inside the duct, as if I had carefully put it there.

I don’t remember doing that. But the box didn’t walk back on its own.

That’s what scares me the most now. Not that the apartment is changing, but that it’s making me part of the process. Like I’m one more component it’s rearranging. One more piece of furniture it’s finding a place for.

When I listen very hard, I feel like I can hear echoes behind the plaster. Not voices, exactly. Just the sense of others. People who stood where I’m standing. People who thought they were getting a second chance with cheap rent and no questions. People who left notes and tapes and warnings that no one came in time to read.

I don’t think anyone came for them. I don’t think anyone remembered they were here once the apartment finished with them.

I can feel it finishing with me.

My thoughts are getting thinner. Sometimes I reread what I just wrote and it feels like someone else’s story. Sometimes I catch my reflection out of the corner of my eye and don’t recognize myself. For a split second, I see someone older. Or younger. Or someone who isn’t me at all.

I don’t know how this is going to end for me. I don’t know if there’ll be a body for anyone to find. I don’t know if the landlord really knows what this place does or if he just sees tenants go in and lists go back up when they “move out.”

All I know is that the apartment doesn’t like emptiness. It fills itself. With belongings. With memories. With people who think they have nowhere else to go.

If you’re reading this, and any of it sounds familiar, if you’ve ever walked into a too-cheap, too-empty place and felt it watching you back, please listen.

Don’t come looking for me.
Don’t try to find this building.
Don’t answer any listing that sounds like mine.

And if you ever see a studio advertised as “vacant long-term, immediate move in, no questions asked” for far less than it should cost…

don’t move in.

The apartment I’m in is empty again.

And it’s waiting.
