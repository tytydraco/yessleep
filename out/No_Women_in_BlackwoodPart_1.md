If you’re reading this, I’m already dead. Right now, I’m climbing the spiral staircase to the topmost floor of the lighthouse at the edge of town. When I reach the lantern room, I’ll throw myself to the jagged rocks below. Better to be claimed by the sea than enslaved to that thing.

I am a 56-year-old man from a small seaside town in California called Blackwood. For the safety of my family, I dare not reveal my name. From this point on, I will only be known as Anon.

It was July of 1983, and I was fourteen — an age when most boys were sneaking beers at parties, chasing pretty girls, and fumbling toward their first real kisses.

But not in Blackwood.

Blackwood wasn’t like other towns on the California coast. The beaches were the same, the salt wind the same, but the people… they were relics, clinging to ideas long buried elsewhere. The town was damn near puritan. No music blasting from boomboxes at sunrise. No neon glow of arcades. No posters of Madonna or Michael Jackson. Even the games in our rec center were years behind — old Atari cabinets with pixelated beeps instead of roars.

Everything in Blackwood had a place. Every boy, every girl, a role. Boys were drilled in toughness, silence, obedience. Girls… well, girls were sent away to a special school, learning God-knows-what while we were left to stumble blind. I had never seen a girl older than eleven.

I grew up without a mother. My father was a deadbeat alcoholic who spent more time on the bar stools than at home. I hated him. My childhood smelled of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and the kind of silence that makes your skin crawl.

That day, I was with my friends at the abandoned café by the pier. Its windows were boarded, its paint peeling, the walls thick with mildew and old coffee — but it was ours. We passed a bottle of cheap beer around, laughing, killing time.

“Dude, this arcade game’s garbage,” muttered Vince, nudging the battered console Tommy had smuggled out of his garage. “I know,” I said, taking a swig. “It’s all just pixels. Who even likes these things?” “Your mom?” Tommy grinned. “Shut up,” I shot back, though I was laughing too.

We joked about girls we’d never had, movies we’d never sneak into, dares we’d never take. For a while, we felt free.

Then came the sirens.

Two patrol cars screeched to a halt outside, red and blue lights painting the café walls. “Shit,” Vince muttered, staring at the boarded windows as though they’d suddenly gone transparent.

The cops stormed in, flashlights slicing through the dark. “Everybody out! Now!”

We froze. Then bolted. Predictably, we didn’t make it far.

The night ended at the Blackwood police station.

“Why were you there?” the officer barked. “Trespassing. Underage drinking. You know the rules.”

We sat slouched in hard chairs, reeking of sweat and cheap beer. I tried to look bored, but my eyes wandered — and that’s when I saw her.

A girl. My age, maybe fourteen. Blonde. And pregnant. A belly no one that young should have. Her skin was pale, her eyes sunken, shadowed, like she hadn’t slept in weeks.

I whispered something crude under my breath, because that’s what boys do when confronted with the impossible.

And then she stared at me. Not at anyone else. Me. Her gaze burned through me as she walked forward.

“GET OUT!” she screamed.

I jolted upright, nearly leaping from the chair. The room spun.

The cop’s voice cut through the panic. “Hey! Sit down, kid. You fell asleep on me. Quit nodding off.”

I swallowed hard, my pulse hammering. The girl — gone, of course. Just a dream, I told myself. Just a dream. But the terror lingered.

This is the first woman I have ever seen. I never had a mother. I have never seen a woman past the age of eleven. After eleven, they just… disappear. There are no explanations, no reports. Just gone. It is as if the entire town chooses to forget they exist.

I questioned it when I was younger. It never went well. I was either gaslit into believing they never existed, or my dad would beat the foolishness out of me. And I went along with it. We were taught blind obedience from the cradle. So I learned not to question him. Or anything.

That night, I came home to chaos. My father stood waiting in the kitchen, a bottle in one hand, a belt in the other. His face red, twisted, drunk.

“You think you can wander off, drinking beer like some damn fool? Do you know how much trouble you’ve caused me, boy?” Spittle flew with every word.

I tried to explain, but he cut me off. “Don’t you dare open your mouth! You’ll learn respect the hard way.”

The belt cracked — once on the floor, then across my arm, then my back. Pain bloomed like fire. I didn’t scream. I never did. Not then, not ever.

“You’re nothing without me, boy! Remember that!”

When he finally stumbled off to drown himself in whiskey, I crawled to my room. My body throbbed, my ears rang, and her face wouldn’t leave me. The girl. Pale. Hollow-eyed. Pregnant. Her gaze burning through me.

Sleep came late, and when it did, it betrayed me.

I had no body, no face. I drifted above Blackwood like a shadow. The streets stretched endlessly. The small, square library pulled at me like a magnet.

Inside, the floor gaped open. A vast hole yawned in the center, blacker than night. From it rose whispers. All female voices — young, old, every age, every accent. Some soft, some sharp, some that seemed centuries old. They beckoned, pulling me closer.

I floated at the edge. Peered down. Saw nothing but endless dark.

And then I saw her.

The woman. Not a girl. Not a shadow. Flesh and bone and terror. She wore a hospital gown, its hem dark with dried blood. Her long black hair whipped in a phantom wind. Her skin was gaunt, death-pale. She stared at me, eyes burning with the same unnatural intensity.

“Row 15,” she rasped. Her voice cracked, echoing, layered with a thousand tones. “Bottom row…”

I tried to answer, to scream, but I had no mouth. Only thought. Only dread pressing into me like deep water.

Then I woke. Shaking. Sweating. The faint glow of a streetlight bleeding through my window.

Her words lingered. *Row 15. Bottom row.*

I didn’t know what it meant. I didn’t know what she wanted. I only knew that sleep had betrayed me, my town held secrets darker than anyone dared admit, and for the first time in my life, I felt utterly, irrevocably… alone.

The morning after that dream, I wanted nothing more than to scrub it out of my memory. I clung to routine like a life raft. Wake up, dress in the same jeans I’d worn two days straight, choke down burnt toast, and ride my bike through the misty streets toward Blackwood High.

The air smelled of salt and tar from the pier, the kind of briny sharpness that clung to your clothes long after you’d come inside. Seagulls wheeled overhead, crying at one another, and the gray clouds never seemed to move. Blackwood always felt frozen, like a painting that refused to dry.

School looked like it always did: squat, box-shaped, bricks mottled with salt stains. The flag out front sagged heavily and limply, never flying, just hanging there like a reminder of something long past.

My friends were already waiting by the bike racks, kicking at gravel, huddled in the damp morning like a pack of strays. Vince was chewing sunflower seeds and spitting shells into the dirt. Tommy had his denim jacket on despite the heat. Ricky looked like he hadn’t slept at all — but that was just his face. He always looked tired, like he was born that way.

“Dude,” Vince said as soon as I rolled up, “my old man nearly skinned me alive. I’m on lockdown until graduation.”

“Graduation?” Tommy laughed, bumping him with an elbow. “Try ‘til Jesus comes back.’”

Ricky smirked. “At least you guys just got punished. My dad gave me the sermon. Hour-long lecture about responsibility, about being a man, about ‘honor.’ I’d rather he just beat me and get it over with.”

I shrugged, forcing my voice to sound casual. “Yeah. Same here. My old man… You know.”

They did know. I never had to explain. The subject dropped, like it always did.

The day rolled on in the dull rhythm of Blackwood High. Math, history, English — all taught in classrooms that smelled faintly of chalk and seawater. The paint on the walls peeled like sunburnt skin. The clocks ticked louder than the teachers spoke.

Tommy got caught doodling rocket ships again and had to stay after class. Vince nearly started a fight with a sophomore over a bent quarter for the soda machine. Ricky fell asleep in the study hall, head tipped back, mouth open like he’d given up on pretending. And me? I laughed at their jokes. I nodded along. I tried to be present.

But underneath it all, something was gnawing at the back of my mind.

It wasn’t a voice exactly. Not words. More like the feeling of being watched, or the pressure in your ears when you dive too deep. A hum at the edge of thought. And sometimes, when I wasn’t looking for it, the hum turned into a whisper. A direction. A pull.

Row 15. Bottom row.

I shook my head. Tried to focus on Vince’s story about sneaking into the theater to watch Return of the Jedi again. Tried to laugh at Tommy making fun of the new arcade machine at the rec center — “it’s like watching a brick jump, man!” Tried to sip the warm Coke from the cafeteria and let it fizz across my tongue.

But the compulsion was always there. A tug in the back of my skull, soft but constant. Like a hook in the water, pulling me closer, closer.

By the final bell, I was exhausted. Not just tired — worn down, like I’d been carrying bricks all day. The effort it took to push the thought back every time it surfaced left me heavy-limbed, head thick with fog.

I rode my bike home slowly, the tires crunching over gravel, my body on autopilot. When I finally staggered into the living room, the silence of the house wrapped around me. My father was gone — likely at the bar. For once, I was grateful.

I didn’t bother with homework. Didn’t bother with food. I just dropped onto the couch, my bag sliding to the floor. The cushions smelled faintly of beer and smoke, like everything else in that house.

The whisper still scratched at me, faint now, as though it knew I was resisting. But I pushed it down one last time. My body felt leaden. I closed my eyes.

And sleep swallowed me whole.

When I woke, it wasn’t in my living room.

It was dark. Too dark. The kind of dark that felt solid, pressing against your eyes even when they were open. For a moment, I thought I was still dreaming. My head throbbed, my limbs ached.

I sat up with a groan and hissed through my teeth. Stinging fire lit across my chest and arms. When I reached down, my fingers came away wet. Sticky. Warm. Blood.

Cold night air slid through broken glass somewhere above me, making the cuts sting worse. Moonlight bled in through a jagged window, a pale silver slash that cut across rows of shelves.

The smell hit me next: dust, mold, old paper.

The library.

I staggered to my feet, glass crunching under my shoes. My shirt clung to me, wet with blood. Cuts ran down my arms like I’d clawed through brambles. But I had no memory of coming here. No memory of breaking in.

And then, beneath the ringing in my ears, I heard it.

Not from outside. Not from inside. From everywhere.

Row 15. Bottom row.

The voice wasn’t louder this time. It was clearer.

And I knew, with the certainty of a nightmare you can’t shake, that I wasn’t leaving the library until I found it.

The library looked different at night. During the day it was a sad, aging building — yellowed windows, a leaky roof, the kind of place teachers forced you to visit for book reports. But now, in the wash of moonlight, it seemed older, almost ancient, like it had been here long before the town itself.

Shadows stretched across the carpet, long and warped. The air was damp, thick with the scent of salt and rot, as though the sea had crept in and settled among the shelves.

My shoes crunched over broken glass as I moved, every sound too loud, bouncing off the high ceiling. I didn’t dare breathe too heavy. My cuts stung with every step, warm blood soaking through my shirt.

And underneath it all, the whisper.

row 15… bottom row…

It wasn’t in my ears. It wasn’t in the room. It was inside me, vibrating in my ribs, threaded through my pulse. Every time I thought I could ignore it, it sharpened, pulling my thoughts back like a leash.

The shelves loomed around me, tall, endless. Numbers stenciled in faded white paint marked the ends of rows. My eyes darted from one to the next. Eleven… twelve… thirteen…

The deeper I went, the darker it got. The moonlight only reached so far. Past the tenth row, I had to move by memory and the faint outline of shelves against deeper black. The smell changed too — less like dust, more like… mildew. Like something damp had been sitting here for years, festering.

Row fourteen.

I froze. My breath hitched. For a moment, everything was silent.

Then a creak.

Wood shifting. Not behind me. Not ahead. Somewhere between. The sound of weight settling on old boards.

“Hello?” My voice was too small, swallowed by the stacks.

Silence.

I forced myself forward, my hand grazing the edge of the shelves to keep steady. My fingers brushed over the spines of books, stiff and sticky with damp, their titles unreadable in the dark.

And then — there it was.

Row fifteen.

My chest tightened. The whisper surged, flooding my head until it was all I could hear.

bottom row… bottom row… bottom row…

I knelt, my knees popping against the thin carpet. The bottom shelf sat half in shadow, the wood warped and soft from water damage. Most of the books there looked ruined — swollen, mold-eaten, their pages fused.

But one… one was different.

A thin black volume, its spine unmarked, wedged between two rotting dictionaries. It didn’t look wet. Didn’t look old. It looked new, like someone had placed it there just for me.

My hand trembled as I reached for it. The instant my fingertips brushed the cover, the air around me shifted. Colder. Heavier. The silence thickened until I could hear only my own heartbeat hammering.

I pulled the book free. The leather cover was slick, clammy, as though it had been pulled from water only moments ago. No title. No author. Just black.

And then, faint but undeniable, a sound.

Breathing.

Not mine.

Slow. Ragged. Coming from the other side of the shelf.

The book sat heavy in my hands, colder than it had any right to be. The leather cover stuck faintly to my palms, as though it were sweating. For a long moment, I just knelt there, crouched in the dark, listening to the breathing on the other side of the shelf.

Inhale.

Exhale.

A sound too steady to be an accident.

I squeezed my eyes shut, willing it away. It had to be in my head. Just the blood loss, the exhaustion, the dream still leaking into reality. When I opened my eyes again, the sound had stopped.

But the silence wasn’t any better.

My pulse thudded in my ears as I staggered to my feet. The book weighed down my arm like an anchor, pulling me back toward the shelf, but I refused to open it. Not yet. I shoved it under my arm and forced myself down the row, each step dragging.

The shelves towered over me like walls. My shoulder brushed them as I walked, and dust rained down in little cascades. The air was damp, heavy, and I swore it thickened the deeper I went.

At the end of the row, I turned sharply, moving toward the exit. My body screamed to get out. My mind screamed louder. Just leave. Toss the thing. Pretend it never happened. Forget.

But every step forward was harder than the last. My legs trembled. My cuts throbbed. It felt like I was walking against a current, like the library itself was holding me back.

I stopped, panting, gripping the book to my chest. The urge to throw it — to just hurl it into the dark and run — burned in me. My arm even twitched with the motion.

And then, faint as a sigh, the whisper returned.

…row 15… bottom row…

My stomach lurched. The voice wasn’t around me this time. It came from the book. Vibrating through the leather cover into my bones.

I dropped it.

The sound was louder than it should have been, a hollow thud that echoed through the stacks. Dust spiraled upward. My hands shook as though they’d touched something electric.

Silence followed. A long, suffocating silence.

And then — the breathing again. Closer now.

I spun around, heart hammering, but the row behind me was empty. Nothing but books and shadows. No footsteps, no movement. Just me.

My chest heaved. My cuts burned. My body screamed for the door, but my eyes… my eyes wouldn’t leave the book on the floor.

It lay there, black cover catching the thin blade of moonlight. Waiting.

I took a step toward it. Then another. My breath came ragged, shallow. Each step sounded too loud. The carpet muffled nothing.

Kneeling again, I reached out, fingers trembling. The leather was cold as ice when I touched it, colder than before.

My hand hovered over the edge of the cover. My body felt split in two — one half desperate to flee, the other compelled, dragged by invisible hooks.

And then the whisper returned, not faint this time, not soft.

OPEN IT.

The sound wasn’t outside. It was inside. Rattling through my skull, pressing against my teeth, vibrating down my spine.

I froze, paralyzed between terror and inevitability, staring at the unmarked cover, knowing that once I did, there would be no going back.

My thumb slipped under the cover, and for a heartbeat I swore the leather pulsed — not like dead hide, but like something still living. Still breathing. I almost tore my hand back, but the whisper hooked into me, pulling me down.

*Open it.*

The cover peeled back with a faint, wet crackle, like skin tearing from scabs.

The first page was blank. Yellowed, spotted with mold. I turned another. Blank again. My breath came short. Ten, twelve pages in — still empty.

Then the ink appeared.

Thin, black strokes spidered across the page in lines and curves too sharp, too fluid. They weren’t words, not in any language I knew. Not English, not Spanish, not even the Latin phrases priests sometimes muttered when they visited our school. These shapes bent in ways that made my eyes water. Some jagged as broken bones. Others coiled like worms gnawing through the paper itself.

I couldn’t read it, but I *understood* something all the same.

And that’s when the room shifted.

The air grew heavy, thick with pressure, like the deep ocean had folded itself around me. My ears popped. My vision warped, colors leeching until only black and white remained. My stomach clenched, a rope twisting my guts tighter and tighter.

Then the nausea hit.

My throat filled with rot. I gagged, slammed to my hands and knees, and vomited violently. What came up was thin, yellow sludge, steaming as it hit the carpet. It reeked of sulfur, a rancid egg-stink that clawed at my sinuses and made my eyes burn.

I kept retching long after my stomach emptied, each heave wracking my chest, until finally I collapsed, face sinking into the foul puddle.

The moment my cheek touched it, the darkness rushed in.

When I woke, I was in my bed.

Sunlight pressed against the curtains, pale and thin. My sheets clung damp to my skin. For a moment I thought I had dreamed it, that I’d never left my house, never opened the book.

Then I felt the weight in my hand.

I looked down.

The book lay against my chest, my fingers locked in a death-grip around its spine. The leather was slick and clammy, colder than the air. My knuckles ached as I pried them loose, one by one, until the thing thudded onto the sheets beside me.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

Across the fabric of my shirt, smeared over my chest and stomach, were black marks. Symbols. The same jagged curves and crooked hooks from the book’s pages, written in ink that hadn’t been there the night before. They shimmered faintly, as though wet, and when I leaned close, I could smell the same sulfur stink rising from them.

I tore the shirt off and hurled it across the room. It landed in a heap, but the marks didn’t fade. They seemed to pulse faintly in the sunlight, like embers that refused to die.

I pressed a hand to my bare chest. The skin underneath was hot, raw, as if the symbols had burned straight through the cloth into me.

The book sat perfectly still beside me, its cover blank, its spine unmarked.

But I knew — with a certainty that hollowed me out — that it had branded me. That whatever had whispered from its pages had seeped through my eyes, my veins, my bones.

And though the house was empty, though the morning air was still, I swear I could feel it.

Something breathing.

Not around me.

*Inside me.*

The next day stretched on like a dream folded wrong. Every hallway, every classroom, every locker-lined corridor felt thicker, heavier, as if the air itself had weight. I could feel it pressing down on my shoulders, tightening around my ribs.

The staring began immediately, subtle at first. I’d glance up from my notebook or lift my eyes in the hall, and nothing seemed unusual. A friend passing, a teacher at the board, a classmate laughing at a joke — normal. But the moment I looked away, the weight of awareness returned.

Eyes. Always eyes. Watching me when I wasn’t looking.

I could sense them in my peripheral vision, tracing me like invisible hands, waiting for me to turn my back. It didn’t matter where I was — the cafeteria, the gym hallway, even the stairwell. The sensation was omnipresent.

By lunch, my skin itched with awareness. I sat with Vince, Tommy, and Ricky, trying to focus on fries that tasted like chalk, pretending the buzzing in my skull wasn’t there. Their chatter felt distant, as if the world around me had become a thin film separating me from reality.

I laughed at a joke Vince made, but the sound didn’t match his mouth moving. I shook my head, trying to clear it.

Then I noticed something.

In the reflection of the metal water fountain near the gym, something moved behind me. I froze mid-step, throat tight. The warped silver surface showed… a face. Not Vince, not Tommy. Not human. Black eyes that filled the face, impossibly wide, with long gray hair spilling over shoulders too thin, and a smile stretched far beyond what any human mouth could hold. It was meant to be welcoming — warm — but every corner of it screamed wrong.

I snapped my attention around.

Vince was there, leaning lazily against the locker. Just Vince.

“Whoa, man! You okay?” he said, voice tight with concern. “You look… pale.”

I swallowed hard, fumbling for words. “Yeah. Fine. Just… tired, I guess.”

He didn’t look convinced. “You’re shaking. Seriously, something’s wrong.”

I forced a smile, messy and broken. “I’m fine. Really.”

But the world wasn’t fine.

Everywhere I went that afternoon, it was the same. The weight on my shoulders, the prickle at the back of my neck, the invisible stare. Even when friends were beside me, I felt the pull of unknown eyes digging into my back.

And then I heard it.

Not from anyone. Not from anywhere outside me.

*Nephilim.*

The word vibrated through my bones. I couldn’t localize it — not the room, not the lockers, not the ceiling. Just *inside*. The sound was impossible, resonant, like metal twisting under a black tide.

I gasped, my stomach tightening, and my vision blurred. For a heartbeat, the hallways stretched, the walls bending, lockers twisting, the faces around me elongating, hollowing, eyes widening beyond humanity. Even Vince, walking beside me, seemed to flicker, as if his skin was a thin mask over something older, something wrong.

I gripped the water fountain, letting the cold metal anchor me. My head spun. The word whispered again, not with sound, but with weight. *Nephilim.*

I blinked, and the world snapped back. The lockers were straight, the faces normal, Vince was laughing at some joke Tommy made, entirely oblivious to the terror pressing against my mind.

But I knew it hadn’t gone.

I knew it would follow.

All the eyes, all the watching, all the wrongness — it had a name now. *Nephilim.*

And I understood, deep in a way I was not ready to understand, that I could not hide from it.
