I don’t know who will believe me, but I need to record what happened.

So, first a bit of context. I'm a theologian, and I've been writing my essay on angelology (the study of angels). I want to make one thing clear: Those "biblically accurate angels" you see on TikTok and stuff are bs. Those are Ophanim, Seraphim, and Cherubim. Angels are Malakhim. The scholarly consensus is that angels would look like ordinary people, or maybe slightly glowing people, but that's it. 

This is important for later. 

So, anyway. I was researching lots of different interpretations, like Metatron and Yahoel, who act with the name of God and essentially are God. Then I got to Genesis, where it talks about God giving flaming swords to Cherubim to guard Eden. Well, I buried the lede. I found the garden of Eden. Sorry for not sharing that earlier. Anyway.

I’m still here. Somehow my phone works and isn’t running out of battery. The signal is strong, though there are no towers around me, just trees, and grass, and a horizon that bends too sharply, like I’m standing inside a dome.



The problem is, I’m not alone.



I can't prove it, but I swear something is out there. There’s a weird mixture of wildlife, I’ve seen Camels and Penguins drinking from the same source, and I’ve seen Gorillas sleeping with Coyotes. They all seem to co-exist, except for me. They’ve avoided me.



This place is hard to describe. It’s like a Jungle, Forest, Meadow and Plain all got together and had a baby. Giant mossy trees draped with vines reside right next to Oak trees with squirrels running up and down their trunks. But in the midst of it all, the first thing that I noticed was off, was a smell.



Have you ever burnt a cut you have, and smelt that strange mixture of the coppery-iron blood and smoke? It’s like that, but almost calming to smell. When I try to find it, I begin to taste it, but it’s different when I taste. Some kind of bird, maybe duck, mixed with every seasoning you can imagine, perfectly blended yet so contrasting.



But there’s another smell, somewhere to the east (I think, the sun rises and sets weirdly here). Did you know, we have discovered two incense altars that were discovered with the holy of holies of the Judahite temple at Arad, in the southern Negev. 

This temple was operating some time in the first temple period (10th-6th Century BCE) and was decommissioned or destroyed around the reign of Hezekiah (around 716 to 686 BCE) or the siege of Sennacherib (Around 701 BCE). These altars had burnt substances on them, and they were tested. The smaller of the two had three different compounds of Cannabis. All this to say, somewhere in that direction I can smell weed.



Now, I know what you’re thinking. “If you found your way in, you can find your way out! Just go back the way you came.” To which I say; No shit Sherlock, I’ve tried it. How I got here is complicated, and is a reason most of the academic world disregards me.



You see, Theologians and Biblical Scholars will generally try to exclude mysticism from their work, focusing on the textual evidence as it’s presented (For a good reference, try Dan McClellan. Love that man. Anyway). So when I say that I found an old manuscript that contained a very hard to decipher message containing directions to Eden through a spell, you can imagine I wasn’t going to say shit. To be honest, I didn’t even believe it when I did it, but I wanted to better understand the ritual. Maybe the mixture of incense and herbs would cause a hallucinogenic effect? 



So I figured I’d take one for the team. I drew the sigils, got the materials, and sang the prayers. Next thing I knew, I was standing before a great archway in a hedge. I walked into it, and then I got a shiver running down my spine. A small voice in the back of my head began screaming; “Don’t turn around.”



Then I heard the roar of a lion. It’s nothing like the movies led you to believe. It’s somehow less scary, yet infinitely more terrifying. It came from right behind me. That’s when I also started hearing the beating of giant wings, feeling the wind blasted against my back, almost knocking me off my balance. Then the bellowing of an Ox vibrated across the ground and up my legs. Finally, I heard a voice. Like bronze dragging across piano wire. A painful, haunting beautiful melody.

*“Al tira”*

For anyone reading this that doesn’t speak Hebrew, that’s “Be not afraid”. And let me tell you; it made me so much more afraid. I ran as fast as I could. I could feel heat rising behind me, like a fire with too much newspaper thrown in. As I ran, the voice pounded in my skull.

*“Pen yishlach yado velakach gam me'etz hachayyim ve'achal vachai le'olam”*

“Lest he stretch forth his hand, and take even from the tree of life, and eat, and live without end.”

Genesis 3:22b. It was at that moment I understood where I was, and what I heard and felt.



Remember how I said “Biblically accurate Angels” is bullshit? Well, let me provide you a little something.

>Genesis 3:24, NIV

>“After \[God\] drove the man out, \[God\] placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.”



>Ezekiel 1:5-6,10, Ezekiel 10:15, NIV

>“In the fire was what looked like four living creatures. In appearance their form was human, but each of them had four faces and four wings. | Their faces looked like this: Each of the four had the face of a human being, and on the right side each had the face of a lion, and on the left the face of an ox; each also had the face of an eagle | Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River.”

When I realised, that’s when I also realised how fucked I am. I can’t go back the way I came because I ran too far and didn’t pay attention. I’d like to see you remember the way back when running from a divine being!



Now, I’m in a small area. It’s calm (relatively speaking). There is no Cherub chasing me anymore, but the land itself is weird. I’m sitting by a stream, the water is clear, but it has a greenish-purple hue to it. Along its bank is enough gemstones to set me and the rest of my family tree up for generations, pure gold is scattered like vines along the bed of the stream, and it's shallow enough to reach. 



The water itself is weird too. It tastes like water does, you know that distinct “has no flavour” flavour? But there's something more to it. It’s the most refreshing drink I’ve ever had, one sip and I feel like I don’t need more. It also had a weird aftertaste, like that taste you get after bleeding in your mouth, mixed with chocolate. You’d think it's disgusting, but it weirdly isn’t, it’s almost calming. I luckily had a bag with some blank papers in it, so I’m of course also noting all this down. If I somehow make it out of here, I’ll have to share these findings with others.



Anyway, I’m tired, and I’m getting hungry. I hope I can make it through the night to see what comes next. If not, then I guess I’ll die knowing that God is fucking real, and that my research was right.
