My name is Francis Holman but my friends call me Frankie. 

I live in a small town in Pennsylvania called Easthallow. 
With a population over 3000 people it is truly a small and rural place. 
But it's my hometown, it's were I grew up and all my family and friends are here 

They're also the reason why I'm typing this right now. 
It's currently 2:00 am and I'm sitting here at my desk in front of my computer. 

I should be sleeping since I have school tomorrow but I can't. 
I can't cause ever since school started i have noticed some slight changes about some of the students in my school. 

What I'm about to tell you is gonna sound crazy and most of you people might be thinking that I'm either high or just a kid with a vivid imagination.

But I swear, this shit is real. 

It started last week on the first day of my sophomore year. 
After the holidays, my two best friends Donnie and Tim and I were so excited to see eachother again. 

Donnie had to spent all summer at his 
aunts farm somewhere in Delaware, doing hard farm work after this parents got mad at him for crashing his dad's car into their fence

To our surprise his dad, who is a very strict veteran who served God knows where, didn't give him a beating this time. 

Tim and I spent the little time we had together, smoking pot from his brothers stash and playing videogames all night, until Tim and his family went out of town for the holidays. 

So for the most part, I was alone. 
I don't really have that many friends, Donnie and Tim are my only ones. 
My sister Stephanie mocks me because of that. 

She is the complete opposite of me.
She's very popular in my school and has a lot of friends. 
During the holidays she would go to a lotta parties or spend her time with her boyfriend Henry. 

I hate that guy. 
He's pretty much an asshole and a bully on top of that. 
But yeah, hanging out with my sister during the holidays wasn't even an option. 

Anyways, holidays were over and we were excited to leave the freshman year behind us and start of as sophomores.

The first few days went on pretty fast, you know how it is. 
School hasn't really started yet, it all kinda needs to settle in. 

"Enjoy it while you can" said Tim 
"Yeah man, we don't gotta hit the books yet but once that starts, we can forget about doing this Frankie" replied Donnie with a slight cough as he passed the joint to me.

And this is what we would do the first few days. 
We would hang out at some old playground in the evening, smoke weed and talk about all kinds of stuff

Until one day Donnie shared something with us that happened in school.

"Guys you ain't gonna believe what i saw in P.E today" 
"What?" asked Tim
"You guys know Nathan Boyles, the scrawny kid with the curly hair? While we changed our clothes for P.E, I glanced over at him and you won't believe what I saw"
"You checking guys out now? I'm not even surprised" said Tim and we both laughed
 
"Fuck off" said Donnie, holding his middle finger up
"Alright relax man what did you see?" I asked 
"Dude I swear, when he took his pants off I saw that he was wearing panties. Pink panties man!"

Tim and I didn't know how to react. Donnie is a lot of things. Some say he's reckless others might say he's just plain dumb.
But a liar? Never, that's the last thing you gonna hear outta his mouth

But still, it kinda was a mix of humor and shock at the same time hearing this. 
You need to understand, our town is very conservative like most small towns are and heavily Christian on top of that.

"And the other ones didn't say anything?" I asked 
"He was lucky that we were the last ones in the locker room. The other guys would bully him till senior year" said Donnie 
"Does that mean he's Gay?" asked Tim 
"Wait, wasn't he dating Kenzie Thompson last year? I asked confused
"Maybe he changed his mind? I mean shit I don't know. Gay or not, he definitely wore panties" said Donnie 

For the rest of the evening we moved to a lotta other topics. 
By the time I was home, I already forgot about it. 
But that wouldn't last long.

It was the next day during lunch break when we noticed some even more weird shit in our school 

We sat at the table, eating our food and talking about our day until Tim noticed something.

"Yo guys check Norton out over there" said Tim pointing at Nick Norton's direction with his spoon 

Donnie and I turned our heads but we didn't notice anything, he was just eating his food and talking to some girls. 

"What about him?" I asked 
"Look at his hands" said Tim whispering 

And this is when we noticed it. 
Nick had painted fingernails in various colors

"Huh, that's somet-" but before I could finish my sentence, Donnie interrupted me because he noticed something else 

"Why the fuck are Kenzie and Jason making out while Nathan is sitting next to her?" 

We all looked at eachother in confusion. Not knowing what is going on with our schoolmates. 

Donnie got up and walked over to Nathan. 
Tim and I couldn't stop him.
If something struck Donnie's curiosity, then he gotta investigate. That's just how it is. 

I couldn't really hear anything as they were a bit further away. 
But suddenly jason got up from his seat and said very loudly
"Mind your own business punk" 

Jason Lynne is one year above us. 
He was already quite big last year but apparently he got even taller over the holidays.

I got up from my seat now and walked over to Donnie. 
"Hey man, come on just leave it" 
"Yeah listen to your girlfriend Donald" said Jason

Donnie, while pissed off, was smart enough to let it go.
We went to our seats and ate our lunch in silence.
Puzzled about the whole situation. 

The whole day we all couldn't focus in class, always noticing something weird. 
Even after school, we didn't even went to our usual spot. We just went home. 

As i got home I threw my backpack on the floor and fell into my bed. 
I laid there for a couple of minutes, thinking about the events of today

I eventually got up and went downstairs to get myself something to drink when I passed by Stephanies bedroom door.
Usually I don't really talk to her often, since we don't get along that much. 
But i thought I could maybe ask her about this stuff, since she's older. 

I opened her door but my sister wasn't in her room 
This was when I found something on her desk.
On her desk were test tubes containing a pink liquid
It was a light pink.
I shook it lightly and small bubbles would emerge

"Huh, must be something for chemistry class" 
I thought to myself

As I was about to leave her room, I saw a book on her bedside table. It looked pretty old. Bound in leather that was red and faded. 
The title was: Sissification 101

I randomly opened up a page and what I saw left me even more confused and somewhat disturbed.
The page I opened contained illustrations of men pleasing other men while a woman was watching.

Inspecting the illustrations closer I noticed that one man is more feminine dressed and drawn while the other seems to be more masculine. 
The woman seems to be smirking and enjoys the view.

Next to the illustration was written: 

"With the help of the right chemicals, men can easily be turned into sissies to please you and your partner"

I looked back at the vials then back at the book and I realized that my sister isn't preparing something for chemistry class.
But before I could finish the rest of the paragraph I heard the door knob turn. 

I closed the book and let it fall back on the nightstand before facing the door

"What are you doing in my room dork!" Shouted my sister 

I had to think fast
"Sorry I was looking for a charger for my phone, mine is broken" I said with the best acting skills I could pull out my ass 
"Well I don't got one, get out Francis!"
"Alright, geez" I said leaving her room. 

She slammed the door behind her and I let out a sigh of relief. 
I immediately went to my room and called Donnie and Tim up to meet me at the playground. 

We met up at our spot. Tim and Donnie got up from the old swings with the rusty chains as I was making my way up to them. 

"What's wrong Frankie, you sounded pretty frantic on the phone" said Tim with a sign of concern in his voice. 
"Guys, I think we know that what we saw in school today wasn't normal" I said. 
Tim and Donnie nodded approvingly 
"This is gonna sound crazy and most likely paranoid but I think I know what's up" 

"What do you mean" asked Tim confused
"What if I told you that the guys in our school aren't doing all of this consensual. I think they are brainwashed" 
They both started to laugh 
"Dude, are you high right now? If so, fuck you for not sharing" said Donnie 

"Fuck off I'm not high and you know I wouldn't smoke alone. I can barely keep it up with you two" I said. 
"But wait, why do you think they got brainwashed or more importantly how did it happen?" asked Tim in a serious tone. 

Tim is pretty much the brain in our trio. He's smarter than me and Donnie combined.
He never had a problem with his grades and he helped us a lotta times with homework. 

"Well I found some vials in my sisters room that looked pretty suspicious. And then there was this book about how to use chemicals to turn guys into sissies" 
"Sissies? You mean like dudes who act all feminine and obedient?" asked Donnie. 
I nodded. 

"So wait, you think your sister is behind all of this?" asked Tim 
"Can't say for sure. Who knows maybe all the girls are behind it? Remember how Kenzie and Jason were eating eachothers face off while Nathan just sat there watching it? Why would he do that?"  

"Who knows maybe they both stayed friends and she's dating Jason now?" said Donnie
"Oh okay, but why the fuck would he just sit and watch them? I mean come on you know it's weird Donnie" I said. 
"He's got a point, but this whole thing about brainwashing and vials and books? Eh, don't you think it's too much Frankie?" said Tim. 

"Well but-" but before I could finish my sentence Tim cut me off. 
"Nah man, just leave it. I mean come one dude, you know it sounds crazy. Your sister is probably just preparing something for chemistry" said Tim. 
"But what about the book?" I asked.
"Dude she's a girl, who knows what they read these days?" said Donnie smirking

"Shit guys you probably right. I must have read too much into it". I said embarrassed.
"Nah it's cool Frankie. It's a new semester man, people change and shit" said Donnie. 
He put his hand on my shoulder and gave me a reassuring smile which put my mind at ease

"Now Frankie, where's the weed?" asked Donnie 
"Oh fuck off with that" I said and laughed. 

After we spend some more time talking and laughing, I pretty much forgot about all that. 

Until I got home. 

As I was walking up the stairs on my way to my room, I saw that my door was open. 
My walk began to slow down and i got more anxious with every step I made. 
I walked into my room only to find my sister sitting at my desk.
It was dark and the only light source was from my desktop. 
On the desk a charger and two red Styrofoam cups. 

"Steph?" I said puzzled

"Oh there you are, I was waiting here for you. Had fun with your friends?" 

"Uhh yeah. Why were you waiting for me?" 

"Well you see, I feel kinda bad for shouting at you today. I mean you just asked me for a charger and I was pretty much a bitch about it"

"Oh uhm yeah, I mean no, it's okay though"

"Well to make it up to you I got you a new charger since yours is broken and a little surprise"

"Thanks Steph, what's the surprise?" I asked slightly anxiously 

"Since you are in sophomore now and I'm now a senior, how about a drink?' 

"A drink?"

She got up from my chair and walked over to me with the two cups in her hands. 
She handed me one and told me to drink it all at once. 
"Bottoms up" she said 
We both drank up. The taste had a small hint of alcohol but at the same time something salty and slightly metallic. 

"Well its late and I'm kinda tired. Let's talk tomorrow, alright?"

I stood there frozen and just nodded. 
She gave me one last look before heading out and closing my door. 

I immediately spat the liquid back into the cup.
The taste was still there and my tongue started to burn a bit. 
Never in my whole life has my sister acted this nice to me, not even when I was younger. 
I know something was up. 

I turned on the lights and examined the cup

Something that I immediately noticed was the color of the liquid. Pink. 
My body froze up and I felt a cold shiver going down my spine. 
Upon examining the cup further, I noticed it had a small blue dot on it. 

She must have marked it so she wouldn't switch them up. 
I went to my backpack and grabbed a empty water bottle. 
I poured the liquid carefully into it. If i was correct about everything I've told my friends, than I gotta have a sample of the liquid on my own. 

Although I hope that my saliva won't have such a deep impact on it. 

This whole thing is still scaring me. I cannot sleep knowing what my sister has planned. 
As I'm typing this right now, I can see the sun rising.

I don't know what to do, but what I know is, I gotta stop it before it gets outta control.

My name is Franics Holman and this is my fight against the Sissification Project
