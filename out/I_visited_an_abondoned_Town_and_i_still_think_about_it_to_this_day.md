Last year, I went to my brothers baseball tournament for a weekend. It was in Georgetown Delaware, and it was called Sports at the beach.

 I personally don't enjoy baseball. My friend(Sarah) who also had a brother on the team always goes on walks with me during the games. Sarah asked if we could go explore asince we had never been here before. 

We were walking towards were the fields ended. The path was still going. We saw a abandoned park, of course we decided to go check it out. i'm on the rusty monkey bars and looking around my friend wanders off. She comes back to me screaming to look what she found.

 I walk over, there's a big what looks to be an abondend town. If you want to know what it looks like, Google "Delaware Georgetown Screams at the beach". We walked in and was going through every "shack" (that was stupid) we walk in one and right at the front of the door opening there was a bear trap. I could have gotten my leg cut off. It was so dirty in there. Bugs, unknown liquid, food trash, clothes?? 

but what shocked me was a cage. why was there a cage?? We got a little scared but decided to brush it off and continue on. We open the next door. There is a lock. We somehow got it open because it seems to be very old. 

Anyways, we walked in and the floor boards were so old they almost broke. We saw what looked to be were someone was living. A collection of clothes, and food wrappers. We got scared that maybe someone was living here and tried to walk out. 

In the middle of the "town" as you can see in the picture, there was a little house. It wasn't until we walked past it that we realized that it had a camera and it was blinking red. We knew we needed to get out. 

Two guys our age popped out of no where trying to " scare" us. That scared the shit out of me. We talked to them about it and left shortly after.

 A guy that worked in the sports at the beach place saw us trying to hop down the fence from the park. He ran over to us and told us to never go over there again. He (without us giving him any description) told us his friends and him went over there and his friend got his leg cut off in a bear trap. me and my sarah just looked at eachother and told him we wouldn't go in there.

 Today i was thinking about it. i decided to do some reasearch. It seems to be a abandoned scare park. It was called "Screams by the beach" There isn't much information about it. I reccomend you look it up. I have found some intreasring things on there facebook too. If you know anything or find anything about this place please let me know, it still creeps me out to this day!
