Since I was a boy, I’ve moved around a lot. It’s because of my work. 

I'm a preacher. I go from town to town to spread the word as far as I can. I love my work, and I wouldn’t change it.

But I sometimes do miss the small town I grew up in. To be honest, it was so small I’m not even sure it qualified as a town. 

In a place like this, you feel like the world is leaving you behind. Like you’re frozen in time as everything happens around you.

But there are a lot of good things about it that I feel get overlooked. I’ve never felt a sense of belonging like I did in my home town. Everyone knew each other, and everyone was a friend. We had a sense of love and community that made life so much more colorful and beautiful.

We worked, celebrated, grieved, and endured together as one people. In the good times and in the bad.

We didn't have many of the things we do now, especially in a town like that. But we never felt that we needed them anyway. 

We walked to school and to church, and we entertained ourselves with endless adventures in the wilderness. 

But nowhere is without its dangers. And my home was not an exception.

Most families here were very religious. And with that, most of them were very superstitious. The dead were never to be disrespected. And spirits were feared. 

I grew up on ghost stories of La Llorona’s cries and El Silbón’s whistles. 

But it wasn’t like horror movies. We didn’t live in constant dread of oppressive demons and monsters. We treated them as part of the land.

Parents would warn their children of spirits the same way they warned us about wild animals or storms. A danger, yes - but not always a fear.

Still, my parents didn’t take risks with me. I was an only child and, looking back, I can see that both of my parents lived to ensure my future. 

It was a long walk to school from my house - about an hour and a half one way. But my father would wake up early to go with me to make sure I was safe. We left before the sun was up, and those talks we shared under the desert stars were some of the best times of my life.

But one morning sticks out to me in my memories among the rest. Like a crooked piece of paper in an otherwise neat filing cabinet. 

It was dark that morning, clouds obscured the heavens and filled them with thick ink. The desert seemed quieter too. No yipping coyotes or cooing owls. 

Still the trip was not abnormal otherwise. Until about halfway through, at least.

We walked along the dirt road as we always did, our boots crunching in the dust as we talked about anything and everything. I was always full of questions - mostly about our faith. I was always interested in the spiritual. Even as a boy. 

I wondered about what any child would wonder about: “Do dogs go to Heaven?” “If angels have wings, why don’t we ever find feathers?” “If I pray really quietly, does He have to lean in to hear me?” My dad answered them all with patience I worry I may never have. 

Our conversation was interrupted by footsteps. 

They were quiet at first, but rhythmic, almost like a march. Crunching, scraping steps from the other side of the road. Coming from the direction of the town towards where we had started.

They were quiet at first, but rhythmic, almost like a march. Crunching, scraping steps from the other side of the road, moving steadily toward us from the direction of the town.
Then I saw them - a group of maybe ten people, dressed in baggy work clothes. Most wore wide-brimmed hats that shadowed their faces, and none of their gazes turned from straight ahead. Their steps never faltered, not even on the loose stones.

I raised my hand to wave, but my father caught my wrist before I could. His grip was tight, harder than I had ever felt from him before.

I turned to him with a confused expression that he read even in the dim light of dawn. He answered my question before I even asked it,
“I don’t recognize those people. They’re not from here.”

I wanted to protest. We had always been welcoming of outsiders before. My parents had even hosted a few needy foreigners in the spare bedroom. I knew my father was wiser than me, but I wanted to point out to him that ignoring foreigners was not what the Bible said to do.

But he dragged me down the road by the wrist until the crunching of their boots had faded.
At that point, my father got to one knee to meet my eyes. I seldom saw such intensity on his face. He spoke quietly, yet his tone was as hard as iron, and it left no room for debate,

“In a town like ours, everyone knows everyone. Those people… I didn’t know a single face. Tell me, son, what business would strangers have walking toward nothing in the dark of morning?”

His words confused me, but he bypassed this with a simple command he knew I could follow.

“If a stranger like that ever talks to you, never answer. Don’t even look at them. Just keep walking. Understand?”

I swallowed my defiance and nodded. My father stood, and we kept walking. But even now, all these years later, I can still hear the crunch of those boots behind us, steady and unbroken, as if they never stopped walking that road. It wouldn’t be the last time I heard them.

Years went by. I was around 12 at this point. But, like I said earlier, time stands still in places like this. My routine was the same. I got up, walked to school, walked home after, and did chores. It was normal for kids my age to walk to school alone. But my father was still a protective man and usually went with me.

But this morning he had fallen ill. He was the kind of man who worked through fevers without complaint. So when he said he needed to rest, my mother and I didn’t question him.
He was so pale, and I had never seen him look so weak. Normally, he was like an immovable foundation. But lying in that bed, he seemed fragile. It was an alien feeling to see him vulnerable.

Before I left, my mother put my lunch in my bag and handed it to me. She took off her necklace - a thin golden cross that her mother gave to her - and put it around my neck. This, other than my dad being sick, was the only change in my morning routine.

She said a quick prayer over me, kissed my head, and sent me off to school like she always did. 

I stepped out into the cold desert morning air. It bit at my cheeks and ears. It was a beautiful morning, and the silence of the desert was almost spiritual. I walked silently. Not out of fear. Rather, I did not want to disturb the peacefulness I was walking through.

The moon was still up, a crescent of light guiding my way in tandem with a billion glittering diamonds. 

That morning, I kept my questions to myself, saving the more urgent ones for my dad.
I was so deep in thought that I didn’t notice the first few scraping steps behind me. By the time I did, they had already fallen into rhythm with my own. 

By the time I did notice, they were already in view. A group of what looked like laborers, walking to nowhere in the dark hours of morning. By the time I remembered my father’s words, “Don’t even look at them,” it was too late. I had been practically gawking at the leader of the shuffling crowd.

I saw his head pivot, the brim of his hat turning to meet my gaze. I looked away as fast as I could, but I saw. For the smallest fraction of a second, our eyes met. And that was enough.

My father’s words echoed in my head: Don’t even look at them.

But then it came — a sound worse than their march.

Silence.

Every boot had stopped at the exact same instant, scraping dust one last time before falling still. The desert air felt suddenly heavy, the way it does before a storm. I didn’t dare look, but I could feel them. Dozens of eyes pressing against the back of my neck.
I kept walking. I prayed under my breath that they would just keep walking. That they'd leave me alone. 

They did keep walking. Slowly, and in the wrong direction. 

Every crunch of my boots was answered by theirs, as if we were reflections walking side by side, separated by a river of gravel. I didn’t look, but I felt them there - ten figures in perfect step, only a few feet away.

That’s when I heard the first voice.

“Hey. Come over here. I need to show you something.”

I forced my eyes to stay where they were. And I walked faster. Then another voice,

“I need help. Please help me.”

Yet a third,

“Im lost. Can you give me directions?”

And then a choir. Of questions. Of begging. Of demanding.

“Your father told me to come get you.”

“Don't you remember me?”

“I found something shiny. It’s yours if you want it.”

I ignored them. I walked faster. They matched my pace. Their voices picked up intensity, snowballing into anger, despair, pleading, screaming and wailing.

“I'm hurt! You can't leave me like this!”

“I know where your house is. If you don't come here, I'll go kill your Mamma.”

“STOP! LOOK AT ME! COME HERE!”

Beginning with the desperation of a dying man, weeping like a widow, screaming with rage, yelling with fury. It was unbearable.
But still my eyes stayed down. I clutched at my mother's cross, praying softly that they would just leave me alone. That they would just leave me alone. 

It went on this way for another mile, until I reached the city.

The moment dirt gave way to tar, they fell silent. Every voice stopped mid-word.
As one, they turned, shuffled back the way they had come, their boots scraping gravel in perfect rhythm. Not one of them looked at me. Not one of them stumbled.

It was as if I had never been there at all. 

And the desert was silent again. 

I never took off that cross again. 

I saw them again. Many times until I moved out of my parents house.

But never again did I look at them, never again was I tempted to speak to them. I kept my eyes forward and walked. And they did the same. 

I don't know what would have happened had I listened to their demands. Nor do I know what unreachable destination they're walking to. 

But I do know that my father's words should be abided by.

If you ever see faces you don't recognize, just keep walking.
