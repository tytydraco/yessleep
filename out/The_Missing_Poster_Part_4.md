I didn’t drive straight to the station. I went back to the hotel.

My sister opened the door before I could knock. Her face was pale, eyes sunken from another sleepless night.

“Where were you?” she asked.

“I just needed to clear my head.”

She searched my face. “You look like hell.”

“I’ve had worse shifts.”

She tried to smile, but it broke halfway through. “I keep thinking maybe she’ll call” she said. “Like this is all some mistake.”

I forced myself to meet her eyes. “We’re going to find her. I promise.”

She nodded, but I could tell she didn’t believe me. “I keep replaying that morning” she whispered. “What I could’ve done different.”

“Don’t do that,” I said. “You’ll drive yourself crazy.”

“You’re one to talk.”

She was right.

I stayed until she finally laid down, exhaustion winning over fear once again. I watched her breathing even out before I slipped out again.

I parked two blocks away and sat in the car with the engine off. My phone sat in my lap like a live grenade. I wasn’t supposed to call anyone. I wasn’t supposed to do anything. But I couldn’t just wait for him to call.

If he said “the others” then there had to be others.

I drove to the precinct, let myself in through the side entrance, and pulled every missing person report I could find that matched my niece’s age bracket. No one was watching, the desk officer was half asleep.

I sat in the dark with the blue glow of the screen washing over me.

Names, faces, addresses. Most were runaways, custody disputes, tragic but explainable.

But a few… felt wrong. Clean houses. Quiet neighborhoods. Parents who described the same eerie calm.

“Nothing seemed out of place.”
“It looked like she’d just gone to school.”
“The bed was made.”

The phrase kept repeating across different reports like background noise I hadn’t noticed before. Not enough to build a case. Just enough to itch under the skin.

One detective had even written, no signs of struggle, room unusually tidy.

Unusually tidy.

I leaned back in the chair. If I said anything, if I pointed this out, it would sound like pattern chasing. Like paranoia. But I knew what I was looking at.

He wasn’t picking victims. He was picking environments.

Perfect homes. Perfect kids.

He’d been doing this for a while, quietly, carefully. Long enough that the evidence looked like coincidence.

I copied what I could onto a flash drive and pocketed it. When I left the building, the night air hit cold and sharp. The streets were empty.

For a second I thought about going back to the hotel, but the thought of seeing my sister’s face again, of having to lie, it made my stomach twist.

So I sat in the car instead, the reports flickering in my head.

The dashboard clock read 2:43 a.m. when the phone buzzed. Blocked number.

I didn’t answer at first. I just watched it light up, once, twice, three times. On the fourth, I picked up.

“You’re working late” Mark said.

My stomach went cold. “How do you know that?”

“You drive like someone looking for a reason not to go home.”
He paused, almost amused. “Did you find them? The others?”

I said nothing.

“I figured you might” he continued. “You’re a good officer. A practiced one. That’s what I like about you. You believe repetition makes things safe. You do something enough times, you start to think it’ll protect you.”

My throat felt tight. “What do you want?”

“To teach” he said simply. “Perfection begins with practice.”

The line stayed quiet for a beat. I could hear faint movement on his end, something brushing against fabric, then the soft click of a switch.

“You practice every day” he said. “Routine. Coffee. Uniform. You think that makes you strong. But repetition is just another way of hiding fear. So tonight, we will practice something new.”

“I’m not playing your game.”

“You already are” he said. “You’ve been playing since the day you met me. Tonight, go home. Don’t look for me. Don’t call anyone. Just keep practicing what you do best, pretending everything’s fine.”

The call ended.

I sat there, staring at my reflection in the windshield. My pulse was still hammering in my ears.

Practice. The word crawled under my skin.

The phone buzzed again at 4:17 a.m. Blocked number.

I almost didn’t answer. Part of me hoped if I ignored it, it would stop. But it didn’t.

I picked up. “Where is she?”

Mark’s voice came through soft, steady. “You sound tired.”

“Tell me where she is.”

“You’ve been asking all the wrong questions” he said. “That’s what happens when people don’t understand the lesson.”

I rubbed a hand over my face, trying to steady my breathing. “What lesson?”

He let the silence hang long enough for me to hear how calm he was.
“Perfection takes practice” he said finally. “And what better place to practice than where she learned what perfect looked like?”

The words just hung there between us.

For a few seconds, I didn’t move. I didn’t even understand.
She never cared about perfection, her room was always a wreck.
That was half the joke between us. I used to step over piles of clothes and tell her it looked like her closet exploded. She’d laugh and say it was creative.

But that night, when she went missing, her room had been spotless.
Too spotless.

My chest tightened.

He wasn’t talking about some memory. He was talking about now.

I swallowed hard. “Mark…”

“She’s improving” he said softly. “You should be proud. I think she finally understands what I’m trying to show her.”

The line clicked.

For a long time I just sat there, the phone still in my hand. The air inside the car felt heavier, like the oxygen had thinned.
I wanted to believe he was bluffing. That maybe he meant something else.
But the words kept replaying. Where she learned what perfect looked like.

Her room.

That perfect room.

He was there.

By the time I started the car, my hands were shaking so bad I nearly dropped the keys.

I was halfway to the house when the phone lit up. My sister.

“Hey…”

She cut me off before I could say anything. Her voice was frantic, high, trembling.
“I just talked to her!”

I gripped the wheel tighter. “What?”

“I talked to her. She called me. I swear to God she called me.”

My pulse slammed in my ears. “Slow down. Tell me what happened.”

“She was whispering” she said, her words tripping over each other. “I could barely hear her. I kept saying her name, and then… then I heard him.”

My stomach turned. “You’re sure?”

“It was him. The man who took her.” She was crying now, breath catching between every word. “He told her to say something. Like it was a game.”

I swallowed hard. “What did she say?”

There was silence on the line except for her breathing. Then she whispered,
“She said, ‘Mommy, he wants me to tell you… perfection takes pain.’”

I slammed the brakes, the car jerking sideways on the empty road.

“What?”

“That’s what she said. And then she screamed. And then” her voice broke. “And the call just… just ended.”

I pressed the phone tight to my ear, but there was nothing left. No sound.

“Stay in the room,” I said. My voice came out lower, steadier than I felt. “Lock the door and don’t move. Do you understand me?”

She tried to speak, but I hung up before she could argue.

The road stretched out in front of me, black and endless.
My hands wouldn’t stop shaking, but I pressed down on the gas anyway.

Tires screeched as I pulled into the driveway.
I barely threw the car into park before I was out, gun in hand.

The front door was unlocked. I pushed it open and moved room to room. Slow, methodical, every corner cleared, every shadow checked.

The house was silent.

The only light came from the crack beneath my niece’s bedroom door. A faint, steady glow that painted a thin line across the hallway floor.

I raised my weapon and turned the handle slowly.

She was there.
Curled up on the floor beside her bed, shaking but unharmed. Her eyes found mine and she started to sob.

I holstered my gun and dropped to my knees. “Hey, hey, it’s okay. You’re safe now. I’ve got you.”

She couldn’t get the words out, just nods, gasps, and the sound of her breathing against my chest.

“He told me if I got up he would’ve killed you!”

“It’s okay you don’t have to worry now!”

Silence filling the air as we embraced.

Then a noise broke the quiet.
Mechanical, familiar.

The printer.

It sat on the desk across the room, light blinking. A fresh sheet slid out, face down.

I stood up and walked over, my pulse hammering in my ears.

When I flipped the page over, my stomach turned to ice.

It was a photo of the hotel. My sister’s hotel room door.
Across it, in thick red letters:
PERFECTION TAKES PAIN.


I called the precinct on the way.
My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone steady.

“Yeah, it’s me,” I said. “I found my niece. She’s alive. I need units at the hotel we were staying at right now.”

They started asking questions I didn’t have answers for.
“He’s there” I said. “He went after my sister. Just get there. Please.”

My niece sat in the passenger seat beside me, small and silent.
Her hands clutched her stuffed rabbit like it was part of her. She hadn’t spoken since I found her.

The drive felt endless. Every red light looked the same color as the ink on that note.
Perfection takes pain.
Over and over until the words stopped sounding human.

When I turned into the parking lot, I saw the light from our room still on. 

I parked hard and got out, my niece right behind me.
The door was cracked open.

The smell hit before I even stepped inside.
Metal. Copper. Something heavy in the air.

I told my niece to stay close. She gripped the back of my jacket.

The bed was made.
The lamp was still on.
Everything was perfect.

I cleared the corners, the bathroom, the closet.
Nothing.

Then I saw it.

On the wall above the bed. Long, careful strokes of red.
Not splattered. Not rushed.
Written with precision.

Perfection takes pain.

My chest locked up.
I said her name once.
No answer.

My niece started crying behind me, soft and uneven.
I didn’t turn around.
I couldn’t.

There wasn’t blood everywhere.
Just enough to write.
Just enough to know she hadn’t left on her own.

I stood there for a long time, staring at that word.
The edges of each letter glistened in the light.

And that’s when I realized he wasn’t teaching her.
He was teaching me.
