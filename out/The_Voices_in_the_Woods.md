There’s a stretch of forest near my house that everyone in town avoids. It’s not marked on any maps, and there are no trails leading into it. The trees are thick and gnarled, their branches twisting together to form a canopy that blocks out the sun. The locals call it “Whispering Woods,” and they say that if you wander in there at night, you’ll hear voices—voices that know your deepest fears and darkest secrets. As a kid, I was warned to stay away, but the stories only made me more curious.

Last week, after a few drinks with friends, I decided to finally see if the stories were true. The moon was full, casting an eerie glow over the landscape as I made my way into the woods. The deeper I went, the quieter everything became. The usual sounds of the forest—crickets chirping, leaves rustling—faded away, leaving only the sound of my own footsteps. I started to feel uneasy, but I pushed on, determined to prove that there was nothing to be afraid of.

Then, I heard it. At first, it was just a faint whisper, barely audible over the sound of my own breathing. But as I ventured deeper, the whispers grew louder, more distinct. They were coming from all around me, from the trees themselves. My heart pounded in my chest as I tried to make out the words. They were familiar, yet strange, like something I had heard before but couldn’t quite place. Then, the voices began to take on the tone of people I knew—my mother, my best friend, even my own voice.

“You’ll never be good enough,” my mother’s voice said, filled with disappointment. “Everyone you love will leave you,” my best friend’s voice added, cold and distant. “You’re alone, and no one cares,” my own voice whispered, filled with despair. The words cut deep, striking at fears I didn’t even know I had. I tried to shake them off, to convince myself that it was all in my head, but the voices wouldn’t stop. They grew louder and more insistent, overlapping each other until they became a cacophony of torment.

Panic set in, and I turned to leave, but the forest seemed to close in around me. The trees twisted and shifted, blocking my path. The voices followed me, taunting me, filling my head with doubts and fears. I started to run, branches clawing at my skin as I stumbled through the undergrowth. The whispers became screams, echoing in my mind, driving me to the brink of madness. Just when I thought I couldn’t take it anymore, I burst out of the woods, collapsing onto the ground.

The voices stopped as suddenly as they had started. I lay there, gasping for breath, my body trembling with fear. When I finally looked up, the woods were silent, the trees standing still as if nothing had happened. But the memory of those voices lingered, seared into my mind. I knew I would never forget what I had heard, and I would never go back into those woods again.

But the voices didn’t stay in the woods. Now, I hear them all the time, even in the safety of my own home. They whisper to me in the dead of night, filling my mind with doubts and fears. They tell me that I’m worthless, that I’ll never escape the darkness that’s closing in around me. I don’t know how much longer I can fight them. The voices are getting louder, stronger, and I’m starting to believe what they’re saying.
