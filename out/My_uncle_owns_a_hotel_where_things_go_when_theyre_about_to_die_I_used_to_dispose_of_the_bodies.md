I've always known I was my uncle's favorite. I knew it even before the day he pulled me into his office, scratched at a fleck of blood on his collar (hazard of the job), and told me that exact thing.

“Terra, you know you're my favorite, right?”

“No duh,” I said.

“Just making sure.”

That's Uncle Grant. He isn't affectionate per se, but neither is he heartless. He’s *economical*, the type of economical that lets you grow your parents’ dumpy one-star motel into a bustling four-star hotel that fuels an entire town. At any cost necessary.

If there’s a leak in the hotel roof, he fixes it himself. If a guest complains about their pillow, he plucks feathers from a goose and stuffs them a new one.  If a bloodsucking visitor is too ravenous to be safe around the normal room service staff, he’s the one who brings them a bucket of blood. And if you’re his favorite niece, you bet he tells you.

That doesn't, however, mean that he's my favorite anything.

Not after he turned out to be a murder.

But let’s back up.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Picture this.

A hotel atop a cliff.

On one side of this hotel: a cozy village with a cobbled main street and terracotta roofs. It’s the type of quaint that signals *welcome tourists! We are comfortable and warm and entirely safe. No bodies here. Nope. If you give us your money, we will give you rest.*

On the other side: the end of the whole entire world.

You probably think I mean this hotel is at the edge of a remote forest―that would be incorrect.

Then you think it must be overlooking the ocean―again, incorrect.

I mean, quite *literally,* that this hotel sits at the edge of the entire universe, on a cliff overlooking the blank, black void of eternal nothingness from which disembodied voices screech on the blackest of nights. I’m not here to deny or confirm the whole flat theory (Don’t ask. Just. Don’t), but I assure you. There’s nothing metaphorical about the eternal void.

*Come,* the voices sometimes whisper. *For a different price, we too will give you rest.*

Growing up, that's where I spent my summers. While other kids got sent to scout camp or gymnastics or loitered irresponsibly in parking lots, my cousins and I were shipped to Hotel Denouement. Supposedly, this was to ‘build character’ and ‘cement familial bonds,’ but even as a kid, I wasn’t stupid. My uncle wanted free labor, and our parents wanted a few months of peace.

*Cha-ching. Cha-ching.* A deal is made.

“I don't want to go,” I said before being sent off my first summer.

“You'll get to spend time with your cousins,” my mother replied.

“They're all boys.”

“And your aunt Cynthia. You’ll love her.” 

“She sounds terrible. I hate her. I already want to kill her. Don't make me meet Aunt Cynthia.”

“*Terra*. Sometimes growing up is doing things we don't want to do.”

“It's about doing what *you* want me to do.”

My mother sighed. “Fine. If that's what you need, then sure. It is.”

Moral of the story: being eleven years old sucks.

Even so, I persisted. I lowered my voice and summoned tears to my darling girlish eyes in a last-ditch attempt to change my mother’s mind. “What if Uncle Grant makes me dispose of the bodies?”

She responded as any mother in such a situation would: “It’s always valuable to learn new skills.”

I should once again clarify that I’m not being metaphorical. Body disposal really is a chore at Hotel Denouement. I should also probably clarify that my family isn't actually killing these aforementioned bodies. 

Usually. 

As Uncle Grant says, like calls to like. Things sense when they're close to death. They're drawn to endings, and our teetering hotel sits at the greatest ending of all: everything. Mostly we get residents coming for normal things―family vacations, corporate retreats, lost hikers stumbling from the woods with spider legs coming out their mouths, etc.―but for others, Hotel Denouement is where they come to die. 

We don't know *why* exactly. Is it a comfort thing? A migratory one? Long before Grant's hotel was constructed, things were stumbling here, foaming at the mouth, teetering towards the edge. For decades the town used to just deal with it, because there's no stopping it. No real way to understand it. 

There was, however (as Uncle Grant realized), a way to profit from it.

Humans have the toughest time knowing when the time is near. They usually don't understand what draws them here, besides they had a *feeling* to drive down this or that road and ended up in our little town. They have no idea about the undiagnosed tumor growing in their brain.

*Dogs* though―you wouldn't believe how many sick ones we get crawling to our doorstep, hacking up blood. Birds too. They fly into the void in droves. They never make it far before hands reach out from the blackness to rip them apart.

The more-than-humans always have the clearest idea though. Some of them have been alive for centuries. Species like the rat-people and groups like the Ever Nomads. The day-watchers are literally born with glowing timers ticking down on the inside of their third mouths.

Regardless of whether a thing itself knows it's going to die, we still usually do. We fluff their pillows, feed them their favorite meals, and then, when they finally pass after one or two days, sometimes up to a week, we respectfully dispose of the bodies into the eternal void.

For a slight upcharge.

But I digress.

So surprise, surprise: I lost the argument with my mother, as eleven year olds are wont to do.

 I showed up on my very first day, hair plastered to my skull by a dozen barrettes, shivering like a puppy in a rainstorm. I waited, one hand on my suitcase, as my uncle approached me through the grand front lobby. Chandeliers twinkled above. Waxed marble floors glistened below. A guest in a high-necked trench coat retrieved their room key from the front desk; he caught me staring, and a single tentacle slithered beneath his collar.

Grant got nearer. What would he have me do? Room cleaning? Garbage removal? *Blood* removal? 

He walked straight past me.

“Hello?”

But he didn’t hear me. He was fiddling with the wall-mounted A.C. controller.

“Uncle Grant?”

Still no recognition.

“HEY!”

He startled and turned. So did most of the incoming residents.

“What do you want me to do!” I demanded. Even as a kid, I had a nasty temper.

“Oh! Terra. Right. Your mom told me you were coming. Sure. Um… Let’s have you, uh, start by, um…counting the doors? Yeah. You can count the doors.”

So basically that's how my first summer went.

It became very apparent very quickly that Grant neither needed nor knew what to do with me. My older cousins he’d task with carting luggage or scrubbing away the oozing black goo that sometimes leaked from the fifth floor walls. *I*, however, was told to stitch flowers on doilies. Or hand wash pillowcases I’d already heard were slated for the incinerator.

If it weren’t for Aunt Cynthia (turns out mothers are occasionally right; I adored her), I wouldn’t have made it through that first summer. She invited me for tea on Thursdays and let me shadow her on the days she came to help at the hotel. Truly wonderful woman. Loved her.

Even so, that first summer sucked.

So did the second.

“Why am I even here?” I asked Grant my first month back. “You don’t let me do anything. You forget I’m here.”

“Course we don’t. You’re family. All family’s important. It’s a big help, all that you…”

He promptly got distracted by paperwork and forgot to finish his thought. I shrieked, slammed his office door, and ran away.

In the end, that was the issue I think.

I’m tempted to blame my forgettability on the easy, unchangeable things. I was the youngest cousin. One of the only girls. I was small for my age, while the others were all bigger for theirs. If I’m honest, though, the real issue was my horrific Frankenstein of a personality: over-earnest mixed with explosive anger.

In elementary school, I would desperately laugh at classmates’ jokes when nobody else would. I’d buy the popular girls friendship bracelets, even if I didn’t know them, in hopes of birthday party invitations.

Then, when they giggled at my eagerness―because children are vicious little sociopaths―I’d explode. I’d shove over my desk, hit them with sticks at recess, and scream until I passed out.

I was too earnest to seem important and too emotional to take seriously.

By my third summer, I convinced myself I no longer cared what Uncle Grant thought of me―partly a defense mechanism and partly a result of a newfound goth phase (let’s not talk about it). I stopped trying to help out. Aunt Cynthia let me come over most days of the week and help her take care of my baby cousin. My brain and body drifted into an easy state of apathy.

It probably would have continued like that for years. My mother forcing me to go to Hotel Denouement. Uncle Grant ignoring me. Me caring less and less and less.

Eventually, I would have been old enough to refuse. I could have stayed home for the summer, joined a swim team, forgotten entirely about my cousins and the idea of more-than-humans. It’s what *would* have happened.

If it weren’t for the bloodsucker.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

I recognized the signs before anybody else. 

It was my third summer. I was thirteen now, but Grant had almost entirely stopped pretending to give me chores. Probably, that was why I noticed things first: so much more free time. Or maybe even back then I had a sense for these things.

“There’s a smell near 613,” I told Grant at the front desk.

“If they want room cleaning they can call for it.”

“It smells like dead body.”

He frowned and checked through a few folders. “Mmm, no. Nobody in that hallway is expected to pass on.”

Which I already knew. We tried to keep dying residents on odd numbered floors. Before I could explain to Grant that *I actually don’t happen to be an idiot, funny enough,* he added, “I’ll get Lenny to check on it.”

Lenny never checked.

It was janitorial who found the body.

A few days later, somebody passed away who was actually supposed to. He was a long time visitor, according to my uncle. His family had been giving us business for years and years: holiday trips, reunions, the works. It was only natural they would come here at the end of his life to tie things off with a comfortable bow.

I entered the death room with a bowl of mints for the grieving family, but they were gone. Maybe they’d decided to try for a bit of sleep―not really sure―but the dead man lay unattended on the bed.

His face was white. Too white. I’d seen corpses before, but this was a new level of pale.

“That’s why embalmers use makeup for funerals,” Uncle Grant told me.

“This was different. It wasn’t normal looking.”

“Death is never normal looking.”

“Neither is your daughter.”

“Watch it.”

There were other signs. 

Residents slated to pass on started dying earlier than anticipated, without cause. More residents than normal started showing up to the town InstaCare. They reported fatigue and dizziness, sleepwalking and memory loss.

“You’re not listening to me!” I finally screamed after trying (and failing) to point out these oddities to my cousins and uncle. Aunt Cynthia was the only one who believed me, but even she'd just encouraged me to approach her husband myself. *Independent learning* was the term she'd used. Bull crap.

“Terra, *please*,” Grant said. “No shouting in front of the residents.” 

On cue a woman with a cane hobbled past his open office door. He flashed a smile and waved.

Fine then.

*Fine*.

I started tracking who was taking advantage of our complimentary breakfast, and who seemed to handle feeding on their own. In the rare moments when the front desk was left unattended, I snuck peeks at our check-in files. For an entire week, I stalked the four residents who had been here longest, since the weird things started. I rotated between them, hardly sleeping myself.

On day seven, in the dead of the night, I finally witnessed what I’d been waiting for.

A ninth floor hallway stretched in front of me, pinstripe wallpaper and luxury carpet. I’d followed an elderly woman all the way here. She was barely taller than me, with a cane and a limp. The entire day I’d stalked her, she’d been nothing but cheery. Even so, something about her…

She hobbled to the door of a guest on their deathbed (literally. They’d made us carry their special memory foam mattress all the way to the ninth floor). She wriggled the doorhandle. Our doors were old school. They had to be manually locked, and sometimes guests forgot.

It didn’t open. 

She clucked a tongue and glanced to either side, missing where I crouched in a shadowy nook. She giggled in much the way an elderly lady might do before asking *would you like to see pictures of my grandchildren?* Then she unsheathed her cane.

That's not entirely right. Even now, I'm not totally sure of the words to describe it, but an unsheathing is the closest comparison. She pulled the cane from her right hand with her left, but something long, sinuous, and veinlike stayed behind. 

She didn’t hold it. It protruded from the palm of her hand and flopped to the floor, now free from the hollow of the cane. The tip of it slithered up to the doorhandle and into the keyhole. A few seconds later a lock clicked. The old lady giggled again then teetered inside.

I did what any thirteen year old with anger issues would do.

I followed her in.

For the record, I did consider the situation first. I even contemplated finding Grant or an older cousin―but what was the point? That had never worked before. The only one who would believe me was Aunt Cynthia, and she was all the way in town.

Even before I entered, the slurping was audible. 

A wet, gurgling, sucking. The window curtains were drawn, revealing the empty nothingness of the void beyond. The room lights were out, but the hallway lit the scene.

She stood over him. Her head was raised, her eyes closed, and her mouth parted in satisfaction. From her outstretched palm, the tubelike thing snaked over the sheets and into the dying man’s mouth. It swelled and undulated, full of dark, pulsing fluid.

The tube was a straw.

The man’s entire body convulsed. He choked on the obstruction. His eyes were open. They stared at me, pupils fully dilated. *Begging*. 

For a long while, I watched. Only once the flow of liquid showed signs of slowing did I back out of the room and retrieve the fire ax from the emergency box in the hallway. It was red. Shiny. Pretty even…

When I returned, I slammed it into the old lady’s neck.

The first strike barely penetrated skin, but she toppled in shock. She flailed. The second strike severed muscles. The third, and fourth, and fifth, severed arteries, ligaments, and bone.

In the struggle the blood straw pulled taut, still firmly lodged in the man’s throat. His body jerked at the tension, and thudded off the bed. I barely spared him a thought. My goal was a singular one. I swung the ax again.

And again. 

And again.

She wouldn’t die. Her spine was snapped and her throat shredded to ribbons, but still the bloodsucker blinked up at me, loathing in her expression. She twitched.

A snarl ripped from my lips. “Fine!”

I retrieved a spare trolley and wheeled the mangled woman down the hallway, to the elevator, and out the main entrance.

“Terra?” asked my cousin at the front desk. Then after seeing my brand of luggage: “What in the holy―!”

I didn’t wait. I didn’t slow. I was a young teen on a mission.

“Can you finish her off?” I called when I reached the cliff's edge. 

All-consuming blackness watched me, so thick with emptiness it was practically tangible. The disembodied voices stayed silent. I'd seen Grant speaking to them before but no one else. Could they even hear me?

“If you want her you can have her, but I'm not wasting my time if you're not going to―”

“*Give her to us,”* rose the voices.

“I just need the head back.”

“*We will have all of her.*”

“No deal.” I whirled to leave.

“*Wait! You will have your token.”*

Minutes later, I banged on the entrance of my uncle's study where he often worked late into the night. When he didn't answer, I threw open the door and stormed in.

“Terra,” he started. “What―”

“If I'm gonna do all your work for you, then at least start paying me.” I slammed the severed head on his desk, tongue lolling, intestines trailing from the neck.

He stared.

His lips twitched into a smile.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

Things changed after that.

By the end of that third summer, Uncle Grant was sending me on errands he usually gave to my adult cousins: special deliveries, maintenance jobs, intense room cleaning for more-than-humans that tended to explode at death.

By the end of the next summer, he was trusting me with things he wouldn't give to even them. Things like removing violent residents from the premises. Parleying with the void. Delivering threats to meddlesome townspeople (as needed).

It’s not like we were running a secret crime operation. But when you operate a hotel at the end of the world things can get… *messy*. Sometimes, it takes extreme measures to maintain peace.

I did try to stay mad. All throughout each school year, I would summon all my anger, let it simmer, build to the point of eruption. Grant had only taken interest in me once I’d proven I was useful, never before. That wasn’t love. It was favoritism. It was just as cruel as ignoring me, just a different flavor.

I’d arrive at Hotel Denouement every summer, with all that righteous rage in an over-pressurized can in my stomach, fully prepared to release it.

Every summer, it would melt away. 

It was nice being wanted. That’s the truth of it. I’d spent my entire life giggled at from behind textbooks and skipped over when handing out birthday invites and told I was *too much.* For the first time, none of that was the case. I wasn’t just tolerated. I wasn’t just good at what I did. I was *essential*. 

The whole thing would come collapsing down without me there plugging the leaks with my fingers. I’d been the odd screw at the back of the drawer, the one that never fit no matter where you tried it. Even if I didn’t technically have friends at Denouement, I’d still, at last, finally found my hole.

That isn’t entirely true―about not having friends. I did have Mateo.

I don’t want to talk about him.

Perhaps the most obvious sign of my uncle’s trust was his daughter. He never let anyone watch her besides himself and Cynthia. Nobody. *Ever*. But then, the summer after I’d graduated, Grant pulled me into his office

“Terra,” he said. “You know you're my favorite, right?”

“No duh.”

“Just making sure.”

“‘K, so what do you want?”

He laughed and held up his hands. “Cynthia and I have a thing all tomorrow. You wouldn’t mind watching Lucy, would you?”

I sucked in my breath, trying not to show my reaction. “Yeah. Sure.”

“Lifesaver―oh, and one more thing…” 

He kept talking. Handed me something to deliver. Told me what to do with it. 

All the while, I only nodded, hardly paying attention. Watching Lucy would be easy. She was as much a gem as her mother―but it was more than that.

The whole summer Grant had started insinuating things, that he wouldn’t be around forever and he’d need a replacement when he was gone. That maybe, *maybe*, if I decided to work here full time instead of going to college, he could start passing off even more of his responsibilities. I hadn't actually believed any of it. He would never let go of the hotel. 

But now? With him asking me to watch his only daughter by myself? This changed everything. For once in my existence, I looked forward to the future with something akin to excitement rather than the dread that usually accompanied my imaginings. My life took shape.

The next morning my aunt was dead. 

I quit immediately.

Permanently.

Before I left, I made good on my promise to watch Lucy that whole next day. I was the only cousin with a chance at soothing her, and besides that, Grant had asked me to.

He’d already known he would be busy. 

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

I hate my uncle. I really do. But if I’m really honest with myself―something I generally advise against as it brings only pain―the real reason I hate Grant isn’t because I think he killed his wife. It isn’t even for ruining the one place I’ve ever belonged.

That thing he had me deliver that fateful night?

Sleeping meds.

“Don’t wake her,” he told me. “She has a hard enough time falling asleep as is. Door key’s under the mat. Just drop one in the water glass beside her bed. She always wakes up around four and uses it to sleep the last few hours.”

I did what he asked.

He slept at the hotel that night. Work stuff. Very busy. That’s why, when I showed up the next morning to watch Lucy, *I* was the one who found aunt Cynthia. He’d been right. The pills had helped her sleep. A line of foam trailed down her cheek.

The reason I loathe my uncle isn’t for murdering his wife.

It’s because he wasn’t the one[ who did](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).
