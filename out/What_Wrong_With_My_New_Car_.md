Today is my 18th birthday. I am not expecting much other than chilling and watching TikTok all day. It isn't that I hate birthdays; it's just that my family doesn't celebrate birthdays, and I recently broke up with my bf, Daniel. Since Daniel cheated on me with my cousin, I felt betrayed. However, I tried to move on and not to think about him.

As I was lying on my bed watching the crazy trend "we listen and we don't judge," which is kind of hilarious.

"Brianna! There is something outside," my sister shouted my name.

I exited my room and rapidly ran down the stairs with a bat in my hand. "What happened? Are you okay, Bryssa?" I said while I panicked and was eager to fight. "Girlll, relax and put the bat down!" my sister said.

As I placed my bat on the floor, I walked outside and noticed that there was a black Mercedes-Benz with a red bow on top of the vehicle.

"You got me a car? I stated.

"No, I was about to go out to get the mail, but the car randomly showed up in the middle of the driveway," said my sister.

"That's strange," I said.

I walked outside to observe the car and saw a letter on the car seat, labeled "Bri," which is my nickname. I opened the letter and discovered that it was from Daniel. I kept the Mercedes but tore up the letter and threw it in the middle of the ground. I was excited and grabbed my phone to tell my friends about it.

\*Few Hours Later\*

I decided to get all dressed up so I could test out my new car. I quickly hopped in the car, fastened my seatbelt, and began to drive around the neighborhood. Then I got hungry, so I grabbed my phone to see if "On The Border Restaurant" was open.

I drove on the road bridge, but all of a sudden my car randomly stopped in the middle of the road. The infotainment system began to glitch, and many people were honking at me. I quickly pushed all of the buttons that were on the infotainment system and put my foot on the gas and brake, hoping that the car would eventually start.

None of it seems to be working, so I grab my phone to try to call the mechanic, but my phone notifies me that it has no signal around my area. I tried to unbuckle my seatbelt, but it seemed to be stuck and become tighter.

I was scared and confused; I banged and waved at the window to get one of the car drivers to assist me, but they just ignored me and drove around me. Then I saw the mini radiator fall off the air conditioning itself, but something just moved inside the air conditioner, and it looked like a silver metal robotic seatbelt slowly coming out toward me while the infotainment system randomly began to make a loud beep sound, which it was going nonstop.

I immediately went insane, grabbed the car handle, and attempted to open the door, but it wouldn't open. The robotic seatbelt proceeded near my face; I swung at it, which instantly shocked me. I burst into tears while the robotic seatbelt wrapped around me where I couldn't move.

All of a sudden I heard my ex-boyfriend, Daniel, laughing through the car speaker while the car began to move on its own. "Happy Birthday, Darling! Do you miss me?" said Daniel.
