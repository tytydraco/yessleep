In all my years on this earth, I’d never seen my father angry.

He’d get upset, sure, but he’d never take it out on anyone. If you messed up, he’d be patient and try to work it out with you. If something frustrated him that was out of his control, he’d never complain; he’d just bite his tongue and stay optimistic.

“It’ll turn out better next time,” he’d say.

 With me especially, it was rare he’d ever even raise his voice. If I got in trouble, he’d make sure to let me know and come up with some sort of punishment, but it was never in a hostile way. It was always with grace. Always like it was for my own good, and not because I’d inconvenienced him.

Even that night at the Warehouse when he’d had to drive hours up to my campus just to bail me out of jail, he didn’t get mad. He knew I already felt like crap about what I’d done, so there was no point in shoving my nose in it.

The funny thing was, it always worked. The feeling of knowing that I’d let my saint of a father down was so much worse than seeing him lash out and scream. I thought that there was no worse feeling on this planet than that of disappointing my father, and I lived for years feeling that way.

That was until the day that I finally *did* see what he looked like angry.

I came shuffling up my dorm stairs after a particularly grueling weekend, hair a mess and clothes looking ragged. I didn’t even want to know what I probably smelled like. It had started Friday night at the Warehouse like it usually did, but after that, it’d quickly gone off the rails.

Trevor and I had only been seeing each other a few weeks by that point—not even anything official, but he was already my new favorite pastime. I hadn’t been to the bar nearly as much, and even when I did go on occasion, he’d often join, telling me that he didn’t mind them so much anymore now that he’d found the perfect dance partner.

That weekend, though, it was finals, and Trevor was busy studying for most of it. I’d shot him one last text telling him good luck and teasing him for being a nerd, then I’d agreed to tag along with some friends to the Warehouse for the night. I’d told myself that it had been a while since I’d gone all out, and so certainly I could control my habits better than I used to.

I’d also told myself that it was just because I’d be bored otherwise cooped up in my dorm, but I think I knew that if I wasn’t there, and I wasn’t with Trevor, I’d have nothing to keep my thoughts at bay, and I still wasn’t ready to face them…

It had actually started out how I’d planned. Just a few drinks to get loose, and some casual swaying on the floor. I shooed anyone away who tried to make a move, letting them know I was taken, but still, the place didn’t feel right without Trevor.

That’s why when somebody suggested bouncing over to a party on the other side of campus, I was in. There was a lot more to get lost in at a party that didn’t involve the wandering eyes of strangers, so it seemed like the better place to be.

And get lost I did.

Once we were there, the pressure to drink was only magnified, and though I pretended to try to shrug it off, I was more than happy to embrace it. Slipping back into that blurry haze had never felt so good, and before I knew it, it was 5am and I was passed out on a couch. I’d slept most of that day away on a musky frat house sofa; so long in fact, that by the time I woke up, the Saturday night party had already started revving up again.

Trevor was gone all weekend, right? So what was the harm?

Another night ensued of me getting more hammered than I’d been in weeks, as well as some extra ‘substances’ to help me feel a little better. I was on top of the world in that moment, feeling so proud while laughing with friends that I’d finally struck the balance between that numbing bliss, and still maintaining control enough not to self-destruct.

Of course, drunken me didn’t take into account that I was no longer alone. I couldn’t vanish for nights on end and have nobody worry about me.

And so there I was, shuffling up the stairs to my room that Sunday, a look of surprise on my face when I saw my dad standing outside my dorm, arms crossed and staring at me with the most intense expression I’d ever seen.

“D-Dad?” I muttered softly, “What are you doing here—”

“Can I come in?” He asked me, the tone in his voice unlike any I’d ever heard before.

It was enough to make me not ask why. I didn’t even greet him otherwise or offer a hug. I knew he was upset, and he knew that I knew it. My pounding, drunken head fumbled the keys to my room for a moment before finally getting the door unlocked and shuffling inside.

I didn’t say anything at all. I just moved over to my bed and sat down on it, eyes glued to the floor waiting for him to make the first move. He stood opposite at my desk, hands jammed in his pockets and breathing hard, trying to cage whatever emotion was thrashing to come out.

It was painful, ringing silence for what felt like an hour. I could hear my heartbeat through my headache as it kept the time with the ticking of the clock. Finally, I wasn’t able to bear it anymore, and my anger started to poke through. I didn’t know what game he was playing here, but his burning eyes weren’t helping anything, and I was too hungover to play it.

“Dad, I’m an adult,” I told him, lifting my head and guessing at the current topic, “If I want to go out on the weekend, I’m going to go out.”

That was the wrong opening line. I saw his face tense a little more, and he stuck his tongue to the back of his lip while nodding, still trying not to erupt, “Absolutely. Of course you are.”

“Then why are you here?” I asked, trying not to show the intimidation I felt.

Dad kept his gaze on me, then pulled his hands from his coat, tossing them casually and landing them on his lap. He spoke plainly, “Well, there I was this morning, about to head out for church, when all the sudden I get a call from the security office. Apparently, this real nice boy you’ve been seeing gave you a text yesterday morning to see if you had made it home alright, and when he never heard anything back from you, he tried calling all yesterday through to this morning just to see if everything was okay.”

My tongue felt dry, and my stomach coiled in on itself.

“Now, don’t get me wrong,” Dad mocked, with an understanding face, “I was young once too, I get the weekend bender, Henny. Heck, I even understand if you wanna ghost the kid—”

“I-I wasn’t trying to—”

“But if you’re going to disappear for a weekend, could you at least let someone know where you are so that I don’t get a call from the campus—scaring the *shit* out of me—telling me that you’ve gone missing?”

I winced a bit at that sentence. I’d never heard Dad swear, not even letting it slip by accident. Tears welled in my eyes, and I saw them begin to form in his too. At seeing my guilt, he softened and shook his head.

“I thought the worst, Henny,” he told me, his words a choppy, shattered mess, like glass scraping at his throat, “I thought maybe someone had hurt you, or that things had gotten too much and you might… you might have…”

That made tears begin falling down my face. Dad wasn’t stupid; he knew my mental state for a long time. He always did what he could to make sure I was alright, but no matter how badly you may want to, you can’t make somebody be happy.

“I’m okay, Dad…” I whimpered, “I’m sorry I scared you…”

He wiped his tears and nodded, then looked to the ceiling, preparing for an onslaught of more, “You’re all I have left, Henny. The only good thing I have—I can’t lose you too.”

My heart broke for him at that. All the years of being strong for me—all those years of keeping me safe and taking on so much weight from Mom's passing—just to finally let it out. To finally let slip that unspoken pain he’d lived his life under since she was gone.

He needed me to be okay. He needed me to be happy because I was the only joy he still had. The sun that kept that smile on his lips in the darkest of times.

My heart broke because I didn’t know how. I didn’t know how to spare him from that when I couldn’t even spare myself.

I shook my head, one long squeak of breath slipping past my lips until the pressure burst and I fell into sobs. I folded into myself and clutched at the sides of my shirt, the first traces of pain in my bones so barely imperceptible.

Dad moved slowly to sit next to me, then pulled me close, letting me wail into his coat and wet it with my tears. Between rattled sobs, I spoke.

“It hurts, Dad… The pain keeps coming and it just won’t stop.”

It may seem silly to some. That after one loss, your whole life can come falling apart. Plenty of people have lost more and still managed to be well-adjusted individuals in the world around them. Maybe that just meant I was weak. Dad was fine, and he was of the same blood, even.

But for me, it was so much more than the pain of no longer seeing my mother. It was the lack of her. The absence was felt every year she wasn’t there. The idea that in each memory made in the wide tapestry of life, her thread was no longer among the fabric. It was the way that our lives were derailed now that she was gone; the money troubles and debt left behind. It was the way that her loss fucked me up so bad that even I couldn’t repair it. My isolation and impulsive behavior. My anger and my fear of anything unknown.

Most of all, it was the simple thought that when life got hard and I needed the familiar comfort of home, I no longer had my mother to hold me tight and tell me things were going to be okay.

That one little thread being pulled from the tapestry had unraveled the whole thing, and now I lay among the tattered, tangled pile on the floor, doing my best to stitch it all back together.

Dad gently brushed his hand through my hair, then softly kissed my scalp, “There’s no stopping it, Henny. Pain is just as much a part of us as everything else. Once it's in there, it’s in there, and you aren’t going to make it leave.”

He slipped his hand into mine, then gently brushed a thumb over a scar on my knuckles where my fist had once smashed an innocent girl’s face.

“You have to be gentle with it. Let it howl, and snarl, and maybe even bite you a couple times. Show it that you can bear its horrible company. Then, once it’s settled down, you can guide it. Find it a spot that’s not too uncomfortable for it to post up, and let it lie down. Somewhere that won’t make you wince when it decides to sharpen its nails or howl at the moon.”

Dad finally laced his fingers into mine and squeezed tight.

“If you keep trying to fight it or hold it down, that beast isn’t going to stop thrashing and clawing around. But if you show it that it has a home somewhere, no matter how small, I promise it’ll stop tearing through you to find one.”

The last of my tears rolled off my cheeks and fell onto the back of his old, rugged hand over top of mine. I sniffled and nodded, even though I wasn’t quite sure what he meant by all of that. The last thing I wanted to do was let that pain stay inside me, but he did have a point. My way hadn’t exactly worked out the best.

After a beat of us just sitting in each other's company, he finally spoke again, a slight snicker to break the tension, “So when do I get to meet this boy you’ve been seeing?”

I let a laugh loose past my tight throat, then wiped my eyes. “Maybe never after this weekend…” I mumbled, “He’s probably pissed at me.”

“Oh, come now, Henny. The kid was so worried about you that he reported you missing. He must think you’re something special if he was that antsy.”

I let out another loose laugh, then nodded. “Sorry I scared you, Dad. I won’t ever do it again, I promise.”

“That’s alright, honey; I’m just glad you’re safe. Now, you should probably go get showered. You smell like an old, sweaty keg. You aren’t winning that boy back smelling that way.”

I giggled and then shoved him away as I sat up, feeling the weight lift off my shoulders, if only for a few hours. Just like that, he was back to his usual warm self, not a hint of anger or resentment in his eyes. Then again, maybe he was never angry to begin with. Maybe he was just a poor, scared man with everything left to lose.

I couldn’t help but reflect on the last thing I’d said to him in that moment, and feel a bitter, painful sting in my stomach.

I’d promised him I’d never scare him in such a way again, a promise that I’d very much broken by now. If he had assumed the worst of me after only a day, I was horrified to see what state he might be in after me missing for months.

I prayed that on the outside of the hell I was in, he was okay. That in my absence, he hadn’t done anything foolish having lost both of his only family left.

This was one of the thoughts that gave me the strength to continue limping toward the door of the library and back into the hall. I needed to get home. To finally see this bitter journey to its end.

Of course, there was one more matter standing in the way. One more hurdle that I needed to vault if I was ever to see the light of day again.

Ann.

I had a decision to make now, and a very big one at that. What was I to do about my last clone? I was a shambled mess; practically a corpse walking—fighting her was off the table.

Though, that wasn’t really an option even if I was capable, was it?

I knew the truth now. The truth about what my clones were and what I was capable of. Well, that was accurate. I didn’t know why it was that way or how exactly it worked, but I knew the core principles.

I could either take Ann back into myself, or I could leave her here like she was planning to do to me.

That was the decision. That big, million-dollar question on the line. Because, unlike my other clones, I didn’t need Ann, did I? Hen 5 had gotten back in on a technicality; a moment of empathy where I saw the monster that I’d created. Hope and June? I would have taken them back on any day. But Ann? The backstabbing shadow of all my worst qualities made manifest was not something I wanted to take back into myself.

I felt enlightened after everything that I’d been through—like an entirely new woman about to walk out of this place. I could have asked for a less intense form of therapy, but the fact was, once I was out of this place, I was never going to look at what short span I had left on life the same ever again.

Why would I want to taint all of that by slurping the scum that’d come out of me back in?

As much as I could pretend Ann was fully rotten, though, I couldn’t. I’d seen her goodness in the flickers between all the bad deeds. She’d really tried to help Hope. Even if she’d complained most of the time, she’d still pushed hard for all of us to keep trying to get out of this place (at least, before she decided to backstab us). Every bad deed came with a caveat of good, and I guess that meant the question came down to whether the positive gained was worth the rot that came with it.

Then, there was the other side of the coin. Even if I tried to take Ann back in, I needed to reach a point of understanding with her, something that seemed impossible at this point. While I wasn’t her biggest fan, she hated me even more, and that was going to place quite the strain on my trying to walk up and hug her back into my heart.

It seemed nearly impossible, which meant that if I couldn’t kill Ann, and I couldn’t coax her back into my soul—or wherever my clones were ending up—there was only one other way it all ended.

Ann killed me or left me here to die. She’d win and get to go back to my old life, while I slowly rotted away in here, succumbing to my injuries and weeping for a life that I’d squandered.

That thought made me shiver as I finally reached the main corridor and took a deep breath. I gave a long, hard look down the hall to the blast doors waiting for me on the other side, then ran the scenarios in my head. When none seemed to have happy endings, I looked up and saw something that took my mind off the bleak, only for a moment.

The ‘External Communication Terminal’.

Almost in a trance, I began scraping my way over to it, barely even feeling the pain in my limbs.

As I approached, I looked at the camera hanging above the call box. I didn’t know if Ann would still be watching, but if she was, I wouldn’t have much time to talk. On top of that, it would also blow my cover as June, but that honestly didn’t matter too much anymore. If I was getting out of here, it wasn’t going to be under the guise of a fragment of myself.

I needed to be Hensley, and every part of her.

I didn’t know what was going to happen in the coming moments. I didn’t know how this story was going to end. But if I wasn’t going to make it out of here, I needed to wrong just one more right.

I reached the nook and collapsed in the chair, taking on the pain that I knew would come with getting back up. Slipping my hand into my pocket, I felt around for the old faithful slab that was sitting there; my one portal back to reality since the beginning of this mess. With a tired grunt, I leaned forward, taking the corresponding cable in my hand and jacking it into my device.

My phone let me know there was a new device connected, and the terminal itself beeped, telling me to scan my Employee I.D. to make a call. Painfully curling my aching bones over, I reached for the keycard in my other pocket, then withdrew it, my heart pounding as I slotted it into the machine.

“Please…” I begged silently.

The terminal beeped again, and the screen changed to a new message.

*‘1 call credit remaining. Would you like to use it now?’*

My throat went tight, and water blurred my vision with relief. Yes, it was only 1 chance, but it was still a chance nonetheless. With a trembling finger, I pressed yes, then picked up my phone. I opened my contacts page, then bit my cheek hard.

I could have called for help. Contacted a crisis hotline and let them know that the missing girl who’d vanished months ago was still alive. Seen if maybe by some miracle, they could save me from the outside, and I could avoid Ann altogether.

I knew this was a lost cause, however. If someone was coming for me, they would have done so a long time ago, and chances were, Kingfisher wasn’t going to let anyone know what was going on in here.

I could have called Dad. I knew it would have been the right thing to do. After that promise I’d made him, I almost owed it to him to be the one I called. Tell him I loved him and wished that I could just feel his warm hugs one last time. That I was sorry for being too much of a coward to tell him about my cancer.

I didn’t call Dad, though. As messed up as it is to say, I didn’t want to give him hope. I didn’t want him to hear my voice again in case I didn’t end up making it back. Neither Ann nor I truly knew how the drill worked, and even after the two of us had our showdown, there was no guarantee that either of us made it back. It was better for him to just hold out a little longer for my return, and to not disturb the embers of his faith that were already going to be burning so dangerously low.

No, there was only one person that I could think of calling. The one person who would be willing to listen to me and take my situation as it was. The one person who had always done those things for me, even back home, and whose face I’d spit in anytime they showed me that grace.

Maybe that was the real reason I decided to call Trevor. Because I couldn’t bear the thought of dying without telling him that I was sorry.

I clicked his contact, and the call pulled up.

It took a long, long time to even start ringing. So long, that I began to panic the call might not go through. Maybe Kingfisher had remembered to shut the box down before leaving so that none of the people trapped in here could let the outside know of Shae’s misdeeds. I remember thinking that it would honestly be a little funny. They forgot to turn the portal that spirited people into this place off, but not the phone booth.

Thankfully, after a few minutes, I heard the first ring. After 5, the phone picked up, and all I heard was white noise.

My heart was thunder rattling through my veins, and I swallowed hard before speaking with shaky breath.

“Hello?”

“Hello?” I heard Trevor's beautiful voice call back, making me shut my eyes tight and stifle a sob. “Hello, who is this?”

I took a deep breath to gather myself, then quivered out, “Trevor? Honey, it’s me…”

The silence that followed lasted only a few seconds, but it was enough to know that the whole world had dropped out from under him. He came back loud and frantic, panic in his voice, “H-Hensley? Oh my God—Hensley, is that you?” I heard tears and sobs start to strangle his throat, and he continued, “Hensley, sweetheart, please tell me that’s you…”

I didn’t even try to control my weeping anymore. I broke down into the microphone and gripped the phone tight as if Trevor could feel it, “Yeah, hun. It’s me.”

“Oh my God, where are you? Hensley, where on earth have you been—we’ve been worried sick about you; I-I thought…” his voice trailed off, like he couldn’t finish the thought, but he forced himself to anyway, “I thought you were dead. I thought you ran off to—”

I cut back in to spare him saying it aloud, “I’m fine, Trevor, I’m okay. I’m right here.”

“Where is here? Where the hell are you? Hensley, please come home—I’m sorry that I—”

“Trevor, baby, please,” I said curtly, yet gently, stopping him before he got too riled up. With a trembling sigh, I began to explain, “I’m sorry I’ve been missing—I promise, I didn’t mean to be gone so long. Something happened though, and before I tell you, I need you to promise to not ask questions.”

“What? What does that mean? Hen, you’re not—”

“I don’t know how to answer them, Trev,” I whimpered, “I don’t know where I am or how I got here, but… I’m lost somewhere that you won’t find me. No matter how hard you or anyone else looks, you won’t find me. That’s all I know, so please don’t try to ask me more…”

There was a pause as he thought, and I could tell he wanted to go against my wishes. I could hear him actively tugging the reins on his tongue. The sincerity in my voice must have been enough for him, so instead, he softly offered, “Hensley, you’re scaring me…”

“I know; and I’m sorry,” I told him, leaning my head to the counter and tapping it hard on the surface, “I’m scared too. But I’m coming home, okay? I promise that soon I’m going to get out of this place, and then I’m going to do everything in my power to make it back to you.”

Another pause.

“Hen, are you okay? Are you in danger?”

“No,” I lied, “I was, but I’m not anymore. I’m just tired, and… I miss you. I miss you so much.”

I heard Trevor release a small breath of amusement across his mic, then stifle a sob, “I’ve missed you to, Hen. More than you can possibly know.”

With my eyes closed, a smile spread across my lips, and I rolled my head on the counter from forehead to cheek. The table was cold and hard, but there with Trevor's warm voice on the other end of the line, it was easy to imagine my head was on a soft, warm pillow, cuddling in bed next to him while he softly played with my hair.

More tears pooled in a puddle against my face, and I spoke again, “Hey, Trev?”

“Yeah?”

“I’m sorry… For everything. For the way I treat you and for the way I erupt. I’m sorry for the things I said before I left. I didn’t mean any of them—I was just scared.” I pulled the phone close to my face, “I told you that we’d only been together a year like it wasn’t much, but honestly? That year was the happiest I’d ever been in my whole life.”

Trevor let out an angelic chuckle of joy, then softly cooed, “It’s alright; I know you were scared, Hen. I’m sorry for making it harder on you—I just didn’t want to lose you.”

“No—Trevor, stop,” I hushed, “You don’t need to apologize. You just wanted the best for me, and I didn’t know how to handle that…” I swallowed the lump in my throat, along with the pride still hidden there, and said, “I’m ready now, okay? When I get home, I’m ready to fight this. Whether I make it or not, I’m ready. I’m sorry I wasn’t before.”

Trevor let out another small laugh, but this one sounded more out of disbelief than it did amusement. Softly, he told me, “Hensley, I was never upset because you didn’t want to do the treatment. If it’s not what you want to go through, then I understand.” His voice changed to the most tender tone I’d ever heard, and he softly whispered, “I was upset because you were trying to hide…”

His words made another surge of tears come to my eyes, and I blinked them away. Trevor was always too good at reading me, and I hated it. It made me exposed and vulnerable, something I never like to be.

For a moment, he read me better than I’d read myself. I didn’t know what he’d meant at first until I dwelled on it more and found he was right.

I wasn’t hiding from the pain and the pressure that I knew chemo would bring. I was hiding from that snarling, vile pain that I’d let run wild inside for far too long. Pain from when fate had played me a fool for hoping, an act I didn’t want to be caught in twice.

A beep from the terminal caught my attention, and I lifted my head to see a one-minute warning. I internally cursed that the call was so short, but we’d both said exactly what we needed to, and if I wasn’t going to be fate’s fool by the end of this, then I needed to finally close the act on this twisted play.

“Hey, baby? I need to go now, okay? The call is about to end.”

“Wait, Hensley, please, is there anything you can tell me?” he begged frantically, his calm façade shattered, “J-Just describe where you are, and I can—”

“Please don’t look for me, Trev,” I told him gently, “If I don’t make it home, I’m begging you, don’t come looking.”

My words felt hollow and weak, the realization hitting me now that this was it. once the call dropped, the rest was all unknown. Realizing there was one last variable I was forgetting, I offered a few more parting words.

“And, Trevor? If I do make it home and I seem different? If I don’t seem like the same Hensley that I am right now… I just want you to know that I love you, okay? I love you so much, and I will always love you; no matter how I may act.”

“Hensley, what does that mean? I don’t understand why you won’t—”

“I’ll see you soon, okay baby?” I squeaked out, my hand pulling the phone away and hovering over the end button. “Tell my dad I love him too, okay?”

“Wait, Hen—just hang on a sec—”

Before I could hear any more of his desperation, I ended the call, unable to bear anymore pain.

That was just it wasn’t it? Pain.

All of it. Most of my life. A constant battle of pain and pleasure. Numbing the former in an attempt to amplify the latter.

Dad was right; pain was just as much a part of me as everything else—if not more. More than Hope, and more than Innocence. More than the depravity that was born from it. Pain ruled over every decision I’d ever made—every mistake and outburst; every bloody nose at the bar by my hands, and every week-long road trip that ended in an abyss.

 If there was one part of me that I hadn’t forgotten or tried to bury deep like the other fragments of myself, it was pain. It was the part of me that was the most familiar when I met it in the form of myself among the dark, abandoned streets.

Ann wasn’t a manifestation of my anger and pessimism. Ann was my pain.

And Dad was right—I’d spent far too long trying to drown her to no avail.

With a labored breath, I slid my chair back and stood, collecting my phone and turning down the hall. I felt like I might keel over any moment with each step I took, leaning heavily on the wall to support myself.

My pulse was numb and slow as I reached the door and casually tapped the card to it, but it began to pick up as the metal barriers began grinding open. Ann would hear it no doubt, but that didn’t matter now. All I wanted to do was talk. That was my only plan now. No grand fight to end it all, no masterful scheme to trick my ‘wicked’ half.

I just needed to do the one thing with her that I never had.

The anticipation I felt as I entered the main corridor was nauseating. For all the pain that chemo might have brought me, I wondered if it could have ever made me feel as shitty as I did then.

The light of the control room came into view, and I paused to swallow as I finished my journey to it.

The ringing in my ears was suddenly drowned out by the ominous buzz of powerful machines and old computers as I entered the space. My pulse was a racehorse now even though I looked calm and tired on the outside. I was terrified of what was about to transpire, though I was accepting nonetheless.

I didn’t want to die, but I’d spent so long on the edge of an abyss that it was always to be expected.

I scanned the room looking for Ann, but didn’t see her anywhere. I was about to call out, but instead jumped in surprise as a figure swept in from the side of the doorway and pressed something hard to my spine.

“How the fuck did you get out?” Ann hissed.

I put my hands up and held perfectly still, “I’ll tell you that and more in a second. Can I turn around, though? I promise I’m not out to try anything. I just want to talk.”

“Bullshit, June. You’re clearly up to something. Where is Hensley—I know she’s got to be around here somewhere.”

“She is,” I told her, taking my chances and starting to rotate. Ann seemed too surprised by my confirmation to stop me, but she still took a step back to be in a position to react if need be. My hands still up, I told her, “I am Hensley.”

Ann looked at me with utter confusion for a moment before piecing it together. Her jaw clenched in frustration at being had, and she jabbed the flare gun out at me in warning, “Well wasn’t that a real nasty trick? Where’s June then, Hen? What was the point of the switch? She the one that let you out?”

“I let myself out,” I told her plainly. “I had the keycard, remember?”

A wave of realization hit, and she whirled her head around, looking back down the hall, “D-Did you let Hope out? She can’t be out—she—”

“Hope is gone.” I told her calmly, drawing her attention back to me, “June too. It’s just you and I now.”

Ann’s expression contorted into one of fear, anger, and confusion—a dangerous concoction—and I feared that I may have misspoke. She took a couple of mighty steps toward me, sticking the gun out straight and causing my to stagger back.

“What do you mean? What did you do to them, Hensley?”

“Nothing, I-I swear,” I quickly defended, trying to ease her down again, “All of them, they’re back with me now. They’re safe.”

Bewilderment won the war for control on Ann’s face, and she shook her head, “What the hell does that mean? What did you do, Hensley!?”

“Something happened out there,” I told Ann, “I reached a point with the others—a kind of understanding. I don’t know how, but they each went back into me. Turned into a weird light and just floated back in.”

Ann looked at me, blank faced, then burst out laughing, “What? What the fuck? Do you expect me to believe that?”

“I know how dumb it sounds, but…” I shrugged, letting the implications hang in the air. “We can go check the library where it happened to Hope. Her clothes will still be there, and you won’t see any blood.”

I saw my final clone analyze me for a while, trying to figure out if what I was saying was real or just another part of some elaborate scheme. When she saw my stark, serious face, her expression softened before going smug once more.

“So is that your plan then? Thought you’d come down here and hash it out with me? See if we can’t reach an agreement so *you* can go back to fucking up our old life and I can go back to just being shit on the bottom of your shoe?”

“Not quite that,” I told her, moving one of my hands down to my leg.

Ann made a grunt of warning, then rattled the gun out at me, but I just gave her a pause and reassuring glance before continuing.

“I want to show you something—I’ll go slow.”

That was enough to allow me to keep moving, but when Ann saw my struggle to pull the object from my broken leg pocket, any concern she had over me trying something cleared. Her eyes went from annoyed to amusement for a moment before widening when she saw what I lifted up.

The drill key dangled from my finger as I held my hands back up, looking her dead in the eye.

Ann made a hard dash for them, but I yanked them back, falling to the floor onto my ass. She stomped forward to lumber over me, pointing the gun down at my temple, but I clutched the key tight to my chest, not letting her see it again.

“Where did you find it?” She demanded, “Give it to me.”

“I can’t do that,” I told her.

“Yeah, well, if you can’t then I guess that’s that,” she threatened, pressing the barrel of the gun to my forehead.

I had been scared up until this point, but for some reason, in that moment, staring the bitter, jaded version of myself down in the eyes as she held a gun to my head, all of it went away. It was just another Hensley outburst, and I knew we often didn’t mean those.

“You’re going to have to do it then, Ann.” I told her, sitting up and pressing my head harder into it. “I’m not letting you leave this place alone unless you’re absolutely certain you can live with that.”

Suddenly all the fear that I’d felt moments ago transferred into her. I watched her expression go nervous, and she adjusted her finger on the flare gun, as if calling my bluff.

I didn’t blink.

When she saw this, her breath got choppy, and she began to tear up, knowing that she’d lost. The fight was rigged perfectly in her favor, but she just wasn’t strong enough to win it. All of her betrayal and vile acts to get to this point were for nothing if she couldn’t pull the trigger. Now she just had to live with the fact that she was even shittier than she’d ever imagined.

That’s what made it harder to confidently say what I was about to say with the gun still held to my head.

"You were right—back at the funeral home when we got into that fight; you were right," I told her softly, sitting up fully and bracing to stand. I flopped onto my knee and began to raise myself up, "I'm the reason we're here. But so are you."

"Fuck you." Ann snickered.

"You're the reason we stayed on that road for so long," I told her, no malice in my voice. Just pure pity. "You're the reason we couldn't tell Dad about the cancer or go home to Trevor. You're the reason we didn't want to do the treatment and why we left in the first place."

"Give me the fucking key, or I swear to God!" Ann screamed at me.

Wobbling violently, I rose fully onto my feet, "But that's the part that's not your fault. Because, like you said, I brought you here. And I was dragging you along far before that, Hensley." 

I saw the visage of my own face across from me falter for a moment at the use of her real name. Her stance relaxed ever so slightly.

"I'm the reason you are who you are. I'm the monster that made you." I confessed, "I didn't let you grow into the person you could have been. I just let the pain and the fear of everything melt inside me, then made you stew in it. I pushed you under the water so I could swim up to breathe, and then I never let you come up, Hen… I never helped both get to shore. So back and forth, we drowned until we finally sank under, and then there was no way out.”

The last of the tears I had to give began teasing at the corners of my eyes, and I made sure the regret was heavy on my face.

“I don't blame you for taking control then. I don't blame you for being the part of me that wanted to drive down that freeway for endless nights just waiting to die. To run from the pain. Because I had made you so used to that life, Hensley. And I am so, *so* sorry.”

Ann no longer had a look of anger on her face. It wasn't even intense, like I'd always known of her. Her mouth just hung open slightly, and her brows slanted downward in confused pain.

"Let's go together,” I told her, nearly a whisper, “Let's go live again. Let's go back to shore.” I point to the door, “I know you know that you can't make it out there alone. Not for long. You've been trying to drive for too long, Ann, and it always just ends with us back on that highway in one form or another.”

With one last step, I extended my hand, smiling softly.

“I'll take care of us now. I promise. There's still time to swim up together. And I need you there with me. Because even though I've hated you my whole life, and even though you're the part of us that hurts the most to keep around, I need you. You're the one who keeps me grounded. You're the one who reminds me what happens if we do give up. And I need that if I'm going to fight." With a pause, I tensed my fingers and stretched my hand a little farther, correcting myself, "If *we're* going to fight.”

Hensley, the me that I'd let consume us for so long, looked down at my hand, tears filling her eyes. They rolled down our freckled cheeks, then dripped to the cold concrete below, echoing silently through the control room. 

"I hate us…" she told me softly, her voice cracking like china. "I can't stand living in our head anymore."

"Then let's change that," I told her softly, "together."

Reluctantly, her eyes met mine once more, then with a shaky breath, she slipped her palm into mine.

With all the strength I had left in my body, I yanked her the rest of the way, slamming her into my chest and wrapping myself around her.

She was shocked at first, like a child who’d just hurt themselves but hadn’t noticed yet. But then, all at once, she broke. Hard, messy tears poured from her eyes into my jacket, I just softly rubbed her back, hushing in her ear.

“It’s okay… It’s going to be okay, Henny…”

Ann took much longer to vanish than the others. Maybe it was because it took her longer to come to terms with, or maybe it was because she needed the embrace the most, but finally, after some time, I felt her form begin to grow soft in my arm. My grip collapsed in on the pillar of sand she’d become, and all that remained was the wispy cloud of light in her wake.

I took it into me, and for the first time I could remember, I felt whole. Not happy. Not fully content.

But whole.

With one long, labored sigh, I looked around the room and the corridor beyond it, once again alone in this dark, quiet abyss, the same way I started it.

I stared down at the key in my hand, and let the last of my tears fall onto it, then turned for the console on the catwalk above me.

After all this time, I had finally given Ann a home, and it was time to return to mine.
