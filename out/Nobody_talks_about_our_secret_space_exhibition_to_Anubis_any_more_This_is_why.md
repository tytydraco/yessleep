*Ten…*

My wife, Pandora, gripped my hand until her knuckles turned white. She cracked a thin smile.

*Nine…*

*Eight…*

The engines started to roar with life, their power shooting through my spine. It was like driving a sports car, except my palms were sweating and my face was white as chalk.

*Seven…*

*Six…*

Tears stung my face. The past few months had felt like a dream. We had been called in by NASA and briefed on a ‘secret mission’ to be kept hidden from the public. We were to scout out the planet Anubis, 13,000 light years away from the Solar System. It was said to have an atmosphere and ecosystem similar to Earth.

*Just an alternative* they said. *In case Earth goes boom.*

Which was a nice way to say that Earth would be dead in 100 years or more. No wonder no one other than the top scientists wanted anyone to know about this.

*Five…*

*Four…*

Timmy was so excited when we told him we were going on a special trip to space. He wanted to be like his parents, you know. Brave astronauts floating around a rocket ship.

We took him out for lunch and ice cream and to the big museum and tried to enjoy our weekends with him. But as the days folded into weeks and weeks into months, my heart ached with worry. We left him with Pandora’s parents—his face lit up when he saw them and knew he would be spoiled like a little prince. 

I wondered what Timmy was doing now. It was always hard being away from my son for so long—even though it had only been a few hours.

Pandora squeezed my hand again. I turned to look at her and knew she was thinking the same thing.

“We’ll get back home safe,” she said quietly. “And we will be heroes. And Timmy will be so, so proud.”

*Three…*

“Yeah,” I replied. I was crying again. At least my wife was with me. Better Pandora than some random astronaut that I had to quickly befriend over the months of gruelling training.

*Two…*

*One…*

We were thrust backwards into our seats as the rocket shot into the air. Clouds plummeted outside the window like little white hailstones. My teeth were chattering, and my heart felt like it was going to jump out of my mouth.

Azure sky gave way to deep indigo, and wisps of clouds spun around our ship like a thin thread. As we finally burst out of the Earth’s atmosphere, I started to feel excited. Space always felt magical to me, even as a boy, and even now I felt like I was off to some grand adventure.

But then everything soon fell silent, and my excitement was gone as quickly as it had appeared. All that was left now was a cold fear that made my spine tremble. I stared at the vast emptiness around us that seemed to swallow our tiny rocket ship. 

I could hear Pandora humming behind me as she checked the machinery again. I returned my gaze to the blinking computers and the forefront of the ship, gripping the rudder with white-knuckled hands.

***

We were getting closer.

I could feel it in my bones. The radar seemed to agree with me, the red dot blinking rapidly in the southwest of the map. I strained my eyes, searching for the planet that would bring us all salvation.

*Smash!*

The ship spun rapidly on the starboard side, the hull scraping against the rocks. Pandora grunted behind me, her head banging into something. I grit my teeth and struggled for control.

Another asteroid slammed into the other side and sirens started wailing. Pandora shot me a panicked look and crawled to the engine room. I heard her swear as she feverishly tried to hold the ship together.

The light was beating like a pulse, and my eyes started to water. Rocks were hurtling past me and the ship, and my palms were sweating as I navigated against the storm. But what chilled me to the bone wasn’t that I was going to die out here, crushed by asteroids that battered the ship if they swerved too near.

No.

The asteroids were flying faster than normal. Fleeing like wild, panicked animals. 

A stampede.

*And we were going straight towards whatever it was.*

“Engines are down,” Pandora reported. She looked tired, grime and sweat plastering her face. She glanced at the display again. “We’re losing power.”

“Buckle up,” I replied. I jerked the rudder to the left, sending the ship spinning again. “This isn’t going to be pretty.”

The moment I finished speaking, a third asteroid smashed into the centre of the windshield. Spiderweb cracks crept outwards, and then the reinforced glass shattered and the asteroid tumbled in.

Right into Pandora’s face. The sound of her body thudding on the ground made me sick.

**ALL SYSTEMS DOWN**

The lights went off.

*Oh shit*

We were spiralling out of control, and I was flung everywhere like socks in a washing machine. I could see Anubis up close, a glowing pink ball. More asteroids raced past it and battered our already bruised ship.

*One hundred metres.*

I didn’t bother trying to go in for a smooth landing. I crawled over and hugged my wife tight. If I was going to die here, at least I was going to die with her.

*Fifty metres.*

At this elevation, I could see the top of the trees. Tall, thin and too skinny, dancing to a breeze only they could hear.

*Twenty metres.*

An arrow flew into the ship. The tip was tinged with green.

It sank into my leg.

Everything went black.

***

*Squish, squish, squish, squish…*

Footsteps.

Yet they didn’t sound like footsteps. It was more of somebody wading through slime.

I cracked my eyes open and groaned. Pandora peered down at me. She smiled weakly as she helped me to my feet. Her face was cracked, like a porcelain doll, blood slipping in through the cracks. A leaf patch hung over her left eye.

I squirmed and looked away. We were in some kind of cage made of wood or bamboo. It was only big enough for the two of us and a little bit of space to move around. It swung slowly, left and right, like a pendulum, and the drop opened up into gaping darkness.

*Squish squish squish squish…*

The only source of light we had was blocked by a shadow, and a chill ran up my spine when I saw what the captor looked like. He was taller than me and Pandora combined, and twice as wide. He had green skin and long, sharp horns that gleamed like a knife’s blade. He turned and glared at us, his single eye popping with webs of veins.

I shrank back, my heart pounding against my chest. Pandora was as still as a stone. She glared.

It reached through the cage and tickled her face. Then it laughed and sauntered away.

I let out the breath I had been holding for the past few minutes or so. 

*Damn…*

“There’s a ledge over there,” Pandora whispered. Her voice was tight. Scratchy. Like she had been sick for days.

I eyed the ledge, hidden behind a curtain of shadow. The bars were just wide enough that we could just squeeze through, one after the other. But then I thought of the guard and my courage shrank.

“We just have to wait,” I said nervously.

That was easier said than done. Time passed—although we did not know how much. Pandora spent her time staring longingly at the ledge. Sometimes I would join her; other times I would lie on the floor listening to the silence.

That was the thing about that cavern. The silence. No noise whatsoever, save for the breathing from me or my wife. It was so quiet my ears started to ring, and sometimes if I stared hard enough, I saw things. Tiny lizards crawling from the darkness and back again. Colours—red and pink and white— that flashed on and off like distress signals. Eyes that opened up on the rocks around us, with blood-red pupils that hissed and stared back, unblinking.

I couldn’t close my eyes then. I was paralysed.

After some time, I just couldn’t take it any longer. The eyes seemed to creep closer, and once I swore a shadow of something was lying on my wife while she slept, those big red eyes watching me all the while.

I woke Pandora up. “We’ve got to go. Now.”

Pandora rubbed her eyes. They were everywhere, their gaze boring down on my back as I spoke.

We came to a silent agreement then, locking eyes with each other. I glanced once again at the ledge, and the drop that threatened to swallow me up if I failed. As luck would have it, the guards were gone. Probably for a break; probably for a snack.

I sincerely hoped it wasn’t the latter.

It was a tight squeeze, but I gritted my teeth and reached out for the ledge, hauling myself to the top. As I bent down to help Pandora across I heard it come back.

My blood froze.

It was muttering to itself.

“Feast…”

“Sacrifice…”

“All-Mother…”

The cries echoed around the village as we navigated an endless maze of tunnels. We passed by the kitchen at some point and it smelled like heaven. I dared to peek in through the doors. The natives were everywhere, adding spices and strange blue herbs to silver pots. It made my mouth water, but then they started to chant.

“Rejoice in the All-Mother! The Great Feast awaits!”

That made me sick again. It took all my willpower not to vomit in the corridors.

At last, we came to a great stone door, and with great effort we managed to push it open. Then we collapsed into the world outside.

Dawn was starting to break, and the morning sky shone bright with streaks of orange and pink. Pandora fiddled with the communicator on her spacesuit, trying to contact ground control now that we were outdoors. I sank into the soft, pink ground, sighing as it swaddled me like a giant marshmallow.

Pandora swore. “Can’t get a signal,” she mused. “Something blocking it.”

I eyed the pyramid opposite me, transfixed. I had just noticed it and now it held my gaze like a magnet.

“That maybe.”

Imagine if the Great Pyramid of Giza is twenty feet tall. Now imagine it upside-down, coloured pink and with legs. That’s the closest I can describe the absurdity in front of me. It rose up above us, blocking out the sun, its little legs wriggling like little worms. But what caught my eye though, wasn’t this strange pyramid glimmering in the morning sun.

No.

It was the mural on the pyramid. It depicted a large woman, but with tentacles instead of legs. Her eyes were closed like she was asleep, but the tentacles told a different story. Half of them were holding fruit—strange blue grapes and purple apples. The other half were curled around screaming natives. 

And humans.

*Us.*

In fact, when I looked closely the humans did resemble *us*. Pandora and I, our faces imprinted deep into the stone. Our expressions shifted from anger to pain to terror.

My skin prickled with cold sweat. I stifled a gasp.

Then I blinked, and the faces looked more *normal*. But every so often the faces would change again, and I wondered if it was due to the effects of Anubis’ atmosphere or if it was because of my fear scratching into the primal part of my brain.

The chills running havoc throughout my blood made me conclude it was the latter.

Pandora cried out, and I turned to see her held back by some of the guards. We were so mesmerized by the pyramid and the painting that we forgot we were supposed to *run away*.

We locked eyes again. She screamed at me to run. Her face beaded with sweat.

I obeyed. I ran.

And ran.

And ran.

It was only when the soft pink mud came halfway to my knees then I stopped. I seemed to be in some sort of rainforest or jungle. Thin trees huddled in close as if providing warmth and comfort to each other. The sky was a puddle up above, only letting a little light illuminate the way out in a long, white arm.

Giant bugs flew by, bugs as big as my arm and square wings bigger than my television screen. I swore and swatted them away, but they kept on coming in droves, shadows that blocked out what little light I had.

A groan echoed throughout the jungle, followed by a roar of anger. A command in a language my communicator could not identify. It sounded raw though. Heavy.

Then I felt myself sinking. Mud quickly rose up to my chest. My legs started to tingle, before quickly growing numb.

The bugs came back. They landed on my head and pressed downwards with all their strength. The pink mud gurgled like a witches’ cauldron and began to swirl.

*This jungle is eating me alive.*

**YOU ARE MINE. YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY.**

The voice echoed throughout the jungle. It was the same voice from before, that raw, heavy, ominous voice. It was then followed by a laugh that sent shivers up and down my spine.

But those shivers were accompanied by resolve.

Getting out of here.

Freeing my wife.

Seeing my son.

I pushed through the mud with the last of my strength. It wasn't easy, like pulling a heavy cart behind me. The bugs made it worse—they were everywhere, buzzing in front of my face. Blinding me.

I yanked myself out of that jungle and collapsed onto dry land.

My communicator beeped. For some reason, *now* I got a signal.

“Ground Control to Team Nook. What is going on?”

“We need pick-up from Anubis,” I replied. The afternoon was fading fast, and the moon was rising. Bright and full, like a wheel of cheese.

*How does time move so quickly in this place?*

“We’ll send a reinforcement spacecraft over. How is your wife?”

I swallowed and immediately hung up. I didn’t want to answer that question.

In the distance, I could see smoke billowing into the cool evening. Flames dancing on thin logs. The rhythmic beat of a drum.

*Boom boom. Boom boom.*

And somebody was screaming. Charred flesh.

*Pandora…*

The ground rumbled below me, and the dry rocks heaved. Pink chains erupted from down below and locked around my wrists. Then the ground bent downwards into a slope—and I shot down the newly-made hill at the speed of light.

As I neared the village I could hear them chanting, every word making the hair on my skin bristle. One of them was dressed in a blood-stained robe. Its face was painted white; its single eye was outlined crimson. It turned and knelt in front of the pyramid, which glowed under the dancing flame.

I collided with the priest. It coughed in surprise and collapsed.

**YOU FAILED TO BRING ME BOTH OUTSIDERS. THIS IS THE OTHER ONE.**

The light was blinding. I squeezed my eyes tight. I could still see it though through my closed eyelids, a giant sphere of fire. Everyone was down on their knees now, sobbing. Some were praying to be spared.

**YOU WILL BE PUNISHED.**

I tried to look away. But something was keeping me there; something was making me watch. Projecting what was going on into my brain and making me squirm.

The natives were melting like candle wax, their green skin dripping to the ground.  Their eyes were wide. Petrified. They were screaming until my ears rang.

Green puddles crept to my toes, mixed with something black which I assumed to be blood.

The only survivors standing were those that were still pregnant, and they fell to their knees and wept for their dead. Then the call came again, ringing like the bell, and the heavens shook. The pyramid opened and the ground tilted and threw me inside.

Then all was quiet again.

***

Pandora was there, waiting for me.

But yet it wasn’t the Pandora I knew.

Her legs were gone, the skin and flesh picked clean from the bone and thrown to the side. Her chest was ripped open, arteries and veins popping out like loose wires, her heart dangling to the side. All of her hair was gone, and she smiled at me with whatever was left of her face, the parts that weren't burned or shredded into pieces. Recognition. Relief. Loss.

It pained me to see my wife like this. I forced myself to look away.

And then I saw the rocket.

It was made out of a patchwork of skin and flesh, all stitched together with sinew and thin threads of dried blood. It was decorated with skulls—human and alien skulls alike that might have once stepped onto this cursed land.

I gulped. I didn’t know Pandora and I was not the first one. That knowledge alone filled me with dread.

The pyramid opened up, and the sphere of light flew through and morphed into Her in all Her tentacled glory. She towered over us and hissed, and a forked tongue darted out and tasted the air.

I shrank back against the wall, hugging Pandora like a stuffed teddy bear. I could still hear what was left of her heart beating. How she was still alive at this point was beyond me.

My own heart was pounding right along with hers.

The All-Mother laughed at my fear, her tongue continuously flicking back and forth like a snake’s. She grinned, basking in her joke, and as I shrank away when she reached out for us she cackled once again in joy.

Then she turned away and examined the makeshift rocket. She shook her head. Stamped her foot. Screamed.

**NOT ENOUGH! NOT ENOUGH!**

She reached out for us—to me—rather, and her tentacles morphed into gleaming blades and I swallowed…

*I’m going to die.*

*Right here, right now.*

The ground rumbled again, followed by a screech that ripped the earth apart—literally. The pyramid was collapsing into itself, giant rocks littering the ground.

Euphoria turned into fear. Haunted shadows danced into her eyes.

*Squish squish squish.*

She had locked herself into her rocket. I heard her howl. It sounded primal as always, but it felt different somehow. 

No power. No authority.

Just pure terror.

**IT COMES! TOO LATE!*

The rocks were flying upwards. The sky was swirling in a violet whirlpool, and everything was being sucked into its gaping mouth, lined with teeth. Asteroids rushed past, panicking, the slower ones crashing, exhausted to the ground.

Then it disappeared into an unseen mouth.

A giant red eye opened wide and glared down at us.

I was paralysed. I gripped my wife tight.

My communicator crackled.

“We’re here. Where is your location?”

I stared worriedly at the beast above us swallowing everything whole. Shadowy hands darted down and grabbed everything they could reach, just missing us huddling in the corner.

“Coming,” I croaked, and forced my frozen muscles to move.

Dragging Pandora behind me I began to run. Up above I could see the All-Mother’s rocket, and its shadowy hands ripped it apart like chicken meat and stuffed it into its mouth. Her dying screams made the hair on my skin stand on end.

As I got into the rescue craft I swore The Eye belonging to the beast turned, its red gaze staring us down. 

*Oh crap.*

“We’ve got to move!” I screamed, and the pilot grit his teeth and the engines coughed with life. He pushed it as hard as he could, darting quickly around the fleeing asteroids, and I heard the beast groan as it swiped at us.

But then its hand sprung back, and it eyed the planet once more. One moment Anubis was there; the next it was gone, swallowed up by this gaping darkness with a ruby eye, and as we sped away quickly it blinked slowly back at us, and my heart stopped again in my chest.

***
Last year I spent a few terrifying nights on the planet Anubis with my dear wife.

This year I spent my time alone on Earth with my only son.

It was hard. Really hard. Pandora didn’t make it. The first thing we did when we got back to Earth was to rush her to the field hospital in the space centre, but she was there only for a few minutes before her breathing gave out and her heart stopped forever.

I was there in her final moments, holding her hand, telling her how brave she was. Sobbing. Her funeral was heartbreaking. 

I had a feeling it was my fault too. I couldn’t bear to see my in-laws again. And little Timmy—poor boy. Lost his mother at the tender age of five.

So I wanted answers. It was the only way I could have justice, the only way I could give my dear wife some closure. But the government databases were wiped clean. Nothing about Anubis, nothing at all. Even the conspiracy websites didn’t have it, let alone the mainstream media.

It was like Anubis did not exist.

It was like our mission to Anubis did not exist.

And when I try to warn them, tell them about Anubis’ demise, they tell me to shut up, no matter how hard I try to escalate it. They do it in cold sweat, their faces pale and trembling, their eyes darting to and fro, like the name is poisonous to those who invoke it.

*It doesn’t exist,* they whisper. *There is no planet called Anubis.*

I almost bought it myself. Better to honour my dear wife the best I could, and put the past in the past. Better to block out everything to do with Anubis. Ignore the threats and live my life in bliss.

But tonight, as I took my dear Timmy out to the garden with his toy telescope, I saw—for just a split second— the sky open up and an eye blink.

Red as blood.

My blood runs cold.

I know it is still out there. Somewhere.

Waiting.
