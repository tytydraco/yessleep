— *Elizabeth, what did you think of the Amazon rainforest exploration?* I asked, trying to break the silence.

— *It was the best experience I’ve ever had, Geovani. I never imagined there were so many incredible animals. But...* — she paused, frowning. — *The only thing I didn’t like was the mosquitoes. There are so many here in Brazil, it’s impossible to escape them.*

— *Ah, those damn mosquitoes...* — I replied with a bitter laugh, leaning down to scratch my foot. — *Not even repellent gets rid of these pests!*

He looked at his foot and saw the red mark itching like fire. He was already covered in bites, but this one felt different. It was bigger, more swollen, and throbbed as if something were pulsing inside.

— *Are you leaving today, Elizabeth?* — I asked, still scratching the wound, feeling a burning sensation that only got worse.

— *Yes, why, Geovani?* — she asked, flashing that smile that seemed straight out of a dream.

Her blonde hair framed a perfect face, almost unbelievably beautiful. Elizabeth was unlike any other foreigner I’d ever met. There was something about her—something special. She seemed to glow. And me? Well... I think I was in love.

— *What happened last night... doesn’t mean anything to you?* — I dared to ask, my voice almost breaking.

Elizabeth let out a soft laugh, tilting her head gracefully.

— *Oh, Geovani, I can’t believe you took that seriously. It was just one night, sweetie.*

She held my face with her cold, delicate fingers. Then she stepped back, walking toward the Uber that would take her to the Manaus airport. From there, she would fly back to the United States, leaving me behind.

— *Bye, sweetie,* she said, with that English accent that made my head spin.

I stood there for a moment, watching the car disappear into the distance. I sighed. Deep down, I knew this was inevitable. But I couldn’t shake the feeling of loss. Elizabeth was like a comet passing through my life.

While driving through the streets of Manaus on my way home, my thoughts were still on her. But I was soon dragged back to reality by the damn itch. My foot burned like fire. I had to rub my heel against the car mat as I drove.

When I finally got home, I lay in bed that night, still thinking about Elizabeth. The way she smiled, her scent... It was as if everything about her had been designed to enchant me. But the itch. Oh, the itch... It just wouldn’t stop.

I spent hours trying to sleep, but I couldn’t. My fingers kept scratching the skin on my heel, but nothing eased the sensation. The mark, once just a mosquito bite, now looked redder, harder.

Around three in the morning, I finally gave up on sleep. I got up and went to the bathroom. I grabbed a bottle of alcohol and poured it directly onto the wound, hoping it would help.

— *Damn allergy...* — I muttered angrily, as the burning sensation crawled up my leg.

Looking into the mirror, I saw sweat dripping down my face while the cold liquid brought momentary relief.

The next morning, I woke up to find the bite even bigger, as if a small ball were growing on my foot. I ran my hand over the wound and felt its texture: hard, inflamed, almost hot.

The itch—oh my God, the itch... You have no idea. It was as if that little bump was the very fire of hell trapped beneath my skin. I poured more alcohol on it. It brought some relief. But as I tried to get ready for work, I noticed something was different. The wound throbbed, and the burning sensation was now accompanied by sharp stings that came and went, like tiny electric shocks.

I’m a tour guide, helping tourists discover what they can and can’t do in the Amazon. That’s how I met Elizabeth.

I got to work, but the discomfort was unbearable. The stings kept getting worse. At first, they felt like mild shocks, then like deep needle pricks. By the time I made it back home that night, my foot felt like it was on fire. The small bump I had noticed that morning had grown. A lot.

I considered going to the doctor, but the thought of spending the whole day at the hospital, only to be told it was “just a tropical allergy,” discouraged me.

— *If it gets worse, I’ll go tomorrow,* I told myself, trying to sound convincing.

That night, the pain intensified. The stabbing sensation felt like it was reaching the bone. It was horrible—like something was biting my flesh from the inside. I ran my hand over the wound and felt the hard texture, almost as if there was something solid under the skin.

My heart froze when I noticed a slight movement.

Something was alive in there.

— *A goddamn botfly...* — I muttered, my voice trembling.

Everyone’s heard stories about botflies: flies that lay their eggs under the skin, with larvae growing and feeding on flesh. But this... this felt different.

I grabbed some tweezers and alcohol, went to the bathroom, and sat on the floor. I looked up at the shower above me, the dark glass of the shower stall reflecting the dim bathroom light. Through the window, I saw the pitch-black night, the moon hanging like a silent witness.

I pressed around the swollen area. A sharp pain exploded—like needles stabbing straight into my foot. I kept pressing, even as tears rolled down my face. The wound started turning purple, with dark edges.

And then... it burst.

The smell that came out of it was indescribable. A stench of rot mixed with something worse—like death itself. The bathroom filled with the reek, making my stomach churn.

From the hole, tiny larvae began crawling out—thousands of them, wriggling over my foot.

I doused them in alcohol while screaming, watching them squirm and drop to the floor. But there was a bigger one. I grabbed it with the tweezers, and when I squeezed it to kill it, the smell intensified.

I felt nauseous but kept cleaning. The itching stopped for a moment, but the hole in my foot was now enormous, exposing red muscle and thin, necrotic tissue along the edges.

I saw something white.

Bone.

I moved my big toe and watched the bone shift inside the wound. My whole body trembled. I nearly passed out right there.

After hours of trying to clean it, I wrapped the wound in bandages and applied ointment.

In the following days, I kept working, but the smell worsened. Even with fresh bandages, the stench of rot seemed to seep through everything. People began to notice.

Tourists complained.

Flies started appearing, drawn to my leg.

Eventually, my supervisor had enough. He fired me, saying it was impossible to keep a tour guide who “reeked of death.”

At home, I peeled back the bandage in the bathroom. The smell that escaped nearly made me vomit.

It was horrible.

A stench of decay, like sewage mixed with rotting meat.

I stepped back, holding my breath, but I had to look.

In the center of the hole, something was moving.

Larvae—small and white—began crawling out, writhing across my skin like worms on a corpse.

I poured alcohol on them. The smell grew worse, as if the larvae released even more rot when touched by the liquid.

Some died immediately.

Others fled, crawling across the bathroom floor.

I grabbed the tweezers and pulled out a larger one. When I squeezed it, it burst between my fingers, releasing a black, viscous liquid that smelled like pure sewage.

I re-bandaged the hole and went back to bed, trying to ignore the stench now clinging to every corner of my house.

But in the following days, things became unbearable.

 

The bandage, which I changed daily, became soaked with a yellowish-green liquid oozing from the wound. It started attracting flies—dozens of them, not just one or two. They constantly hovered around my foot, trying to get under the bandage. Their buzzing drove me insane. They seemed to know exactly where the smell was coming from.

But that night, when I got home, the wound revealed just how bad things had become.

As I removed the bandage, now yellowed and stiff with pus, I was hit by the most horrible smell I had ever experienced. It was like feces mixed with rotting meat. The wound had spread across my heel, with blackened edges and exposed flesh. Tiny muscles pulsed at the edges, and in the center... worms. Thousands of them.

Some were dead, dried out by the alcohol, but many were still moving, crawling over the raw flesh.

I poured more alcohol. The liquid soaked into the open wound, and the pain was so unbearable that I collapsed to my knees. I watched as the larvae writhed, some trying to escape, while others simply died, releasing a greenish liquid.

From deep within the wound, something larger emerged.

A thick, white worm with red spots. It crawled out slowly, as if reluctant to leave its shelter. I grabbed it with the tweezers and crushed it.

Flies swarmed the bathroom as I tried to clean the mess. They wouldn’t stop circling the wound; some even tried to land directly inside the open hole. I tried to shoo them away, but it was useless.

That night, I lay down with my body exhausted and my mind in pieces. But I couldn’t rest.

The itching came back—this time on my head.

I reached up and felt something hard and swollen.

A new wound.

When I woke up, the wound on my foot was wide open. The smell? Worse than ever. I ordered an Uber—I couldn’t drive. The driver clearly noticed the smell but said nothing.

And the flies... my God, the flies!

Thousands of them, trying to burrow into the wound, swarming over the fresh bandages I had barely managed to put on.

When I arrived at the hospital, the scene was the same as always: an endless line. The public hospital system never disappoints.

I went straight to the nurse.

— *I need help. It’s an emergency.*

She barely looked up at me:

— *We can’t let just anyone in. There are children, women, and elderly people ahead of you.*

That fat bitch spoke like I was there for fun. *"You think anyone comes to this hellhole because they like it?"* I thought, but swallowed the words.

— *I really need help. I think I’m losing my foot.*

She sighed, as if my presence was a personal offense.

— *Let me see.*

She left the triage area, acting like some kind of savior. It wasn’t even her job to look at wounds, but one glance was enough. She didn’t even need to get close.

The smell of rot coming from my foot hit her like a punch in the face.

The bandage was infested.

Flies buzzed everywhere, starving. The bandages? I could hardly look at them.

Soaked, heavy, stained with a dark brown and greenish hue, like something rotting from the inside. Some parts had hardened into a disgusting crust, while others were pure liquid, slowly dripping.

The flies danced in circles around my foot—hundreds, no, thousands of them. Some landed, walking with those filthy legs over the damp fabric, others forcing their way into the gaps between the loose gauze.

One fly went straight for the nurse’s face; she swatted it away in panic.

— *Go in! Jesus... How did you let it get this bad? Disgusting!*

She spoke to me like I was a mangy dog, as if my existence itself was offensive.

I swallowed the lump in my throat—only because I didn’t have the strength to argue. Like I said, no one comes to a public hospital like this unless they’re desperate.

The endless lines, the unbearable heat, and the staff who treat you worse than garbage.

The woman—fat, around 30—stormed off, huffing like I’d committed a crime. She complained loudly, her mocking tone making it seem like everything was my fault.

I was there, begging for help, and she acted like I was the worst human being on earth. I had never felt so humiliated.

When she reached the entrance, she stopped to whisper to a colleague. I saw them glance back at me with disgust.

The other nurse pinched her nose, and I heard her say:

— *Gross. How does someone let it get that bad?*

My blood boiled. I couldn’t take it anymore.

— *If no one helps me, I’ll sue all of you for human rights violations!*

My voice cracked—I was crying now.

Tears streamed down my face while people nearby looked at me with disgust.

Some covered their mouths and noses, trying to escape the stench spreading through the air.

That suffocating heat of Manaus, combined with the hellish atmosphere of the public hospital, made it feel like I had shit my pants. Finally, after 20 minutes of humiliation and judgmental stares, a nurse appeared. She called me into the emergency ward. I dragged myself there, feeling the weight of everyone’s eyes burning into my back.

I entered the examination room and sat on the bed. The nurse, young, with her hair pulled tightly into a bun, tried to maintain professionalism, but I could see it on her face—disgust.

— *What happened to you?*  
She asked cautiously, approaching as if handling a ticking time bomb.

— *Geovani. My name is Geovani...*  
I spoke softly, scratching my head without realizing it. The automatic gesture reminded me of another problem: dandruff. I was probably covered in it. I placed my hand on my head, as if that would somehow make me look less miserable.

— *It started with a damn mosquito bite. I thought it was a botfly... But it turned into this.*  
I pointed to my foot.

She looked—and I saw her face twitch as she tried not to react to the smell. I couldn’t blame her. The gauze was worse now, practically dissolving in pus and blood.

— *Do you have a history of diabetes?* — she asked, her voice nearly indifferent but still keeping her distance, as if I were contagious.

— *No. Never had.*

— *We’ll run a test.*  
She grabbed the equipment and worked quickly, avoiding any unnecessary contact.

When the result came in:  
— *Negative for diabetes.*

Before she could say more, the doctor entered the room.

Tall, thin, wearing a white coat completely unsuitable for the suffocating heat. He stepped in—but the smell hit him immediately. I saw the exact moment he stopped, hand flying to cover his nose as he muttered:

— *Holy God... What the hell is this?*

Even with his hand partially covering his nose, he had to take a step back when he saw my foot.

The wound was now completely open, like a bottomless pit. The edges were blackened and shriveled, as though burned. Pus slowly oozed out, mixing with old blood.

In the middle of it all—the larvae.

Some were small and fast, burrowing deeper, searching for more flesh. Others, however, were massive, the size of thumbs. They twisted slowly, seemingly satisfied, fat from devouring what was left of my foot.

The gauze I had applied earlier was soaked and falling apart, dissolving into pieces. Flies still buzzed, drawn to the wound, some landing on the decomposing tissue clumped at the edges.

The doctor forced himself to look. He leaned in, examining the wound’s details, discomfort painted across his face.

When he saw what was happening along the edges, he lost some of his composure.

— *I think we’ll have to cut it off...*

Those words hit me like a punch. My heart pounded. My vision blurred.

I looked at my leg—at what was left of it. I could see the black patch crawling upward.

— *We’re sedating you now. This is urgent.*

That was the last thing I heard before everything went dark. — *What the hell is this? Have you ever seen anything like this before, nurse?*

The nurse, pale and visibly disgusted, answered curtly:  
— *You’re the doctor. You should know.*

He shook his head, sweating beneath his mask, muttering almost to himself:  
— *Never in my life have I seen an infestation like this. The worms... damn, I swear one of them is bigger than my dick.*

The doctor tried to compose himself.

They positioned Geovani’s leg and began the procedure. They had decided to amputate the part infested by the larvae.

The smell was unbearable—something so foul it seemed to cling to the air, invading noses, throats, and stomachs.

The nurse couldn’t take it; she took two steps back and vomited against the wall, clutching it for balance.

The doctor took a deep breath and started with a small incision, trying to minimize the damage.

But as soon as the surgical blade touched the flesh—everything collapsed.

The decayed flesh simply gave way, like a sack bursting open.

Worms—fat, slick, and squirming—spilled out onto the floor.

They buzzed and writhed as though being set free.

Some, enormous, crawled across the floor like snakes.

Others squirmed mid-air, spreading the putrid stench further throughout the room.

— *My God...* — the doctor murmured, feeling his stomach churn. — *This is worse than anything I’ve ever seen.*

The larvae were unbelievably large, some as long as fingers, others even bigger.

Every time the doctor tried to cut away more dead tissue, it seemed as though the worms emerged from the flesh on their own.

When the leg was finally amputated, the doctor paused, glancing at the rest of Geovani’s body.

That’s when he noticed something that left him even more horrified.

— *Nurse, look at this. On his head.*

She hesitated but couldn’t ignore him.

When the doctor pushed back Geovani’s hair, both of them recoiled at the same time.

Among the strands of hair, thousands of tiny larvae writhed, moving together like worms feeding on a corpse.

 

A living, pulsating mass. Every time the doctor pushed back more hair, more larvae fell—some small, others already growing, clinging to the scalp.

— *Holy God…* — the nurse muttered, trembling as she tried to stay professional.

The doctor took a deep breath, but when he looked behind Geovani’s ear, he broke down.

The tissue around the ear had been completely devoured. Flesh was gone, revealing the white of the skull, which the worms were slowly eating away.

He couldn’t hold it together. The smell, the sight—everything made him vomit right there, doubled over the sink.

— *We don’t have a surgeon for this. We need a second opinion, fast… There’s no way I can handle this here.*

But he knew there wasn’t time.

Reluctantly, he moved closer to Geovani’s head, the nurse beside him clutching a used vomit bag.

With gloved fingers, he pushed aside hair matted with sweat and dirt.

Thousands of tiny larvae began spilling onto the floor, flowing like a living wave.

They were different from the massive ones that had emerged from the leg—small, but just as active, wriggling in every direction as if searching for more flesh.

When he began using the scalpel and surgical saw, the dead flesh around the skull slid off almost on its own, disintegrating like wet paper.

As he made the incision and lifted the top of the skull,

the inside was crawling with worms.

Thousands—maybe millions—moved among the folds of the brain, already partially devoured.

The larger larvae were monstrous, nearly the size of small snakes, gliding lazily. The smaller ones moved quickly, devouring

The smell that escaped was indescribable.

The doctor and nurse recoiled at the same time, coughing and gagging.

— *This… this is pure sewage,* — gasped the nurse, tears welling in her eyes from the stench.

The doctor tried to grab one of the larger worms, but it slipped through his gloved fingers—slick and slimy—falling to the floor with a wet *plop*.

When he looked again, he realized he could feel the brain pulsating through the glove. The worms were moving with such intensity that the entire organ seemed to throb.

— *He’s not dead, but… he’s done for.*

The nurse vomited again, collapsing beside the examination table.

As she stumbled back, she slipped on something—the mixture of blood, pus, and larvae now covering the floor.

— *Nurse, clean this up!* — the doctor shouted, trying to regain control.

— *That’s not my job!* — she screamed back, voice thick with disgust and desperation.

— *Clean it NOW, or I’ll call your supervisor! CLEAN IT!*

Trembling, she obeyed.

The doctor grabbed the phone in the next room, dialing the disease control center in Manaus.

— *This is something I’ve never seen before. We’ve got an urgent case. Worms… I don’t even know how to describe it. Just get here.*

They promised to arrive by 3 p.m.

As the doctor returned to the operating room, he heard the nurse screaming.

She had been trying to clean the larvae off the floor, but they seemed to move too fast, clinging to her gloves and crawling up her arms.

The doctor knew this was just the beginning.

He looked at Geovani’s body, still breathing—though there wasn’t much left to save.  — *Mommy, my arm itches.*

— *I’ll put some ointment on it after school, sweetheart.*

— *Okay, Mommy.*

I took Kaio’s hand, and we headed toward the car.

As we walked, something caught my eye: Geovani’s house.

It had been empty for days. The windows were shut; everything looked abandoned.

*“What could have happened to him?”* I wondered, but I quickly shifted my focus back to Kaio, who had started whining again.

When I got into the car to take Kaio to school, I noticed something unusual through the window.

A group of military personnel had arrived at Geovani’s house.

There was strange activity; their truck blocked half the street.

My stomach tightened.

But I ignored it and continued with our routine.

— *Mommy, my arm hurts. It feels like something’s biting me!*

I glanced at Kaio quickly.

He was scratching his arm furiously. The skin looked slightly red.

— *It’s just an itch, baby. It’ll go away. We’ll put some ointment on when you get back from school.*

I tried to reassure him, but as I spoke, I felt a strange itch on my own leg.

Discreetly, I placed my hand on my thigh and felt it—

A small, hard bump.

A bite, maybe. Probably just an allergy. Nothing to worry about.

I looked at Kaio again in the rearview mirror.

He kept scratching his arm—relentlessly.
