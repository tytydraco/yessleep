So yesterday I met up with a few friends and we decided to play tourists in New Orleans. We all grew up in the area, but none of had ever done like the haunted New Orleans tours and we thought it would be a fun night out so we got a room in quarter and went out.

When we finally made our way to the place where the tours started, for some reason, there were a lot of people waiting. I guess because it's Thanksgiving week and people are coming in for the holidays and getting ready for the game next weekend. While we we clowning waiting for a guide to be available, this guy walks up and asks if we were ready.

We paid him and started following him through the quarter past some shops listening and laughing.  He started bringing us down some streets that couldn't be on the tour telling us about stuff haunting in different parts of the city and their history. It was  quirky but fun. He was telling us he could tell we were locals, so he was showing us the real thing, not tourists traps.

So we walk into this old shotgun house, and we see a lady sitting in the middle of a circle of salt. He tells us she is a medium and can let us talk to the dead as long as she is in the circle. 

Her eyes locked on my friend, and she started talking, but she sounds just like my friends brother, who was killed in the 7th ward last year. My blood ran cold. He tells us everything that happened that night through this lady. I started recording it when my friend accidently knocked my phone out of my hand, and it fell inside the circle. 

Like I said, I grew up around here, so I know a circle of salt is for protection, and I wasn't stepping across it for a phone. It was staying there. That is until the lady stood up, came to the edge and smiled, and pushed my phone out to me. 

That's when things got... interesting. Everything around us changed. We were standing on the porch of a white boarded up house. The markings from Katrina were still on the door showing the house had been searched and 2 were found inside. Everything around us was abandoned houses. But we didn't remember coming this way or walking this far. My other friend called Uber, and we headed back to the hotel. 

We were talking about everything and trying to figure out what happened. Then I remembered the recording  yall it was her brother we saw being held in chains by the old woman. There was a dark void behind her and light going from us to the tour guide and from him to her. The moment she slid my phone across the salt, there was an explosion of light before everything went dark. I didn't even remember picking my phone up.

We sat there in silence all of a sudden we could hear her laughing in the room. She said this is about to get fun.
I don't know what she means. My friends left hours ago to find the house. I'm sitting here in a circle of salt on Google, trying to figure out what to do. Can anyone help? She's sitting outside the circle staring at me.
