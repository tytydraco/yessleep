You know those websites on the Internet that offer you to answer questions in exchange for a few cents most of the time?

If you answered "yes", it's  probably because, like me, you've found yourself in such a bind that you've had to do this kind of things to finish the month.

Up until now, I've been taking these quizzes from time to time in the afternoon, often after screwing up yet another job interview on Zoom.

When my roommate left, and my rent doubled, things got worse.

After two months of unpaid rent, and letters from debt collectors arriving every week, I started to panic.

I ended up using a VPN to navigate safely on the Dark Web in search of easy money.

That's how one evening I came across an ad that intrigued me.

I was sitting on my sofa in my living room with my laptop on me.

It had been posted by an anonymous user and read: "Test our new online Escape Game "Master of the Key", $3,000 guaranteed for each participant - Test duration: about 30 minutes".

The ad had been posted just 10 minutes ago, so I had a good chance of being among the first to see it.

There was nothing else written on the ad apart from a link to click on to sign up.

I moved the arrow on my laptop, then hesitated.

It just seemed too good to be true. But Jake, my old roommate who'd talked to me and introduced me to the dark web when he still lived here, told me that this kind of ad was actually quite common.

Generally speaking, the amount of the payment was multiplied by 10 compared to what one could expect in a legal context. So $3,000 seemed generous, but not excessive.

Of course, what worried me most was what I was going to be asked to do.

These ads, after all, paid well for a good reason: they involved illegal or unethical activities most of the time.

Without realizing it, I had put my feet on the floor, and the computer on the small table in front of me. Right next to the computer, I could see dunning letters for unpaid bills.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and finally told myself that after all, this was just an online test and I could always stop the experiment by turning off my computer.

I clicked on the link.

Instantly a new window opened and I found myself in a chat room.

A few seconds later, a message appeared.

"*Good evening, thank you for registering for our brand new Escape Game "Master of the Key", I'm L, your Game Master. Your participation will be validated once the first trial has started. Are you ready to start?*"

It was so sudden that I felt a shot of adrenalin coursing through my body.

"*Good evening, is it possible to do the test later? I hadn't planned for it to start right away*" I replied, so that I could at least have time to prepare myself mentally.

The answer was almost immediate.

"*If you don't take the test now, another participant will take your place, and as the number of places is limited, you'll certainly lose the right to participate, and with it, the sum provided in exchange, i.e. $3,000.*"

Again, I took a deep breath and I answered.

"*Okay, I accept to participate right now. I'll let you explain what the game is all about.*"

"*Congratulations, your participation has been validated.*

*The game is simple, you have to get out of your apartment in less than 5 minutes from the start of the game, which will be given to you later.*"

I raised my eyebrows, was this a joke?

"*To begin the game, please retrieve the red key which is located in the room you are currently in.*"

I rested my back against the sofa, and looked around. There was nothing strange, my living room dimly lit by two lamps was still the same and I couldn't see anything different. And how could it be different anyway? I'd only just registered, so there was no way someone could have had time to find my address and break in to drop off a key.

"*Are you sure I haven't missed a step? I've never been given a red key.*"

"*The key is in the room, you just have to look around a bit, that's part of the game. Once you've found it, take a photo of it and send it to this chat to prove you've passed the first trial.*"

The person in the chat room seemed so sure of themself that, stupid as it may sound, I got up and started looking around for a red key. I thought maybe this was an experiment to see if I could find the right objects, and that any red key would do.

I looked in all the drawers for an old key and found one but, not red of course.

Just as I was about to go out and ask my neighbors if they had a can of red paint somewhere, I noticed a strange reflection near the ceiling.

Right next to the light bulb on my ceiling was a red key suspended by a small cord.

I stared at my computer screen in amazement. The chat window was still there, with no new message.

I untied the cord and retrieved the key after climbing onto a chair.

I couldn't believe what was happening, it seemed impossible. And yet, there in my hand was a medium-sized, red iron key. It was old, and seemed to exude an unusual coldness on the palm. I don't know if it was my sudden discomfort or the anxiety I was feeling, but I felt as if I could feel it tingling my skin.

I looked up and a strange sensation ran through my body. I felt as if I'd lost the sense of security of being at home, as if something had suddenly changed the moment I touched that key.

I took a picture with my cell phone and sent it to my computer so I could transfer it and send it to the chat.

"*Congratulations! You've passed the first trial.*

*The second trial is the easiest: take the key and use it on the lock of one of your doors. Any door will do, but we'd advise you to use it on the door furthest away from where you currently stand.*"

I'd reached my limit. I don't know what was happening, but I felt like I'd stepped into a dangerous place from which I'd better get out as soon as possible.

"*I'm sorry, but I'm going to stop here. I don't know how you managed to get into my house without me noticing to put that key there, but I've had my fill. Thank you and good-bye.*"

I almost had time to see a reply appear as I closed my computer screen.

I slumped onto my sofa as the pressure began to ease.

I still didn't understand how they'd done it, and if they could do that, what would have been in store for me if I'd continued this game.

It was getting late, and this experience had exhausted me more than I thought. I got up with difficulty and made my way to my bedroom.

Then the lights went out.

I froze. Then slowly, I grabbed my cell phone and used the flashlight to go see if my circuit breaker had just blown.

The circuit-breaker hadn't tripped, everything was normal. So why had my lights gone out?

I headed for my front door to ask my upstairs neighbors if they still had electricity. I turned down the knob and was about to step through, when an icy wind hit me in the face.

It was pitch black outside.

Even the flashlight of my phone couldn't illuminate where the floor or walls of the corridor should have been. There was just nothing, nothing but an immense, cold void.

I was stunned. And I couldn’t help but think that this had to do something with the game.

It didn't make any sense, but it was the only thing I could think of.

I returned to my living room. When I got there, I looked across at the two windows that usually let in the moonlight. It was pitch black, the same as behind my front door. I was alone.

I sat up slowly and reopened my computer screen. Then I saw the message that had been sent to me just before I lowered the screen.

"*You can't stop the game now that it's started, Daniel.*"

I slowly swallowed and replied to the message.

"*What's going on? Who the hell are you? How do you know my name? How are you doing this?*"

No answer.

"*Please leave me, I just want to go home.*"

Writing these lines felt strange, but even though I was still in my apartment, I was definitely not home anymore.

"*Finish the game and you'll be free to go.*"

I looked around me. The darkness was oppressive, barely kept at bay by the light of the computer screen, and my phone's flashlight, and I had the feeling that at any moment something could come out of it and attack me, or worse, drag me with it into the dark.

"*Okay, tell me what to do.*"

"*You know what to do, use the red key, one turn will do.*"

I picked up the red key that had been left on the table next to the computer. The cold sensation had disappeared, as if it were now where it usually was.

I stood up and considered my options. They'd said any door would do, but they'd recommended the one furthest from where I was standing. I figured if I was going to try a door, I might as well try the front door and see if anything changed.

I slowly made my way down the corridor. The silence was disturbed by nothing but the light sound of my footsteps.

Once I reached the door, I picked up the red key with trembling hands. I inserted it into the lock and it went in without a hitch. I turned it. I put my ear to the door, but I couldn't hear anything.

I slowly withdrew it, and opened the door again, praying this time to see the comforting yellow light of my building's corridor.

Night, emptiness, cold. Nothing had changed, I was still lost in the middle of nowhere.

I closed the door and returned to the computer.

"*I did it, I turned the key in the front door lock but nothing happened.*"

I waited feverishly for an answer, biting my nails and looking around anxiously.

"*Congratulations! You can now try out the third and last trial of our escape game. We hope you have strong nerves, because you're going to need them!*"

My heart missed a beat what was going to happen?

A timer appeared on the screen, 5 minutes.

"*You have 5 minutes to find the black key and escape unharmed.*

*Be careful, if the timer reaches 0 and you haven't got out, you'll be stuck here.*

*Good luck!*"

Just as the last message appeared on the screen, I heard the sound of my front door creaking open.

Then slow, dragging footsteps echoed down the corridor to where I was standing.

Another sound reached me, that of someone trying to swallow but unable to.

Breathless, I stood up without making a sound. I didn't know what had broken into my house, but I didn't want to find out.

I began to look around hurriedly, making as little noise as possible. They'd said there was a black key here, so there had to be a key, just like last time.

The footsteps drew closer as I used the last few seconds I had left to use the light on my phone before hiding in the darkness.

I couldn't find anything, there was nothing, no black key. I was going to die here, killed by this thing in the hallway, or worse, I was going to be stuck here forever with it.

A message appeared in the chat window.

"*Tip: It navigates using only its sense of hearing!*"

Just as I finished reading the message, the thing appeared in the room, and I lit it all up.

This thing was straight out of a nightmare.

It looked like a corpse that had started to decompose and then suddenly dried up. It stood awkwardly, as if only part of its body was still functioning. Its arms were bent at an impossible angle and pressed against its back, and above all, its eyelids had been sewn shut to block its entire view. Dirty strips covered most of its body. Finally, its mouth was stuck wide open.

I stood there, motionless and completely terrified.

The thing turned its head left and right, then began to drag itself around in front of them.

I slowly started to move to the other side, taking the opportunity to look at the time I had left. 2 minutes.

I was never going to make it, 2 minutes to search the rest of the room with that thing lurking around was suicide.

Unable to control myself, a shudder ran through me and a sob escaped my mouth.

Immediately, the thing turned towards me, it was right in front of me, not even 10 feet away.

It dragged itself slowly toward me, as tears rolled down my cheeks and I bit my lips so nothing else would come out.

And then I saw it.

Inside that monster's mouth was a black key.

I lowered myself, my breathing slowed. I looked at the timer, there was only one minute left.

The key was standing vertically in the thing's mouth, which was precisely what was preventing it from swallowing. I was going to have to put my hand inside its mouth, and pull it out without losing any fingers.

I had no choice, I waited for it to approach again, and slowly, precisely, I put my right hand up to it’s mouth.

It was now or never, and in one swift movement I plunged 2 fingers inside its mouth, and the instant I pushed the key outwards, its mouth closed. I screamed, pulling my two fingers out of its mouth again and again. Fighting the unbearable pain, I gave a sharp tug and managed to pull them out, but not without losing the tip of my index finger in the process.

I ran to the black key that had bounced off the floor and lunged forward, blood running down my hand.

The thing screamed in rage behind me.

I had the key, but how could I use it? I didn't have time to think, I lunged for the front door in front of me, the door that was supposed to deliver me from this nightmare.

I tried to push it in the first time, but with my hand bleeding I could barely hold it without knocking it over.

The thing kept dragging its feet and knocking over all the furniture in its path.

I finally managed to insert the key while I could hear the thing taking the last few steps to reach me.

The moment I turned the key I could almost smell its breath on my neck.

I opened the door and jumped forward.

My head was buzzing, my sense of balance completely fried. I thought I'd jumped into the void and was now lost forever.

I opened my eyes, my head pointing downwards.

A gray, stained carpet lay beneath my fingers. I looked up to see that I was in the corridor of my apartment building. An old woman with her dog and groceries in her arms was eyeing me warily.

And in front of me, the door to my apartment had been left open, and fortunately, there was apparently no trace of the thing left.

It took me a while to get back into my apartment.

I lived with my ex-roommate for a few days, and eventually agreed to go back at least to collect my things before moving out, but only if they came with me, and the front door was left open all the time.

I moved to a smaller apartment on the other side of town and soon felt the pressure ease a bit.

A few days ago, I received an e-mail from an unknown recipient.

"*Dear participant,* 

*As agreed below you will find a code to redeem your $3000 in bitcoin as compensation for your participation.*

*We hope your experience was satisfactory, and that you will count yourself among our lucky customers when our game becomes available to all.*

*L.*"

I didn't respond, or even take the money.

To this day I'm terrified of locking a door, and every morning I open my front door with a knot in my stomach.

And sometimes, I can even feel a shivering cold wind when I open one.

I'm just afraid that the game isn't over, and that one day, I'll find another red key and the nightmare will start all over again.
