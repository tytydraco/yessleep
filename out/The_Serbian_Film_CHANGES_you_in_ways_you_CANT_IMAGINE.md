This might sound like I'm overdramatizing but Im 18 and this movie has disturbed me in ways nothing has, tbh its not the movie its what follows which truely fucks you up. 



The past few days have been too much for me, so I just wanted to vent, I stopped using my computer even tho I needed it to watch lectures. I only started my computer to prove to my parents that its still working and thought of venting here.



My past:

(you can ignore if you are only interested about the Serbian film)



I did not have the best childhood, my mother is a narcasist and emotionally abuses me any chance she gets, my father is barely present. I never had great friends who I could totally share everything with, all the memories of my childhood are just my mother pestering me for good grades, not letting me play with the neighbourhood kids for more than an hour, just stay home and study. My mental health started going down hill when my father was jobless for 2 years, and my mother kept abusing him every single day, she would cry and my father was visibly depressed(he finally got a job 1 year ago). I have a stutter, so you can imagine my social life. At that time I resorted to gaming and using reddit. I got more and more into the disturbing side of the internet. Yk darkweb and internet mysteries related videos etc. I lurked on subreddits such as crime scenes, darwin awards and even checked out the weirdest fetishes on doujin websites. This slowly but surely killed my sensitivity towards gore and disgusting content.





The Serbian Film:



In the title, I used the Serbian film as a metaphor for all 'dark' content on the internet, be it movies, videos etc. Just a week ago I was bored and again I went to reddit and found out abt movies like megan is missing, human centipede, the girl next door, 'THE SERBIAN FILM' etc. I watched quite a few of these feeling nothing much maybe just a little disgust. Things escalated once I found the uncut version of the serbian film on a website with borderline illegal content. Some of the scenes from the serbian film intrigued me, some of those were things which I had never seen before.. It still did not fuck me enough, only fueled my morbid curiosity even more especially because the site was full of insanity, it had tags which I had only seen in doujin websites. I dug deeper, my hands were shaking but I kept going I wanted to see what the fus is about until I stumbled upon a compilation which I would not name, maybe most of you already know. I skipped and played some scenes and holy shit, I was fucking done. I hadnt felt this fear is so long I thought I was insensitive to this stuff. I was scared to play the videos, I surfed on reddit on what they were about and realised what I was getting myself into, I was this close to watching the most infamous CSAM on the internet. I pulled out the HDMI cabel of my pc and threw it behind my big cupboard(basically very difficult access). 



Aftermath:



Im not gonna be using this pc anytime soon, I need a detox. I reconciled where my life was heading towards, I was watching this stuff as insesitively like disgusting perverts. All because of this pc, I thought I was safe behind my strong antivirus and I could just carefreely open any website which popped up. The things I have seen I will prolly remember for the rest of my life. I don't want my life to be like this, I dont even feel like sitting on my computer chair. Why did I do all this. Curiosity killed the cat. This is my message for the younger ppl of this sub, please think about your mental health, if you feel too attached to all this, this might just not be a hobby, its consuming you, leave your computer, talk to ppl make friends, I am going to soon too. Things keeps flashing infront of my eyes. you dont need to know the most vile things known to humanity to be the toughest guy possible, if you feel that you don't really get affected by such stuff, my friend you will one day come across something which will break you and it'll make you rethink all the decisions that led you there. Stay safe.
