Hello, my name is Josh, I don't want to give many details, I just want to tell this story.

When I was 10, me and my brother Alex were playing outside on our swing set, while our mother cooked inside, and our dad was just getting home from work.

My brother decided to go inside and get a drink of water, I stayed out and kept playing, waiting for him.

While I waited I looked out to the woods that surrounded our neighborhood, I saw something stareing back at me, but I couldn't seen any details.

I ran inside and told my parents, but they didnt do anything, just said it was my imagination.

Since it was late and my brother and I are already inside, my parents told us to stay inside and eat dinner, when we were done my brother and I went to bed.

All I could think about was the man I saw, but if my mom thought it was nothing, then it probably was nothing, just my imagination.

I woke up sometime late into the night by a loud bang, I laid there and listened, I heard nothing else and was about to go to sleep before I heard foot steps in the hall.

I thought it was my brother going to lay with our parents, maybe he was scared by the noises and didnt want to be alone.

I heard my doorknob start moving, not opening, but like being shaken.

I got annoyed, still thinking it was my brother, I got up and open the door, nothing was there, I looked around and my brothers door was wide open.

I went to go shut it, but when I got to the door, I saw the man standing over my brother, it turned to look at me, his pure black eyes stared at me, and his mouth shaped into a smile, showing his sharp teeth, he was hunched over holding my brother.

I ran to my parents room and woke them up, my dad, thinking it was nothing, got up and went into my brothers room. 

all I heard was a scream and my mother ran to see what happend, she ended up screaming too and ran back to me to make sure I didnt see it.

My dad called the cops and they came, I was taken outside of the house, I kept asking what happend, and where my brother was, no one told me anything.

I was questioned by police, and told then everything.

Afterwards my parents took me to a motel outside of the town we lived in.

When we got up to our room, my parents and I couldn't sleep, I stared out the window, looking around I saw the figure again, stareing at me.

I told my parents, and when they came over they didnt see anything, I kept telling them and pointing to him, but they never saw him and put me to bed.

I still don't know how to deal with that night, its been almost 20 years since this, my parents to this day never told me what they saw, with both of them dead now I won't ever know.

My little girl said she saw someone outside while she was playing, I think its just her imagination.
