People had always told me I was pretty enough to be a model. But I knew modelling was the farthest thing from what I wanted to do.

I loved to keep active and engaged, which was why I was studying environmental surveying at university. The last thing I wanted to do for a career was stand around all day, striking empty poses while photographers snapped pictures of clothes I was wearing—that I didn’t even like. I was the kind of girl who was always bouncing off the walls to go outside and do challenging, honest work. Modelling would not be that.

But I recognised that it was a relatively easy way to earn money. And I definitely could use a little extra cash while I completed my degree.

So, on that day when that businessman stopped me in the mall and asked me if I would be interested in modelling, I considered it. Unlike any of the times modelling had been mentioned to me before, I listened intently and took the man’s card. He explained that his department store in the mall was looking for live mannequins to model clothes in his storefront window. 

Come to think of it, I could remember seeing that display before when I’d visited the mall. The models had always looked so professional and composed, rarely moving or reacting to the mallgoers. I also recalled that they were beautiful, and felt flattered to be considered “on their level”.

“You have just the *right* look to be one of our live mannequins” the clean cut man exclaimed to me matter-of-factly. “Our clothes will look *perfect* on you—you’ll for sure get customers’ attention.”

“Thank you” I smiled back, flipping over the sleek business card for Forever Stunning.

It did seem like the store was in need of new live models though, as occasionally they would just use a real mannequin in place of a live mannequin. Who knew such a boring job would have trouble attracting models?

On the morning of my first shift, I did my hair and makeup as I’d been instructed to: nude makeup with my blonde hair worn down in loose waves. I threw on some jeans and a tank top and made my way to the mall.

The storefront of Forever Stunning was as immaculate today as it usually was, with various handbags and platform shoes neatly arranged around the white display. It looked out over the rest of the mall, in full view of the main atrium. There was already one live mannequin inside, a brunette woman with straight hair wearing a colourful wrap dress and wedge heels. Her eyes barely flitted at me as I passed, the rest of her not moving a muscle. 

She was a pro, I could tell.

Entering the sophisticated and bright clothing store, I immediately made my way to the front counter and met the manager—the man I’d spoken to earlier. Mr Roldan handed me hangers with the clothes I would be wearing today and pointed me in the direction of the changing rooms. Once I was dressed—in a demure yet stylish ruffle blouse, pencil skirt and strappy heels—I was finally led to the display.

After making sure my phone and bag had been put away, Mr Roldan’s welcoming tone suddenly evaporated as he gave me an unexpectedly severe warning.

“Under *no* circumstances are you to make any major movements while you are modelling at the display” he told me with an unflinching coldness. “Nor are you to leave your post for any reason before finishing your shift. There are severe consequences for models who do.”

I just nodded, taken aback by the absurd rules I’d just been given. What did he mean by consequences? This was just a crappy mall modelling gig. How would he even know if I moved? And what was he gonna do: fire me twice?

At his instruction, I stepped into position on the display and posed the way he wanted to, with both hands on my hips, my legs tilted to one side and my head facing straight forward. And then he turned and left, leaving me to my 4 hour shift.

It wasn’t as easy as I had thought it would be, and it didn’t take long for the discomfort to set in. My neck began to ache from staring straight, my hands began to feel hot from the blouse fabric, my ankles began to wobble in the tall heels.

Almost as annoying were the endless people walking by in front of the display. About a third ignored the display, but a good deal looked at me. Half would just observe me but keep walking, but the rest would react to me in some obnoxious way. Pointing at me, chuckling to their friends, shaking their heads in disapproval, mimicking my poses or even catcalling at me. Worst yet were the ones, usually kids, who would tap the glass or try distracting me, like I was some kind of zoo exhibit.  

I was sure at least an hour or two had passed, but I couldn’t even check my watch to be sure. All the while, the uncomfortable fabric was starting to irritate and cut into my skin. It seemed ridiculous that I would be expected to endure hours more of this without even a break to readjust myself.

“Hey, I’m just gonna take a quick break” I called out to the other model, still in pose. Before the words were fully out of my mouth, an urgent reply shot back from her.

“Do. Not. Move” she implored, her mouth barely moving from what I could see of her reflection in the window. Her pose—of having one hand on her chest, one hand held out at her side, and her head tilted slightly back—was considerably more uncomfortable than mine. And yet she was refusing to budge even a little.

“Just stick it out until the end of your shift. If you move you will seriously regret it” she hissed again. And she was completely right—though I had no idea at the time.

Some people take modelling jobs way too seriously, I thought to myself instead.

“Yeah, sorry but fuck that” I replied. Imperiously, I finally broke my pose and stretched my limbs, readjusted my garments and scratched any itches. It felt so good and I couldn’t believe I’d deprived myself of it for an hour over some silly rules.

Retaking my position, I noted that several passersby had witnessed my little character break from being a live mannequin. Hope that didn’t ruin the magic for them too much, I thought sarcastically. I could sense the disapproval coming from my fellow model but I didn’t care.

My discomfort fixed, I vowed to remain still for the rest of my shift.

My shift continued on and more people in the mall continued walking past the display. I noted with relief that dealing with their reactions had become easier. In fact, it felt like they were hardly reacting to me at all anymore. While shoppers were still pointing out and ogling my fellow live mannequin, with me they would look at my clothes or not look at me at all. 

It was an odd change but, I guessed, a welcome one too. 

Another hour had rolled by when there was a break in the monotony. My best friends from school were walking past the window and my excitement swelled to see familiar faces. I was sure they’d find it a right gag that I was working here and provide some amused reactions.

But as they approached the window, they looked right through me. They pointed at and reacted to the brunette model, but when their eyes landed on me, it was like they didn’t even register me as a friend…or a human.

As they passed the display, I leapt off it, running back into the store in panic.

“Whatever you do, don’t go into the mall! Finish your shift!” echoed the other model’s voice as I changed back into my own clothes and ran through the store. But I wasn’t going to listen to her. All those empty looks from people were weighing on me. I needed someone to see me as a person, to register my humanity. 

Exiting the store into the mall, at long last I noticed people looking at me, paying me attention. But that attention was the worst possible thing I could have received.

“What the *fuck* is that?!” a woman screamed, dropping her shopping bags in fright

“It’s a…*walking* mannequin!” screamed another, shielding her children from seeing me.

Looking at my hands in confusion, I at last saw what they saw. Shiny white plastic, like those of a mannequin, where skin should have been. My reflection in the mall fountain yielded the same: a featureless mannequin face in place of my attractive features. Posing stationary for the last hour, I had looked like a mannequin. And while running around the mall in confusion? I looked like an uncanny mannequin monster.

“Call security, a mannequin has come *alive*!”

At once, people began to circle around me from a distance, some pulling out phones to snap pictures and others blinking as if they couldn’t believe their eyes. By now, I’d wandered far from the storefront. In the background, the sound of a mall security cart rang out. I knew I had only seconds to get away.

I raced past the crowd, them leaping back in horror as if I was lunging at them. This bought me enough time to make it to the door of the mall maintenance corridor. Pulling out my employee pass, I quickly unlocked the door, threw myself behind and shut it.

Not waiting to see if anyone was following me inside, I took off running down the corridor. I caught glimpses of my stiff looking mannequin limbs and digits flapping around me, and hastened my desperation. I already knew what my only hope was. 

The brunette model had been right. I needed to finish my shift. This horrific mannequin curse had descended on me because I had broken the rules, and I needed to follow them to have any chance of lifting it.

Bracing myself, I stepped from the safety of the tunnel through the back entrance to Forever Stunning. I found myself standing behind a shelf on the other side of the store from the display window. I had to get back there. 

Careful not to run into any patrons of the store, I began creeping in my mannequin form through the aisles of the clothing store. If even one saw me, the alarm would be raised all over again and I would be done for. Passing the changing room, I waited patiently for an empty stall before darting in and changing back into my display outfit.

Finally, it was time for the home stretch. Throwing caution to the wind, I threw a large shawl over myself to conceal any sights of hardened plastic flesh and strode past the counter, in full view of shoppers. I’d just have to pray that no one saw me, or made a fuss if they did.

Back at my post, I tossed the shawl in a clothing bin and jumped back into position, hands on hips, legs tilted and head forward. And this time, I held my position like my life depended on it. Much like an actual mannequin, I didn’t move a muscle. I was on pins and needles waiting for that moment when someone in the mall would recognise me as the walking mannequin monstrosity from before.

Indeed, some people did look like they recognised me. But they walked on by, probably dismissing what they saw before as a mistake, hallucination or prank.

“Your shift is up” came the words I’d never thought I’d hear. Mr Roldan was back to tap me on the shoulder and hand me my clothes. I still couldn’t bring myself to believe that my nightmare was over, until a shopper came up to me.

“Excuse me, miss, do you know what aisle sweaters are?” she asked, staring me in the eye.

And that’s how I knew the curse was broken, and I was back to looking like a human being again and not a mannequin.

Of course, the curse wasn’t *fully* broken. On some level I think I knew that.

I had broken the job rules, moved when I wasn’t supposed to, and missed a portion of my shift.

To this day, whenever I move too fast, or too animatedly for too long, I’ll get glimpses of that plastic skin on myself. So will others around me, and they’ll utter those familiar shrieks of fear of a walking mannequin. It only lasts a second or so, and then they see me as my human self again.

Regardless, as a result, I’m not as energetic and active as I used to be. I try to be still whenever I can, when I’m out in the field working or socialising with others, so the curse doesn’t kick in.

I quit live modelling the day after my first shift. But I still find myself following that golden rule:

Do not move.
