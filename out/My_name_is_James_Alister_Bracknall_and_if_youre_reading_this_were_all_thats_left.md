The blight didn’t spread fast at first. It could have been two to three weeks before the first mutation caught some attention. Back when news came and went like internet trends, nobody really gave a small crop of dark stems another look.



I was nineteen, searching for a paper on cell membrane mutations when I first caught wind of its spread.



Somewhere in south America, a growth overtook a couple of acres of maize on a remote plantation. Its dark dry blotches dotted each leaf, before all nutrients were syphoned as it hopped to the adjacent plant.



A rapid spread followed, overtaking a large portion of its host countries maize reserves as it threatened to cripple their agricultural industry.



Two or three news stories shed some light on the process, but as it does, our focus was drawn to another conflict in the east, burying slight concerns with the mindless churn of our day to day.



With pitiful resistance from both our and their government its constant onrush resulted in a mutation, destroying all edible grain reserves in two neighbouring countries. Before anyone really knew, it had entered our continent.



In our neglect a sprout rose up as the blight took root in another family. Within a week of its migration out of the Americas, it had altered again, now contaminating all geophytes, including ground vegetables.



Governmental bodies scrambled as we were on the edge of a global food shortage. Some opted for quarantines and research, whilst others deemed the threat too dire and conversely chose the scorched earth method.



Sadly, we were too late. Nothing was going to slow the global blanket of rotten foliage left in its wake. Before the years end all photosynthesising plants were susceptible.



Martial law went into effect as a subsection of the most ‘privileged’ people were shuffled off into one of the twelve underground stations.



Built in the event of another world war, they were bomb proof, but that wasn’t the factor we depended on.



Fortunately for myself, our family owned the largest meat production line in our country, so I had to kiss my cosy life goodbye for the safety of station seven.



From our secured bunker we watched the outside world crumble. As quickly as our government had issued its control order, like many others we became a lawless vestige of our former glory.



Some of us watched the disarray unfold from whatever sites still operated in the final months. Our world, once a lush and vibrant natural wonder, now a scorched stain, resembling a dystopian apocalypse.



Estimates say our population halved, but its decline must have been more rapid once we locked our doors and left those on the surface to fend for themselves.



People eat what they could and with the blight quickly ravaging almost all plant life, there really wasn’t enough to go around.



Cults arose mindlessly chanting about their prophesised judgment day, with this event heralding a second coming. Other pledge their allegiance to whatever devil or demon would bring them salvation. Though none came.



With the world on the brink, we were given a lifeline.



A researcher from overseas, living in our country at the time, had been working on a model. Using the latest AI software, a none-hazardous solution could be attainable, though they’d need to allow his systems to run a wide array of simulation over the next two years.



With all twelve stations diverting thirty percent of their power to station two, the solution would be gifted to us, if we could only wait out the storm.

  
In the beginning we had contact with other nations, but as quickly as we retreated, they too buried their heads in the sand. 



With the only other suggestion being to nuke the blight with a toxic cloud of chemicals designed to eradicate all plant life, we didn’t have much of a choice.



Those first weeks, people still wanted to live their frivolous lives, viewing the chaos outside as if it were occurring on a distant planet. However, our elected station operative quickly had them in line.



I was pretty sure I’d heard of him before, but he was your quintessential no-nonsense military supervisor. Food, power and water were scrupulously rationed, with our hundred odd cast living a quiet communistic life.



My job was fairly mundane, but I wasn’t one to kick up a fuss. Logging the supplies was a quiet, relaxing task that allowed me to write in my journal. From the moment we were forced to evacuate, I wanted something that could at least take up some of the long years I’d be stuck in this bunker.



As good as we had it comparatively, some didn’t view it that way, only fuelling their dispassion for our command structure. Those who had power, before the blight, wanted it again, though that would only cause a rift large enough to collapse the tenuous structure we had.



Infighting ramped up as there were routine disagreements, leading up to the inevitable. A mutiny.



Though the twenty or so authority figures were armed, they just didn’t have the ammunition for what came.



For the first time, billionaires, celebrities and entrepreneurs formed a rough coalition with their goal to take control of our station, no matter the cost. Rounding up any blunt instrument, from bed posts to mops, they stormed the small office and within the hour had removed our stations leaders.



In their place a crudely fashioned electoral took charge as all assets and supplies were regulated by them. As expected, those who sided with the new status quo would be permitted free, unrestricted usage, whereas those who sided with the old guard or simply abstained, got nothing.



Within five months our station was as lawless as the outside world and mirrored its depravity. Supplies flatlined as our once high and mighty one percent lowered themselves to the levels seen outside. Groups routinely cannibalised once compatriots, now only deemed as consumable commodities.



Power was cut pretty quickly after the other stations realised what they’d done, but nothing changed. With our sanctuary now as dangerous as the outside worlds, we had to leave.  



Getting to the emergency release was a bloodbath. As it seemed, the new order inside was content to rule their isolated sects, with no interference. Sadly, with the sacrifice of a few, a small band of us made it to the external door.



What awaits us out there will undoubtably be a barren hell, but any place to escape the ritualistic lottery in here is worth it. Hopefully there are other countries working on a solution too, but that only seems like wishful thinking.



I pray if you’re reading this from any of the still functional stations, hang on until the tests have been run. If not, there’s no hope for us on the surface.
