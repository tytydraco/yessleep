Hi my name is Jimmy, and

This all started two days ago when I was on my way home. I was on a important business trip and I decided I should take a train home instead of a cab. so I got a ticket for 9:00 A.M tomorrow. This place had a place for people to sleep in case they needed to catch an early train. So I set my stuff down in a locker and went to bed and I woke up at around 4:00 A.M of and I felt well rested so I decided to go out and grab breakfast from the snack counter but no one was there guess they close the Stands after dark so I was about to just go outside for a smoke but then I noticed something.

It was snowing quite heavily at that I saw this out a window I was going to smoke out there but it was way to cold to so I just decided to sit back down in the lounge. The tv was still on and tuned into the news as the news anchor began to speak. "Gentlemen who might be in the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* area can expect a heavy blizzard looks like all trains are being delayed due to this." 

My reaction to this information wasn't about how I was gonna be stuck in here a while it was god damnit I'm not gonna be home for a while. I noticed something weirder I was alone guess the guy was going home for the blizzard asshole couldn't have woken me so I could get to shelter now I'm stuck here. it's not all bad I have food I have water and electricity. Even though the lights outside were out maybe there was a generator powering the place. 

Not gonna complain obviously I decided to grab my blanket and bundle up in the lounge area watching the tv. It was mainly just news but they did have some other channels I could watch if I got bored. I stayed in that lobby all day only going to bed when I couldn't keep my eyes open anymore. That was yesterday I expected this thing to blow over by now but it's still raging on. 

Only now have I realized that I haven't eaten yet so I decided to go behind the snack stand and get myself something. Of course it wasn't much there but I did find a pizza slice I heated up it was alright but it satisfied my needs so I grabbed a water from the cooler and then pressed on with my day. nothing much to report I guess I will write when I think of something interesting.

DAY 7

I have been recording the days since I have been here and damn a full week. it's been a while now I thought that this thing would blow over by now but guess not. watching the tv they stopped covering the blizzard in favor of some celebrity drama bullshit. It's been getting colder and colder by that day so much so that I have to use two blankets just to feel warm. speaking of which I ate all the perishable food already it would have expired by now so I don't regret it but I will miss them but I'm sure I will get out of here soon. as far as drinks go though I should be fine for at least two more weeks. Of course a damn blizzard hits when there's a shortage of supplies in the area.

 The snow has been hellish now I am trying not to sound like a whiny bitch but  it's been getting worse every day I have been wearing two layers of clothes now just to stay warm. well I guess I will write soon enough. 

Day 10

Is anyone coming to help me? I am still here and the news still isn't covering us still on some drama. I swear man it's like nobody even knows this is happening. well no point in complaining not like it will change things. I am starting to run out of supplies I am starting to ration my supplies two bags of chips a day and a small candy bar for energy and one drink. this should last me maybe 20 more days if I ration it correctly. 

And now I swear there's something in the snow I was asleep last night and woke up late I tried to go back to sleep but I heard a scratching noise from the window I was scared shitless so I didn't move or say anything. eventually the scratching stopped and I fell back asleep. The cold is becoming unbearable I am using everything I can to stay warm.

 I found a way to get into the ticket masters booth so I decided to snoop around and I found a gun nothing special just a Glock 17 with a few magazines just 3. so I took it just incase don't know what's out there after all and it never hurts to be ready to defend yourself. other than that was a hatch leading into the basement/maintenance room. Probably where they keep the generator I was tired so I went to sleep I will write again soon.

Day 15 

Fuck Fuck Fuck this is just Fucking great the power went out today and I had to go down to repair it so with nothing but the Glock I grabbed and a flashlight I went down there and god damn if it was cold up there it might as well have been a god damn freezer down here. nevertheless I continued down as I approached a old dusty generator I guess it ran out of gas so I grabbed a nearby jerry can still half full so I poured it all into the generator and gave it a crank.

 after some fiddling the thing finally started and the lights down there turned on and I saw the old ticket master he was on the ground dead. I stepped back in horror wondering what happened. as I almost threw up I managed to swallow it back down and decided to examine what happened I flipped him over and saw a huge slash across his chest he was cold practically frozen.

 I examined the wound a deep slash across his chest his guts were spilled out also frozen this place was hellishly cold but then I thought a little. What the hell did this to him I didn't plan on staying to find out I left the place going back upstairs. as far as my food situation still bad I am losing food quicker and quicker by the day I need energy to stay warm so I couldn't really stick to my plan of rationing. This cold has been messing with my head I keep imagining things like dark figures in the corner of my vision.

 The news were still not talking about us I was worried did they actually forget about us. until I saw something the news was doing a story about the blizzard recovery maybe they were finally going to help me maybe this was finally over. but the next thing I saw flushed all hope from my body it was sunny and they were filming in front of the station I was stuck in.

 what the fuck was going on I looked outside to see if it was true but no still snowing like all hell. I turned the tv off and thought of what was happening was I trapped in a different reality no no way right? well with what I just saw this was a real possibility. I couldn't handle it so I went to bed to calm down I will write soon I swear. 

Day 20 

I am now out of food and still no help in sight I didn't take this information well to myself I thought was I going to die here? I was thinking until my thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a growl from down below was it that thing that killed the Ticket master I knew that if I didn't kill it now it would just want to kill me more so I gathered my courage grabbed the gun and went down below the lights were mostly smashed except one bellow the light 

illuminated in it's glow is what I assumed was the ticket master he was torn apart clearly this thing has been eating good but I refused to be on the main course.  so I waited there and listened and prepared for the worst I heard a roar as the thing leaped for me I ducked and began to unload into it as it began to whimper in pain. When I ran out of bullets in a mag I would just put another in and by the time I ran out of bullets the thing was dead I decided to leave it and the gun there no bullets left anyway so no point I was horrified by what just happened. So now I am going to sleep I am worried of the future to come if you see this please send help. 

Day 25 

The hunger proved to become a huge problem if I wanted to survive this I needed to eat but that was a problem because I had nothing to eat until I remembered the creature downstairs it was probably made of meat right? against my better judgment I went downstairs to retrieve the corpse and luckily the cold down there perfectly preserved the corpse so I thawed it out upstairs. 

but I needed to cook it so I made a fire pit out of some stones and junk I then lit a match and lighted the fire. the warmth gave me a pleasure I haven't felt in years and now here I am as I am putting this corpse close to the edge of the fire.  An hour passed and finally I deemed the meat to be done I hacked off a piece with a makeshift blade I made out of Broken steel and wood fragments. the meat tasted awful but I didn't care I ate it all the organs the skin all of it it was practically a skeleton when I was finished. Hopefully this would last me a while I will write soon I hope. 

Day 32 

I am out of drinks I am already feeling the effects of dehydration kicking in. I won't last long now my only chance to make it is to go out scavenging but I had barely any strength and practically nothing to defend myself. if another one of those things attacked me. but even then I have it decided tomorrow I will scavenge out there I will write how it went when I return.

Day 34 

It went terribly I was followed by them and now they are scratching the doors windows everything I found a gun out there but with not nearly enough to kill them all I am uploading this to ask you please respond before I am forced to do it Please.
