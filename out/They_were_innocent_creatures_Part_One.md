William Harlowe, a former nurse at Good Samaritan Hospital, was 61-years-old when the police charged him with four counts of murder. The surveillance footage showed him entering the nursery at 2:47 AM, where he lifted a three-day-old Estrella Rodriguez out of her bassinet. He turned away from the camera and held her for one minute and forty seconds, during which time he removed a syringe from his sleeve and stuck the needle into the baby’s tiny jugular vein. When he placed Estrella back in her bassinet, she was already dead.

This was the fourth and final murder he committed. The first two went undetected, explained away as unfortunate cases of SIDS. But when the third newborn died without explanation, a detective with the San Jose Police Department finally put the pieces together. William Harlowe was the main suspect, along with an unknown accomplice who appeared to be part of the nursing staff. The second man stood in the background of each murder, keeping watch for bypassers and potential witnesses. But nobody recognized the individual. He wore sunglasses over his medical mask to conceal his identity. 

Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the after fourth murder when the cops finally put Harlowe down. He’d made a mistake: You could clearly see the syringe in his hand just before he plunged the needle into Estrella’s delicate neck. The surveillance footage burned him.

But Harlowe’s accomplice was never identified.

...

Last May, I drove out to the east side of San Jose and interviewed Daniel DiMarco, the homicide detective who resolved the case and arrested Harlowe. He was semi-retired by then, working night shifts for half the week and spending the other half shoulder-deep in booze. I knocked on the door, and the detective answered. He looked haggard and exhausted with that raggedy beard and those baggy eyes. The man reached out for a handshake, and I could smell the sweat emanating from the pit stains of his gray sweater. He spoke with the gravelly tone of a lifelong smoker.

“Rowan Thompson?” he said. “It’s good to meet you in person.”

Jesus, I thought. Sure, a murder detective might have some sleepless nights, but he looked like a homeless junkie. I stowed my hangups and wore my best PR grin.

“Likewise, Detective.”

“Call me Daniel,” he said. “Come on in. I just made some coffee.”

The house had been built decades ago for a large family. Photographs lined the wall showing a pair of kids and a round-faced Latina along with a man who vaguely resembled the detective. The carpet hadn’t been vacuumed in ages, matted up with old grime and dog hair like something dragged out of a condemned building. I didn’t see a dog around, nor a wife or kids for that matter. I figured it best not to bring it up. Not that I’m one to judge a solitary person. I never had a family of my own: Single, childless, and laser-focused on my work like the protagonist in the first act of a romcom. But Daniel’s situation didn’t seem quite so voluntary.

We entered the kitchen and sat across from each other at a dirty, chest-high island. A thin manila folder waited on the tiled counter between us.

“I’d like to record this interview,” I said. “Is that all right?”

“Sure. Go ahead.”

I set the recorder on the table and pressed the red button. “It’s 9:39 AM at the residence of Daniel DiMarco,” I said into the microphone, “a detective with the San Jose Police Department. Daniel, would you mind introducing yourself?”

He grunted something incomprehensible, then he stood up and lurched over to his coffee maker. The detective grabbed a dirty mug from the sink and rinsed it out, then he filled it with some joe and at least three fingers of Jameson. 

“Want some?” 

I shook my head, patiently waiting for him to sit back down so the recorder could pick up his answers clearly.

“I know it’s early,” he said, “but ten AM is bedtime for me.” He dropped himself into his chair with a heavy sigh. I could smell something rancid on his breath. “So did you have questions for me, or what?”

“Well, I wanna know everything there is to know about the case.”

He laughed humorlessly. “You sure you don’t want that drink?”

“Very.”

“Your call.” He pushed the manila folder towards me. “Go ahead and take a look.”

The folder contained a stack of printed stills taken from surveillance footage in the nursery at Good Samaritan. Black and white, fuzzy resolution. Two men stood near the bassinet — William Harlowe faced the camera, cradling a sleeping infant in his arms. The second man was visible only in profile. He was dressed in scrubs and had short, combed hair with a thin moustache poking out the sides of his medical mask.

Daniel reached across the island and tapped the image of Harlowe’s wrist. He wore a long-sleeve shirt under his scrubs, and there was a bulge visible under his sleeve.

“Do you know what that is?” said the detective.

“Yes. An empty syringe.”

“That’s right. He taped it to his wrist with a cover over the needle so he wouldn’t poke himself by mistake. Then when nobody was around, he’d pretend to go check on them. And, well—he pulled this off four fucking times before I got him.”

“Is this the image that made the case?”

“No,” he said. “The next one.”

I flipped to the next page. Harlowe’s back faced the camera now, but he stood at an angle where you could still see his hand and the baby’s neck. The needle protruded from his sleeve. There were only a dozen pixels to make the thing out.

“Good God,” I said. “How could something like this happen?”

The detective let out a heavy sigh and slurped down the rest of his coffee. Then he lumbered over to the coffee maker and refreshed his glass. I flushed up a bit when it occurred to me what a nonsense-burger of a question I’d just asked him. I moved on to something specific and concrete.

“Do you have any theories about the accomplice?” I said. “Who he is? How he gained access to the nursery?”

“Sure,” he said. “I’ve got theories. Everybody’s got a theory. You got a theory?”

“Well, as the lead detective who broke the case, your opinion carries quite a bit more weight than mine.”

“You know what they say about opinions, lady.” He burped and dropped himself back into his chair. Then he swayed for a moment, his eyes closed while he bobbed on an ocean of thought. I was just about to move on before he continued. “As far as I’m concerned, the man’s a ghost.” He opened his eyes and gave me a hard glare. “Either Harlowe buried him in a shallow grave somewhere, or he wised up and got the hell outta Dodge. Flip a coin. Either way, he’s in the wind—as they say.”

The mug trembled in his hand. I took a small photo clipping out of my pocket and set it down on top of the stack of papers. It was another photograph—this one cut out of a newspaper, the corner of a larger front-page snapshot. The picture showed a man sitting in the back of the courtroom. He wore the same mask with a thin moustache poking out the sides, but no sunglasses. His eyes were dark and vacant.

“This photo was taken the day they sentenced William Harlowe,” I said. “Doesn’t he look awfully familiar?”

The detective brushed the photo aside and said, “I’ve seen that. It’s a bunch of horseshit.”

“What makes you say that?”

“It’s a man with a goddamn moustache,” he shouted. “What, you wanna go and put out an APB on every fuckin’ guy in Silicon Valley with outdated facial hair?”

I chose my tone carefully before I continued. “I see your point. Sorry, you’re right. It was a stupid thing to bring up.”

He waved me off with a smile, and his volume returned to normal. “It’s all right. You’re just doing your job. Hell, I pissed off a lotta people trying to find that asshole. I hauled in half the fuckin’ hospital, brought the hammer down on them. Said I had this evidence and that witness statement. Almost got my ass sued.” He gulped down another mouthful of Irish coffee and shook his head. “No. It had to be a disguised intruder.”

The gears were running in his head again, like something wretched had been dredged from the pit of his being. He was solving the case all over again. I felt bad for putting him into this headspace right before his bedtime.

“There’s just one thing I couldn’t get past,” the detective continued. “When I interviewed Harlowe, he kept talking about some guy named Benjamin Morse. Apparently this character runs some kind of fucked-up self-help group. They lure in young men and say the key to happiness is to be alone. No girlfriends, no marriage, no children.” He paused, then he emphasized: “No children.”

“You think this Morse guy might’ve been the accomplice?”

“No. He didn’t fit the profile. Short, round guy with a big, white beard. There was something off about him, but we couldn’t pin him for conspiracy or anything like that.”

The detective slurped down the rest of the coffee in his mug, and he went back to the coffee maker for thirds. He returned to the island, yawning like a lion, and said, “I’m afraid I won’t be much use after I finish this last round.”

“That’s fine,” I said. “I just have one more question. Does Benjamin Morse accept women into this little group?”

He cocked an eye at me, and for a long moment he said nothing. Then he leaned closer and lowered his voice. “Would you mind shutting this off?”

That was never a good sign, but I had no choice but to comply. California law said so. I clicked off the red button sand said, “Is something wrong?”

“I wanna make one thing clear,” said the detective. “I know who you are, and I know why you’re doing this.”

I said nothing.

“I saw your work in Ukraine,” he growled. “You interviewed a young couple five minutes after their daughter died in a rocket attack. It was some real despicable stuff.”

“If you’re tired, I can get out of your hair.”

“I tried to help those kids,” he told me. “If you aim to get rich off them, that’s your soul on the line. Not mine. Don’t expect me to come looking for you if they disappear your ass.”

He showed me out of the house without another word.
