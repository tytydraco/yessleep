I (32 M) was driving home with my wife (34 F) last Sunday night after spending the week visiting family.   
  
I think a lot of people, like me and my wife, have an unspoken agreement/acknowledgement to not pick up hitchhikers. We were taught growing up that anyone on the side of the road was probably some sort of serial killer or kidnapper wanting to catch anyone kind enough to pull over for them, so we just drive on by pretending we don’t see them.  
  
When I was driving that night, I saw an elderly woman standing beside the road with her thumb out. I almost didn’t see her since she was hunched over in a black coat that blended into the dark, but the wrinkled skin of her hand was so white and pale that it was practically blinding.  
  
Like I said before, I don’t pick up hitchhikers. I never pick up hitchhikers. However, for some reason, I locked eyes with the poor woman and my body just worked on its own to pull over and let her in. I didn’t think about it, really, but I could tell from my wife’s side glance that I f-ed up.  
  
The car ride itself was fine, I think. At one point my wife accepted some homemade peanut brittle from the older woman, which was surprising to say the least. I took it as a sign that she was starting to see that the woman wasn’t going to hurt us and that I made the right decision, but as you’ll read soon, I was definitely wrong.  
  
When we finally dropped the woman off, me and my wife sat together in the car to talk for a bit. It started off with a light conversation about how she wished that I had asked her first before making that decision and whatnot, but in the middle of talking she just kinda… zoned out? I kept trying to explain to her that I wasn’t thinking about my actions and that I was sorry, but she just started telling me to drive. She was getting more and more urgent about it, which I didn’t understand until I looked out the rearview mirror. The elderly woman that we had just dropped off was sprinting, not running, sprinting towards our car at full speed, sobbing and screaming random nonsense like “she’s not me” and “I’m not her.” Needless to say, I put the pedal to the metal and drove the hell outta dodge.  
  
We haven’t talked since that night. If we dropped that woman off about 5 minutes too late, she probably would have acted crazy in the car and gotten at least one of us hurt. I feel horrible about my actions that night, and my wife’s silence is only making me feel worse. I understand that she is mad, but instead of trying to talk it out, she just stares at me. It always happens when my back is turned or when I think I’m alone, and I think she does it to freak me out to make me feel the same way she felt that night in the car, or something. There’s been nights where I accidentally wake up too early from a deep sleep, and I can just feel her eyes staring at me from behind my back.  
  
There was even a time recently when I was doing work on my computer and that feeling of being watched came back, but after turning around and seeing that no one was in the room, I just ignored it and went back to typing. After a little bit, I finished up what I was doing and got up from my chair to stretch when I saw her peering out of the closet. Her eyes were so wide that it almost looked like she didn’t even have eyelids, and her fingers that were holding the edge of the sliding door were long and spindly like spider legs. It scared the shit out of me, and when I confronted her about it she just slinked out of the room and into the kitchen.  
  
I wanted to post this here because I know I messed up, but also feel like I don’t think it was so bad that my wife’s actions are justified. AITA in this situation, and do I deserve this treatment?
