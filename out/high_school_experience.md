This is a high school based horror story that happened  to me when I was in my first semester of high school, so I was still new to my school in general. I wasn't the most social person which is an aspect about me that plays an important role in this story. Before high school, I didn't have so many friends that treated me very well, which did make me more antisocial. So i figured I'd make a bunch of new friends when high school started.

I became friends with this one kid who also went to my middle school who I'll just refer to as Joe. Joe was a guy that I seemed to have quite a bit in common with, I followed him on social medias and we primarily talked through DMs on Instagram, but eventually we started texting. I honestly didn't see much wrong with the dude at first, but I noticed he gradually became more of a bad and overall sketchy kid. Around 4 months into us knowing each other, he sent me a pretty bizarre text that read "yo meet up with me and my friend Daniel next week it's hella important". Confused as to what was so important about it, I asked "um ok? how is it important?". "it's a surprise" he replied back. At this point, I was getting a little weirded out, but I didn't think much of it. "I don't like surprises that much" I said. He then replied "I promise you'll like it, you can trust me right". I left it off with "yeah i guess so". I noticed that as we were texting and talking regularly, he started to act so fucking rude to me out of nowhere. When I would ask for advice he would say "just get better", Overall giving off bad vibes.

The day came that he asked if I could hang out (mind you I completely forgot all about the whole "having a surprise for me" thing). I replied "no I can't today I have somewhere to go for a while", he said "meet us tomorrow then". The next day came, I was eating lunch so this was around 12pm and I received a text from Joe asking if I was coming or not". I said "yea hold on I'm eating lunch" and he said "bro hurry the fuck up it's cold". He followed that up with a guilt trippy phone call saying "man I can't believe you'd leave us in the cold like that". I honestly thought it was pretty ridiculous how impatient they were being. I finally came out, I noticed they were right outside my house, downright creepy honestly. I didn't really know who this Daniel guy was, I had seen him around school sometimes. Upon getting a good look at him, I realized he looked very fucking sketchy, definitely someone you wouldn't want to say the wrong thing to. They asked me to follow them and so I did. Mid doing this I asked "where are we going" "it's something cool I promise" they said. That was weird, I honestly thought about making up some lie saying how I had to go but I didn't, I wanted to see this through.

After about 5 minutes they said "we're here". I was dumbfounded, it was an old decrepit house that had been foreclosed for years. I thought we were gonna explore it. I feel like a fool for not picking up on any red flags there. We went inside the house through a back entrance that was covered up by overgrown shrubs. They told me to peak in first because they have been there before and said "they" wouldn't recognize me. I don't know who "they" was but that's besides the point. I went in, peaked around and shouted out "uh I don't think anyone is in here". They were about 8 feet from me when they said "yo check out over there" I looked in and three things happened at once. I heard manic footsteps, felt my whole body being pushed down and against a wall, and had multiple punches being thrown at my face. I honestly thought all this was a prank to scare me. That was until I was pinned down and Daniel yelled in my ear "HEY, YOU DON'T TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS, OR ELSE IT WON'T BE GOOD FOR YOU BUD". In a shaky yet calm voice I said "okay okay, this is safe with me". "NOW GET OUT, SCRAM" he yelled back.

I ran away from there faster than I knew I could, while frantically dialing my dad's number to tell him all about it as I was running back. I turned around for a split second and they were following me for a little bit and then stopped. I noticed in that split second, Daniel pulling out something from his pocket as I was running away, I didn't see what it was though. Once my dad saw me, it was a screaming match of him yelling "WHAT'S GOING ON TELL ME" and me yelling back "THEY BEAT ME ASS MAN". he then yelled back "GET IN THE CAR WE'RE FINDING THEM" we looked all over town, but they weren't anywhere around. Another thing that sucks is that they stole my favorite beanie that i brought because it was cold. The next day I repeated the whole story back to my schools police officer and principal. Because of the track record of Daniel and Joe, and the with texts I received from Joe, I managed to get them both expelled. I found out that before Joe was expelled, he told one of his friends that he genuinely thought about killing me after I told the principal and police about the whole situation. I'm forever grateful they didn't do anything else since then. It's been about 4 months since this whole thing and looking back now I don't know how I was so oblivious to so many red flags. If anything else does happen, I'll update.

TL;DR

I made new friends and one of them faked being my friend to beat me up and threaten to kill me
