TW: animal abuse

[My brain hurt trying to process the things I’d learned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h9fqnj/the_previous_tenant_left_a_survival_guide_can_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Derek had never mentioned his family or that he, by blood, had a claim to the building. He was always so in tune with it, it made sense but it was never something I’d considered. 

I woke on the sofa that morning confused. I had no idea how to continue. The vine had grown almost the entire perimeter of the flat, carefully weaving between my furniture and appliances, it’s waxy exterior reflecting sunlight from the windows. It stopped at the bedroom door, not crossing the threshold to Jamie’s prison. 

I bit the bullet and decided to call Terri. I hadn’t spoken to her since her and the kid’s visit a few days prior and I wanted to see if she remembered Derek ever talking about his brother or if she knew of any basement. Terri had grown up in the building, she was bound to have explored more thoroughly than Mr Prentice. 

Before I could get on to any of that I owed her an apology. My interaction with her  had been rude and I had been too distracted to check on her the past few weeks. I had been a terrible friend. 

I hit dial on video chat and waited for a response. When she picked up the phone she looked even worse than she had the last time I saw her. The dark circles were beginning to look like deep, inky tattoos, permanently stained on her face. Still, she smiled, just like she always did. 

“Terri, are you ok? I’m so sorry about the other day I was just...” 

“It’s fine Kat. I understand, everything with Ms Beckman must have bought back some tough feelings for you. I should’ve waited a day or two... I’m sorry.” My heart melted as she spoke, I’d never had such a loyal and genuine friend. 

“Thank you. Don’t be sorry, it helped seeing you guys. How are you doing?” I asked.

“I’m ok. The kids aren’t behaving great at night, I’m not sure if lockdowns got to them or something else. I have to watch everything that they do. The other day I caught Eddie trying to take apart the washing machine with his claws. By the time I stopped him Ellie had ripped up the shower curtains trying to climb them.” She sounded defeated and, at best, definitely not ok. 

“I wish I were allowed to help. I miss you.” I sighed, longing for the day I could sit and drink tea with her. 

“Are you ok Kat? You haven’t been yourself.” She asked; we may not have known each other that long but she could sense when things weren’t right. Terri was the epitome of an empath. This, I’d come to realise over the months, had been the only reason she kept in touch with Prudence, she’s just so damn nice. 

“I’m not. I don’t know if you know about Essie’s predictions... but she made one for me and it’s sent me to some strange places. I’ll tell you more when I figure it out but for now I need your help.” 

I still chose to omit Jamie from my confessions, but I was ready to be a bit more open, I wasn’t to ashamed to admit I needed help. Terri clearly knew about Essie’s gift. She didn’t bat an eyelid. 

“Anything.”

“Do you remember Derek ever mentioning a brother, even when you were growing up?” I asked. 

“Not at all. Derek was always on his own, just appearing when we needed him. I was really young when he first disappeared though, so I don’t remember him well and might not be the one to ask.” Terri’s face scrunched up in thought as she racked her brain. 

“I’m going to send you something.” I minimised the video chat and copied the photo from the email onto my phone and sent it to her by text. Her video paused for a moment as she did the same to check the attachment. “He was the first to live here Terri. His dad built the place.” 

Terri’s video clicked back on. 

“Where did you find this?” She asked.

I explained the blog and why I had been looking. It wasn’t a short explanation so I’ll spare you that. We even broke from the seriousness briefly for the kids to come and fawn over the kittens. Eddie loved Mr Meow whilst Ellie wanted to kidnap Tetley. Wrinkles just curled up with me, he was my secret favourite anyway. 

Terri was fascinated by the vine. She wondered if it had a connection to Derek, especially given the photo I’d found on my search. I can’t say the thought hadn’t crossed my mind either. I learned more about him every day, but he would always first and foremost be the gardener. The vine made sense, but the basement didn’t. I was struggling to connect it to the brothers. 

“I don’t know about a basement Kat. But if this place is as old as you say then who knows. I know I may look haggard..” she pulled on her cheeks and giggled. “..but I’m really not that old.”

I laughed. I was sad that she didn’t have anymore information but it was nice to just talk to a friend. For five minutes life felt normal. 

I’d kept my secret, and talking to Terri I’d almost managed to forget about Jamie myself. If it hadn’t been for the deep bite wound on my finger from the feeding the day before and the open cuts on my chest from his attack I might have been successful. 

I still had no idea what the riddle Essie had given to me meant. I was looking as hard as I could and it had lead me down a rabbit hole that just kept spewing more questions. 

What I did know, was that with Jamie’s seemingly permanent change in demeanour I was running out of time. The growling hadn’t stopped, the look of pure hatred as I dropped in food didn’t end and I was getting frightened. 

Something had to give. Either Jamie was going to die, or I would. There wasn’t another option I could see and the former may have been entirely unachievable. 

Derek destroyed Lyla, but he never returned after. Prudence claimed she killed the original wave of creatures by setting light to them all on the already burnt out ninth floor, again something entirely unachievable without Derek’s presence. I had to find him.

I said my goodbyes to Terri, promised that I would update her when and if I could and left to do my daily errands for Mr Prentice and the couple next door. As I left for the exit I spotted a man going into Ms Beckman’s flat. I recognised him as the son that I’d always seen visiting, eyes glazed with tears. 

Terri had said that she would get Molly to inform Essie’s family, but I couldn’t imagine what Molly might have said happened. 

I should’ve gone to him, just as a human being tried to comfort him, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it without an explanation to offer. I promised myself that I would visit him when lockdown was over and I knew why his mother was gone. 

I rushed out and completed my errands as quickly as possible, eager to get home; even having the name Albert Miles might have been helpful if I just kept digging on the internet. 

After I dropped the bags off at Percy and Sylvia’s door I turned the key in my own, entered and shut it behind me like I always would. 

That was where the normality ended and my life was disrupted by an uninvited guest. 

When I turned to face the flat and caught a glimpse of my fold out table there was a tall figure stood right next to it. 

Albert, like Derek, was a little older than he had been in the photo. There was a family resemblance but the eyes weren’t the same, Albert’s weren’t warm and kind, they were cold and filled with malice. 

He wore a suit, similar to the one in the picture but it wasn’t as sharp, it was covered in a thick layer of dust and tattered, with loose threads hanging everywhere, like clothes that had been dug out of a box in the attic. 

He grinned at me. It was smug, like something you might expect from a slimy car salesman. 

“It’s been a long time since I had to visit any of the residents up here. I like what you’ve done with the place, much more modern than when that old bint before you lived here.” 

I was frozen to the spot. I hadn’t been alarmed when his brother had appeared inches from me on a bench but something about Albert was much more sinister. The thought of his son, dead on the balcony played on repeat in my mind. 

“Why are you here?” I asked.

He laughed. The smug grin extended across his cheeks.

“I like you. You didn’t even pretend not to know who I am. You know, Kat, I’ve always appreciated a person who cuts the small talk. It’s better in business and in life. That trait will hold you in good stead.” He was animated as he spoke, gesticulating wildly. 

“You didn’t answer my question. Don’t you find that ironic considering your sentiment?” I answered back, still terrified but figuring that keeping him talking might somehow help the situation. 

“I don’t need to answer your question. You know why I’m here.” He continued to grin, raising an eyebrow and adjusting the torn sleeves of his suit. “It’s not often that I’ve come across a tenant that causes as much chaos as you do. 

“It’s usually issues with the rent, and even something like that hasn’t happened for quite some time, but you are something special.” 

He stamped on part of the vine that was growing near his feet and I watched as the enormous structure withered and shrunk in size, as if it were in notable pain. 

The beginning of my entire ordeal flooded back to me. I was back in my kitchen, discovering Prudence’s note for the first time, reading the one rule that I’d never learned anything more about. 

*1. The landlord will never bother you, he doesn’t visit, call or communicate in any way. But make sure to pay your rent in a timely fashion always. I have only dealt with him once in 35 years and let’s just say I never missed another rent day. Any repairs required you speak to the agent you rented the place with.*

Rule number one. So much happened that I hadn’t thought much about that rule, but there must have been a reason she put it first, before even mentioning the creatures. Suddenly the literal monster in my closet seemed soft and fluffy in comparison to the ageless man stood in front of me.

“I’ve paid my rent. Why are you here?” I stood firmly, curling my shaking hands into fists. It was more for comfort than aggression. On the surface, I was hoping it would appear I was standing my ground. 

The rent part was true. It was hard, but I always found a way. I was still training to teach and pulled in extra cash running after school clubs as I trained. Even during lockdown I was creating digital learning tools. This place was my home and I’d followed the first rule to the letter to keep it. 

“Maybe you aren’t as bright as I thought.” He rolled his eyes. “Let’s list reasons a landlord might want to visit, shall we?

“Damage to property. Unauthorised modification of communal spaces. Digging around where it’s not wanted or needed. Nurturing my brothers unnatural experiments..” he went to continue but I stopped him. 

“What do you mean unnatural experiments?” 

Albert laughed even harder than before, I could see in his eyes that he considered me entirely dense by this stage. 

“You think those three little abominations you took in came out of nowhere? They were a cry for help, you stupid girl. Like a flare. And all you could do was pick it up and let it burn your fingers.” He scoffed, laughing at his own bad joke. My heart sunk wondering where the kittens were and if he’d hurt them.

“After all the trouble you caused when he helped you last time I wasn’t going to let my idiot brother continue to roam *my halls.* Especially not after what you did once he was gone.”

I gulped. I knew exactly what he was talking about. He knew that I knew as well, Albert was more than a few steps ahead of me. 

I realised that Prudence destroying his garden had probably never banished Derek at all. He had been kept prisoner by the man in front of me.  If Albert could keep someone with Derek’s knowledge and abilities trapped, then I didn’t stand a chance. 

“Shall we talk about *that thing* you keep in your bedroom, Kat?” 

“I didn’t mean to. I’m so sorry... I’ve regretted it since.” I stuttered. I felt a tear run down my cheek as I anticipated imminent death. 

“I know that. You wouldn’t have even known *how* if my brother had never told the last woman... and he pretends to be so pious.” The smile on his face had disappeared, even the thought of Derek left him with a scowl. 

“He just tried to help the residents here, please, I made a mistake.” I protested, anticipating that I was about to die or even worse. 

Albert didn’t speak, he just huffed in frustration and turned to walk towards the bedroom. I followed him, trying not to stay too close. The floor was trailed with blood and as he entered the room I noticed the wardrobe door was practically shattered. 

“You couldn’t even contain your mistake properly.” He gestured to Jamie who was in the corner, hunched over the blood smothered body of a kitten that he was crunching on the bones of. Tiny bits of muscle and skin in pools of blood, littered the floor.

His eyes were beady and black, any semblance of Jamie I’d once seen in them was gone. 

I noticed Tetley and Wrinkles shivering together in the opposite corner, trying to hide from the monster. The brief relief I felt that they hadn’t all met the same fate was interrupted when Jamie started to growl at Albert, baring his crimson splashed teeth as menacingly as he could. 

I watched in horror as Albert just stood there, staring at the increasingly angry beast.

The creature I had been hiding for all these months lunged at him aggressively, claws outstretched. Albert wasn’t phased. He barely even moved a muscle, just reached out a tattered sleeve and waited for Jamie to make contact with his hand. 

The second Jamie touched Albert he let out the most almighty, inhuman scream you could imagine. It felt like my eardrums were about to burst and I instinctively put my hands over them. Albert put his hand back down by his side as Jamie fell in a heap to the floor. 

He wasn’t moving. Not like when I’d stabbed him with the poker. He wasn’t just still, he was *dead* still. The heap of fur he had become started to morph on the floor, his jaw pulled inwards as if it were dislocating and his limbs began to stretch and shed their fur. 

After a while, Jamie was laid there on the floor. Not the rat Jamie, the real one. The one I’d spent years with and searched for a home with. The one who knew me before all this shit ever happened. 

And he was dead too. For real this time. 

It took everything I had not to throw myself on the floor with him. I stopped myself multiple times but Albert’s eyes bore into my soul and rendered me unable to move a muscle. I tried to fight back tears but I couldn’t. 

“Don’t bother to cry. He died a long time ago.” Albert kicked Jamie’s corpse and bent down into a squat to get closer to him. Not taking his eyes off me. “I didn’t let him out if that’s what you were thinking. No Kat. You did when you locked an angry animal in a cage, eventually they all get free.” I whimpered a little as he inspected the remains of my boyfriend, intensely taking in his hair and eyes. 

“My brother had this preconceived notion that humans can live in harmony with the evil that inhabits this building. He’s wrong, Kat. We can’t. Eventually it drives us all mad. Your mistake made such an unusual racket I had to come and see what was going on.

“Did you ever imagine keeping him like that before you lived here?” 

“Of course not -“ I tried to interject, but he wouldn’t let me. He was in full blown monologue. 

“This place fucks us up Kat. You can’t make it any better, regardless of how many shrubs you plant outside.” He stroked Jamie’s cold, dead face gently, barely touching it with his fingertips. 

The body evaporated beneath them, becoming nothing more than a pile of dust on my carpet. I hadn’t even got to touch him, one last time. Albert stood back up, salesman grin plastered back on his face, and brushed his sleeves. 

“I’ve cleaned up your mistake. Aren’t you going to say thank you?” 

I held back the bile that was forming in my throat, took a deep breath and summoned every ounce of strength that I could just to speak. He was right, this place had fucked me up. But losing your partner like that would do the same to anyone. I thought of the little boy in the mirror, Mr Prentice... even Ellie and Eddie. 

“*This* wasn’t for me. You’re wrong about this place, not everything here is evil. I made a mistake, but It’s you that’s evil, you killed your own son. What I did came from love.” I blurted, trying to organise my thoughts. 

“You don’t know a damn thing about my son. And you won’t. This is your only warning Kat, stop digging into my family. Consider my brother dead and keep quiet.” He spoke sternly, I didn’t dare try to talk back again, despite knowing I’d hit a nerve, everything about him set me on edge. 

He took another vicious stamp on part of the vine as he exited the bedroom, it shrivelled entirely underneath his dusty dress shoes, back to the size that it had been when I pulled my foot free, except it wasn’t green anymore, it was brown and rotten.

He turned to me once more before he reached the front door of the flat to leave and spoke.

“If you dare continue your pointless little mission to try and find Derek you will meet the same fate as that blind old bat from down the hall. People here will always do as I tell them.

“Let her be an example of why not to meddle in my family business. Feel lucky that I didn’t eviscerate you on the spot... or worse.” 

He winked at me, knowing that he had complete control of the situation and left with a simple “bye for now, Kat.”

As the door slammed the two remaining kittens bounded to my feet, shaking with fear. I scooped them up despite the burning and held them close. I wasn’t going to let anything happen to them. 

The flat had an emptiness I wasn’t used to, even when it had been just me with no kittens, before I repeated the ritual to bring Jamie back as a creature, there was the comforting knowledge that he existed somewhere. There was hope. The pile of dust on my bedroom floor and the shattered remains of my wardrobe were all I had left of him now. 

Then there were Mr Meow’s remains, a glaring reminder of my failure to keep anything alive or safe. I cried for him, as I scooped his parts into a shoebox ready to bury in the garden the next day. It was all my fault. Jamie, Mr Meow, Esther... they were all dead because of me. 

I considered calling Terri back, telling her what happened, but I decided to keep my mouth shut. My stupidity had already cost lives and I wasn’t prepared to risk her or the kids, they really were family to me. 

I wasn’t about to give up though. All the heartache I’d caused, The tears of Essie’s son and the months my boyfriend spent trapped in the body of a vile beast, maybe they wouldn’t be in vain if I was able to save Derek from his brother. The empty, gaping grief that I felt left me perfectly accepting of the prospect of a suicide mission. 

I cuddled the kittens and felt the skin of my arms start to melt and sizzle. If they really were a cry for help I had to listen. [I just couldn’t let it go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePickledGnome/comments/g1pldj/the_story_so_far/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
