My dad is a farmer. We live in a mountain village so our fields are in remote areas. I was out with some friends and he came to pick me up. Before going home we would stop at a field to turn the water on. It was 1 in the morning and pitch black outside but I was not afraid. I've been doing these thing since I was a little kid. We got there, my dad came out with a flashlight to go and turn on the water pump which we have to wait a few minutes to turn off. Now for me this was everyday things, I know the whole area like the palm of my hand. I knew who or what lived there. I was at my phone when I heard the loud noise of the pump and lifted my head up. I looked to the side view mirror and I saw my dads flashlight pointed to the board of buttons that operated the pump and the other stuff. The pump and the other machinery are all inside a little brick space with some metal sheets for a roof. Because it was remote the only source of electricity was from the generator we used to make the pump work. It had a small lamp but it didn't work due to it having not being changed in a year.

As I was waiting I heard the pump stop. My dads flashlight was coming closer, until it fell on the ground. Now there are a lot of wild animals there so I guessed he saw something and he dropped it out of fear. I opened the light of the car and took out a switchblade he has in the glove compartment for situations like this. I got out, I took the flashlight and aimed it at the valves he was looking at and they were untouched. I called out for him but no answer. My voice echoed like I was yelling my name on top of a mountain, you could hear it from meters away but he didn't. Something wasn't right. I saw something move behind the close to each other orange tree rows. It moved fast, faster than a human. It moved again switching trees so quickly like a beam of light. I quickly pointed the flashlight at the trees but it wasn't there. It took my dad. If it took with ease a 2 meters tall bulk man then I'm finished. I went to the car and locked everything. With the knife in my hands I slid the seat all the way back and I hid under it. I closed the flashlight and I could hear the orange trees shaking and branches breaking.

A sudden knock on the window. I cant look at it. I don't want to look at it. I want to see but I cant. I'm paralyzed by fear another knock. Knock. Knock. Then a voice. Similar to my fathers. Its telling me to come out and help it with some valves. I know its not dad. It cant be dad. I saw him with a pointy tree branch stabbed in him. Its a skinwalker. I've only heard about them. I turned my head up. It had the head of a deer. Red eyes. Painted horns. Marks in the eyes. I'm dead. I will never see the light of day again. I pushed the door open and I knocked it. It quickly got up. It dashed into me. I stabbed it. Its bleeding. It fell on the ground. I ran. I ran to the road. It followed me. I shined the flashlight and it turned to dust. Its light. Its weakness is light. How was it not dead back at the trees ? Is it because it is wounded ? Questions filled my brain as I tried to understand. I stopped. I turned back. It has dropped something. A wooden flask. I went closer to it. Shining my flashlight to it so it cant get it. I got it. I opened it and blood was inside. It became crazy when I opened it. I spilled it all to the floor. And i walked towards the light pole. 3 meters from there was a cabin. Its used by hunters. There will sure be guns there. But I cant go. There is no light. And my small flashlight is draining.

I want to kill it. For my dad. For the other 10 people who were reported lost in this same area. It cant terrorize us much longer. I snapped out of the shock and terror. It just happened. I got all my senses back. I got my strength. But I'm still too weak. The knife cant do anything. I'm gonna use its weapons against him. Who am I kidding. I cant play the hero. I don't stand a chance against it. I post this while sitting in the center of the light of the light pole waiting the morning. I may not see it. Goodbye
