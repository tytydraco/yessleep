The sirens started just after dinner, that long wounded-animal howl that makes your spine tighten even if you’ve heard it a hundred times. I was washing dishes at the sink. Karen, was wiping the table. The kids were arguing about who’d taken the last roll.

“Cellar, now!” I said. Not loud. Just firm. We practiced this.

We live on the edge of town, south side, where the fields open up and the sky feels bigger than it should. Missouri’s like that. Faith runs thick here. So does weather. I’d preached on storms before—how God sends rain on the just and unjust, how He’s a refuge. I believed it. I still do. 

The cellar door groaned like it always did. The steps were damp. I flicked on the light and the bulb buzzed. We filed down: Karen, then the kids—Eli fourteen, Ruth eleven, Caleb seven—then me, pulling the door closed. I latched it. I could feel the pressure change in my ears already.

The radio crackled. Tornado warning. Rotation confirmed. Take shelter immediately.

Karen reached for my hand. I could feel her shaking.

She leaned close so the kids wouldn’t hear it in her voice. “Darrell, what do we do now?”

I didn’t hesitate. “We rest in God.” I said with conviction. “Same as we always have.”

The wind started to thump against the house, low and heavy. Dust sifted from the joists.

I glanced at the kids huddled on the bench, eyes wide.

“Come here, guys.” They huddled in, knees touching. “Let’s pray.”

We bowed our heads. I asked God to cover our home, to put His hand between us and the storm. I said we trusted Him. I meant it. The wind began to scream overhead, a freight train sound like the old folks say, only louder than any train I’ve ever heard.

Something hit the house. The walls shuddered. Dirt sifted from the ceiling and dusted our shoulders. Ruth started to cry. I kept praying. I prayed louder.

Then, as sudden as it came, the sound pulled away. The pressure eased. The radio said the cell had lifted, jogged east, spared the town center. By morning, we climbed out to broken branches and a torn-up fence. No roof gone. No walls down. Praise God.

At church that Sunday, the sanctuary was packed. Folks cried and hugged. We sang louder than usual. The pastor said we’d been spared for a reason. I nodded. I thought of the prayer in the cellar and felt sure I’d been heard.

It started with a rash on Eli’s arm. Red, angry, like poison ivy but wetter. We tried calamine. Then antibiotics from the urgent care. The skin broke open anyway. It smelled wrong. Sweet and sour at the same time.

Karen got a spot on her neck two days later. Then Caleb’s ankle. People around town started showing up with bandages, with scarves in warm weather. The ER filled up. The state called in help. Men in white hazmat suits started knocking on doors.

A woman from the CDC took swabs. She didn’t meet my eyes. “We’re asking everyone to stay inside,” she said. “This is temporary.”

It wasn’t.

Karen’s skin darkened around the wound, sloughing like wet paper. She tried to joke. “Guess I won’t be wearing my Sunday dress,” she said. Then she cried when she thought I wasn’t looking.

They set up roadblocks. National Guard trucks idled at the exits. Phones buzzed with rumors. Bioterror. Judgment. I prayed more. I asked what lesson we were supposed to learn.

They didn’t gather us in person. Instead, everyone logged into a town-wide Zoom call, faces boxed and jittery, microphones muting and unmuting. A man with gray hair and tired eyes filled the main screen. The audio lagged for a second before he spoke, his voice flat and careful, like every word had been rehearsed.

“We believe the tornado aerosolized topsoil from an agricultural area and dispersed Mucorales spores present in it over the town.”

A woman unmuted herself. “What’s that mean?”

The scientist hesitated, fingers tight on the mic. “It’s… complicated.”

I pulled my phone out, thumbs clumsy. Mucar—? Mucor—? Autocorrect fixed it. I clicked the first result and felt my throat tighten.

I unmuted myself and read out loud. “Mucormycosis,” I said. “A rare but serious fungal infection. Causes tissue death. Sometimes called—”

I swallowed. “Flesh-eating black fungus.”

The call went very quiet. 

“There's no reason to be alarmed...” the scientist tried to reassure us. “We’re working on antifungals. Containment is critical.”

I thought of the prayer. Of the storm turning away from the heart of town, like a finger lifted at the last second.

Eli didn’t last the week. The infection moved fast once it reached his shoulder. He tried to be brave. “Dad,” he said, voice thin, “did I do something wrong?”

“No, son...” I told him. “Jesus loves you.”

When they took his body, they sealed the bag tight. I could still smell that wrong sweetness in the house.

Karen followed two days later. Then Ruth. I held Caleb on the night when his fever spiked. I prayed harder than I ever had. I begged God to spare just one of my children. 

Caleb died before dawn.

I’m alone now. Quarantine tape still flaps at the end of the street. The fields are quiet. The sky is clear. I sit in the cellar with the radio off and the Bible open, staring at words about refuge and mercy.

I turn to a page I don’t remember marking. Job, thin paper whispering.

“The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away...”

Below it, I saw another verse: “Shall we accept good from God, and not trouble?”

I close the book.

My fingers itch. The skin near my wrist has gone soft, darker than it should be. It smells faintly sweet. 

I’m not afraid anymore.

I pray that God receives me. I take comfort in the quiet promise of seeing my family again in [Heaven](https://www.reddit.com/r/PageTurner627Horror/).
