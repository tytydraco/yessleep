Hi everyone, this is the first time I'm posting something in reddit. I've been reading a lot of stories in here so thought why not share one myself.

So this happened years ago, back when I was in an all-girls high school. Ours was one of those old convent-style buildings with long corridors, high ceilings, and classrooms that always smelled faintly of chalk and disinfectant. The kind of place where every creak makes you pause.

We had one janitor... A woman, Mrs. Joy. Short, round glasses, always humming old songs under her breath while she worked. She was sweet, always smiling, and everyone loved her.

But one evening, I stayed back late to help decorate for the school fest. Most of the others had already gone home. Only the faint sound of fans whirring filled the empty classrooms.

I was carrying a box of origami flowers down the corridor when I heard it. The sound of a mop bucket squeaking on the floor.

It came from the old wing... The one that was supposedly under renovation.

At first, I thought it was Mrs. Joy finishing her rounds. But when I turned the corner, I froze.

It wasn’t her.

It was a man.

He was tall and thin, wearing a grey shirt and blue overalls, with a metal bucket and mop that looked decades old. He didn’t even glance at me... Just kept mopping in slow, mechanical strokes. The hallway lights flickered above him like they were afraid to stay on.

“Sir?” I asked, voice shaky.

He didn’t answer.

And when I stepped closer, I realized something was wrong... The floor beneath his mop was dry. Completely dry.

I backed away and left without another word.

The next morning, I mentioned it to one of the teachers... Half-joking, half-hoping she’d tell me it was just a new hire.

But she frowned. “A man? That’s not possible. We’ve only ever had women janitors here. School policy.”

I told her I was sure. I described him in detail. The shirt, the overalls, the squeaky bucket.

Her face changed. “That sounds like Mr. Freddy,” she said quietly.

“Who’s that?”

“He used to work here. Years ago. Before the convent reopened that wing.”

I felt my stomach drop. “What happened to him?”

She hesitated before answering. “He slipped while cleaning one of the upper classrooms. Broke his neck. They found him the next morning. No one’s been allowed to clean that section since and just says it's under renovation”

I didn’t believe it... Or maybe I didn’t want to.

So that evening, I stayed late again. On purpose.

When the building grew quiet, I walked toward the old wing. Every step echoed too loud.

And at 7:30 pm, the same squeak echoed from the hall.

I followed it. My hands were shaking, but I needed to see for myself.

The hallway lights flickered as I turned the corner... And there he was. Same spot. Same motion.

But this time, I stayed hidden behind a door frame and watched. He mopped for a while, then suddenly stopped. Then he lifted his head and turned toward me.

His face wasn’t right.

The skin on one side was sunken in, like it had collapsed inward. His eye was glazed, milky white, and the corner of his mouth hung unnaturally low, like he’d been frozen mid-fall.

I remember whispering, “Sir?”

He looked straight at me and said, in this raspy, gurgled voice,

“Be careful. Wet floors are dangerous.”

Then he turned and walked through the wall.

And of course I bolted out of the school grounds right away. Haven't stayed back alone at school since.
