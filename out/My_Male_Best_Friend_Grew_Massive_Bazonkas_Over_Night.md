I know what you're thinking by reading the title of this post; surely this is some kind of joke, a meme, a fake story someone would write to make a few people on the subreddit of a creepy pasta podcast happy, right?

But I assure you, this is all true and happened to me many years ago when I was 18. My friend Zach and I had both just finished College, unsure of what to do with our lives now besides spending our time out of education sitting in my garage playing Nintendo and smoking pot. As great as it was for a few weeks, it wasn't a viable carer choice.

"Let's check the paper for jobs" I suggested to Zach one day, half baked and stuck at the Water Temple in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

"We can also head into town tomorrow, see if anyone has any positions posted up somewhere"

"Sounds good" Zach replied, rather unenthusiastically.

We'd been practically inseparable ever since childhood, spending most weekends and school holidays together.  He was always cheerful, cracking jokes (usually at my expense) and getting us into trouble with the neighbours and occasionally the police. Nothing serious, just being dumb nuisances.

But something was off with him tonight. He'd been acting off, much quieter than usual and his face seemed grim, as if some heavy burden was pressing down hard on his chest.

"Don't sound too excited". I turned to him and that's when I noticed something odd. His shirt, which he always brought a size too small to exaggerate the make believe muscles he tried to show off, was stretched out awkwardly across three swollen lumps protruding from his chest.

"What the hell?" I half laughed, thinking it was some sort of joke. But Zach didn't laugh and as he looked down at the gargantuan behemoths trying to bust through his shirt, I saw his face go pale and his eyes grow wide in fear and confusion. He violently pulled off his shirt, revealing three monstrous boobies, growing before our bewildered eyes to an unnatural size.

"I don't... I don't know what's happening to me" Zach muttered, his voice quivering.

Before I could say anything, he jolted up and ran out of my garage and into the night, his arms trying desperately to contain the colossal weapons hanging from his chest, their thunderous applause as they slapped together in his arms echoed through the night.

"Zach!" I yelled after him as he left, distracted by the size of the absolute units he held against him, the choir of boobies draining out all other thoughts in my head. I chased him, but he was always quicker than I was, even with the additional weight from the spontaneous melons.

I didn't hear from Zach for over a week. None of our mutual friends or even his own parents had heard from him since. I wanted to tell them what happened but how could I? I told them as much as I thought they would believe, I told them he had seemed off and ran away somewhere, leaving out the giant knockers he had grown from no where. That's not something that just comes out of nowhere in seconds. Of course they continued to question me when that's all I could give them, as did the police when they were brought in after it turned into an official disappearance.

But then one day, I received a letter. There was no address written on it, just my name. I opened it with a morbid curiosity and it wasn't until I finished reading it that I realised it was him who had written it. It was written in shaky, almost frantic handwriting. It read:

"Marcus, i've joined them. The Circus. They said they could help me. I don't know if I'll be the same when I come back. If I even come back. Don't tell anyone and don't come find me".

I must have read that letter a dozen times. I couldn't make sense of it. Why would he tell me where he'd gone if he didn't want me or anyone to know where he was? Why didn't he want anyone to know where he was? What fucking Circus? And what could they do to help him and his massive bazonkas? I grabbed my bike and headed into town, maybe there'd be a poster or some kind of advertisement around to tell me where he'd gone. It wasn't long until I found it. A poster for Circus Simia.

I found it after an hour or so, tucked away on the outskirts of town, almost like it was hiding out here. Seemed like a strange place to set up a Circus if the idea was to get people in to see it. But of course, they didn't want to be found unless they wanted YOU to find them. Not that it was much of a Circus, just one large red and yellow tent out in the middle of nowhere. It opened seemingly on it's own as I approached.

I entered and was greeted by a green flame, surrounded by a dozen small monkeys. They paid no attention to me as I approached. They were deep in a trance, chanting in a language I didn't understand. How could I, they were monkeys after all.

As I got close to the fire, I saw Zach laying motionless on the floor the opposite side of the Circus tent, he too was surrounded by monkeys. His boobies sagged around him, engulfing his entire body now.

"What are you doing to him?" I yelled. "Leave his glorious milkers alone!"

With my outburst, the monkeys awoke from their trance. They moved in unison, surrounding me. One of them stepped forward.

"You have come" a deep voice echoed in my head. While their mouths had not moved, it must have been the monkeys.

But the voice laughed as the thought crossed my mind.

"Oh no dear boy, they are just mindless puppets bewildered by my beauty, as are you"

I turned back to Zach. His unconscious body was held in the air by the side boobies and the middle one raised high into the ground, its ungodly nipple staring deep into my soul.

"You were the intended host, but this vessel has served it's purpose well until now."

The boobies leaned forward, hoovering directly over the fire. They had grown again, now completely covering Zach. There was nothing left of him now but his big ol' borrascas.

"You will join us now"

"NO!" I yelled, breaking from my titty induced trance. Realising the friend I had was gone, I pushed the Lovecraftian boob monster back into the flame. It screamed in my mind as it set ablaze, its side boobs flapping and igniting the tent around it. The monkeys fled from the blazing tent as did I, fleeing into the night.

The flame subsided as quickly as it began, leaving nothing but ash behind in it's wake. The breasted horror was gone, but it had taken my friend with it. Or had I? Grief and guilt flooded my mind. Had I just killed my closest friend, or was he lost to the Great Boob before I had reached him? No, I had seen him lifeless and covered in boob when I arrived. Maybe it wasn't him who had delivered the letter, you could teach a monkey to write, right?

I headed home to pack my things and left town that night. I spent years drifting, doing odd jobs here and there trying to find a purpose. Eventually the grief had subsided and was replaced with a new feeling. A longing for something greater, a desire to help others. The horrors I had faced that week had seemed impossible but yet, they were real. They were my life. And that's when I found my calling.

Eventually I found others with the same desire, the same drive to make sure no one else ended up like Zach,  taken by some abomination, some creature that goes bump in the night.

I, Marcus, have become a monster hunter.
