I should’ve kept driving.

That’s what I keep thinking, over and over. If I had just kept my foot on the gas, if I hadn’t listened to Casey whining about having to piss, if I hadn’t let Jonah convince me that a burger sounded better than gas station jerky, they’d still be here. I wouldn’t be sitting in a motel two towns over, red-eyed and shaking, waiting for the cops to show up and tell me I’m crazy.

It was just supposed to be a quick stop.

We’d been driving for hours, cutting through the kind of empty stretches of road where the airwaves don’t bother carrying radio signals. No signs of life except the occasional distant farmhouse, a rusting tractor sinking into the fields. I don’t even remember when we passed the last town. Maybe an hour back, maybe more.

Then the diner appeared on the horizon line.

*Mel’s Eats.* The sign flickered like it hadn’t been changed in decades, the letters half burned out. The parking lot was empty, not even a rusted-out truck or an old junker parked around back. But the lights were on. The neon buzzed against the growing dark.

“Pull over.” Casey smacked the back of my seat. “I’ve got to piss.”

“That place looks creepy.”

“It looks like they have a bathroom. And unless you want me going in a bottle, you should pull in.”

Slowly, I veered off the road and into the dusty parking lot. Even though the lights were on, I didn’t see anyone through the front windows.

Jonah was the first one out. “Come on. Let’s grab some real food before we have to suffer through another gas station hot dog.”

Casey laughed, already jogging toward the front doors, and I hesitated for just a second. It was too quiet. A place like this, even in the middle of nowhere, should’ve had someone inside. A waitress, a cook, a guy nursing a coffee and reading the paper. Pick a movie trope, it should have been there. But there was nothing.

The diner was normal. Checkerboard floors, vinyl booths with peeling cushions, a jukebox against the wall that looked like it hadn’t played a song in years. The lights were too bright. Everything was spotless, but no one was there.

Jonah whistled, the sound too loud in the silence. “Maybe they’re out back?”

Casey drummed her hands against the counter. “I don’t know, guys. This feels weird.”

“I’m with Casey on this. It feels weird.” I gestured over my shoulder. “We should just ditch it.”

“I’m hungry,” Jonah insisted. “Hey! Hey, come on. You’ve got starving customers out here! Unless you want me to start helping myself, I would come take my order.”

No answer.

Jonah pushed through the swinging kitchen door. “Let’s just check,” he said. “If no one’s here, we bail.”

“Of course no one’s here. They didn’t answer.” I followed anyway, Casey right behind me. The kitchen was immaculate. Shiny steel counters, pots hanging on the walls, an old black-and-white menu board that still had prices from the ‘80s. But the smell was God awful.

Rot. Thick and cloying, like meat left out too long. I gagged, covering my mouth, and then Jonah made a sound—something between a choke and a curse, muffled behind the hand he’d just slapped over his own face. He jabbed a finger toward the center of the room and my gaze followed.

The thing on the floor barely looked real.

It was half-crushed, like something heavy had fallen on it. Its body was stretched and wrong, too many joints in its limbs, its skin waxy and split open like an overripe fruit. Its head—God, its head—was somewhere between a dog and an insect, a long snout lined with jagged teeth, with eyes that were bulbous and black. Its legs ended in curled, chitinous claws, and its torso…

The torso was still twitching.

I took a step back. “What the *fuck* is that?”

Jonah turned, face pale. “We need to go.”

Casey made a wet, gasping noise, her hand clamped over her mouth. “Guys—”

Then we heard it.

A low, vibrating hum.

The walls seemed to shake with it, the sound drilling straight into my skull. Casey clutched at her ears. Jonah shoved past us, barreling through the kitchen door, and I followed on instinct.

We ran for the car, shoving the front doors open so hard they nearly broke off their hinges.

The air was filled with movement.

Shapes crawled down the sides of the building, skittering from the shadows. Limbs too long, mandibles clicking, those bulbous black eyes reflecting the neon light like polished glass. A dozen. More. They poured from the roof, from the darkness beyond the parking lot, their bodies snapping into place like broken puppets.

I ran.

I didn’t look back not even when I heard Jonah cursing, heard Casey scream as something heavy hit the gravel. I heard the snap of bone. Wet tearing flesh.

I *didn’t look back*.

I was in the driver’s seat, hands shaking as I jammed the key in the ignition. A shadow slammed against the windshield, something clawing at the glass. My headlights caught a flash of teeth, clicking, grinding together.

I reversed so hard my tires screamed, peeling out onto the road. I don’t know if Jonah or Casey were still moving. I don’t know if they were screaming, if they called my name.

I was a coward.

I was already gone.

The highway blurred past me. My hands felt numb. I didn’t stop driving until I reached the next town, my entire body shaking. When I finally pulled over, I threw up onto the pavement.

I tried telling the cops. They looked at me like I was insane. Sent a car out there. Came back empty-handed. No bodies. No blood. They said the diner was fine. They were lying. Why were they lying? Do they know what’s out there? Did they know from the start?

No one is talking about this. I keep thinking I hear something—right at the edge of my hearing. That low, vibrating hum.

It’s getting louder.

I think they’re going to be here soon, at this town. I don’t know. I just...wanted someone to know what happened. If they lie about what happens to me, know that it was the creatures we found in the diner.

Know that I was here.
