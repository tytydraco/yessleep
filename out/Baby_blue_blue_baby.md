I always knew Claythorne Boarding School was old, but it never felt *ancient* until that night—the night Adelaide convinced us to try the Blue Baby ritual. Maybe it was the way the wind rattled the windows, or the way the hallway lights flickered as if trying to warn us. Or maybe it was just the way Adelaide smiled when she suggested we break into the girls’ bathroom after curfew. Her smiles always meant trouble.

We slipped inside and locked the door behind us. The metallic *click* of the lock echoed far too loudly in the tiled room.

“All lights off,” Elliot reminded us, already sounding nervous.

Cameron flipped the switch, plunging everything into solid blackness. Darkness so complete I couldn’t see my own hand in front of my face. I felt the others shift around me, trying to find their marks by memory.

The bathroom mirror stretched across the wall like a portal, faintly reflecting what scraps of moonlight squeezed through the frosted window. In that dimness, we formed a crooked line before it—four silhouettes in a row.

My voice trembled before I even spoke. “I still think this is a bad idea.”

Cameron bumped my shoulder. “Rosabella, relax. It’s just a dumb school legend.”

“Yeah,” Adelaide chimed in, her tone too excited. “Besides, we’re all doing it together. Nothing bad’s gonna happen.”

That was the first lie of the night.

We lifted our arms into the ritual pose, as though rocking invisible babies. My elbows trembled slightly; I hoped no one noticed. Elliot cleared his throat.

“Okay,” he whispered. “Remember—don’t fumble the chant. Thirteen times. Perfectly.”

My heart thudded. I could feel it in my teeth.

We faced the mirror and began.

“Baby Blue, Blue Baby…”

The chorus sounded wrong in the dark—too unified, too hollow. As we chanted, faint outlines of our reflections took shape, like they were surfacing slowly from underwater.

“Baby Blue, Blue Baby…”

Every time the phrase left my lips, the dark seemed to thicken. The air grew colder, heavy with something that didn’t feel like air at all.

“Baby Blue, Blue Baby…”

Around the ninth repetition, I felt Cameron shift beside me.

“Rosabella…” he whispered, “you’re shaking.”

“I’m fine,” I lied.

We finished the thirteenth chant together, the final words dissolving into the stale bathroom silence.

Then came the moment no one prepared me for.

At first, it felt like a faint pressure on my forearms—like someone had placed a bundle of cloth across them. The weight grew heavier, colder, until goosebumps crawled to the back of my neck.

Elliot gasped. “Oh my God—she has it. Look!”

I didn’t want to look. I *refused* to look. But the mirror forced me to. Reflected there—barely visible in the dim glow—was a bluish lump in my arms. Not quite shaped like a baby, but shifting, pulsing faintly as if something inside it breathed.

My throat dried instantly.

Adelaide whispered, “Holy crap… Rosabella, you’re holding it.”

The thing *moved*.

I nearly screamed. Its tiny fingers curled around my wrist like threads of ice. My knees almost buckled.

The rules echoed in my mind: **Flush the baby. Get rid of it before the mother comes.**

I stumbled backward until I hit the toilet stall door. My hands shook wildly as I pushed it open. The weight in my arms grew denser, more solid—like real flesh.

Something cold brushed my cheek.

I lifted the lid, swallowing a sob. If I hesitated, even for a second—

*BANG!*

A fist slammed against the bathroom door from the outside.

"Who’s in there?" A teacher’s voice cut sharply through the dark.

The overhead lights burst on with a harsh electric buzz.

And the baby vanished.

The weight disappeared so suddenly I lurched forward. The four of us screamed in overlapping panic. The teacher shoved the door open, face tight with fury.

“What are you doing in here? It’s nearly midnight!”

Her voice sounded far away. Because over her shoulder, the mirror caught my attention.

At first I thought the lighting had done something strange to our reflections. But then I saw *her*—just behind us, standing in the mirror.

A woman. Pale skin stretched taut over sharp cheekbones. Wet, stringy hair dripping onto her gown. Eyes sunken, dark—burning with a mother’s grief and rage. Her mouth hung slightly open, as though mid-scream, though no sound escaped.

She stared directly at me.

I blinked.

She was gone.

Adelaide grabbed my wrist, dragging me out of the bathroom before the teacher could scold us further. The hallway felt too bright, too quiet, too normal.

But as we hurried away, something icy brushed the back of my neck—like a hand reaching for what I had taken, what I had tried to flush away.

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t have to.

Because in every reflective surface we passed—every window, every glass trophy case—I caught glimpses of her pale figure just behind us.

The ghost mother was following.

And she wasn’t going to stop.
