The room was dark and cold as I stepped inside. The air smelled musty like it had been closed up for years. It wasn't until I got to the kitchen that I realized how long ago this place might have actually been abandoned. There were still dishes piled high in the sink with dried food stuck between them. A box full of moldy cereal sat next to an empty bottle of milk. On top of the fridge there was a note written by someone named "Molly." She said she would be back soon but didn't explain why or when. I don't know what happened to her after that because I never saw another sign of life again. As far as I knew, I was alone here. That's not entirely true though. Every night at midnight something else wakes up. Something hungry. And every morning you can find me lying face down in a pool of blood.

I'd just finished cleaning out all the old food from the refrigerator before I noticed the smell. My first thought was rotting meat. Then I heard it. From outside. Some kind of growling sound. At least two voices joined together in unison. They weren't human. Not even close. Whatever they were made their way through the window without making any noise. Their claws scratched against the glass as if trying to get inside.
I grabbed one of the knives from the countertop and ran toward the front door. I could see movement behind the curtains but nothing came through the windows. Maybe whatever it was couldn't fit? Or maybe it only comes out during the day? Either way, I needed to get away while I still could.

I opened the front door slowly so as not to make too much noise. When I did, I found myself staring right into its eyes. Its body was covered in thick black fur. Two small horns grew above each eye. One red, one blue. Both pointed straight ahead. This thing looked more beast than anything else. It let out a low growl which seemed to shake the very walls around us. Before I could react, it jumped forward and knocked me over onto the floor. It landed on top of me, pinning me under its weight. It growled louder now, almost laughing at me. I tried kicking it off but it wouldn't budge. All I managed to do was scratch my leg up pretty bad. But then suddenly it stopped moving completely. For some reason, I felt safe underneath it. Like we were both waiting for something. After a few seconds, I started to hear footsteps coming closer. Someone was walking towards our home.
When whoever it is finally arrived, he stood directly across from where I lay. He wore a hooded robe similar to mine. Only his was white instead of gray. His arms hung limp at his sides. Even though he appeared to be standing perfectly still, I could tell he was breathing heavily. He kept glancing over to the creature beneath him. Finally, he spoke.
"What…what is going on?"
I wanted to answer him but the words caught in my throat. Instead, I simply stared at him.
"Why isn't it dead yet?" he asked.

He turned around and walked past me. I watched him go upstairs. Just moments later, I heard a loud bang followed by screaming. It sounded like Molly. The guy went downstairs and pulled the monster off me. I scrambled to my feet and ran outside. By the time I reached the porch, the screams had cut off. I climbed up the stairs and entered the living room. What greeted me was a scene straight out of hell itself. The man was kneeling beside the woman's corpse. Blood dripped from his hands and stained the carpet below. The monster was nowhere to be seen. In fact, none of the furniture had been touched. Everything was exactly as it should have been. Except for the bloody knife laying on the ground next to the couch.

I approached the man cautiously. "Are you okay?" I asked.
He didn't respond.
"Hey," I said. "Are you alright?"
Still nothing.
"What happened?” I said again.
Finally, he responded. "She woke up."
"Who woke up?" I asked.
"The lady. Her name's Molly. She was my girlfriend. A few years ago we broke into this house and found a strange spell books.” He replied.
"So what does molly have to do with the beast?" I inquired.
"We were just bored and ended up doing some of the incantations." He said.
"So you summoned the beast?" I asked.
"We released some kind of demon, it possessed molly, she is the beast.” He responded gently.
Deftly i spoke. "So wait...you're saying you just killed your own girlfriend?"
He nodded his head. "Yes. I did kill her. I had to. Had to make up for leaving her here like a coward."
"That’s honestly really rough man but what about the demon?” I asked with as much tact as I could muster.
“It’s spirit lingers in this house, I’m going to burn the place down.” He answered surely.
Surprised I shouted out. “Hold up man this is my house you can’t be serious, isn’t there another way?”
“Are you an idiot? There is no time we must finish this while we can, before anyone else has to die.” He retorted quickly.
“Your right, let’s do this.” I reply after a moment of silence.
“Good, there’s gasoline in my car outside let’s get started.” He says.

I ran down the steps and headed toward the garage. The man followed closely behind. We emptied several cans and returned to the house. Once inside, we lit everything on fire. The flames quickly spread throughout the entire structure. Quietly one could hear demonic anguish as fire truck sirens began to blare. Soon enough, the whole neighborhood was alerted to the situation.
I stayed in the kitchen watching the inferno. The man sat down next to me. "You really think that will work?"
"Hope so… and I’m sorry about your friend." I said.
He nodded. "Me too. She was nice.”
“What’s your name if you don’t mind?” I asked.
"I'm Sam." He replied.
"Nice to meet you Sam. I’m Mike." I said with a smile.
