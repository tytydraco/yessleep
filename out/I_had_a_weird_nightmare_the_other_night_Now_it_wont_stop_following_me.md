I’m in the middle of what should be a normal week - but a couple nights ago, It was transformed into something I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy.

A couple days ago, everything was fine. Hell, looking at travel plans to visit family was the only thing with even a molecule of stress attached to it in my life. Which wa a nice break. But then, I went to sleep that night. Now I’m in desperate need of another break.

In the dream I had that night, I found myself in an abandoned laundromat. I don’t know what on Earth I was doing there (every apartment I’ve lived in has a washer/dryer unit with it, I’ve never even been to a laundromat) or where it was, just that it was in a barren field with no other buildings around. As it was abandoned, it was a little dilapidated. Cracks in the walls, in the machines, and most notably, the bottom of the doorframe. I didn’t pay any mind to them, except for the one at the bottom of the doorframe. It felt like something was watching me from there. Eventually, curiosity got the better of me, and I looked down the crack in the doorframe.

And quickly looked away, when I saw it staring back at me.

There was an enormous eye in the crack. Like a whale’s eye. The size, shape - everything about it could only be compared to that.

When I retreated from the doorframe, I started to feel like all of the cracks staring at me. My heart was pounding. I couldn’t look back at them. I knew that I couldn’t even think about looking at them. If I looked back at them, they woul

And then I shot awake. I never got to finish the thought of what would happen if they saw me look back. Looking back at it, I wish I stayed awake for just a serving more, to listen what I had in store for the next few days. But then I forgot about it at the time, because it turned out I woke up at 4:30 AM, long before my alarm. Great start to my morning, right?

I couldn’t get much sleep after that.

The following day, I was still shaken up by that dream. It felt like that gut churning thing was still staring at me. But, I still got through my day just fine. Until I spotted a crack in the concrete I was walking home from work on that confirmed my suspicion. Out of the corner of my own, I saw that sickening eye. But still, I felt in my bones that it’d be a far worse than death if I stared back. So I just kept walking while keeping my eyes fixated on my phone until I could return home

I tried to continue living normally after that, but it started showing up in every damn crack I saw. But I couldn’t look back at it. In my soul, there was one feeling blaring every time I tried mustering up the courage to stare back: “I’d rather die”. I swear, I’m starting to see it in more than just cracks as well. Like in my lamp the other day - the bulb was gone. The eye was there. And I just ignored it. I’ve stopped eating and drinking with my eyes open to avoid seeing it while vulnerable. 

I just hope this is as bad as it get. But with it showing up everywhere I look, I’m starting to dread that trip to visit family. Being trapped in a plane for upwards of 12 hours and needing to figure out where I can or can’t look sounds nightmarish to say the least. 

I’ve tried mentioning it to coworkers, but no one knows what I’m talking about. Please, someone help me. Before I slip up and end up opening my eyes just to be staring straight into the eyes of that wretched thing.
