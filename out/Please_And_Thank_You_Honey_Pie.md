I do *not* celebrate Halloween and I do *not* allow my children to celebrate Halloween!

&#x200B;

Really, it’s a vile ‘holiday’ and I don’t think there’s any greater indication of how far our society has fallen than its celebration and commercialization. It’s disturbing to see it everywhere all throughout the month of October. Ghosts, demons, vampires, werewolves, witches… abominations, depictions of the occult. *Sin.* 

&#x200B;

People say it’s all fun and games, but I know the truth. It’s not. It’s spiritual warfare and it comes in the most sinister costume of all, childrens fun. 

&#x200B;

Tell me, how exactly are demons fun? How exactly do people enjoy the feelings of being scared? What kinds of sick people watch movies where men with machetes and chainsaws carve up mindless teenagers (morally bankrupt teenagers, yes, but Gods children all the same) and say: ‘*Ah yes, this is true entertainment!*’ It’s *twisted! It’s demonic!*

&#x200B;

How is it that so few people see this?

&#x200B;

Really think about this for a moment, why is it acceptable that for one month out of the year we glorify such dark and demonic things? Why is it that for one month, the worship of Satan and his minions is seen as acceptable? And why, why, *why* would you expose your *children* to it?

&#x200B;

Satan should not be glorified! Satan should *never* be glorified, and he most certainly should never be glorified to *children!*

&#x200B;

So I *don’t* partake in Halloween and I as a mother of two gifts, I *don’t* allow my children to partake in it either! Too many people say it’s just harmless fun, but I know better. *I know better!* Once you recognize the signs of spiritual warfare you should be wise enough to stay far away from it.

&#x200B;

I’d like to see myself as a moral compass for my community. My voice of reason may not always be welcomed but it is necessary and I have made a commitment to use my life to steer people towards the open arms of Jesus. It is a thankless job, but I do it because I care. People tend to get upset when the word of God is shared with them, but the word of God is rarely pleasant for the sinner to hear. The stern words of a parent are never soothing to a child, but they must be heard and heeded all the same.

&#x200B;

Thanks to me, my little town in Maine has flourished. I took steps to remove problematic books from our schools, I have successfully shut down some events that I did not deem appropriate for a Godly community and I have even enlisted my Church to aid me in protesting the presence of undesirable community members, pressuring them to leave our community and find some other place to pollute. Needless to say, I am experienced with solving problems in my community and when I saw the Halloween display that Diana Warwick had put up, I knew that something needed to be done about it.

&#x200B;

Halloween has always been a troublesome time of year for me. My husband, Hugh and I have campaigned to ban putting up decorations, but it’s been one of our less successful efforts. That said - my past efforts had successfully made some people dial back their decorations and while a few had challenged me before, I had remained steadfast with the Lord at my back. 

&#x200B;

Diana had not lived in our little community for long, so I doubt she realized my devotion to my cause and prior to Halloween she had done nothing to agitate me. She did not go to church (at least not my church) but she kept to herself and seemed content to be left well enough alone. I would have loved to see her seek salvation, but since she had not disturbed the peace, I was content to leave her be. 

&#x200B;

Of course, when the decorations came up, I knew something needed to be done. The display in front of her house was nothing short of *grotesque.* 

&#x200B;

She had decorated the trees in her front yard with cheap fake cobwebs and fake looking spiders, which while offensive, were still relatively tame. The small makeshift cemetery she’d put in her garden wasn’t quite as tame, but it was still something I wouldn’t have raised that much of a fuss over.

&#x200B;

But the thing that really set her decorations apart from the others were the four sculptures scattered around her yard. Diana apparently seemed to fancy herself as something of an artist, since the statues in her yard were clearly homemade. No store would have dared stock something so vile. They resembled human figures, although their limbs were long and spindly, giving them an almost sickly look. Their faces had pronounced, mournful features and their bodies were overgrown with moss, although beneath that moss, one could make out the strange runes that had been carved into their bodies. It was hard to tell if they were truly occult, or simply intended to emanate the occult.

&#x200B;

Though none of them stood up to their full height (they were all either crouched or on the ground) each one easily towered over a full grown man. They dwarfed my husband completely. I’m really not sure how she even moved such things around. Perhaps they we hollow, or they disassembled?

&#x200B;

Either way, they were truly *horrifying* to look at. Twisted, surreal demonic things, lurking around her trees, their ominous nature only enhanced by the changing of the autumn leaves around them. Driving down the hill that led to our street, you could see them in the distance. The first time I laid eyes on them, they darn near gave me a heart attack! My eldest son, Haon (that’s Noah backwards, we wanted him to stand out) kept staring at them. He said they were: ‘so cool’ but I knew that deep down his angels soul was terrified. I had to forbid him from getting closer, simply for his own protection! And my youngest son, Revilo was terrified of them, saying he was afraid that the monsters were going to come into his room at night to eat him! 

&#x200B;

I don’t understand *how* anyone would have thought it was appropriate to put something so disturbing in their yard, even for Halloween, but something needed to be done so I marched over there to try and resolve this amicably. 

&#x200B;

I knocked on her door the day after she put those awful decorations up to have a little chat with her. 

&#x200B;

She answered the door on my second knock, greeting me with a smile. She was, admittedly, an attractive woman, somewhere in her mid thirties. She had lovely long, brown hair, perfectly rounded features and somewhat sultry brown eyes. It was a shame, since beauty really was squandered on her. She had no husband or children of her own and stuck me as more of a career woman. Such a waste… people like that really don’t contribute anything to society. The childless have so little stake in the future and I really don’t understand why suffrage isn’t limited to parents, it’s the only way society is realistically workable in the long term… but I digress. For a wasted woman, she seemed nice enough when speaking to her in passing.

&#x200B;

  “Oh, hey! It’s Karen, right?” She asked. Her tone was friendly and seemed inoffensive, although the fact that she called me that name did make my blood boil a little.

  “It’s Sarah, actually,” I said. 

&#x200B;

She looked momentarily confused, and I got the impression that she truly *did* believe my name was Karen… she wouldn’t be the first newcomer to make that mistake, unfortunately. Some of the children at my sons middle school had taken to calling me that after some ridiculous internet meme  and unfortunately, I hadn’t been able to get them to stop. Even threatening to call my lawyer didn’t dissuade them and by the time I *did* call him, the name had stuck.

  “Oh, I’m so sorry!”

  “An honest mistake,” I assured her. I suppose we’d only spoken a handful of times before, so expecting her to fully remember my name may have been expecting too much of her. “I hope I’m not troubling you right now, I just wanted to take some time and talk about the decorations you have out front.”

&#x200B;

  “Oh, those?” She asked, her smile a little prideful. “Yeah, they’re really something, aren’t they?”

  “Indeed,” I replied tonelessly. “They’re quite disturbing.”

  “If you want to bring the kids by to take a look at them, I don’t mind! They’re mostly just made of old wood.”

  “My children are terrified of them.” I said firmly. “God bless you, really. But those *things* are just… they’re far too much! You really shouldn’t have them up!”

&#x200B;

Her expression darkened a tad, but her smile didn’t fade.

  “You don’t think so?” She asked. “It’s just a little bit of seasonal fun.”

  “It’s not fun when it’s terrifying passing children.”

  “They’re not that scary. They’re just sculptures,” She said.

  “All the same, I would appreciate it if they were disassembled. Okay? Please and thank you, honey pie!”

&#x200B;

Diana continued to smile at me although her smile seemed so much more hollow.

  “I’ll take it under advisement,” She said, which struck me as a polite way of saying: *‘no.’*

&#x200B;

Honestly, I’d expected this. I’d hoped that once I explained to Diana that her decorations were simply too scary for my children, she would understand and remove them in the interest of being a good neighbor. But, that’s the problem with dealing with a lot of people these days. Nobody wants to be a good neighbor anymore.

  “Well don’t take it under advisement, just do it!” I said, “I’m sure I’m not the first one to complain, and even if I am, you’re making my children uncomfortable!”

  “Really? Your oldest seemed pretty fascinated by them to me.”

  “He doesn’t know better, it’s making him uncomfortable.” I insisted. “I’m asking nicely, just take them down!”

&#x200B;

Now I could see her starting to get agitated. Her smile faltered.

  “Look, it’s my property so I’m free to put up what I’d like, okay?”

Oh, I’d heard *that* argument before.

  “That’s not how freedom works!” I said, “You need to work with the community here!”

  “No one else in the community has complained,” She said. “People seem to like them.”

&#x200B;

No one else in the community had complained? *I* was complaining!

  “I *am* the community!” I snapped.

She stared at me incredulously. 

  “No you’re not,” She said. 

  “I am! I am the community!”

  “Look… I understand if you find my decorations scary, but don’t you think this is a bit of an overreaction? I’ve seen your kids, your oldest son isn’t bothered by them and if your youngest son is afraid of them, you should let him get closer to them. Show him that they’re not alive. Once he sees that, he won’t be scared of them anymore!”

&#x200B;

  “Let my *children* get closer to your decorations?” I asked in disbelief. Was this woman stupid or was she insane? 

  “Absolutely not! Do you understand what Halloween is? It’s a direct conduit to Satan, if I let my children get close to those things they could get possessed by the Devil!”

&#x200B;

Diana blinked very slowly, her expression not changing one bit, but I could sense the condescending energy radiating off of her.

  “Right… okay…"

  "It's spiritual warfare!" I said, but by this point I already knew that I couldn't have a rational conversation with this woman.

  “Spiritual warfare?” She repeated, completely deadpan. 

  “Exactly! You do realize that Halloween is a Satanic holiday, don’t you?”

  “Satanic holiday?” Her tone remained completely deadpan.

&#x200B;

  “It’s a Satanic trick! Glorifying witches, the occult, demonic entities, vampires… it’s Satanic! A twisted guise to trick children into swearing their souls to Lucifer!”

  “Kids dressing in costumes are swearing their souls to Lucifer…?” Her deadpan tone grew lower. “Don’t you think that’s a bit of an overreaction?”

 “*That* is how the Devil appears!” I explained, “He comes in an innocent form but he’s *not* innocent! He’s not!”

&#x200B;

 “Uh huh.”

 “There’s no innocent participation in these things! If you can’t wake up and face the reality, then I’m sorry honey pie but you’re condemning yourself to Hell and you’re trying to drag the children down with you!”

  “Uh huh.”

&#x200B;

Now she was really starting to upset me. Here I was, *explaining* things to her in simple, reasonable terms and all she was doing was nodding at me like a bored teenager! 

  “No, not ‘*uh huh*’! Stop with the ‘*uh huh*!’ I’m explaining this to you! I’m telling you the truth!”

  “I mean… you certainly seem to believe there’s some merit to what you’re saying,” She said.

&#x200B;

  “It’s not what I believe, it’s what’s true! It doesn’t matter what I believe or what you believe, it’s the truth!”

  “Okay,” She said tonelessly, “I get it.”

  “Do you? Do you get it?”

  “I get it,” She said, “Thank you, you have a nice day now.”

&#x200B;

She tried to close the door on me, but I stopped her.

  “Don’t you close that door on me!” I warned, “You close the door on me and you’re closing the door on Jesus!”

  “Okay, well. Goodbye Jesus.”

&#x200B;

Then, to my horror she *assaulted me!* She attacked me with a violent savagery the likes of which I’d never experienced before! The way she threw me out of her doorway and down her porch, dashing me against the cold hard concrete of her walkway was inhumane! Never in my life had I been treated with such brutal disrespect and I suspect that the injuries I suffered from that attack may just remain with me for the rest of my life! Naturally, I called the police on her. I had expected them to do the sensible thing and have her arrested, but they said that *‘Miss Warwick had not put her hands on me.’*

&#x200B;

Outrageous of them to take her word over mine… but after they asked me to leave, there was nothing else I could do. I had failed at a diplomatic approach. 

&#x200B;

Something drastic needed to be done.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I don’t relish using underhanded means to get what I want. But regrettably, it is sometimes necessary. I told my husband Hugh in detail about how unspeakably rude Diana had been when I’d tried to speak with her and he agreed that something *needed* to be done. Despite his flaws, Hugh is a good husband. He is not the most dominant man, but he is good to me and good enough *for* me. When I make a request of him, he listens and is obedient, which suits me just fine.

&#x200B;

So when I told him that if Diana would not be taking her decorations down herself, that we would be taking them down for her, he agreed without much hesitation. It was not the first time we’d resorted to such drastic measures and likely would not be the last either. 

&#x200B;

We waited until nightfall, a few days after my discussion with Diana had gone south. I had hoped that she might negate the need to take direct action by deciding to be amicable and taking the decorations down as per my initial request, but it seemed she still aspired to be difficult.

&#x200B;

My children remained terrified of her decorations, of course. My eldest son would talk about them to his friends, telling them how ‘cool’ they were and even my youngest son was starting to take an interest in them… feeble attempts to mask their terror, no doubt and with Halloween in just a few days there was little time to delay. 

&#x200B;

We woke ourselves up at around 2 AM to get to work. Hugh brought an axe from our shed out back to assist in disassembling the sculptures. I expected him to do most of the heavy lifting, as it were. He had more muscle than I did. But I would keep myself busy collecting Diana’s other decorations to be disposed of while he dealt with the sculptures. 

&#x200B;

Diana’s property was only just down the street, and as we approached, I could see those grotesque sculptures of hers lurking amongst the autumn leaves, expressionless faces staring at nothing. The streetlights caused the branches to cast an even more ominous shadow over them and even I felt a twinge of fear as I looked at them. But as Diana had said… they were not alive. There was nothing to fear from these demonic idols themselves. The fear came from that which they represented.

&#x200B;

I had not gotten a close look at the sculptures up until then, but looking at them now, they really were quite hideous although the the ornate runes carved into their wooden bodies were rather impressive. They had a pattern to them, radiating out from their chests like veins carved into their bodies. 

&#x200B;

I noticed Hugh admiring one of those vile sculptures for a few moments before he picked up his axe to get to work. I sat back for a moment, watching him take the first swing. His axe bit into the wood with a satisfying *thwack.* The wood split and splintered, damaging the runes on the surface. He tore his axe free, before swinging again, biting into the wood deeper.

&#x200B;

I hadn’t expected the sculptures to be so sturdy… these seemed to be solid wood. Hugh seemed a little surprised as well, pausing for a moment before preparing for another swing. 

&#x200B;

I left him to his work before turning to collect her other decorations. The fake cobwebs went first along with the plastic spiders. I stuffed it all into a garbage bag I’d brought so I could throw it in a dumpster where it belonged.

&#x200B;

Once I was done with that, I set to work on her makeshift cemetery. The crosses and headstones she’d put there were made of cheap wood she’d salvaged from somewhere and admittedly did look rather impressive, but they still had to go. I pulled them up one by one, as Hugh hacked away at the first of the sculptures behind me.

&#x200B;

He was taking longer than I’d expected and when the sound of hacking stopped, I looked back at him, half expecting my husband to be taking a break. I was about to scold him for it… although Hugh wasn’t there to scold.

&#x200B;

His axe lay on the ground by one of the trees, but by husband was nowhere to be found… and neither was the sculpture he’d been cutting into.

&#x200B;

I stood silent for a moment, trying to process what I was looking at. I stared at the spot where the sculpture had been, then looked around. Had Hugh felled it? Maybe he’d dragged it off? Although it had looked quite heavy… could he have even been able to move it? Could he? 

&#x200B;

I walked over to the axe, looking around. Though I knew God protected me, I still couldn’t help but feel a small shiver down my spine. 

&#x200B;

God protected me… But… I didn’t feel Gods protection at that particular moment. Actually I… I felt quite vulnerable. 

&#x200B;

  “Hugh?”

I hoped he’d answer me. I hoped he’d come right out and say: *‘Here I am, dear!’* But… Hugh was nowhere to be found. I did not hear his voice. He did not come out of hiding. He just… wasn’t there.

&#x200B;

I heard a rustle in the trees above me from what I assumed was the wind as I looked around.

  “Hugh?” I called again.

From the corner of my eye, I noticed a light coming on in Diana’s house. Confound it, we’d woken her! No doubt she’d come out to investigate! My instincts told me to run or hide… but I couldn’t just abandon Hugh! He’d surely notice that Diana was coming out, right? My husband wasn’t that stupid!

&#x200B;

What to do… what to do…?

&#x200B;

I moved, running away from the light and out onto the street, just as I saw Diana’s front door open. I dove behind a parked car and watched from behind it as she stepped out onto her porch, eyes scanning her yard… and that was when I finally noticed it. When her eyes fixated on *it,* lurking in one of the trees in her yard… a tree mere feet from where Hugh had been working to chop down one of those abominations.

&#x200B;

It perched in the branches like some unholy four limbed spider, difficult if not impossible to notice at a glance. But when she came out, it began to move, creeping from the tree onto her roof.  In the light from her porch, I could see a shape hanging in amongst the branches… a mangled body.

&#x200B;

The moment I saw it, my heart stopped in my chest. I didn’t need to see the face to know who it was… my Hugh… my husband… my God given love… his life stolen from him by that… that *thing!*

&#x200B;

Oh Lord… what was it? 

&#x200B;

I saw Diana’s gaze following that infernal *thing* up onto her roof… her posture was tense although she seemed to know exactly what it was. She didn’t seem *afraid* she seemed ready to fight. I saw some sort of knife in her hand at the ready. The thing on the roof loomed over her, its body slowly moving into a position to strike but she didn’t seem afraid. 

&#x200B;

As she stood defiant before that wretched sculpture, I saw the other three in her yard begin to move. The one on her roof paused, staring at the others, almost curious. The others crawled toward it, reaching for it.

&#x200B;

I watched them lunge for it, grab it, restrain it. I watched as they held it down for Diana, fighting it to keep it from struggling. She carved something into its chest with her dagger, some sort of rune, although I couldn’t make it out from my hiding spot.

&#x200B;

The sculpture writhed, almost as if it was in pain, and then it went limp. Diana inspected its body. I saw her looking down at the spot where Hugh had almost cut through one of its limbs with disgust before she took her knife and began to carve her runes into the wood anew. 

&#x200B;

I sat in my hiding spot, watching her work… although as the other sculptures began to move again, I felt an all too familiar fear rising up in my chest. One of their eyeless faces turned to look at me… I felt those hollow eyes stare into my mortal soul… and they broke me.

&#x200B;

I ran.

&#x200B;

It was the only thing I could think to do… run.

&#x200B;

I saw Diana’s head turning to look at me as I fled, but I never saw the look on her face. Perhaps that was for the best.

&#x200B;

I fled and I escaped.

&#x200B;

It was all I *could* do. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

I did not sleep a wink that night. I did not call the police either… what would I tell them? That wooden sculptures had come alive and murdered my husband? Sure, there was a body left behind… but not for long.

&#x200B;

Come morning… Diana’s yard looked the same as it had when the sun had set. The sculptures were all in the same place. There was no corpse in the trees. It was like nothing had happened at all. 

&#x200B;

What does one do in the face of tragedy? Is there a satisfactory answer to that question? 

&#x200B;

My children got ready for school without me, and after they left I sat quietly in my bedroom, staring out the window at Diana’s yard. It was only when I heard the knock at my door that I moved, and even then I felt a sinking dread in my guts when I heard that knock. Part of me wanted to ignore it… but I knew better.

&#x200B;

There were no cars out in my driveway… no obvious clues on who had come to visit, which left me with a good idea of who *had* come for me. With heavy feet I trudged downstairs, my gaze distant and faraway. With a trembling hand, I reached for the door before taking a deep breath and forcing myself to open it.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure what I expected… Diana, yes. But I didn’t know what to expect from her. Death, maybe? Was that too much? Although if I expected death, why did I open the door? I suppose it’s hard to be in your right mind so soon after witnessing such madness. Diana was indeed waiting out on my porch, her cool brown eyes locked with mine. An axe sat waiting in her hand, but she didn’t hold it in a threatening manner. Actually, she just handed it to me without a word.

&#x200B;

I took the axe, before looking down at it, not entirely sure what to make of what she’d just given me. I looked back at her, as if she might say something that would explain any of this. 

&#x200B;

I’m not sure if what she said to me *did* explain any of it…

  “You know… I had them under control,” She said softly. “They were *inert,* so long as the runes remained untouched. I really didn’t think anyone would be stupid enough to go at them with an axe… but here you are, I guess.”

&#x200B;

I didn’t have any answer to what she said. She just shook her head in frustration.

  “I won’t waste my time with the police… so I’d advise you don’t either. Whatever happens next, accept it and move on. Is that clear?”

&#x200B;

I just stared at her, unable to nod. She seemed to take that as agreement.

  “And from now on, *you stay the hell off my property.* Please and thank you, honey pie.”

&#x200B;

She spat those final words at me, before turning away and walking off my porch. I never said a single parting word to her.

&#x200B;

I had no words to say.

&#x200B;

My husband was found later that day on a hiking trail not far from our house.

&#x200B;

I had to make up a lie about what had happened to him… I told the police he’d gone on a late evening jog and explained away his absence by saying that I’d worried he was being unfaithful. It was a flimsy, ugly lie but it was better than risking the impossible truth. 

&#x200B;

I can’t think straight anymore. I’m not sure what to do next or where to go from here. I have no answers. No option for recourse. Nothing to pray for. Nothing at all. What I’ve seen seems to defy explanation or logic… it ventures into the realm of complete madness.

&#x200B;

Is it complete madness? Am I mad?

&#x200B;

I’m not sure.

&#x200B;

I’m not sure of anything, anymore.
