You know what's worse than a haunted mansion? A haunted apartment. At least, when you have more rooms, you can just move into another to get away. In my one-bedroom apartment, if you're uncomfortable, you stay there. I've started spending the nights in my bathroom - I can't sleep over too often at my friends' house, and hotels are out of the question.

It doesn't even make any effort to hide from me. I see it in every reflection, a drop of white mixed with red and green, the same tribal mask from my previous update. I can ignore it, look the other way or just close my eyes, but the whistling is what drives me insane.

Playful, eerie melodies fill my apartment. The whistles travel back and forth through my hallway - one from the end of it, a question, and another from right behind me, an answer.

Could there be more? More... entities? 

It's 9PM and October. Naturally, it's dark outside. I've got all the lights on and I'm keeping them that way. Music is in the background, some blues to ease the tension. I can't talk to anyone about this - they'll think I'm insane. 

I tried multiple times to lock the front door, but to no avail. I ended up blocking it with a chair, but I don't think it'll really help. 

Sitting on my couch, on FaceTime with my sister. Apple cider in my hand. The smell of lavender lingering around, from a candle I'd forgotten to put out the night before. My bare feet sinking into the wool carpet. 

'Hey, do you think you can turn down the music a little? I can't hear you,' she says.

With a sigh, I press pause on my computer. 'I'm sorry, it's just... I don't like the silence.'

'Look, I told you you might not have been ready to live alone. It can get really lonely sometimes. You should come visit. Or I'll come-'

'*No.* I'll come to you.'

She frowns. 'All right, I guess you're not so eager to have me over. Why not? I won't care if your home's a mess.'

'It's not that. I just... don't really feel safe in this neighborhood. I don't want you here.'

She frowns. 'Liam, if you don't feel okay, move out. I don't want to see you on the news.'

I smile. 

'Hey, since when have you become so eccentric?' She laughs.

'What?'

'Your home decorations are... interesting.'

'What do you mean?'

She gestures behind me. 'The mask on your wall.'

I turn around. A red and green tribal mask is hanging from my wall, it's eyes wide and bloodshot, with wool locks of hair framing a grotesque, red stained smile. The eyes are so vividly painted, I suddenly feel the intimacy of eye contact and it becomes burning and unbearable, so I turn away. 'Yeah, I don't know what came over me,' I mutter. Look, I need to go to sleep.'

'It's 9PM.' 

'Yeah, I'm just not feeling very well.'

My hands are trembling as I hang up. I take a sharp breath as I turn around, and the mask is still there. 

Only, this time, where the eyes should have been, it's just two cutouts. I can see the white wall through them. 

That can only mean one thing - it took the mask off, and I'm not sure I want to see its real face.

My phone keeps buzzing with these alerts. I didn't exactly lie when I said my neighborhood wasn't entirely safe, but my door doesn't lock now, so I can't really do anything about it. 

I have some Amy Winehouse playing in the background, set on a sleep timer, and the pills are starting to kick in. In a few minutes, I'll drift off to sleep. A faint car alarm pierces the distance - or is it someone whistling? I wouldn't know. The apartment sinks in the darkness, and the only one that keeps the shadows off me is a moon night light.

In one minute, I'm sleeping. In the next, I'm wide awake and standing up, because someone has just twisted my doorknob. 

With a click, my front door opens creaking. Could it be the thing? No, for two reasons. One, the footsteps sound human. Two, it's already in the house. 

My eyes scan the hallway. Whoever came in is not using a flashlight. There's just different levels of darkness - the black rectangle in the far left is my opened front door, and the silhouette going towards the kitchen is, well, some guy. 

I knew there were burglars around, but why pick the only house that has no locks? My luck couldn't have been worse.

As the intruder moves away, I'm only thinking how to get the fuck out. I don't even know what to take with me - I wouldn't have time, anyway. He might have a gun. My eyes are desperately darting from the opened door to the kitchen. 

Before I can make any decisions, a long, playful whistle is heard from the other end of the hallway.

Both me and the intruder freeze. The whistle echoes again back to us, a bit off-key.

Without thinking, I whistle back.

Suddenly, a cold, dry hand covers my mouth, pressing so hard my neck tenses up. My eyes widen in fear, but I can't move. I sink into the floor, and I don't remember anything after that.

When I wake up, the morning light is creeping through the blinds. I'm in my hallway, on the floor, and my front door is wide open. *For fuck's sake.* I get up and shut it, then search around the house. The burglar had left, and taken nothing. I guess the whistling had creeped him out, too. 

Over the next days, I try to live normally. I won't lie to you, sometimes it feels like I'm walking through water. My brain is foggy, and the whistling now covers any song I play. I find myself yelling like a lunatic, and sometimes whistling back. The tribal mask still hangs in my living room, and I'm afraid to see that thing without it. 

Oh, and my apartment has this weird fucking smell. I just can't get rid of it, no matter what I do.

Anyway, I've kind of isolated myself from everyone. I just feel like I have to hide something from them, a disgusting secret that stains my skin. Even the outside world seems to make my experience weirder - there's now missing person's flyers at the entrance of the building, and I can't help but envy the victim, because at least they don't have to live where I live.

Until now, the only types of notes I got were *Please whistle back.* The same note, over and over again, found in different parts of my home. If I can call it a home, after all that's happened.

Two minutes ago, I got another note. This time, it read:

*You owe blood.*

My tired mind couldn't process it at first. Then, the events of that night with the intruder, the smell in my house and the missing flyer suddenly clicked in together. 

I'm startled, and my eyes remain fixed on the mask on my wall. A whistle echoes behind me.

A few seconds pass. Then, I see something black in the corner of my eye. A hand reaches over my shoulder and drops another note.

*Look in your closet.*

I already know what's in there.
