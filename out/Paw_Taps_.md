My family has a farm in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, and every creature that’s lived and died there is buried on the property. They were most recently joined by Potato, the cat I raised from a kitten who decided he was needed elsewhere after 15 years, so the earth is still settling on his plot. 

The animals were allowed to come and go and would tap the glass of the door facing the east to be let in or out. There was always someone there to open the door for them. I know the sound of the tap of paws on the door very well.

The only one who still paw taps the door is my parents elderly rottweiler, Bruno. The chickens try to imitate it, but you can hear the difference between a mammal paw and a chicken beak. At least after 20+ years at that house you can.

I visited over Thanksgiving a few weeks ago. It was a new moon so the star gazing was prime. I spent a couple evenings in the frozen grass outside looking up into the Milky Way. Where I laid was about halfway up the hill where the graveyard is. Every creature buried there was loved by me and I think did love me back. Except possibly some of the chickens. They tried, though.

The first night I went out I felt something touch my hand as I was lying down. It felt warm, which nothing should have outside in 8 degrees. I made my way indoors not long after that encounter.

I settled into the couch with my book and glass of wine left over from dinner. It had been out for hours, I’m not always the classiest. I heard the softest paw tap on the door and stood to open it, purely out of habit. Then I noticed Bruno sleeping by the woodstove. 

The deck that door opens to is old and creaky, as is the house, especially when the wind is blowing. I think the thermodynamics of the place cause even more “settling” noises than most. That is to say, I figured it was a house noise and didn’t think much of it. 

The second day went by without issue. 

That night I bundled up and went back out for stargazing. I took a bowl to smoke with me, figuring I’d stay longer than the previous night. When you’re in a place with little to no light pollution, the longer you’re out the more stars you can see. I live in a city so I wanted to really soak it up. 

After about 20 minutes, a soft voice called my name. It sounded like it was coming from the top of the graveyard hill. I looked back in the direction of the house to see if there was anyone calling me for the porch (or awake and walking around). I saw no movement, there’s always a soft glow from the woodstove and holiday decorations so it’s easy to see anyone who’s walking around the house. 

Then it hit me, from the outside anyone or anything could see our whereabouts. Not close enough to see what we were doing, but whatever was calling me had seen me arrive and had been watching me since. 

All sound ceased suddenly. The voice became clearer, “come on up, I’ve missed you so much.”

I grabbed my flashlight and clicked it on, pointing it upwards to see what was there. There was a single deer, a female, staring at me with the most humanlike green eyes I’d ever seen. I know with deer once you see one, there will be others, but I saw no others. 

She was standing by the grave of Pluto, Potato’s brother. He’d always been loved by deer. He would come home all slicked down from the deer licking him. 

I saw the brush start to quiver behind the doe and something told me to RUN. I could only move so quickly, but as I made my way back to the house I heard something behind me. I glanced back and it was a fluffy brown chicken. I knew my family had gotten some new hens earlier in the year, so I was flooded with relief watching her waddle after me. 

That night was less restful. I’d gotten a few ticks on me laying on the ground so I was checking my whole body in the bathroom. There’s a small window in the bathroom about two meters up. 

I heard a paw tap against the bathroom window. There was no way an animal could reach that window to tap it unless it was over seven feet tall. 

My parents were asleep by this point, so I snuck around downstairs and closed the blinds in every window, careful to not look out of them.

I woke up the next day without incident. After breakfast I stepped onto the deck and noticed splatters of what looked like blood at first - I let my family know so we departed to the chicken house to make sure everyone was accounted for. When I asked my mom the whereabouts of the little brown one, she didn’t know what I was talking about.

All the chicks they got this year grew into completely black or golden/green adults. My mom had brown hens before, and a few of her favorites who died of old age are buried on the hill. All the chickens were fine, so we checked Bruno. He occasionally got little wounds from shaking his ears too hard or into a rough surface but I didn’t find any fresh wounds. My mom insisted it was an injury on Bruno we couldn’t find, but I checked him over and found nothing.

A few hours later I went out for a smoke and the splatter was still wet. I grabbed a dry leaf and dipped it into one of the splats so I could get a better look. It wasn’t human blood, which dries quickly and into a reddish shade. This was the blackish reddish purple of elderberry and was still wet after hours. There are no berry bushes or trees in season that it could have come from. It looks like blood, just not human blood. 

I’m recording this for pattern recognition and insight. I’m going back for the Christmas break which is longer so I’ll have more time to investigate. I want to know what I’m dealing with so I can do what I can to protect my family - or if I need to. Whatever is out there has been living in harmony with the farmers and the mountains for longer than I can conceptualize. The farm is fortunately within an hour and a half’s drive of two universities. I’m going to find a folklorist and see what they can tell me. 

I’ll let you all know what I find out.
