 You ask anybody where the scariest place to work is you'll more than likely get hospitals, graveyards, or historical buildings where human suffering occurred. These places have documented legends or true facts. My story has no explanation. It just is.

 My name's Dave. I was unemployed and Ed got me a job in a food warehouse. He used to work there and had a good rapport with the management. I was thankful at first. Now Ed and I don't talk because I quit without notice. Screw you Ed. I can't even be sure if you had knowledge about the candy room.

 Now let me explain the candy room where I worked. It was in the middle of the warehouse. There were two automatic steel doors on both sides because the candy had to be kept at a certain temperature. The shelves had a rusty conveyor so you could slide the chocolate down the rails.

 We sold in bulk. Mostly to retail wholesalers and restaurants in the city/suburbs. This is important because we sold huge cocoa bags and blocks of chocolate.

 I made the mistake of proving I was a hard worker. The 2nd shift boss noticed me. Who made sure the foreman noticed me. 

 The foreman tells me "You're quick and keep yourself busy. Why don't you come on the 3rd shift? I'll give you an extra dollar and you can work in the candy room."

 The first thing I noticed on 3rd shift is the quiet. It wasn't a big crew. Somewhere between 9 to 12 people worked with me. Occasionally someone would stop by to ask me to get an order for them. Or the boss would call me from the office from the front of the building.

 Most of the time I was alone. I was my own boss. All I had to do to was make sure those orders got out with the rest of the shipment. 

 Then I received a new co-worker. I doubt it put in an application. I don't know why I started to receive visits. Did my apparition hate how I did my job or was it mad I had stolen a few candy bars? I have no answers.

 There were 4 aisles in the candy room. A numbered system guided you down the aisles to the very back. Going down the last aisle I felt like something was watching me. Made no sense why I'd be afraid of one tiny part of the room.

 Next the conveyors in the candy room moved on their own. I'd hear the spinning of wheels like a child was playing on them. Heavy boxes would roll down by themselves while I was on the other side of the room.

 My boss was mad. I was starting to leave the candy room doors open. I got the typical "you must be out of your mind response" when I mentioned there might be a ghost. My unwanted friend never played games when the doors were open. Until it got mad I wouldn't listen to my boss. 

 One day I was working with the door closed after being warned the next violation would be a write up. I was in the middle of the candy room. I heard the steel door go up. Thinking it was a co-worker needing an order I went to the door.

 I heard a sharp staccato voice whisper "sweets sweets sweets" in my ear. 

 I blockaded myself in the bathroom stall for the rest of the night. Told my boss I wasn't feeling well.

 "Then take a couple of your sick days," as he looked at me frustrated. "You face is pale."

 I took all my sick days. It's bad enough working 3rd shift. You enter and leave work at night. It's impossible to sleep because the living world is up and going. When my body caved in from lack of sleep, I could add in nightmares during the daylight hours.

 That voice in my ear singing "Sweets sweets sweets."

 I came back a mess. Co-workers avoided me as I appeared near death. The foreman asked if he needed to give me a drug test. I just wanted to be given another job besides the candy room. 

 Next came the phone. It would ring. I would pick it up and there'd be nobody on the line. I was already on thin ice with the boss and sure wasn't going to ask if he was prank calling me.

 Then the call came I was dreading. I finally had a voice. The same staccato voice that said, "Hi Dave. Sweets sweets sweets." The phantom called me by name!!!

 Now the doors stayed opened and the phone was off the hook. I packed 2/3 of my orders because I wasn't going to work in that last aisle. I was tired of being stared at by a ghostly peeper. My boss sent me home with once last chance for tomorrow.

 My last night I went to the candy room like I was marching to death row. I was told to keep the doors closed and the phone on the hook.

 All went well. I thought the phantom was tired of messing with me. I came back from the second break with only 2 hours left of my shift. I was feeling pretty good.

 I nonchalantly hit the switch and the candy room door opened. Then the lights went out. I heard all the conveyors rolling like a Las Vegas casino. An orange ball is starting to grow into the size of a boulder by the last aisle.

 "SWEETS SWEETS SWEETS", a voice bellowed.

 I took off running in the darkness never looking behind me. I was sprinting like a rocket had been lit in my rear. I made it to the front door and jumped out as the phantom faded away. My boss called later that day to say he was taking my early absence as an indication I quit.

 I guess I'll never find who or what I shared my nights with in the candy room.. I hope the next employee doesn't experience worse.

 I'm seeking a job now. No answers on applications except I got a call from Hershey. I never applied there. Someone tell my candy room co-worker I'll find my own employment.
