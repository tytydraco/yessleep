Golden grease spilled from the corners of Adam's mouth as he chewed, glistening in the light of the campfire. His eyes were closed, and his head slowly lulled backwards as though he was savoring the grim harvest.

​



"Oh my god, dude, you gotta, oh god man, Jesus Christ, that stuff is-" Finally swallowing, Adam struggled to form a real sentence, pushing the bag into my hands and then trying to claw it back with the fervor of a wild beast. "Dude, Jay, you gotta try this stuff. Even if it ain't got any special powers, it is the best thing I ever tasted."

​



Despite his insistence on taking control of the bags, I pulled them out of his reach. I wanted to try, but not until I knew what it would do to us. "How do you feel?"

​



"Fine, I guess." He shrugged, looking down at his hands and then to his feet before idly scratching the back of his head. "I dunno, I don't think I really feel all that different."

​



The hand scratching at the back of his head didn't move, only intensified in its efforts. Adam muttered something about an itch and began to scratch with both hands. As clumps of blood-stained hair began to fall, I quickly got behind him to look at what was happening. His fingers were freshly slick with blood as his stubby fingernails dug into the warm flesh at the back of his head. Was he scratching to reveal something, or was he going to burrow through his skull?

​



Then, a glinting flash of familiar yellow broke through the dark space. It was an eye; hidden beneath strands of hair and sinew, coated in viscera. I grabbed a bottle of water and helped to wash off this new phenomenon, causing the eye to frantically twitch.

​



"I can see you behind me! I can't quite explain how it feels, but I can see ya as clear as if you were standing in front of me!" He was excited and very nearly shouting at me. I gestured for him to keep his voice down, looking to the sleeping bodies with a greed driven fear.

​



"Let's eat some more." I reached into the flesh bag and hungrily drove a fistful of gooey mush into my mouth. The texture was awful, snotty and coarse, with round pustules of sticky goop. A warm brine flavor, like seawater, was the first thing I could taste. Before the flavor could settle and sour in my mouth, a rush of coconut and chocolate sweetness overtook the salt and balanced the mixture. Then, when I thought that the flavor profile couldn't get any better, the popping pus bubbles added pockets of creamy caramel.

​



It was the best thing I had ever eaten, and I could understand Adam's nearly orgasmic response. I felt nothing for the first few minutes; the corpse simply allowed me to enjoy the taste of its succulent flesh. My chest began to feel tight, and I felt short of breath, as though I couldn't fully catch my breath. Like an inflating balloon, I kept sucking air in, unable to exhale until my lungs were full, but that moment felt like it would never come. The pressure built, continuing to swell until I could feel my lungs pressing against my chest. Sharply, my ribs slowly snapped, bringing with them an electric jolt of stabbing pain. I wasn't given enough of a chance between breaks to fully recover, being dragged to my knees by the thirst for air and constant pain.

​



Finally, forehead pressed against the sand, I was able to truly draw in a breath. It was a deep breath, and the bones in my chest ground against one another as my lungs ballooned outwards. Seams had split down the center of my chest, which burned as they spread to make way for the deep breath.

​



My next bite, Brain this time, was blinding. The skin above my eyes began to soften and droop before fully melting across my eyes. I tried to claw at them to no avail, unable to rip open the freshly sealed skin. I wanted to trust the magic of the pool and the flesh, but I knew there was a distinct non-zero chance that I could be permanently disabled by my hubris. Eventually, with the feeling of a zipper catching and then tearing over skin, I was able to pry the new horizontal film of my third eyelids.

​



Across from me, Adam's ribcage pierced through the front of his chest in a hail of thorns, splattering blood across the beach. He put his hand in his mouth and bit down to prevent himself from screaming, both of us unwilling to share the delicacy with anyone else. The bony protrusions continued to grow forward before painfully bending back and sewing themselves through his form. Crossing over each other and dipping in and out of the skin, the thin rib bones eventually weaved into a piece of pseudo armor over his torso.

​



Accompanied only by the sound of our own gnashing teeth and the sloppy squishing of the ichor pit's meat, we feasted until dawn began to break. My fingers fused and then spread, connected by a thin membrane of fresh pink skin. Adam's legs lengthened through the thigh, and the sinewy muscle swelled until it was as dense as stone. My ears fell off, leaving only small holes covered by flaps of skin. Adam's nose flattened, removing a weakness. My hair fell out, and fatty tissue began to bloat around my midsection and legs. Adam's brow bone thickened, and his teeth fell out, replaced by sharper canines.

​



Orange and pink tones fought away the dark blues of night as the sun began to ascend over the trees. The light illuminated the empty bags, signifying the end of our gorging. Around us, the forest seemed to shiver and withdraw, the scrutinizing gaze disappearing with the shadows. However, we traded one observer for a new group of watchers.



​

Sprinting footfalls skid to a stop in the sand, replaced by a shriek of panic and fear. Jasmine was the first to reach us, and she screamed a shrill cry at the monstrous form Adam had taken. In the morning light, he looked like a beast bred for war and carnage, heavy brow forcing a constant scowl and sharp teeth poking through the soft tissue of his lips. Hector and Cindy arrived next, and the minute that they laid eyes upon me, Hector projectile vomited. I couldn't help but feel like that was an overreaction.

​



The sleeping few on the beach were awake and shouting by the time Chris finally joined us. It was a cacophony of sound. "What the fuck is wrong with you!?" Came one voice, although I couldn't tell who. "-selfish fucking pricks! You're going to do this without-" Another voice, only temporarily cutting through the chaos. "Look at you now! You're MONSTERS!" Finally, a voice I recognized, Jasmine. Her shout was followed by a swift slap to my face, and then a retching 'ew' as her hand came away coated in slime.

​



"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" Adam screamed, his voice more like a raging bear than like that of a man. The beach fell silent in response.

​



"It's alright. We feel fine, no, better than fine, we feel great. If you don't want to eat, no one is going to force you, and if you do, there's plenty more in the pit." My voice now perpetually sounded as though I had a bubble in the back of my throat. Despite sounding like a frog, my words assured the jealous and temporarily seemed to settle the disturbed.

​



The soft, warm glow of sunlight caressed the back of Adam's head, which caused him to howl in agony. Suddenly, he clutched the back of his head and threw himself to the floor, hiding in the shadows. Instinctively, I fell to my knees as well, dodging the inbound sunlight. Joy got to him first, her face going pale as she stared at the back of his head.

​



Where his new eye had been rested a scorched and smoking hole, dripping with the melted ocular orb. The flaming scar stretched up the back of his head and down the nape of his neck, radiating away from the new wound. His forehead split open, and his chest began to crack and bleed profusely.

​



I would have assumed that these sufferings were only because he had stood in the sunlight, if only I hadn't started to experience similar things. The soft, blubbery fat I had grown began to dry and harden into leather beneath my skin, slowly petrifying me. Between my fingers, the skin began to redden and crack, threatening to fully tear open. We were drying out.

​



"The water!" I hoarsely called to the others before slowly floundering over to the wall and throwing myself into it. They got the idea and moved Adam, although his new form made it so that they needed to combine all of their strength to merely shove him through the sand.

​



Instantly, upon touching the water, the drying flesh was rejuvenated and healed. The pain subsided and left me with the clarity of mind to really digest what had just happened. Adam and I were fine on land until the sun rose and shone upon us. We had forsaken our right to walk in the light and thrown away our humanity. All for what? Stronger skin or the ability to hold our breath for longer?

​



I floated in the water in lamentation, watching as Adam slowly came to again, unsure of everything that had led to this point. Slowly, my gaze drifted across the surface of the water towards the Malligator's nest. It had been the thing that led me here, and to make these choices, I was hoping that I would see it and have some sort of revelation. I would not be so fortunate. Maybe it was only a dream after all.

​



Our morning was plagued by fear and uncertainty, driven by the lack of knowledge on how these new bodies reacted to sunlight. As light was slowly cast over the pool, we tested the effects it would have on us. I, bravely, went first, pushing my hand into a beam of light, under the water. Luckily, there was no pain. Bringing my hand into the sun above the water caused it to almost instantly start sizzling painfully.

​



I was far luckier in this situation, given that I could now hold my breath for quite some time. Adam, on the other hand, was struggling to even swim and would be relegated to hiding beneath a cove of trees until the sun faded.

​



"What was it like?" Joy sat on the edge of the wall, feet dangling above the water, near the cove that Adam and I hid in.



​

"It tasted so good, like the finest barbecue I ever ate." Adam looked to me before explaining the taste to her. That wasn't how it tasted, at least not to me, and I shortly explained as much.

​



"It probably tastes different for everyone then. You don't have any more handy... do you?" There was an edge of trepidation in her voice, but the possibilities kept her talking.

​



"We didn't tell you how it felt. It was excruciating. The worst pain I have ever felt every after every single bite." Like some sort of cosmic consequence or warning to stop before I went any further. I didn't say that last part out loud.

​



"Pfft, it wasn't even that bad. Felt like I was being licked by kittens." Adam waved my words away and played the tough guy. I couldn't imagine how he didn't feel like he was going to die as he was going through some of his transformations.

​



"Will you get me some?" Joy almost sounded ashamed to ask, her eyes looked down one of the nature trails rather than at us. My brow furrowed. On one hand, it didn't seem right to subject someone to the new torment that we faced. However, on the other hand, it didn't feel right to deny someone the enlightenment that eating the meat granted.

​



"I need a hammer, my knife, and another plastic bag."

​



This time, I would be able to dive down into the Ichor pit unhindered by diving equipment. I sucked in a deep breath, closed the third eyelid, and plunged into the depths. Peering through the membrane rather than through the glass of my goggles required an adjustment, as the quality of my sight was slightly blurrier. Still, though, I was descending to the bottom of the ravine without any extra gear, and that feeling was freeing. I had always felt at home in the water; it's what led me to be a dive instructor in the first place. Now, I didn't just feel at home in the water; I felt like I held dominion over it.

​



Using my hammer, I broke away the sharp bone fragments that had sliced me open on my last foray into the skull. Once it was sufficiently open, I carefully lowered into the space and set about collecting the tender matter. Before, this had been a desperate race and a struggle to collect enough, then escape. Now, I had been underwater for minutes and felt no pressure to leave. Glancing up through the shattered wound, I spotted the rows of yellow eyes staring back from within the cattails. Unlike my first encounter with the beast, I didn't feel afraid or at odds with the creature. Now I felt reassured by its presence, as though the eyes were urging me to go on and eat my fill.

​



Once I left, two bags brimming with brain matter, the malligator descended. I had split apart the head of whatever lay dead beneath the sand, which meant that it could stuff its snout in again and consume more. Arriving on the surface, I had plenty of breath to spare, and the nurse on the beach told me that I had been beneath the water for twenty-seven minutes.

​



She ate her fill, despite the mild protest of other rangers on the beach. She claimed that the meat tasted like lemon cheesecake with fresh blueberries.  Unsurprisingly, her metamorphosis was an extremely painful process, in which she nearly drowned herself trying to fight the agony. She was left with larger eyes, needle-like fingers, three wrist joints per arm, and protruding hypodermic veins. Eating the flesh was having a separate effect on each of us, although we couldn't determine the criterion for the changes.

​



The sun fully set and everyone wanted to go home, sleep on the events of the day. For safety, due to the drying effect of daytime air, the three of us took home a few five gallon buckets. If we overslept or couldn't get back here for some reason, then hopefully we could fill our bathtubs with the water and make it through the day.

​



Sleep found me almost instantly, and I was thrust into another dream. Another dream with another voice, this one different. This voice was angry.

​



# Not yours to take.

​



While I could still feel the emotions and see the images that this voice was trying to tell me, I could faintly hear the words it wanted to say. They were muted and dull, but they were there, spoken with an ancient voice like dust on the wind. Before me, I could see the pool, which glowed brightly, the blood churning into small waves.

​



# Ancient power, not meant for the hands of humankind.

​



This time, my vision was dragged to that of the forest, and I felt the familiar gaze of the presence in the shadows.

​



# Desecrating the guardian of the waters will have dire consequences.

​



The harsh light of the sun suddenly bore down upon me, my body brought to kneel and then forced lower as it began to burn. This time, though, I tried to speak back and found that I could. "It was already dead, its body was already going to waste."

​



# It would have been reborn. Consciousness creates. You have consumed its mind. It can never again come to be.

​



The sunlight faded as though my push back against the presence held sway over this realm. If it was happening in my mind, then maybe I actually did. Materializing my will and exerting it over the control of this place, I hunted for this presence. My vision began to shift, drawing through the trees and off the paths I knew. It snapped through the brush and pulled towards the mouth of a cave, hidden away behind a thicket of gnarled trees.

​



Suddenly, I was rejected and forced back into consciousness. It was still dark outside, but the sun would be rising soon. Unless I wished to be trapped in the tiny tub of my bathroom, I needed to get back to the park.

​



Joy, Mike, and I found ourselves in the water before the sun began to warm the skies. Adam was nowhere to be found, and the blood in my veins slowly began to turn to ice. Each passing minute was a minute closer to peril for our friend. Deep blue became purple, which faded into an orange hue being chased across the sky by pale blue.

​



We whispered to each other in a hush, hoping that Adam had simply decided to stay in his bathtub today. The sight of his police cruiser crashing through the brush and careening down the hill told us we were wrong. Smoke bloomed in an exhale of death from the inside of the cab as the vehicle turned end over end and flipped down the hill. The car pinballed off a few sturdy trees before cascading over the wall and splashing into the shallow waters.

​



I rushed across the water, swimming beneath the surface to avoid the dawning sunlight. Adam was dead when I reached him; he had probably been dead before his car broke through the wooden rails at the top of the hill. Inside the car was a mangled husk of the man we once knew, withered into a dry, cracked leather. Fruitlessly, I dragged him into the water, praying that its healing boons would resurrect him. There was no effect.

​



I pulled the anchor of bone back to the others on the shady cove. Joy looked away in horror, and Mike allowed a single tear to fall down his face. Once the sun had set, we could drag Adam onto the beach and then bury him. None of the other Rangers were here yet. As soon as they arrived, we would ask them to dig a grave for him.

​



"***Consume the divine flesh. It mustn't go to waste.***" Emerging from the sanctum of reeds, the malligator pierced our minds with its voice. Its voice pierced like a railroad spike being driven through our temples, a pain we all felt simultaneously. The blender in our skulls dredged up nausea and caused us to double over from the agony.

​



"You speak English?" I finally grunted through the pain, forcing my head up to meet the many-eyed gaze of our kindred spirit. It was a stupid question to ask; I knew that this beast in the water couldn't speak English. It was a response that came from shock at hearing the words with such alarming clarity. I ignored the blundered statement and addressed the malligator's point. "We can't eat him, he is our friend."

​



"***Was.***" The single word was cold and punchy, reminding us all of the reality that Adam Parker was nothing but a name now.

​



"It doesn't matter. I can't do it."

​



"***Then give it to me. We all have eaten of the flesh and become something greater, together.***" I could feel the emotions of the beast, and the emotions of Joy and Mike beside me. It was a cesspool of fear and hope and excitement and desire, and I couldn't tell which of those emotions belonged to me. "***But we are not done ascending. We must consume the entire thing. It would be a waste to let his body rot.***"



​

"Are you also stuck in the water?" I wasn't willing to hand off the body yet; I had more questions first. "If we finish eating the guardian, will we be able to leave the water again?"

​



"***No. This is the curse we accepted by eating this spirit.***" The beast huffed and grumbled with a voracious gurgle.

​



With a solemn sigh, we accepted. The malligator opened its gaping maw and presented a casket of tongue and teeth to lay the Sheriff to rest upon. Through the combined effort of Mike and Myself, we lifted Adam and placed him in the center of the coffin. The reptilian undertaker snapped shut the resting place and sealed it with jagged teeth. The sickening crunch of study bone should have been accompanied by a squelching of blood, but nothing came. The malligator simply crunched and ground the corpse of Adam into a paste, then swallowed.

​



"What if..." I didn't need to finish the thought. Just playing the experience of my dream from the night before was enough for the other members of the connected consciousness.

​



"***YES! THAT COULD WORK!***”  The thought rippled through our heads, and a similar Cheshire grin split across our faces. We had a plan to reclaim our right to walk upon solid ground.

​



Last month, we found a monster at the bottom of our lake. Yesterday, we ate that monster. Last night, I heard a voice from the woods. Tonight, we'll eat that monster too.
