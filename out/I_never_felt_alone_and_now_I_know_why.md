Growing up in a 4-bedroom country house, I always believed it to be haunted. My siblings, being older, always tried to scare me with stories of Mrs. Maisel, who had died in the house and liked to abduct little misbehaving girls. As a young child, I believed every word and tried to be the best-behaving little girl in the house, so she would take my sister instead.

But as I got older, strange things began to happen in the house that my parents couldn't explain. Taps in the bathroom would turn on at night, the baby gate for our Yorkies would be opened at the top of the stairs, and I would be blamed for it all, as I was a sleepwalker. Everything seemed innocent enough until my sister, at the age of 10, claimed she was pushed down the stairs one night while going to the bathroom.

As a result, we moved into an apartment in the city, and the paranormal activity quieted down. But as I grew older and moved out, strange things began to happen again, and I was accused of doing things I knew couldn't be true. My mother would accuse me of leaving taps open and the fridge door open, but I had no memory of doing so.

As I began studying psychology, I found myself struggling to keep up with my classes and my relationships. I broke up with my first serious boyfriend, and I started going out more with friends, spending less time with my mother. It was during this time that she accused me of trying to kill her in her sleep. I knew I was innocent, but I felt gaslit and alone.

I found a new apartment close to campus, but it was in poor condition and I had to spend a small fortune to make it livable. As I neared the end of my 4th year, I knew I had to repeat some subjects and find a second part-time job to cover the difference of my scholarship. I started bartending at night and being home at 3 am.

But even in my new apartment, strange things began to happen. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my bedroom door open and the smell of gas in the air. I knew I wasn't sleepwalking, but I couldn't explain it. I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was being watched, and I knew I had to uncover the truth about my past and my family's haunted house before it was too late.

As I begin to investigate the past events, I start to uncover dark secrets and conspiracies that threaten to destroy my family and the people I love. I must race against time to solve the mystery of the haunted house and the spirit of Mrs. Maisel before she can harm anyone else. But with every step closer to the truth, the danger grows more severe and I wonder if I will be able to survive the horrors that await me.

As I delved deeper into my investigation, I started to notice strange occurrences happening around me. I would see shadows moving on the wall when there was no one there, and I would hear whispers in my ear when I was alone. I began to suspect that the spirit of Mrs. Maisel was not the only entity haunting me, and that something else was at play.

I consulted with a psychic, who told me that I was being possessed by a malevolent entity that had attached itself to my shadow. She explained that this entity had been following me since I was a child and had been feeding off my fear and anxiety. It had been manipulating me through my sleepwalking and causing the strange occurrences in my life.

I was shocked and terrified by this revelation, but I knew I had to face my fear and confront the entity. I gathered all of my courage and performed a ritual to banish the entity from my shadow. The ritual was intense and draining, but it seemed successful. The entity was gone, and I felt a weight lifted off of my shoulders.

But as time passed, I started to notice that the strange occurrences were happening again. I would wake up in the middle of the night to find my bedroom door open and the smell of gas in the air. I knew that the ritual hadn't worked and the entity was still with me.

I felt a mix of disappointment and desperation as I realized that the ritual was only a temporary solution. The entity was still there, hiding in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike. I knew that I had to find a way to truly banish the entity and end its hold over me once and for all.

With a new sense of determination, I began to research different methods to get rid of the entity. I consulted with experts in the field of paranormal activity, and I poured over ancient texts to find a way to truly banish the entity from my shadow. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but I was determined to rid myself of the entity once and for all.
