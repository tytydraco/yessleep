It must’ve been sometime in October. 

I reached for my pill bottle to get an idea on the date, but the numbers and letters all swirled around me. I popped two pills suddenly remembering I haven’t taken the daily dose. My head didn’t clear, it only got worse. 

“Fuck.” I said, or maybe I only thought it. The line wasn’t clear. I must have already taken my dose. What time was it? What DAY was it? “Must be sometime in October” I said in my head, but a voice echoed in back.  I slumped down in my chair as Blue Alien from Outer Space! played on the television. I quickly fell asleep, dreams of shrill ringing and disembodied voices filled my head. 

A noise jittered me awake. Some movements outside in the yard. On the TV Gorp-Gorp had saved the little girl from the evil Red Aliens. I knew this part already. The movie played on my TV all day, everyday. Ever since I got sick that was. I must’ve got sick start of October I thought. The audio was distorted and mumbled, but my TV quality always worsens when I take too many pills. 

More commotion outside in the yard. I turned my head past the living room and outside the window and saw something. Something blue. It moved fast across the window before disappearing from my line of view. I shot up from the couch and ducked down into the hallway, stepping near my front door. “This couldn’t be” I thought. No, in fact I said it out loud. That’s when the knocking started. Banging ferociously on my door. I looked around for a weapon, something to fend myself I hoped. I ran to the hallway closest and grabbed a metal baseball bat, clutching it at my side before opening the door. 

There it stood. Four feet tall approximately. All blue with faint white spots. It had limbs like a human, but on its round, skinny head were two long antenas. Its eyes were black and soulless, its mouth just a slit, its nose two little holes. I gasped. It only mumbled. “Teeeekkkk… Teeeeeekkkkoooo…. Theeeeat. Teeeekoo-“ I cut it off with a long windup of the bat. It cracked heavily against the side of the aliens slender head before it fell helplessly to the ground. I shuddered hearing its bug like groans as liquid poured out from it. I stepped back into the door frame, it began to crawl up to me. I bashed it on the back and it squirmed again. 

I picked it up into the house, and it made no more movements. I had killed it. A wave of relief washed over me, but soon I worried what to do with an alien body. I couldn’t possibly donate it to science, could I? No. They’d lock me up for murder. For all I know, this alien has rights somewhere. I needed another pill or two. I treated myself to a necessary head reliever and passed out next to the dead blue alien. 

I woke up again hours later, or maybe it’s been weeks. I wondered now if it was still October. Must be November now, maybe even close to Thanksgiving. My head cold still throbbed, and I turned to see the blue alien lying still on my carpet. Staining it below. I felt a horrifying sense of guilt for killing this creature, but all of my remorse went away once I turned my attention to the TV. 

A news report. A young boy had gone missing. The details weren’t clear, the audio was distorted from the pills, but I could make the connections in my head after in absolute awe, it showed a blurry photo of what looked identical to the dead alien. It must have either killed or abducted the young boy. I was not an alien murderer, I was an accidental vigilante hero. I pondered my next options. 

I figured I could have just as easily turned it over to the police, but they would have questions and investigations. It would turn into my house becoming a hot spot for alien enthusiasts. I considered and eventually decided on telling the parents the whole story, and letting them go to the police. I searched the alien, finding in it, soft and stuck in a hole in its legs, a small phone with a cracked screen. On it was a smear of blood and a photo of a young boy in baseball gear. The alien had done something to this boy, and I was the only one who could do something to save him. 

I spent a day sobering up from the pills, but not too much of course. I wouldn’t be able to concentrate with such a blinding head cold. I found the parents of the missing boys number on the news article, and I called them. Telling them I may have some information for them. I heard a gasp on the phone. A woman’s voice could be heard hysterically in the background. A man told me thank you, please come over. So I did. I left the alien in my home, and I drove down the neighborhood.

The house was dim and silent. Photos of the poor boy was set up on a counter, a candle burning. The mother was sitting in the den with me, looking at me with a faint smile. I waited until the father entered with a cup of coffee for everyone. I declined. 

“What have you seen? Is he okay? Where is he?”’the mother broke her silence in an array of fast questions, looking tired and confused at me. The father rubbed her back. “Honey, honey please. Let him talk. What did you see friend.” he said reassuringly. 

I told them everything. I told them about the blue alien, and the bat, the cracked phone and the garbling. I told them how I’m not sure where their boy was, but I had killed the thing that took it. I watched their faces slip from hopeful curiosity to fear and dread. I wondered what I said wrong? The mother rushed to the kitchen in an instant. The father only stared at me. Crying could be heard from the kitchen. I noticed a Jack-O-Lantern sat rotting on the carpet. 

“Wha… what did it look like. What did it look like?” he asked me.

“What did what look like?” I asked back. 

The mother stepped back into the den, a knife in hand. She was on the phone with the police. Yelling and pointing it at me. The knife, not the phone. “HE DID IT!” she screamed “PLEASE. Please, please. Come quickly!” she yelled hysterically into the phone. 

The father searched around the house in a frenzy, before grabbing an empty Halloween costume bag. On it was a photo. He pointed at it.

“Was it this one. Did it look like this” he said murmuring, a wild look on his face. 

He was pointing at a photo of the blue alien on the bags poster board, a boys head stuck out from the costume and in its hands was the aliens head. 

I chuckled nervously a bit. “Oh wow…” I thought, but I accidentally said it out loud. “Oh wow…”

“Huh…. well I guess it WAS sometime in October.”
