I thought I escaped this. I was wrong.

I moved out of that apartment years ago. I thought I left it all behind—the missing objects, the creeping unease, the footsteps in the night. But lately, I’ve been feeling it again. That same sensation of being watched. The air growing thick when I’m alone.

And I don’t think I’m imagining it.

I grew up in a house that had once been a morgue—a house passed down through my family for generations. My mom and my brothers all saw spirits there. I was 17, when we finally left, and for the first time, I thought we were free.

We weren’t. Because over the course of five years. It has found me everywhere I go. 

This one particular apartment we moved to I was 19 going on 20. It was supposed to be— no it should have been a fresh start. Our fresh start. Instead, it became something worse. My mom and I both saw a dark figure in different parts of the apartment.

At first, it was small things. My rings would disappear and reappear in random places. Clothes went missing. The shower knobs turned on by themselves. But it wasn’t just that—they turned scorching hot, burning me and my husband (boyfriend at the time).

Never my mom.

The basement was the worst. It was where we did laundry, but it was also where you felt something breathing down your neck—even during the day. I hated going down there. I hated turning my back on the stairs, hated the way the air seemed to press in like something was standing right behind me.

My husband noticed it too. He heard the footsteps. Often.

For a while, I tried to ignore it. That only made it worse.

Nights in the kitchen were unbearable. The living room behind me was pitch-black, an abyss of silence so deep it made my ears ring. I couldn’t sit still. The second the house fell quiet, it felt like something was right behind me, breathing down my neck.

Then came the water.

Soft drips in the bathroom. At first, just a few drops. Then a steady trickle.

I wanted to believe it was a leak. I needed to believe it was a leak.

Then came the footsteps.

Slow. Deliberate.

Step. Pause. Step. Pause.

Coming down the hall.

I held my breath. My husband was asleep beside me. I wasn’t imagining this.

The steps stopped—right outside my door.

And then the doorknob rattled.

I must have made a noise—maybe I gasped, maybe I shifted too suddenly—because my husband stirred awake.

“What’s wrong?” he mumbled, groggy.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

We sat there, frozen. The house was so silent my ears rang. The air felt thick, suffocating.

And then, just as suddenly as it came, it was gone.

I don’t remember falling asleep. But when I woke up, the water had stopped.

And yet, I know what I heard.

I locked my bedroom door every night after that. Not for peace of mind, but because I had to. Because if I didn’t…

I don’t know.

Eventually, we moved. My husband and I got our own apartment, and for the first time, everything was fine. No footsteps. No missing objects. No shadow in the corner of my eye.

Then we moved again.

We had a baby boy. A new home. A fresh start.

But something is different.

I feel it again.

A drip in the bathroom.

A creak in the hall.

Footsteps.

I don’t think I’m alone.
