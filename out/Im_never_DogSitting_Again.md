Jeffrey, thank you again for being such a dear and watching Rex while I am away. I’ve included a simple list of instructions for you to make this easier. I hope he doesn’t give you too much trouble!

>Rex likes to sleep in the guest room on normal days, and typically won’t come out until around lunchtime. It’s best to not bother him until then anyway. 

>you’ll find his food dish and water bowl above the stove in the pantry, give him 1 scoop of wet food (found in the fridge) and 1 scoop of dry (above the washing machine) water bowl should be cleaned after every use and only use sink water with the Brita filter please. 

>Rex prefers the dark, please don’t turn on any lights in the house while you stay here. 

>sometimes he gets a little feisty in his old age. It’s best to ignore him when that happens. 

>if there is bad weather please lock him in the laundry as he gets very anxious. 

>if he needs to exercise or go for a walk, remember to go at night so he isn’t bothered by noise or neighbors. The leash and collar is under the sink. 

>He loves to watch the TV shows  *Dexter* and *Fuller House*

Money for yourself is on the table and keep the house keys on your person at all times. See you on Thursday! Thanks!- Mrs Lofton”

Side jobs are always odd ones aren’t they? 

I got the gig from a coworker right before the Christmas break when I said I needed some extra cash quick to buy some last minute gifts. 

They had known the Loftons for years. And Ever since her husband passed away, my coworker told me that she takes a trip this time of year to avoid feeling sad. But that dog is her best friend so naturally she wants the best care while she is gone. 

After putting in a good word for me, I was contacted with the instructions I transcribed above via email. A second secure message told me where the house was located. 

It wasn’t a big house, but typical for the neighborhood. The Big fenced in yard with a beware of dog sign attached made me almost reconsider. 

My coworker had said when he did this last year he had never even seen the dog at all, so why did I feel like I was being watched as I crossed the yard to the wrap around porch. 

The house keys were in the mailbox just like the secure message told me, and I could hear the tv playing as I unlatched the door. 

I could see immediately Mrs Lofton wasn’t kidding when she said she kept her house dark. All the windows were curtained and the blinds drawn. It was hard to really see much of anything in the front room foyer except a desk where she kept her mail piled up. 

Closing the door back, I used my smartphone to light the way into the den, listening for Rex to come tearing through the house at the sound of an intruder. 

It felt very weird to me to sit in a dark den in a stranger’s house and be completely alone. 

“Guess this is what I signed up for?” I muttered as I saw the dog’s dish not far from the entrance of the den. It was already empty which I guessed meant that he had eaten whatever she gave him before she left on her trip. 

I decided to go ahead and fill it up with the prescribed food, walking down the hall to the laundry. 

Big mistake really. When I passed by the guest room, I saw the silhouette of the dog laying there on the floor and I paused uncomfortably. I’m a dog person. I have two dogs at home. So why did this old husky make me feel uneasy? I couldn’t put my finger on it but decided to try and be friendly anyway. “Hey there boy, I’m Jeff,” I told him. The dog did not respond. 

I whistled to try and illicit a response but still got nothing so I just kept on walking to the laundry. 

As I reached for the dry food, I heard this low guttural noise from behind. Rex just making himself known, I told myself as I got the scoop and then walked back to the den. 

“Making you some supper. You want it now?” I muttered. This time I didn’t pause to look at the dog. When I finished mixing the two types of dog food together I shifted the bowl around to make noise and try and get Rex to come eat but no dice. 

“Guess you really do stick to your schedule,” I said to myself as I checked my phone. Something told me these five days were going to be either long and boring or filled with unease and I didn’t like either option really. 

I settled down in her wingback recliner and got on my phone. Of course the internet was shitty, I shouldn’t have expected any different but I just scrolled through my Instagram feed and snapchats, trying to pass the time until Rex made himself known. 

Every now and then I would glance up at the hallway which led to the guest room, hoping to see the husky romp out tiredly. Only half glancing, because it was dark.

For a second I thought I heard something and I waved my phone flashlight toward the hall. For that split moment I thought I saw Rex standing up on his hind legs. 

“Shit,” I fumbled with my phone and tried to get a better look. Nothing was there. 

I decided that freaky moment was the time to confront this dog. Maybe if I spent a little time with Rex he wouldn’t seem so scary to me. 

Walking to the guest room, I used my phone’s flashlight again and got a good look at Rex. 

There was nothing super special about the hound. He looked like he was half asleep, blind in one eye and snoring and shaking a little on the side of the bed. 

Actually, it looked like he was chewing on something, I realized as I took a step closer. 

The dog made a low growl, warning me to stay back; but curiosity got the better of me and I took a chance. 

It was a big rat. Half rotted away and stuck between the hound’s teeth and it’s paws, the thing looked like it had fought against Rex valiantly but ultimately lost. 

I took a step back into the hallway and tried to not panic. Was a dog able to eat a rat? 

I googled it and paced the kitchen, praying the internet would hurry up and give me an answer before the old dog wound up choking on its tiny bones. 

>It is instinctive for cats and dogs to pursue small prey, such as rodents and birds. In some cases, pets simply pursue and kill the prey. In other cases, the prey animal is consumed by pets.

I can’t tell you how relieved I was to read that answer. But I didn’t like the idea of the dog chewing on a rat even if it was instinct. Rats carry disease and if Mrs Lofton takes him to the vet a month from now she’ll know what happened. 

I decided to try and goad Rex with his leash and collar  for a walk. 

“Come on boy, let’s go around the block,” I told him. The hound immediately stood up and stretched, whining irritably as he trotted toward me. 

“That’s a good boy, you aren’t so bad are ya?” I said, carefully placing the collar on him. He kept making low noises. I couldn’t tell if it was because he was uneasy around me or because he was still swallowing the last of that rat. 

Once the collar and leash were on, I tugged him to the front door. 

“Mrs Lofton has you on a tight schedule but maybe we can shake things up?” I suggested as we headed toward the street. 

Rex was hesitantly sniffing the ground and meandering down the street like any normal dog, and for a brief moment I was sure that everything would turn out fine. 

Then one of the neighbors jogged by and Rex pulled me like a freight train, barking as his floppy ears jostled from side to side. 

The woman let out a soft cry of alarm and I tried to calm her as I pulled Rex but he wasn’t listening. He was reacting like any good watchdog and was ready to attack. 

“Just ignore him, he’s old!” I said, straining to pull him towards me. 

Rex turned and bit at my hand, and I lost my grip on his leash. In a heartbeat he was down the street yelping and barking. The neighbor had jumped out of the way and was long gone, but if I didn’t hurry Rex would be too. 

“Stupid dog,” I muttered as I got up and followed after him. I knew he would have to give up eventually. 

About ten minutes later that was exactly what happened and I grabbed the leash and yanked Rex toward me. 

“Consider this the last walk you’ll get for five days,” I muttered as I marched back to Mrs Lofton’s house. The hound tried to pull against me but I was firm. I felt a little bad for him but I wasn’t about to lose him in another frantic race. 

Once inside, I let him free and latched the door back, collapsing on the kitchen floor and tossing the house keys on the table. That was exhausting, I thought to myself as I watched him run to his water bowl. 

“You’re more of a handful than I bargained for bud,” I muttered as I went over and took off his leash. The dog stood stiff as if he was about to bite me again but only growled in response. 

“Yeah yeah, all bark and no bite,” I said as I sunk back down in the recliner. 

I just wanted to relax for a few minutes, maybe get a Power Nap. But Rex had other ideas. 

Just as my eyelids got heavy and I was drifting to dreamland, the husky let out a loud bark that nearly made me jump to the ceiling. He sat there, staring at me dead eyed as I was in the recliner. 

“What do you want?” I asked, he barked loud again and I realized he wanted in the chair. “Fine, sure. It’s your house,” I said as he climbed in the recliner at the moment I got out of it. 

“You watch your programs. I’m going to get some sleep,” I told the dog dismissively. I kept it on Netflix and walked to the guest room, collapsing on the bed. 

That race across the neighborhood had drained me and it was only day one. 

Closing my eyes, I kept thinking that Rex was going to come in the room and demand something with more sharp barks. 

Maybe it was my tired brain, but I felt certain the dog did come in the room and climb on my chest. I kept feeling this heavy pressure against my torso. 

And I kept fading in and out of being asleep, his dead eyes staring at me when I was awake. 
This dog was pushing my buttons. 

When I did wake up, I found Rex was still in the recliner, sitting almost like a person would as he watched his tv. 

“Hope you’re cozy,” I told him as I walked over to the fridge to see what Mrs Lofton had left me to eat. 

I’m not sure why I didn’t notice it before but when I opened the door this time and looked at the shelves I realized the only things that weren’t for Rex were a block of cheese and some prescription meds. 

“Jesus you really are spoiled,” I said aloud as I closed the fridge back. I walked over to the table to grab the house keys, only to realize they were no longer there. 
Crap. 

They must have fallen off when I tossed them, I realized as I checked the grimy floor. 
 
Again my phone was the only illumination as I crawled under the table and tried to see where they might have fallen. 

Just as I scanned the light toward the den, I saw the silhouette of Rex again and froze in place. This time there was no mistaking it. He was walking on his back legs to the guest room. 

What the hell? 

I scrambled up from the floor and pointed the light at him. “Here boy!” I told the dog. He turned and looked at me, still somehow standing upright like it was perfectly normal and didn’t blink. 

Then he dropped back to four legs and trotted into the guest room, somehow kicking the door closed and leaving me alone with the conundrum. 

“I just need to get some air,” I told myself as I searched for the keys. 

That was when I saw them, hanging up above the stove. How did they get there…? 

Had Rex… put them there? But that was impossible. 

I was just about to reach for them when my phone rang. Mrs Lofton. 

“Hey, perfect timing. I had a question for you.” 

Before I could even talk she interrupted with a request for her dog. I did my best to not roll my eyes. 

“Sure. What is it?” I asked. 

She told me that he would need his favorite toy and that she kept that toy in the basement near the water heater. 

“Basement? Past the laundry right? Got it,” I said, turning and walking down the steps carefully. I had her on speakerphone as I commented, “Mrs Lofton, has anyone ever told you how weird Rex is?” 

t wasn’t hard to miss the toy. Looked like an old Cabbage Patch doll. 

“Has he been good for you?” Mrs Lofton also asked as I reached down and grabbed the doll. 

“That’s one way of putting it. He enjoyed his walk earlier,” I commented. 

As soon as I said it, I regretted telling her because it went against her rigorous instructions. 

“It was fine,” I reassured her. 

I turned to go back up the stairs when I heard this soft slam and felt my heart drop. 

“Let me call you back,” I said as I was now in pitch darkness. Somehow the basement door had closed on me. No worries. Just had to get up the steps. 

Then I reached for the handle and just as I was going to open it I heard it snap and lock. 

Then I heard a low growl. Rex…? 

What the hell. How did the fucking dog lock me in the basement?

“Hey! Hey listen to me this isn’t funny! Let me out!” I said as I banged on the door. 

Only the low growl responded. 

This was insane. I sighed and turned back toward the basement, using my phone to get a good look around. 

Maybe I could get out of here some other way. 

I carefully climbed down the stairs, nearly tripping over more of Rex’s toys. Then I went toward the back wall to see if there was some hidden chute or something. But nothing was visible except for crates of dog food. 

“Jesus this dog eats more than I do,” I muttered as I checked it. Most of it was expired. It was no wonder Rex seemed so sickly. 

I slumped on the floor, feeling defeated and tired. If the dog wanted to lock me down here so be it. I could deal with that for a few days, probably piss on the floor and eat dog food to survive. I wasn’t sure what I would do about water but I figured something had to go right after this shitty day. 

For a moment I also considered calling the police. But I knew that might cause more problems for me in the long run. If Mrs Lofton found out I did something this monumentally stupid I could kiss my paycheck goodbye. 

Instead I decided to text my girlfriend. Signal was bad now with the doors closed and I could hear a storm approaching. Rex would probably tear up the house while I was down here. I had to hope she could help me get out of here. 

>you’re locked in a basement?? 

Her response made it sound like she thought this was my fault. 

>look I’m not here to tell you the details. Can you help or what? 

>I don’t get off work until after 10. 

>well it’s not like I’m going anywhere. 

I slipped the phone into my back pocket and walked up the stairs, attempting again to jiggle the door open. I couldn’t hear Rex but for some reason I was sure the dog was somewhere nearby. 

“Hey you stupid dog. My girlfriend is coming by to get me out of here. And you better be nice when she gets here,” I muttered. 

I wasn’t sure exactly how Denise would even get in the house but she was resourceful. She had to figure something out, I thought as I grit my teeth and sat on the steps. 

First thing I do is lock Rex down here as payback, I thought sourly as rain began to pelt the house. I could hear the husky beginning to whine and bark, the storm upsetting him just like Mrs Lofton had said it would. 

Then I heard the sound of glass breaking and the dog clawing against a door. He was panicking and so was I. How the hell was I going to fix this mess?

I sighed and listened as the dog kept destroying the house and I was powerless to stop him. So much for that pay, I thought. 

No. Get a hold of yourself Jeff, you have three more days. You can figure this out. 

Finally it was nearly 10: 30 at night and Rex had settled, Denise told me she was on her way and I listened for her car to pull up. The storm had subsided too, so I could hear everything that happened. 

First I heard her brakes and the car engine turn off followed by her calling my name as she opened the front gate. 

>this place is so creepy! Is this dog dangerous?

I wasn’t sure how to respond to that. Rex had reacted so strongly to that stranger earlier. What if he attacked my girlfriend?

>just try to hurry. I can’t be stuck down here for three more days! 

Denise texted back that the front door was actually wide open. 

>that’s impossible. I locked it. 

Denise’s  response wasn’t very reassuring. 

>well u did say this dog can open and close doors right? 

I felt my heart skip a beat as I imagined Rex was off running around somewhere, but I couldn’t worry about that. I told her to hurry to the basement. 

>power is out. I can’t see a thing. 

I listened for her, trying to bang on the door to get her attention.  

Instead I heard Rex make a terrible noise. It didn’t sound like a dog at all. 

Denise let out a scream and Rex matched her tone and volume with every decibel. Then I heard the dog bounding toward her and I frantically tried to open the door again as I heard my girlfriend fall to the floor. 

Her screaming continued as I heard the dog barking and snarling. I knew how vicious this dog could be, and all I could was try to attract its attention to the basement. 

Loud banging and crashing filled the air for the next few minutes as Denise valiantly fought the dog. Then finally the entire house went silent. 

I held my breath and waited. Did she win? Did Rex kill her? I reached for my phone and texted her. 

I heard it softly ping somewhere in the house and I clenched my fist. If that dog had hurt her I would make sure it never saw the light of day. 

Instead a moment later, the basement door unlatched and it opened. Denise was standing there, covered in scratches and fresh blood. I couldn’t do much except hug her. 

Then I immediately put my guard up and searched for the dog. Rex was nowhere to be seen. 

Guiding her to the guest room, I told Denise to stay there while I found the dog and put an end to this. 

It was still pitch dark. And I knew that the husky could probably see me before I saw it. 

I moved to the den, searching for the fireplace poker. It would have to be a makeshift weapon. 

I heard a low creaking noise and nearly jumped out of my skin. The front door was open. I ran to the yard, realizing the gate was also open. Rex had escaped. 

My first thought was good riddance. Then my phone buzzed. Mrs Lofton. 

“I’m quitting,” I told my neighbor. 

“This dog is insane. I got locked in the basement almost all night and then Rex attacked my girlfriend!” 

As I walked back into the kitchen, the power turned on and the lights flickered. 

Mrs Lofton hadn’t responded to my announcement so I asked if she heard me. 

She claimed that Rex would never hurt anyone. Not her dog. She insisted that I video chat with her and I sighed in frustration, nearly jumping out of my skin again when I saw Rex at the end of the hall. 

“There you are, you motherfucking monster,” I said as I pulled up the video chat and walked to the hallway. 

“You see? Rex is covered in my girl’s blood!” I said focusing the camera on the husky. 

I stood by the guest room and unlatched the door, telling Denise we were leaving. 

My eyes caught sight of something on the floor. A mess of hair and skin. My blood went cold and my breath caught in my throat. 

It looked like a cocoon of flesh. Peeled and dried out as if discarded. 

What the hell…. 

Mrs Lofton’s face was pale and full of fear. And immediately she told me why. That wasn’t her dog. 

I looked toward the husky and watched as the dog stood up on its hind legs again. 

This time it’s fur began to rescind and become skin. It’s face distorting to resemble my girlfriend. Naked and still covered in scratches, the fake Denise stepped toward me, half of her body still in the shape of the monstrous dog. 

I stumbled into the guest room, realizing the pound of flesh I had seen was what this creature had done to my real girlfriend. And then I dropped the phone and ran toward the door. 

The fake Denise shrieked and bounded toward me, shifting between dog and human as it tried to attack. 

I made it to my car and revved the engine, the creature standing in the middle of the street as it howled. Sounding like a scream and a bark all at once. I pushed down on the pedals and slammed into the creature, flinging it over my windshield and shattering the glass. I didn’t look back. 

I kept driving until I made it home and finally caught my breath. 

The next day I used my brother’s phone and contacted the police, telling them everything that I knew they would believe. They asked me to come to Lofton’s residence so we met around ten that morning. 

Much to my surprise, Mrs Lofton had returned home. 

As the police explained the claim I made about Denise, my neighbor gave a confused look. She claimed to not even own a dog. The police searched the residence and found only the old dog food. She said Rex had died a few years ago. And there wasn’t anything to show that Denise had ever been there. 

Visibly frustrated, the police left and warned me about making a false statement. I stood at the edge of the yard, staring at them in utter defeat and then toward Mrs Lofton on her porch. She was smiling and waved as they left. And I swear to you, I saw something behind her thin frame. A tail wagging. 

Her eyes shimmered for a second as she stared at me and I immediately drove off. 

That thing had lured me here and likely planned to kill me originally before Denise showed up. 

I told my coworker to never take a job for her again. And I told myself that I’m never dog sitting again.
