I grew up here in Southern Georgia. I know these trees, and I know these mountains. Ever since I was a girl, I have dreamed about hiking the Appalachian trail, spending those six delectable months far away from humanity. I have loved these trees and mountains for as long as I can remember, and nothing hurts me more than seeing more and more bald patches on the mountains as the years go by. 

Every year developers take more and more from the mountains, and they never pay for the mountains back for what they have taken. Every time I drive by, I see the oozing wounds they inflict, and I feel sorry for the workers. The workers are the ones who are going to have to deal with the problems. They are the ones who are really going to pay the price for the greed of these developers. Every time I think about that, I resolve to tell the mountain who to punish, but then I forget about it as quickly as I think it. 

Things are already starting to get bad. Last week a tree fell and crushed a truck full of lumberjacks. This week four work men went missing, and no one knows what happened. 

I looked at the Facebook page set up by grieving wives and families begging for volunteers to come out and search the area. I clicked the “more info” tab, and I showed up the next day.

It was weird for me to show up. I could tell that a lot of these people were friends and family of the disappeared. I was quite visibly the odd one out there, but so my expertise was appreciated because I also knew the area. I walked up, and a police officer made me a team leader for four other people. 

The four didn’t seem to know one another, and they were all older than me. Fun times would be had. 

“Hi,” I said, forcing a smile.

“Hi.” they respond, forcing smiles right back.

The eldest man of the group took initiative. “I’m Jeremy. My brother was one of the men that disappeared.” Jeremy was an old balding and bearded man; I would say around mid-50s. He seemed at peace with his area, and only looked a little shifty. Jeremy looked like the kind of guy that would agree to fix your roof and disappear after the first check cleared.

I nodded. “I’m Moriah, everyone calls me Mo, and I saw the Facebook page.” I cringed at the fake name I gave. I nervously adjusted my rifle strap. “I grew up around here, and I know this area pretty well.” No one seemed to question me, so we moved on to the next person.

“I’m Gertrude,” an older woman said stiffly. “My friends call me Gertie,” she tacked on as though she didn’t want to come off as rude. Gertie was grey and grimacing, constantly tugging at her coat to keep warm. “My son.” Her grimace deepened, and she looked down. No one pushed her to continue.

“I’m Andrew,” a man interjected when Gertrude’s silence lapsed a little too long. “My friends call me Drew.” Drew was one of those boyish looking guys that looked like they were mid-thirties but because of diet and exercise were actually probably somewhere in their 60s. He actually looked at peace, like he was a walking tour throughout the Georgia mountains and not an expedition. “My son in law works on the team, but he’s not one of the ones that went missing.” He smiled and looked around giddily as though he couldn’t wait to start his hike.

We all looked expectantly at the last holdout, a broody old man that had a frown permanently etched onto his face. He was the best dressed out of the group, everything on him was boldly branded and obviously new. It looked like he went to a hiking store the day before and bought whatever the sales assistant told him to buy. Even his boots looked brand spanking new, and I felt bad for the guy, the blisters he would get. He puffed out his chest and threw back his shoulders and looked *me* in the eyes like he had something to prove. “My name is Charles,” he said a little snippily. His voice shocked all of us. Everyone else had the classic American deep southern accent, even I hadn’t escaped without my twang, but this man was British. His accent sounded “posh,” like the fake accent that people on TV use to imitate British people. Charles sniffed and looked uncomfortable with the gawking everyone was doing. Charles sniffed again, “I am the primary stake holder of this company.”

“That’s nice.” I said as dread poured down my spine and seeped into my voice. This guy was going to be a pain in my ass. The other three members of the group went from gawking to glaring. No one who was tangentially related to his company wanted to be on the same search team as him. 

“TEAM LEADS!” a police officer with a megaphone yelled. “Team leads please come to the center and retrieve your assignments and provisions for your group!” 

I smiled at my group and pointed toward the officer. “Stay put, and I’ll be right back.”

“So, if we move, you won’t come back?” Andrew asked as though he made a joke.

I gave him a pained smile and a double thumbs up. I got in line with the other leads. One volunteer handed me color print outs with the employee badge photos and identifying information of the missing workers, and another handed me a satellite radio. Yet another gave me a plastic grocery bag of sack lunches for my group. I stuffed what would fit into my backpack and carried the sack lunches. I approached an officer who pointed to a section on the outer edge of the map.

“This is where your group will search,” he peeled a bright pink sticker labeled 4D and stuck it on my shoulder. He then pointed at the map again. “We will drop you off here,” he said pointing at the innermost corner of 4D “Search your quadrant, and we will pick you guys back up from there at 4 PM.” 

I nodded stiffly and wondered if he gave me the worst quadrant because Charles was in my group. 

The officer handed me the map and dismissed me.

I couldn’t help but grip my rifle strap, because now I knew I was going to need it. The deepest part of the mountain…

I got back to my group and explained our assignment to them. They all balked. None of them expected to be so far out into the mountains. Hell, I didn’t expect to be so far out either. 

“Hold on a minute, I gotta go back to my car *really* quick,” Jeremy said, already jogging to the parking area before I could say anything. 

The others looked at me, as though hoping they could make similar escapes. I handed them their sack lunches.

To be fair, Jeremy was back very quickly; he hadn’t been gone a whole five minutes. He came jogging back loading a sturdy rifle.

“Jesus, do all you Americans carry weapons on a search and rescue?” Charles asked aghast. 

“No,” Andrew said, a bit distressed.

“Well, it’s only mid-October,” I said.

Charles looked at us Americans blankly.

“The last of the bears haven’t gone into hibernation,” Gertrude helpfully supplied.

“And the remaining ones are starving, they’ll eat anything before they have to hibernate.” Jeremy finished off. He looked even more shifty, like he was leaving an important detail out. He looked at me to see if I bought it and could tell I hadn’t. This made him look more relieved because from then on, he knew that I knew.

I handed Jeremy his sack lunch and led the group to the Jeep that would take us to our drop off point. 

We all spent the 30-minute ride looking at the photos of the missing employees. All of us except Andrew, who spent the entire ride pestering the driver. “Was he from here? Has he been here long? Oh, I moved here two years ago to be near my daughter. Do you have kids? I have all girls. What about you? Two boys? That’s great! Oh, what about grandkids? They’ll come soon, look here’s a photo of my grandkids. You look great, are you on a diet? Keto? No, I’m vegan. You should really-” I tuned him out.

I wanted to slap (maybe no stabbing) him. I instead looked at the first face on the list, Daniel K., A Caucasian man in his 30s, 6’1” and lean. He had brown hair and green eyes. The next one down was a woman, 5’8” and also lean, her name is Sarah C. with red hair and brown eyes. She also seems to be in her 30s. Luke L. was next on the list. He was also tall at 6’4” and in his late 30s with greying brown hair and brown eyes. Last but not least was Kristopher L. He appeared to be Luke’s younger brother and shared a lot of the same features but was an inch shorter at 6’3”. I did my best to memorize the names and faces of the missing four.

I glanced over at Gertrude, whose hand shakily hovered over Daniel’s face, her eyes near tears. I couldn’t help but feel bad for her since we were being sent so far out to a place where her son could be. Chances are he and his friends didn’t get this far on foot.

We were dropped off in front of a decrepit watch tower. The driver reminded us to be back at 4 pm and commented that he might be late since we would be the last on his list for pick up. We nodded and waved him goodbye.

I checked the satellite phone for both connection and time, both with full bars and full battery. My teammates and I checked their cell phones and declared that none of us had a signal. All except Charles, who had his own sat phone, probably because he was rich and didn’t want to be stranded no matter what.

“Okay!” I clapped my hands and got everyone’s attention. This reminded me of my years as a camp counselor. “We are going to stay together and only have two feet of separation between us at all times!” I looked each of them in the eyes to make sure they were all getting the memo. “We will comb our section of the forest once, maybe twice, before our deadline.” Despite the eye contact, I’m starting to lose Charles. “We will call out a name on our list then wait 30 seconds to a minute for a response.” I looked at them, and they looked back at me. Jeremy to my surprise had flipped his rifle from his back to resting in his arms. He’s looking over my left shoulder, and while his finger isn’t on the trigger, he’s tapping the edge as though he’s ready to shoot if necessary. I caught his eye.

He gave a small shake of the head.

I didn’t turn around. None of the other members of the group seemed to notice anything. I continued, “If someone finds anything, report it and wait for the rest of the group and we will assess from there. At NO POINT” I looked at all of them and glared extra hard at Charles. “WILL WE SEPARATE BEYOND TWO FEET” I stared at them. “NO ONE WILL GO OFF ON THEIR OWN. IF YOU SEE SOMEONE GOING OFF ON THEIR OWN,” I stopped, not for effect, but for Jeremy’s finger landing on the trigger. 

He gave me a look that told me not to say anything, like a silent agreement between us.

“INFORM THE GROUP.” I said, looking at all of them as Jeremy relaxed and a presence I didn’t even realize was there left. “If you need to the go to the bathroom, inform the group. DO NOT GO ANYWHERE BY YOURSELF. ALWAYS TAKE A BUDDY.”

They nodded.

I took a deep breath. “If you see a set of stairs, do not go up the stairs. If you see what looks like a human but looks a little off, stop moving and grab the person next to you. DO NOT CALL OUT. If you see a wild animal, do not try to scare it or shoot it.” I give a look to Jeremy, he nods. “DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING.”

Everyone but Jeremy looked concerned, but they nodded, nonetheless. 

I unfolded the map and pointed out a zig zag horizontally. “We will go in and out and always end on our workman’s road” I pointed at the dirt road in front of us. The group nodded. “Around 12 or 1 when we reach the road again, we’ll break for lunch.” They nodded again and with a little apprehension we began to step off the dirt road and walk into the forest. “And before I forget, one,” I pointed at myself. “Two,” I pointed at Gertie. “Three,” I pointed at Andrew. “Four,” I pointed at Jeremy. “And five,” I pointed at Charles. “Okay, roll call. One.”

I looked at Gertie. “T-two.”

We all looked at Andrew. “Three, he said confidently.

“Four.” Jeremy said without prompting.

Charles looked at us defiantly, his face turning pink.

We looked back at Charles, waiting for his response.

His face went from pink to red, and he glared at us. 

“Charles, what’s wrong with you?” I ask.

“Like you don’t know!” he spat.

“No, I don’t know. What’s wrong with you?” I placed my hands on my hips.

“Why am I last?” he growled stomping his feet like a toddler.

“You were the furthest to my right,” I replied steadily.

Charles looked stunned and then looked to his left to see I said the numbers in order from right to left. “Oh, we do it the other way around in England,” he lied.

We still all looked at him expecting him to say his number. 

“Five,” he mumbled.

“DANIEL!” Gertie yelled out and waited. We hear no response. “DANIEL!” she repeated.

We started our search, trying to look at the ground and our surrounding area for possible clues. I looked up at the tree branches, something felt wrong- like something was up there watching us. Every once in a while, I scanned the distance through my rifle’s sight. I looked at my teammates. To my left Andrew looked at peace, as though he was enjoying a nice hike with friends instead of searching for the possibly deceased. He was even taking pictures. On the other side of him Charles was the exact opposite. He looked extremely bored and put out, a man that is not used to hiking or exercise. To my right Gertie clutched her chest and yelled out for her son, hardly looking down to see where she should place her feet. On the other side of her, Jeremy held his rifle and walked easily through the woods, never tripping and forever vigilant.

“I couldn’t help but notice that you said you had grandkids,” Charles said wheezing to who I assumed was Andrew.

Andrew looked shocked, but smiled and said, “Yes!  I have four kids and ten grandkids.” The number shocked all of us but Gertie, who was focused on finding her own son. “The eldest is fifteen, and the youngest is two.” The moment those words left his mouth, I felt a presence-the same foreboding feeling of being watched from earlier. The mention of children has caught something’s attention.

Jeremy also felt the change. (period) “You look so young! Do you work out?” he said.

“Yes! I do! I do CrossFit on the weekends, and I teach yoga at my own studio in town. You know I went to India and learned from the Yogis there. I mean it! Real first-hand stuff!” Andrew went on a tirade about Yogis and how none of the Yogis here knew what they were talking about. This continued for about an hour, all while Gertie called out for her missing son. “You really have to go to India to find the true meaning of yoga.” The presence I felt had drifted away again, like even it was bored of his rambling. 

“Dan-!“ Gertie stopped in her tracks, looking at the tree line. We followed her gaze and saw what had shocked Gertie. A ragged doll stared back down at us.

She was a Barbie, her hair fried, and her eyes gouged out with marker. She was naked except for the bramble of twigs tied at her waist, giving her a strange twig dress. She hung by her neck in the tree, swaying gently from side to side.

“What is that?” Charles asked. “Is this some kind of trick?”

“Ooky spooky scary skeletons,” I mumbled and started to walk, leading the group away from the macabre scene. From then on, we were silent. We saw several more Barbies of different colors on our way, all naked except for twig dresses, and all hanging by their necks. Glaring down at us.

We eventually reached the fence that bordered the end of our quadrant. I pulled out the map and looked at our compass and my watch. “We’re making good timing!” I looked up and met my own eyes. Across the fence was me, to her left Andrew, then Charles, then to her right Gertie and Jeremy. We held ourselves somberly on the other side, our faces pale and lackluster.

Gertie let out a gasp and lunged forward, “DANIEL!” she screamed as she tried to scramble towards the fence. Jeremy grabbed her by her collar and yanked. Behind the mirror version of us were the missing four. Pale with their eyes dark and sunken, their lips blue and chapped. Their fingertips were also edged with blue. 

I pulled the lever action of my rifle back, locking a live round into place. Mirror me and I leveled rifles at our own heads. “Leave,” I snarled. 

We both took a step forward, taking the safety off of our rifles. “Come here.” A mockery of my voice replied. 

I lowered my rifle. “LEAVE!” I screamed out. I stomped my feet and shook my arms with such ferocity the mirror me struggled to keep up. To my surprise Charles caught on first and began to dance a jig which mirror self struggles to imitate.

“GO!” he shouted as he moved manically.

“GET OUT OF HERE!” Andrew did what I can only imagine some Buddhist monk scammed him into thinking were martial arts moves. Which he did quickly enough to confuse his mirror self.

“DANIEL!” Gertie moaned. She struggled harder against Jeremy’s vice like grip, which conversely made her mirror struggle to keep up with her.

Jeremy who was busy keeping Gertrude from certain death, still yelled out to the demon. “GET OUT OF HERE AND LEAVE US ALONE!”

With that our mirror selves and the missing four disappeared.

Gertrude went limp and began to wail. She went from struggling to get away from Jeremy to clinging to the man. “My boy! Daniel! My boy!” she wailed against him. She gripped him white knuckled by the shirt and looked him in the eyes. “My boy! He was right there!” she pointed frantically to the other side of the fence. “He was right there!” Tears streamed down her face.

“Gertrude.” I said stepping towards her. “Gertie, you know that wasn’t him. You just wanted it to be him.”

She glared at me something fierce.

“Gertrude!” Charles shouted.

Gertrude jumped.

“That wasn’t yer boi and ye kno it.” His voice to our surprised changed. No longer was it that weird polished tv posh accent. “That was fae if I ever saw it!” He looked down in shock and dismay. “I wish I never saw it.” He mumbled. “The other side of that fence was the other side of this life! Surely you don’t want to follow yer boi there, do ye now?”

Gertrude continued to glare. “It would have been my choice! It should have been my choice!” She began to wail again. I approached her.

“That wasn’t your son, you wouldn’t’ve gone to your son.” I told her. “It knew what we were looking for and showed us what we wanted to find. It was a lazy creature setting a lazy trap.” I placed my hand under her arm and we moved a little northward and began to walk back towards the road in silence. None of us wanted to bring attention to ourselves for a while. 

Andrew finally spoke up. “So, did we kill it?” he asked.

“No.” Jeremy replied. “We just proved to be more effort than it’s worth.” He looked to me. “It was a lazy creature with a lazy trap.” He agreed. “It wanted us to run willy nilly right into its mouth.” He looked at Gertrude, who still didn’t look entirely convinced we’d just saved her life.

“If that was true, why didn’t we just walk away from the creature?” Charles asked. “Why did we have to dance it away?”

“Because the whole mirror image was its mouth.” I responded. “I think the fence was a barrier it couldn’t cross, but I don’t like risking the lives of those I’m in charge of with ‘I thinks’.” 

The Barbies watched us as we passed to the road. We stopped and took a water break for about ten minutes, and we steeled ourselves for another pass. Avoiding eye contact with the ever watchful Barbies, we make it to the fence and turn back. Once we were back at the dirt road we stopped for lunch. We took out our soggy ham and egg salad sandwiches, and I forced down a few bites before gagging and putting it back in my pack. I switched to my granola bars.

“Can you not stomach it either?” Charles asked me, also stuffing his sandwich back into his bag. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. 

I shook my head and picked up the sat phone. I send a message saying we’ve stopped for lunch and haven’t found any sign of the missing workers. 

“Ask if they can pick us up early,” Charles requested.

I nodded and typed out a message about an early pick up. I chewed my granola bar and sipped my water.

“Charles, you mind if I bum one off of you?” Jeremy asked.

Charles held out the pack to him and Jeremy took a cigarette along with Charles’s lighter.

Andrew looked on in disgust. “I can’t stand this,” he said getting up. “I’m going to the gentleman’s room.” Andrew dusted himself off.

I received a reply from HQ. “Wait, you can’t go by yourself.”

The two other men settled deeper into their cigarettes.

Gertrude sighed and stood up. 

Andrew looked a little taken aback by this. “I don’t think- “

“I’ll be standing behind a tree,” Gertrude said. “I promise” she cajoled.

*Negative on early pick up. Unless there is a medical emergency or the missing personnel are found, your pickup will be at 4 PM sharp. No sign of the missing workmen from the other search and rescue teams, please keep looking*.

*-HQ*

I read the message out loud to the two men in front of me. 

They both huffed and puffed figuratively and literally.

“Moriah,” Jeffery says out of nowhere. “Mo…”

I jump at the call of my fake name, I didn’t expect to be included in the small talk. “Yes, Jeremy?” 

 

“Well, you see…About Gertrude,” We heard a rattle in the woods and looked into the forest as Andrew and Gertrude make their way back. 

Jeremy gives us looks as though to say*, I didn’t say anything!*

“We’re not being picked up early.” Charles huffed. 

Andrew frowned and sat down next to the men, “We can wait a bit longer.” He said shrugging. 

Gertie sat next to me and looked strangely at Andrew.

“You ok, Gertie?” I asked her gently.

“No, not really,” she replied. “I just hope someone finds them and quick, so we can just go home.” She wrapped her arms around herself.

“I want to go home too!” Andrew said loudly. “I can’t wait to see my wife! And my children! And my grandchildren! They’re all so cute I could eat them up!” he smiled so broadly it freaked me out.

*His eyes* I thought. *His smile doesn’t reach his eyes anymore…*
