Hello readers of r/nosleep! My younger brother recommended that I come on here for some advice, but I am admittedly a skeptic. Hell, if I wasn't so desperate I wouldn't have even considered it, but I feel like I'm on the verge of losing my fucking mind.

For some basic context, my wife and I purchased/moved into our first home together a year ago. Everything was going great besides the occasional giant bug and the torrent of ridiculous mosquitos coming from the swamp just behind our modest backyard. The neighborhood wasn't the fanciest, but there was no HOA and the police station was only a block away. We, naively, believed that we would be free to live our peaceful couch potato existence in peace. As of about a month ago, I'm convinced that *something* is messing with me and my wife. 

It started out subtle, as these things seem to tend to do according to the little I've read. To be frank: the house started to smell like shit. For three nights we woke up sometime after midnight to the most wretched gut wrenching stench you can imagine. At first we thought that Rosie, our 90lb 11 year old pup, had just had some horrendous gas, but it was simply impossible given the location and ferocity of it. After about an hour on the first night, it subsided in what seemed like mere seconds. That morning, I checked the toilets, sink, and attic for anything that could've possibly caused the smell. I thought that maybe something had died in the chimney or the walls somehow, or even that our shitty city's sewer line was backed up. 

Then it came back the second night (at around the same time, my wife and I can't agree on what time we had been awoken. She SWEARS that it was at 1:12 am every night, but I clearly remember it being more like 2:30), and it definitely freaked us out. 
That night carried on just like the night before it, just with a little less initial confusion and a lot more anxious pacing. The third night really fucked with us, and even Rosie started freaking out when the smell came. 

I called a handyman that my mom recommended as soon as possible and practically begged the guy to prioritize my house like some selfish asshole. Luckily, the guy was a family friend and could see that I was starting to lose it. 

He looked everywhere and found nothing. 

The smell hasn't been back since, but it has been replaced by something. 

Nightmares.

Horrible, fucking insane nightmares. The kinda stuff you would see in some twisted cartoon on YouTube. For me the nightmares mostly consisted of being tortured by these little goblin creatures in a cave. It was so trippy and honestly still has me freaked out. They started out random, the only oddity being that my wife and I seemed to get shitty sleep on the same random nights for a couple weeks. We just assumed it was because of the sketchy delta 9 vape we bought and the amount of melatonin we had become to rely on. It wasn't pleasant, and it was certainly weird as hell, but it wasn't every night and it only lasted a couple hours at most. 

That is until a week ago, when after a few hours of what felt like sweet dreams, I woke up in the middle of my backyard. I was sprawled out in the wet, unkempt lawn beside our small gardening shed that came with the home. It was pitch black outside, and I immediately started freaking out. I looked down at my naked body, despite the fact that I had been wearing shorts to bed. How the fuck did I get outside? Am I about to get murdered? My gut instinct was to get inside to relative safety, and I quickly ran to my backdoor. 

Locked.

How the fuck did I get back here if the door is locked from the inside? Did I *really* piss my wife off? I knew for a fact it wasn't anyone's birthday or anniversary. Regardless, I didn't have a key so my only hope was to bang on the glass and hope it woke my wife up. I yelled to her, probably startling a few neighbors as I knocked on the screen door. My wife, confused and horrified and definitely pissed off that I had woken her up, came waddling to the door wrapped in a blanket and quickly ushered me inside. A confused bout of anxious yelling ensued until my wife had heard the whole story. I was truly shaken and had no idea what to do. My wife didn't notice anything. Our security system hadn't been disabled until my wife woke up to let me in. So how the hell did I sleepwalk into my backyard and decide to lay down? We had a few large windows that could be climbed through if you slid aside the screen, but that would've been detected by the security system. The only reasonable explanation was sleepwalking, but it just made no sense. 

I did it again last night. 

After 5 days of peaceful sleep, I was startled awake by a mosquito tickling my cheek, its disgusting proboscis (or whatever its called) looked so imposing when I first opened my eyes that I thought I was on an operating table staring down on a massive needle before my vision could adjust to the lack of light. My legs and arms felt numb, and I struggled to move my hand as it seemed like all of the strength had been sapped from my body. I watched through gritted teeth as the mosquito gorged itself, piercing the skin on my cheek and slowly filling itself with crimson nectar. It didn't hurt, but the sheer helplessness I felt in that moment was beyond surreal. it was like I was being tortured and I had no idea why. 

After a what seemed like hours, I felt my strength return to my limbs and I was able to slowly pull myself to my feet, solemnly wrapping against my back door in defeat. I fought back tears as my wife rushed to my aid, embracing me as a sobbed against her shoulder. She stayed awake with me. I was too afraid to go back to sleep.

My wife and I have been taking turns having fearful breakdowns all day, and have no idea what to do. We can't afford much right now, so a trip to a psychologist is going to have to wait. We are going to set some security cameras up in the hopes that we can at least figure out how I am getting outside. 

It's become hard for me to fall asleep. I'm terrified of what, or who, is bringing me outside. I'm just so tired, and I feel like can't think straight anymore. I know I'm a skeptic, but if there is anything I can do to keep everyone safe or get to the bottom of what's going on, I'm all ears.
