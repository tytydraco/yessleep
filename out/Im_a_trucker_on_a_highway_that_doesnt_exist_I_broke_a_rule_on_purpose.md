*No really. Don’t go onto side streets. We shouldn’t have to dedicate two entire subsections to this one rule, but you’ve all clearly proven we do, so just don't.* 

*DON’T.*

After the whole incident with Gloria and the thing in the dark, Randall gave me a week off. 

There was the physical trauma of it all (i.e. apparently you need stitches when someone literally bites a chunk from your neck?), but also just the mental exhaustion. I’d spent two weeks barely sleeping, driving 16+ hour days, slowly devolving into an anxious, self-loathing wreck. On top of that, I was now dealing with the knowledge that me and every one of my co-workers would one day be offered up as kindling for the fire that was ‘protecting humanity.’ *Oh, and by the way, you can’t tell them.* A week off sounded amazing.

Until it wasn’t.

It’s funny. We complain about work and errands and all the little things that add up to a stressful existence, but when they’re gone? We get bored so quickly.

Maybe that’s just me. I had no family or friends in California. I rarely watched TV. All my hobbies had disappeared years ago, along with my childhood belief that being a fully functioning adult was an achievable goal. It was on day four, around the umpteenth time I was considering calling my ex, Myra―because that’s what you do when you’re bored and spiraling―that I called Randall instead.

“You sure you’re ready to come back?” he asked.

“Nope.” I sighed. “But I’m coming anyway.”

“Did you at least use your time to finish the employee handbook?”

“Uh… sure.”

*Whoops.*

\*\*\*

Over the next week, Randall and I settled into a tentative sort of…*truce,* shall we say?

We didn’t stop hating each other. I didn’t stop glaring at him when I would turn in my keys, and he continued to assign me to rigs with broken internal AC units. He did stop being so much of a jerk, though. In turn, I made no more violent threats. 

*Relationship goals.*

It was a clear sign of how desperately management needed me that there was no retaliation for my confrontation. I’d literally assaulted my manager, broken his nose, and confirmed multiple times, point blank, that *I had no regrets―*and nothing. No punishment. No suspension. Not so much as a warning.

…Though I never did get that second raise I was offered. Guess you can’t trust what people promise you at knifepoint. 

For my first week back, management assigned me only short hauls. *Safe hauls,* if you will. They were usually saved for veteran employees with higher risk of lane-locking. 

It was like they were apologizing. Or maybe that they were afraid I’d fall apart if they let me stay on Route 333 for too long at once. Really, I was only falling apart when I *wasn’t* on it.

The most surprising result from the recent series of events, though, was how Randall actually began answering my questions. We’d talk over the radio as I drove.

“Who’s finding these impossibilities?” I asked one time. “Like hunting and caging them?”

“A few different organizations. Some private. Some government. They all know to reach out to companies like us, but I don’t actually know much about them. We only get involved when the impossibilities are contained.”

“So there’s other roads like Route 333?”

“A few. Not many.”

Another time, on an especially empty part of the desert, we talked nearly half an hour without breaking into screaming―our personal record.

“How come I could drive at normal speed with that crying thing in my trailer?” I asked. “If it’s lane-locked now, shouldn’t it have slowed me down too?”

“The road views things differently when they’re treated as cargo. Lane-locking only applies to the transporter.” Before I could respond, he continued. “*Don’t* ask about doing the same with humans. I know you’re about to. It wouldn’t work.”

“Why not? Has anybody actually *tried* putting humans in the back?”

“Here’s a tip to save both of us some time: assume some trucker before you has attempted any solution you can think up. However you carried Tiff, you’d go as slow as her. Trailer or front seat―it doesn’t matter where she’s sitting. She’d be a passenger not cargo. The road *knows* the difference.”

“How though?”

“Dunno. It can sniff intention, maybe? It knows that her and you are both the same species?”

“There has to be something truckers haven’t tried yet.”

“Nothing obvious.”

“And what happens if we do tell them before they lane-lock?” I asked. “What if we told Chris?”

“Have you ever heard of a driver named Douglas? He was marked for lane-locking, what was it, five years ago now? He noticed the signs before it happened, the ones we do tell you about. He quit. A week later a brand new driver, younger than you, lane-locked out of nowhere. She was the trade.”

“Was her name Autumn?”

A long pause.

“It was,” Randall said. With my short hauls, I still hadn't been able to visit her. “Look, let’s continue this tonight. We’ve been talking too long. There’s always a chance others are listening in.”

“Don’t they deserve to?”

In the distance, a dust devil rose up on the desert floor. Tumbleweeds bounced across the road.

“Really,” I pushed. “Maybe not everything. We don’t have to tell them about lane-locking for now, but they don’t even understand about impossibilities. Most of this is harmless. Why can't we tell them the basics?”

“You're free to.”

“I will.” 

“Will you?”

*Yes,* I nearly snapped back. *Of course.*

In my mind, I imagined it. Approaching the others in the break room and explaining what we were really doing on the road, about impossibilities and the things in the forest and why we should always carry a flashlight near dispatch.

I imagined the questions that would come after. 

More information always bred more questions. It had for me. It wouldn’t be long before they stumbled on the *right* questions, but didn’t they have a right to know? 

They would leave. Who wouldn’t? They’d leave, and another person would be marked by the road in their place. Something terrible would happen. Route 333 would retaliate.

It was the dilemma Randall and the others at dispatch had dealt with for years. I wanted to be better than them. I was actively trying to figure out a solution, but for the time being there was none. Did I let things be for now? Did I tell everyone, no matter the consequences?

“Maybe,” I told Randall.

When I made it back that night, I hesitated before I handed him my keys. “Send me on something longer.”

“Why?”

“Just do it.”

He did.

I went to visit Autumn.

The town she’d stayed in was much the same as I remembered from three weeks previous. A bustling farmer’s market was in full-swing at a nearby park. Vendors and fruit stands filled the grassy area, and parents clutched to the hands of their squirming children. Main Street featured instrument shops and stores lined with vintage records.

The first place I checked for Autumn was the motel―no use. The room she’d stayed in before was now vacant.

“Is there anywhere else to stay around here?” I asked a maid wheeling past me with a cart.

She wasn’t at the second motel either. I tried the rest stop where we’d showered after that, and even took a turn wandering through the farmer’s market. It was eerie watching families interact, knowing they weren’t quite real. Did they know? Were they aware they’d been wandering this same outside market for months? That their children never aged?

I’d arrived to Autumn’s town in the morning. By noon, I was preparing to head out. I did *still* have a job to do, and there were only so many places I could check. Besides, I’d pass back through on the way home.

I was just exiting the doors of *Café Linda* after a brief pit stop when I heard it. A scream. I tossed my cup to the ground (not a big deal. The coffee was yet again terrible) and rushed the direction of the noise.

It came again. 

“Autumn!” I shouted.

 I skittered to a stop at the edge of an alleyway. The scream. The noise. It had come from beyond.

*A trick*. I knew this. Already, one of these things had impersonated Myra and another, Randall. One was merely doing it again. I’d be a fool if I really believed this was Autumn, however terrified the voice seemed. It was effective. Even knowing what I did, I was tempted to go down the alley. I *needed* to know if it was the real her.

A third shriek.

“Autumn!” It escaped my lips involuntarily.

“Stay back!” she shouted. “Don’t come!”

It was all the encouragement I needed to hurl myself down the side street toward her.



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



But first.

Before we get into all that pesky, exciting action, let’s do something I’m *sure* you all love. 

Let’s pause.

She didn’t explain this all to me until much later that day, but before we proceed, there's some things you should know about Autumn. 



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



She did try college. Really, she did. The structure of it all just wasn’t for her. She tried hair school next (big mistake), then electrician work, then eventually, when she’d begun and dropped out of training for half a dozen different trades, she responded to an online advert for a nearby trucking company. It was more out of curiosity than anything. Surely, they couldn’t *actually* pay as much as they purported to.

They did.

Finally, she’d found something she didn’t loathe, that didn’t confine her mind to a monotonous box of monotonous details―what bleach to use on what shade of hair, what wire connected where. In fact, it didn’t confine her mind at all. That was the beauty of it. She could drive, in a trance, and she could think about the things she *wanted* to think about. Autumn wasn’t dumb; she learned quickly. The problem was merely trying to focus on things other people told her to focus on. 

For one year, she hauled on Route 333. Logically, she could drive it for another decade, maybe two. She was new. The road was still short to her. Others were driving on versions of Route 333 four times the length as hers, and they would still drive for years more. She went on the longer hauls that management assigned her to. Shorter hauls were for veteran truckers, not her. She didn’t need to worry. Not yet.

Then she lane-locked. 

It came suddenly. Without the usual warning signs. She’d been coming back from a longer haul at the time, further out than drivers typically lane-locked. Even young as she was, there weren’t enough years in her life to make it back. She drove anyway. 

For months, other truckers would visit her on their trips. They’d stop and talk or bring her things from the outside world (Coke, for example, simply didn’t taste the same from road gas stations). 

At first, it was bearable. Sometimes, for days, she would travel through pockets of space no one could follow her into, but even then there was the radio. She would chat for hours with her former co-workers. She stayed connected.

Her radio broke.

That in and of itself wasn’t a tragedy. It was weeks before she and another trucker crossed paths, but she *did* get another one. The real tragedy was the corrosion of a habit. The others had already gotten used to not talking with her. The memory of her was fading.

Her co-workers swapped out. Some died. Some found safer jobs. Some merely quit. Turnover had always been high. They didn’t stay just because she did, and those who *did* stay long term were running shorter hauls. They weren’t coming out as far as her. 

Visits slowed. 

They stopped.

Her radio broke again. No one brought her a new one.

Autumn had driven three years with communication to other drivers. She drove two more without it. Alone. 

No one remembered her. Those who did stopped caring. She was an uncomfortable reminder of what was to come. Better to push her to the back of the fridge and stock fresher produce to put in front.

Still, she drove.

What else was there to do?

She told herself it was determination. Grit. Convicts would live for thirty years in confinement and still manage to make a life for themselves once they got out; hope existed.

Except she wouldn’t get out. This was a life sentence. She wasn’t *delusional*, after all.

Or was she? Why did she continue to drive when she knew she was driving for a goal she would never reach?

Autumn wished she could stop.

She wished it would end.

She wished she’d stayed in college.

One day, on a long desert road, clouds had rolled in. Thick dark droplets of blood pooled on the hood of her rig. Her truck groaned, as if something was exerting pressure inwards. She’d heard of this. Other truckers said this was what happened when the road *noticed* you. Perhaps, finally, after these years, it was noticing her. It would grant her the blessing she was too deluded to grant herself: the ability to stop driving.

She was ready.

And then. Through the storm. Another truck appeared. Beyond all reason, superseding all logic, Autumn fled to it, got inside, met the driver, directed him to a town.

For the first time in years, she spoke with a real, actual human who wasn’t constructed by the road. A seed she thought had dried out long ago cracked open. A leaf pushed up through the dirt. 

*Oh yes,* she thought. *This is what it felt like to be alive.*

He had to go. She’d already known that, but he would be back. *Within the week,* he promised. Autumn bid him farewell and marked her calendar for his return, her one final connection to the real world. 

She waited a week.

She waited another.

She stopped waiting.

The sprout died, this time for real. Seeds can survive so much. It’s only when they open into plants they become fragile, vulnerable things. When Autumn woke in the mornings, in the seconds before she remembered where she was, she would reach for her keys. She would remember then that her vehicle was gone, crushed. She could no longer drive. She could no longer do…well, anything*.*

*I’m back*, a voice told her one day from a forbidden alleyway. *Me. Brendon.*

It wasn’t him. She knew that. You didn’t survive five years on the road without knowing that, and neither did the creature think she believed it. Perhaps it was only pretending out of the sheer habit. 

It didn’t really matter why.

There *had* been a point to driving after all. It had been a futile, empty purpose, but it had still been a purpose. Before, the future had stretched out like an empty highway. Now it opened like the blank chasm beyond a cliff.

*Come,* the thing in the alley had said.

*Alright then,* she’d told it. *Alright.*

And she’d gone.



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



At the time, I didn't know any of that. All I knew was that Autumn was screaming. 

The moment I crossed into the alley, the world changed. 

The temperature around me lowered a dozen degrees. My breath plumed outward in a cloud of steam. The brick walls turned flaky, like they were amateur paper mache creations made for the set of a theater production. The sky flickered―no, not flickered. *Throbbed*. Pulsing veins and arteries crisscrossed it.

Wherever I was, it wasn’t Route 333.

I sprinted past the edge of the alley, and the town immediately ended. Behind me, the buildings were hollow things, walls and roofs but no back walls. Through their windows filtered daylight from the Route 333 sun. Even the coffee shop I'd just come from was now the empty, movie-set version of a building, real only on the front side.

Before me lay a flat, gray landscape. Where I stepped, water rippled outwards, though my socks stayed dry. The only distinguishing feature were the bones of a house some distance off. No walls. Just a roof and support beams. Inside was a table.

On that table was Autumn.

“Brendon, no! I told you to stay away.”

She was pinned down. By what I couldn’t tell. Two creatures sat on either ends of the table, forks in hand. As I approached, their heads twisted unnaturally to face me―not their torsos, just the heads. One looked exactly like Gloria. 

The other was me. 

“Sit.” The not-Me pulled out a chair. It made no move to attack.

“I’m good, thanks.”

“If you refuse our hospitality, then depart. You were not invited here.”

“It’s a trick,” Autumn said. “Don’t try to leave. They can’t trade you if you stay willingly, and they won’t risk hurting you. They need―”

The not-Gloria shoved its hand into her mouth to silence her, like *directly* in her mouth. Autumn’s back arched and her head twisted back and forth, but she couldn’t dislodge it. Eventually, she stopped struggling and inhaled through her nostrils. The not-Gloria sat back down. It left its hand shoved in her mouth.

*Don’t leave, huh?*

“You things are the hitchhikers, aren't you?” I asked. 

They stayed silent, gripping their forks.

“No,” I said. “Not quite. The hitchhikers are on Route 333, trying to get off. You’re trying to get on, is that right? Why?”

“We can't get off until we've gotten on,” not-Me said.

 “You’ve interrupted our feasting,” not-Gloria hissed. “Leave us in peace.”

“All yours.” I took a seat. I waited.

It would be easy to assume that’s what they wanted with us: to eat us. That’s what scary monsters wanted in tales over campfires after all. Perhaps all these two creatures wanted was some quiet to feed on Autumn. I’d gotten lucky before. Why couldn’t I just assume I’d gotten lucky again and arrived the second before they ripped her to shreds? 

And yet…

This house, this table, this entire setup―it was all so like the rest of this place. A staged theater production. They’d been waiting for me.

“Go on then,” I said.

“You’re just going to let us eat her?” not-Me asked.

“She was kind of annoying anyway.”

They looked at each other.

“Very well,” not-Gloria said. She raised her fork, looking very much like a human convincing themselves that, *I guess I’m doing this. I’m really eating a person. Don’t think about it. Don’t think about it. Perhaps people taste like pork.*

“Don’t try to save her,” said not-Me.

“Wouldn’t dream of it.”

“Really,” said not-Gloria. “Don’t.”

They waited (for me to save her, I presume). I nodded encouragingly.

Not-Gloria lowered the fork.

“This is your whole thing then?” I asked. “You lure us here, and then you try and get us to leave again? So you can what? Trade us for what?”

Not-Me only stared.

“Well?” I demanded.

It sighed. It gestured at its companion, who removed their hand from Autumn’s mouth.

She spit. “I wouldn’t leave, so they were using me as bait. We have to want to leave or the road won’t let them trade us. They want passage to Route 333.”

“I told you last time,” I said. “You’ll have to pretend more convincingly if you want to fool us.”

Not-Me sneered. “We have already fooled you into crossing over. You’re human. You have to leave eventually. You can’t survive here forever.”

“Fine. So we die either way. Something tells me it’s still better to choose the option that doesn't involve helping you.” 

“We only need one of you,” said not-Gloria.

For the first time, that gave me pause. If they really only did need one of us that meant the other still had a chance at surviving.

I stood.

“I’m taking her,” I said. “She’s not leaving by her own choice, got it? No tradsies. Once I’ve put her back on the road, I’ll decide what to do with myself, but not before then.”

They said nothing, but they didn’t try to stop me as I struggled to unfasten the ropes holding Autumn down. After a minute of unsuccessfully tugging at a hand-restraint, not-Gloria scoffed. She pinched at the rope, and it tore apart as easily as string cheese. These things might not have a taste for human flesh, but they would still have no difficulty killing us.

They trailed behind me as I carried Autumn, feet still tied, towards the alley. It was telling of how long she’d been here that she didn’t fight me carrying her. Her breathing was heavy. She exuded fatigue. How long had it been since she’d eaten?

“What are you doing?” she whispered between breaths.

“Trust me.”

When I reached the boundary, I set her down and pushed her across with my foot. On the other side, she struggled into a sit.

“Now you,” not-Gloria said.

“No.”

“That was the deal.”

“We made no deal. I’m staying.” What would happen if I tried to leave? Would I turn to dust the moment I stepped across? Switch bodies with one of them? “I’ll starve on this side if I have to, but I’m not going.”

“We can still hurt you, stone-dweller,” not-Me said. “Torture. Blood-letting. Show you things you can’t unsee. Just ask the girl. You’ll wish you left when you had the chance.”

I took a breath and reached for the thing tucked into the lining of my pants. “You want me to leave so bad? Make me.”

I lunged.

It’s an odd sensation, stabbing your own face with a dinner fork. In a way, I think it made it easier. I wasn’t aiming for anything particular besides the general facial area, but I got lucky. The fork lodged in the creature’s throat and sunk deep. 

Not-Me might have been stronger than the real me, but I still had surprise on my side. I shoved my wide-eyed doppelganger against the wall and, like any surprised person would do in such a situation, it shoved me back. It withheld none of its strength.

I was hurled backwards. The air left me even before I slammed into the ground―the ground on the side of Route 333.

“*Deceit! Trickery!*” 

Not-Me ripped the fork from its neck. Black ichor spurted out. Then he and not-Gloria threw themselves at us but slammed into an invisible barrier.

I coughed and clutched my chest. *A couple broken ribs for sure.* 

I raised my hand at the shrieking creatures. “Thanks for the help.”



**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**



At first, they’d tried to trick her into leaving. That’s what Autumn told me. She wouldn’t though. She told them to do whatever terrible things they would to her. They’d decided to use her as bait instead.

Autumn explained that and everything else about her past to me as we swung our legs over the edge of a rickety bridge at the edge of town. She was still weak, but feeling stronger after eating for the first time in three days. The sun had risen and fallen, and day was turning to evening. Beneath us, enormous dark shapes moved through the water, occasionally pulsing with a bioluminescent, glowing green.

“What are they?” I’d asked Autumn.

“Jump in and find out.”

A cool evening breeze tickled the hairs on the back of my neck. 

She’d gone intentionally. She’d walked onto the side street knowing something terrible would happen.

“Autumn, I’m―”

“Don’t,” she said. “Don’t tell me you’re sorry. I don’t want your pity. I’m sick of pity. You should have come back sooner, but that doesn’t mean I should have thrown myself at something with teeth and claws. Just don’t―don’t think of me like something that needs to be coddled.”

“I don’t.”

“You say that, but people can’t help who they feel sorry for.”

I blew out through my mouth and tossed a pebble at the river below. Something thick and tongue-like lashed out for it.

“You weren’t the only one,” I said. “In the middle of that storm…well you saw me. I was like you, except I really had given up. I was just waiting. You save me. I save you.”

She tossed her own pebble. Multiple of the tentacle things fought for it. “This road’s really done a number on us, hasn’t it?”

“Not the road. For me, it’s just…life.” I snapped my fingers. “Before this job, my future was the openness beyond a cliff. Now, it’s a highway.”

“That’s my line. And you butchered it.”

I laughed.

For a while, we just sat in silence.

“They know,” I said. “The shape-shifter things. I still don’t understand the whole thing with us needing to ‘try to leave,’ but it all feels too close to lane-locking. Randall explained to me a few days ago how cargo rules work. Otherwise, we couldn’t transport living things. This just feels too similar.”

“So?”

“So they could have the answer. They might know how to get[ you out](https://www.reddit.com/r/lucasGandola/comments/1lklmnq/welcome/).”
