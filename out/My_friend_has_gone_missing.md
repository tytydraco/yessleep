My friend was a cool soul and a light-hearted person. She loved nature, especially soil and plants. Her main forte was to study about it more. Glinda and I were best friends.



It all started at a camp where her focus was not partying or campfire, It was a lady. Every night we went to sleep in our tent. She talked about the lady she felt spoke to and said “She only comes to me. When you are not there”. 



“Why does your other friend don't wanna talk to me?” I always asked her.



“I don't know, I guess I match her vibes” she replied.



I always had an unassured face. As soon as we left that camp. She wanted to learn about soil and plants. She texted me that she had been selected by a university which was in Nevada, forest area.

She was very excited about it. Although I was a little unsure about her decision, anyway I supported her. 



We used to video call every time. Until one day. I video-called her. The phone got picked up and I was about to say hello but the screen was blank and it was all black. All black background. A slight figure was there on the call in the corner of the screen. As if a face. Kind of smiling. But I can't be assured about that. I got disturbed.



 I said “hello”. No one answered and I cut the call thinking it was a network issue, but it wasn't. I ranged her again. She picked up the call, and now her face was brightly visible. 

I asked her who was on the call before. The answer gave me the chills.



She said it was her friend from the camp. 



I asked, “What is she doing there”?.



She replied, “She came to visit me”.



“In Nevada” I was shocked.



“Yeah”



“Then, why didn't she show her face to me,” I asked.



She said, “Because she is shy”.



Oh, and I said, “Okay enjoy with her”.



She was smiling and her smile was bigger than most of her smile. “See you again” and I cut the call.

And the next day her mother called me. She was tensed and she asked me if I got her call, I said “Yeah, last night before I slept”

She said her hostel warden had called her and told her how she had been missing from the night. I was shocked, then I called her. It was going straight to her voice. Then I saw a message from her on my phone which was sent to me after I slept. It said



“You are the best, and you are the only good friend I have don't worry about me, I will always be in your heart”



After a while, the police got involved. I showed them the video call which was automatically recorded and the message. It had been 32 hours now.



All I could conclude was the “FREIND” she was talking about.



The police found a bag in her hostel. It was in the shaft and when they opened the bag.

It was a hand, just a hand with no body, the moment I saw it. I knew it wasn't of my friend, she is brown and the hand was way pale.



It relieved me, but what was she doing in Nevada? Who was her friend I don't have answers.

I am going to find out about it.

I am going, to Nevada

Wait for part 2.
