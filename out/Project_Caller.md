Hello, my name is Connor, I'm twenty-six years old. Just to be clear, I'm a nobody, I may be a somebody to some, mainly my parents. But other than that, I am your average joe. If you are reading this, it's not for attention, but only to see that I am not the only one going through such an ordeal as this.

 

I just got home from work, as you guess, I was tired. I work for a shady business that pays well by the hour just by me answering calls from customers and redirecting them to whoever can answer their questions.

 

Of course there was calls from disgruntled people that lacked the understanding that I was only doing my job, and demanding to receive a refund for whatever product that they had.

 

Let's get back to me, as you have an interest in what has changed my life so much, that no amount of therapy and illegal recreational activities will ever put my mind at ease.

 

I was in my room, with the TV on, trying to figure out how to get this wretched pieces of crap of a remote to connect back to the TV so I can watch that damn movie, that is now on demand. My phone rang, which I was relieved to have an excuse to focus on something else.

 

I picked up the phone, looking at the caller ID. Making sure it wasn't a telemarketer trying to sell me some useless product . But you can probably imagine the shock and confusion that covered my face when I saw that it was my own number, calling me.

 

A part of me told me not to even answer, which if I could undo now, I wouldn't even be sharing this. But of course, the curiosity in me won over my defensive side, and just like those idiots in those horror movie, I answered.

 

I held the phone to my ear, listening intently for a sound, and then.... I hear it "Connor...." It's voice was a rasp, as if it struggled to get the word out. I flinched as it said my name, and it hit me. That this thing or person, was calling from my number.

 

"Who is this? How do you know my name?" I frantically spoke, hoping to get answers from it. But to no avail, it only repeated itself. This time, using a different voice... It was my Mom's. "Connor darling, where are you?" I froze, my mother never called me darling, nonetheless darling.

 

I hung up on the thing impersonating my mother, hoping it would just leave me alone. So I could focus on the remote that I was messing with moments earlier.

 

I rationalized that the caller was someone just trying to pull some prank on me, trying to scare me. But it didn't explain how they were using my own number, or impersonated my Mom's voice so perfectly.

 

I decided to call my Mom, just in case... no, don't think like that I told myself. I'm just calling to calm me down. Hopefully she will.

 

I dialed her number from my contacts, after I hit the call button, it rang twice be fore being answered. "Oh, hey Connie, now's not at good time. But I would love to have you over at my place" I should have been relieved, but I noticed the faint rasp that was in her voice. No, I told myself, it's just my imagination.

"Yeah, sure.... what for?" I asked. Last time I was at her place, she went on and on about how her neighbors turn on music at six in the morning. But I listened politely to her. As she and my Dad were divorced and still has a hard time understanding that it's not her fault. Just that it was his lack of communication.

 

"I want to show you something, it's for you to have, and to see... Trust me Connie" That rasp was there, but again I pushed it off telling myself that I was paranoid. We hung up, I went to bed. I never got that remote to connect.

 

The next day started with my morning routine, going to work and redirecting calls. When my shift was over, I drove to my Mom's house. I expected to see my Mom standing outside her house. But instead, the front door war slight ajar. I parked my 2016 Jeep Cherokee in her driveway. Putting my phone in my pocket, turned off the ignition and stepped out.

 

I knocked on the door, just in case if she was in middle of something. It was unlike her no to answer, especially if she was expecting me.

 

I knocked again, this time I was worried. But then I smelled the very distinct stench of... decay.

I pushed open the door, and I saw her... at least what was in front of me. Her body deprived of all color and life, was on the floor.

 

I pulled my phone out, fumbling with the emergency number and pressed dial. The operators voice was clear, no rasp. "911, what's your emergency?"

 

"My Mom's dead. She..." I then noticed that her throat was torn open. Blood had dried up around her on the hardwood floors. Her head was also open... but whoever did it took their time to make the cuts in her skull, I didn't dare to look inside the hollowed skull.

 

The operator's voice brought me out of my trance. "Sir, stay calm, Help in on the way. What is your address and tell me what you see.

I told the operator everything. She told me I had to get out of the house immediately. Which when I did, They arrived.

 

They weren't police, it was the military. I stood and watched. They ran in with guns ready to fire. A couple moments later, Ii heard them shooting something.

Another car pulled up shortly after the gunfire stopped.

 

I asked nobody in particular, what the hell is going on. My questions were soon answered by the men in black. Later on, I was interviewed about that happened, I told them my side of the story. Nodding their head as they took notes as I talked.

 

Then they told me, that test subject, part of an experiment called "Project: Caller". I can't say much more. As you can probably guess, they made me sign a confidentiality form. As the men in black told me I was already lucky to still be alive, and that the subject was dead.

 

I went home later that night. As you can probably guess, my door... was opened ever so slightly. I heard my Mom's voice, that rasp was ever so clear.

"Connie, how was your day?"
