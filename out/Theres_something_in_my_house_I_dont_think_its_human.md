The day this happened it was a normal day. Nothing was out of the ordinary in fact it was quite a nice day. The sun was shining and the birds were chirping. But that all changed after sundown. It was around 7:00pm, I was making dinner with headphones in blasting music. 

Then I heard it, someone whispered my name clear as day. I whipped my head around in shock mostly because there would’ve been no one there to say my name because I lived alone and the song I was listening to didn’t say my name either. 

I ruled it off as my mind playing tricks on me because there was no way I would be able to hear someone with my headphones on. But for some reason I still felt disturbed. I took out my headphones and listened again to see if it was my mind playing tricks on me. I heard nothing so I continued the rest of my night normally. 

I was in the shower when I heard a loud crash in the room next to mine. I immediately got out of the shower and put a robe on. I rushed out of the bathroom into the room next door. I flung the door open but to my shock nothing had fallen. All I saw was my cat huddled in a corner. 

“It’s ok Daisy..everything is alright.” I said petting my cat. I was even more unsettled because my cat normally never freaks out like that. I knew something was wrong. 

I picked up my cat and brought her into my room while i got dressed. Forget my shower I was too freaked out. I just decided to go to sleep ruling it off as me being paranoid. I layed in bed darting my eyes around. After a while I got tired and  drifted off to sleep. 

I woke up to a scream downstairs. “What the fuck?!” I shouted as I looked at the clock. It read 3:00am, if I wasn’t scared before I went to sleep I definitely was now. I looked for my cat. I saw her in my closet cowering behind a shoe box. I decided I was going to end this and go see what was going on. 

But as soon as I left my bedroom a high pitched voice screamed my name over and over. I suddenly felt like I was being watched, I rushed into my hallway closet and I slammed the door closed. 

I stayed in there for what felt like forever until I heard my cat shriek in pain. My body moved before I could even think. I rushed to where I heard my cat and there it was. 

The creature was so tall it had to bend to fit under my roof. It had giant black pits for eyes, and its teeth it had rows and rows of teeth. Then I looked in the creatures hand to see my cat. She was motionless and red stained her white fur. I screamed and ran away at full speed. I ran into my room and closed the room. I crawled under the bed. I heard my door crash open. It found me. 

I’m pressing send as a last minute attempt to get this story to people everywhere. My WiFi is cutting out. I’m not sure it it’s the monsters doing or not. I don’t know what this monster is going to do to me. But I do know one thing, I won’t be alive for much longer.
