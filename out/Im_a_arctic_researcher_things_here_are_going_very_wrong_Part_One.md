I work as an Arctic researcher in the North Canada area, the Canadian Arctic to be simple. Me and my coworkers are in a newer arctic research base, that I will not name for privacy. I’m writing this as a story on what happened there. Everything was fine until that damned blizzard rolled in. I apologize for my writing, as I'm by no means a writer, the only writing I do normally is my research notes or emails. To start off I’ll tell you a little about myself. My name is John, I’ve always kinda had a dream of working at the Arctic especially after watching The Thing in my teens. At the beginning of my later years of highschool I decided to try and do it. I eventually got a PhD in Ecology at Stanford, thankfully with a scholarship. I got my PhD in 2017 and as soon as I could I tried to get a job in Arctic research. Most of the ones I found were either full not needing an extra or already shipped out at their respective base, that was until I found one at a newly constructed base. They hadn’t left yet and thankfully needed an ecologist. This company is called Rudsys Science. I’ve worked with the company since, usually with the same group.

Now usually we stay for a few months then leave, swapping out with another, but due to harsher weather than expected, we were forced to stay for longer. Then our worst fears became true; we had to prepare for a blizzard. Unlike a normal blizzard, which lasted a few hours, this one was meant to last 4 days. That has you up to date on everything that has happened leading up to 3 days. 

3 days ago was a pretty beautiful morning all things considered, the air cold as ice when breathing in and still. I woke up later than everyone, around 9 AM, my damn alarm was broken again. When I woke up I saw out my window the giant blizzard making its way over towards us, slowly moving like a white leviathan across the snowy ground. Groggy as ever I forced myself out of bed and out to the dining area. When I walked in I saw everyone was already eating breakfast. The breakfast that day was tomato soup that had the strange smell of a warm sweet and sour expired ketchup, coffee, bread, and eggs. At the table on the left most side, Jamie and Wyatt, our biologist and radiologist, joking and laughing away trying to ease the tension in their minds. At the table to the right most side, Garret and Olivier, our heavy equipment technician and geologist, looking more worried but still talking vibrantly.

I went and sat alone without breakfast; I wasn’t really hungry (especially after smelling the soup), and even after knowing these guys for years and being good friends with them, I preferred to be alone. It gives me time to think and rest, as we've been preparing for a couple of days at that point. I’ve always been that way.

“You see the storm? It was huge, way bigger than average out here,” Garret said, leaning back in his chair. 

Garret was a built and burly man, looking like he’d be a great linebacker. Taller than average, bald with a dark brown beard, he looks mean and angry, but he is a giant teddy bear. He talks with an upper midwest accent, from a state I can’t personally pinpoint. 

“It’ll bury us if we let it,” Garret leaned forward while stretching.

Olivier continues what Garret was saying at first, “It is the biggest storm I've seen, that's for sure; to be honest, I'm a little scared of it.” 

Olivier was from Quebec with a subtle French accent; he was the only non-American on the base. Olivier was short, about 5’5, with blonde hair and newly shaven stubble. 

“It’ll take days after it to even think about getting out of here,” Olivier shook his head in dismay.

“It’ll be fine; it isn’t the first blizzard we’ve been through. It won’t come snatch you in the night, dude,” Jamie said, a chuckle leaving his lips at the end.

 

Jamie was a pretty average guy. He had an average build, though a little on the way to skinny side, and average height. He was unable to grow facial hair despite his best efforts. His black curly hair shined with water, obviously just being washed not long ago. His glasses desperately needed to be cleaned. He had a SoCal accent.

“I understand the concerns myself. I'm having piss-poor luck trying to contact the outside due to it. We’re cut off,” Wyatt said, all the laughter and joking sucked out of him.

Wyatt was a quiet guy like me, but he was the life of the party if he spoke up. He had a long curly, dirty blonde mullet and a 70’s mustache. He wore a hat everywhere; you’d never see him without it. Wyatt came from Georgia, but even though he lived there his whole life, he had only a little bit of a Georgia accent.

Wyatt sat up and left, saying he was going to go to the radio room. “I'm going to try one more time, see if it works.”

After the news, the room felt dreary and oppressive, but we had work to do. Jamie and Olivier were next to leave, then Garret, and I was last. As I walked out, I checked the storm; it was closer, almost atop us; it would roll in by the hour. I went to the office area and finished up my notes. My work has been done for a while as we were meant to leave 2 months ago, now all I have to do is help around. By the time I was done fixing up notes the storm had finally covered us, the darkness outside dark white, snow and wind flying past beating the window. I got up to leave the office area and before I could reach the door it opened.

“Hell John, are you still in here? I thought your job was done,” Jamie said, us both jump scared by each other, “Garret and Wyatt need help lifting stuff. They need an extra hand, I'm too weak and Olivier is busy.”

Jamie looked sickly and gaunt. He was sweating, even with the cool air. His eyes darted everywhere, but mainly at the door outside and out the window.

“My job is, I was just finishing notes. But okay, I'll go help them,” I had said, walking past him squeezing by. 

I walked down the hallways till I found the duo. Garret and Wyatt are lifting a crate and need a third, god knows why it was so heavy. 

“This is the first time I’ve seen Garret not lift something himself, and Wyatt, were you able to reach the outside,” I said, I slipped in between them to help lift.

“Nope, nothing went through. I changed radio signals, frequencies, everything and I got nothing,” Wyatt said as we pushed the crate up onto the shelf. 

Eventually we did get it, afterwards we just did a few chores till it was 9. I was tired, I usually am by this time. So I went to bed, much to Garret’s dismay (he really wanted to play scrabble with everyone). As I walked to my room I saw Jamie, he was going to bed as well. I entered my room, the snow hounding my window. I lay in my bed and tried to sleep. I woke up around 2 in the morning to the loud shuffle of feet as it walked past my room, a murmuring came with it. I got up to check it out. As I opened my door the shuffle stopped, and as I peered my head out the person had turned around, it was Jamie. He looked half asleep if he wasn’t just asleep, he was slightly hunched over with his arms bent inwards like that of a zombie from a movie, and his legs were bent as if he was meant to be taller than his legs would let him. 

“Jamie? You okay man, why are you up so late,” I said as I walked ever closer to him. 

“The thing outside wants me, it wants everyone. It's in my every waking thought since the storm hit us,” Jamie said as he turned around and kept walking.

“Guys wake up! Jamie is delirious and going outside,” I yelled, hopefully waking someone.

I ran after him as he walked outside, he opened the door with a force I never knew he had. He was out in the snow with only a shirt and pants on, he’d die out there. When I ran out the door I saw him collapse on his knees, never looking away from the far reaches of the storm in front of him. In one swift motion Jamie was grabbed by something, pulled away from the light and visibility of the base at lightning speeds, he was grabbed and pulled in such a way his body was crumpled, his back breaking inwards bending him at an odd angle. If you ever heard of the Byford Dolphin Incident. That's how I imagine the man who was in front of the airlock's body looked as he was sucked through it. Jamie looked how I imagined that man looked. Garret ran outside just before it happened, putting on a coat. 

“What the hell was that? What the hell! We need to find him,” Garret went and grabbed a flashlight giving me one while he himself had one.

Wyatt groggily walked out his room, seeing what we were doing and ran to do the same. When we were ready all 3 of us ran outside looking for Jamie, calling for him. The search lasted about 25 minutes, it ended when I found what we could of him. His upper gums and part of his scalp, with other unidentifiable parts of the human body. The rest of the night was a blur, a part that I simply can’t remember, except one moment. When I was in my room in the later hours of the night, Wyatt and Garret outside my room discussing what could have done what we saw, I saw it. A roughly eight foot tall dark silhouette, it was humanoid, with long legs and arms, a broad upper body but a starved lower body, and a head that looked like it was elongated at the mouth, like whatever it was had a plague doctor mask on. Only reason I saw so much of it was that it seemed to purposely be right on the edge of visibility. It was carrying something, it didn’t take too much of an imagination to know what it was carrying. Now I'm not a superstitious person, but what I saw was real, very real.

When I saw it I walked out of my room, needing to tell the others. But when I walked out I held my tongue and just said.

“We can speculate when the sun rises, maybe we will find Jamie’s remains,” I said, unable to tell them what I saw, either out of fear or to seem sane.
