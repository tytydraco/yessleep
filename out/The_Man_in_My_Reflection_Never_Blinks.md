  In my apartment I barely paid attention to the bathroom mirror. The place was old and cheap, and I was too broke to be picky. The mirror was like everything else, stained, slightly warped, and permanently fogged in the corners. I only glanced at it in passing, never giving it much thought. Until the night I realized my reflection wasn’t blinking. It happened while I was brushing my teeth. I had been staring absentmindedly at my reflection when a strange feeling crept over me. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t place what. Then it hit me. I blinked. My reflection didn’t.

  I froze, toothbrush clutched in my hand. My eyes were burning from how long I had been staring, so I forced another blink, slow and deliberate. The man in the mirror held my gaze, his eyes wide and unblinking. I let out a nervous laugh, shaking my head. Maybe I had just imagined it. Maybe I was overtired, or the mirror was old enough to have some weird warping effect. It was an illusion, nothing more. That’s what I told myself.

  Over the next few days, I started to notice other things. Subtle at first. The tiniest delay in my reflection’s movements. A hesitation before it matched my expression. A flicker, like a buffering video, before it snapped into place. And then, one night, it smiled at me. I wasn’t smiling. The change was so small, so fleeting, that I almost convinced myself it hadn’t happened. But deep down, I knew better. Something was wrong with the mirror. 

  I started avoiding it. I’d brush my teeth quickly, keeping my eyes down. I’d shower with the door open, towel draped over the glass to block my view. But no matter how much I ignored it, the feeling of being watched never faded.

  Last night, everything changed. I woke around 3 AM, my throat dry, my body aching with exhaustion. Without thinking, I stumbled into the bathroom and flicked on the light. And I looked. I shouldn’t have looked. Because my reflection was already staring at me. It wasn’t mirroring my sleepy confusion. It wasn’t matching my sluggish movements. It was grinning. A slow, creeping smile stretched too wide across its face. And then, as I stood there, frozen, it blinked. But not normally. One eye. Then the other. A cold wave of nausea rolled through me. My breath hitched. My hands clenched the sink so hard my knuckles went white.

  My reflection took a step forward. I flipped the light switch off and ran. I don’t remember getting back into bed, only the sheer terror that kept me awake until morning. When I finally worked up the courage to check the bathroom, the mirror was empty. Not shattered. Not removed. Just empty. The sink, the tiled walls, the shower curtain, everything reflected perfectly. But I wasn’t there.

  Then I heard it. A slow, wet footstep behind me. And another. And another. I didn’t turn around. I couldn’t. My body was locked in place, every nerve screaming at me to run, but something in the air, something thick, heavy, wrong, kept me frozen. My breath came in short, shallow bursts, my pulse pounding in my ears. The floor creaked. Whatever was behind me was getting closer.

  I squeezed my eyes shut. If I didn’t look, maybe it wouldn’t be real. Maybe I’d wake up in my bed, and this would all be some fever dream. A long, slow exhale ghosted against the back of my neck. Not mine. The air around me felt colder, suffocating, like the walls were closing in. Then, a whisper. So close it could have been inside my own head.

“You let me out.”

  The lights flickered. The air smelled damp and rotten, like wood left to decay in a basement. I opened my eyes, and against every instinct, I turned around. There was nothing there. But in the mirror my reflection was back. Only now, it wasn’t mimicking me. It stood still, watching, as I slowly backed away. Then, just before I turned to run, it raised one hand. And waved.

  Before I understood what was happening, an invisible force, something pulling at me, dragging me toward the mirror. Every instinct in my body screamed at me to fight, to resist. I dug my heels into the floor, twisting, thrashing, forcing my body to break free from the invisible grip. My fingers, which had already begun to press against the glass, curled into a fist. And I punched the mirror. Glass exploded in all directions, shards cutting into my skin, a sound like shrieking metal tearing through the air. The pull stopped.I hit the floor, gasping, hands shaking as I scrambled backward, away from the shattered remains of the mirror.

  For a moment, nothing happened. Then, from within the broken pieces, something moved.  A pale hand reached out from the largest shard, fingers stretching, twisting, grasping at empty air. My face, but wrong, warped with rage, its mouth stretched wide in a silent scream. Then, piece by piece, the shards went dark. Like ink spilling over a canvas, the reflection faded into nothing, swallowed by an emptiness that made my stomach turn. And then it was gone. The room was silent, the mirror was shattered, and I was still here.

  I sat there for hours, waiting, trembling, staring at the pieces, expecting something or anything to come crawling out. But nothing did. I didn’t sleep that night, I haven’t slept since. I threw away every mirror in my apartment. Any reflective surface, I covered. My phone, my laptop screen, even the shine of my doorknob. I avoid them all. Because I know it’s still out there. Waiting and Watching. And sometimes, in the corner of my vision, in a place where my reflection should be, 

I see nothing at all.
