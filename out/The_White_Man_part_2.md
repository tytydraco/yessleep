If you want to read about the event that brought him into my life: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/3unOAEn2Ep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/3unOAEn2Ep)

My dad was poor. Like we lived and a trailer and had food stamps poor. I had good grades, but I also had to work if I wanted anything like a phone, school clothes, or my own snack. When I wasn't at school or work, I was almost always with some friend, usually Mel.

Since I was always occupied by something, it took about two weeks for me to notice it. Everywhere I went, I would see a paper white face, maybe three feet off the ground. It was always far away. So far I couldn't make out the face. I was used to seeing things. I had "friends" and "monsters" everywhere. But this is the first time I consistently saw the same thing in different places.

I tried to ignore it. Being that far away there was no way it could hurt me. Sometimes I pushed it so far to the back of my mind I would completely forget about it. Then I'd wake up, go to school, and see him poking around the corner of the hallway. Wherever we went, nobody seemed to notice him, but even in crowded places they would walk around him.

The more I saw him, the more worried I would get. I didn't notice at the time, but if I ignored him, he would stay back and watch. If I stared at him, or thought about him too much, he would be closer the next time I saw him, still always behind something.

One night I went out running because I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep. I did a giant loop, and as I was coming back, I saw him hiding behind the car. I had to walk around him to get inside.

I stood frozen in place. I could see his face now. His head was a little larger than I thought. It didn't look right. His skin was paper white. His head was long, but the sides were squished together, making it more narrow than any I have seen. A hairless head with lumps underneath. Almost like you could see the different plates that made up his skull. You could see black veins underneath the skin. Skin that looked so tight it could tear at any moment. Sharp, prominent cheekbones. His eyes were gone. Just black holes. There was something dried around them. Not quite black, but still dark. His mouth was a tight smile. Surprisingly normal teeth.

I truly do not know how long I stood there staring at him. When I finally got the courage to move, I started walking towards the house. He moved with me. Always keeping his body hidden. Still watching.

When I went inside I ran to my dad crying. I told him that I really needed to talk to him but it wasn't safe here. We couldn't talk about it in the house.

He sighed and put on his shoes. We went for a walk and I told him about the guy, looking everywhere the whole time because I couldn't see it anymore.

When I finally stopped talking, we had made it back home. Dad kept his voice concerned, but he basically told me it was all in my head. He went to his room and came back out with a wooden box.

He handed it to me, saying it was his grandfather's and it might give me some comfort. It was a beautiful wooden box with a cross etched into it. Inside, there was a Bible, some notes and letters people written to my great grandfather, and a beautiful rosary. It looked gold with black beads. I put everything in my room, and from that moment on, I would only sleep if I had the rosary wrapped around my right hand.

He stayed outside for months. I stopped going out as much. Work, school, then I would sit in my room and read. I would randomly get images in my head of him sitting outside, always right behind whatever window was nearest. But when I got these images, I could see his body. He was always on his hands and knees up until the night he came inside.

I closed my book and tried to lay down in silence. It's quiet for a few minutes. Then I hear what sounds like a music box. It plays for a minute. Stops. Starts again. It really is a beautiful sound. Light and melodic. I fell asleep listening to it.

I woke up with a start. He's in the corner of the room. He looks odd. Hunched. It took my tired brain a minute to realize why. He was too big to fit in the house.

The rest of his body matched his face. Hunched over slightly, his head was just a couple inches below the ceiling. Every bone in his body was stretched long and thin. All of his joints looked more prominent and made his too tight skin tear just a little. That same dark color that his eyes had. The same dark lines swirling underneath the skin. Below his knees and below his elbows his skin turned darker until his fingers and toes ended in sharp black points.

I'm sure I didn't notice all of this at the time, but I have known him for so long now that his image is burned into my mind. I also need to be clear here. I have no idea how much of this happened while I was awake and how much of this I was asleep during. The night just kept looping for me. I also have no idea how I was able to stay reasonably calm and talk to this thing. Looking back I had to have had some kind of help, but I didn't notice any other beings.

I was terrified. I didn't want to see him. So I fought and fought to wake up. I opened my eyes and looked around the empty room. Closed them again.

He was on his knees next to my bed. Leaning over me but not touching.

"Welcome back," he chuckled. His voice was deep, masculine, and clear. You wouldn't be able to pick out his voice from any normal man.

"What are you doing here? How did you get in?" I asked him.

"Does it really matter? I am here now." He put his hand on my left arm. It was so cold it burned. I screamed until I saw darkness again.

When I came to, he was still next to me, but not touching me. "I am here because I want you." He told me.

"O-okay." I replied. "Why do you want me? What do you want to do with me?"

"You are miserable. You have been for a long time. A little light always engulfed in darkness. Just say you will give yourself to me. Let me take control for a while." You wouldn't think it was possible, but his grin got wider.

"When would I come back? What will you do with control of my body?"

"Well, you will go to a place that you will enjoy much more than here. And it does not matter what I do with the body because you will not be returning."

"I. I can't. Whatever you do will be horrible. I would rather suffer than let you go free."

"Okay," he jumps on top of me. Legs on either side of me, holding my arms at my sides. "We will make it a game. I am going to stay with you. I may disappear at times, but I will always be watching. Any time something happens, I will be here. I will watch you slowly sink deeper and deeper until you beg me to take you away. When you are on your knees crying, I will make you watch me slaughter your family. Then I will finally release you before I go have some real fun."

I opened my eyes to an empty room. I closed them. Opened my eyes to him next to me. Closed them again. This kept going for the rest of the night. The next morning I woke up to my alarm and started getting dressed. Then I looked down and saw the rosary. Laying in the middle of the floor, broken into 3 pieces.

You see, whether it is fate or coincidence, our relationship always moves in loops or patterns. It has been and I believe it always will be. I am very sorry. Remembering the night that he first spoke has taken a lot of my energy. I need to take a break for now, but I will finish this. Even if he finally kills me for it.
