“Clay, wake up, we are arriving soon”

I snore lightly, open my eyes, and find myself leaning on the window. When I lift my head I notice the sweat mark that my forehead left on the window. I’m yawning and it makes me regret that I left the gum box in the trunk. 

It takes me a few seconds to realize where I am, this long-ass ride exhausted me.

In the car, there was Me, My mom, My dad, and my little sister who sat right next to me. We were on our way to some spiritual village that my mom heard about, got enthusiastic, and dragged us to spend a weekend over there. She loves these spiritual-strange things. Once a week she forces us to join her in yoga training, We were three times already in Vipassana (where you remain quiet for a whole damn week), And one time we even did a seance. Yes, you read it correctly. My mom did a seance with me and my little sister, Betty, when she was only 7 years old and since then she is having traumas even from mentioning it. My dad came out more normal, even though sometimes he can also be weird, but less than my mom. 

The city landscape that was present when I fell asleep when we left changed to a natural view of green heels and high oak trees when I woke up. The village, which I’ve known nothing about, was a 5-hour drive. We were close to there, we got off from the main road to a side road that led us to a forest. The forest was dark and full of tall trees. After 10 minutes, my dad suddenly said; “Okay, it looks like we arrived”, I lifted my head from the phone and saw that. We arrived at a huge clearing, it was of the size of 5 football yards that was surrounded by trees in each direction. In the center of the clearing there were a few small cabins alongside some farms, looks like this is the village. 

“Gosh…” I said, “What is this place?” My mom turned her head towards me: “It looks like a charming place, isn’t it?” she said enthusiastically.

“From where you heard about this shit hole?” She laughs: “At one of my mystics meetings, one of the girls talked about this place, she heard that people go there to cleanse their souls”. I look at her with a disgusted face: “Umm I don’t think that my soul needs to be purged… I’m fine”. “Yes!” Betty says also, “Why couldn’t we go to a hotel with a nice pool like everybody else!” “Ohh Betty, It’s like a hotel. just a little bit different”. 

“Of Course it is. A stinky hotel that looks like an old village from the 19th century!” Betty said sarcastically and got back to her phone.

When we got closer to the village’s entrance, we noticed that there was no parking place, and the road we had taken was blocked by a wooden gate. We veered off the side of the road, and we parked on the grass. We got out of the car, I stretched, My sister suddenly poked out her head from her phone and said: “Mom! There is no service here!”

“Really?” I asked.

“Ohhh my darlings… for once try to handle without your phones. We are in an authentic place! Am I right Robert?”

My mom asked my dad, “Yea… sure” he shrugged sarcastically and said, “It looks so authentic that there is no normal road or parking. And where are all the other tourist’s cars?” I was also wondering about that. “Well? That means that we won’t have to see other annoying tourists haha!” My mom laughed. My mom is so naive sometimes that I feel like if one day she is going to be stuck on some abandoned island and a lot of dangerous animals with no food or water she still wouldn’t suspect or be scared, as long as it’s ‘authentic’.

We took our luggage and went towards the wooden gate that blocked the road. 

“How may I help you?” 

All of us immediately turned around surprised to see an old gray-haired guy, wearing a white outfit, standing behind the wooden gate. My mom approached him and said with a smile “Hey! We are the Nelsons, a friend recommended us to come here. And we would like to stay here for this weekend, please. 

“You didn’t make reservations ?” I whispered to her

“I couldn’t find their number or website” she whispered back, and then kept smiling at the old person.

He stared at us, examines me and my family with his eyes, then he said: “I am the head of the village, what is the purpose of your visit?” 

“We came here because we heard this place helps with purification and soul cleansing” My mom replied innocently.

The old man looks at her: “Do you believe in our method?” 

“Oh, sure! we are great believers in this method” Mom said recklessly.  

“WE?!” Betty asked nervously

Dad elbowed her and told her to be quiet.

The old guy examined my mom, and after a few seconds, he said with doubt: “well… if you do believe in this method…. Sure... Come in, we would love to host you, as long as you believer” 

He takes a step back and opens the wooden gate, and lets us in.

We go through the outskirts of the village for a few minutes, walking on a dirt road, around us are some old cabins on green grass fields. Next to each cabin stood a few young ladies, also dressed in white, talking and giggling between them.

But when we passed by them, they immediately stopped laughing and looked at us with a peaceful grins. It frighted me a little, Betty didn’t even notice, she was focused on trying to get cellular reception on her phone.

My dad walked next to me and my mom walked with the village head

“So… Can you tell us a little about this place?” she asked him nicely. 

“Well... as you probably already guessed, this village is a special place,” said the village head. “It’s disconnected from any urban infrastructure. There is no electricity, water, or cellular reception here”.

“Yea. We noticed.” Betty said with an attitude. “No power and electricity?” my dad asked surprisingly, “Nope,” said the old man, “The water we pump from the well, and the electricity is being swapped by  lanterns that we light at night”.

“Every evening at 18.00 o’clock dinner is served on the lawn in the middle of the village. Right after it, everyone goes back to their cabins and stays there until the sun rises”.

“Maybe we should order pizza instead” I giggle. 

“There is no entrance for cars and people that aren't from the village”, replied the old man.

“Well, we aren’t from this village,” I said, my mom, signaled with her hand to me to knock it off with the picky questions. 

“Well…” replied the village head, he stopped and turned to me: “You are here because you believe in our METHOD”.

We keep walking through the village, and at some point, we cross the center of the village, at the center, there is a little hill and on its top a well. Surrounding the well are more young women dressed in white, laughing and giggling with each other. It seems like they are having a really good time here if they are so cheerful.

We keep going forward and after a few minutes, the old man stops next to an old wooden cabin. “ This is your place, you have bedrooms, a toilet, and a small kitchen with some basic ingredients. We will meet again at 6 pm”.

“Ummm.. when do we need to pay you?” my dad asks.

The village head turns his head to him and replies: “Don't worry, we will discuss the COST later”

Then he quickly walked away. “T.. Thank you for everything!” my mother called out to him.

We enter the cabin, and my parents open the luggage and the bags and start to unpack in their bedroom. I and Betty enter our joint room, the inside is made from wood, and two beds, one on each side. At the center, there is a dresser and on top of it a vase with a few yellow flowers in it. above it, there is a window overlooking the village and at the horizon, you can see the well at the center of the village.

I was walking around the house when suddenly: “ARE YOU SERIOUS?! We don’t even have a bloody TV here” I heard Betty from the living room. In every room that I enter, I see the same vase with a few yellow flowers. “Ummm.. mom? What’s up with these flowers?” I ask her when I get to their room. My Mom, getting closer to the vase, caresses one of the flowers: “If I am not wrong Clay.. this flower is called Calendulas”, “Calendulas?” I ask, “Yes Clay, Calendula is the name of this flower.. According to some Mexican traditions, it is believed that the Calendula has the power to summon the spirits of the dead. In Spanish they called \*‘Flor de Muerto\*’ - Flowers of the Dead”.

A strange feeling starts to fill my body, “Then... Why would they put them in every room in our cabin?” I ask, “Oh Clay… don’t underestimate other's faiths” She replies. “I do not underestimate, it just--”

\*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\* 

Before I get the chance to answer her, three soft knocks on the front door interrupts me. We’re all going towards the living room where the door is at. I spot three young ladies through the door’s window, dressed in white, smiling, and waiting in front of our door.

I open the door and they’re immediately aiming their smiling faces towards me, “Yes? how may I help yo-”

“\*Hello. Welcome. We hope that you feel comfortable here.  We brought you your clothes that you are required to wear throughout your stay here”\* 

The lady in the middle hands me two pairs of white suits and two pairs of white dresses. “Thank you!” my mom thanked them while I was busy being stupefied by their creepy smiles.

\*“Don’t forget that at six o'clock dinner is served to all the villagers. Don’t miss it! it’s going to be delicious!”\* says the lady on the left, then the three of them giggle lightly.

“We’ll be there,” my father said with a nice smile. I close the door as the three walk away calmly in a suspicious way. 

By ten to six, we've dressed all in white, Betty still trying to get used to her white dress, Dad actually feels comfortable with it, rather than wearing a business suit every day, and my mother is the most satisfied from us because it's really similar to the clothes she wears in her mystics workshops. We leave the cabin. The sun is already setting and the sky is orange. We step towards the center of the village.

As we approach, we pay attention to the well at the center of the village surrounded by a circle of large tables and chairs from its outside. All the people there are dressed in white, most of them women and a few men, all of them smiling and seeming too happy in white clothes. We are getting closer to them, and soon everyone pays attention to us and smiles, even more, I'm confused a bit and feel weird that everyone looking at me. My mother smiles awkwardly back. We sit in a row in front of the long table that surrounds the well, next to us suddenly sit three people, a father, a mother, and their son. They also seem to be tourists here. "You guys are new here?" the father asks my mom "Yeah, we got here today, it is nice to meet you, we are the Nelsons. And you?"

“We're the Mackenzie family. We arrived yesterday. Nice to see more tourists here" He replies

"How did you get here?" My dad asks "We haven't seen any more cars outside". The father of the family is surprised and says "really ? Well maybe you came from another entrance or they took the car to a shady and cooler place" he continued "but the truth is that we neither did not see vehicles when we arrived". "Oh so our two families are the only outsiders here?" My mother asks, " Well .. yesterday there was a cute couple here too .. but for some reason, I do not see them here today. And it's a shame because they miss out the most delicious meals I have eaten!"

"Really?" I ask, " Yes," the father replies, "The food here is out from another worl--" but before he finishes his sentence, a strange ring of a large bell interrupts the conversation between us, all the residents sitting down in front of the table.

Opposite the well stands the village elder we saw earlier. He stands in the center and raises his hands in the air. "Good evening. Tonight, as every night, we sit down to eat the god's food".

"Oh no. I hope it's not one of the strange religious ceremonies," I say to myself. "For this food, our community has commissioned much in the blessed purification work to bring us these foods ."

I raise my eyebrow and ask myself what already can be so pure on slaughtering a chicken or a cow ... But I was too hungry to consider my conscience. " I want to congratulate the Nelson family" the old man points out to us, "who came to our community tonight with the will of participating in the efforts to purify our souls." Everyone clapped towards us in applause and smiled. Of course. Then he says, "Have a pleasant dinner." Then a number of girls in white arrived and started serving us the dishes. The dish is a large piece of meat along with rice.

Everyone starts eating and so do we, as soon as I take a bite I feel it tastes weird.. one I have not tasted before. But then my tastebuds transmit to my mind the divine taste of this piece of meat. Oh, it's so delicious. I have never in my life tasted such delicious meat. This was a thousand better than any meat I'd eaten before. Even the rice was excellent but I was too full for it after I'd done with all the flesh. Even Mom and Dad loved it, and even my problematic sister with her pickiness of food showed signs of satisfaction.

After dinner we got up and headed back toward the cabin, we were full and satisfied. On the way there we said goodbye to the MacKenzie family who went to their cabin. " I think I'll survive through this weekend, " I tell my mother "That's great Clay, I'm glad to hear!" My sister betty is less enthusiastic but at least she does not complain about the lack of internet reception here.. It seems that the place cleansed her unsettled soul.

When we got back to the cabin and it was already night, we lit a lantern outside the door and entered the cabin. We locked the door and got ready to go to bed. The parents went to their shared bed and Betty and I went to ours and I lay down on my bed. While I was trying to fall asleep... I thought to myself why it is forbidden to leave the cabins at night? What can already happen in a sleepy village full of drug-addict all-in-white hippies, smiling every day and knowing how to make food excellent? But as my thoughts ran through my mind, I finally fell asleep.

After a few hours, I woke up, probably because I slept on the way here I wasn't that tired. It was still night, the wall clock showed 2 AM. I went to the bathroom in our cabin. When I returned to the room I looked out the window. All the cabins were dark and quiet.

But suddenly I heard a quite weak voice, I open the window to hear better, then I realize that the noise comes from the center of the village, to be more specific, from the well. It sounds .. it sounds like people. Really noisy people.

I had to check what was it, Betty was sleeping deep in the bed next to me and my parents were in their dreams in their room. I went up to the window and snuck out of it... I walked quietly on the grass towards the well. As I got closer the noise grew louder.

When I got to the middle of the village I noticed that all the tables were gone, and the noise came from INSIDE the well. "WTF..." I said to myself quietly, what is happening there in this well? I approached quietly, and then I realized it.

The voices coming from the well were screams.

People's Screamings. I was shocked… I reached the edge of the well and peeked inside. Everything was dark. There was no water there. This well does not appear to lead to a water canal. "Why would the old man lie to us about the well," I said to myself … but I was shocked and confused by the fact that something was going on there. I took the cell phone from my pocket to try to capture a video of it. A second before I came to record. The screams stopped… and the well became quiet. But then .. After a few seconds, I hear laughter ... the laughter of younger women. laughing out loud, cute laugh. But nothing was cute in this one. I pushed my cell phone into my pocket and turned around, running quietly back toward the cabin. Terrified as hell, I got quietly through the window into my and my sister's room.

As I was trying to digest what happened, I try not to wake up anyone.. dad would kill me if he finds out what I did, he is one of the old fashion dads. Mom will be disappointed in me. This is the perfect vacation for her and she already needs to endure the heaviness of me and Betty. I lay in bed and covered myself. After a few heavy breaths to calm me down I fell asleep again. Somehow.

I got up the next morning when my mother took the blanket off me nervously. " Clay! What have you done? Why did you do it to them," she says angrily, I'm trying to understand what she is referring to, " What ... what do you talk about?". " You know very well what I am talking about"

Then I suspected that she knew about it. That I left the cabin last night, but then she said something else, "why did you take the flowers from the vase?? All the vases in the house are suddenly empty"

"What the hell ?" I said, " Mom, I didn't do that " "Clay, the fact you do not respect the place and its beliefs do not mean you have to act like this and steal them!"

"Mom, I never stole any of the flowers," I said, " Clay, do not lie to me. I am so angry and disappointed in you," she said and burst out of the room. I'm exhausted from the horrible night I had, I got out of bed and then saw Betty sitting and looking at me.

"Clay … What did you do?" "Betty you have to believe me, " I tell her, I close the door and lock it. I bend over to her and whisper, "Betty ... Listen. I don't know what's the thing with this place. But last night I was near the well of the village and I heard screamings!"

" What ?" She's surprised "You snuck out from the cabin in the middle of the night ?! You know that's prohibited"

"That's not the point! Listen, Betty, something bad is happening here, I do not know what is happening there but I think we should get out of here." Now you must understand that Betty, despite being moody and sassy to everyone, She can sympathize the miseries of others. She suffered through middle school learning it in a painful way. "Clay…" she told me, " please tell me you're kidding "

"I wish I was, " I tell her. " Listen, we can't stay here for the rest of the weekend, we need to get out of here somehow"

"Good luck with trying to convince mom, " she told me.

In the afternoon, I come to my mother. "Mom.. listen… We cannot stay here."

My mother looks at me in frustration. "What's the matter, Clay? Don't tell me you became your sister."

I didn't want to tell her the REAL reason. I knew she won't buy this and will think that this was an excuse to leave the place" Mom ... please you have to believe me. I do not like this place". "Clay calm down," she says, "This place is great, we are isolated here from the modern world, eat excellent food and rest all day. I really believe we'll go through a soul purification experience that all of us need, especially you after you stole the flowers that way."

" I did not ste--"

But three soft door knocks interrupt our conversion, I approach the door. And there,  the same three girls standing outside the door. I open. And I notice that... This time, they have flowers tied to their ear, the same type of flower that vanished from our vessels, Calendulas.

"Good evening ." They say with a soft grin, "We Just wanted to make sure that you dear guests will attend today for the dinner at 6".

I stared at their flower " What’s that flower doing on your ears ?" I ask " Clay! My mom says nervously,

“ It's okay :)” The middle one says.

"We are wearing the flower because today is a special day "

" What is so special about today? " I ask, she grins and says to me " Oh, you will find out soon enough ". mother pulls my hand and drags me in. she thanks the creepy ladies and shuts the door. 

"stop being impertinent Clay, " she says and walks away.

At 6 PM we arrive at the center well again. I can’t help but think of what I heard from there last night.

Everyone is there again, smiling and giggling as if everything is as usual in this village. We came and sat down again at a table spread out in honor of the dinner. This time, the McKinsey’s that was here yesterday isn’t here, even not the spouses that the  Father noted that arrived the day before yesterday are also not here tonight. 

"Mom," I say " Where's the family that was here yesterday ?"

“ I don't know, maybe they want to stay at their cabin and rest". 

"It's weird," I tell her. Instead of them, a new family appeared in the crowd. besides us, five people were sitting, two males, two daughters, and a son. I approach the son who seems to be  my age and ask him, "Hey, is this your first day here?", 

"Yes .. our dads wanted us to go on vacation here .. How long have you been here?" He asks. I told him we arrived yesterday, and he raised an eyebrow and asked: "How did you arrive? When we parked there was no car other than ours"

WTF.  What the hell is happening in this place… I try to tell my mother about our car but….

But then suddenly this gong bell rings again, the old man stands in front of the bar and again carries the same speech, this time he thanks the Smith family, the family that sat next to us,  who ‘have chosen to join the efforts of purification and blah blah blah .. it's the same thing as he told us yesterday, only this time he directs it to this new family that joined this crazy-ass village.

The food was served. Meat and rice again. While everyone eats and enjoys it, Betty and I don’t eat. We don’t have any appetite for this food, this village, these people, and those goddamn screams.  I want answers. I want to know what's going on in this well. I decided to get up in the middle of the dinner, and suddenly all the people in white stopped to eat and talk and looked at me.. gazed without blinking as their smiles were replaced by confused and sad faces. They stared at me, the old man approached me and asked... " Why are you standing ?"

"I'm not hungry," I tell him. " Eat ... It will purify your soul"

My Mom reaches her hands towards me but I move them away, 

“No thanks. I'm not interested" I got up and went away furiously, everyone at the table staring at me walking away. My parents are embarrassed and Betty is ashamed.

In the evening the parents and Betty return to the cabin, I'm in the room. " What the hell was that Clay ?" My mother asks me angrily. 

"Mom. Enough. I can no longer..." I start crying. 

"What happened to Clay ?" She asks the anger stops for a moment as she sees her big boy bursts into tears, 

"Mom... I went out of the cabin last night. because I heard screams from the well. When I got there I heard people screaming. Screams mom… Then laughter. Women laugh... I do not know what it was. I do not know who stole the flowers, but it is not me Okay?! Didn't you notice that the family from yesterday is not here? Didn't you suspect that something fucking strange is happening in this fucking place?! and please, I know you wanted me to be here for you, but this is not a place good.. it is not a place to cleanse the mind and the soul... I just want to go home ". I cry and push my head into a pillow that was near my knees.

She breathes deeply... Not nervous, But emotional. " Clay... I don't know what have you.. what you are telling me?"

"The truth mom ... I'm telling you the truth" she put her warm hand on my head and lifts me slowly "I brought you here because I want all of us to have a good time, to get relaxed, I want to have well had a restful mind and you will be peaceful and pure. But... you are the son... And the last thing I wanted is to see you suffering like that. and if you feel this bad here... We will leave.. "

"W... what? really?" 

"Yes. You are my son Clay, and if there is no more spiritual and purified mind than to help my baby". She says. 

"I 'll tell Dad we leave tomorrow after breakfast, you and Betty start packing your belongings in the meantime."

"Thank you! Thank you Mom … Really thank you ." I thank her as my tears stop. She leaves the room and I start packing my luggage, betty entered the room, and after I told her the miracle that just happened she started to pack too.

in the middle of the night I get up again, and my entire family was sleeping, again, this time I got up, not from a bad dream tho.. rather from an odd noise. I open my eyes and get out of my bed. 

All at once, I jump in panic as I look out the window, I see one of the young ladies, standing outside in front of my window, grinning at me with the same flower in her hair. I take a step back and run towards my parent's room to wake up my dad, but as soon as I cross the living room I notice another young lady, just in front of the window near the front door, the same as the first one, she is grinning with the same stupid flower in her hair. I keep running and burst into my parent's room just to find out a third lady doing the same thing in front of the window just above my parent's bed. I scream out of fear and, my parents woke up in a panic, they look behind them to see the source of my terrifier and notice the creepy lady. "Mom, Dad!!! We have to get out of here, NOW!" I scream.

Betty woke up from my scream and she run to me after she noticed the girl. The four of us run to the living room, but as we try to open the door and get the hell out of there, we hear a soft tap on the window, there they were, the three creepy ladies that came earlier today - standing with a soft grin, acting as everything is normal. Betty screams, my mom hugs her and my dad opens the door. "What is going on here? What are you doing here in the middle of the night?!" he demands. They move slightly towards the door and say in the same calm tone "Come with us please". 

"NO, explain to us what the hell is going on here!!" I scream at them. "We won't follow you anywhere until you explain to us what's going on," says Father. " The time has arrived, the time we purify your soul," she says, suddenly at least ten women dressed in white come approach the main door, all of them, of course, smiling. They block the exit, and at the same time the other girls break the windows and get inside, we are surrounded.

They take our hands and tide them up, and take us out by force, there are too many, at least 30 of them. They are smiling and lead us to the center of the village, towards the well. When we get there I there notice that all the villagers are awake, all dressed in white, all surrounding the well, and all of them holding hands. The women bring us to the center of the circle, next to the well. The villagers chant some song in some odd language and they pray. Suddenly, all at once, everyone goes silent, we are surrounded, captive, everyone holding hands in a large circle that surrounds us and the well. They smile. The Head of the Village approaches us, he holds a flower in his hand, this time smiling too. " It's time," he says, "Dear Nelsons, It's time to finally purify your souls". 

"What does it mean to purify?? What the hell is going on here?!" I shout. 

"As you stated. You are here because you believe in our method" 

"Which damn method ??" Asks Mom in powerlessness. The old villager approaches my mother and puts her hand on her stomach, 

"I understand you enjoyed your meal today". He says. " Well, the McKinzes certainly was a pleasure meal".

Oh... no... then we realize. the meat, that so delicious meat we had ... was human flesh... the flesh of the previous tourists who came to visit here... I can't believe this is happening, that I enjoyed the taste of... Oh, My Lord, I want to vomit my whole stomach out ... the old man continued "And tomorrow all the of our community and the new guests, The Smiths, will get a taste of the god's food that will be purified from your flesh moments from now" 

Betty bursts into tears and agony, I feel like I can't breathe.. my mother is helpless and soon to pass out. But my father, my father is furious, too mad to give up.

He looks at me and then nods his head, signaling to me, that it's now or never. In a fraction of a moment, we both immediately get up and kick the girls around us. I cut with my mouth the bend they tied around my dad's hands, he does the same and we're both free. The other ladies try to reach us and attack us back and my dad pushes them away, I set free my mom and Betty and help him. Suddenly even Betty stood up and helped us, My Mother, despite all of her peaceful and spiritual agendas, helps us too. We are all fighting for our survival, The villagers gather up around us in a circle to form a human wall. I immediately came to the old man and I'm knocking him to the floor. I grab him by his neck, strangling him, and lock my elbows so he will not be able to release or fight back. Immediately all the people in the circle are alarmed, few ladies try to rescue him from me, but I scream: "One more step and I will break the old man's neck!"

The old man is barely able to breathe. "Move! Get back" My dad yells with a stone in his hand he found near the well, The villagers get back slowly but are still alarmed, they let us go from the fear that will kill their old man. My Father commands the old man to show us where they store the car, the old man with his face turning blue, pointed the way, Me, My Father, Betty, and Mom start to run as the old man is our hostage, the people behind us try to come after us, " Stay there !" I yell. The old man orders them to stay with his hand gestures. 

After a few minutes, we reached a rusty warehouse, the old man points to the door and we enter.

As we get inside, we are in shock at the view, dozens of cars, family SUVs probably of previous tourists who were here and were eaten".

"What the hell," I say to myself. "How many of them did you slaughter and ate" I yell at the Old Man and tighten my hands even more around his neck. We find our car, My Father opens the trunk and tells me to put the old man inside, I throw him in and close the trunk, we enter our car quickly and my father ignites the engine.

He hits the speed break, and the car drives through the warehouse walls. in the rear mirror, we notice a bunch of the ladies in white, at least 50 of them, running after the car and crying out, "NO!!! NO!!!" "BRING OUR DAD BACK", "PLEASE!!!" but they are not fast enough, Dad traveling at full speed towards the main gate and breaking it. We leave the village and head towards the forest.

We are driving in the forest, traveling at full speed, and after around 10 minutes our car started slowing down... no fuel ... they must have emptied most of the tank. The car slowly loses its speed ... and finally, comes to a full stop. 

Luckily or not it was enough of us to arrive at some lonely motel, it seemed empty enough for us to sneak the old man without anyone noticing. While dad and mom were talking to the reception guy about getting the cheapest room, I and Betty were holding the old man with our hands, pretending he was our old grandpa who is too old to walk by himself. We got into the room on the ground floor, with a view of the dark forest. Dad knocked the old man out and put him in the bathroom and locked the door. As they think about how to explain the whole situation to the police, I sit down to write this crazy story. 

It's 2 AM and I've been distracted by this noise, the same eerie noise that I've heard the first night, it's this creepy laughter again. I poke my head from the screen and... I can see them, the ladies in white, they are standing outside of our window, leaning their heads on the glass and starting to whisper...

\*"PLEASE OPEN... WE ARE HUNGRY", "YESSS WE ARE STARVING", "PLEASE OPEN LET US IN"...\* 

I would have to end the story here. because the window slowly starts to break, as well as the main door.
