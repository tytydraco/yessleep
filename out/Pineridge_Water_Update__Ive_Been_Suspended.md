Hey, Sam here. Things have been rough the past couple days, and I figure I owe an update. If nothing else, I want this written down so people know what’s happening. 

This "flu" hasn’t gone away. Word around town is that some folks are getting better, but others are still coming down sick. From the outside it seems like a normal bug moving through town: fevers, nausea, headaches, aches in the joints. 

But it’s subtle too—tingling fingers, stiff joints, brief bouts of vertigo—all of which the hospital insists are just part of recovering from a virus like the flu. To me, though, it fits a pattern I can’t ignore. The timing lines up too neatly with the appearance of that stuff in the water, and I keep hoping Doc Marlowe will have some answers.

I reached out to Doc Marlowe’s clinic — I’ve mentioned him before. He’s been running that little family practice in Pineridge since before I was born. Both his family and his clinic have always had the community’s trust. It’s the kind of place people go when they want someone to actually listen, not just run tests and send a bill. Marlowe agreed to take a look at a sample for me. I thought, finally, I’d have someone who could confirm what I’ve been seeing. I wish it could’ve stayed that way.

The Board didn’t like my outreach. They sent me an official notice: I’m suspended for a “repeated breach of conduct.” That’s the phrase they used. It’s not a firing, but it means I’m not allowed on the plant floor, not allowed to run tests, not allowed near the equipment. Which, from their point of view, means I’m out of the way.

And they didn’t just tell me—they sent a damn company-wide announcement. Some bland corporate memo about how “unprofessional behavior and unnecessary concern have no place in our workplace.” They didn’t name me directly, but everyone knew. A couple of the guys I thought were on my side, who had previously raised this issue with the Board, won’t even return my calls.

I think the point is clear: frame me as obsessive and paranoid. Make me the guy who won’t let the water thing go, despite repeated assurances from higher-ups and the hospital that everything is “safe.” If they can convince everyone else of that, nobody has to justify my suspension—or answer the questions I’ve raised.

If you’re reading this and live in Pineridge—or even if you’ve just got family here—please don’t write me off. I’ve seen the water that’s getting through.

Last night, a note appeared in my mailbox from Doc Marlowe. Just a few lines, handwritten:

“Sam, you were right about the water. Take this key — it opens the safe at my clinic. My test results are inside. I’m leaving before it’s too late for my family and me. Be careful.”

The key was taped to the back.

I don’t know what exactly made the Marlowe family up and leave — whatever’s in the water, boiling it should take care of it. Everyone in town knows how badly the hospital wants that clinic gone, to be the only medical centre in Pineridge. 

I’m not saying the hospital or even the Board forced anyone out, but it’s suspicious timing for the only practitioner supporting my claims to suddenly leave town with his whole family.

For the first time in weeks, I feel some relief. Finally, validation. Finally, someone else who saw what I did. That what I’ve been fighting the Board over—and warning all of you about—is real. I can only hope Marlowe’s results confirm what I suspect, and that he left no trace of wrongdoing behind for the Board to erase.

If you don’t trust me, then trust Doc Marlowe. We all know that he is no fear-monger or conspiracy theorist. **Boil your water**.

I’ll head over to the clinic as soon as I post this and see what he left behind. Whatever’s in that safe has to be important enough for him to risk giving it to me. I’ll report back as soon as I know more.
