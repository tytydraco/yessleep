We keep hearing voices mimicking our own. I live with my wife, my brother, and his fiance. My wife and I have had several incidents in which voices were heard mimicking my wife and me respectively while the other was either not in the room and on the other side of the house, or even gone altogether. And this started before family moved in.

When I was just a kid I had what I consider my first incident involving what is known as the infamous "Hag". The crucial difference was that it wasn't manifested through sleep paralysis at first.

I remember being in control somehow, but not in my physical form. I left my room, moving to the front door when I felt eyes on me from behind.

My grandma kept only the light above the stove on, so when I turned I saw the silhouette of a short bony woman with stringy hair in the doorway of the the kitchen, backlit by the stove light, no other features could be seen.

I'm sure you'd expect to read that this thing had rushed toward me on all fours to devour me, however all she did was stand as her head turned, seeming to watch me as I slowly crept back to my room.

Since that day I'd seen several things during sleep paralysis, but mostly the hag plagued my trances. One of my most memorable and terrifying was the sleep paralysis episode in which I was laying on my bed, which was against the window while facing away from it.

I heard the sound of the fingernails scraping across the glass. Followed by the voice of a disembodied voice of an old woman. "Let me in." She said.

After several moments I heard the sound of the window being squeaked open, I felt the cold, bony body of the thing slip under the covers with her gnarled fingers slowly digging into my ribs, her nails cutting deep.

She was about knuckle deep when I was finally able to break myself out of it. The old woman was a regular occurrence, along with a few others.

I never thought it was anything more than some sort of inherited sleep disorder, being that I remember numerous times I'd woken my dad up from such episodes.

That was until I stumbled across the phenomena of what sleep paralysis was to many people. A plethora of accounts describing the "Hag" and other things of the sort. It became hard to view as nothing more than a coincidence.

Which leads us back to our current problem, I still have sleep paralysis trances, only I no longer see the things that plagued my trances, but I still hear them.

At first, it was the usual "Hey did you call my name?"

'No, I've been asleep, id respond. (TV off mind you.)"

my wife swore I walked behind her and asked "What are you doing?" In my voice. mind you I was dead asleep

Another time my wife had been gone grocery shopping. I'm playing Xbox when I distinctly hear my wife call "Baby can you help me with groceries?) Of course I got up to help only to find no wife, and noone in the driveway.

After my brother moved in we've had even more episodes. My brother and I have the same sounding voice, but I can only give my word that neither was the culprit as to the case of sound maybe traveling to create possible auditory illusions, and I can vouch for the previous incidents. I have this gut feeling that it's the old woman trying to work her way back in, not only into my life, but that of my family's lives. I'll update when I can.
