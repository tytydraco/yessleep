*Four candles, one marking each cardinal direction. Their light both beckons and forms a barrier.*


*An offering of death to bring back life, placed just beyond the candlelight.*


*A blindfold to leave things better left unseen.*


*The words.*


I was never brave enough to try it as a kid. My grandmother brought it from the Old Country (which, in her case, meant upstate, but she insisted her mother had learned it from *her* mother, who brought it from the Old Country) and got very cross if we called it a game on par with mass produced ouija boards. Letting the silence speak was not an idle pastime made to amuse children. 


It was an invitation.


She only told us about it so we wouldn't learn from someone else later and do something stupid. The way she said it, with her eyes narrowed into dark slits and her brow bunched into a row of lines that got deeper every year, made me a believer. 


Not that it took much convincing. I was prone to jumping at shadows and walking quickly away from any unexpected bumps in the night. It made me a target of teasing from family and friends, but I always figured it was better to be safe than sorry.


I never really grew out of being superstitious, but I did eventually grow into liking boys, which, as anyone who likes boys can attest, leads to some questionable decisions.


Like when I agreed to go to Sean's party. 


I wasn't the party type. Not unpopular, not excluded, just not interested. Usually I turned down the invitations in favor of smaller get togethers to the mall or movies, but this was *Sean's* party. That made all the difference. By the time it rolled around, people generally only asked me to go as a courtesy, fully expecting to be turned down, but Sean slapped one hand on my desk, jabbed a finger between my eyes, and told me I was going to his place Saturday. Everyone was, no exceptions (which sounds wild if you don't know we were a class of thirty). It was going to be our senior year blow out extravaganza!


How could I say no?


When Saturday rolled around, I put a little more effort into my appearance than usual, dotting some color on my cheeks and lips and attempting to do anything with my hair except my go-to braid. Mischa rolled up right at 8, punctual as ever, and I waved to my family as I ran out the door.


Every light in Sean's house must've been on, making it glow against its woodland surroundings, and the front yard doubled as a parking lot. Mischa found a place to squeeze in and grabbed my hand, pulling me from the car to bounce along to the music as we walked to the front door. Sean hadn't lied about everyone attending and we were greeted with a chorus of hellos as we came in, with more than one expressing shock that I'd actually showed up.


“How could I miss the extravaganza?”


Easily, as it turned out.


The “extravaganza” was nothing more than the usual party fare: dancing, party games, groups huddled into conversations they could barely hear over the music. I didn't care to drink and, though Mischa tried to convince me otherwise, I wasn't much of a dancer either, which left me sitting on the couch with a can of soda, watching my best friend flit around like a gossip-fueled butterfly.


“It's bombing, isn't it?” I jumped when Sean sank down next to me with a heavy sigh.


“No, people are having a great time!”


“They're just doing what they always do. I had other stuff I wanted to do, but Mom and Dad said no to everything. At least Skyler could bring the beer so I didn't have to try and hide it.”


“That sucks.” It did, but I thought it was kind of cute that he cared what his parents said. It was something we had in common.


“Yeah, so now the party does, too.”


I shouldn't have said what I said next. It was just…he looked so sad about this party he'd spent so much time talking up going down as “average”. If there was any way I could help, I was determined to do it, all my grandmother's warnings and my own nerves be damned. 


It wasn't like it was actually going to work anyway.


“I might have an idea.”


I'd never been good at class presentations. I hated having everyone's eyes on me. So when Sean turned off the music and shouted for everyone to shut up and gather around, I froze, my carefully selected powder blush paling in comparison to the natural one burning in my cheeks.


“You ok?” Mischa mouthed, readying to step in and drag me out of the spotlight if I gave the word.


I found myself nodding when Sean plopped down next to me again, closer this time, and draped an arm loosely across my shoulders.


A few minutes of scaring myself was really seeming worth it.


“Elle is going to teach us a game!”


“Well, it's not–” I weakly protested, but an interested murmur ran through the crowd. 


“Come on, tell them about it.”


“It's…it's not a *game*, exactly. It's kind of like a ouija board?” I flinched internally as I said it, imagining Grandma's disapproving scowl. 


“Like ghosts and shit?” someone asked.


“Sort of. My grandma always called it letting the silence speak. You need four candles, some raw meat with its blood–”


A few snickers rippled through my classmates and I heard a distinct, “Gross!” from one of the girls.


“Shut up!” Sean said before giving me an encouraging smile.


“You set the candles up so one is to the north, one, south, you know. The meat goes on the outside of the circle. A person sits in the middle with a blindfold and they say some stuff…”


I shrugged, glad I'd worn my hair down so I could hide behind it. It had seemed like a better idea when Sean was excitedly listening to me explain it the first time.


“And then?” Mischa asked, coaxing me to finish.


“Then it has to be totally quiet. If there are any ghosts or whatever, you'll hear them.  They can't speak over the living or something.”


“Bullshit,” Andreas said. “Let's turn the music back on.”


“I want to try it,” Mischa shot back. “You got any candles, Sean?”


He was up and off before she finished asking. I didn't know whether I wanted to thank her or not.


***


Being on the couch with everyone staring at me had been bad enough, but sitting on the floor with the candles in place, plates of raw, bloody ground beef in front of me, and everyone circled around made me feel like a circus act. They were all waiting for me to perform.


Sean smiled, motioning for me to start.


I took a deep breath. “Ok, so, once I light the candles, everyone needs to be super quiet. This only works if there's silence.”


“Bullshit,” Andreas muttered again.


I clicked on the grill lighter Sean had dug out for me and lit the first candle. The flame shook with my hand, but I brought it to each wick. 


“Four candles to call to four corners,” I recited, hearing Grandma as I did so. I hoped no one else noticed the tremble in my voice.


*It's just a game,* I thought, though it didn't feel like anything else I'd ever played.


A titter of giddy nervousness collided with sharp whispers for quiet.


“An offering of death to bring back life.” I pushed the plates to the outsides of the candles, careful of the blood speckled at their edges.


*Nothing is going to happen.*


“A blindfold to leave things better left unseen.” I tied the ribbon Mischa had taken from her hair around my eyes and waited for the giggling to stop. It gave me a moment to quickly lick my lips, which had gone dry. “I am listening. Let the silence speak.”


I kept telling myself it wasn't real while my heartbeat grew steadily faster. I held my breath. I think everyone else did too. A hush fell around me, filling the room like a balloon on the verge of bursting.


And then, a lone, thin voice pierced the silence.


“Thiiiis. Iiiiis. Bullshiiiit.”


There was laughter and swearing and, when I took the blindfold off, Andreas was grinning smugly. Mischa punched his shoulder and he laughed.


“Sorry, Elle. No ghosties,” he said.


“Dick,” Sean replied for me.


With the mood ruined, the music came back on the and party resumed, all attempts to let the silence speak gone out the window.


“Sorry, Elle,” Sean said more genuinely than Andreas had.


I fumbled for a smile that didn’t look too googoo eyed. “It's ok. It was a dumb idea anyway.”


“No, it was fun! Thanks for trying.”


If his parents didn't choose that moment to pull into the driveway, sending everyone with a beer can fleeing, I would've been happy to stand right there for the rest of the night. Mischa grabbed my hand as she bolted by, however, and I could only wave over my shoulder as she dragged me away.


***


I was glad almost no one found letting the silence speak memorable enough to bring it up on Monday. Mostly everyone was bummed Sean's parents had returned early, cutting the evening short. Sean, on the other hand, was upset that Andreas had spoiled the game.


“We could try again,” he said, twisted in his seat to face me.


The memory of how uneasy I'd been during the failed attempt made me hesitate.


“Of course we will!” Mischa perched on the edge of my desk, arms folded over her chest.


“I don't know. It's probably not a great idea? My grandma would be really upset if she knew…”


“Soooo…don't tell her?” Mischa nudged me. “Just one more try! Tonight, my place. Mom's going out for a ‘business dinner’, which means she's hooking up with her boss and won't be home until late.”


“I–”


“It's the perfect place! Old farm house, at least a hundred years of history. Someone's gotta have died in all that time, right?”


“Maybe?”


“I'm down if you are, Elle,” Sean said, and just like that, all my doubts were gone.


***


I'd never thought of Mischa's house as creepy. It was just her house. In our small town, old houses built on acres of woods were a dime a dozen, so it never really occurred to me to think about their history. 


Not until Dad was driving me over to “study”, and I had twenty minutes to wonder how long the Lotley house had actually been there, what might have gone on in the woods surrounding it, and how many people had passed through its doors, never to exit again. 


It was almost surprising to come out of the treeline the bordered her driveway to find a perfectly normal house. The same one I'd been half-living at since I was seven.


“How long you thinking?” Dad asked.


“9? Mischa will bring me home.” 


Unless something goes horribly wrong…


*Stop it! You're being stupid!*


Dad waited until Mischa let me in before pulling away. Once his car was out of sight, we ran to the living to set up.


“He's totally into you,” Mischa said.


“Shut up.” I rolled my eyes, but fiddled with the candle I was holding. “You think so?”


“You *really* think this is about ghosts?”


“It could be?” I grunted when a pillow bounced off the side of my head. “Hey!”


“You deserved it! Now, the plan is, you'll do your little blindfold trick, I'll get too scared and slip out, and you two can do whatever it is you two do.” She wiggled her eyebrows until I returned pillow fire right into her face.


“Don't be gross,” I said as headlights shone around the edges of the front window's curtains.


“And you don't be dumb! I'm giving you a real chance here!”


She giggled and hightailed it for the door, where Sean was waiting. There was a little awkwardness after the initial greetings while the three of us stood in the entryway, until Mischa took me by the arm and gestured for Sean to follow.


“According to Mom, some relative of ours built this place in the 1870s and it's just kept getting passed down. Don't know much else about it, but maybe that'll change tonight.” Mischa winked at me.


I half-smiled back. Knowing her plan left my stomach feeling fluttery and I could barely look at Sean.


It helped me forget anything else I'd been nervous about.


“We're set up in here. You guys ready to start?” 


“Hell yeah,” Sean said.


I just nodded.


We took our positions, me in the middle of the candles on the floor, Mischa sitting strategically on the recliner closest to the door, and Sean on the couch next to me. I swallowed hard and lit the first candle.


***

Something was different right away. Without Mischa and Sean speaking, the quiet took on a weight it hadn't had at Sean’s house. I could almost feel it like a layer of fine mist on my arms. It was closing in. Expectant. 


I shook my head and rolled my shoulders, dismissing it as my jittery imagination. 


*It’s not real.*


“Four candles to call to four corners.”


The flames jumped upon their wicks and when I glanced at Sean, I saw he was leaning forward, eyes a little wider than usual. He saw it too. 


But houses like this are notoriously drafty. It meant nothing.


“An offering of death to bring back life.”


My eyes zeroed in on the bowl of chopped up steak sitting at the base of the northern candle in front of me. 


Had one of the pieces…moved?


Another glance at Sean showed he was still fixated on the candles, which hadn't flickered so harshly again.


My breath was coming unevenly through my nose. I tried to slow it down, but thinking about it only made it worse. I chewed my lip, hand hovering over the bandana blindfold Mischa had laid out. Goosebumps ran all the way up my arm and I rubbed it quickly, reminding myself nothing would happen except for getting a little alone time with Sean.


I picked up the bandana and stumbled over the words as I tied it over my eyes.


“A…a blindfold to leave things better left unseen.”


Sean and Mischa stayed perfectly silent. 


My breathing filled my ears. I could feel my pulse beating in my neck. 


“I am listening. Let the silence speak.”


The final word had barely left my mouth before the whispers began. They were soft at first, like distant scratches on a wall. The scurrying of mice. A chill seeped into the room, growing as the whispers did, and my teeth chattered from fear and cold.


“Guys?” I choked on the word. It felt like an icicle being dragged up my throat.


“You ok, Elle?” Mischa asked with an unsure half-laugh.


“She's messing with us,” Sean replied with a short.


I could barely hear them over the whispers.


*Help me!*


*She did this to me, that bitch!*


*Please…I want to go home…*


Plaintive, angry, hurt. They came all once, but all in different voices that scraped against my skull. It was dull, but piercing, whispers, but so loud my ears rang. I couldn't tell which way they were coming from, only that they filled the house the same way the silence had, with a cold, misty weight I could feel against my skin.

“You don't hear them?” I had to shout; I couldn't hear myself over them. 


“Stop, Elle, you're not being funny,” Mischa said. There was no laughter in her voice now.


“Man, you got me good. I even thought I saw the candles go all weird for a second.” Sean didn't sound as enthusiastic as he had before.


*Please!*


*I'll slit her fucking throat!*


*Where's Mama?*


Unable to stand it any longer, I tore the blindfold off with a strangled cry.


“Elle, talk to us!”


“What's wrong?”


The shadows had gathered before me. They grew and lost limbs, standing on mismatched limbs, reaching with hands gnarled by age and baby soft. Faces swam over the bubbling dark. I met the pale, madly rolling eyes only briefly. Long enough for them to lock on to me. To see.


The voices swelled.


*Help!*


*Bitch!*


*Mama?”


Sean and Mischa had to chase after me into the yard and down the driveway. I tried to throw them off when they finally caught me. I couldn't let them take me back inside! I kept screaming and struggling until they forced me into Mischa's car and she drove me home.


I kept my eyes closed the whole way.


“What happened?” she asked over and over again, but I didn't answer.


I couldn't.


She passed me off to my concerned parents and Grandma with some made up story about food poisoning and offered to stick around until I felt better, but I shook my head and let Mom lead me upstairs.


Once in my room alone, I curled up, still dressed, in bed, trying to shake the image of what I'd seen. The sound of their voices. The whispers continued to feel so real, weighted, like I could still hear them.


A knock on my door sent them scurrying and I tilted my head to see Grandma stepping in. She shut the door behind her and stood at the foot of my bed.


“Eleanor,” she said softly, hands wringing together. “What have you done?”


“Nothing,” I mumbled limply. “I…”


In the silence that stretched between us, the scratching began again. Quieter than at Mischa’s, but still pulling itself into whispers.


I bolted upright to see Grandma turning on my radio to a jarring pop song that drove out the silence. 


“I tried to warn you,” she said, sitting wearily in my desk chair. 


Tears burned in the corners of my eyes. “I'm sorry.”


“I know.”


“How do I make it stop?”


My grandmother shook her bowed head slowly before lifting it to meet my gaze.


“Oh, Elle,” she said. “You don't understand. You wanted to hear the silence, and now, it wants to be heard.”
