That was back in December. When I left everything behind. I threw away my phone, cashed out my bank account, and sold my car for quick cash. I used some of that to buy another car from some guy online. He signed over the title, but I didn’t register it. I kept his tags. I spent the first couple of weeks just driving, sleeping (on the rare occasions I could actually sleep) in the backseat of my car in parking lots and rest stops. Here and there, I would pay cash at a roadside motel. I wanted to know how Mark was doing, but going to the hospital was out of the question. I picked up a couple cheap pay as you go phones and used one to call the hospital to get his status. The charge nurse wouldn’t tell me much except that he was currently in “stable condition.” At least that meant alive. I tossed that phone as soon as I hung up. Basically, I was doing all the things I had seen in anyone in a show or movie had done to not be found. For a month, those things seemed to serve me well. 

At the beginning of February, someone found me. I don’t know how. My instincts have been horribly awry since the whole thing started (honestly, they were probably way off long before then), but something about this told me it wasn’t the big bad “them.” I had one of my infrequent motel nights, and the next morning, there was a note on the floor in front of the door. It was a folded sheet of copy paper. I stayed where I was on the bed, eyeing this intrusive document like it was a viper poised to strike. How? I had sat outside the motel for an hour making sure I would only interact with the one front desk clerk. I checked the lobby before checking in and there were no cameras. Were there cameras I couldn’t see? To say this place was barely a one-star facility would be generous. Surely, hidden cameras were too luxurious and would deter the bulk of the intended clientele. 
I checked the time. I had only been asleep for three hours. Carefully, I inched toward the door, tiptoed to the peephole and looked around. No one. I didn’t expect to see anyone, but I had to check. I picked up the paper and the outward part of the fold was blank. I opened it and typed in small black letters: “You are not safe. Find me.” 
Below that was an address and instructions on how to approach. I was to wear a blue shirt and my green tennis shoes. I had to park my car on the left side of the building and get out of it from the passenger’s side. It said if I did not follow these instructions precisely, I would not meet the author of this note. Now my only question was do I want to?

I had about four hours to decide. The address was only a twenty-minute drive - another motel two exits away. I placed the note on the bed, backed away from it - as if seeing it from a greater distance would tip the scales one way or the other. It didn’t. My stomach churned. When did I last eat? The thought popped into my head, and I flicked it away just as swiftly. I didn’t care. I was there in that cold room, standing like a statue on that threadbare carpet. The indecision had me stuck. Then without consciously choosing, I let out a grunt of frustration, rubbed my eyes, and walked into the bathroom. 
I splashed my face with cold water, saw my tired, unkempt reflection in the greasy mirror. It had been almost a week since I had a good, hot shower. I walked back to the bed, lifted my bag from the floor, removed my toiletries and a clean towel (even if there had been any here, I wouldn’t trust it). The water didn’t get hot, but I felt better after I was clean. I had to go. I knew there were dangers in going, but if this person had answers, could I really pass that up? It could be the same one that left the picture at the police station or the DVD on my apartment door. If they wanted to hurt me, they would have done that, right? 

I dressed in a blue shirt, jeans, and green tennis shoes. As I tied the laces, I remembered the day I bought these. Michelle and I were on a mission to rebuild my wardrobe since all my possessions were gone and I couldn’t keep borrowing her stuff. We went to a local thrift store and these shoes were sitting on a rack. Kermit green. Michelle hated them. 

“Do not get those ugly things. Looks like they made them out of Kermit the Frog,” Michelle laughed as I tried them on. I loved them and ignored her eye roll when I put them in my cart. 

The memory echoed across the time and distance between then and now. Too much had happened. The vision of Michelle’s laughter caused me physical pain. 

I packed up my things, wiped down any surface I touched. This may have been pointless because I probably have hair in the shower or on the bed, but I felt better doing it. I got in my car and drove to the McDonald’s almost halfway between my motel and my destination. I had to kill two more hours. The wait was agony. 

Time was not moving. I watched cars drift in and out of the drive-thru, people walking in and out. I gave in and bought a meal there myself, forcing down every bite. I saw a million people pass by me during the thousand hours I sat there, waiting for the clock to tick forward. Finally, there were only fifteen minutes to go. 
My stomach did a backflip as I shifted into drive and made my way down the road, hoping the destination wasn’t my final one. 

Room 21B. I had knocked. The seconds ticked by and I could hear my heartbeat pounding in my ears, feel it in my throat. Then came the soft metallic rattle of a slide chain from the other side of the door, the doorknob twisted, and the door opened. The hand shot out from the dark chasm of the doorway grabbing me, covering my mouth. I reared back, an electric shock pulsing through me, putting my legs into overdrive. But then an arm ensnared my torso, making escape impossible. I was being dragged inside the dark room, as the safety of the world beyond - the swirling light from the sun, the bitter chill of the wind, all the color and freedom - was extinguished as the door shut with a snap that might as well have been the closing of a coffin. I wriggled and writhed like an eel trying to break loose from whoever had me locked in their clutches. Then a voice sounded in my ear, so close I could feel the breath from their urgent but quiet whisper.

“Stop struggling. I am not here to hurt you.” I knew that voice as well as my own. 



It was Michelle.
