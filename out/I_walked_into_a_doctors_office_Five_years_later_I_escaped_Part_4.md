I had nothing to contribute aside from my horror and revulsion, so I was sent home. Michelle tried her best to calm me on the drive back home, but we were both filled with dread as we stood in front of my apartment door. A large envelope was taped to it and in thick black letters it said: OPEN NOW. Michelle reached her hand up to pull it off the door, but I smacked it away.

“Liz… We have to see what’s in there,” she said, in her most reasonable tone.

The words were caught in my throat. I wanted to open it. I wanted to throw it away. I wanted to burn down the door and run until I couldn’t run anymore. I stood, transfixed, at this innocent or deadly message. “Call the police. Ask for Officer Keshner. Tell him…” I trailed off, unsure.

“Ok.” Michelle didn’t need me to finish. She was pulling her phone from her pocket and dialing before I finished speaking. She got Keshner on the line, explained what we found. He arrived within minutes, along with two other cops. I had been rooted to the spot, as if standing on a landmine. When he carefully removed the envelope, I relaxed, but only slightly. He had latex gloves on his massive hands. He was careful not to rip the envelope as he opened it. It contained a single item: a DVD. It was just the disc, a rewritable one. One side had a sticker on it like a label that said: “Test #3. Conv. Attempt #7.” The handwriting was different from the envelope. This was slanted, cramped, and untidy.

“Do you have a DVD player?” Keshner asked us. I shook my head no. Michelle said she had a PlayStation that would probably work. “Alright. We will have to take this in for evidence, but, Ms. Lafleur, do you want to see what’s on it before we go?”

No. I don’t. I want this to be over, I thought. But I found myself nodding my head yes and walking over to Michelle’s place to watch the damn thing anyway. Michelle and I sat on her couch. Officer Keshner stood near the TV, controller in hand, loading up the disc.

The video started. You could see a bright, white room. In the center was a woman in a wheelchair. Her face was partially covered in thick bandages that obscured her forehead, nose, cheeks, and chin. Her eyes looked glassy, groggy. She was wearing a white hospital gown, and her legs were covered by either a thin white blanket or sheet. There was a rhythmic chime sound every few seconds, it was low and unobtrusive. A voice began to speak, but the owner remained off screen. I knew that voice, the deep tone and strange cadence: the doctor.

“What is your name?” he asked. The woman did not respond. He repeated the question, a little louder and more insistent. Still no reply. The was a sharp buzz and a yelp from the woman. The question again.

“B…Bi…” she tried, trying to shake her answer from her mouth. Another quick buzz and a yelp. “Bianca. S…S-Sinclair.”

“Incorrect. Your name is Elizabeth LaFleur,” he stated. Ice slipped into my stomach and chilled my every nerve. “Another round of therapy for Test subject #3, nurse. Up the dose. Double. This one is stubborn.” And the video ended. I could not look away from the screen, but I felt everyone else’s eyes upon me. I felt like an imposter. Was I? Who sent this? Why? I am a nobody. There was simply nothing about me that would be interesting enough to make more of me.
Or was that the point?

I was holding Michelle’s hand when the video started. I kept squeezing harder as it played. When it ended, I felt guilty. She pulled her hand from mine and winced. Officer Keshner turned to me, mouth open in either surprise or disgust.
“This was here when you got home?” he asked.
“Yeah. Just like you found it. We didn’t touch it.” I confirmed.

“Ok. We will have to send everything out to try and verify this is real. It could be someone’s idea of a joke. Anyone who read about you a few months ago could have put this together. We’ll see if there are any fingerpr—” he was explaining when I cut him off.

“No. I think it’s real. That room… I’ve been there. It’s exactly the same. Even that weird hum, I think from the lights. It’s the same,” I said. I was beyond positive this wasn’t a hoax. Keshner examined my face. I’m not sure what he was searching for, but seemed to find it, then nodded.

“Alright then. We still have to investigate it, but I will try to run down any leads on this. Don’t get your hopes up, though. This isn’t much to go on. We’ll start with this Bianca. See if there’s anything out there about her going missing or…” Dead. He didn’t say the word, but I knew. Which would be worse? Living, convinced you are someone else, or dying?

A few officers went through both Michelle’s and my apartments, checking for any sign of intrusion. Keshner checked the windows and doors to make sure they were secure. He pulled a business card from his wallet, wrote something on the blank backside of it, and handed it to me.
“This top number is my personal cell. The bottom number is my direct line at the station. If anything comes up or you need me, call. I don’t care what time,” he told me and then he left. It was such a kind gesture; I almost cried. He believes me. I had two people in the world that truly believed me: Michelle and now Keshner. I looked at the card, flipped it over and realized I had never even asked for his first name. It was Mark.

That night Michelle insisted on staying over. She suggested we have a slumber party, like the good old days. I didn’t want to kill her mood and admit I don’t remember any of our sleepovers. We didn’t exactly live close to each other. I just took comfort in her being this relentlessly positive force in my life. I had escaped months ago, but that coldness had not fully left my bones. I was in my own place, but it took Michelle being here – fully accepting me, not doubting, not pressing for answers I didn’t have – to get it to finally sink in, warming me from the inside.

A nagging little voice in the back of my mind said: She’s never asked you any questions about that time. Does she really believe me? Is she just playing along? Am I that fragile? I dismissed the thought. I was lucky to have Michelle as family and friend.

“I would be lost without you, Michelle,” I said as the credits rolled on our second John Hughes film of the night. “You’re my best friend. Thank you for…” There wasn’t a big enough word. “Everything.” She looked at me in mild surprise. Her mouth opened slightly as if to speak but thought better of it and gave me a big too-tight hug instead. She pulled back, looking at the ground, wiped away a tear and said, “No thanks necessary. We’re family. That’s what families do.” This was thoroughly not my experience from life, but I left it alone. I felt like I was finally coming home.

I still had the nightmares. I still called Mark on a semi-daily basis for updates, but the next few weeks felt almost normal. I worked from home answering calls for an insurance company. I had groceries delivered. Michelle said the one (and only one) good thing is that I completely missed the whole Covid thing.

“Everyone was in lockdown. So, it’s not like you were really missing out,” she added one day after telling me about the pandemic. She used to be such a quiet, mousy little thing, but she had developed a wonderfully dark sense of humor in my absence. She would joke, seemingly callously, about my missing time. Anyone outside might get offended, but I enjoyed it. It took the weight from it, lessened the sting. If I could laugh at it, then it couldn’t beat me.
