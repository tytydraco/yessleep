If Bethany hadn't decided to play the stupid game, none of us would have been in this situation in the first place.  
That's how simple life was, really.   
One decision, just one wrong decision, and everything was changed.   
\-  
It started out small and insignificant, as most big things do.  
Bethany came home from work in a flurry, dumped her handbag on the coffee table, unwrapped her bright red scarf and excitedly told us all about this new game she'd heard about that day.   
Jonas and I listened half heartedly, more nodding than actual hearing as there was a game playing on TV.   
We both were much more interested in keeping score than hearing about some game our roommate had found out about.  
She asked us if we were keen to play later on that evening, and without even taking my eyes off the screen, I had nodded, yeah.  
I really wish I'd been paying more attention.  
\-  
It was Jonas' turn to cook, which meant I would be heading to the shops later for a little midnight snack.  
It wasn't that he couldn't cook, he just wasn't good at it.   
And by the looks of what he was preparing, it would be the same thing as he made last week, and the week before that, and every single week since we had been living together.   
Chicken lasagna.   
I loved Jonas, he had been my friend for so long, but I was so sick of his food.   
I never had the heart to tell him, though.   
Somethings were just better left unsaid.   
\-  
The game was simple, according to Bethany.  
She gathered us into the loungeroom, where she'd moved the couch to the wall, making the loungeroom space so much larger.   
A bunch of pillows were arranged on the floor, a few wine glasses and a glass decanter were perched atop the coffee table.   
She handed us both a wineglass, full of a shimmery red liquid, wine by the look and smell.   
I shot a glance at Jonas, who was holding the wineglass away from his body in disgust, as if it got to close to him, he would be poisoned.   
Bethany didn't seem to notice, she just hummed along as she slowly savored and sipped her own drink.   
I suppose she had just somehow forgotten that Jonas was sober 5 years now, he never drank, staying totally free of alcohol.   
Jonas raised his eyebrow to me, and I shrugged kindly back in response.   
When Bethany's back was turned, I swapped my empty glass with Jonas full one, and downed his in one quick gulp.  
He thanked me with an appreciative smile.   
\-  
The game may may have been simple, but it was honestly weird as fuck.   
First, we did some sort of bizarre chant with Bethany leading the way and us repeating the words she spoke, all of us three standing around in a makeshift circle, holding hands.  
It really felt like more of a way to summon an actual demon, than play what was meant to be considered a 'fun game', but I knew Bethany hated being the only female in the house, and felt left out of Jonas and I love for football, so I guess I just wanted to accommodate her into feeling comfortable and having fun.. Her terms of fun, anyway!   
After the chanting was done, Bethany sat down on the floor, indicating us to follow her lead.   
She held out her hands, and begrudgingly we took them again.   
Jonas and I sat, glancing at each other awkwardly, wondering if this was the game what was the point of it all?   
We hadn't asked many questions about this so called game, infact we hadn't asked anything at all, we'd just gone along with whatever Bethany had placed infront of us.  
For a moment I considered asking what the hell this was all about, but it hardly seemed to matter at that point.   
What was done, was already done.   
\-  
I broke the silence after a few moments longer. I felt bad for Bethany not fitting in, but this was just getting ridiculous now.  
Giving alcohol to a recovering addict?  
Making us stand around and say nonsensical words over and over?  
I was tired, and thanks to Jonas mediocre cooking abilities, I was also starving.  
I was getting irritated. I'd had enough of this game.  
"Look, it's been fun and all, but I probably should get down to the shop before it closes. I'm all out of smokes."  
I pulled my hand out of hers, and stood, while Jonas mumbled something about a big day helping his dad tomorrow, he better be getting to bed himself. I heard his bedroom door clicking shut before I even had time to put my jacket on and do it up.   
Bethany didn't seem to mind, she watched and gave us both a sweet smile, and that was that.  
The game, whatever it was meant to be, was over.  
\-  
The fresh air on my face felt like a slap back to reality.  
I pulled my jacket hood up around my head, struggling to find warmth against the icy cold wind.  
The walk to the shop was quick, taking about 10 minutes at best.  
I usually enjoyed the late night stroll, but I wasn't feeling it tonight, I just wanted to get something greasy to fill my belly, and my smokes and go back to my warm, cozy bed.  
The shopkeeper greeted me by name, giving me a friendly wave as I stepped inside the convenience store.  
I was making my way back to the register, my hands full with extra snacks id picked up along my trawl down the isles, when I heard the shop door chime open again.  
I waited for the owners friendly hello, but it never came.   
Instead, there was a cry, a quick and sudden gasp.   
I paused, feeling my heart hammering in my chest. Something wasn't right.   
Without further thought, I dropped my groceries where I was standing and ran towards the front counter.   
The owner was cowering down, crying as he stumbled his way through pulling notes out of the cash register and stuffing them into a black backpack.   
A man with a balaclava stood there watching.  
I dont know how it happened, I've never been a fighter. I'm not trained in any self defence.   
It was over in what felt like a minute, somehow id managed to wrestle the gun off the dude in the balaclava, without even breaking a sweat.   
I aimed his own gun at him, with a confidence I never knew I possessed.   
"If you ever come here again, you won't be walking back out that door. Get out of here, before I call the police." inside I felt nauseated, shaky with anxiety but on the outside I was cool, calm, collected. My voice was strong, serious.   
The man ran, he did not look back.   
The owners sobs were louder now, his gratefulness so apparent. He gathered a bunch of notes to give them to me, but I shook my head. I grabbed a pack of cigarettes off the counter, flashed them at him as if to say that was all the payment I needed.   
"Look after yourself." I said, and I left.   
\-  
The walk home was more of a run.   
I was full of energy, almost buzzing with electricity it felt like.   
I couldn't wait to get home and tell Jonas about what had happened. I knew it was a crazy story, I could hardly even believe that it had happened and I was the one there,   
But Jonas was a good friend, he could tell when I was being truthful and when I wasn't.   
The front door was unlocked, but I wasn't surprised. In my haste to get out of the place I'd probably not even bothered to double check I'd locked it. Not that it mattered, apart from what had just transpired with the hold up at the convenience store, our neighborhood was generally pretty safe.  
I knew Jonas would probably be asleep by then, but I didn't care. I needed to tell him my story, i had literally saved the day, something I'd dreamt of doing since I was a little kid.   
I mean, who didn't want to be a hero, right?   
\-  
I knocked softly to start with, and then louder.   
I called out to let him know it was me, incase he thought it was Bethany and he was pretending to be deep asleep as if to ignore her.   
No repsonse came.   
I tried the handle, and it was unlocked.   
It felt wrong to let myself in to Jonas room, but my excitement overtook it and I found myself opening the door and stepping inside.   
I didn't know a human body could bend the way his was. In fact, I didn't actually know it was a human body.. Jonas body, for a moment to begin with.   
It was mangled, the only word I can think of to somehow explain the carnage. 

I opened my mouth to scream, but managed to stop myself before I made any noise.  
I stood silent and thought about what I didn't hear, and that was Bethany.  
With baited breath I made my way out of Jonas room and down the hallway towards her bedroom.  
I didn't knock, just turned the handle and let myself in, bracing for the scene I was expecting to see set out infront of me.  
But Bethany's bedroom was clean. There was no body, managed or otherwise, on her bed. Or anywhere else in the room, for that matter.  
I pulled my phone out of my jeans to call the police, tears forming in my eyes, as my reality slowly sunk in.   
My best friend was dead. And my other roommate was missing.  
As the call dialed, I noticed something on the printer of Bethanys computer desk.  
A single page, in what appeared to be freshly printed ink. The writing smudged when I touched it, smearing the start of the letter.   
I began to read.  
\-  
"Marc, I'm sorry.  
I guess that's how this letter should start, an apology and an explanation, of sorts.  
I heard about the game at work, and if you had of just listened when I explained it, you would of understood better what was going to happen.   
It wasn't meant to go like this though, it was supposed to be so different.  
The game, all that chanting and holding hands, well it was supposed to make our utmost desires come true.   
I've never told anyone, but I am failing in science and I just wanted to make my dream of being a marine biologist a reality..  
Instead, and regrettably, I found out that wasn't what my heart truly desired.   
I'm ashamed and humiliated to admit, I was the one who did that to Jonas, I was the one who.. hurt him. I suppose it turns out you weren't the only one who despised him cooking that awful lasagne every single week.   
I had to leave, I can't face going to jail, not for something that wasn't in my control.   
I swear.. It was like I had no idea what I was doing, it all just happened.   
I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I was really only trying to help when I suggested the game.  
I wish I knew more about how long this.. Curse or whatever is, will last. But the truth is I don't. I don't know if it's temporary, and we will go back to normal, and be in control of our actions.. I don't know Marc, it may be forever.   
I'm sorry.   
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.   
Bethany.   
\-  
The police are sending a car out and I don't know what's going to happen from here on out.   
I couldn't form words on the phone, I was too shocked at what I had read, my head was spinning remembering the way Jonas body has been splayed.. Trying to imagine that Bethany was responsible for that.. It was difficult.   
And also, for the fact my utmost desire had always been quite simple - I wanted to be a hero, I wanted to save the day.   
I hated Bethany for bringing the game to us, and I hated even more that I understood exactly what she meant.  
Same as me fighting off that would be robber, I had no idea what I was doing, it was just happening, and then it was done.  
The worst of it all, and I wish I could change this, I really do.. is that I feel an overpowering sense of protection towards Bethany.   
Part of me, the logical part, wants her to be punished, as I know she deserves to be.   
But I know that I won't be able to make myself tell the police the truth about what happened.   
Against my own will, as if being controlled by something else, I ripped up the letter she left, and flushed all the teeny, tiny pieces of paper down the toilet, crying as I watched evidence against her go down the literal drain.   
I truly can't imagine her going to jail for something that wasn't technically her fault.   
She's so smart, she's going to be a marine biologist one day.  
I guess my deepest desire is to protect the vulnerable, no matter the cost to myself.   
\-  
The police sirens are getting closer, I know there's not much time left where I'm a free man.   
I have already decided to admit to the murder of my friend, Jonas.   
It's my duty to be the hero in this situation.  
It's also my duty to try and help others, if I can..   
I want to warn others. Please, don't make the same mistakes as me.   
If someone wants to play a game with you, just take the damn time to understand what you're truly getting yourself into..  
Remember, one mistake could change your life.. Forever. And not for the best, either.   
As for me, I'm waiting, and I'm pondering.   
I wonder if I will like jail, if I will flourish in there.   
I think there will be a lot of people that will need protecting.   
Maybe it isn't going to be so bad, after all.
