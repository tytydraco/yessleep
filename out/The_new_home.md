I don't know how and why this happened, but what I know is that I'm probably always staying the same.

It all started with the new home.

_________________________________________

I'm already excited, my dad told me he's going to take me somewhere. When I saw what he meant I couldn't believe my eyes, it was a house! Not only were we waiting for the perfect new home but also couldn't afford actually owning one ourselves. We had had the idea of instead renting a house, because although finding a home was such a struggle we really needed it. We were a family of eight, but my big brother had already moved out (wich reminds me of the story of the eight orphans) and we needed alot more space than our current flat could offer. My little siblings, two sisters and one brother, the youngest, were always loud, it wouldn't have been all that bad if they were just happy energy bundles but instead they were always fighting, adding to the general fights that happened between our parents and between parent and child. But at least the fighting wasn't as bad as it was before my little brother and cat.

Still it was very draining, all those fights multiple times per day, there was always someone screaming and or crying in our home. The lacking space contributed alot to that as some could already know.

Besides that and the other problems every family struggles with, we were actually a pretty happy family, considering the circumstances of course. My parents both worked but still had the time to go out with us and care for us properly, even if it wasn't always easy. I kow that my parents made many mistakes in my time growing up, but I know that they hadn't had it easier when they were kids either.

But whom I especially loved was my little brother, Robin. I always wished to have a little brother, being sad and feeling empty seeing little boys with their moms and big sisters. But then it finally happened, I got a little brother! I swore to myself to cherish every little moment with him and give him all the love and care there is in this world. I wanted to shield him of all the bad and create a space for him where only happiness exists. 

But in the end I created something way less lovely. I never wanted the memories to fade and that's what I got. 

*I'm sorry Robin.*

When I saw the house I couldn't believe my eyes, I never knew my dad started building a house for us, I thought he didn't have the money. My second thought was that this was not enough space, why not build a big enough house if we're already at it anyway? But then I saw a staircase leading downstairs to another floor, where all the rooms were, I was so excited to have an own room, without having to share it with anyone!

Interrupting my little happy self being excited as a little girl in her birthday, I saw multiple construction  workers in the house working. I watched them build in an unnatural and immensly high speed, fascinated I watched them build a new staircase for the house, to my confusion a staircase leading to nowhere. My thought was that they're probably going to be done building our home in a few hours, I was happy that they had already built the main structure of the house and wondered how long it took them and how long it takes them to build a complete house from top to bottom on average. 

Maybe their fast work meant less working time, so less money. Maybe that was the reason my dad could suddenly afford a house after all those years.

_________________________________________

A few days after my dad had first shown us the new house we moved in, thanks to the construction workers. We all could eventually adjust to the new environment rather quickly.

One day I was outside playing with Robin, he showed me some kind of snail mixed with insect features. At the sight of this monstrosious thing I told him to put it away and upon asking why I told him because it was disgusting. He looked a little sad and maybe even disapponted.

A small way further away from us there was a girl, sitting like a resting monkey, Sasha. I knew Sasha, Sasha was bad. I must not let her destroy the happy world I've created with so much effort.
Sasha was a girl one year younger than me, underaged and smoking. She was known as a bad girl hanging out with bad people. I didn't want her to get in contact with my little siblings. Once I was told that my little sister was talking to her, I immediatly told her to stop and she did. I was just so scared of her destroying the happiness in my family and ultimately my world, wich was all that I had left. 

Then I saw it, a crack in the timeline.

My brother walked toward the crouching monkey. She looked at the creature in his  hand and started comforting him, telling him that everything in this world is beautiful, just because it is a part of it. I watched with a knot forming in my chest. I knew she was right, it just wasn't right hearing it out of her mouth, maybe If I had said that it would've made sense, but this just wasn't like her. I was mad, mad at my brother leaving me, mad at him leaving me for her, mad at Sasha for being there, for interrupting the order of my world, invading my world, even saying things I should've said.

Then she said, people who think otherwise are stupid, clearly hinting at me, smirking and giving me a triumphed look, another crack.

I told her "And that's gonna be me, isn't it?" with alot of annoyance in my voice.

I don't remember what happened next, I only remember that I was very mad and felt like she's taking something from me that belongs to me.

_________________________________________


Robin and I wanted to walk home and Sasha appeared next to us, seeming like she belonged to us, to our world. She didn't fit in and will never, still she walked the same way we were acting like it was normal to pretend like she was a part of us.

I didn't want her to be there, didn't want her touch anything, didn't want her to destroy anything. 

I wanted her to disappear.

And then it happened, I don't exactly know when and how, but all three of us didn't recognize the way anymore. We didn't know where we are walking to and where we came from, we didn't recognize the street right in front of us anymore.
It was strange.

We all knew something was wrong and that something had happened, that something was different. We asked where to walk now and decided to just keep walking the street in front of us straight ahead.

After a while I realized that Sasha was missing, since when I didn't. I was somehow a little worried, because maybe that meant that Robin and I might be in danger, maybe we would vanish too, not knowing where the other was. But at the same time I was somehow relieved that she had disappeared, now Robin and I where alone.

We kept walking for probably multiple months until we saw a clark watching us 'til finally talking to us and telling us that we are stuck in a time loop, We are stuck in time and won't grow older, no matter how much time has seemingly passed. I wondered if the only way out was how Sasha had gone, maybe she had found the way out?

_________________________________________

We are still in the loop not knowing when and if we're going to disappear like Sasha did and not knowing where this would lead us.

I now, after all this time, have realized that somehow there needed to be an open crack to the timeline and somehow we where at the wrong place at the wrong time and got stuck in it.

I remember the last thing the clark had told me: You know the way out.

I don't know what she meant by that, but this place kind of feels like we always belonged here.

This is our new home.
