My name is Josh. This happened to me in 2010, back when I had just started college. At the time, Instagram had just launched. It wasn’t the giant it is now back then, it was just a simple photo-sharing app that people were getting curious about. Everyone around campus was downloading it, trying it out, posting random shots of food or their dorms.

I’ll admit, I got hooked fast. I remember my first few pictures: the cafeteria food that looked like prison slop, a blurry selfie with my roommate Evan, even a dumb picture of my sneakers because “everyone was doing it.” It felt… fun. New. Like a digital photo album we could all carry in our pockets.

That’s when I got a notification that someone wanted to follow me.

Username: Norahanna-678.

I didn’t recognize the name. And back then, people didn’t really add strangers they just followed their friends. It was a little weird, but I thought maybe it was someone from class. So I accepted.

A few minutes later, I took a photo of myself in my dorm room mirror and sent it to her with the caption:

“Do I know you?”

Her reply came fast. A picture of a teddy bear, with the words:

“I know you.”

I didn’t think too much of it. Maybe she was being flirty. Maybe it was just a joke. I laughed it off and sent her another selfie, pulling a stupid face, writing: “You sure? lol”

She replied:

“You’re cute.”

For a while, it felt harmless. She’d comment nice things, send me emojis, or little random photos. A tree. A bird. Her shoes. I didn’t think much of it.

Until the next day.

I was sitting in the cafeteria scrolling through my phone when I got a new DM from her. Another picture.

But this one… was of me. Sitting in the cafeteria. In that exact moment.

My stomach dropped. I looked around. No one was pointing a phone at me, no one was laughing or whispering like it was a prank.

I messaged her immediately: “Who are you? Where are you?”

She answered almost instantly.

“I saw you.”

I typed back, fingers shaking: “Yeah, I know. Why didn’t you come up and talk to me then?”

Her response made my skin crawl:

“It was impossible. You’re just so cute.”

That night I confronted my friends, one by one, thinking it had to be one of them messing with me. But they all swore they had nothing to do with it. And they sounded genuine. Too genuine.

I should’ve blocked her then. But I didn’t.

Over the next week, her photos became constant. Not just one or two, dozens. Then hundreds. She’d send me pictures of myself in the library, in class, walking across campus, even sitting outside eating lunch. It was like she was everywhere at once.

The strangest part? Nobody else noticed. No one ever seemed to be taking pictures of me. And yet, every day, my inbox was flooded.

It only stopped when I ignored her completely.

That’s when the real nightmare began.

One night, I woke up at 4:45 a.m. to my phone buzzing nonstop. Over a thousand notifications. My DMs were full of pictures again.

Ten of them made my blood run cold.

They were of me. Sleeping.

The first was taken from across the room.
The next, closer.
Each photo crept nearer, until the last one was just my face my eyes shut, my mouth slightly open, the blanket pulled to my chest.

My roommate Evan was gone for the week, visiting family. I had locked the door before bed. And when I woke up, it was still locked from the inside.

I called the police right away.

They took it seriously at first. Looked through my phone. Interviewed people on my floor. But there was nothing to go on. No fingerprints. No signs of forced entry. No witnesses. After a few weeks, the case was closed for “lack of evidence.”

I blocked Norahanna-678. And like magic, the pictures stopped.

For fifteen years, I tried to convince myself it was over. I even let myself believe maybe it was some weird glitch, some insane prank I just never figured out. Life went on.

Until this morning.

I was sitting at my kitchen table, scrolling through the news, eating breakfast. That’s when my phone buzzed.

New message from: Norahanna-678.

I hadn’t seen that name in fifteen years.

Hands trembling, I opened the photo.

It was me. Eating breakfast.

Only… the picture was taken through the window right behind me.

I remember looking out that same window, just minutes before, and seeing nobody there. Not a soul.

The caption under the photo made my heart stop:

“You’re still so cute. I wanted to go in and talk to you. But it’s scary to talk to you during the day when you’re awake… See you tonight instead :)”

Im writing this now. Hopimg that if i die tonight, my story gets pushed out. Well, idk what to do now. But im getting kinda tired. Im probably gonna go to bed. Goodnight, sleep tight. Dont let the bedbugs bite.
