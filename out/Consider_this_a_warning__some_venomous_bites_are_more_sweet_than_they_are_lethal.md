There are women out there in the world—if you can even call them that—who carry something vile, something sinister deep beneath their surface. Something so toxic, yet enchanting. With a single touch, she will have you in her possession. No matter how much you fight it. Once her teeth pierce your flesh, you will have the same venom running through your veins, and every moment in which clarity is able to set in will burn like the fires of hell. Everybody who gets too close and is deemed controllable—some may call it desirable—is put under the poisonous spell of her bewitching touch.

Once enough of your own craving for her attention has numbed your senses, she will slowly reveal her real appearance. It is like nothing you have ever seen before. The silky fabric gliding over her porcelain skin will turn crude, vile—melting into the softness you first lost your thoughts in. The eyes, which shone like stars reflecting on the vast surface of the blue sea, will turn to the same black the abyssal deep carries. And you will lose yourself even more in them. She made sure you would. And once the delicate fingers of her small and feeble hands turn to razor-sharp claws, closing in around you and cementing the physical grasp she has on you, you will lose all hope.

But you won't know.

No.

Your longing for more of her sweet nectar flowing through your veins will turn your brain into that of an addict. Your intoxicated senses dull, but that won't matter to you anymore. She will sink her fangs deep into your willing flesh while you keep begging for more—losing yourself in the deep, dark eyes that see right through your very soul.

She won’t do it just for you. No. Everybody you know, love, or even hate will get a taste of her virulent effects. But that doesn't matter to you. Because you get the most of it. And while everybody around you will only—just barely—get to feel what you feel, will only be put under her spell enough for it to show its sinister effect, she will pump you full of it.

But slowly—ever so slowly—she will get rid of you. You won't know when it happens, or how. The signs will be there, and they will be clear. To anyone but you. Because your mind starts ignoring them. Because you are still under the spell. You are an addict. And you are longing for it. For her.

But she will start to give you less and less of what you want—of what you need—because she has already found her next victim to prey on but keeps it hidden from you. Whenever she isn't around, you will feel the haze in your mind clear up. And what hits you won't be salvation, or the sweet feeling of being freed from the claws that drag through your physical being.

No.

It will be realization. You will realize that you can't bear to live without it anymore—without her anymore. And those moments will hurt. It will be the most pain you have ever felt.

So you try to find out as much as you can about who she is replacing you with. Whenever she is graceful enough to let you still the hunger inside you, you will savor it like it is the last time you will ever get a taste of that noxious touch. Oh, that sweet embrace—the same embrace she is granting others now. Because you aren't her favorite anymore.

No.

She will be giving you less and less, while her new favorite prey floats in the same saccharine cloud she once put you in. And you can’t do anything about it. You won’t do anything about it. Nobody will.

The only thing that is sure to happen is that you will lose everything and everyone. Because once the haze that blinds your mind clears up more, she will dispose of you. She won’t do it harmfully.

No.

You will do the harm yourself. She will deceive you—maybe for years—before she finally gets rid of you. She throws you away and lets her new favorite victim leech off her glorious toxins.

And you will be alone. No one will believe you. Everybody around you will still be under her spell, enchanted by her appearance. But they will not have seen what you have. They will never see the crooked frame you still run after.

Because you will still want to get her back. Because you're an addict.

The following weeks or months will be tough for you. You will often wake up late at night, while the moon softly illuminates your vacant bedroom, and believe that you see her. In the corner of your room—her black, soulless eyes glued right to your sweating body—before she vanishes shortly after. During those nights, sleep won't find you. Instead, you will slump through the streets, all the way to her domain, to look through the windows into the lit-up rooms. And you will see her—letting the sweet salvation you crave slowly intoxicate her new favorite toy. Jealousy will flood your veins and numb your mind. After all, this should be you. Because you want it. Because you need it. Because you're an addict.

One day, she will reach out to you. You won't know why, and she will never tell you. All you will be able to believe and tell yourself is that she wants you back the same way you crave her venomous touch.

But she doesn’t.

No.

She will only give you another small dosage of your fix to still your hunger before leaving you all alone again. And she will keep doing that for months—maybe years—while trapping you in this sinister circle of constantly reminding you of your addiction and devotion to her.

Someday you might seek help. Meet people who never came in contact with her deceiving poison. And that might help—but your life will never be the same. Because nightmares will haunt you. She will haunt you in your dreams, and you will have to stay strong. You will have to stay strong enough to stay away from her, as you have with the help of the others.

But one day, you will surely break. The same way I'm breaking as I write down these words.

It has been four years since she got rid of me, and for almost three years I've been in rehab from the intoxicating touch of her. I have been able to block off every attempt she made to contact me—all because of the people who know what happened and who are kind enough to help. But none of them are her. And during these past few nights, I could feel her. I could hear her clearly whispering in my ear. And now there is adrenaline ripping apart my body, and I can't resist anymore.

Is this what relapsing feels like?

I will get in my car and go to her as fast as possible. It doesn't really matter anymore.

I'm an addict.

And this will probably be the last thing you or anyone will ever hear from me.

Because today, I plan to drown in that sweet, sweet poison.
