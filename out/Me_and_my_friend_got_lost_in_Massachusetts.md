As the title says: I and my friend got lost in Massachusetts. We’re both MIT students and have known each other since freshman year of high school. I’m going into a shit ton of majors and minors and he’s going into mathematics with a major in physics. We’re both in this college because we worked our asses off and gained a bunch of scholarships from all around the country (the one thing decent in America) and we’re not planning on dropping out, especially the companion in this story: we’ll call him T.

T is a stubborn lad. Loves music, hates everyone but his friends, and would rather die than vote. He’s a staggering 5’9”, black, and he never backs down from a fight. He’s won so many bar fights he could’ve won the WWE championship without competing in it. In summary: T kicks ass. 

Now let’s look at me: I’m 6’2”, Asian, male, dyed green hair, love cars, and would rather die than be in a fight. Despite my height I’m not muscular,  and I’d rather spend my days rotting away in the chess hall than be in an argument. I’m the virgin, T is the gigachad.

So we’re on our way to this lovely vacation spot on the outskirts of Massachusetts, we’re on the highway and we’re pulling into the far right lane to go into the next exit. T is looking at the GPS and tells me to turn onto Exit 60. I look at him for a moment, I’ve never heard of Exit 60.

“Says it right here on the GPS,” T said, “should be coming up now.”

I look forward and, lo and behold, there it is: Exit 60.

I felt strange in that moment; why have I never seen this before? Before that moment I had never seen an Exit 60 on this highway. But I listened to the short king in the passenger seat and turned onto Exit 60, which curved down into a thick pine forest.

For several miles we traveled along the road past Exit 60, surrounded by the tall pines lining the road. It wasn’t until about 4-7 miles into the road that I noticed something, we hadn’t passed nor come up to a single car. Weirdest of all T hadn’t said a single word in several minutes. I glanced over to check on my friend.

T was pale, his eyes glued to his GPS screen, and his hands shaking. I looked at him in surprise.

“You okay, dude? You don’t look too well—you need me to pull over?”

T slowly looked at me, and then slowly lifted his GPS so I could see the screen.

My jaw dropped. Our road wasn’t on the map. According to the GPS we were driving straight through solid green.

I quickly pulled over the car and grabbed T’s GPS.

“This isn’t right,” I said, “there should be road here!”

“No shit, Sherlock,” T said, panicking, “the road just disappeared from the GPS!”

“What about the exit we took? Is that still there?”

I scrolled towards the highway we exited from, and I almost dropped the GPS. Exit 60 was gone, there was nothing there. 

I wasted no time. I yanked on my Lincoln’s automatic and flew the car into reverse, whipping around and careening the opposite direction. I remember thinking that there was no way Exit 60 and the road we’re driving on didn’t exist, maybe the GPS was busted and Exit 60 did exist.

We drove 2 miles…4 miles…5 miles…6 miles… one more mile until the truth…

…7 miles…

8 miles.

I stomped on the breaks and flung us both forward.

“What the fuck, D?!” T shouted, “I could’ve gotten a goddamn concussion—what the hell is wrong—”

“Shhhh,” I said, “look.”

The highway was gone, and with my guidance T noticed it, too. T cursed under his breath.

“Did you take a wrong turn?” T asked,

I looked at him and shook my head. The road was straight for as far as the eye could see. No turns, no curves, just straight road.

“Where’s the highway, then?!” T asked, panicking more,

“I have no goddamn idea,” I said as I took out the GPS.

This was getting too weird. According to the GPS there was no highway, it was just a blob of green now. 

“We’re lost, aren’t we?” T said, huffing,

“Hold on, now,” I began, “maybe we did take a wrong turn. Let’s go forward and see where this takes us.”

We drove for hours along the road, nothing but pines and asphalt for miles. That’s when I noticed my gas gauge wasn’t moving. With how much we were driving we should’ve gotten about halfway through the tank, but the needle was still at about 80% gas.

I thought the needle was broken, maybe an error with the system, but then I remembered I got my car checked out three days before we began this trip. How could the mechanic have not seen the gauge needle broken? 

“Did you hear that?” T suddenly spoke up,

“No?” I replied, confused,

T always had good ears. No matter how hard you sideswiped him his hearing remained keen. He always wore protection earmuffs in the labs and never had his music too loud.

“Sounded like a thump,” T said, “you sure your car is good?”

“Definitely,” I replied, “got it checked out a few days ago before the trip.”

I heard a thumping noise. It sounded echoey, like it wasn’t from the car but from outside. The trees looked taller now, but that had to be from my perception changed by exhaustion.

“Dude, do the trees look bigger to you?” I questioned, still driving,

“Yeah, that’s weird as hell.”

“So it’s not just me, then. Great.”

The thumping noise came back, this time louder, and it began appearing rhythmically, like drums or footsteps.

“Dude, I think the car is outta whack—”

“Drive.”

“What?” I asked, confused,

“Drive! Now!” T replied, practically yelling at me. The thumps we’re getting faster and louder.

I happened to look in my rear view mirror at that moment. My heart stopped for a second. Something was behind us, but we couldn’t make it out. It was huge, indescribable, and approaching fast.

I wasted no more time. I drove my foot into the gas pedal and sped down the road. I don’t remember much after seeing that thing but I remember enough; screaming, T crying, at one point that monster got so close we could hear it’s roaring cries that sounded like slowed baby wails. My car was speeding down the road at top speed, but it didn’t feel like enough. I remember screaming at my car to go faster, and I remember T starting to snot cry, the first time that man ever did in his life.

I felt like I was going to die.

Suddenly, in the far distance, we saw it: an upwards curve in the road. I remember how I pointed it out and almost dropped speed from how relieved I was. T was scream crying for me to speed up, and I remember screaming back that we were going to make it. That thing was still behind us, and it’s roars grew much louder and it’s thumps more desperate. It was closing the gap fast.

Then the thumps stopped. The roars stopped.

It was so sudden it was like someone just paused a video. I looked in my rear view mirror; the monster was gone. Completely gone without a trace. The curve was just a quarter of a mile away, and I managed to slow down in order to make the turn.

Just like that we were back on the highway. We skidded to a stop on the side of the highway, it was a miracle no one hit us when we entered.

Me and T sat there for what felt like hours, panting and looking at each other. Suddenly, T smiled.

“Holy shit, dude,” he said, panting, “what the hell just happened?”

Out of nowhere, I began chuckling, “I have no clue.”

We both began laughing, relieved to have escaped whatever the hell we just went through. We stopped laughing after a bit and I was preparing to restart the car when a State Patrol officer pulled over in front of us and got out of his car, approaching us.

I rolled down my window as he stopped at it.

“You two kids alright?” The officer inquired with a strange, thick Australian accent, “You look like you’ve just seen Satan himself!”

“Officer,” I said, “you have no idea.”

“Saw you pulled over and thought you needed some assistance. Need a lift?”

“We’re good, officer,” I replied, “you know where the nearest motel is?”

The officer pointed down the highway, “Just a few miles down ‘ere and take a left at the intersection.”

“Thanks.”

“No problem.”

The officer walked back to his patrol car. As stepped inside I noticed something: his car’s patrol number.

Massachusetts State Patrol No. 060.

I will never truly understand what happened that day, nor will I ever really explain the chills I got from seeing that patrol number, but I can explain this: never drive down an Exit you don’t remember being on a highway, especially if it’s labeled Exit 60.
