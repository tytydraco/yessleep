Hi. I’ve never posted here before, so I apologise for anything I might do or say incorrectly. Also, this story might be a bit long. I’m sorry.

My name is Sawyer Jackson. I’m 22 years old, and I have a twin sister. Her name is Roxanne. 
Roxanne and I grew up wealthy. I mean really wealthy. We got everything we wanted as kids, and that got to my sister’s head. She became spoiled, narcissistic, and entitled. She was violent, too. She often took her anger out on our younger sister, Emilia.
Roxanne was punished for this, obviously, but she never really cared. She never cared about anything or anyone but herself.

Until she met Zane Hargreeves. 

We live in a small town, everyone knows everyone. We met Zane when we were fourteen. He moved here with his parents and younger sister. Zane was our age, so our mother encouraged us to visit the family when they moved in, in hopes that we would become friends. 
Something changed in Roxanne when she saw Zane for the first time. He was tall for his age, he was sweet, funny, and even I had to admit that when the light danced off his pale blonde hair, he looked almost angelic. 

Zane and his sister Elizabeth were eager to join our group of friends. There were five of us until that point. Myself, Roxanne, and our friends Lucas, Alec, and Kyran, my boyfriend.
Alec and Zane really clicked. They became best friends within a matter of weeks, and they were inseparable. They still are.

A few months after the Hargreeves’ moved in, their father died. Roxanne took this opportunity to latch onto Zane. For nearly two years after that day, she hardly ever left his side. She would constantly be on the phone to him, late into the night. Zane often described Roxanne as “his rock”. 

After a while, they started dating. They were quite possibly the happiest teenage couple I had ever seen. Happier than my boyfriend and I were, but that’s a story for later. 
Everything was fine until they unexpectedly broke up right before sophomore year started. They had been together for a little over a year. 
I wasn’t surprised. They were both only 16, and I hadn’t expected them to get married or anything. But Roxanne was devastated. What freaked me out most about the situation, was when I saw Roxanne’s diary.

She had printed out every single photo Zane had posted to his social medias with his new girlfriend, cut her out, and pasted photos of herself as a replacement. 

Obviously concerned, I confronted Roxanne about this. She flew into a rage. She kept screaming at me, so distraught that I could only make out a few words.

“That bitch. That Jones bitch- She stole him from me. That fucking whore- I’ll kill her.”

I chalked it up to her just being upset. She was always overdramatic. I tried to reassure her that there would be more guys in the future, and that she shouldn’t be so hung up on Zane.
It was no use. 

For the next month, Roxanne went straight to her room after school, she would have her meals left outside on a tray, and she would keep the door locked at all times. Our rooms shared a wall, and I was often kept awake by her muffled shouting into the phone. 

Then, in December of that year, she knocked on my bedroom door. I opened it, and Roxanne stood there, holding her phone.

“Hey, Sawyer. Did you get an invite too ?”

She shoved her phone in my face. I read the text message on screen.

“Hey ! You’re invited to Melissa Jones’ Sweet Sixteen !
December 19th in the sports stadium off Main Street - 7pm !
Hope you can make it ! 
Xoxo
-Melissa”

I shrugged. “Probably. Let me check.”

I grabbed my phone from my bedside table, and scrolled through it, finding the same message. I showed it to Roxanne.

“Sweet.” She said with a smile. “You’re coming with me, then ?”.

I raised an eyebrow, confused. 

“I thought you hated her ? Won’t it be weird seeing her and Zane-“

“Ah.” She cut me off. “That’s in the past, Melissa and I are cool now.”

“Huh. Okay.” I replied.

Roxanne smiled, and returned to her room.

We arrived at the venue at around 7. Melissa’s parents had rented out the entire stadium for the night. I noticed that the forest surrounding the stadium looked almost like a painting, covered in blankets of snow as far as I could see. 

At about 2:30, almost all of the guests had left, including Roxanne. The place was a mess. We had mostly stayed in a lounge and the surrounding corridors, and I felt bad leaving the employees to clean up the next day. I spent the next hour cleaning up everything I could see.

When I was done, I finally took in my surroundings. I was completely alone. The lounge was empty. The hallways were empty. Everywhere was empty. The only sound I could hear was the faint hum of music coming from a dying speaker, and my own heartbeat. It freaked me out. 
I decided to step outside. I grabbed my coat from a nearby couch, opened the door, and stepped outside.

It was a cold, still night with a dark and cloudy sky that lay overhead. The ground lay soft with snow covering it with a haunting glow. The moonlight reflected off it and gave it an almost artificial quality. I had never seen anything quite as breathtaking in my life.

A stark silence enveloped the winter air, the kind that seems to amplify the smallest of sounds—a distant crow's caw, the subtle crackle of frozen branches. The snow blanketed the world in a deceptive calm. It was in this stillness that I saw it. A figure, surrounded by a dark crimson pool, lay motionless. 

It was Melissa.

Breath caught in my throat, I approached her, in shock. The cold seemed to intensify, biting at my exposed skin, as if nature itself recoiled from the scene before me. Her body was contorted, her features pallid and still, her eyes widened in a desperate plea for mercy. Those eyes will haunt me for the rest of my life.

In the moments that followed, time seemed to fracture. I fumbled for my phone, my fingers numb and uncooperative. The screen lit up, I squinted as I dialed 9-1-1. My voice was a hoarse whisper, as I described what I saw. Instructions were given, stay with the body, help is on the way, and all I could do was obey.
Finally, the police arrived. They searched the premises, and found Zane barricaded in a storage closet. He had blood on his hands, and was staring at the blood, motionless. He refused to talk, and they arrested him.

The next 72 hours were a blur. Police interviews, grief counselling, rumours about who did it and if it’s a serial killer. Everyone’s entire world had come crashing down in just one night. 

Zane eventually calmed himself down just enough to tell the police what he saw. Apparently, he and Melissa wanted to build a snowman, and Zane went into the forest to get some sticks. When he came back, she was dead in the snow. They released him from police custody after a few days, but nobody knows why. People theorised that his family had bribed the police to let him go, but the rumours died down eventually.

Then, there was the funeral. The church couldn’t fit everyone in attendance, and some people had to stand outside. 
This is when Roxanne saw her chance to get back into Zane’s life.
She became a shoulder to cry on again. She called him every night, and stayed on the phone to him for hours upon hours. They were friends again.

Zane eventually got over Melissa’s death. And he dated again, and again. Every time, the girl would be removed from his life. One girl moved away with no explanation, another killed herself, one was arrested, and the fourth one seemingly died in a freak accident.
People began to be wary of Zane. They thought he was behind all of this. Even though he was proven innocent in Melissa’s murder, no one would go near him, except for our friend group, and of course, Roxanne. 
Eventually, right before senior year, they got back together. And they haven’t broken up. 

So, I guess the question is, why am I so concerned about this now ? It all happened years ago. Why am I bringing it up when I have a child to raise and bills to pay ? 

I found something in the attic of our family home. 

I was looking for old toys that I could give to my daughter, Jessica. Her fourth birthday is coming up, and I want to give her something with sentimental value. 
While I was looking through boxes, I found Roxanne’s old yearbook. I decided to flip through it, for the nostalgia. 

What I saw in the pages sent shivers down my spine.

Paragraphs upon paragraphs of hateful, despicable language, aimed at five girls. Zane’s ex girlfriends. Each of their photos was crossed out, along with how they left Zane’s life. 

It got worse.

I noticed that in that same box, there was a knife. A hunting knife, along with bleach, hydrogen peroxide, rope, rat poison, and a map along with a set of keys to the local stadium. 

I felt sick to my stomach. I knew my sister wasn’t exactly a good person but was she really capable of murder ? I didn’t know what to do. I shoved everything back in the box, sat down in my childhood bedroom, and started typing this out.

I don’t know what to do. I could be wrong about all of this, it could all be a misunderstanding. My sister couldn’t kill someone. She wouldn’t. She wouldn’t ruin so many lives for the sake of one guy. Would she ?
What should I do ? Do I tell Zane ? Do I tell my husband ? Do I tell anyone ? Should I just confront Roxanne so she can explain that there’s a logical reason behind all of this ? 

Please give me advice.
