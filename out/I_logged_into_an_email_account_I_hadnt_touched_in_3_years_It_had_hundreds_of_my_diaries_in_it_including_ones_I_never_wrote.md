Since I came to Australia, I’ve kept a habit of writing a diary every day. I usually write it as an email, sending it to myself. At first, I used a 163 email account, but at the end of 2022, after I lost my Chinese SIM card when I changed my phone, I couldn’t log into my 163 account for a long time. Naturally, I switched to Gmail for my diaries.

At the end of 2024, after many years, I finally went back to China for the Spring Festival. One day, while writing my diary, I suddenly wondered—would the me from a few years ago have different feelings, thoughts, or some funny little things I had recorded? So I logged into my long-forgotten 163 mailbox. I was ready to scroll through piles of spam to find my old diaries when the very first email in my inbox froze me in place.

It was “my” diary.  
Dated 09/01/2025.

That was the exact date of my last diary entry before I flew back to China for vacation—the one I had sent from my Gmail account. I couldn’t understand why it was in this mailbox I hadn’t logged into for three years. I scrolled down. There were more diaries—many of them—appearing here throughout the three years I never used this account.

A chill ran down my spine. Southern China’s winter isn’t very cold, but right then my hair stood on end, my left eyelid twitched violently, and the moonlight outside felt sharp and merciless. I turned on the TV to drown out the suffocating silence, even though I didn’t care about the boring program. I vaguely remember it was a news report about a missing person in the city.

I forced myself to calm down. I scrolled further and opened the earliest of those impossible diary entries. The content was identical to what I had sent from Gmail—I wrote about how happy I was with my new phone, having switched from the clunky Samsung Fold5 to the newest iPhone. I also complained about the inconvenience of losing my Chinese SIM card, the difficulty of logging into WeChat, and some pretentious ramblings—something most of my diaries have. I compared the 163 and Gmail versions line by line. They were exactly the same.

I let out a sigh of relief, convincing myself that maybe somehow the two emails had been linked, and that was why this mailbox also received my diaries. Of course, that explanation didn’t make much sense—ignoring whether such a link was even possible, the diary here was sent *from* my 163 account, even though I had sent it *from Gmail*. But I didn’t think about it too hard. I used clumsy self-deception to seal the thought away.

I didn't bother to write a diary that night and directly went to bed. The news was still talking about missing persons, though officials said they hadn’t confirmed any connection to an organization yet. It seemed the government was taking it seriously.

I fell asleep quickly, but not peacefully. I knew I was lying to myself—*this is impossible*. I remember muttering that line in my dream, then suddenly my eyes snapped open. I wasn’t even sure if I had been asleep at all.

Around 2 or 3 a.m., the street outside was dead silent. My parents were staying at a relative’s house. Moonlight leaked faintly through the curtains, cold and pale. By the time I realized it, I was already sitting in front of my computer, logged into my 163 account, opening diary after diary, looking for… something.

The first sign of real wrongness came in the third month of these impossible entries. “I” mentioned a religion called **Asgol-Heshg**, which had been spreading across Australia and other Western countries. “I” didn’t write much about it—just said I had seen a post about it on Xiaohongshu(a Chinese social media), and even joked about it by comparing it to Falun Gong, saying Chinese people wouldn’t fall for such a thing.

Goosebumps rose on my arms. I had no memory of this. I Googled the name. No results. Nothing.

I kept reading. For a long while, things were uneventful. Then, over a month later, “I” mentioned **Asgol-Heshg** again—this time saying it was growing rapidly, with more and more converts, and that every weekend there were gatherings of believers in front of Sydney Town Hall. “I” even described its symbol: a solemn, inverted vessel, carved with a single downward-looking eye.

I had no idea what an “inverted vessel” was supposed to be. My mind went blank. This wasn’t written by me. Why was it here?

As the entries went on, they became filled with details about **Asgol-Heshg**—its doctrines, its expansion, its faith. “I” started attending their events. “I” grew more and more fanatical. “I” loved *It*, though I didn’t know what *It* was. The diaries stopped mentioning daily life or my pretentious little laments. All that remained was obsession. “I” wrote about carving the downward-looking eye into my own arm with an art knife, to punish myself for my initial disrespect.

My hands were shaking so hard I could barely hold the mouse. Sweat beaded on my forehead. I accidentally closed the page.

“Fuck…” I muttered.

When I reopened my browser, I saw that my earlier Google search for **Asgol-Heshg** had automatically refreshed. The results were completely different from before:

This wasn’t what I saw before. Earlier, there had been *nothing*.

I didn’t know how much more I could take. I opened my 163 account again and kept reading. I didn’t have the strength to read carefully; I just skimmed. The diary’s “owner”—I no longer wanted to call them *me*, even in quotes—wrote in detail about their atrocities, believing they could please the Inverted Vessel and reach “the best conclusion.” I didn’t understand what that meant.

Finally, I opened the very last diary.

It said everything was set. The Vessel was satisfied. A messenger would come, after everything was revealed, to lead “me” to the best conclusion.

Revealed? Revealed what? I wanted to ask.

The TV was still on. The news was reporting another missing persons case, saying it was likely connected to the **Asgol-Heshg** cult.

Then I heard a knock at the window.

The moonlight dimmed.

I think this will be my last diary.
