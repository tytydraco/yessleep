The rain smacked against the windshield of Bion’s car. The headlights just barely managed to illuminate the surroundings of the road. Off in the distance, the glow of a city can be seen through the rain on the horizon.  The road that Bion feels he has been on for hours finally departs from the forest and enters a small clearing before making its way onto a bridge comparable to that of the Golden Gate Bridge. While normally quite an impressive sight, the atmosphere created by the rain kept Bion on edge. Bion turns down the local radio station just as a whip of lightning cracks through the night sky illuminating the bridge and exposing the shadow of a man holding onto the side rail facing away from the bridge preparing to jump.  
The sight caused Bion to panic almost causing him to lose control of his vehicle, however he managed to take control and pull over to confront the man. Bion slipped on the asphalt when he leaped from the door of his car. He broke out into a full-on sprint towards the man grabbing his arm and tightly squeezing it.  
“Hey, man! What’s going on here” Bion exclaims a mix of panic and fear stirring in his voice.   
“You wouldn’t understand man, nobody can ever understand” the man snaps back at Bion.   
Bion’s face contorts as he tries to quickly muster up a calm response. “Come on man, maybe I could, what’s your name, I’m Bion” his voice becomes surprisingly calming despite the situation.  
“I’m Claeg, please just get out of here.” Claeg is practically screaming the rain is streaming down his face. “This is what I have to do, please just let me”.  
“Why do you have to, there are always better things” Bion remains calm despite how bleak this situation might be.  
“I have no one, there is no one for me to turn to” Claeg’s voice trembles as he speaks. “I have pushed away everyone who has ever cared for me” Claeg’s voice begins cracking. “Now I have no one because I shut everyone out” Claeg begins to sob.  
Bion quickly retaliates with “You still here, you still have yourself”.  
Claeg in a somber tone responds, “But nobody cares for me, including myself.” Claeg pauses for a moment. Giving both men some time to think through all that has happened so far. Only five minutes have passed since Bion got out of his car, but it has felt like hours. Claeg begins to softly speak. “I was evicted three weeks ago” his voice stumbles. “I have been homeless for three weeks, and I can’t tell anyone, because anyone I could tell lost hope for me long ago” Claeg begins to lean away from the bridge, holding his body above the black void below.  
“Look man, just breath, I’m sure somebody in your life is willing to help you out.” Bion’s heart begins to race as he realizes Claeg’s about to jump. “And if no one is I’ll help you out” Bion stumbles over his words. He is trying to get a grip on Claeg so that if he does jump, he won’t fall.  
“The second I stepped on this bridge was when I became a Deadman” Claeg’s voice is eerily calm as his mind is made up about what must happen.   
“You appear alive to me!’ the joke falls on death's ears. “Come on, I’ll bring you to a dinner get you a warm meal right now!” Bion begins to plead. “Just one meal, then you can return here.”  
“I’m sorry man” Claeg whispers before letting go of the rail. Bion tries to tighten his grip even more once he realizes what has happened, but it was too late. Bion’s hand slipped off Claeg’s arm causing him to begin a descent into darkness. Bion’s world shrunk down to his stomach as he collapsed against the railing. He just watched a man die, he wants to just sit and take a break but the rain keeps falling.
