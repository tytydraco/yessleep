Hello Everyone my name is Jake James but I prefer JJ. Either way I am writing to you here today because I think im going to die and I need your advice on what to do. I should start by telling you that I am writing this from a small library i found open late to the public.

My childhood imaginary friend is going to kill me. This i know for a fact.

This all started way back in the early 2000s. I was 5 or 6 years old when I started a friendship with my imaginary friend Mick. 

Mick was my very best friend when I was little as my family lived in a small 2 bedroom shack in Louisiana deep in the woods. My mother was a teacher way back in the day but she quit when she got pregnant with my older brother Stan.

My father was a deckhand on a shrimp boat and he was gone alot of the time with work.

My mother home schooled us which meant we didn't have much of a chance in making friends so my brother was all that I had. That is until the day I met Mick. 

Mick was a small boy just as I was and he had shaggy light blonde hair and wore a bright yellow shirt with Jean shorts and white sneakers. I was the only one that could see Mick and he was always at my side. 

We would play all of our fun made up games from sun up to sun down. We threw rocks that skipped across the glass like water surface at the river and had make believe sword fights with sticks We found in the woods. 

I recall having conversations with Mick all the time.

We were sitting on a few big rocks near the river when Mick asked"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

"I think I want to be a pilot some day!" I responded gleefully I looked over at Mick and asked him the same question

"I just hope I'm still your bestest friend when I grow up!" Mick responded shooting me a look with an almost too wide smile.

"ME too Mick, ME too!" I responded before giving him a slight slap on the back and yelling "TAG, YOU'RE IT" and running through the swampy woods that surrounded our house. 

My mother was an angel but was always strict when she spoke to me about Mick telling me "listen hun I understand that things can get lonely out here but you need to stay focused on reality. Mick is not a real boy and you need to stop pretending that he is!" 

The words my mother spoke were harsh but they only bothered me a little bit. Mick however was always very upset when he overheard them. He would yell and slam his fist into the ground before saying "I AM REAL" and "You're mom is just a stupid grown up! She doesn't even remember what it was like to be a kid!" 

His actions made me feel uneasy and nervous but Mick would always calm himself down and apologize for his outbursts when he had seen my reaction. 

One day my brother Stan and I were in the woods playing in the tree fort that we had put together with some old pallets and fallen logs we found. We were pretending to be soldiers fighting off bad guys at every angle with large sticks as RPGs and smaller sticks as rifles. 

We had just finished up acting out the brave scene full of heroics when a blood curdling scream boomed across the woods and bounced between the soggy tree stumps.

Stan and I were frozen in shock at the sound that filled our little fort with terror. We heard it again this time the scream was followed with the voice of our mother begging for her life. 

In a dread filled voice she screamed "WHO ARE YOU?, NO ,  NO YOU'RE NOT REAL!  GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!"

It is still impossible to this day to express the feelings that whirled through my veins and up into the tears that involuntarily began careening down my face. 

Stan was only 5 years older than me but he was so much braver of a kid than I was. He sprung into action at the sound of the second scream.

"JJ I need you to run to the neighbors and tell them something bad is happening and you need the cops okay?" Stan said while holding my shoulders and demanding my attention.

"What, what's wrong with mommy?" I shrieked from within my shivering body.

"Something bad J you need to go now!" Stan shouted as he turned me in the direction of the neighbors, pointed and gave me a small shove before he took off running in the direction of our house.

I froze there watching my brother disappear and then reappear amongst the trees before ultimately leaving my sight all together. 

I finally found the courage to unbind my feet from their resting spots and ran in the direction I believed Stan had pointed me in. 

My feet felt like I was carrying large stones around my ankles and my back muscles hurt from how hard I was trying to move my little legs. 

The smell of rotting wood and musty fungus filled my lungs as I climbed onto and over fallen moss covered logs. The muck from the floor of the woods clung to my white shoes as though it were hands reaching out to stop me on my mission. 

I took several missteps and fell a few times on my way cutting my arms and scraping my knees. At one point I recall looking over to my side and seeing Mick standing there amongst the trees watching me attempt to stand back up from a hard fall. I remember thinking about the fact that my best friend wasn't offering me help in any way.

The run felt like an eternity but I finally made it to my neighbors home. Passing the edge of the treeline I could see an older man in blue overalls sitting in his rocking chair on his front porch. He had a guitar in his hands and there was an old dog laying at his feet. 

"HE..HELP SOMETHING BAD HAPPEND TO MOMMY!" I screamed at the old man who quickly set his guitar aside and flew from his chair to meet me in the driveway. 

Having been so exhausted from the long run I fell to my knees just before he reached me and I remember the feeling of the large gravel rocks slicing through the skin. I wanted to yell out in pain but failed to do so, falling tears and gasps for air in my burning lungs was all I could muster.

The old man embraced me and lifted me to my feet demanding answers and retrieving his phone from his overall pocket.

That is when I looked back into the treeline and my eyes studied the woods. Darting from tree to tree and finally coming to rest on a sight that still chills me as I write this. There standing in the swampy woods was my best friend Mick.

Our eyes met and the realization struck me like a truck. Mick was standing there smiling, a wide stretching row of sharp teeth was uncovered from beneath his pale lips.

The police arrived at our small shack to the sight of true horror. My mother had been delt a gruesome death. Her body had been ripped to shreds and her tongue had been ripped from her mouth. 

I read the autopsy report when I was a teen and it was said to have been "bitten off or cut with a jagged object" and that her tongue was not located at the scene. 

That day was unbelievably difficult to manage. I remembered that day as the one in which I lost my mother and my very best friend.

My father had to quit his Job on the boats and return home. He was different than I remembered. After my mom died he was harsh and bitter all the time. 

He began drinking and doing drugs with what small amount of money he could bring in. He struggled to put food on the table and keep even the small shack as a place for us to live. 

It was a harsh few years that we spent living that way. My father became physically abusive and began slapping my brother and I when he was angry. I can still feel the welts he left on my face as I type this out. 

When I was 10 years old Stan ran away. He left me a small note under my pillow and told me where to find him when I left some day.

I awoke that morning to the sound of my father throwing things around the house and swearing. I could feel the slams of his feet through my small wire framed bed as he stomped. 

He swung open my door and in a deep bitter tone he said "Living room NOW!" and slammed the door behind him.

Climbing out of bed and walking past my door I was met with the smell of alcohol so strong that it burned my eyes. It wafted around the room clinging to the air. And the sights of upturned furniture and shattered glass came into view.

"Where is your brother you little shit? Hmm? You tell me RIGHT NOW!" he exclaimed from the opposite side of the living room. He was sitting sprawled on top of our old couch. 

"I...I don't know. Maybe he went to school, or maybe he.." my fumbling words were cut off by his sudden jolt from the couch and into the few stale inches of space between my face and my words. 

"Maybe isn't good enough JJ! Use your brain!" he said in a hateful manner. The alcohol that slid off of his words and flew into my nose disgusted me and I turned my head away to flee them. My dad grabbed the collar of my small shirt and yanked me back to him causing a small tearing sound in my shirt. 

"DO not fucking turn away from me!" he said

"Yes sir" I managed to mutter through my shaking lips and tears. "I don't know where he went I promise"

A look of disgust slid to his face and he spat "well what the fuck good are you then" before throwing my collar from his hand and returning to the couch.

Life for me became almost unbearable now. I was left there to face all of his rage and abuse alone. I had to face what I thought at the time were the darkest days of my life now without my mom , my brother and Mick. 

After my mother died Stan and I were enrolled in a crappy public school that we both hated. We missed the days of our mother waking us up with her beautiful singing and the smell of a warm breakfast lingering in the air. We missed her history lessons where she sat and read fantastic stories of places far away. We missed her kind words and warm embrace when things were bad. And now I was there missing all of that alone.

  I missed my brother with all my heart but I was hopeful he had a safe place to be away from this hell. 

  I began drawing pictures of Mick again, hiding them under my bed from my father and thinking about how fun life use to be when we pretended to be swashbuckling pirates or safari explorers searching for gold. I missed having a companion and someone to talk to. 

  As I slept at night I prayed for his return and I begged whatever God may be listening to bring my wish to life. I spent another two long years in that house with my father.

One day while walking home down our long driveway surrounded by trees I looked up from my feet and the sight I found had stopped me in my tracks. 

  peering between the low hanging branches of a tree stood Mick. His once shaggy light blonde hair was now significantly more disheveled and dirty. His small yellow shirt was now stained with dark brown splotches and stretched taunt over his pale greasy skin. His once bright white shoes were untied and now stained dark brown as if they had been buried in the ground. And his denim shorts were unbuttoned to make room for his now bigger stomach. 

 The vision of my once well kept friend now dirt covered and disheveled was off putting and honestly quite scary. But the thoughts were quickly washed away with the overwhelming sense of joy I felt at the return of my friend. 

I raced over to him and embraced him saying "Mick I missed you so much!" 

Feeling him return the hug allowed a warm feeling to rise within my chest. Even with his cold arms I felt warm for the first time in a long time. 

 "I missed you too kiddo" he returned.

"Where have you been all this time. I..I needed you but you were gone!" I shouted at him. 

In his newly found cold demeanor he responded "I was playing with some others for a while but I'm back now" 

"Others?" I questioned feeling very confused. 

"Yes JJ others. But you know you have always been my favorite. After all You're my best friend right?" Mick returned now allowing that unusually long jagged smile to crawl across his face. 

"Yeah of course Mick. So much has happened I need to tell you about" I screeched in a failed attempting to hold my excitement of his return at bay. 

Mick and I walked down the long driveway as I began verbally assaulting his ears with topics that he seemed to pay hardly any mind too. 

 Mick was different from the earlier years of my childhood but I didn't care. Anything was better than being stuck alone here in the woods with just my dad. 

  Mick seemed older somehow and far less interested in the kid like topics that sprung from my still young mind. He was quick to dismiss simple fun based ideas and seemed to be far more interested in the topic of my Dad and Brother. 

 "Where's stanny boy at?" He asked in a slightly off putting tone before pausing his strides and sliding his eyes to gaze at me. 

 Coming to an abrupt stop beside him I responded while peering down to my feet anxiously "He ran away... my... my dad isn't nice anymore" 

 "Your father is a worthless junkie" Mick spat into the air with disgust before continuing with "Stany boy we can deal with later".

 The statement confused me greatly. Deal with? I though internally before asking Mick what he meant by that. 

 Scoffing at the question with enough annoyance in his voice to make me feel uneasy that I had said something wrong he continued with " Where's the Prick at now? Passed out in the gutter somewhere?" 

  I allowed my eyes to travel to Micks in question. 

 " Your father JJ c'mon use your brain! " he exclaimed in a hateful manner. 

 The words stung like venom and reminded me of my father. I felt a wash of serious discomfort start to walk it's way up my spine and into my consciousness before I answered. " I don't know I'm just getting home he might be at his friend's house?" 

 I could see the wash of annoyance slide across his face at my response. He shook his head slightly before continuing on the walk back to the house. 

 I was starting to regret my dear friends long awaited return. I was starting to doubt that my friend had come back at all until mick seemed to shake off the anger and asked me to play one of my favorite games from when I was younger.

 "Hey JJ you remember tree tag?" He asked in what I now know was a fabricated act of excitement. 

 "Duh I made that game remember" I asked excitedly at the new prospect of the conversation. 

 "That really was a winner! You were always beating me at that one! We definitely have to play that again sometime!" He once again forced excitement through his brown teeth in his reply.

 Having still not noticed his facade at this point I grew happy and began smiling at the idea of playing my favorite game again. It had been years since I had made up those rules and taught Mick how to play.

 The rules we simple. One person has to go and put their head against a tree and count to whatever number you agree on while the other climbs the tree. Once the tagger reaches the number they begin climbing the tree behind the runner trying to tag them. 

 Not the most impressive game but still I was very proud of it. Mick and I had spent what felt like days of my youth chasing each other amongst the branches. 

 We finally made our way back to the shack and sat in my room for a while. Allowing only a few brief minutes of silence to pass before I once again began questioning Mick of his wearabouts. 

  "Hey Mick" I asked sheepishly

 "Yea?" He responded

 "Why did you leave me when the bad thing happened to my mom?" I asked 

 Mick turned to me letting out a deep huff before responding coldly "had shit to do JJ I can't fucking be everywhere all the time" 

 I was surprised at the sound of him cussing and that stuck with me. Mick was always trying to teach me how to be polite and how to be nice. He always said that swear words hurt others and he was right. Hearing them flow from his mouth so easily was off putting for my young mind. 

  Seeing my visual wincing Mick tried to lighten the mood with a fake peppy "When does dad get home kiddo?" 

 "I... uh I'm not sure he kinda just comes and goes. I know that he will be home tonight for sure though he never misses TV at night" I responded hoping to forget the topic and move onto something else I quickly followed up with "Where have you been since you left?" 

 Snapping at me he shouted " YOU ASK TOO MANY FUCKING...." I swear I could see his eyes flicker from a pale drained Grey to bright red and back again as his words stabbed at my ears.
 
 He paused and chuckled before responding in that once again fake happy tone. "Sorry buddy I didn't mean to get angry I'm just a little tired and very hungry. I had to travel a very long way to get here today and it was a very rough trip!" He then patted me on the top of the head and continued with "I have been all over the world traveling from place to place...helping other kids that need it"

 "Oh" I said still hearing my heart beating in my ears from the outburst. 

  Looking down at my feet that dangled off the bed I felt my eyes start to get warm and leak. I remember feeling so entirely defeated and crushed that Mick was being mean to me. I remember feeling the a pit in my stomach and heat in my face begin to rise. 

 Mick placed a cold clamy hand on my shoulder and pulled me into a half hearted one armed hug. "I'm sorry JJ I'm just cranky and so so hungry" he said softly this time.

 Hearing the words I pulled away from Mick and said "we have some food if you want it? Dad brought home some food earlier this morning... I think we have some crackers or uhh maybe an apple?" 

 Mick laughed at the words followed by "Awe that's real nice of you JJ but you know I don't eat the same things you do silly" the horrifying words didn't carry the weight that they do now as I'm writing this. 

  Mick followed his words with "Hey buddy I'm going to take a little stroll into town for a bite to eat. Why don't you stick around here and we can catch up more when I get back later...deal?" 

 "Deal" I responded as Mick shot up from the bed and was practically running out of the shack before even the weight of his words had drifted to the musty wooden floor beneath our feet. 

 Later that night my dad returned home. I made the mistake of running to greet him at the door thinking it was my friend returning. As the door swung open my world was once again enveloped in the burning smell of alcohol and cigarette smoke. 

  "Why the fuck are you so giddy boy" my dad asked as he flicked the ash from his cigarette onto the floor and kicked the door shut with his muddy boot. 

 "I uh... I... am just excited that your home is all" I replied trying to hide the ridiculous lie as best as a young boy could. 

  Chuckling sarcastically he responded with "well that makes one of us" before swiping some cans out of the way and throwing himself on the couch flicking on the remote.

 Sadly these words no longer bore any form of weight against me as they had all taken their toll years ago, infact I don't believe there are any combinations of words someone could say to get a rise out of me anymore.... I've heard em all.

 "Hey dad what's for dinner?" I asked as my words floated through the smog of tobacco smoke in the air. 

 "I got something when I was out today, guess you gotta figure it out for yourself I got some shows to catch" he said while peering right through me and into the bulbous screen of the old TV. 

 "Ok" I said before shuffling my way across the wooden flood to the dirty kitchen looking to satiate my growing hunger. Standing on the tips of my toes I was reaching for some unlabeled can of who knows what high up on a shelf when it all came crashing down.... Literally and figuratively. 

 The shelf made a tremendous crashing noise as it fell to the ground narrowly missing the tips of my small feet. I barely had time to look up before my father was there eye level with me. His breath burned like ether in my nostrils and the stench of the cigarettes radiating from his clothes mixed concocting a bile inducing smell. 

 "I...I'm sor" was all I was able to muster before he raised his hand and slapped the smell from my nose. 

 "YOU STUPID SON OF A BITCH!" He yelled as he picked up the shelf and slammed it back into its place before turning back to me. " HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT YOUR DOING! HUH? HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES JJ!" 

 Rivers of tears poured from my face as the feeling returned to my cheek and the warm burning began to grow. 

 "AH FUCK!" He shouted and he brushed past me and returned to the couch. There was a small plume of smoke rising from in between it's cushions. 

  The cigarette had fallen from his hand and in between the cushions. That's what had started the large fire that had taken my father's life. Atleast that's what the headlines read after it all happened. The police officer that arrived on scene wrote it word for word in his notepad as he asked me what had happened that night however the truth was far more sinister then that.

  The night my father died was in many ways the best night of my life. And in others the worst day of my life. 

  Shortly after the shelf had fallen from its place Mick had returned and was watching the events unfold from outside the shack through a broken window. He witnessed my dad raise his hand and hit me. He had watched my father run to the couch and put out the fire between the cushions. Witnessing these sights must have sparked a dark and twisted idea in his mind. 

  I fled the shack as my father fought the small fire. Jumping from the top step and onto the cold and sharp gravel driveway I began running painfully across the muddy rocks and into the woods. Coming to a stop at the base of a massive tree with several low hanging branches I fell into a ball of pain and anguish allowing my sweaty head to fall into my palms. 

 I wept into my lap for a short time until I heard Mick speak softly to me. "Heya JJ" the tone was a mix between pushy and fraudulently happy. "I know that your dad's not being very good to you right now but hey! Let's play tree tag! I'm sure that would cheer you up!"

   I muttered "no I don't want to" between the deep uncontrolled breaths. 

  "C'MON JJ" he pushed in a loud authoritarian voice while grabbing me by the arm and lifting me to my feet. "You climb first and il count!" He suggested while leaving absolutely no room for argument. 

 Before I knew it I had grabbed onto a low hanging thick branch and pulled my feet up off the ground. I took a moment to wipe the remaining tears from my eyes and wiped my running nose on my stained t-shirt. 

 I remember being so unbelievably confused as to why Mick was making me play this game right now... of all the times he chose right now. It's all completely clear now. 

 I flew up the tree with reckless abandon trying my best to get as high as possible before Mick started his part of the game. I was almost all the way to the top of the tree before I realized I couldn't hear Mick counting. 

 I shouted down to the now out of sight Forest floor "You have to count Mick". There was no response at all. The only noise that accompanied me up here was that of my labored breathing and a faint breeze blowing through the branches.

 I actually smelled it before I noticed it with my eyes. A large stack of black smoke began to drift above some of the smaller trees around. 

 Then I heard the yells of my father. The likes of those that still haunt my dreams. He was yelling at Mick. My heart raced as I witnessed the altercation with just my ears. 

  "WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU, GET OUT NOW!" The slurred screams of my father echoed through the tree tops as my heart began pounding within my ribcage. 

 I began my descent from the tree top as fast as my exhausted body could muster but by the time I reached the ground the flames were already shooting out the sides and from between every crack that existed in the walls of the shack.

 I resigned myself to becoming nothing more than an onlooking bystander to the destruction of what little left I had in this world. I could still hear the commotion from within it's flame scorched walls as my father and Mick came to blows. 

 The sound of ripping flesh and splintering bones could be heard rebounding off the trees and boulders that surround. I slumped to the ground in dismay. 

  After what felt like hours I suddenly felt a cold waxy hand grab the back of my arm and hoist me to my feet. 

"Wow those cigarettes really do kill" he spat through a short burst of deranged laughter before letting a demonic like jagged smile crawl onto his bloody face.
"Boy am I stuffed" he muttered slapping his greasy gut with his bloody hands.

"Here's what your going to tell the cops JJ" he said as he put a charred arm around my shoulder and leaned into me. "My dad was drunk and smoking on the couch when I went to bed, he was watching TV like he always does.... I don't know what happened"

"Got it?" Mick shot me a wild look awaiting my response

"Got it" I said weakly in response to his demands

"Good....good, now look I gotta go away for a while but you will be seeing more of me i garuntee that" He wiped the rabid foam that had pooled along the edges of his mouth while waiting for my response. 

"Okay" I responded plainly as I stared in what was certainly shock at the scene that lay blazing in front of me. My mind traced the consuming flames and found the faces of my family etched in its glow. One by one I found resemblance to my beautiful mother, my brave brother and my bastard father. Just as my emotions began to finally boil over and snap me from my almost drunken stuper I saw him. Mick was there amongst the flames standing proud and unmoving as it's immense heat turned his clothing to ashes around him. His eyes were splattered a deep bright red color and his stiff smile was lined with his jagged rotten teeth. I swear I saw a pair of horns upon his head. 

I spent the next few years of my childhood bouncing from foster home to foster home. I was always in touble in school as I never had any form of interest in the bleak subjects they taught. My life was similar to that of a ship lost at sea caught in a whirlwind of self loathing and despair a ship which I was just a passenger holding onto the rail for dear life.

I often found myself awake staring at the white ceiling in my room attempting to make out figures amongst the popcorn textured ceiling. Most of the time I would find the faces of Stan or my mom. But sometimes I would find the rough hazy eyes of my father peering cold lasers at me in the night. 

On the worst nights I would find the jagged rows of Micks teeth and his blood red eyes staring back at me. Those nightmare like images tattooed the inside of my eyelids even after I closed them in a vain attempt to wash them from my mind. 
 
I spent countless hours sitting in a designer chair in a cushy office surrounded by calming symbols and potted plants listening to my therapists attempts to prove my delusion. Unfortunately the outcome of these long sessions would only stand to prove my nightmares were real.

The police had dropped the investigation long ago but this man always seemed to put on his best Sherlock impression along with his attempts to persuade the truth of that night out into the room.

"JJ you know by now that you can confide in me!" He said while scribbling some useless notes in his yellow notepad. 

"Yup" I responded in annoyed submission 

"Well then maybe it's time you really open up to me Jake. We have been talking for years and I think you deserve to be released from this stress on your life" he said. 

I know for a fact if he had seen the consequences of his prying words flowing towards him like a deep dark river he would have stopped. I wish he did stop, I wish he would have just asked me about something else, anything else. 

Sorry Ya'll i gotta cut this off here for right now the librarian is cutting the light off and kicking everyone out. I will post more when i find the next spot with internet later 
          
        
  JJ.
