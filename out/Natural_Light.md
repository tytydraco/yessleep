The air up here is different…it’s cold. I don’t know how to explain it more than just that, the air is cold up here. But that’s why we love it right? There’s nothing quite like the feeling of breathing in cold air while being warmed up by a fire. 

I find myself thinking about how much I miss breathing that cold air as I sit here waiting for whatever that thing is out there tapping on my wall. I’m not leaving here until I know for sure that it’s gone. It’s musty in here. I haven’t cleaned in a while for one reason or another and I’d hardly call this the ‘freshest air’. 

It’s been…a while in this room. I’ve lost track of time since I started hearing that tapping. I’m not going fucking crazy I swear but sometimes it feels like I’m hearing missing beats in all of this silence. Sometimes I feel like screaming but I am afraid of what will hear me.

Now I know what you’re thinking, open a window if you want some fresh air. It’s really the funniest thing, I refuse to live with windows. I can’t deal with the things, listen if I wanted nothing but a square of glass between myself and…I’m more confused about how all of you ‘normal’ folks DO have windows.

I had windows once, I’m not a total weirdo anyway (I sure hope you wouldn’t think so). It’s just that…I know what goes through my mind when I see a window. All I want to do is go through it. I know I’m not alone in this right? You see a window and all you want to do is exert your will on such silly design. It’s just so stupid isn’t it? There’s no security. They always tell me it’s better this way.

Anyway where was I..I’m always losing my train of thought..it feels like a drill is screwing my brain into the side of my skull sometimes. Ahh yes right cold air. You know that weird thing you read about with ghosts and all that spooky shit where the air becomes cold when you’re around them? I wonder if that has anything to do with why it’s so cold here. Wouldn’t that be something. 

I wonder how long it takes for a ghost to leave a dead body. Have any of you ever thought about that? Like if you were in a room with a person that had just died how long would it take before it gets cold? Thats something that I’ve wondered about..well..it’s just something I wonder about I guess.

It’s just I vividly remember the last time I really felt that cold air on my face and it truly was such a sad time for me. They’re all gone now. It was so cold but now it’s just..so hot. 

I miss having company. I used to have a friend here but I just..remember what I said about the whole dead body being cold thing whatever I just figured I could give it a try again. It was so cold that night I just wanted to feel that air on my face again. Oh it would’ve felt like home. But they took his body before I could feel his cold embrace. And they put me in this room all by myself.

They really need to put some windows in this place. I’d kill for some natural light.
