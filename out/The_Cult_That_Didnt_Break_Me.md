One time when I was young growing up in rural Colorado and about 19 years old at the time this took place in 2004 there was this cult leader who posed as a pastor and taught us about the moral decay of decency and society through his scriptures but conveniently they were burned after his compound was rated but the FBI covered it up along with the state officials because of election season this son of a bitch got away with all sorts of horrible things and if he sees this post I hope he realizes the damage he brought upon his followers.


Anyway, Mack was a cunning, manipulative, charismatic, intelligent, and narcissistic leader who spent his days reading his version of the Bible which was just a bunch of cherry-picked verses that didn't make any sense and rewritten the suit his perverse ideology of fear and control, the Apple Friends Society was his brainchild, a twisted cult that drew in the most vulnerable of souls. It was like a black hole of brainwashing and authoritarianism he claimed to be against by posing as a libertarian but he was a cold-hearted fascist and disgusting human being.


Once a woman who was just tending his garden slipped over a rock spraining her ankle Mack just sat there and laughed claiming that she was clumsy because that is what women are meant to be and there is no hope for gender except for the ones who are not possessed by "Jezebel" and other demons calling them "succubi" and other sexist names because of his inferiority complex or whatever it was probably mommy issues, but I digress.


The cult was obsessed with apples as a symbol of purity because of the whole Eden and the forbidden fruit but Mack had his twisted interpretation where he said that we were the chosen ones to eat the apple of knowledge and be the purest form of humanity before the end of days which is why we were named the Apple Friends Society. We were isolated from the outside world, our phones and computers were taken away, and we were only allowed to read and watch what he deemed "clean" and "pure" according to him.

After our dinners we had apple cake which was his favorite gave the rest of it to his wife Lynette whose family was from Eastern Europe, the Caribbean, and South Africa but grew up in the United States she was a beautiful woman with Cuban, Bulgarian, and Slovakian ancestry who cooked our meals and did all of the chores along with the "tainted clots" or his term for the outcasts.


He had this bunker with pictures of Lynette everywhere it was eerie. But she was always in the background, never speaking up, just serving him and his needs, I often wondered what kind of hell she went through being married to a maniac like Mack and were told that we were the last Army of True Apple Friends who will rebel against the authority of the United States and of course, we believed his rantings and ravings because we were deeply terrified of this crazed lunatic who said he would escape to South America or take asylum in Cuba.


One day Lynette who was dressed in her tank top with frills, jean shorts, and sandals was tending the garden, and trust me she was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen in my life and was very curvaceous and busty but that didn't matter she was a kind and gentle woman a polar opposite of the monster she married to this day under pretenses and I'm hoping she has a good life.


But this incident changed my view about Mack forever, we were all told to gather around him and Lynette because he had a revelation, she was crying and shaking, and he announced to us that she was pregnant and that the child was a sign from the Supreme One of Uncharted Assemblies his twisted version of every deity rolled up into one that we were on the right path and that this child was the key to our survival in the coming apocalypse.


But here's the kicker, we weren't allowed to congratulate her or even touch her we were just supposed to nod and go back to our duties, I couldn't believe it, we were treated like robots, and she was treated like a sacred cow, but what got me was that Mack had been sleeping with other women in the cult, the wives of his congregation or lack of a better term, and he was the one that got her pregnant, and everyone knew it but no one talked about it because we were all scared of his wrath, but she had to go through the humiliation of bearing his illegitimate child.


Mack was a man who liked to control every aspect of our lives, from what we ate to what we wore, to who we talked to and how we talked and had this rulebook that was constantly changing based on his whims, and if you didn't follow it, you were punished with hard labor and sleep deprivation, it was like we were living in a nightmare that never ended, as his followers were told that the world outside was full of sin and temptation, and we were the only ones who could be chosen by the Supreme One of Uncharted Assemblies who later resembled a demonic and terrifying being of disgusting and depraved acts that would make even the most hardened sinner cringe.


The day came when Lynette gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, but here is the kicker and the gut punch we didn't see or hear any baby let alone medical professionals but we did see liposuction equipment and bottles of weight loss pills which were scattered about sending chills down our spine and this is when I realized we needed to get the hell out of here and Mack was a dangerous narcissist and psychopath manipulating his congregation for sick pleasure.


One night we were afraid about what we saw and compared notes by speaking in code. It was clear, that Lynette had not given birth to a child, but rather, she had been used as a cover for Mack's disgusting rituals as the whispers grew louder among us, and we knew if he found out about our escape and his plans all along we would be punished severely or even killed and the choice was made for us when he started yelling at his wife and breaking everything in a fit of rage.


We gathered in the moonlit night, a small group of the most devoted members who had seen the light, or rather the dark reality of our "pastor" and his true evil tide came out so we decided to escape, and we had to act fast, as others had heard rumors of a safe house in the next town, set up by the families and the Supreme One of Uncharted Assemblies was an idol we later found out was a statue of a man with a head of a bull, sitting cross-legged, and was decorated by what look like tanned animal skin but later it was confirmed that it was far worse than we imagined and we rather keep that to ourselves because the trauma we faced was terrifying and I've never trusted any leader again.


So anyway we just got past security somehow because they were either high or drunk from the weed mixed in with the wine Mack had them consume for his "cleansing rituals" and we had no weapons just our determination and a couple of knives from the kitchen that we had managed to sneak out but one of the guards shouted and we had to knock him over the head with a shovel before he sounded the alarm and good thing Mack was in one of his trances.


When we got out of the compound we were met silently by the FBI who were already tipped off by an anonymous source about Mack's dark secrets, they took us into custody for questioning, separating us into different rooms, the fluorescent lights glaring down like accusations themselves, surprisingly the agents were calm but firm, their faces a mix of concern and skepticism and wanted to know everything, and we were eager to tell them, hoping that this would be the end of our nightmare.


My first thought was Lynette. I hoped she had escaped with us, but she remained behind, a prisoner to her husband's twisted world, as the FBI agents led us away, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for leaving her behind and being taken to a safe house, a simple but welcoming place, far from the shadow of the Apple Friends Society, the walls were plastered with photos and newspaper clippings of missing persons cases, a stark reminder of how easily we could have become statistics.


I cried for many days about Lynette and her sweet demeanor as her smile haunted my dreams for many months until I got the call and it was her voice she said, "When Mack was asleep I crept out of the room to go to the bathroom but knew a secret passageway before I slipped him a 24-hour dosage of sleeping pills putting him on a ventilator and handcuffing him to the bed with everything he's ever done to all of us and called the FBI at first they didn't believe me but when they saw the evidence at the compound they arrested Mack but somehow he escaped when the prison transport was toppled by a roadblock and now he is nowhere to be found!" and a chill went down my spine and started to question her more about what he was planning to do and she told me that Mack was already heading to his private plane despite the manhunt.


The FBI had been searching for Mack with no luck, they had found the cult's compound filled with disturbing images and artifacts that were linked to ancient sacrificial rituals, and it was clear that we had narrowly escaped something much worse than we could ever imagine, and the news of his escape spread like wildfire, the fear of him coming back was always at the back of our minds, but we had to focus on rebuilding our lives, on healing from the trauma, and on helping the other survivors do the same.


Lynette and I became good friends and now she is living with me relearning to adjust to the real world and unlearning everything she was told by that monster who is still out there preying on the innocent for his new congregation of Apple Friends, once in a while Lynette still haunted by the horrors of her past, but she's also strong, so much stronger than I ever knew, together, we've decided to use our experiences to help others who've been through the same nightmare, forming a support group for ex-cult members.


But every year on October 9th the day that we met this monster all of us would hold a big party and bake an apple cake that looks like Mack's face and we eat a piece of him to symbolize that we are not afraid of his return and he better not cross our paths because we have each other and the truth on our side, and we will fight back with everything we've got including our strength and will to survive his wrathful and demeaning behavior through manipulation and control.


Mack if you are reading this I hope you are trembling in fear because the FBI is already after you and right now they are searching everywhere in the world and will stop to nothing until you are caught and brought to justice for what you've done, the world knows your name and your face and soon enough, you'll have nowhere to hide, we are not your pawns anymore, and we will not be silenced by your twisted teachings.
