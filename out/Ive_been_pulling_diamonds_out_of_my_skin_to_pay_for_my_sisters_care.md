My name is Daniel. I haven’t left my flat in months.

My sister, Abby, is bedridden in the next room. She’s twenty-three, disabled from an overdose at a party, and I do everything for her.

I feed her, I clean her, I keep her alive. She relies on me for everything.

The world out there doesn’t care about people like us. Insurance won’t cover the experimental treatment that could save her.

I thought I was out of options. Then something fell out of the sky.

It was around midnight. I was video calling a friend who also lived in Egglemore and owned the local pawn shop. He’d got some exciting memorabilia in from my favourite show and was showing it off on camera. He knew I couldn’t afford it, but was always excited to see it nevertheless.

Just before we hung up, the electrics glitched in my living room and the laptop went dead. Then I heard the glass explode.

A black rock had shattered through my kitchen window. It hissed and steamed, reeking of ammonia. I coughed so hard I passed out for a moment.

When I woke up, the rock was just sitting there. Cold. Dead. But when I touched it, it felt wrong... too heavy, too sharp in places. I shoved it outside.

That night I felt a lump on my forehead. By morning it had hardened, an inflamed red spot with a juicy head. I squeezed it hard, and a jagged crystal popped out of my skin.

It hurt like hell. Blood everywhere.

But I went to my friend to have it appraised. It was a diamond.

I sold it for £3k - enough to keep the lights on and pay a bit toward Abby’s medical bills. For the first time in years, I felt hope.

But the lump came back. Then another one. They spread like acne, tiny hard knots under my skin. I kept digging them out. Some were as small as beads, some as big as marbles. The pain was unbearable, but I told myself it was worth it.

Every agonising hole in my face bought Abby another day.

Three weeks later, my face is completely unrecognisable. The crystals aren’t just under my skin anymore. I have a giant one puncturing through my cheek, jagged like an icicle, dragging my head down from its weight.

I can barely see out of one eye. Everything is stained a dark crimson, light filtered through the crystalline structure.

I can’t chew anything, and trying to eat soft food is just as futile. It all slips through my cheek.

I’m running out of time, but I’ve almost hit £90k from selling them. Abby’s treatment costs £100k. One more big crystal might be enough.

The lump in my temple is as big as a fist now. I called my friend round. He reckons it will be worth at least enough to cover the rest of the treatment. He can’t hide his disgust, but he’s promised to stay.

I can’t pull this one out myself. It’s growing inwards as well as out, jutting up against my brain. I’m already losing the feeling in my body.

My friend’s got a scalpel. He keeps asking if I’m sure.

I am.

If anyone finds this post, take it as a warning.

Don’t touch the rocks that fall from the sky. It’s not worth it.

Please make sure Abby gets her treatment.
