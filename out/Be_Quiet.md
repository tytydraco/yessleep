It was about a few months ago when I heard something in my house that truly terrified me.

It was around the afternoon when I was sitting in the dining table as I usually like to do; I thought it would be just another day, but I was certainly mistaken. It all started when I began to feel somehow strange out of nowhere, like the energy in the atmosphere shifted. I can’t really describe exactly what it was, but I knew that something was definitely off. It was shortly after when I hear what seemed to be a really loud and crisp“SHHHH” coming from the living room that definitely startled me, like when someone tells you to be quiet. But it didn’t sound like someone. It almost sounded like some sort of enraged spirit from what I can describe.

Just when I tried to forget about it and think it was probably one of my family members (they were sitting in that room at the time), I hear the same thing again. This time, it was louder and more frantic. I subconsciously jumped from my seat and was basically frozen from fear at this point. Keep in mind that the TV was on in the living room and my family member that was there did NOT hear it when we asked. Also, some of my other family members were with me (in the dining room) as it happened and DID in fact hear it, so it couldn’t have possibly been the TV since the audio was set pretty low and no one was watching anything that would emit such an intense sound (it was a cooking channel). It also wasn’t anyone from my family since none of them could ever sound like that. After this happened, the ones with me in the dining room looked as scared as I was and asked about the noise as we looked around. We paused for a moment to see if we would hear it again, and we definitely did. The exact same thing. We concerningly kept paying attention to our surroundings until it came to a sudden stop and didn’t happen again for the rest of the day. Everything seemed to go back to normal. But at that moment, we were completely baffled and wondered what on Earth just happened.

After this occurred, we didn’t really talk about it and we all followed our usual routines. I guess they didn’t put much thought into it in the end, but I know that I personally couldn’t stop thinking about what we heard. I had a feeling that it wasn’t over just yet. And I was right.

About a few weeks later, it happened again. The same foreign, threatening sound that we heard a while back returned. Only this time, I was the only one who heard it. I know this because no one else seemed to react and kept going on with their day at the moment as if nothing happened. Now this could be because they were not putting much thought into it anymore, but I just knew that I somehow was the only one who heard it, and was supposed to, like it was only directed to me, though I don’t know why. Because of this, I didn’t tell anyone since I had this instinct to not do so. The thing is, it seemed to come from the living room at around the same time like before, only that this time, the TV was off and no one was there. Now I know that I must be dealing with something paranormal. This time, I reacted to the noise a bit differently: I was even more terrified, of course, but at the same time, curious. I want to know what I’ve been hearing and finally get to the bottom of this.

Ever since that day, I’ve heard the same sound at around the same place and time at least once a month, seemingly being the only one who did. Each time, however, it seems to become quieter, like it’s not as enraged or frantic anymore. All I know is that I look to figure out what’s going on more than before and, hopefully, solve the mystery one day.
