I always see a dark figure in my room. It started when I was 10 years old, and I would see it there, lurking in the shadows with two eerie, yellow glowing eyes. It stood at an imposing height, almost 8 feet tall, but some nights, it seemed even taller, closer to 10 feet because it was always hunched over. I am currently 24, a single female named Jesse, and last night, the dark figure finally touched me.  
  
For years, this mysterious entity had been a part of my life, a presence I couldn't escape. It would stand at the foot of my bed, its eyes fixed on me, and I could feel its malevolent gaze pierce through my very soul. I tried to explain it away as a trick of the shadows or my overactive imagination, but deep down, I knew something was terribly wrong.  
  
Over time, the fear of this looming figure became a constant companion, one that kept me up at night and left me feeling utterly vulnerable. I lived in a state of perpetual dread, always on edge, never knowing when the next encounter would occur. Friends and family dismissed my stories, attributing them to nightmares or anxiety, but I knew better. This was no ordinary nightmare. This was my daily reality.  
  
As the years went by, I became an insomniac, fearing the moment when sleep would finally claim me. The dark figure grew more daring, gradually inching closer each night, its unsettling presence more palpable. I felt its cold breath on my neck, heard its faint, ominous whispers, and sometimes, it even seemed to caress my face with ghostly fingers, making my skin prickle with terror.  
  
One fateful night, I lay in bed, unable to escape my fear. The room was unusually cold, and the dark figure's eyes gleamed with a sinister intensity. My heart raced, knowing that something was different this time. As I trembled under the covers, I watched in horror as the figure inched closer and closer, its grotesque silhouette becoming clearer with every passing second.  
  
I couldn't move. Fear had me paralyzed, and all I could do was watch as it drew near. Its hulking form loomed over me, and then, it happened. The dark figure reached out, its shadowy hand making contact with my arm. A shiver ran down my spine as its frigid touch sent shockwaves through my body.  
  
I tried to scream, but no sound escaped my trembling lips. The room plunged into darkness, and the figure seemed to absorb all the light. It was as if I had been swallowed by an abyss of pure malevolence. Panic surged through me, and I fought to free myself from its grasp.  
  
Finally, I managed to break free, scrambling out of my bed, my heart pounding like a drum. The room was empty, but the oppressive aura lingered. I knew I couldn't stay in that place any longer. I left that night, never to return to my haunted room.  
  
The dark figure that had haunted me for years had become more than just a frightening presence. It had become a part of my life, a part of my nightmares. I couldn't explain it, and I still can't. But one thing is for sure, that chilling touch left a permanent scar on my soul. It serves as a chilling reminder that some things are better left unexplained, lurking in the shadows of our deepest fears, waiting for the moment they can touch us and remind us that we are never truly alone in the dark.
