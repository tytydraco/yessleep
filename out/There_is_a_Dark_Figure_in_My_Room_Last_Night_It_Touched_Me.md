  
I've always seen a dark figure in my room. It all began when I was just 10 years old. I would lie there in my bed, paralyzed by fear, as those two piercing yellow eyes gazed at me from the shadows. The figure was massive, towering at what I estimated to be almost 8 feet tall. It was impossible to know for sure because it was always hunched over, maybe closer to 10 feet if it ever stood upright. I am Jesse, a 24-year-old single female, and last night, something unimaginable happened: the dark figure finally touched me. I'm scared, and I don't know what to do. I need your advice.  
  
Throughout my childhood, I tried to convince myself that this figure was nothing more than a product of my imagination or the trick of the moonlight playing tricks on my young mind. But those eyes, those unrelenting eyes, followed me into my teenage years. And as an adult, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong. I knew I wasn't crazy, and I knew it wasn't a dream.  
  
Last night, the truth I'd feared for years became a reality. I was lying in bed, just like any other night. The room was filled with an eerie silence. The only illumination came from the dim glow of a streetlight outside. That's when it happened. The dark figure slowly emerged from the corner of my room, its form darker than the surrounding shadows. My heart raced as it moved closer, and my body refused to respond to my desperate commands to flee.  
  
The figure reached out a long, bony hand, its fingers ending in sharp, claw-like nails. I watched in horrified fascination as it inched closer, and then, with a slow, deliberate motion, it touched my shoulder. I felt its icy fingers graze my skin, sending a shiver down my spine.  
  
Tears welled in my eyes as I let out a strangled scream, and the figure retreated into the darkness as swiftly as it had come. But the touch lingered on my shoulder, like a brand seared into my flesh. Panic coursed through my veins, and I knew I couldn't stay in that room any longer.  
  
I fled to a friend's house, recounting the night's events in a trembling voice. My friend tried to console me, suggesting it might have been a vivid nightmare or a trick my mind played on me. But I know what I experienced was all too real. Those eyes, that touch, they were not born from my imagination.  
  
Now, I'm writing this, seeking your advice, as I'm too scared to return to my apartment. Is it a ghost? A malevolent entity? A creature from the depths of some unknown realm? I don't know what I'm dealing with, but I can't go back until I have answers.  
  
I share this story not as a work of fiction, but as a plea for help. If anyone has encountered anything similar or knows what this dark figure might be, please, I implore you to share your knowledge. I'm trapped in a nightmare, and I need to wake up before it's too late.
