In case anyone missed what happened last week.

 I hear Mike screaming in pain behind us, but I can’t tear my eyes from the sight in front of me. 

Fear and horror, they tend to have a diminishing effect. There are only so many times you can toss spooky things at people (or evil dolls ) and expect them to react. 

But my situation, it’s the different types of fear that keep me on the brink of losing it. I’m going to assume the majority of you out there don’t have the same kind of life I do, so I’ll make an analogy to try and explain things a bit better. 

Picture this, you’re out at your favorite bar, having a good time, and at the end of the night you go to leave. Waiting for you is a nasty guy who outweighs you by thirty pounds. He’s drunk and intent on doing you harm.  

It's scary, no doubt, but it’s a scary that you can understand. And depending on who you are, maybe even deal with.  

Now, same scenario, only this time, when you leave, it isn’t a biker who mistook you for the guy who scratched his ride, but a rabid tiger. 

Still fear inducing, but in a much less familiar way, with few options as to how to handle it. 

Final scenario, when that door opens, it’s a hurricane.

Whether it’s more dangerous than the tiger, is a moot point, as there are infinitely fewer options as to how to come out of things whole. 

Waking up as some kind of Etsy Frankenstein’s monster  was my biker, the bishop was my tiger, and this place, it’s a shitstorm so bad it’s turned into a full on hurricane.

The scene in front of me, guards, human and entity struggle to wrangle more wounded torture victims than I can quickly count. 

I don’t know if it’s tactical or just the result of unfiltered rage, but the warehouse itself is becoming more corrupted by the second. It wasn’t exactly Disneyland before, but scummy, vile energy is permeating and turning everything within. 

It's bigger than it was, bigger than is possible, surfaces coated in black organic veins, tools and torture implements, rattling or crawling ,given some kind of blunt, evil sentience.

Kaz and I take our first few steps in, the floor slick with blood and some kind of spreading grey mold.  

I find myself wondering “Why in the hell haven’t I just been going invisible?”, as it hits me. 

Not some epiphany, or further mystery in my situation, something literally hits me. 

I’m dazed, vision blurry as I lay on the ground. I feel a weight on me, and as my sight clears I see a sight, pathetic and dangerous at the same time. 

Whoever it is has been here a long time. His long, dark beard is broken by scars and wounds. His scarred, pitted flesh has months of grime and filth, infected wounds, and black rot. 

He has a thick metal rod, and slams it over and over again into my head. 

I scream as a blow causes something to give way, my new eye suddenly feeling cold and dead. The pain worse than the surgery itself. 

Kaz tries to intervene, but a backhanded blow of the improvised truncheon shatters an already damaged arm. 

I want to explain something you guys might not know. 

What I give you here, is pretty filtered. It’s how I can communicate and think when I have time to sort through the confusing mess of crossed wires that is my brain. 

I respect you guys too much to make you sit through a lot of the darker urges and thoughts that are the majority of what’s going through my mind. You guys are here for the paranormal, the unknown, the supernatural. Subjecting you to another sick bastard’s twisted manifesto, isn’t something I want to do. 

But every second is a struggle, is what I’m saying. The dwindling bits of me that are still human, still rational, want to fight this forced urge to destroy, but every day one voice gets a little dimmer and one a little stronger. 

I know the man on top of me is a victim, all he saw was another random horror between him and freedom. 

But with every blow landed, it gets harder to keep my “Not today Satan.” attitude. 

I must have some kind of good karma built up, before I can watch myself eviscerate this poor bastard he’s tackled by someone in what’s left of a security uniform. 

Kaz grabs me as I back up, lifting me to my feet with a grunt of pain. 

“Where is the damned exit?” He laments. 

I see what he means, the far walls of the place are out of sight, each extending in an eyeball straining fashion beyond a false horizon. 

We go relatively unnoticed in the chaos, both sides fighting for survival. But among that horrific scrum, there are a few entities with their wits about them. Pi’s best, working quickly to restore the twisted order of this place. 

Soon enough the warehouse will be under control, and we need to get the hell out before then. 

 Kaz trips, it’s my turn to lend a helping hand. 

“Probably less people the closer to the exit we get. “ I volunteer. 

“As good of a plan as any. 

This is a display of power I’ve never witnessed. It’d be impressive under other circumstances. “ Kaz replies. 

We walk for what feels like miles through endless rows of industrial shelving and grim implements. The further we go the less sense the arrangement of objects makes. Soon enough we are having to climb over eclectic,yrandim combinations of tools, shelves and other assorted warehouse paraphernalia. 

The sounds of carnage are far in the background, but the small noises breaking the silence of our death march shake me just as bad. 

What could be the whispers of the damned, or hushed plans for our capture echo loud enough to notice but not to understand. 

Haze, both literal and ethereal thickens around us. I can feel others in the distance, but whether they are Pi’s victims or thralls, I have no idea. 

“Kaz, you’re still leaking pretty bad. “ I say. 

“Won’t be getting much better until I can get back to my shop. Or barring that a dark basement with an unlucky individual. “ Kaz answers with a cough. 

With every step I feel our chances getting slimmer. Something large and smart enough to stay out of sight has been following us. Whether it’s on our trail or just cleaning up stragglers, I have no idea. 

After what feels like hours of walking Kaz needs a break. I want to push him onward, but when I see the winding blood trail, and the handful of open fractures on his body, I relent. 

“No Judgements if you need to, you know, order some long pig.” I say.

Kaz laughs, coughs, then replies. 

“Things aren’t that simple for me, actually, I’ve been meaning to mention, they aren’t that simple for you either. 

Myself, I need time, privacy, and safety to feed. The majority of my digestion is external. 

And you, you aren’t fueled by blood either. You feed on the other thing that the human body loses when violence is applied to it. “

“What? I thought, I don’t know, it was some kind of feedback system. Are you saying, I eat souls?” I stammer. 

“More, take a bite out of. And the concept of a soul is a little rudimentary, but you’re in the ballpark. “ Kaz informs me.  

“And you feel the need to tell me this, why?” I ask, accusingly. 

“Because Punch, if this place is much larger, I’m not making it out. “ Kaz says, matter-of-factly. 

“Don’t be dramatic, it’s just flesh and bone, you’ll shrug it off. “ I reassure 

“I’m not Pi. I’m not something from another part of reality. 

I’m dying, I can barely keep moving, let lone help you. This place is warping space, and time, it could be days before we find the exit. 

When the time comes, I want you to keep going. “ Kaz admits. 

We sit in silence for a while, Kaz leaning against twisted metal shelving. 

This place makes me feel like a rat in a maze. Small, and completely at the whim of whoever created it. 

At first I think the red dot on Kaz is just another of his dozens of minor wounds reopening but then I hear him.

“Don’t move. I know I wouldn’t die for my boss, so I’m going to assume you don’t want to either. Name’s Steve.  “ Says a square jawed, dark haired man holding a massive rifle of some form, clearly pilfered from one of the guards. 

The fear, panic, and hell spawned fog has dimmed my senses. I should have been able to feel this guy, and the four others behind him coming. 

Now that I see them, that dark magic keeping me going gives me insight. 

The two women are sisters, 30’s, one a police officer and one a lawyer. The cop is the defacto leader of the group, but Steve wants to play hero more. 

The nervous looking men standing at the back of the group were abducted from a Narcanon meeting a few months back. They’re cowards, but have stepped up to the plate for their freedom. 

The specifics get a little blurry, but I see the bond, the kinship and the trials this group has been through. I saw innocence once. Here I see so much more than that, loyalty, sacrifice, and resilience.

This is one of those moments where I am going to spare you 80% of my thoughts. They were bad. 

“Easy sir.” Kaz states, shakily getting to his feet, “ I’ve been shackled by the same fiend you have. Wounded by the same hand. 

 I don’t have time to explain the finer points of things, but we all stand a better chance of getting out by working together. 

As strange as my companion and I are, we mean you no harm. “ 

I’m almost surprized by his eloquence. 

“Deb, take this.” Steve says, passing off the rifle to the stone faced officer, “ So, I’m to believe you two are the only creepy crawlies around here that aren’t out for blood?”

The man walks forward, he’s afraid, but doing a perfect job hiding it. 

“You’ll have to. We need to act as soon as possible, the longer Pi’s corruption takes hold, the thinner space and time become. Judging by the look of your group, he’s managed to drag hours into days in some places. “

“Weeks actually. “ Steve says, walking closer, “ I thought the shit I had to see in the warehouse was bad? That was the demon and his cronies just doing business.  

These things pissed off, and untethered? You have no idea the what I’ve seen your kind do. The brave people that died. “

The man is inches from Kaz now, staring up at the wounded entity, fearless. He pays me no mind, so I stay close. 

“The road is brutal and hard, I understand that. But don’t let it blind you. “ Kaz’s tone is exasperated, impatient. 

“Oh, I can see just fine. And the road is about to get a little less difficult. “ Steve says. 

I want to tell Steve to stop, to help Kaz make his case. But the man is a quick draw, and made up his mind long before he started talking. 

The stolen pistol is large, and covered in symbols that have nothing to do with either Smith or Wesson. 

Every moment of this hellhole I have been fighting to keep myself from giving in to the dark urges that have been buried inside of me. And every time I’ve been able to understand how going off on a murder spree would do nothing more than get me killed. 

That pistol would put Kaz on the floor on a good day,  right now, it’s going to finish what Pi’s goons started. 

And that little bit of logic, that tiny excuse, that spark of justification starts a fire. 


I can’t say I’m going to relate this next part unfiltered, but I’m going to be a bit more, honest than I usually am. I want all of the people rooting for me for the wrong reasons to understand, I’m nothing to put on a t-shirt. The parts of me that love doing the worst things out there are just as much me as the parts that want to try and stop the bishop. I’m not a good guy doing bad things, I’m just, me. 

Steve may be a quick draw, but I’m faster. His Achilles tendons retract into his calves  as my blades sever them cleanly. 

In the movies, and the stories, the hero can keep fighting till they’re mincemeat. And even then, they wince more at the stitching than they do at the wound. 

But in real life, things are much more fun. 

The gun drops first, then a look of confusion as he begins to fall, hands grabbing at legs that no longer obey his commands. 

I’m under him now, the wall I was vainly trying to put up between who I am and what I am is gone. 

The scream starts as gravity takes hold, it’s deep, loud and pathetic. The sound of a person experiencing more pain than they know is possible, and understanding there’s only more to come. 

But it’s cut short. 

Not by a death blow mind you, efficiency is the last thing on my mind. 

With a motion like a captive bolt gun I piston my hands up as Steve falls, sheering through the bottom of his spine. His legs stop hurting, they stop feeling anything, in fact. 

I end Steve quickly, but in a fashion that would make the creators of the iron maiden take notes. I stand in shattered ribs, staring at a face split in two.

Then, I feel it. An energy washing over me, no, that’s wrong, being drawn into me. 

What I had before, the home invaders, that was like basement meth. What I take from Steve, is China White. 

Four on one, should be a death sentence. My element of surprize is gone, but I understand things now. I feel things I couldn’t before. 

The first is, I don’t need to fight people. That’s stupid, they’re bigger, faster, and for the moment, stronger. 

I just need to fight parts of people. Everyone thinks they’re Ash Williams,  able to shrug off lost limbs if they really need to. Everyone is fucking wrong. 

Over any kind of distance, I’m slow as hell, but the strange way I’m weighted, and the effects of whatever soul cannibalizing magic keeps me going makes me agile as hell. 

The group fights on, but frailty of mind and body takes it’s toll. 

Blood pours, and I’m enraptured. It’s the opposite of instinct, every footstep is deliberate,  every twist of the blade done to cause pain, fear and hopelessness. 

Of course I take damage, but it’s all part of the dance. Those moments of hope as an improvised mace dents my skull, or a well placed kick sends me skittering, they make the slow realization all the better. 

I lose myself to this sport of brutality. 

And for a moment, I see. 

More than that, for a fleeting spot of time, I’m back. 

Faces are blurred, details seem to shift and flow, but I’m me, flesh and blood, me. 

It’s some kind of family function, massive. There’s no sinister overtones, moral compromises , or bloody battles. Just a large group of folks, the older generations having been born in Finland or Mexico. 

Peace. 

For a moment anyway. 

I stand in wrecked shelving and entrails. Fronds of the metal shell of my head are bent, not quite closing true. 

The addicts and the lawyer remain. I want to see my family again, I don’t want this power and agency to go away. 

Greed, pure selfish greed. 

I see in ways no human can. In ways nobody wants to. I understand the utility of every shadow, every metal spur, every power tool around me. 

I shed blood and take souls, dying for one more second of who I was. One more breath of air from my own fucking lungs. 

One addict clutches at a face covered in epoxy. Internal ruptures and deep wounds try to kill him before suffocation does. 

The other tries to save their friend, I dispatch them in a way that would get this account locked for explaining. 

But that act, that nearly blasphemous violation of the human body, it takes me there. 

A lake, a sunset, a small, pale skinned old woman. I can’t think of her name, or my own for that matter, but I think it’s my grandmother. 

She’s telling me something important, but I can’t make out the words. 

A spurt of blood, and a scream of pain takes me from my reward. 

But it’s not the lawyer’s blood, nor, her scream.  I’m not staring at her torn corpse, I’m looking down at 4 inches of a 9 inch knife sticking out of my chest. 

The fact I’ve posted this should let you know I didn’t die. 

I understand something as I feel my insides begin to wrap around the blade. It becomes crystal clear as that dark force within me makes the embedded weapon part of me .  

My creator knew exactly what she was doing. 

It’s a shocked death, and one that all you gore hounds out there would love. But, I think this is about as unfiltered as I can be right now. 

Before the blood has cooled, I can feel the energy fleeing my body. The more I take the quicker it leaves, and the ethereal whirlpool Pi is causing isn’t helping. 

Like every evil substance, the worst part of what powers me, is the comedown. 

I see what I’ve done, clarity comes in a soul crushing wave. I feel my mind start to flicker and war with itself. 

Kaz of all people, looks shocked. 

Justification, it’s not even cold comfort. This isn’t a war, this is a bunch of people stuck in a natural disaster. 

We walk in silence, maybe Kaz is judging me, maybe he’s just too hurt to keep up conversation. Regardless it gives me way too much time to think. 

The power, is gone, but I feel something. A little bit of what made those people, themselves. 

If I could shudder and vomit, I would. 

The impossible miles start to become barren, it feels like walking through an endless concrete void. 

We get out. It’s not a hero’s exit, it’s the miserable slink of a pack of wounded coyote. 

So folks, who hates me? I know I do. 

If this is all I am, if this is how I have to exist, does anything else I do even matter?

I’m scared. And I don’t mean that in some esoteric ‘I don’t know what I’m capable of ‘ way. This isn’t some kind of humble-brag about how strong I am. 

I know what I’m capable of now, and it terrifies me. To think that I’m locked in this god damned shell, this murderous coffin, it’s hell. I can’t think of anything Pi, nor his many relatives could put me through worse than this. 

I’m writing this from JP’s place. I’d describe things here, but honestly, I need to be in a more jovial mood, I’m not going to do it justice with the combination of fear and self hatred I have going right now. 

So please, everyone, give me any advice you have in the comments, I’m listening to each and every one of them. Whether it’s how to make peace with what I am,  how the three ( well, four, but I won’t spoil anything.) of us can get Leo out, or anything else you can think of. 

Till next time. 

Punch.
