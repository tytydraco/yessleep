I heard Rowe before I saw him. Everything was fine, then, all of sudden, my name reverberated through the dilapidated mall. His scream drowned out everything. 

A second later, his body blinked by me. 

He was falling headfirst. 

Rowe must have been distracted. Slipped on wet tile and somersaulted headfirst over the railing. Something like that. And on his fatal descent to the ground floor, he screamed my name because...I don’t know, his brain misfired? A haywire reflex? Latched onto something he saw at random? That's what made sense. I figured the man just as easily could have latched onto the sign *above* my head rather than me, screaming “*Auntie Ann’s”* as he plummeted. 

His skull was pulverized against an empty stone fountain in the food court.

Rowe's death was tragic - unforeseeable and cruel - but it was clearly an accident. Just because he said *my* name didn’t mean I had anything to do with it. When he fell from the third floor, I was standing on the second floor. 

How the fuck could his death have been *my* fault? 

A week later, I was lounging on a bench in the center of town, doodling in my sketchbook, taking small, covert sips from Dad’s “missing” flask. In other words, minding my own goddamn business. 

Then: 

*SCREEEECH.*

The sketchbook flew from my hands. I shielded my face with trembling arms. From what? I had no idea. The noise was just so loud, so unexpected - I had to do *something*. 

I peeked through the slats in my makeshift barrier. Across the street, the mangled hood of a red Fiat lay twisted around the trunk of a thick white oak. The windows were shattered. The glass was blood-kissed. No one was inside. The driver was sprawled across the road, belly-down, legs broken and deformed, knees tilted toward the sky, pointing the exposed bone of his index finger at me.

Screaming my name. 

One long, continuous howl. 

An elderly woman tried to coax him back towards the sidewalk. She lifted a wizened palm from the handle of her walker to beckon him, shouting for him to *watch out*. Her eyes darted between the maimed driver, me, and something in the distance. 

Tires screeched. A horn blared. The scent of scorched rubber stung my nose. 

A semi-truck whooshed by. Thought they narrowly missed him, but as the hulking mass slowed to a stop, I saw the dusky red shards of bone littering the road, glinting in the afternoon sun. 

The front tire clipped Beau. 

Crushed everything above his Adam’s Apple. 

Had to stay and speak with the police, of course. An officer interviewed the old woman first. Couldn’t hear the conversation, but when she made a pointing gesture, both of them shot me a glance. A whole buffet of profanities spilled quietly from my lips.

Surely they couldn't believe what happened to Beau was my fault. That would be crazy. 

Thin fingers curled over my shoulder and spun me around. 

A tall, slender man in a jade colored suit was beaming at me, the corners of his mouth stretching high enough to meet his sagging earlobes. Porcelain skin wrapped tightly around his skull. His small, blueberry-sized eyeballs sank deep into their sockets. For how emaciated he appeared, his gut was a boulder. A black dress shirt struggled to contain his clammy paunch, buttons shivering as he spoke, hanging on for dear life. 

“Evening.” He forced the word through closed teeth, barely moving his lips. His lanyard whizzed as he shoved an ID in my face. I squinted. The badge was weathered; scratched to hell and back like a losing lotto ticket. Couldn’t see his full name or really even his photo, just the word *detective* was clearly visible. 

He let go. The badge snapped back to his breast pocket. 

“How *exactly* did you know the deceased?”  

“Oh...uh, well, I didn’t...I didn’t know him, not before today. Can’t say how Beau knew me. Don’t know why he was screaming for me, either.” 

He sucked his overcrowded, cigarette-stained teeth and rolled a string of gaunt knuckles against his pistol holster. 

“You sure?” 

Slowly, I nodded. 

“But - you knew his name?”

“What?”

His beady eyes narrowed.

“You said you didn’t know the deceased...but you knew his name? Off the cuff? I got that right?”

My heart started ticking the tiniest bit faster. My head throbbed. Felt like I had a migraine coming on. 

“...think we went to the same high school, actually. Sorry. Forgot.” That was a lie. Couldn’t recall *why* I knew that man’s name. I just did. 

The detective scanned me up and down, but I wasn’t shifting about, or biting my lip ‘till I drew crimson, or sweating like a stuck pig - because I wasn’t guilty of murder. At most, he might have noticed I was holding my breath, but that was because he absolutely reeked of bargain bin cologne. Sharp, aromatic, juvenile nonsense: a scent that should be illegal to buy once you turn eighteen. Drakkar Noir and the like. 

All I was guilty of was a little white lie. Nothing more. 

He clapped. 

“Well, alright then. Have a pleasant night, son.” 

The detective winked and then began waddling away, wingtip shoes slapping the sidewalk, holding the bottom of his gut with clasped hands, supporting the girth as if he were embroiled in his third trimester of pregnancy.

Needless to say, I did *not* have a pleasant night, despite that strange man’s *heartfelt* well-wishes. The memory of Beau screaming my name before his head became converted into a long smear of red paste across the hot asphalt wouldn’t leave me alone. Barely got a wink of sleep by the time dawn nosed its way through my blinds. I forced my eyes shut. Work wasn’t for another few hours. 

Five knocks echoed through the home. 

I groaned. Lurched from bed with all the enthusiasm of a nymphomaniac at Sunday mass. I trudged across the room, bleary-eyed, and placed my hand on the knob to the closet door. Twisted my wrist until the deadbolt clicked. Something about that *click* woke me up. 

“The hell am I doing...” I whispered, letting the bolt slide into the frame. I was about to step away when I heard something else. A faint, twinkling melody, barely appreciable. Sounded like someone had opened a music box at the very back of my closet. 

Searing pain exploded behind my sinuses. 

I doubled over, grasping my sweaty forehead. Nausea bit into my stomach. 

More knocks resonated from the first floor. 

“Dad, can you get that please?” I yelled. 

No response. 

I put my ear to the closet door. 

Silence. 

My palm rested on the knob.

A single, thunderous knock shook the walls. 

“Christ almighty, I’m coming!”

I released the knob, stumbled across the hall, down the stairs, and swung the front door open. 

Rays of morning sunlight needled my eyes. A cold wind drifted through the neighborhood, curling over the empty beer bottles on our stoop, causing the rims to whistle. After a long night, Dad didn’t always feel safe delivering his empties to the curb. Alcohol made his legs wobble like stilts made of putty. He called them his “sealegs”. 

Something on our welcome mat caught my eye. 

The cardboard box was small and tattered. The corners were soggy, crumbling with moisture. It smelled distinctly of metal. No return address or postage. A message was scribbled on the front in black ink:

*For “You”!*

My mouth became painfully dry. I surveyed the vacant street before bending over. Didn’t want anybody to see me picking up the box. Couldn’t say why. 

Something heavy rattled around inside. 

I threw the package into the trunk of my car, along with the empty bottles littering my stoop. 

Didn’t want anyone seeing those either. 

\- - - - - 

Next was Jentsen. We passed by each other in the frozen foods section of the grocery store. His voice slurred as he screamed my name, collapsing into a lifeless heap shortly thereafter, lines of blood trickling from his nose. The aneurysm detonated like a grenade inside his skull. 

After that? Mr. Streen. 

Some methhead ambushed him. Pulled the old man into an alleyway and demanded his wallet and his watch, switchblade pressed snuggly against his jugular. He didn’t resist. No, he wisely kept his mouth shut, right up until I happened to walk on by. Without warning, the man belowed my name. The methhead hadn’t slept in days. His frazzled brain did what it thought it needed to: stop the noise by any means necessary. 

Plunged all five inches of that switchblade straight through Mr. Streen’s right eye. 

Even though I hadn’t done anything, even though none of it was my fault, I was still a mess. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t relax. Hell, I could barely think. The only two words rattling around my mind were:

*Why me?*

Made getting through my workload at the factory especially challenging. So when my supervisor’s voice blared over the intercom, I wasn’t as irritated as I’d usually be. Might as well be lectured about new OSHA regulations; couldn't focus on the task at hand anyway. 

*Meeting on the floor in ten.* 

He stood at the podium, tapping a pudgy finger against the microphone. Bits of static crackled over the loudspeakers. Took us a while to quiet down; that was par for the course. What *wasn’t* par for the course was our supervisor’s response. He wasn’t incensed by our disrespect. No righteous fury. If anything, his expression was glum. His wrinkled cheeks seemed to be drooping even lower than usual. The whole aesthetic was very “sad, homeless Basset Hound caught in the pouring rain”. 

Out of nowhere, my palms began to sweat. Dull pressure pulsed against the underside of my scalp. I spun around in my seat. 

Something was wrong. I just couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“Hard news today, folks," he said, static crackling under his voice. 

I perked my ears. For a second, I thought I heard something buried in the static. The shireks of a hollow melody, slow and rhythmic, a suite of tiny strings being viciously plucked. 

“Terrible thing - ” he continued, “ - an outlandish, terrible accident...and...well, Mary's dead.” Mary was the factory’s overnight security guard. 

The static cleared, and the workers fell silent. My headache dissipated. No more hollow melody, either.

Figured I was just exhausted enough to be hearing things that weren’t actually there. 

Now, don’t get me wrong: I *was* upset by the news. Mary was a good guy. Mostly good, anyway. Provided the crew with a lot of clean, affordably priced weed, which is how he earned his nickname: Mary, short for Mary-Jane. The man wasn’t perfect, though. He could really talk your ear off about his ex-wife if you weren’t careful, and he’d been caught watching some truly bizarre pornography on more than one occasion, but, all things considered, he was alright. Certainly didn’t deserve no cosmic death penalty, so I was sad to hear he was gone. 

But I was also a *little* happy my name hadn’t been tagged onto the accident. 

Spent the rest of the day suppressing a relieved grin. Mimicked the cold emptiness of shock and grief to the best of my God-given ability. 

When my house key clicked into the lock that night, I still felt exhausted, but I was calm, ready to hibernate. The door creaked open. A wave of thick darkness greeted me. As it swung shut, I sniffed. There was something strange floating through the air. A devastatingly familiar odor, harsh and overpowering. 

My fingers crept across the wall. 

I flicked the lights on. 

“Evening,” he said.

Down the hall, at the head of the kitchen table, sat the detective. 

He had his bulbous gut nestled under the table, raising the end slightly up and off the floor. A pair of gaunt, fleshless hands rested on a closed laptop. Same jade colored suit, same wide, toothy grin. 

I leapt back, flailing. My tailbone thudded against the wall. I bit my tongue. Blood danced across my palette. 

“What...what the fuck...” 

“Oh come now, son. Don’t blow a gasket. It’s alllllllriiiight.” He licked his paper-thin lips; a single careful, protracted, lecherous rotation.

“Your Dad let me in.” 

He kicked a nearby chair, pushing it from the table. The squeak of the wooden legs made my heart flutter. 

“Take a seat. I have...*new* evidence to run by you.” 

“No. No...I won’t. I’m calling the police.”

He grabbed the laptop, slid it into his armpit, and winked.

The faintest wisp of a headache thrummed against my temple. 

His smile faltered. 

Suddenly, he placed his hands on the edge of the table and threw it aside as if it were weightless. The ground rumbled. Salt and pepper shakers clattered against the floor. My heart rate turned rabid. He approached with unnatural speed - quick, twitchy movements - lowering his head so the top wouldn’t rub against the ceiling. 

“Boy, we don’t need the police. I’m *much more* than the police. I am God’s decree. I am judgment given flesh.” 

He ripped the laptop open and shoved the screen in my face. 

“Now *watch*.” 

A grainy security feed played. I pretended to watch. Slowly, my hand reached for the knob.

The detective slammed his elbow into the door with enough force to splinter the wood. His gut bobbed. I peered up at him. He glared daggers into me. His tiny, sunken eyes were diffusely bloodshot. I could barely see the whites. 

My gaze drifted back to the video. It took me a moment to understand what I was looking at. The black-and-white image lagged, the pixels shuddered, and there was no sound. A man was walking towards the camera in a series of buffered steps. Gargantuan machines flanked his pathway. 

My eyes widened. 

Mary.

It was Mary, doing his nightly patrol at the factory. 

A pressurized piece of flat steel exploded from one of the machines. In a handful of choppy snapshots, the metal flew through the air and crashed into his forehead. He stumbled back, gripping his skull. When his back collided with one of the machones, he pulled his hand away and stared at it. Hard to say for certain, but it appeared like he unintentionally dislodged a piece of fragmented bone. Mary looked dumbfounded by the fact that he was cradling a piece of skull in his palm. 

The man fell to his knees.

With his last bit of life, he twisted around, dabbed his finger into the head wound, and began dragging it against the surface of the machine. 

Each letter was agonizing. 

The flashing screen burned my eyes. 

“Now...*what* do you see?” 

The pounding in my head reached astronomical heights. A swirling drill bit gradually pushing through the skin, and the bone, skewering the jelly within. 

“It’s...it’s my name.” 

In the footage, Mary collapsed face-first into the machine. An eruption of blood and brain splattered across his visceral graffiti, obscuring the message. 

The detective's smile returned. 

He slammed the laptop shut and stepped away. 

“Perfect! Perfect, perfect, perfect.” He lifted a single, bony index finger. “One *final* question, and we’ll be through here, once and for all. You ready?” 

My headache marched on. Bile lept up my throat and lashed my tonsils. Somehow, I managed to nod. 

“What name?” 

“...huh?”

“You said you saw your name...what name would that be? Tell me, son. For this to be over, you have to say it.” 

I shut my eyes. Electric rage crackled across my skin. 

What did I do wrong? Nothing. Not a single thing. I was a victim of circumstance. A tormented soul, undeserving of persecution. 

I’m not *that* person. 

“GET **THE FUCK** OUT OF MY HOUSE,” I screamed. 

The room became silent. I couldn’t smell the cologne anymore. My eyes gradually opened.

The detective was gone. 

I wasn’t relieved. 

There was something worse than him upstairs. 

The delicate, crystalline whirring of a music box, singing a pitiful melody. That same, contemptible nursery rhyme, over, and over, and over, and over...

I lost control. 

I lost control, but that wasn’t my fault.

I stomped up the stairs, snarling like a madman, denting the wall with a white-knuckled fist. I just couldn’t take it anymore. The melody was unbearable, acid dripping against my eardrums, and it was only getting louder. 

I stormed into my bedroom and threw the closet door open. 

The alcove was narrow but deep, and the music box sounded like it was located in the very, very back. One by one, I ripped shirts and sweaters and suit jackets from their hangers, digging further and further inside. I was going to break the damn thing. Smash it all into a million, worthless pieces. The song was so incessant, so needy, so goddamned loud.

I was nearly there, but I paused at the last item of clothing.

A jade colored suit with a black dress shirt underneath, wavering back and forth, taunting me. 

As the music chimed on, I reached to move it out of the way. My fingers landed on the black fabric. The song abruptly stopped. 

Something pushed back against my fingertips. 

The shirt ballooned, inflating silently. A skeletal arm unfurled from the left sleeve like a firehouse. Then the right. 

I staggered back, gasping. 

Bare, emaciated feet shot from the pants' legs. 

I turned and began sprinting out of the closet. An audible *pop* rang out behind me. 

“Where you off to now, slugger?” The detective asked, his voice gurgling, water-logged. 

I slipped on a stray clothes hanger and rolled through the doorframe. My jaw thumped against the floorboards. A molar cracked and dislodged. I swallowed it whole. 

“You forgot something in the car, by the way.” 

A wet cardboard box fell into view. The walls were flimsy from the moisture, so the object inside tore through the side as it landed. 

A gun. 

It wasn’t loaded, but the handle was stained a shining crimson. A single shard of bone was lodged in the grip, no bigger than a penny. 

“Tell me, and be honest - are you not gonna say it? Are we really going to have to do this whole song and dance *another* time?”

“Where’s...where’s my Dad?” I muttered, stomach against the floor, vision swimming. He leaned close. I could feel his lips quiver against my ear. 

“Always gotta hide, don’t you? If you’re still a boy, then, surely, you ain’t old enough to have made a boy of your own, isn’t that right?” he whispered. 

I flipped onto my back and scuttled away. 

“Listen, sport, this has been *a lot* of fun. You’re a legend in my neck of the woods - I wouldn’t be here if you weren’t. They don’t assign me to just *any* Joe-Schmo who can’t get a grip. I mean, the raw, cold-blooded brutality of it all, and to your own kin...” 

“Stop...please, leave me alone...”

He sighed. Something inside his gut squirmed, tenting the skin in multiple places. 

“Can’t. Not until you say the magic word. The police may have given up, but, as I said, I ain’t the police. I need to know that *you* know the type of man you truly are, kid-killer.” 

“No...no...it’s not my fault...”

He shushed me with a long, pallid finger. 

“You hated taking him to the mall. You hated the way he spent his time, drawing, drinking, refusing to earn a cent. You hated having to shop for someone old enough to be enlisted in the army. You hated the way he stole your time and your money, because, *boo-hoo*, you’re a victim, a poor old man with a knife to his neck. You hated the thought of dying one day, stroking out alone in the factory with - according to you - nothing to show for it...” 

“IT’S NOT MY FAULT!” I screamed.

He reached into the closet and retrieved a sleek, red box. The detective grinned, cranking a golden wheel on its side. 

“Worst of all, you hated that he *made* you lose control, because you can’t stop thinking about that precious little boy who so loved his nursery rhymes, and you can’t stop imagining caving *that* boy’s skull in.” 

Salty tears streamed down my cheeks. 

“I didn’t...why...why me...”

“Come on, son. Think. Rowe, Beau, Jentsen, Streen, Mary. Rowe, Beau, Jentsen, Streen, Mary. Ain’t even two names you need to recall: just one. Junior and senior, a man and his son. Now, was that choice born from megalomania, laziness, a lack of creativity, or some combination of all three?”

The world was spinning. I couldn’t find the word he wanted. 

No, I *refused* to find the word he wanted. 

“Nothing? Disappointing. Well, looks like it's time to paddle upstream and try again. Think I’ll let you remember *a bit* more this time around. Don’t get it twisted, though - it ain’t compassion, I’m just getting impatient.”

Fear bloated in my chest. I shook my head wildly, beseeching absolution, pleading for mercy.

Because I sort of remembered what came next. 

He released the wheel. It started to turn. 

Someone was thundering down the hallway. 

“NO! PLEASE!” 

A man burst into the room. 

He looked exactly like me. 

The melody began to chime.

*“Row, row, row your boat...”*

Rivers of blood gushed from his vacant eye sockets. He wobbled across the room, adjusting to his sealegs. 

“*gently down the stream...”*

The detective cackled like a drunk hyena. The other man picked up the gun from the floor and lurched towards me. 

*“merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...”*

He lifted the hilt of the gun high above his head. 

*“life is but a dream...”*

I slammed my eyes shut and braced myself. 

I waited.

I didn’t die, but there was nothing around me - 

A vast, anesthetizing silence. 

Then, someone screamed my name. 

I opened my eyes just in time to catch sight of Rowe falling through the mall, headfirst, his skull destined to break against that empty stone fountain. 

People looked around in abject horror. 

They begged for an explanation. 

Some way to reconcile the tragedy. 

I couldn’t give them that.

All I could offer was a faint, penitent whisper: 

“God,

I’m so, so sorry,

[Tom.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
