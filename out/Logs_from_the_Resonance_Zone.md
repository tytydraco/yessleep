**07:30** \- *Substation 7C is quiet this morning. Everything is normal—the readings are stable, power fluctuations are small, and the ambient hum of the pylons is steady.* 

**08:05** \- *There’s something strange near the eastern pylon. The grounding rings are coated in a residue. At first, I thought it was just mineral buildup or dirt from the last storm, but it’s not. The texture is fibrous, almost organic. I’m going to take a sample and send it to the lab.*

**08:17** \- *A herd of deer wandered into the clearing. I’ve seen wildlife near pylons before, but these deer… they stopped suddenly, like they’ve hit an invisible wall. They just stood there, staring at the pylon for what felt like forever. Then, all at once, they bolt, vanishing into the trees.*

**10:45** \- *There’s been a power spike—12%, then 14%. The numbers jump erratically on my monitor. I’m trying to activate the field dampeners, but it’s struggling to sync. The rings keep cycling out of phase, like something is disrupting it. I’m officially raising this to a Category One incident.*

11:12 - *There’s a noise near Pylon 7E. At first I figured it was wind, but it’s more of a low crackling sound, almost like static, but layered. I can hear something faint in it—like a voice. I know its not unusual to have this kind of reaction to a Category One, but it’s unsettling. Also, I’ve sent a report to Maintenance about the dampener issues, they’re still not syncing so I’m headed across site to try and find some spares.*

11:23 - *The residue on the grounding rings is spreading. It’s no longer just coating the base; it’s climbing the pylon. It’s branching upward in vein-like patterns. From the cabin monitors, it seems almost like it’s almost pulsing, like it’s alive. I’d take another sample, but I’m not getting any closer until it’s stabilised again.*

12:08 - *The situation is escalating fast. Power spikes are now exceeding 50%, I’ve radio’d Guinevere and escalated this to a Category 2 Deviation. The grounding rings have failed completely. The residue is spreading across the entire eastern pylon, wrapping around it in thick, blueish veins. It’s definitely pulsating, and faster now, I can almost feel it in my chest, like the vibrations are inside me.*

12:19 - *The deer are back, but they’re… wrong. One collapsed near the pylon, and I can’t stop staring. Its body is deformed—bones jutting out in smooth curved arcs, fur peeling away to reveal patches of taught, translucent skin, grey. Its legs are backward, like they’ve been put back together wrong. It’s trying to stand now. It doesn’t know it shouldn’t be alive.*

12:27 - *The noise has changed again. It’s not static at all—it sounds, well it sounds almost like music—it’s crazy because I’ve heard about all of this in training, but no amount of training can really prepare you for this. And the voice, its crystal clear now. It’s not saying words, not exactly, but it feels so familiar. I keep trying to remind myself that its just the side effects of the deviation. I know that I need to leave, to get outside of the resonance zone, but I don’t want to, I want to stay.*

*ID 9124: Bodycam Footage - Transcription*

\[12:50\] -  *The camera operator is stands underneath the eastern pylon. The aforementioned residue seems to have coated the base, climbing higher. It appears to pulse rhythmically. The camera operator reaches out, his hand trembles as it brushes the fibrous material. The material expands to meet to his skin, the operator tries to pull away, but it clings to him.*

\[12:54\] - *The operator is laughing, a possible panic reaction, the laughter continues becoming increasingly erratic. He drops to his knees, staring at his arm as the residue spreads. In between laughs, he exhales a whisper: “It’s beautiful”.*

\[12:55\] - *The camera distorts, the image twisting into static before the feed cuts off completely.*

10:00 - *Two weeks. It’s been two weeks since Substation 7C, and I still don’t feel like myself. The health and wellness team says I’m fine, but my arm tingles sometimes, like I’m still there. Apparently it’s just nerve trauma, but I don’t know.*

*The weirdest part of it is that sometimes I wish I was back there. I haven’t said this to anyone because it sounds crazy, but part of me wishes I could go back. I felt… connected, like I was part of something bigger. Like I understood something important, but now it’s gone. It’s so hard to explain.* 

*Anyway, they want me back in the field. They say I’m ready, and I don’t know if I am, but I can’t take anymore sick leave, so I’m going back out there again tomorrow. At least they’ve assigned me somewhere new I guess.*
