You know it’s funny working nights.
Any job that makes you do so in solitary can have an effect on your mind if you’re not careful.

I never paid attention to being careful before.

I just put my headphones in and cleaned.
I arrived at the normal time for each building.

I have one of them hoover commercial backpacks you see the new cleaners wear.

I got mine last week.

I look like a professional Ghostbuster now.
If only I knew how apt that was.

There’s this one building on my route that I always get to around 02:40-ish.
It’s a huge big white building in the corner of Jury Street.

Jury Street – I have no idea if it is a coincidence – but the building is at least 200 years old and the building is full of legal correspondence.

It’s linked to the courts where today something as trivial as a petty fraud all the way back to 200 years ago when a murder was a sentencing for the gallows.
I could never tell if this place was giving me the creeps or if I was secretly in awe.

There are things in life even we as a human race have done, though awful – they are still pretty magnificent to look at from afar.

I got there for 02:39; I was on time.

I got my keys out and opened the main doors.
I quickly fixed the security before the alarms went berserk and went to work.

When I had reached the back of the first floor and wiped everything down—I did what I always do.

I went out the fire door to have a sneak glass of whisky and a pre-made rolled-up cigarette.

This was my last haunt before heading home and I liked to take my time.

I didn’t have anyone apart from my tortoise to go back to.

Just me and Esio.

I named him that from a Roald Dahl book I was lent.

That’s when I was learning English.

Lots of books as presents that year.

I preferred the pictures but that story about a tortoise stuck with me and that little guy makes me want to go back home.

Especially now, it was cold tonight; there was nothing special about the sky, everything else was normal.

I liked the quiet.

I was used to the quiet.

It was the cold I could never get used to.

I flicked my cigarette and as it landed, a peculiar thing—flames.

I thought at first it was the whisky I was drinking.

Had I spilt some?

I didn’t need to ask these questions for even a nanosecond before the flames turned into a big triangle.

I ran inside and grabbed a bucket I used for the windows, filled it with water and rushed to throw it over the flames that were still ignited outside.

I wasn’t so much worried but the last thing I needed was to get caught out in my nightly “coffee” breaks.

I locked the back fire door shut and headed to the second floor.
It was dim up here.

I had the option to make it brighter but I hated that electric light they used in the winter days when I’ve walked past before a shift.

The only thing I didn’t like was how this dim light reminded me of when I was a kid in hospital.

I forgot to drink water and started seeing patterns so my mum dragged me to the hospital.

Hospitals at night are the strangest of places.

I remember waking up at midnight—scared, alone and small—wanting my mum.

Forgetting she wasn’t there I turned to my right and instead a little girl was next to me clutching a teddy bear.

I asked her what she was doing.

If she was ok.

She didn’t say anything; but she lifted her pyjama top slightly to reveal a great big surgical cut.

She climbed into my bed—slowly—without taking her eyes off mine and after a while of gazing at each other I drifted off into a long sleep.

When I awoke she was gone.

Back upstairs and in one of the main offices I always get a bit weirded out by one of the desks I clean.

Once a month just after payday there’s a Polaroid picture that turns up. It always depicts someone in bed.

It’s always amused me; I assume that person must be hungover and it’s from a corporate work trip.

Each month they get someone else.
I mean it’s a big company.

I’ve seen women with barely anything on.
I’ve seen men with nothing on and sometimes there’s a person in the background.

The odd thing is the lurker always look serious.

Today when I reached the desk I glanced at the Polaroid very quickly as I always did but instead of humorously getting on with it I done a double take.

The person looked a lot like me.

My chest was giving rapid-fire palpitations because the photo was only just developing.

I could see it was me but my face was smooshed in the pillow and on the desk next to me now Esio came to view.

I could see the bed covers too—the floral decoration picked by my grandmother—but that’s not what freaked me out.

The last thing to develop.

The little girl with the teddy bear and the scar.

She wasn’t looking at me in the bed.

She was looking at me now—so was the bear and just as I held my mouth open she smiled and the little bear waved.

I threw the Polaroid back on the desk like it was too hot to touch and ran out into the hallway looking left and right.

I didn’t understand.

If it was just developing who was in the building with me?

Isn’t that crazy though?

The picture was of me and a girl from 23 years ago.

She would be almost 30 now.

Did she cause that fire? 

I’m due home in 45 minutes!

Do I go home, sneakily stay here, or run as far away as possible? 

I started writing this for help but I think I know what I need to do.
