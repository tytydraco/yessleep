When I was a kid, there was one thing that terrified me more than anything else. It wasn’t monsters or ghosts or anything that made sense in the dark. No. It was the stairs.

The house was old—one of those homes with creaky floors and doors that never quite shut right. It was two stories, with a basement, and my room was at the very top. I remember the first time I noticed it—the feeling that something was always waiting for me when I went up or down those stairs.

It started small. I’d turn off the lights in the basement after a long night of playing video games, and as I climbed the stairs to go to bed, I’d get this overwhelming sensation that someone, or something, was right behind me. Not in a “I’m imagining it” way. No. This was different. It was like I could almost feel its breath on the back of my neck. And I’d always rush, running up the stairs, desperately trying to reach the top, where I’d be safe.

But there’s a trick to it. It’s the same trick that anyone who’s ever been a kid—and anyone who’s still a kid—knows: you pull the covers over your head, and you’re safe. The bed sheets, for some reason, made everything okay. If you could just get under the blanket, no matter how dark the room, no matter how thick the silence, you could hide. You were untouchable.

But that was when I was a kid.

It wasn’t until I moved back into my childhood home as an adult that I realized how deeply that fear had been buried. It had been years since I’d felt the same way, but somehow, when I turned off the lights at the bottom of the stairs one night, that all-too-familiar sensation crept back in.

I remember standing at the foot of the stairs, the house quiet, the air thick. The only sound was the hum of the refrigerator and the soft tick of the clock. I felt it, that sensation—the kind of instinctive dread you don’t even think about, the kind you just feel deep in your bones. The kind that comes when you know something isn’t quite right, but you don’t know what it is.

I hesitated at the bottom of the stairs. The darkness up there felt different now. The stairs creaked in that old way, like they had a life of their own, a pulse that resonated deep into the floorboards. I couldn’t help but glance over my shoulder, half-expecting to see something lurking in the shadows. But, of course, there was nothing.

I laughed to myself. It was just the memories, right? The old house playing tricks on me. Just go upstairs. No big deal.

But then it hit me.

The reason I was so scared wasn’t just the darkness. It was the silence. The absolute, crushing silence that had settled in. I hadn’t noticed it at first, but now, standing at the bottom of the stairs, it was deafening. There was no sound. No movement. Nothing.

I turned back to the stairs and started walking up, my heart beating faster with each step. The stairs creaked under my weight, and I tried to ignore it, trying to focus on the soft glow of the hallway light waiting for me at the top. But with every step I took, I couldn't shake the feeling that someone—no, something—was waiting for me just out of sight. Just a few stairs below, watching me, waiting for me to turn my back.

I could almost feel it in the air. Like the house was holding its breath.

I tried to walk faster, my pulse quickening. But then I heard it—a soft scuffle, like something scraping against the floor.

I froze.

For a moment, everything was still again. The kind of stillness that makes your skin crawl.

Then, a whisper. Just a faint rustle, as though something—or someone—was on the stairs behind me. It wasn’t my imagination. I could feel it. I could hear it.

But I couldn’t look back. I couldn’t. The second I looked down, I knew I wouldn’t make it. I wouldn’t be fast enough. I would be caught.

So I pushed on, faster now. Each step felt heavier, as though the air itself was dragging me down, as if the house itself didn’t want me to leave the safety of the light. I could see the top of the stairs, just a few more steps—just a few more—

Thump.

A loud, unmistakable thump. A heavy footfall behind me.

I didn’t dare look back. I ran, tripping over the last few steps, throwing myself into the hallway at the top. My chest heaved as I slammed the door behind me, locking it.

I stood there, panting, too scared to move. The house was dead silent again, but I could feel the air shift—just a little, just enough to make me feel like I wasn’t alone.

I thought I had it under control. I thought I was safe.

But later that night, as I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, I heard it again. The unmistakable sound of footsteps. Heavy. Slow. They were coming from downstairs.

My heart leaped into my throat.

I pulled the sheets over my head, my childhood reflex kicking in. The sheets. They would protect me. I was safe.

But when I peeked out from under the covers, I saw something that froze the blood in my veins.

The door to my bedroom—slightly ajar—was now wide open.

I didn’t hear the footsteps anymore. The silence was back, but it was worse this time. It was the silence of something waiting, something patient.

And then, I saw it. A figure. A dark shape in the corner of the room. It wasn’t moving, but I could feel it. It was watching me.

I stared at it, too terrified to blink, too terrified to move.

Then, the voice.

It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t even a whisper. It was just a thought that wasn’t mine, creeping into my mind, soft and insidious.

"You think you’re safe, don’t you?"

I pulled the sheets tighter around me, but I could still feel the presence, like it was there, breathing, just inches away.

I couldn’t stop thinking about those stairs. About the way I always thought I was safe, just because I was in my room. About how I always believed the sheets were enough to protect me.
