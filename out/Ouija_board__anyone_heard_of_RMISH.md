Me and my friend decided to try the Ouija board when we were 15 (back in the 90’s), probably due to boredom, from seeing lots of tv/movies on the occult and I’ve always had a general interest in the paranormal/spirits/afterlife. I didn’t think it would actually work. 

We made our own board from schoolbook paper, only drawing out the alphabet, numbers, yes and no. We forgot about goodbye so we would spell this out once it started working.  We tried for about half an hour with a small clear glass, then we changed out planchette to a silver largish coin. We asked if anyone there, no response so we asked if (let’s just say John) was there - this was a young person in 20’s who had died in our locality recently in suspicious circumstances but neither of us knew him. 

HI REDRUM 

We asked are we in danger. No answer. We then asked is anyone there? 

RMISH  

Do you know about the future? 

I KNOW LOTS. 

We asked something as in “like what”? 

I WILL NOT TELL. 

Do you know about our future? 

YES 

Will we be successful in life? How?

YES. MINDS. 

Then my friend called (had a portable land line phone) and wanted to visit, I was speaking with him on the phone. The board spelled out 

TALK TO ME 

We asked can we leave? 

NOT SURE 

We said can we please leave.

OK BYE BORING 

I remember the feeling of when it worked, disbelief and fear, kept accusing my friend of moving it, she said no look and we lifted our fingers up just barely touching the coin and it was spelling fast. 

We left to meet our friend and brought him back to the house to prove to him that it works, he sat to the side watching us, not using the board, as soon as me and my friend touched the coin/planchette it quickly spelt out

LEAVE 

We said ok bye, then the coin flew to 

NO 

LEAVE

We said goodbye and stopped using it. We gathered up our paper/board and left the house and burned it under a bridge throwing the ash - and I think the coin - into the river. 

We were terrified after, trouble sleeping etc. We hadn’t a clue what we were doing, I realise now our questions were stupid and the way it “spoke” freaked us out. We didn’t protect ourselves I think. Word got out among our friends/school so we said that we were moving it ourselves to avoid becoming outcasts (we grew up in a catholic community, raised going to church etc.) My friend told me we were moving it with our minds, we both wanted to believe that but we didn’t although we kinda had to or else peers family etc would think we’re possessed! 

Never tried it again and my friend won’t speak about it and is afraid of anything paranormal since. 

I always worried that something had attached to me and/or the house, back then (97) it was a taboo subject so it’s great to come here and read other peoples experiences. Any thoughts on what RMISH means? 

I’m not sharing my story to try to prove anything, there will always be skeptics to everything,I’m not convinced on the ideomoter affect as we would not have spoken like that and we felt the pull from underneath the coin, very strong when we brought the third person into the room. 

If anyone has advice on clearing the house ourselves properly I’d still love to know after al these years! I splashed holy water around after and saged a few times but not sure if it was enough. I’m not particularly religious (left all the church stuff in childhood) but am very spiritual.
