Guys I need help. I don't know what to do.

It started last week. I kept finding hair in my teeth. Yes, I know it's disgusting. I am usually an extremely clean person. I don't have any pets, and I take pride in keeping my apartment almost spotless. I clean dishes as soon as I'm done with them, and I am constantly dusting and vacuuming. It is extremely rare if my hair passes my lips - I always keep my hair in a sleek, high ponytail. But I know for a fact that this isn't my hair. It's too long to be mine. It's also too dark.

On Thursday it was one hair. It was stuck in between my teeth. I painstakingly pulled it out (it was very long, and black). This was weird because I have no idea where it could have come from. I don't hang out with anyone that has long, black hair (and I rarely have people over to my apartment). No one at my work has hair like that either (I work as an assistant in a small legal office). The only person I can think of with hair the same length and color is this homeless woman that bumped into me on my way to work that morning. She made me spill my coffee, so I was pretty pissed. I don't often raise my voice at strangers, but I think this was warranted. Now, I didn't have a coffee for my morning at work, and I also had a huge stain on my neatly pressed, pink dress that I had to wear all day. She said something back to me that was completely incoherent. She was probably drunk, or on drugs (as most homeless people in my area are). She stared at me as I walked away. Her lips were moving, but I couldn't hear what she was saying as she seemed to be whispering.

Friday there was more. I kept having to go to the bathroom at work to look at what was irritating the roof my mouth. I ended up pulling 3 hairs out from between my teeth that day. I thought maybe it was something I ate. I don't know how that could explain this strange experience though. I sit by the window of my office building and I SWEAR I saw that same homeless woman. She was standing across the street. She was looking at me and had a huge, deranged smile on her face. I can just picture her greasy, long hair and her crooked teeth. She had the audacity to wave at me. What a freak.

This past weekend it got worse. I was pulling hair out of my THROAT. It felt like it was stuck back there. I had to use a tissue to get a good grip on it, and I had to tug fairly hard in order for it to dislodge. These were not just individual pieces of hair like the past few days...I haven't eaten anything since, I'm too grossed out. Where is this coming from??? 

It's getting worse. Today I pulled a big clump of long, black hair from my throat. It took me awhile to get a good grip on it as I had to reach pretty far back into my mouth. As I gagged repeatedly, it just kept coming in big, long, slimy chunks. This is the most I have gotten at once. I tried to get as much as I could, but I can't seem to get enough to stop the feeling of more in my throat.

Right after this happened I heard a scraping sound outside my apartment door. I peeked through my peephole. She's out there. That woman. That vagrant. She's dragging her hand along the wall of the hallway on my floor as she walks. I can hear her nails trailing against the wallpaper.

This is getting really hard to handle. The clumps keep coming. At times I am choking and gagging with hair literally hanging out of my mouth in wet, soggy, goopy chunks.

I didn't want to, but I just used my phone's flashlight and looked in my mouth in the mirror. I don't know how to explain what I saw. There is definitely more hair, but I also saw something else.

It looks like an eye.
