I grew up in a remote area of Mexico with my family, and in these areas, you often hear many stories like the one my grandfather told me about these elves or Aluxes, as they are better known in Mexico. These beings are part of our rich cultural heritage and have been a topic of fascination and reverence for generations.

These beings have been created by humans since ancient times. Our ancestors used them to protect their fields or crops. These beings could be created from clay or wax, and you could gradually give them life with a special pozole made from a particular type of corn called Xtub. This process is steeped in ritual and tradition, reflecting the deep connection between the Mayan people and their land.

You place them anywhere in your field and make a hole in the middle of their head, and it is through this hole that you will feed them their special pozole every Tuesday and Friday. After 9 days, they will come to life, and you will be able to see all the powers they have. These powers are said to be formidable, granting the aluxes abilities to influence the natural world and protect the crops with a level of diligence that surpasses human capability.

You need to talk to them and tell them that this is your crop and that you want them to take care of it while you work. The alux will always keep your crop alive, even during droughts. Other people won't be able to steal from your crop, nor will pests be able to invade it. This protection is invaluable to farmers, especially in times when natural resources are scarce and agricultural theft can be a significant problem.

However, you must keep in mind that if you don't keep your promise to feed them pozole regularly (weekly, monthly, or every six months), there will be negative consequences. The aluxes are known to be mischievous and can become vengeful if they feel neglected or disrespected. Stories abound of aluxes causing misfortune and hardship to those who fail to honor their commitments.

Just as you can create them, you can also destroy them because if you die, the Alux will remain in your field and won't allow anyone else to enter it. This aspect of the aluxes' lore underscores the importance of maintaining a respectful and ongoing relationship with these beings. It is not just about invoking their help but also about sustaining a harmonious coexistence.

The process of creating and maintaining an alux is a testament to the ingenuity and spirituality of the Mayan culture. It is a blend of practical agricultural practices and deep-seated spiritual beliefs, showing how intertwined daily life and spirituality are in this context. The stories and rituals surrounding the aluxes offer a window into a worldview where the natural and supernatural coexist and cooperate.

This has been my contribution, I hope it is of interest to you! Sharing these stories is a way to keep our cultural heritage alive and to remind us of the wisdom of our ancestors. The tales of the aluxes are not just folklore; they are a living tradition that continues to influence and inspire those who listen to them. Thank you for taking the time to read about this fascinating aspect of our cultural legacy.
