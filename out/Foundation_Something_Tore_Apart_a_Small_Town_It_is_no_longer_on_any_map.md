When I was 13, I saw something moving in the shadows, and I screamed for my father to come see and get rid of the monster. It ripped him apart. I watched his arms be torn from his body, his skill be split at the jaw, and his spin be slowly pulled out of his body as he was sucked into the shadows. Nothing but blood was left behind. 

No one believed me when I told them what happened. 

My mom refused to deal with me after that; she insisted that I killed him or at least knew who did. I had to raise myself, fend for myself, and live with the memory of my father's murder. 

She was right. I knew what killed him, and he would still be alive if I hadn’t called him. So in that way, it was my fault, and I will live with that for the rest of my life. 

\-

Four days after my 17th birthday, I took my daily trip to the local library. A place I would often hang out after work, and right after I had dinner. I would stay for hours, often until they were getting ready to close. 

One afternoon, while I was reading a book I had read about 30 times, a man approached me. 

\-

“Are you Sky?” He asked me as he tucked his hands into his suit pockets. 

He had slicked-back brown hair and a mustache. I met his green eyes and eyed his suit. Everything he was wearing when we met was black. What stood out to me was how he spoke to me. It was kind and slow, something that I wasn’t used to. 

“That’s me,” I mumbled as I closed my book and flexed my leg a bit, getting ready to get up and move. 

“My name is Simon. I heard about your father, and I would love to have a conversation with you.” He said simply but seriously. 

I was shocked for a multitude of reasons, and perhaps in that moment I should’ve asked more questions. But I didn’t care to know how he knew or where he heard it from. 

“Yeah, okay, let’s talk about it,” I said swiftly as I got out of the chair and put the book back on the shelf. 

\-

We went to a nearby restaurant and he got us a table. He told me to order whatever I wanted, and I did. I made sure to get a complete dinner and dessert. Sitting across from him was weird; it was like sitting with an old friend. I felt comfortable and secure, like I was untouchable and completely protected. 

When the food was delivered to us, I smiled, eager to eat. I ate slowly as he started talking. 

“Your father was killed by a shadow monster?” He asked me as he watched me eat. He sipped an iced tea but didn’t order anything for himself. 

“Yes,” I answered, ready to be laughed at or be called crazy. 

But he didn’t laugh. 

“You’re not the only one who has seen something like this. If you’ll allow me to show you, I will take you somewhere where you will not be looked at as an other.” Simon said seriously as he watched me finish my food. 

I was hesitant for a second and only a second. 

\-

I ended up going with Simon. He explained that no one will know that I’m gone because the space we were going to will remove me from the memories of those who will not need me anymore. I asked him to explain further, and he told me he couldn’t. 

We travelled for four months together before we reached our destination. When Simon parked, he motioned to a large government building that barely caught my attention. The windows were completely black, and there was no logo on the front. No one who walked by turned to walk inside; it was as if they didn’t see the building at all. 

Simon got out of the car and opened my door for me. 

“Head inside, and I will be right behind you.” Simon smiled at me. 

As if I was hearing a calling, as if something was holding its hand out to me, I walked right into the building. No further questions, no waiting, and nothing. Nothing stopped me; I wasn’t scared. But I was confused. 

The building wasn’t decorated, and by all appearances had never been used before. At this point, there was only one set of stairs, and using them took me to what would later become a shared office space. There was no color on the walls, no carpet, and no furniture. I sat there and waited for Simon to come in, but he never did, and to this day, I wonder if I ever really met him at all. 

I slept on the floor for four days and had to use what little cash I had on hand to shop at a store down the street. It wasn’t until day five that a new hallway appeared in the building. 

\-

I watched as the concrete floor slowly, for lack of a better way to describe this, grew black carpet. The walls slowly turned into the most beautiful wood paneling, and I watched as a few windows appeared out of thin air without so much as a sound. But watching the process made me feel high. My head pulsed a bit behind my ear, but aside from that, there was no pain. 

I walked over to the window and leaned on the wall to watch the street below. No one looked up at me, but I watched the world go by without a second thought. I felt weirdly comfortable at this moment, but decided to continue down the hallway after a few minutes. 

The hallway stretched for about 30 feet. Two black elevators sat on the right side of the hallway, and a set of stairs sat on the left side of the hallway. I decided to take the stairs. I will admit that I was a little worried about the elevator. 

I only went up a floor, but it felt like going into a completely different world. The whole building opened up; it had to be bigger than the outside of the building. The area I walked into was large and circular, with stairs going up dozens of floors. The stairs were made out of concrete and had a gorgeous blue trim. 

Dozens of doors littered various locations, some leading to new stairways. Lots of areas had signs overhead, mostly for where the stairs and elevators were. Any other signs were blank. I stood there looking around, trying to take everything in, when I heard a phone ring. 

I quickly moved across the empty floor and swung open a nondescript door, and there it was. A phone booth, something I had only seen in the movies. The booth was baby blue, and the phone inside was a beaming red. As the phone rang, I first fought the urge to answer it. For the first time since I got here, I was afraid. 

I was afraid to push further into the unknown. 

But the ringing didn’t stop. 

Eventually, it felt like it was sliding into my ears and right through my head on repeat. The pain increased until I couldn’t take it anymore. I opened the booth, stepped inside, and took the phone. My arm was shaking so hard that it was hard to keep my grip on the phone. 

\-

“Hello?” I asked slowly, barely able to form words. 

I don’t know what was happening to me; it was like my mind was slowly being overtaken by fear. 

“Sky.” A man said to me in an overly serious tone. 

My grip tightened around the phone. 

“Yes? Who is this?” I asked softly as I leaned on the phone booth. 

“The Collective.” The man said simply. 

“What?” I asked, confused. 

“Sky, when you speak to me, you will not ask questions. You will listen and follow directions; otherwise, we will have to have you replaced. Do you understand?” The man said before the line went silent. 

Replaced? What the hell was that supposed to mean? 

“I…understand,” I whispered. 

I was terrified to ask questions. Something about the way the man spoke made this whole situation feel more real than it had since I got here. This wasn’t a joke, I wasn’t having fun, and for the first time since my dad died, I was longing to go home. 

\-

“You have an office now. I apologize that the space you’re living in wasn’t ready for you when you got there. Until a Director is received, you will be dealing with us directly. Head upstairs to your office and read over the files on your desk. Once that is complete, you will find your car waiting for you in the garage. Money is waiting for you in your office.” He said before the line cut, and I was left shaking in the booth. 

I slowly backed out of the booth and walked down the hallway, back into the open area, and looked around. I had so many questions, but one thing was clear: I had to listen to this man. Every bone in my body was telling me to follow directions, at least for now. 

It took me a while, but I eventually found my office on floor 9. I did explore floor 10, and there was only one room down a long hallway. The plaque above the door read “Director of Foundation.” Floor 9 had five different rooms with no labels. The only reason I knew my office was mine was that my name was right next to the door. 



\-

Walking into the office made my body relax. My eyes fell right to the leather couch, and the first thought that ran through my head was that I was no longer sleeping on the floor. Thick blue carpet ran throughout the whole office. A beautiful wooden desk and a computer waited for me with a black computer chair. 

When I got closer to the desk, I spotted the folder sitting under my keyboard. I sat down in my chair to read. I have redacted portions of the information. 

\-

Subject Location: Redacted 

Subject Information: Kelsey (REDACTED) first spotted the subject in her yard. At first, it would linger outside of her fence line. Her dog, Bacon, would bark at the creature. According to the police report filed, Kelsey and Bacon felt the need to exit the property. It is unknown if they returned home. 

Anomaly: Large bear-like creature with pointed ears that do not match the shape of the creature. The hair on the creature is reportedly thin. Eyes are white pin pricks, as described by Kelsey. The creature has four arms, two larger arms and two smaller arms under the larger two. A creature can turn its head in any direction completely. Kelsey noted in her police report that the creature can turn its head upside down. The creature can mimic sounds and is known to taunt its victims. 

Notes for the Director: This whole section was already redacted. 

There was a sticky note attached to the bottom of the paper that read: “The Collective expects Kelsey to be retrieved and information to be gathered about the creature.” 

I flipped the paper over to continue reading. 

“Though your duties might seem confusing, this task is simple. If Kelsey can not be retrieved, there are others in the folder that you have to find. I know you can do this, and I know you’re confused. Please get started on this assignment after reading this note.” - Simon. 

\-

I couldn’t help but grimace a little reading Simon's name. As I sat there re-reading the information, something caught my eye. A little note sticking out of my desk. As I got up to go find my car, I slid the paper out to read it as quickly as possible. 

“Welcome, Sky. Go along with your instructions for now, but please be careful. Wait for a call from the Coalition or the Board. Once you hear from them, make the choice on who you want to listen to for yourself. Good luck to you.” - Head of Security 

\-

At that point, I was feeling overwhelmed, so I went downstairs. The silence of the building was becoming all-consuming. I was beginning to notice just how alone I was, and that realization was enough to make me clench my fists and start shaking again. 

What the hell was I doing? What would happen if I just drove home? Was I supposed to be here? How did these people know my name? What the hell was I doing here…

Finding my car was easy enough. A nondescript black car with no logo, I could see the keys from the window. As soon as I got inside and started driving to the location on the paper, I started crying. Even as I fiddled with the GPS, I couldn’t help but cry. 

I was so stupid. 

\-

**The Thing In The Woods** 

I drove on and off for four weeks. The GPS was extremely helpful, as was the time outside of the building. It felt good to clear my head and really take in the situation I was in. While I was driving, I thought about trying to contact my mom, but honestly? Even though all of this, she was the last person I wanted to talk to. 

I had so many questions. If someone was able to leave a note at my desk, that means another person had access to the building. But I watched the building grow and change! Though the more I think about it, I really only saw new hallways appear. The rest of the building could’ve been there long before that. 

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. Everything I have ever learned about investigating anything comes from TV. As for the monster? I believe it. I saw a living shadow kill my father, a monster in the woods didn’t sound that far-fetched. By the time I arrived at the location, I knew nobody had been living there for a long time. 

The white fence was torn to pieces and in some spots had started rotting away. As I parked my car and slowly stepped out, the grass crunched under my feet. It was completely dead and withering away. The sun was setting over me, leaving the house in front of me barely illuminated. 

The grass crunching under my shoes made me twitch; I could feel my body shaking again. I walked faster and made my way up the stairs, each one creaking under my weight. One snapped a little; I could hear the wood split, but the step didn’t give way completely. 

As I pushed the door open, I inhaled sharply. Everything was torn apart, large claw marks about six inches thick decorated the floors and walls. The couch was split in two with a pool of dry blood around its base. 

The windows behind me slammed shut. The noise made me jump and spin. 

I could feel sweat running down my forehead and behind my ears. The air felt heavy and was only getting heavier. As I moved around the living room, I examined the broken furniture with interest. 

Everything was broken in various ways. To me, it looked like there was a fight in here, or maybe the monster came through and trashed the house looking for Kelsey? I quickly moved to the stairs and tried to make my way upstairs, but I could see how damaged they were. I backed up and called, “Kelsey?” 

When I didn’t get an answer, I moved to the kitchen and paused. The whole room looked like it had been completely torn apart. A hole in the wall the size of a car caught my attention, and I made my way through the rubble as carefully as possible. 

I hopped through the hole and looked around. Blood littered the dirt and the side of the house. As I looked around further and kicked some rubble with my foot, I paused. A red collar was hidden just under the broken wood. I slowly picked it up and frowned. It was coated in dry blood and a green substance. 

The collar had the name Bacon engraved into it. 

\-

I quickly made my way back to my car and threw the collar into the passenger seat. My shaking hands were barely able to get the car out of the driveway without crashing into trees. 

I drove to the house next door, and it was the same. Rotted over with blood inside, nothing interesting to note. The house across the street was more of the same. I checked five houses before arriving at what I’d consider the main portion of town. 

Most of the buildings here were torn to pieces, and some had completely collapsed. Black cars litter the road, so I have to slow down and maneuver around them. As soon as I saw the police station, I pulled over and got out. I was ready to get some answers, maybe even get some help? 

But no. 

As soon as I got the cracked door open, my nose was assaulted by what I can only describe as rot. I found a dead rat in our yard once; this smell was like that, but worse. I gagged and took two large steps back before turning around to puke. 

I composed myself and slowly made my way into the building. Blood, some fresh, some dry, soaked my shoes. I could feel something creeping into my bones, pure fear. My body was screaming at me to turn and run, and I was going to listen. Kelsy wasn’t here. Everyone here was dead. 

As I turned to go back, I noticed that the door was covered, but only a little. Some light was peeking through the cracks, and at this point, I noticed that the sun had stopped setting. I narrowed my eyes and cocked my head a little. 

Slowly, a pair of white dots appeared just above where the door was. Its face was made out of solid bone, and thin hair covered the majority of its body. But it had thick tufts of hair near its neck and arms. A large, thick tail curled in front of the door; it was the reason I couldn’t see clearly. Its thick legs clung to the wall on either side of the door. Its larger arms held its body up just above the door. I couldn’t see the smaller ones. 

I took a step back. 

My breath started to pick up. 

Tears gathered in my eyes. 

\-

“Mommy, I can’t breathe.” The beast said before it dropped and roared at me. A twisted distortion of a lion's call and the snarl of a dog. 

I screamed. The kind of scream that is fueled by pure, untainted fear. 

As I turned to run, I nearly hit a broken chair. I pushed past the rubble and to the closest set of stairs. I didn’t want to take the time to search for a back door. I could hear the beast chasing me; the floor cracked under its weight. 

I scrambled up the stairs, just as I made it to the top, a few of the steps gave way. I grabbed the railing and pulled myself up as the beast slashed at my leg. It didn’t even have to follow me all the way up to reach me. 

My leg was engulfed in pain; it felt like someone had lit fire under my skin. I put my teeth together and screamed through them as my eyes bulged. My hair fell across my face, and my fingers flexed. I forced myself up and rushed across the floor. My leg was semi-stiff; I couldn’t bend it right. But just in front of me, I could make out a fire escape. 

I pushed a broken desk out of my way, barely as the beast made it up the stairs. 

“Let us out! Why can’t we leave!?” The creature screamed as I glanced behind me. I watched it do a barrel roll to get itself to the ceiling. 

I screamed again and pushed myself out of the broken window. I winced as glass slid into my palms and thighs. As I braced myself to go down the ladder, the creature burst through the wall. If I were any higher, I would’ve died. 

\-

My eyes widened as the fire escape was torn from the building. My world turned upside down, my back slammed off the floor. I yipped and watched the beast slam into the ground near me. As I blinked and felt blood gather at my lips, the sky slowly began to look different. 

I could see the stars, the moon, maybe even other plants. Everything was moving slowly, slower than I ever thought possible. It was gorgeous, a type of raw beauty that you could only see in paintings. 

Blood moved from my lips and down my cheeks as I coughed. I slowly turned my head to look at the police station. It was glowing, a dark purple. But the glow was fading. 

I slowly turned my head as tears poured out of my eyes. I looked at the beast. My body is still shaking, fear still flowing through my body. The lights in the skull were out for a moment. The creature was glowing just like the police station, but the color was more distorted. More black than anything else. 

As I tried to move, I couldn’t help but cry harder; my whole body was shot. I let my head fall to the left as I slowly tried to lift my hand. Blood ran down my hand, and I watched a few drops fall off my finger. 

\-

Before I could process anything further, something took my hand. I coughed, blood landing on different portions of my face. I could barely keep my eyes open. 

A woman was looking down at me, and an orange glow surrounded her body. Her black hair obscured some of her face. 

“Kid?” I heard her say. 

But I could only watch the glow as I faded off. 

\-

When I woke up, I found myself in the back of my car. 

“We have to go back,” I mumbled as I blinked a few times. 

“There is nothing to go back to. We are lucky we didn’t get stuck inside.” The woman said as I moved my hands over my side. My ribs were broken; they had to be, I could feel it. 

“My name is Kelsey-” The woman said as I quickly cut her off. 

“We have to go back to the building. They told me to come and get you.” I wheezed. 

“Set the GPS to Home. Just…please listen to me.” I begged her. Hoping that she didn’t take me to a hospital or something. How would I even explain what happened? 

“Okay,” Kelsey said as I closed my eyes. 

\-

When I woke up next, we were back at the building. I explained everything I could to Kelsey, and in return, she told me why she went back to the town. She described being drawn there and that the feeling wouldn’t go away. 

I asked her if she could go back again, but she told me the GPS wouldn’t accept the address anymore. I assume the town is gone. 

The Collective hasn’t called me yet, and maybe that’s for the best. I have to heal and read over these case files. I have never been so scared in my life, even when my father was murdered; that fear doesn’t compare to anything I experienced over this last week. But I feel a need to push forward, to rip open the unknown. 

As I flip through these files, it seems I am tasked with finding a man named Caleb next.
