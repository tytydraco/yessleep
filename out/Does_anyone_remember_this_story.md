It's been about 9 years since I've heard this story and I am in not a very skilled story writer so bear with me. I also may not get all of the details exactly right. 

I honestly don't even know if this story actually existed and was just made up by the kids I went to school with, but a lot of my classmates used to recite this story an awful lot so I figure it may have come from the internet. All I know is that it used to creep me out. Keep in mind there were a few alternate versions of this story but I'm going to stick to the one I heard the most.

So anyway, it went something along the lines of this:

There is this family of three, a mother, father and daughter. The daughters name was Sally and I don't think the parents were named originally but for the sake of this retelling I will call them Mary and John.  I cannot for the life of me remember accurately the reason why, but there comes a point where Mary and John decide to get rid of their daughter. I may be wrong, but I believe it could have been because of her bad behavioral issues and the fact that she was just a really horrible kid. So anyway, by get rid of I mean they literally take sally to a random location in the middle of nowhere and just leave her there. Again, I'm a little foggy on the details but I'm pretty sure the parents decide to murder her and dump the body somewhere that it won't be found. a bit extreme but to each their own I suppose. So once the body is delt with John and Mary return home and go to bed. 

fast forward about a couple of weeks and the parents are in bed trying to sleep when John is awoken by the faint sound of a voice. Concerned and scared, he gets up to go and check it out. He searches the house but finds nothing and assumes it was just a dream. The following night the same thing occurs but this time the voice is heard by both parents. John explains his experience from the night prior and both him and his wife become increasingly worried that someone may be in their house. Both sit quietly for a moment until they hear the voice again. They begin to realize that the voice is repeating itself every few seconds, though they can't seem to make out what it is saying as it is too quiet. Suddenly the voice stops. John hesitantly scouts the house once again but finds nothing. 

The next night Mary is unable to sleep due to her paranoia about what had happened previously. In an attempt to ease her mind, she checks that all the doors and windows in the house are locked. After getting back into bed and hoping to fall asleep she suddenly hears the voice again. terrified, she quickly wakes her husband. Like before, the voice seems to repeat itself with an interval of a few seconds, though this time it's different. This time the voice has become slightly louder and clearer. John and Mary are petrified when they recognize the voice as none other than Sally's. They sit in fear as Sally's voice softly and repeatedly chants the words "Sally is 70 miles away". After speaking these lines for several minutes, the voice stops once again. John and Mary consider calling the police but ultimately come to the conclusion that this would be a risk as it could get them caught.

From that night onward John and Mary would try their best to ignore the horrifying voice of what seemed to be their own daughter chanting each night. Since the police were not an option, there was really nothing they could do but hope that it was some kind of prank or something. They really didn't know what to believe, there was no way that this could be possible, hearing their own deceased daughter's voice. They had noticed that a family with seemingly troublesome children had moved in next door not long after Sally's death. Mary had witnessed these kids messing around with other people's property before, like damaging mailbox's and such. With this in mind Mary and John hoped that they were just being messed with; however, as time went by and the chanting continued, things only got more unsettling. Each night the voice would get louder and seem closer and would say the same thing but with one small difference every time; it would claim to be closer each night. When the voice first became audible to John and Mary it spoke the words "Sally is 70 miles away" and the night after that "Sally is 60 miles away", and then 50, 40, 30 and so on. By this point both parents would refuse to sleep, staying up all night scared and disturbed as to what they were hearing until one night, it stopped. 

Finally, after a week of listening in horror and being deprived of sleep, Mary and John were able to get some sleep. Things returned to normal and though their experience had left them terrified, the couple tried their best to forget both what had happened and what they had done to their daughter. They had moved on and were living their lives normally.

This was until one night, after several weeks, they heard the voice again. This time it was the loudest and closest it had ever been. John and Mary were in complete disbelief as to what they were hearing. Mary on the verge of tears, yelling out for the voice to stop while John sat silent, too scared to talk. Again, the voice would say it's chant but this time it was different, this time it began with "Sally is at your front door". A few moments later the voice would speak again and say, "Sally is in the kitchen". By this time John and Mary were the most scared they had ever been in their lives, with the covers pulled up to their mouths they sat unable to move looking straight ahead waiting and hoping it would go away. After almost a minute of waiting, the voice spoke again, "Sally is at your bedroom door".

A few weeks later the parents were found dead in their bed covered in blood.

well, that was longer than I thought it was going to be. As I said at the beginning there were a few different versions of this story going around and this one might be pretty modified from the original, but this is the one I was told. Whether this is the actual story or not, it followed the basic premise of this.
