Falling in love with someone is one of the best things that can ever happen. That feeling when you find a person that completes you in every way as if the two of you were destined to meet and become one harmonious whole.

Course that doesn’t always happen. Nine times out of nine you find someone who almost fits into your life. Is almost the perfect person and who you can almost see yourself with twenty years from now. Only for things to eventually change and fall apart.

Things like this are a simple unfortunate fact of life. 

This happened to me and my girlfriend, Julia. 

We’d been together for three years. We’d always been inseparable and obsessive over one another. Indulging in each other's company and never wanting to be apart.

I had by this point picked up on a few of Julia’s more… extreme quirks. But I had always been able to look past her addictive personality and strange episodes. She was my girlfriend and I loved her. And when you love someone even their unsavoury traits become attributes that you look at with a strange fondness. Not for the negative signs themselves but for the whole person they make.

Without Julia’s temper or her opinionated nature or her overly clingy and touchy habits, she wouldn’t be Julia. And I loved Julia.

But it was towards the end of that three year period that I started to feel differently about the woman who I thought I’d spend most of my life with.

I started to notice how much more her strange actions had started to irritate me. Latching onto my arm and refusing to give for almost anything in public spaces, or constantly answering for me or telling me off whenever I said something she didn’t like.

Her positive features as well had also started to grate on me, she made this cute whistling noise while she slept and had a unique way of buttering her bread in a precise square pattern. Things I had once thought endearing now only reminded me of how I couldn’t see her in the same way I once did.

But more than that there were some things she did that I had no explanation for and couldn’t rationalise on any level. Things that set me on edge and made me feel uneasy around the woman I loved. Even if I wasn’t any better for strange interets.

You see, Julia and I had met online through mutual friends in the BDSM community.

I know how that sounds, and trust me, on reflection it probably wasn’t the best place for either of us to try founding a happy and healthy relationship but that was more due to us instead of the practice. If anything it helped build so much trust between us and was half the reason our relationship had been as healthy as it was.

It was always somewhat expected that we’d both be a little on the stranger side. But her mannerisms I’m referring to involved things both in and out of the bedroom and things that I’d never seen anyone else do online or in person.

Firstly, she had a number of weird habits beneath the sheets that I don’t want to get into. It’s not my place to share it here. But one thing I can say was a peculiar ritual she performed both before and after any acts.

She would bind me down and then trace the edges of her teeth along parts of my exposed skin. The underside of my calf, along each finger, across my biceps and more. 

Then out of the bedroom, she has this strange aversion to meat. And I don't mean she’s vegan or obsessed with her dietary intake. I mean she almost exclusively eats raw red meats. There are few experiences I’ve had that can compare to going out to dinner with her and friends at a steakhouse and watching the dainty woman I love tear into a pound of bloody muscle. Coupling these together I often found her caressing food that she was particularly fond of with her teeth in the same way she did to me. Every time I asked her about it she simply brushed me off. Comparing it to a love of food with the cute phrase. “It’s just a thing I do Liam. Like fiddling with hair.”

But even her sickly sweet words couldn’t prevent my suspicions from rising. 

I was falling out of love and it hurt, but it hurt worse because of how she never seemed to notice. Every morning she’d greet me with the same polite smile, her chestnut brown hair falling over her cheeks in soft curls.

“Morning Miel.” 

That was her nickname for me. It’s Spanish for honey. Something that used to hit me like a warm hug that wrapped around my whole body as it lifted me into the day now stuck to my skin with the same sick sweetness as the food she so lovingly referred to me as.

I had been building up courage to tell her how I felt, being nicer to her then usual, buying nice gifts, jewels, dresses, vinyl records and criterion films that she was interested in. I knew that it would be tough to break away from her. But I didn’t want to sever ties, I only wanted to be friends. And I thought that we could still hang out and bond together.

After many weeks of spoiling Julia with gifts and praise I made my move on a cold Saturday night. I had taken her out to a quiet walk along the riverside, watching a small group of swans that drifted past us on our stroll.

She wasn’t gripping to me quite as tight as she normally did on that walk. Instead infatuated with the pattern of two swimming swans. The birds hung close to each other unlike most of the other swans. Standing apart so obviously from the solitary birds.

One black and one white. The contrast was jarring. How one swan was so different from the dark around it and the other was nigh invisible.

I elected to sit the pair of us down on a bench only a few paces away from the birds before I turned to face her.

She was smiling at me and even in the dead of night with the moon shimmering down as our sole source of light she still seemed to radiate a bright warmth that was almost too much to stare at directly. Yet I persevered, knowing what I needed to do.

“Julia.” I started carefully, my throat going dry. “I brought you out here because… well because I needed to talk to you about something serious.”

She nodded frantically in reply, her smile slinking even wider along her face as her eyes winced with anticipation. Hanging onto my every word.

“We’ve been together for what, three years now?”

“Three years, two weeks.” She bowed her head for me to continue, shaking one of her hands as she did so.

“Right.” My voice was on a slight edge that I hoped wasn’t so noticeable as to deter her enthusiasm. I wanted to try and use her high spirits to soften the blow I was about to deal.

“That’s a long time, and I was thinking that maybe…”

“Yes?” She urged me onwards with a rising chime of excitement to her voice that tugged at my heartstrings and threw my mind into turmoil as I gave her the news I had meant to deliver. 

“I think we should split up.”

Her smile faltered with the corners of her mouth twitching uncomfortably as she shook her head and leaned closer to me on the bench. Practically pushing me back against the cold wet wood that stabbed through my jacket.

“What?” Her lips trembling meekly as her hands tightened into uncomfortable bunches that pressed into my chest. I lowered my palms and slowly enclosed her taught fists. Trying to warm that icy tinge that the cold air had impressed onto her skin.

It took me a while to explain everything to her, explaining how I had started to see her differently and how I didn’t feel that it was my place to keep a relationship like this going. She protested, continuously. Almost not comprehending what I was telling her and rebutting my points with painful memories that she tried to serve to me as proof of our love. From a time when I still reciprocated that love. All that did was make this exchange more agonising.  I was struggling to get through to her and in the end it was one little sentence from Julia that broke me.

“I hadn’t met anyone like you…” Her words trailed off as she turned her gaze downward. Considering what to say next with quiet contemplation. I could see that a storm of uncertainty and confusion had slammed through her thoughts. I couldn’t tell what she was thinking but her next words made it almost clear. The way the moon would be if obscured by a slight fog. “I thought you cared about me. We’d planned everything together!” Tears started to well up in the corners of her eyes as she shook her head. She was doing everything she could to prevent herself from crying.

“I know, but I don’t see you like that anymore Julia. I still care so much about you and I don’t want to hurt you. That’s why I need to tell you this.” Her head had been shaking back in fourth in an automated swinging that synchronised with every word. 

“But… But…” Her words were tumbling as she lowered her gaze, her hair falling over her forehead as I could see tears beginning to stream down the sides of her soft cheeks.

“... I thought… I thought yo-you would give me a ring?” I could feel every word she spoke yanking at my heartstrings. I’d lead her on. The gifts, the praises, the meeting at night. I’d been such a moron that I couldn’t see how someone like Julia would take it.

She was a romantic, her mind wouldn’t have even registered the notion of my distance.

Immediately I pulled her into a hug, wrapping my arms around her and gently rocking back and forth as her body was racked with the throbbing shakes of silent, soft cries.

“I’m sorry, I’m so, so sorry.” She was tiny in my arms, we were the same height but I was so much broader as I squeezed her with a gentle and loving embrace. Wanting to imbue the gesture with all the emotion I could muster.

The hug lasted for longer than I expected, minutes ticking by until I started to pull away. Only noticing how my arms seemed to refuse to come undone. A stabbing sharpness in my chest brewed concern in my stomach, a growing flame of worry that was stoked as the acute razor grew in intensity.

I pulled away once more, wrenching my arms away from Julia and looking down at my jacket, below my clavicle where the pain grew.

Her hands, previously bunched, were now unwound in a pair of twisted bony implements that dug deep into the cloth. Nails digging themselves into place and refusing to dislodge.

“Julia, that hurts.” I mumbled lowering my hands to try and remove her hands. My hands touched her wrists and I suddenly felt hot as I was thrown back against the bench, my back slamming into cold wood as water smeared my jacket.

“YOU DON'T GET TO LEAVE!” Her scream came in a bellowing growl that echoed all the way from within her guts, vomiting the words into my eyes as her legs came up. Pinning me down as her nails burrowed ever deeper.

I felt small with her above me. Eyes wild, shining behind her threads of loose hair that obscured her face in shadow. Save for her lips that dripped with spit and revealed twisting and grinding teeth.

I had shrunk as her back arched with primal fury. Never before had I seen her like this. We’d had fights and arguments before and I wasn’t above letting her overpower me. But this was different. Something that came from the very deepest and most personal part of her person. A place that sucked the colour from my face and kept me from crying out. Drawing everything into her in a way that demanded I listen to her. It was magnetic and horrifying. Seeing someone I loved so much snap in a way that I could never imagine any person ever doing.

Then as quickly as it came. Her wrath dissipated. Her face returned to normal as she pulled away. Seemingly releasing how she had acted as she now stood back off the bench. The shadow of herself that had grown over me now retreated back inside of her. Folding away from my frightened eyes as if nothing had even happened.

I sat watching her in silence for a time before she whispered. Her voice almost vanished into the air around my head. Nature itself speaking to me in place of Julia. 

“I’ll make sure you love me, like the old days.” Immediately after she had spoken she turned on her heel and vanished into the dark night around us. Her back fading before I had properly registered what had been said.

Leaving me alone on that cold wet bench, eyes vaguely tracing the outline of that lone white swan. Struggling to determine if there had ever really been two swans at all.



Hours later I was laying on my bed in a cold sweat with one hand holding my phone up to my face and the other vanishing beneath the sheets. Watching the content scroll past my half closed eyes as the beating rhythm of my heart slowly picked up.

The room was muggy and humid. Saturated by a sticky feeling that stuck to my skin and sunk its way into every pore.

The images on the screen continued to burn their way into my mind. Supple skin, shining leather and the sheen of blood drawn that was accompanied by the deafening crack of a whip.

The tension inside my chest rose with every flickering image before it peaked and I collapsed, my body intertwining with the sheets in a loveless embrace. 

Now was when the shame started to sink in. That lonely feeling of disgust and self loathing that always seemed to catch itself in my mind. I hadn’t felt it in so long that I had almost forgotten what it felt like to lay in my own sweat with horse blinders focusing my vision on the disgusting images that lay before me.

I guess I had Julia to thank for that. I regretted leaving her, missing her in that moment where I spent however long staring up at the ceiling for an indiscernible amount of time. The only noises being the banging of neighbours and general clatter of the city’s thrumming life.

It took too long to shake myself out of that stupor. No, no regrets. I couldn’t regret this. Breaking up with Julia was the right thing to do. Our relationship had devolved so much. It was loving but fake and frankensteined together with a thick red thread that was wound so tight around my wrists I thought I might snap.

I couldn’t keep pushing her, even if we both shared mutual interests. I shifted uncomfortably where I lay before standing up and beginning to clean up after myself. Stripping the sheets with lumbering, tired movements of a man who needed rest but had to deny it from himself. With the completion of that laborious task I took a short walk to my bathroom and started to scrub my skin with the brush that I used. The cool water soothing my already reddening skin the brushing was beginning to cause.

My goal was to wash out the humid slather that, even in the pattering embrace of the cold shower, refused to disappear. My scrubbing slowly grew more rigorous as both the events of my night and old memories congealed together. Brewing in a soup that I choked on.

Pictures of tongues, blood, hands and joints. Moving together in unison as the flashing lights burned through our flesh and the glowing silhouette of our physical beings. Casting us prostrated before the empty eyes of soulless onlookers. All the while I watched my tainted form from the ceiling. Everything that made me whole separated and ethereal as a watcher to my own sick and crude pleasures.

The sudden scraping of the brush drawing blood roused me and the memories faded as they had arrived. A hiss escaped my lips as I turned to examine the wound. The soft pink colour of exposed flesh was already releasing blood that shifted from that warm wet life to a diluted washed out pink. It would heal quickly.

Without too much more effort I got dressed and wandered back into the empty mattress in my bedroom and started to assemble the sheets and blankets I felt appropriate for the night's temperature. I was in the process of wrestling the corner of the fitted sheet onto the bed when I noticed something perched on my cluttered bedside table that caught me off guard.

A tingling sensation zipped down my back, cascading in waves that set my hairs on edge and left my muscles tense.

Nestled in a messy but clear crescent pattern on my bedside table were a collection of photographs. Polaroid pictures that seemingly captured a frame within a smaller frame. Photos of me, peering in through the various windows of my first floor apartment. All encircling a slice of cured ham that was slathered in honey.

In the moment I didn’t react at all, I just stared at the odd totem with a growing level of unease and confusion. Imagining in my mind’s eye someone stalking through my house. A slithering shadow that washed over my furniture and cupboards with a silent grace that didn’t disturb anything and leaving nothing to allude to their presence. Nothing except what they wanted to be found.

Then a new slew of ideas hit me and I slowly paced through my home back to the bathroom. Had I left the door ajar? At an angle that wouldn’t have gone noticed when I pulled the door open despite having closed it the full way to shower?

The cold breeze wound around my neck with tension tight enough I thought I was going to suffocate. Frozen in time, standing in a place that I had stood many times before, but now I was considering that someone had come through there while I had been totally unaware. I could almost see through the eyes of that ghost creeping around corners in the dark of my house. Staring at my back through near clear glass as it waited for me to find its shrine.

A shrill beep pierced through the quiet night and I jumped at the noise, revolving to face the source of the disturbance. My pulse steadied once I saw a sliver of blue light slicing its way in a near imperceptible line along the floor from my fridge. The door ever so slightly open.

Off all the things that could have frightened me this felt so mundane that I almost laughed. But the air was still thick with a strange silence that defied any natural quiet of an empty house and I was hanging by a thread that was on the verge of snapping.

Peering around the slight of the fridge and gently pulling it open. Waiting with bated breath for what I expected to be a horrifying sight. 

What I found instead was so much worse. A platter that stood apart from the plastic tupperwares and was lavishly adorned with thick slices of… Watermelon? It was a salad. Of my favourite kind, arranged in the way a florist might adorn a bouquet of blooming roses.

This crown of ripe red fruit that glistened with the sheen of raw beef. Like the honey glazed him from earlier, propped up a single centrepiece that shone with pride. A warm photograph of Julia and I, cuddling together in bed. A heart in red circling the pair of us and our eyes were scribbled over with the same love struck motif.

Seeing that sight made me feel sick to my stomach as I shook my head, reading the words underlining the photo in my head. Although my inner monologue changed and shifted. Becoming less my own voice and instead the sweetened song of my estranged lover.

“Eat well Miel… XXX - Julia."
