This takes place at my family cabin in Oregon, our cabin is in a secluded part of the forest with the nearest neighbor being about 1.5 miles up the mountain on a dirt road. We came to the cabin around the middle of April so we couldn't have a fire due to the wet wood. We drove up to the cabin from north Idaho with my 2 uncles and their kids. My stepdad, I and my brother were there too but nobody else was. The first night was good with activities including drinking beer (soda for me because I was 12 at the time) , shooting at cans with bb guns, and playing poker and other card games. We went to sleep around 10:30 after eating marshmallows for dessert, and spaghetti for dinner. To fully understand the terror of this first appearance of the wendigo/skinwalker you have to know the layout of the cabin, on the left side of the house there are stairs with old Christmas lights on them that we never bothered to get down, then there is a hallway on the second story with the right side being a balcony looking down at poker/eating table and living room, on the left side of the hall there are 3 doors each leading into a bedroom, the first bedroom had one bed and no windows, we don't have an attic so the ceiling of the rooms is 25 - 28 feet high, the second bedroom where me and the other 3 kids sleep, 2 bunk beds 1 normal crappy bed, me on top bunk on right side my brother on bottom bunk and both of my cousins on the left bunk bed.there is one window about 18 feet above the second story so maybe 28 feet high off the ground facing the deep woods with a flat wall of wood.

 Anyways I was laying in bed awake because of my screwed up sleep schedule, when I found myself looking at the treetops illuminated by the moon as I watched a pale creature jump across the window, keep in mind this is on a flat wall 28 feet up with no windowsill. The creature looked like it's blood was all drained with it covered with deep red stains. I naturally as my 12 year old manly self released a scream alternating between not audible noises due to my manly pubescent voice cracks and a high pitched screech. I awoke everyone in the cabin and my oldest cousin (12) fell off the bed (bottom bunk, no severe injury) and 3 minutes later I was being frantically asked what's wrong. I then had to tell 3 adults and 2 kids younger than me about the scary pale naked man 28 feet above the ground covered in blood. They told me it was probably a vivid dream but I told them I was awake the whole time. They told me to get my flip flops on. When we went around the cabin to the back I saw the window and there was nothing there.

The next day I looked up to the back wall and what we failed to notice last night was that there were small scratches the size of pine needles moving diagonally crossing the window moving up towards the roof then they just stopped I had also noticed that a tree limb with deep scratches along the bottom and top had fallen from the tree across from the end of the scratch marks I was naturally gifted at freaking the heck out so I was shook up the rest of that day I noticed that the beer cans we were shooting at were gone, I guessed that the adults had thrown them out because in a field 45 feet away I found one riddled with holes and strange tears. Strange considering we had portable trash cans but who cares. We had a near identical day eating leftover spaghetti and going to bed at 10:45

I went to sleep at about 12:10 but awoke almost instantly at 1:00 wanting a glass of water. I went downstairs and heard tapping on the side door of the kitchen. Absolutely petrified I stood still as a statue as I saw a long bony finger which seemed to have an extra joint tapping on the glass of the door. The wrist of the creature was coming from the bottom of the glass which means it was crouching while tapping on the window.

I walked as slowly as I could up the stairs but when I was around halfway up the stairs the tapping stopped. I stood as still as I could while there were steps moving around the cabin to the back where I heard scratches going up preceded by a bloodcurdling scream from my room. Apparently my youngest cousin was awake when I woke up to get water and they heard the scratching and also saw a creature run up the window. We left the cabin the third day because it was memorial day weekend. We found the bars on our window bent, our window had bars because last year a bear broke the window in search of food. Notably the bars had to be bent using a vice and a hammer, also notably the way the bars were bent was like the thing that bent them pushed them up to the window. That means that this pale monster with the 5 joint fingers was stronger than my considerably strong uncle. The adults never told us but apparently they had come up to replace the furnace and replace the bars, this was later into the year and they were able to have a fire. That one night they were there it felt like they were constantly being watched. They also heard strange tapping on the side of the house. They said it was the wall creaking but ever since I have never slept easily at that cabin. We had later sold the house and I have never had a paranormal experience since.
