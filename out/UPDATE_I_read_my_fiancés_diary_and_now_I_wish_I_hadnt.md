The nightmares began on her sixth birthday.

Alazne woke me in the dead of night, pale and wide- eyed. I hugged her. “Sweetheart, what’s wrong?”

“Mommy, I don’t like the bad lady.” she whimpered, burrowing into my shoulder. “Make her go away!”

My heart skipped a beat. “Bady lady? What bad lady? What did she look like?” she must’ve heard the frantic tone of my voice, because she trembled slightly. 

“She’s all in white and she’s *screaming*.” Alazne whispered. I clutched her to me and slid my legs out of bed. Heart in my mouth, I slowly made my way down the hall and to Alazne’s room, peering through the crack of the door. Nobody was there. 

I heaved a sigh of relief. “You’re okay, love. Nobody’s in there”. I laid her back down to sleep and went back to my room. When the nightly scratching resumed, I wandered around our house and tried to think of anything but Seb and his brutal death.

At 3am, I caved. Taking the advice of a kind redditor, I booked a psychologist appointment, then flicked through texts on my phone. A message, from an unknown number, awaited me.

*Hello, Ever. I am Detective Alva Johanessen, of [City] Police Department. Investigations of your husband’s murder have resumed and I would like to speak with you if possible regarding his tragic death.*

I swallowed. Hesitated, fingers hovering over the keyboard. Then I typed out *Well could you help me out?*

*I’m sure we could come to an agreement*

I sucked in a shaky breath. *I’d like police reports concerning Rachel Allen’s disappearance and murder as well as Violeta Iriye Serens’ death.*

*I’ll see what I can do. Call me back in a few days*

“Mommy?”

My head snapped up. Alazne stood silhouetted in the dark doorway, a ray of moonlight hitting her face, illuminating it in an eerie glow. She swayed slightly on her feet.

“Mommy, I’m cold,” she whispered. Fear gripped me like a vise. I ran to her side and enveloped her in my arms. As I opened my mouth to speak, she cut me off. “What’s that?”

“What’s what, Alazne?”

She tilted her head to one side. “The *scratching*”

*No!* I whirled around. This was the first time she heard it, ever. Did that mean *it* was affirming it’s hold on us once more? Swallowing down my fear as best I could, I tried to reassure her.

“Oh, that’s just the neighbour’s puppy! Don’t worry about it.”

“Oh,” she said thoughtfully. “Okay.”

Later on, as I scrolled through my previous posts on Reddit, I came across an intriguing comment. It said the creature seemed to need a witness to kill somebody…

I sucked in a breath. *If they’re right…*

But how could I do that? I may be able to survive utterly alone, but my daughter could not. And even if she could, how cruel would I be to condemn her to a life of eternal secrecy?

*But… if the creature needs a witness, then if it kills me, Alazne, or Ally as I call her, will be spared, at least for a little longer. I would gladly give all that I own, up to my own life, for her.I just hope in my final moments I will possess all of Seb’s selfless love and seamless grace.

I shuddered. *Please, let it be quick, when it happens*.

The same evening, Alazne walked home with her new friend, Mike from a few doors down. As soon as she burst through the front door she jumped into my arms, giggling.

“Ally!” I laughed, spinning her around. “How was school?”

“Teacher told me I make up too many stories!” she exclaimed, grinning impishly. I chuckled and set her down on the couch. 

“Really? Well, *I* don’t think so! What did you say to her?”

“Well, I heard the neighbour’s doggie scratching at the school walls too! But she didn’t hear it. She said I was telling silly stories.”

Words cannot describe the horror of that moment. I froze, my pulse racing at a million miles an hour, struggling to stay calm. *It* had followed her. My daughter. My Ally. I swore to Seb I’d give her a good life. I couldn’t fail her now.

I smiled through the tears blurring my vision. “Why don’t you go on up to your room, sweetie? I’ll have dinner ready in a few.” I kissed the top of her head and tried to look more serene than I felt.

As I chopped onions and minced garlic, all I could think of was Seb and his untimely end. My head spun and I genuinely thought I might be sick all over. I wouldn’t, *couldn’t*, let that happen to my Ally. I would die a million deaths before I let it kill her.

But I knew deep down that when the day came, it was out of my hands. Only *it* had the power to decide who lived and who died.

Desperate, I dialled Detective Alva.

“Hello?”

“Hi. It’s, um, Ever Serens. I’m calling about…”

“I know. I have the documents, hon, just let me know where I can contact you. And about that interview?”

“Anytime.” I said. “Name a place and a time, I’ll be there.”

“Alright!l she sounded surprised. “I’ll see when I’m available.” I gave her my number and she sent me the documents.

*Transcript of Interview With Rachel Allen*

*DH: Detective Harrison here. We are now recording.*

*RA: Okay. Thanks.*

*DH: So, Rachel, could you talk us through the events of Saturday, August 4 1985?*

*RA: I woke up alone, as usual. Jensen was out hunting no doubt. It was maybe around 10pm. I went downstairs for a glass of water and Carl was asleep in his room when I went to check in  on him. He was very still. I went back to bed and woke around 12, Jensen came in. I sat up and all of a sudden he was screaming. He came in and pinned me to the bed, on the phone with 911. I was crying and trying to push him off of me. He didn’t tell me what was happening.*

*DH: So, he held you down? Did he do anything else besides that, touching, shoving, verbal abuse? Was there anything sexual?*

*RA: No. He always seemed disgusted by me. We rarely touched or kissed. I only ever got pregnant once, with Carl, due to his parents pressuring us.*

*DH: Did you love Carl?*

*RA: Wow, um, this is a tough one. No. There was no kinship between us, due to my MIL essentially forcing me to get pregnant. I was fine with him being around, I guess. That’s all I can really say.*

*DH: Thank you for your honesty, Rachel. Can you tell me more about your relationship with Jensen?*
*RA: Well, he was sort of… absent. He went hunting all day, even after we were married, and came home late at night, often not at all. We never tried to properly care for one another. I considered him more of a roommate.*

*DH: And did that change after Carl was born?*

*RA: Yes and no. Our relationship got worse by the day, but he fucking *adored* Carl. Took him out hunting pretty much as soon as he could walk. Made me sell my own clothes to buy him a new bed.*

*DH: And did you ever… do things you shouldn’t have to spite your husband?*

*Silence*

*RA: Yes. But I didn’t kill our child.*

The transcript ended suddenly. I shuddered, wrapping my arms around myself. It was a messed up tale all- around. My heart ached for the young couple that was so suddenly and miserably thrown together, and Rachel especially, pregnant with a child she didn’t want. *It’s inhuman. She never deserved so much pain.*

The media at the time had been too quick to paint Rachel Allen as a cruel, careless woman; despite all that she suffered, I find it hard to believe she would kill Carl. They also never mentioned how *none of it would even have happened* if she wasn’t made to get pregnant and have a child she couldn’t love. Ffs.

I called my daughter down. Ally was bouncing up and down excitedly.

“Mommy, can I go play with the puppy? He’s outside again! Pleaseeee!”

“No! Alazne, you’re not allowed to, okay?” 

“Okay,” she pouted. I smiled and grabbed a sweet for her, which she snatched away eagerly and darted off giggling. I turned back to my screenand the transcripts Alva sent me.

*Coroner’s Report of Jensen Serens’ Death*
[TW] VIOLENCE | DEPICTIONS OF GORE

*Post examination, the coroner, Honoré Smith, determined that Serens suffered 5 lacerations of around 10cm in legnth to the chest and back, a laceration of about 35 centimeters to his left arm and his right arm was severed at the elbow. The victim’s neck was sliced, resulting in a severed carotid artery, although the victim eventually perished of blunt force trauma to the head and stomach. The coroner describes his injuries as being consistent with a hate crime, with the intent to make the victim suffer as much as possible.*

I felt sick to my stomach. Was this to be my fate…. or Alazne’s? No, I couldn’t let that happen.

That night, the scratching escalated into downright clawing just below Ally’s window. I made her sleep in my room and camped out in the hallway all night, trembling every time I heard the faintest noise.

I wondered how I could protect Alazne. The creature needed a witness… so all I could do was have her hide and shift the attention to myself. Then she would become the witness, and I… the victim.

The next morning, as Alazne walked to school (which was located just down the orad) with her friend- Mike- I wondered if the creature was… Rachel herself? It would explain the creature’s hatred for Jensen and Seb. But why me? Why Ally?

I sighed, leaning back against the counter. And what about Violet, how did she affect this? Butbif she truly was so loving why would she go after Seb?

My head spun with all the info. Then something clicked.

I recalled an old legend my aunt used to tell me; the Wendigo. Once human, it had cannibalized other humans and been turned into a creature as terrifying as it’s soul.

I thought of Rachel. She was last seen around Wilson Wood, but why? Had Jensen done something to her? Tried to kill her? What if…

What if *Jensen* was trying to poison Rachel and Carl had eaten/drank the poison instead. Then she would’ve realised how dangerous he truly was.

After Violeta’s car wreck, the bodies of herself and her husband were never found. Maybe Jensen hid them? It was already clear to me by now that he somehow managed to have them killed and to take Seb as a replacement son. *And* they crashed near Wilson Wood.

What if Rachel was lost in the deep woods and happened upon their bodies? And, in her desperation, near- starving, ate them? Was turned into a Wendigo, thus leaving behind her human body? 

I started to sob.

I needed to get Alazne safe somehow, somewhere. The creature- Rachel- was pitiless. What’s more, she would start to be afraid- I couldn’t fool her for long with my “Oh, it’s just the neighbour’s silly puppy” story.

Then the phone rang. I snatched it up, pressing my ear to the receiver. “Ever Serens here, hello?”

“Miss Serens, this is Officer Ortíz. Your neighbour, Mike Kyson, went missing while walking to school with your daughter, Alazne Serens. Come take her home, she’s very shaken up.”

I was horrified. Was Alazne the witness in his attack? No doubt Rachel got him too. I jumped in the car to get her.

The boy had vanished suddenly and with no trace, though there were signs of a struggle. Alazne seemed disturbed, and barely did anything anymore: she sat around all day, crying silently. She grew frighteningly sickly.

“Honey,” I whispered one night, drawing her to me. I stroked her hair. “Did something happen with Mike?”

She shook her head, sobbing harder.

“Don’t be scared, you can tell me,” I coaxed, and she gripped me fearfully.

“I just wanted to play with the puppy,” she wailed.
