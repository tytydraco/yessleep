It started innocuously enough—like most plagues do. A new drug hit the streets. They called it Noctyra. At first, it was marketed as a simple, designer hallucinogen. The kind of thing people took to escape reality, to feel free, to feel infinite. Everyone thought it was just another fleeting trend in a world already saturated with escape mechanisms. But no one had any idea what was waiting just beneath the surface.

My name is Michael Kendrice. I work for the government in research and development, part of a special task force investigating new substances, particularly those that might pose a threat to public safety. Before Noctyra hit the streets, I’d never heard of it. When the first reports came in, they seemed trivial: “People tripping on a new psychedelic. Strange visual distortions. Nausea. Minor confusion.” Nothing unusual. After all, society was already drowning in a sea of legal highs and designer drugs. But I’ve learned—painfully, tragically—that things are never what they seem.

What made Noctyra stand out wasn’t just its mind-altering effects. It was the way it warped reality itself. At first, it was small things. Billboards, TV commercials, music videos—things began to change. The messages became subtly sinister. Subtle at first, then more overt: “Embrace Chaos.” “Pledge your soul to Lucifer.” “Sacrifice for the Antichrist.” At first, people thought it was just part of the drug’s hallucinatory effects. But as the drug spread, it became impossible to ignore.

People who took Noctyra saw Noctyra everywhere. The entire world began to shift. The buildings themselves seemed to pulse with an unholy energy. Signs were warped into grotesque depictions of demonic symbols, while the TV blared messages urging followers to “give everything to the Dark Lord” and “take up the sword of fire.” Music that was once popular and harmless began to twist into chants of praise to Lucifer, exhorting listeners to “embrace the chaos” and “sacrifice the innocent.” The media, the advertisements, even the food packaging—it all pushed the same agenda. You couldn’t escape it. It was everywhere. Every billboard, every street corner, every TV screen, all pointing towards one thing: surrender.

As a government official, I was supposed to be keeping the situation under control. At first, we tried to isolate the drug—track down where it was coming from, who was behind it, how it was spreading. But the deeper we dug, the more horrifying the truth became.

It wasn't just a drug. It was a vector. A parasite.

The parasite was the key. It was engineered to infect and manipulate the mind. Once ingested, it infiltrated the brain, changing the way the world was perceived. People didn't just get high on Noctyra. They became infected. And once they were infected, they were hooked. The parasite, or what we eventually identified as a highly evolved form of mind-controlling nanobots, reprogrammed the brain to see everything—everything—through a lens of chaos and evil. It turned every thought, every feeling, every instinct towards destruction and darkness. For those on the drug, the world became a canvas for Satan’s reign.

I was one of the first to see it up close. My own family. My wife, Clara, and my daughter, Emma—they lived in the city when the outbreak hit. At first, I didn't understand why they weren’t answering my calls. Clara had always been cautious, aware of what was happening in the world around her, but she didn’t see the danger in Noctyra. Like everyone else, she thought it was just another fad.

I remember the last time I spoke to her. It was just after a meeting with my superiors. The government had finally acknowledged the full scale of the problem. We had no choice but to lock down the city. The infection was spreading faster than we could contain it. But that was when I learned the truth: Noctyra was planted everywhere. People were lacing food, drinks, and medicine with it. They wanted to spread the plague. Every time someone took the drug, they recruited another. Noctyra was a cult—a web of darkness that stretched through every corner of society.

I called Clara. The phone rang once, twice, and then she picked up. But it wasn’t her voice that answered.

“Michael, you need to embrace it,” her voice was different. Hollow. Dead. “The time has come. The Antichrist is here. We are chosen. You will join us in the flames.”

“Clara? What are you talking about?” I couldn’t breathe. My heart was pounding. “It’s the drug, isn’t it? Noctyra. You’re on it. I’m coming for you. We can leave. We can get out of the city, just—”

“No,” her voice cut through, sharp and clear. “There is no escape. There is only one way. The blood of the innocent must be spilled. You’ll see. You’ll know.”

The phone went silent.

And that was the last time I heard her voice.

I knew what had happened. The parasite had infected her. She was no longer my wife. She was a puppet, a slave to a far darker power. But the terror didn’t stop there. When I arrived at the gates of the city, I was stopped by military personnel, my own colleagues. They told me I couldn’t leave. I was trapped. They’d received orders from higher up to seal the borders, quarantine everyone inside the city limits. The infection was spreading too fast. And we hadn’t even begun to understand the full nature of the parasite.

It wasn’t just the drug, the Noctyra; it was everyone. Everyone who had taken it had become part of a hive mind, a massive cult dedicated to Lucifer’s reign on Earth. The infected had begun organizing—setting up "rituals" in the streets, slaughtering anyone who resisted the call. It didn’t matter how much we tried to stop it. They had one goal: to ensure the rise of the Antichrist.

But the worst part? I realized that I was already infected. The parasite was in me too. I could feel it crawling beneath my skin, like a burning itch in the back of my mind, urging me to join them. To embrace the chaos. To sacrifice anyone I could.

The authorities had put the city on lockdown, but we were already too late. The parasite was in the water, in the food, in the very air we breathed. Anyone who was still uninfected was now a prisoner, unable to escape, sentenced to live in this hellscape for the rest of their lives.

I’ve tried to fight it, I really have. I’ve tried to maintain some semblance of control over my thoughts, over my mind. But I can feel it slipping. The darkness is taking hold. Every day, I see more of them—more people who’ve become part of the cult. They don’t even look human anymore. Their eyes are hollow, their faces twisted in permanent grins, and every word they speak is a command from Lucifer.

I’m writing this to you because I don’t know what else to do. If you’re reading this, I hope you can understand. If you’re still safe, still out there, run. Don’t go near anyone who’s taken the drug. Don’t trust anyone who’s infected. It spreads like wildfire. Once you see it, once you feel the pull of the dark, there’s no turning back. The world has become hell, and I fear we are all its damned inhabitants now.

And if you hear a voice whispering your name in the night, calling you to the chaos, to the sacrifice—don't listen. It’s the parasite. It’s the Antichrist. And it’s coming for all of us.
