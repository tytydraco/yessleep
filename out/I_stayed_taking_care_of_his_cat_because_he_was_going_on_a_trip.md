It was 7 in the afternoon when I arrived at his house. The sky was a mixture of soft oranges and purples as the sun began to set, casting long shadows over the quiet neighborhood. I had agreed to take care of his cat for a day while he was away on a short business trip. The house was an old but well-maintained two-story building with a cozy appearance. It had a wooden front door, slightly creaky, and a small porch with a rocking chair that moved slightly with the breeze.

As I stepped inside, the scent of lavender and wood polish filled my nostrils. The interior was warm and inviting, with wooden floors that creaked slightly under my weight. The house had two bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, while the ground floor consisted of a spacious kitchen and a dining area. The furniture was antique, giving the place a rustic charm. The cat, a fluffy gray tabby with piercing green eyes, greeted me with an indifferent glance before stretching lazily on the couch.

As time passed, the house grew quieter. By 9 at night, the darkness outside had fully set in, and the soft hum of crickets could be heard through the slightly open window. I decided it was time for dinner, so I made my way to the kitchen to prepare some hamburgers with noodles. As the aroma of sizzling meat filled the air, the cat sat nearby, staring at me with an unreadable expression. I chuckled, assuming he was just waiting for a taste of the food.

However, as we ate, I noticed something strange. The cat's gaze shifted away from me and fixed itself on a specific spot on the wall. There was nothing there—no pictures, no shadows, no movement. Just an empty space. Yet, the cat remained completely still, its eyes locked onto that spot, its tail flicking slightly as if sensing something I could not. A shiver ran down my spine, but I brushed it off as my imagination playing tricks on me.

After finishing my meal, I decided to go upstairs to use the bathroom. The moment my foot landed on the first step, I heard it—footsteps. Slow, deliberate, echoing through the staircase ahead of me. My heart pounded as I froze in place. There was no one in the house but me and the cat. The footsteps continued, reaching the top of the stairs before fading into silence. The air grew heavy, the kind of silence that presses against your ears and makes you hyper-aware of your surroundings.

I turned around, looking for the cat. When I found him, he was still sitting in the same spot, but now his gaze was fixed on the staircase. I didn't need any more convincing. Grabbing my things, I scooped up the cat and hurried to the front door. The bathroom could wait—I wasn’t going to go upstairs. Not after that.

As I stepped outside into the cool night air, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Whatever was in that house, I wanted no part of it.
