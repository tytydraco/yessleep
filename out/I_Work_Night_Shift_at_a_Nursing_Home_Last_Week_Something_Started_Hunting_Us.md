It was a calm afternoon in autumn. I was walking along the river towards the nursing home near the edge of the city. I always had night shifts on mondays, but I didn’t mind. I actually liked my job quite a lot, the residents were very nice and I really felt like I was having a positive impact on their lives. Whenever I didn’t have to care for a resident, I played board games and talked with the people living here. They loved the company of me and my coworkers.

I arrived at the front door and showed my ID to Jim, our security guard. “Wonderful sunset today!“, I cheerfully greeted him. He answered with a warm smile and held the door open for me. Upon entering, I put my coat in a locker and headed for the staff conference room, where the dayshift always gave the nightshift important information about the day. Most of the time, the most important information was the weather forecast for the morning. 

This time, it was different. Diana, a colleague working part time while attending university, told me that Miss Strauss had trouble sleeping last night because she heard footsteps outside on the corridor all night. This was probably due to a pipe leak in a nearby bathroom, the water dripping on the floor could almost be mistaken for footsteps. 

After chatting a bit, the dayshift started leaving. I was left with two other nightshift colleagues. Normally, we would be five, but the others had called in sick, so we had to work a bit harder tonight. 

After doing a routine check on all residents, I headed for the dining room along with most others. I talked to a group of old ladies about the latest celebrity gossip, as well as Mr Garcia who proudly presented me with the scarf he had crocheted over the last couple of days. It was always very nice chatting with these wonderful people.

I saw Miss Strauss in the corner of the room and sat down next to her. She looked exhausted and a bit frightened.  I tried to start a conversation to distract her, but she stayed silent. After sitting there for a minute, she started talking. Her hand was twitching. She insisted that she heard footsteps the night before. Erratic footsteps running across the hallway and back, multiple times every hour. I tried to calm her down and even offered to stay with her this night, but she declined and went silent again. Disheartened, I went back to the other residents for the rest of the evening.

After most residents went to sleep, I sat down in the lounge to read. Even though we were understaffed, there was surprisingly little to do tonight. I managed to read about forty pages before I heard something. 

Distant sounds, irregular, moving on the floor above me like someone stomped with heavy hiking shoes. The sounds were moving quite fast and were gone in only a few moments. I didn’t think much of it and continued reading. 

Thud.

There it was again. I placed my book on the table next to me and started walking towards the staircase. Upon reaching the first floor, I peeked into the hallway. Nothing. I slowly walked along the doors. I was almost at the end of the hallway when I noticed a slightly open door. It was dark inside. Goosebumps started appearing on my arms.

When I turned on the light, I saw Mr Garcia lying on the bed, unnaturally pale. A shiver went down my back and I quickly looked over my shoulder, but I was alone. I was walking up to his bed when I noticed his neck.

He had a nasty, round hole in his neck, with an outline that resembled an unnaturally large bite mark. I put my shaking hand over my mouth and pressed the emergency button which alerted my colleagues. 

I tried to feel the pulse of his fragile arm, but there was none. Not just a missing pulse, but no blood. His veins felt flat and empty, and his entire body lacked any color, like he was sucked dry.

But the worst thing was his his stomach. Something had ripped big chunks of flesh out of the side of his belly, and parts of his intestines were falling out.

Luckily, no residents woke up during the night, so we gave an announcement in the morning that Mr Garcia had unfortunately passed away in his sleep. We didn’t want to cause concern, but we knew. Someone. Something killed him.

During breakfast, Miss Strauss told me that she heard the erratic footsteps again, running towards Mr Garcias room. I comforted her again, but deep down, I started to believe her. The sight of his lifeless body had burned itself into my brain and haunted me for the entire day, even when I went home.

I returned the next night with a cold sweat on my body. The evening went normally, but when the residents went to their rooms, I was scared. I felt watched constantly. 

Suddenly, a red light came on in the lounge, signaling that a resident had pressed the emergency button. It came from miss Strauss. I ran upstairs and threw the door open, finding her sitting on the ground. 

“Un- under my bed…“ she stuttered. “I found it when I dropped my glasses…“.

I slowly lied down to look underneath her bed. I gagged. 

Under the bed was a human hand, severed by what seemed like brute force. I crawled back from the bed shivering. Moments later, my colleagues, who also saw the emergency light, arrived. They were just as shocked and confused as I was.

We did not immediately find out who the hand belonged to, but one resident, Mr Taylor, was missing entirely and nowhere to be found. 

After this incident, the stories quickly spread throughout the nursing home, and some residents temporarily moved to their families. The other two nightshift colleagues quit, but I stayed. I did not feel comfortable with leaving the rest of the residents alone, they were relying on the staff taking care of them.

Especially Miss Strauss seemed more distressed than ever, and I constantly had to calm her down. She told me that she even started hearing the footsteps during the day now. 

Soon, I started looking behind my back nervously every minute, always expecting something charging at me in the hallways. I was scared of empty rooms, mirrors, corners where I could not see the other side. 

During the night, I also started hearing the footsteps more regularly, often accompanied by creaking doors, as if something was looking for the remaining residents.

Then, at 4 am, I needed to bring a resident his medicine. I went up to the first floor when I heard the footsteps again, followed by the creaking wood of a door. I looked around the corner. 

A Scream tore through the silence of the night.

It came from Miss Strauss. I burst through the door.

Miss Strauss looked like she would have a heart attack any second. Her right arm was covered in blood. 

I quickly looked around, but I only saw an empty room. But an open window. I sat down on the bed and asked her to breathe with me to calm down. After 10 minutes, I asked her to tell me what happened.

She described a pale, hairless creature with unnaturally thin and long limbs sneaking through her door with blood dripping out of its mouth. 

The creature had climbed on the ceiling over her bed, while the blood dripped down on her arm. Just when it tensed up to jump at her neck, it suddenly crawled towards the window when I came towards her room.

I was very relieved that the blood on her arm wasn’t hers, but I soon realized that it must have come from somewhere. Someone.

I frantically checked every room until I found the source. Jeff, our security guard, was lying inside the broom closet of the first floor. His pale arms were pointing away from his body in unnatural angles. His mouth was wide open in a silent scream. 

I slowly walked backwards. It was too much. I wanted to get out of there, even if there are still other residents left. The dayshift would take care of them. 

I ran towards the exit, pushing an emergency door open. I heard the buzzing of the door alarm, but I ignored it. I ran across the grass of the courtyard towards the street, when a wave of guilt hit me.

I was thinking about Miss Strauss. I would leave her alone if I ran away.

I stopped and looked back towards her window on the left side of the building.

I saw her standing at the window, blood dripping from her mouth with an unnaturally wide smile.
