When I tell people that both of my parents disappeared when I was little, their reaction is usually one of wide-eyed shock. They say “Tell us more!” like they expect the story to be some dramatic true-crime mystery. I didn’t ever think it was. 

I don’t know very much about my mother and father. I know that when they vanished, my mother was 21 and my dad was 23. I know they weren’t married, and I don’t outright know but I’m pretty certain I was an accident. They lived in an apartment my grandparents paid for.  My dad worked as a security guard at the hospital while mum stayed at home with me. My parents were only with me for the first seven months of my life. 

Nobody knows exactly what day it was that my parents vanished. Only that on the 2nd of September, somebody walked past our apartment, heard my screaming and called the cops for a welfare check. The police arrived and discovered that I had been left all on my own. 

My parents' vehicle had gone missing too, as well as their credit cards. They hadn’t taken their passports, any toiletries or any change of clothing, so it didn’t appear they actually planned on running away altogether. They found out that my dad had missed work 3 days in a row and there were dozens of unanswered voicemails from his job on our answering machine. 

I became known as the “Miracle Baby” because I survived three days on my own. I was probably filthy and had the mother of all diaper rashes but all the same I was alive and managed to scream so hard that somebody found me. It was pure dumb luck that somebody heard me through the door of that locked apartment. 

The local press pushed my story for a couple of months, and implored people to call in any sightings of my parents. Several searches were conducted in nearby lakes for my parent’s car. At the end, it was back to square one. They never found the car, they never got any sightings, and they sure as Hell never found my parents. 

What a lot of people ask me is “What do you think happened?” and I’ve always found that a little hard to answer. I’m sure my parents struggled with looking after me. They were young and never really wanted a child. I used to think it must have reached a point where they just decided they couldn’t take it anymore and walked out on me. It was a little hard to believe that, because essentially they left me to die. They could have dropped me off on a doorstep, or with a family member. But they just left me alone, they just left me to scream it out. 

There was a possibility my parents just went out for a late night drive, got into some sort of terrible accident and have just never been found. The theory I used to come back to was that they committed suicide, or maybe there was a murder-suicide. I suppose it makes sense if they were completely past caring about anything in their lives that they would leave me like that. 

The one thing I never believed was that there was any foul play. That wasn’t because I didn’t want to believe it, but because I truly didn’t think that could have happened. My father was 6’2, for starters, so I don’t understand how someone could have actually abducted my parents. Or for that matter, why? There was no evidence that my parents used drugs or that they were involved with anything shady. I’ve also never believed that there are crazed lunatics stalking the streets trying to abduct and kill young couples. 

But that’s what everybody says to me “But what if they were abducted? What if they were murdered?” And I just don’t engage with that. 

The way my life started out was tragic but my life was never really sad or difficult since then. I was adopted after the ordeal. I was originally just going to live with my grandparents, but somebody else stepped in and begged to adopt me.  

Her name was Mariah, and she is what is known as a philanthropist. Her father was a millionaire and she was a socialite. She had more money than she ever had things to spend it on, so she spent most of it on children’s charities. The most I knew about her charity work was that she made visits to children’s homes and bestowed Playstations and junior designer clothing on the orphans. She adopted a few other kids throughout my childhood, but I believe I was the only baby. 

Mariah wasn’t as good at raising children than she was at dressing them up. She never really felt like a mother to me, nor did the other children feel like siblings. I was mostly looked after by staff, and Mariah only spent time with me at charity fundraisers. It was clear I was just a status symbol and she only took me in because she wanted to show off the Miracle Baby. 

I was usually forced to stand around at these events with two other kids who started out as abandoned infants; Baby Lavender Jade and Baby Boy Jack. I hated Baby Boy Jack, he was so arrogant and he was always a complete tool to me. He always made fun of me because my parents kept me initially and decided to abandon me later, he’d say they got sick of me. Lavender always stood up for me and I really liked her, but she was always a little strange, very sullen. 

I hated going to events, but I did like living in a gorgeous house and going to private school. I got anything I asked for. I liked my childhood, everything always felt like an adventure. I knew there was something missing, though. I never felt I was part of a family. Once I went away to college, my relationship with Mariah pretty much ended. I tried to call her to let her know how I was doing but she’d always sound like she didn’t want to talk to me and she’d just ask if I needed money or something. 

It had been a long time since anybody gave a damn about the Miracle Baby.  I’ve never felt the need to hide my name, and I’ve never really been bothered by anybody about what happened. I was really surprised when I saw an email in my inbox with the subject line “Miracle Baby”

I wondered if maybe it was the person who called the cops and had me saved, if they finally wanted to get in touch with me. The papers never reported their name, and I’d always wanted to meet them to thank them for saving my life. 

"Dear Drew," it read "I can’t imagine what your life has been like without parents, not knowing where your parents are and why they left. So, for you, I created something. I’ve decided to give you some time with your parents, this is what your childhood with them would have been like."

There were three video files attached. As you can imagine, I was sickened. I didn’t know who this person was, their email handle was larrow02172, it didn’t really give me a clue on their name or their organisation. I never asked them to reach out to me, yet they felt the need to intrude on me like this. I wasn’t sure I even trusted the videos enough to watch them, they might have been something illegal. I decided to ignore the entire email, but I couldn’t help but go back.

Late at night I opened one of the videos and watched it spring up in QuickTime Player. I took a deep breath and pressed play. 

The video showed a man’s face looking into the lens, and he stepped backwards before turning the camera around to focus on whatever was behind him. A woman was lying down on the couch, a young woman with short dark hair and a round face. My mother. I put my hand over my face. I’d seen the pictures of my parents tons of times. I was certain that was her.  

“Where’s Drew?” The man behind the camera said. 

“He’s probably playing with the taps again” 

When I was little, I played with the taps a lot. I’d always wind them round and make water spill everywhere. I can’t have done that before I was seven months old though. My heart started to thud a little. The man walked through the hallway and I recognised that this was exactly like the apartment they abandoned me in. I requested all the photos a few years ago. The wallpaper was green and yellow with a distinctive criss-cross pattern. The photos on the walls even looked to be exactly the same. If this video wasn’t real, they replicated the apartment perfectly. 

The man opened the door to the kitchen and a little boy was standing over the sink, turning the taps at his own free will, laughing away. He looked to be about 4 or 5 years old. 

“You stop that, you little menace!” The man said jokingly. The little boy turned his head around and grinned.

He was me. That was exactly what I looked like at that age, even down to the freckle under my nose. I put my hands over my face completely. This was sick. 

“Get in here, Julie!” The man yelled, and my mum walked back into the room. She took the camera from him and laughed as he picked me up and whirled me around. It was apparent that not only had they perfectly replicated my mother and me, but they replicated him too. He perfectly resembled the photos I’d seen of my dad. The video ended there.

All I could do was cry. However they’d done this, whether it was with actors or editing or whatever kind of trickery, they had done it to taunt me. They’d gone through all this effort just to remind me that my parents were gone. I didn’t understand how somebody could be so sick. Maybe they wanted to make me feel better like they said, they must have known this would hurt me. 

A part of me wanted to get angry and lash out at whoever sent me this, but another part of me wanted to see more. I had never seen my parents in motion. I’d never heard their voices. I knew it was all fake, but this was probably the only chance I'd ever have to know what my parents were like. 

I opened the second file. 

Once again, the video started with the cameraman filming towards the sofa. My mum was sitting on it and I was sitting next to her. I was a little older this time, probably about 8 or 9. Of course, they had got my resemblance down perfectly. I suspect they’d found footage of me at a pro-life rally with Mariah as a kid, and trained some sort of AI with it. 

This one was strange. Both my mother and I looked slightly uncomfortable. My mum’s face was red and shining with sweat, and there were dark circles under her eyes. I kept scratching at my scalp and chewing my lip. For a while, the cameraman filmed us as we sat in silence. 

I assumed it was my dad filming, but my dad walked into frame. He stood in front of us and stared directly at the cameraman, as if he was waiting for direction. Dad looked a bit different than he did in the first file. His cheeks were more gaunt, and he also had dark circles under his eyes. He held a note in his hand, looked down at it and took a deep breath. 

“Okay, okay” he said, his voice shaking slightly. “Okay, who’s this?”


Dad stretched his arms out and started doing a bizarre dance. He jerked up and down awkwardly, waving his hands around. With no music, you could hear each shuffle he made against the ground.

“Michael Jackson?” My mum asked. 

“No!” Dad said. He started swishing back and forth more rapidly. His eyes were so wide the whites of his eyes looked like two giant marbles. 

“Oh god” Mum said, putting her hand over her face.

“MC Hammer!” The version of me in the video called out. Dad stopped and took a deep breath of relief.

“That’s right,” he said, with an awkward forced smile. He stood there blankly as all three of us remained silent. The video ended there. 

Now, I knew about the rule of thirds. The first video was okay, the second video was slightly unnerving. I suppose the third video I was sure would be something horrible. The video I’d just seen made me feel as though there was rotten milk in my stomach. I knew this wasn’t real at all, but it did seem as though my family, the image of my family, was in trouble. Somebody was filming them, forcing them to do things. I wasn’t sure that I’d watch the third one. I didn’t know if I could take it. 

It took a few hours for me to work up the courage to press play on tape number 3. I was rocking myself back and forth as the tape began.

The last video was filmed in the kitchen. Only my mother was present. She was leaning against the counter and staring blankly into the camera. Once again, her face was red and a thin film of sweat on her skin was lit up by the camera.  She smiled nervously, both sets of teeth bared. 

“What do you want to say to Drew when he sees this?” The man behind the camera asks “After all, we’re making these for him” 

The cameraman’s voice I recognised as my fathers. His voice had a very flat affect at this point, as though he was reading off a card and was just past caring. 

“I’d like him to know” My mum said, clearing her throat “That leaving him wasn’t our choice” 

These words made her voice crack. Her eyes widened and her lips turned to a thin line. She started to rock back and forth, her fists clutching the fabric of her skirt. 

“It’s okay, it’s okay.” My dad said.

“What if nobody finds him, Harry?” 

There was a silence behind the camera “They promised he’d be safe” Dad said eventually “If we do what we’re told. We might even be able to go back, eh? We just need to cooperate” 

“What else does he want us to say?” Mum asked with a tone of resignation. 

“Drew,” My dad said behind the camera “God bless you. Wherever you are when you see this. I hope these tapes bring you some comfort. Mom and dad will come back for you someday”

Mom nodded in a kind of miserable agreement. She then held our arms out as though she was gesturing for somebody to come forward, but the video cut off. 

It was over then, I’d seen all three tapes. This was so utterly beyond sick that I considered calling the police. But instead, I watched all three again to try and pick them apart. I took screenshots of my parents from the video and overlaid them with the photos I had of them. They lined up absolutely perfectly. 

Then I dug up photos of me at the age of 5 and then at the age of 8. I overlaid them with screenshots of “me” from the video. The first boy lined up almost exactly, but the version of me in the second one did not. The boy in the second video didn't have the freckle under his nose that I have. He still looked exactly like me at that age, and lined up in every other regard but that was one detail the mimicker missed. The boy wasn’t me. 

There was never any way the boy was me as it was. My parents had abandoned me as an infant. The boy was somebody else, someone who looked just like me. These tapes were made in advance. Someone made my parents record them before they were forced to abandon me. My entire life I had staunchly denied there being any foul play, and these tapes hit me in the face with how wrong I was.

I called the police right away, expecting this to be the thing that blew the case wide open. I let the cops take my laptop just so they could look at them. I got a callback a week later from a very bored sounding copper who told me the videos were a “hoax”. He told me they determined the videos were only deepfake trickery and were not substantial to the case in any way.

“There’s some sick people out there, but no laws were broken” He said. I couldn’t believe it. What I saw was as real as it gets. I realised I was on my own, but that didn’t stop me. I still had a truckload of evidence. I didn’t need the cops.

I went through each video again with a fine toothed comb, particularly the second one. It was filmed by a fourth person, and obviously they were the one I should be looking at. I checked for any reflective surface so that I might see his face. I was stumped for a while, but then I remembered… my mum’s glasses!

I paused on her glasses and really zoomed in. I put the screenshot through several programs to enhance it. I only managed to see tiny pixels that sort of resembled a person, maybe a pale blob with a little dark dot on top that I suppose was their hair. It was the best result I could get. I had the mind to show that to the police and ask them if deepfakes ever go as far as to render a reflection in somebody’s glasses. 

The other thing I was focused on was what my dad said. “They promised he’d be safe”. I never knew who found me. I had always been told that they wanted their name to be withheld, that they were just some innocent resident who didn’t want to get mixed up in any of this. I’d long had a desire to meet them, thinking it was completely dumb luck that they walked past our apartment. I’d never questioned their story.

It now started to seem a bit strange. They somehow heard me crying through the door, when I was all the way back in one of the bedrooms? They just happened to be walking past my apartment? 

I went back to the apartment building to test how the Hell that would have worked. It was a fairly small building with three floors and only 6 apartments, 2 on each floor. The articles had always pushed that since it was so small, people looked out for each other, hence why I was discovered at all. I was still alone there for three days, so they couldn't have been looking out for me that well. I didn’t see why someone would just be walking past our apartment when the building was so small.

That was another thing that didn’t add up. Not one of the articles mentioned that the person who found me actually lived in the building. I went and put my ear against the door of every apartment. I couldn’t hear a thing from inside, not even the slightest hum of a TV or a whir of a fan. I’d seen cars parked outside so at least one of them was home. The doors were totally soundproof. There’s no way they’d have just heard me. 

Whoever found me knew I was there. That was the only explanation. I had been curious about my origins before and requested all the files on my parents' disappearances. Every reference to the person who found me was scrubbed. It said they were determined not to be relevant to the investigation. It never referred to them by name, it never even confirmed if they were a man or a woman, it never even confirmed if they lived in the building. I didn’t question it then but now I wonder.

The police might have been protecting them. My dad had referred to “them”, so I don’t think it was just the one person who made them do this. I wondered if the police were involved. That was why they brushed off the videos so readily. That was why they hid this person’s identity. That was why nothing had ever really been done. 

It was a little strange that I had been adopted by a millionaire too. My grandparents were originally going to take me in, but Mairah and her team had persuaded them. They offered them a lot of money, and showed them the amazing conditions I would live in. I wonder if they got Mariah involved just to stop my grandparents asking too many questions. I always thought she just coveted me because I was the “Miracle Baby”, but maybe there was something else in it for her. 

I called her and once again she had a confused and slightly annoyed reaction to hear from me. I knew that none of the kids lived there anymore and she’d more or less given up on children at this point. I didn’t know what she did these days.

“Mariah, why did you adopt me?” I asked her. There was a strange noise on the other end of the line, as though she was smacking her lips. “I don’t think you wanted to, right? Did somebody tell you to?”

“Of course I did,” She said, but she didn’t sound quite convincing. “You’re the Miracle Baby”

“You didn’t try to adopt Baby Jack or Lavender Jade though” Suddenly it dawned on me. I had been dragged to events with Jack and Lavender my entire childhood, and it never occurred to me how odd it was. We were all around the same age, and we’d all been abandoned as infants in the same town. Our town wasn’t very big either, and it wasn’t particularly high-crime or high poverty.

“This is childish, Drew, what are you talking aboot? I adopted you because I wanted to”

“Right…” I said quietly. I wasn’t so convinced “I wish I could come around again” 

“Well, you have a key. I’m away in the maldives right now, but you can stay at the house whenever you want”

I drove down to my childhood home almost as soon as the call was over. It’s a much more modest house than you’d expect from a millionaire, but it’s still very beautiful. When Mairah is away on holiday, a cleaner comes in to keep it in check. There were still cans of coke in the fridge and expensive mints in the glass dish on the kitchen table. I went into Mariah’s study, as I knew that was where bank statements were kept.

She kept files on all her charity work, particularly the charity made in my name; The Miracle Fund. Jack and Lavender also had funds. I never knew exactly what these charities did for anybody though, or how much money they made. Come to think of it, the only thing I’d seen her do for charity was giving Playstations to the kids at the Children’s home. You could say maybe The Miracle Fund was for my well-being, or for my college or something. But I’d never been told that. I’d always been told it was a charity, to help other children. 

The statements were filed by year, going back to about 1990. I looked at the files from the year I was abandoned, 2001, to see if there was any proof that Mariah was bribed into adopting me.

I found a form that was filed about a month after I was abandoned. It was a Charity registration form, for “The Miracle Project”. It listed it as a “Children’s Charity”, they stated their aim as to help Children who’d been orphaned to find a community. The founders of the Miracle Project were listed as Mariah, Paul Wilke, and Lucas P. Arrow. 

I searched for statements in 1999 and 2002, when Jack and Lavender were abandoned. A “Baby Boy Jack” charity was registered 3 weeks after the date he was found, by the same founders as the Miracle Project. A “Lavender Jade Fund” was registered just under 2 weeks after Lavender Jade was found. The motives were different. Jack’s charity’s aim was to “help disadvantaged mothers through pregnancy” and Lavender’s charity’s aim was to “create community outreach for troubled young girls”. 

I searched through the bank statements and found over the years there had been many donations into these accounts, but not that much money had gone out. I saw that Mariah declared on forms that they had withdrawn money from the charity accounts and given it to the local children’s homes. Allegedly, a small amount of money was put into a college fund for each child to get into when they were 18. The other ventures the charities had spent money on were apparently youth clubs and pregnancy support groups, but the budget seemed to be way over the top for that. I knew there was something fishy about it. I’d seen Mariah spend more on fancy holidays and expensive treats than anything else. 

It looked like Mariah and the two guys had only conspired to make money off of us. Nearly as soon as we were found, they found a way to milk us dry with fake charities. At best, you could say this was selfish and opportunistic, but I didn’t think it was any opportunity. 3 abandoned infants magically show up in the same town, and three rich people magically erect charities immediately after they were found. 

I went to the library the next day and looked at the old archived newspapers. I’d heard the stories of mine and my fellow infant’s abandonments a hundred times before but I’d never read the actual articles.

I looked at Lavender Jade’s story first. She had been found wrapped in blankets in a church, like the mother was seeking retribution. It’s really theatrical, so of course it became the biggest story out of the three of us. Lots of people rushed to adopt the girl. The articles said she was eventually adopted but didn’t name the parents. I had seen her mum and dad a few times at fundraisers, but I never actually knew their names. 

I found the story of Baby Boy Jack. He’d been in the trash for just a few hours, and the person who found him wasn’t named. It said, like it said for me, that they were a member of the public who asked to remain anonymous. It didn’t specify if they were a man or a woman either, their identity was totally protected. The news quickly reported on the charity in his name, and said he had quickly been adopted by “Paul and Jennie Wilke”. 

I accidentally turned to the next page and immediately saw a headline at the top right of the page that made my heart sink.

“Missing pregnant woman feared dead,

It has now been four weeks since Hannah May Dodd, 19, was last seen. She was 7 and a half months pregnant at the time of her disappearance. Her family reports that she left in her vehicle at around 7pm on the 9th of July. Dodd frequently expressed anxiety towards her pregnancy and may have suffered from suicidal ideation. Her vehicle has not been located.”

I swallowed hard. I didn’t know anybody else was missing, much less another parent. Two missing parents and two abandoned infants. How had nobody put this together? I supposed there must have been a third disappearance behind Lavender’s abandonment, but I couldn’t find a mention of another missing person before or after they found her. Maybe she was a coincidence, or maybe they’d covered it up so well that her parents were never even reported missing.

I was certain now that there was a conspiracy to it. I mean, there was no way there wasn’t. It still didn’t explain the videos I was sent. My whole life I’d never bothered to question anything about my life or my parents disappearance. I guessed maybe the videos were deepfake trickery, but why would anyone go through the effort? Did they want me to know the truth? 

I looked at the email address that sent me the videos again; larrow02172. I didn’t think to email them before, I had this stubborn idea of not giving them what they wanted. Now, I just sent them a message asking them who they were and why I sent it to them. 

They eventually wrote back; “You deserved to know the truth. You were the only one of us who knew who your parents were. You went your whole life thinking they’d walked out on you.”

“So are you saying these videos are real? These are actually my parents? This is actually what happened?”

“Only the last one is real. The first two I filmed with actors and I just deepfaked your faces on afterwards. The owners of your old apartment let me film there. It was actually my final project for my film studies course. I found the last tape in my dad’s study. He also had photos of your father robbing a jewellery store, I think he blackmailed them into abandoning you. I think he murdered them too.  Just so they could make money off you."

My head, at that point, was swimming. I didn’t know who this person was, who the dad was, or what any of it meant anymore. I texted them back to ask them who they were, and who their dad was but they went cold. They stopped replying. I did try the police again, I showed them the emails, and I pointed out the connection between Baby Boy Jack and Hannah Dodd. They didn’t take it seriously. They told me every lead had been pursued.  They told me the emails were just from a crazy person and to “just block them”. I argued with them and told them about Mariah’s charity fraud, but they just asked me to leave. They acted as though I was nothing but an attention seeker. 

A few years later, I got an email from Lavender Jade of all people. She told me her father had died and she wanted me to come to the wake “You were always by my side at those awful fundraisers, so I’d like you to be here”. 

The wake looked insanely expensive. It was in a glitzy venue with chandeliers and tuxedoed waiters ferrying around glasses of champagne. It took me a while to find the big card that honoured Lavender’s father. The sign said “A celebration of the life of the dedicated philanthropist Lucas Patrick Arrow - 4th March 1964 - 17th February 2022” Underneath those words were a list of his many achievements. 

Lavender herself approached me. She looked very elegant in a cocktail dress with her hair neatly arranged into two plaits. She took a small sip of champagne when she saw me. I clumsily hugged her, scared I’d break her glass.

“He died on my birthday” She said flippantly, not looking particularly sad. 

“You mean your abandonment day” I pointed out. She laughed shrilly, a laugh I knew well as the put-on rich person's laugh. 

“He killed himself. Everyone’s very careful not to say that tonight. He picked my birthday just to spite me, I think” 

“Why would he do that? You guys didn’t get along?” I asked meekly.

“You could say that. I never liked how he’d do anything for money, we used to fight about it. I know he did some evil things to make money. I knew he broke the law, even. But it’s strange. Ever since he died, I feel like I respect him for it” 

I left the wake with a slight feeling of unease. I’d moved out of my hometown, but there was no avoiding the news story that came about soon after. It went national.

Another infant was found abandoned in my hometown, a little girl. She had been left at the edge of a park in the early morning hours. Her recovery was miraculous and she was nicknamed Sienna Rose. Lavender Arrow adopted the infant and set up a charity in her name, The Sienna Rose Foundation.

A little more digging showed that a 25 year old pregnant woman vanished from my town five weeks before they found little Sienna Rose. It only made one article.
