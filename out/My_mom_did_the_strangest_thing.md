I'm an 18 year old male, with a typical suburban upper middle class life. I live with my parents. My mom is on a business trip, I did a Zoom call with her, my dad wasn't there. We were talking about school, it was a completely normal conversation, but then the strangest thing happened. 

&#x200B;

A naked attractive woman who looked like she was in her early 20s stood next to her, turned around, bent over, and started shitting. Then my mom touched her asshole, rubbed some shit on her forehead, and licked her finger. The woman then walked away.

&#x200B;

But here's the strangest part: My mom didn't acknowledge this in any way. Before, during and after, she just kept talking about school, like nothing happened. I didn't say anything about it, I had no idea what to say, so I just continued the conversation normally. But I was, and still am, absolutely horrified. I still haven't spoken to her or anyone else about it. I have no idea what to do, or what to think.

As far as I know, my mom is a typical 58 year old mom. She's completely straight, she's happily married to my dad, they have a completely typical and monogamous marriage, she'd never consider cheating, she has no weird fetishes, she's not into younger people, she's not open about her sex life, and she has no mental health issues. I have no idea what happened. No explanation makes any sense. I'm starting to wonder if I hallucinated it, but I was completely sober, and I have no mental health issues.
