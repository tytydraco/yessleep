Antarctica, Man’s last terrestrial frontier. An unimaginable frozen hellscape that’s stopped numerous explorers in their tracks. A desolate wasteland at the bottom of the world with no equal. A land home to only a privy amount of creatures and even they struggle against its unforgiving nature. A land that should be left to its own devices. A land that I now find myself traveling against my will as we speak.

“We will be landing in proximity in 15 minutes sir, brace yourself for landing,” The Pilot yells out over the loud hum of the engine.

Now I would like to label myself as an adventurous man who’s had his fair share of excitement throughout my lifetime. In fact, due to my work I’ve traversed many uninhabitable lands and territories that would leave most seasoned explorers hopeless, but Antarctica is the one place that should be left in peace.

Gazing out the window I see King George Island coming into view. Even this southern point island is unimaginably desolate. The fact that there's living creatures who call this continent their home truly amazes me. Even with all of my experience it will only marginally put me ahead of your typical tourist, but even then the slightest mistake could take my life at any moment.

The plane makes a rough landing as I’m pulled from my thoughts, the engine dies down, and I’m finally able to make my departure. The moment I step off of the plane I'm immediately greeted by a middle aged man.

“You must be Mr. Hensley, it’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Barnabas Oakley, although My friends call me Barny.” Barnabas chuckles to himself as he reaches out to shake my hand.

“Like the purple dinosaur?” I immediately quip while grabbing his hand. “I apologize, but yes I’m Joseph Hensley, and it's a pleasure to meet you too.”

Getting a full look at the man he stands roughly 6 '4 about two inches taller than myself, and with the grip he’s using along with the environment he lives in, I assume he has quite a robust physique. Although, it would be hard to tell with all of the clothing he has. His aging gray hair suits him naturally giving off a dashing appearance of a seasoned guide.

“That’s quite alright Joey, that’s exactly where the nickname came from an old college story I’d love to share with you sometime.” Barnabas hearty laughs. “I’ll be the guide for this little adventure of ours so here’s to our future cooperation.”

I was slightly annoyed at the fact he gave me a nickname, but his boisterous attitude and free thinking was slightly amusing and I decided to play along with it. Grabbing my gear I proceed to follow my new found friend into what appears to be our dwelling.

“Where are the others or am I the first to arrive?” I ask while setting my gear down on the nearest piece of furniture.

“The lovely Professor and his assistant are currently doing research.” Barnabas emphasizes lovely while rolling his eyes. “As for our generous provider for this adventure he will be coming in later this afternoon. Till then we don’t have much else to do besides kick back and wait for his arrival.”

Taking a look around the building it’s simple in design with a worn down couch, a small kitchen, a fireplace, and other odd ends of furniture placed around. With two hallways splitting off in each direction which I assume lead to our individual quarters.

“The room at the end of the hallway on the left will be your room for tonight Joey.” Barny motions with his finger in that direction. “I’ve heard through the grapevine that you’ve worked with the Professor before?”

“On a few occasions our paths have crossed before, it seems we share similar interests from time to time. In fact he’s the one who asked…” Before I can finish my statement the door swings open as a giant of man steps through the door.

Barnabas can be considered quite big himself, but this man easily dwarfs him by over half a foot. In fact he’s barely able to make it through the door frame.  As we stare in disbelief for a few seconds we notice the man standing behind him. Stepping through the entrance the newcomer briefly scans the room before finding a seat across from Barnabas and I with the giant swiftly following behind them.

“I thought frost giants went extinct ages ago.” Barnabas leans over and whispers to me.

Unable to contain my laughter I let out a slight chuckle which seemed to have caught the attention of our guest. The giant remained stationary behind the other man, but the newcomer proceeded to remove their gear and clothing revealing their face.

“Hello gentlemen, I’ve been instructed that this resident will serve us for the night before our expedition tomorrow.” A soothing voice comes from the mysterious newcomer.

Turning our attention back to them we see that the smaller of the two is in fact a woman. She appears to be in her mid thirties with aubrey hair hanging down to her waist and pale skin. To an extent that it almost looked unhealthy, in fact the longer I looked at her the more I got the feeling there was something wrong with her.

Although she presented herself in a professional manner, her sunken eyes and poor complexion did not fit someone who was about to travel to the most treacherous place on Earth. Considering everyone else on this trip can be accounted for I can only assume this is the mysterious benefactor Barnabas mentioned earlier.

“Pardon for the late introductions, but I’m Lauren Suncrest. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.” Lauren smiles while saying. “This lovely man behind me is Yorick and while he may not speak much he’s great company to have around.”

At those words Barnabas and I both look at each other and back at Yorick coming to the same conclusion, ‘Who’s ever going to believe that.’

“It’s also a pleasure to meet you too Ms. Suncrest. I’m Barnabas Oakley and to my left here is Joseph Hensley. My friends call me Barny though.” Barnabas makes the same introduction.

“Thank you Mr. Oakley, although I prefer to stick to formal greetings.” Lauren immediately shuts down Baranbas’s suggestion. “Mr. Hensley I’ve heard much about you from the Professor, He’s stated that your skills are highly valued.”

“Well I’m not sure how much use they will be here. I think Barnabas over here will be of much more use than me hopefully.” I attempt to deflect the comment. “I heard that you weren’t coming until this afternoon though?”

“I could hardly wait till then and when I heard everyone else would be arriving earlier it would only be fair that I show up in kind. It’s quite rare that I get out much.” Lauren laments to herself.

“Well I would say that we're quite thankful for your generous funding for this expedition. I have to also say for someone your age to be this successful is quite surprising. “ Barnabas says cheerfully. “What is it that you do Ms. Suncrest?”

Barnabas seems perfectly able to use Lauren’s last name, but proceed to give me a nickname. I’ll have to discuss that with him later. I was just as curious as Barnabas though. From what I could gather hundreds of millions of dollars were thrown into this expedition and while I may not know every billionaire out there, I feel a woman of her age should at least be in the public eye.

“There’s no need to worry about such things Mr. Oakley and I prefer to leave my business out of it. There's no need for that here anyways. I’d rather get to know my team better.” Lauren roughly coughs for a few seconds before continuing. “When can I expect to meet the Professor?”

“I’m not exactly sure as the Professor seems to be taking recordings around the island as for when he will be back I can’t exactly answer that.” Barnabas states.

Shortly after saying that though the door is once again forced open as a balding young man steps through the door with a young woman following behind him. After many years of working on and off with the Professor I knew it could only be him. There’s only one word I could use to describe him and that is arrogance. At a mere 25 years old this young man could have revolutionized any field of study simply by putting in a little effort.

He could make Einstein himself look like a child compared to his vast intelligence and I have no doubt that if he wanted to he could lead the world. The only unfortunate thing is he knows that he can, which only fuels his own ego. Maybe fortunately or unfortunately he likes to keep to himself and his research which is to say is outside the realm of accepted fact. Leading him to be shunned or rejected from the majority of the scientific community, but maybe only a man as crazy and intelligent as him can make the impossible possible though.

As for the woman trailing behind him it is my first time meeting her. Of all my years of knowing the Professor he’s never worked with anyone closely before and the mere mention of an assistant would send him into an outrage. Anyone else is too lacking to work for him so either this woman is smart enough to where even he acknowledges her abilities or she has some other use for her. For her sake I pray it's the former as anyone that is of use to the Professor hardly has a good end.

Taking a brief glance at all of us the Professor slightly pauses in my direction before speaking, “Ms. Suncrest I see you’ve made it here in good health. I would like to thank you for funding this research of mine.”

Healthy is the last word I would use for her, but perhaps her condition has previously improved. Even with the Professor's attitude he at least wouldn't sour the relationship between himself and the one that’s allowing him to roam freely.

“Thank you Professor, it's thanks to your help that I’ve even been able to make it this far. Before I met you all my other doctors gave up hope for my condition.”

“No need, it was a simple transaction. I will be retiring to my room for the rest of the night so don't disturb me.” The professor curtly responds. “Feel free to mingle with them, Victoria.”

Without another word the Professor heads to his room. All of us simultaneously turned our attention to Victoria. Beside the fact she’s been traveling with the Professor there’s nothing else remarkable about her, and in fact she seems quite forgettable. Barnabas is the first one as always to make his presence known.

“Lovely to meet you Victoria, the name is Barnabas, but my friends call me Barny. The scary looking man over there is Yorick while the woman in front of him is our generous benefactor Ms. Suncrest. As for the last gentleman on the couch, that's Joseph, but I'm not quite sure what he does.” Baranabs thinks aloud.

“Ni..Nice to meet you too Barny.” A meek voice pops out. “I’m Victoria Ainsfield and I hope you’ll be able to take care of me.”

“Well aren’t you a shy one!” Barnabas’ voice is clearly joyful. “ How can a wonderful girl like you ever be involved with the Professor?”

Barnabas seemed to have taken an immediate liking to this girl after all she is the only one who decided to call him by that ridiculous nickname of his. Although she seems to have some form of social anxiety and clear discomfort from his clear lack of social boundaries. Her attitude unfortunately only leads me to further believe that her use here is less than humane. Hopefully this poor girl can make it. I can’t even guarantee my own survival.

“Alright Baranbas give the poor girl a break, she has only met us for five minutes and you’re already hammering her with hard questions.” I intervene on her behalf. “Go ahead and take a seat over here Victoria, but in the interest of getting to know everyone I would like to ask what is everyone's connection with the Professor?”

“My involvement with him is quite simple, and you may already have an idea after our initial exchange with one another.” Lauren speaks first. “While I’ve had quite a successful career I’ve unfortunately been plagued with a rare genetic disorder since an early age. The fact that I've been able to survive this long has been thanks to my vast wealth and resources, finding every type of treatment imaginable to help me. Eventually all of my options ran out until the Professor came along and proposed a new type of treatment which has vastly improved my condition. Although it is only temporary, and I’m not completely cured.’ Lauren’s voice fades with the last part.

“What about you Barnabas, Why were you chosen from everyone else?” I ask

“That’s quite simple Joey, I’m the only one crazy enough to go on this little escapade of ours. Not to mention the generous compensation to my family regardless of success or failure was a nice incentive.” Barnabas states.

Why would a man with a family be willing to risk his life for this? I can understand the financial motivation as I’m well aware of what I'm being paid, but there's almost no chance he will make it back alive.

“H… He saved me.” Victoria’s voice cutting in. “I was living on the streets alone before this and the Professor gave me a home. He said I was special and I’ve been helping him with his research for over a year now.”

She’s been helping that arrogant bastard!? Now I have to say this has come as a great surprise, maybe things have gotten a little more interesting that I initially assumed.

“Since you’ve been so close to the Professor, can you give us a clue for what exactly we’re doing out here during the absolute worst time of the year exploring Antarctica?” Barnabas interrupts.

“No!” Victoria yells. “Ex…Excuse me, only the Professor can reveal what we’re doing here.”

Everyone beside Yorick noticeably jumps at her sudden shift of attitude when it comes to the Professor's work. It seems we will be kept in the dark for a while longer then. It seems the Professor has quite a hold on her.

“And you Joey? What is your involvement in all of this?” Barnabas shifts the conversation.

“I too would like to know Mr. Hensley, the Professor, highly recommended that you be here on this trip. What exactly is your relationship with the Professor?” Lauren also asks.

“My relationship with him is slightly more complicated than the rest of yours. I’ve had dealings with him the past couple of years. In fact you could say I was one of the few people to see him take off in his career.” I pause while gauging their reaction. “As for why I’ve been asked here, I owe him a favor for saving my life a few years ago, and it’s not until now that he’s called upon it.”

“That still doesn’t explain what it is that you do Mr. Hensely, from what I’ve gathered on the Professor's background his research is not what you would call exactly normal.” Lauren presses.

“What do you mean by that Ms. Suncrest?” Barnabas interrupts.

“Are you unaware?” Lauren asks, surprised. “I suppose that’s natural considering his work. In a crude sense you could call him a paranormal researcher. In a more sophisticated manner he proves the impossible through scientific fact. Everything that he contributes though is either for his own gain or kept from public view as it’s deemed too important for public view.”

“He’s kind of like a ghost hunter then?” Barnabas asks.

“No, not even close, but I'm sure he might be able to prove their existence.” Lauren chuckles. “He has a special interest in myths and legends. As for what he’s proven was outside even my own influence as the majority of his discoveries seem to be kept to himself. That brings us back to the question though. What is it that you do Mr. Hensley?” Lauren demands while staring at me.

“If the Professor didn’t tell you of my involvement then that means I might not be needed, simply treat me as another aid of sorts.”

Clearly dissatisfied with my answer, but knowing I won’t speak further on the subject they decide to leave me alone for now. What I didn’t tell them though is that if I am needed then death is the least of their worries. I’m scared of what’s out there and I’m terrified of why the Professor needs me. Out of all these years why did he choose to ask for my help now.

“Miss it’s about time that you rest, there’s a long journey ahead of us.” A smooth baritone voice speaks out from the group.

“I suppose you’re right Yorick, I've had enough fun for the day. Ladies and gentlemen it was a pleasure meeting you, but I believe I’ll be retiring for the day.” Lauren stands with the aide of Yorick.

“Don’t forget Ms. Suncrest that we will have a debriefing on our expedition tomorrow morning make sure you’re there.” Barnabas states in an unusually strict tone.

“Of course Mr. Oakley I haven’t forgotten, if that is all then.” Lauren trails off as she and Yorick move to their rooms.

“I’ll also be going back to the Professor.” Victoria quips before running off.

“I have to say that girl is seriously attached to him, In fact I almost forgot she was here though.” Baranabas shyly states.

“Me too, what a strange girl.” I mumble to myself. “Now that everyone has left I want you to answer me honestly here Barnabas. What do you think are the odds of us reaching our destination?”

Barnabas turns his attention towards me and silently stares for a few seconds before sighing, “Honestly, I don’t think we will at all and I feel obligated to dissuade you from this trip Joseph.”

“What do you mean?” I ask.

“Ms. Suncrest is due to die at any moment it seems, Victoria is  attached to the Professor, and the Professor, well in my eyes he’s nothing but a raving lunatic.” Barnabas rambles. “ There’s nothing out there, and there will be nothing to find. I don’t care how many PHD’s that man has, he's throwing his life away.”

“Why are you going then? Money can’t be your only motivation?” I press.

“Just like Ms. Suncrest I’m also dying, Joey, while I have longer to live than her, but it’s only a matter of time. The symptoms won’t start showing up till about a few months but once they do it’s nothing, but pain.” Barnabas dejectedly states. “I don’t want to die like that, and at least this way I know my family can be taken care of after I’m gone. With future medical bills and treatments it would ruin us.”

“I'm sorry Barnabas I had no Idea.”

“Don’t you worry about it Joey, this old man is still spry.” Barnabas chuckles. “You should worry about yourself. I know you said you owed the Professor, but I’m telling you no debt is too great for throwing your life away for.” Barnabas states again.

“That’s the thing Barnabas, this debt is that great and I owe it to this man. Thank you for your concern though and like the others I believe I’ll call it a day.” I say while standing.

Barnabas watches as I head to my room. I know that before we leave that he will try to convince me again, but I’ve already made my choice in the matter. With the new found information though the Professor's intentions became even more shrouded in mystery.

What Barnabas doesn’t know is that while he may be a lunatic he is much too arrogant to throw his life away. There is something that he knows that the rest of us don’t, but my greatest concern is that he will be willing to use our lives to prove it. Everyone here is either dying or forced here under some obligation of duty or responsibility and I’m sure he will take full advantage of that fact.

Regardless though there’s nothing I can do, and I sure as hell can’t outthink him. The only thing I can do at this point is pray I’m wrong and the worst thing we come across is the severe weather conditions.

Plopping myself on the bed, the weariness of traveling and incessant worrying is finally catching up as I fall asleep and let my body rest.

"We'll meet again soon, child.’ A booming voice sounds in my head

Startled awake I leaped out my bed scanning my room trying to find the source of that voice. After a few brief seconds of confusion I realize I must have been dreaming. Gathering my bearing I check the time and see that it’s close to our appointed debriefing with Barnabas.

Making my way to the common area I see the only other individual is Barnabas putting together a map and some other materials for his display. Taking a seat I cough slightly to make my presence known.

“Ah Joey, how great that you could join us, pardon the mess.” Barnabas says while fidgeting with the map.

“Is everyone else still in their rooms?” I ask.

“It appears that way, but I think they should be trickling in here within the next 15 minutes.” Barnabas states while returning to his work.

Wasting no time, I decide to have some food before everyone else arrives. With our current conditions nothing we eat will be great, but it’ll have to do for the time being. The next group to arrive is Lauren and her bodyguard trailing closely behind her. Her condition seems to have approved slightly as her complexion isn’t as pale as before.

“Good Morning Gentleman, I hope that there is some coffee around this shack of ours?” Lauren asks

“Good Morning Ms. Suncrest, you’ll find a fresh pot already brewed for you.” Barnabas replies.

While Lauren gets her daily dose of coffee I take a seat on the couch across from Barnabas and patiently wait for the Professor's arrival. Not 2 minutes before the appointed time the Professor strolls through and takes a seat to the left of me while Victoria finds herself right next to him.

“Now then, since everyone is here, let's begin our brief crash course on what to expect and safety measures.” Barnabas voice rings out through the shack. “ If you’re not already aware, during the winter months the sun does not rise here in Antarctica, and will not for the next few months. Making Visibility at an all time low, not to mention the mental strain a lack of sunlight can have on the human body.”

Glancing around it seems that everyone was already aware of this fact. While perpetual night might adversely affect our moods and sleeping habits I feel it will be the least of our worries when it comes to this expedition.

“Because of the increased ice mass due to mass freezing, our entry point into the continent will be farther than expected. The initial journey to the direct South Pole should have been roughly 500 miles, but has been subsequently increased to roughly 800 miles. The journey should take us around 3 months if conditions prove favorable and possibly much longer if not.”

“We’ve already been briefed on this Mr. Oakley, please continue with the risk.” Lauren says.

“I’m simply getting all the facts together Ms. Suncrest. Now then there are roughly 3 obstacles in our expedition. Provisions, weather, and crevasses. I’m sure you’re aware that nothing lives on this continent. There are no terrestrial animals to speak of. As you can imagine there is no water to speak of, this place is considered a desert. What we bring with us is what we will have. The moment we run out of supplies is the moment we die.” Barnabas emphasizes the last part.

“Can we not melt the ice that’s already there?” Yorick speaks out.

“Unfortunately no and even if we could, the amount of resources that we would have to devote to such a task would outweigh what we would get out of it.” Barnabas patiently answers. “Weather, there is like no other place on Earth. Temperatures dropping to below 120 degrees fahrenheit, wind speeds clocking up to 200 miles per hour. Blizzards and storms that can completely destroy your base camp in seconds if not properly prepared for. Your skin will freeze and die, while your body's functions will immediately cease to work. No part of your body should ever be exposed to outside conditions.”

“You’ll find the clothes I have provided for this expedition will be able to handle such conditions provided you don’t remove them.” The Professor chimes in.

“I’ve tested them myself and I have to say there's nothing else like them.” Barnabas adds. “Even if you’re able to survive the temperatures the wind speeds will rip you to shreds if given the chance.”

“Last, but not least crevasses. These are listed across the entire continent and one wrong step will have you falling to your death. Even if you somehow survive the fall there is no rescue and there is no help. Your only option is to either freeze to death or starve whatever comes first.” Barnabas grimly puts it. “ We will be using radar to search for these as we move along, but there are no promises we will be able to spot them all. Take every step as if it's your last because it very well might be.”

“How are we going to carry 3 months worth of supplies with us?” Lauren asks.

“We will be driving 3 separate tractors carrying all of our supplies with us. Each group of two will be responsible for these tractors as it is vital for our survival. If any of these tractors are to fail or become inoperable the expedition will be considered a failure.” Barnabas says while showing us a picture of one such tractor.

“Are there any other questions?” Barnabas asks

“Yes, What exactly do we plan to find when we reach our destination?” I ask the crowd.

A brief moment of silence followers my questions as everyone beside the Professor seems to also want to know. Turning our attention towards him he sits there staring right back at me, his gaze seems to convey that I already know why we are here.

“I make no guarantees on what we will find there, but as promised your problems will be solved and your alignments will be cured.” The Professor simply adds before returning to silence.

“Well I don’t have much longer to live, I’m not sure about the rest of you but I'm willing to take that chance.” Lauren speaks up.

“I’ve also wanted to add my name to the list of great explorers of our time so you can count me in.” Barnabas agrees.

Victoria and Yorick seemed to have already silently agreed as their motives seem to be for the success of their respective patron. Everyone else turns their attention towards me waiting for an answer. I intended to immediately agree with the rest, but suddenly a deep seeded fear seemed to grip me. My body began to scream as it wanted to say no, resist, leave and never return. Run as far as my body can take me. There was something else lurking out there and it was not kind.

Noticing my dilemma the Professor says, “Remember your promise Joseph, this is not an expedition you can say no to.”

Finally able to regain control of my body I say, “Yes, I’m prepared for this.”

A hint of disappointment and sadness can be seen from Barnabas’s eyes as I agree. Already knowing his intentions and thoughts on this journey I feel bad for refusing the kind man’s intentions, but as the Professor mentioned this is not something I can back away from.

“Now that everyone has agreed to this mission we will be boarding our ship shortly, there is no guarantee they will be able to return to us for pickup, but they will be stationed here in case of an absolute emergency.” Barnaba’s states. “Everyone be ready within 6 hours as we will set sail for potentially our last moments alive.”

Immediately after Baranabs’s finishes the Professor and Victoria leave to their respective rooms while Lauren and Yorick stay behind to chat with me.

“What exactly did the Professor mean when he said you couldn’t refuse this Mr. Hensley.” Asked Lauren.

She had such an inquisitive nature about her. Maybe that’s why she got to where she is now. The more I speak with her the more answers I may give away, but I know that sometimes knowledge isn’t always a blessing when it comes to these matters.

“It’s a promise I made to the Professor after our first meeting 5 years ago, as for the specifics of that promise and what he did beside saving my life shall be left between the Professor and I.” I simply state.

“How curious, Now I can’t tell if you’re an honorable man Mr. Hensley or simply foolish. I’ll admit that promises are important, but throwing your life away seems pointless. Take it from a dying woman, cherish the life that you have.” Lauren chastises me.

“What about your bodyguard Yorick? He seems perfectly healthy to me, why is he here?” I snap back.

“No need for hostility, and for Yorick. Let's say he’s been looking after me since I was child and I would have to kill him before he let me go on this adventure alone. He’s the only person on this planet that I trust.” Lauren confidently states.

“It seems that you also don’t trust the Professor?”

“Who would in these circumstances?” Lauren sarcastically says. “ I may be desperate Mr. Hensley, but I'm not an idiot to believe that there’s some miracle in that barren wasteland.”

“Then why bother coming at all? Why not live out the rest of your days in peace?” I asked her, confused.

“Because I’m ambitious Mr. Hensley. There’s still so much I have to do in this world and I won’t be able to do any of that if I’m dead now could I?” Lauren chuckles. “Even if it's a 1 in a billion odds I will take that bet any day because any other decision leads to my demise. The real question is, is any human willing to die when there's a chance of life?”

Giving thought to her question it may be less of living in her case, but instead greed. Is her reason for living simply for the gift of life or for a way to continue her ambition and drive to change the world. Is either answer inherently wrong though, to fight for life regardless of reason is the basis for all living beings and even if she is fully aware that she’s being used it still gives her the opportunity to change her life.

“I don’t believe I can argue with that, human ambition is truly endless. In light of your honesty I will give you one piece of advice though.” I replied.

“And what is that Mr. Hensley?” Lauren asks.

“Death is not the worst thing to happen to us here. With the Professor he will use every drop of your blood before he discards you. Don’t take his indifference as coldness, but instead as pure malice. To him we are nothing, but expendable goods and while you may be playing this game with him you will lose I assure you. Pray that his plans don’t involve us. The only way to win is to stay out of his way.” I said before heading to my room to prepare for the trip.

I don’t know what he expects to find and I don’t know what use everyone here has. All I know is whatever grand scheme he has can only end in suffering for the rest of us. While thinking about my first encounter with him 5 years ago my body begins to shake as the memory of those events flood my mind.  I’ve attempted to lock them away for the rest of my life, but they always seem to return.

Getting a hold of myself I pack my gear and silently meditate in my room as the seconds tick by. Each one that passes is the sound of a bell ringing for my execution. Compelled by my own reasons as I walk the steps to the gallows.

“Joey! It’s time to embark, be ready in 5 minutes.” Barnabas’ voice rings from outside my door.

“I’ll be right there.” I curtly respond.

Grabbing my gear I head to the common space where I already find everyone else waiting. Barnabas with his typical cheery attitude and the Professor absorbed in his own thoughts with Victoria shyly standing behind him. Last, but not least Lauren standing tall with Yorick right in tow. Lauren glances in my direction, perhaps disturbed from my earlier statement, but I have no time or desire to explain the situation before we’re carted off.

Setting sail, I have no Idea how they’re able to navigate these waters with floating ice and zero visibility, but I’m amazed with their ability. For the majority of the boat ride everyone kept to their respective sides with Barnabas and I forming an unlikely duo as were the de facto pair for one of the tractors. I was slightly fearful of the boat sinking, but it’s a feeling I would have to slowly adapt to as every step of this journey will be fraught with danger.

Making land the first shock was the complete feeling of isolation from the rest of the world. The wind howled and the cold seemed to seep into your bones. There were no other humans on this frozen wasteland.

If you never had the pleasure of experiencing a true cold then It’s something I wish you never do. It swallows and consumes every feeling in your body, it seeps into your soul as the ability to think or function is highly limited as your body struggles to even survive. Even with the provided benefit of the Professor's clothing, it's still a near impossible struggle. Our communication is severely limited and all interactions are quick and brief.

Watching the boat slip further and further away as the last remaining contact with the outside world is out of reach. We don’t have time to lose as every second we spend idling around is another second our body gets to freezing to death.

Our expedition sets off without any real issues as we make our way through towards an unknown destination. The fear of not knowing, of not being able to see an end as the only motivation we have beside the Professor is to simply survive. At a certain point even that will slowly fade away if we’re out here long enough.

For the first two months of our trip it was mostly uneventful. After about a week of the same routine we got used to constant darkness and a sense of isolation. The only thing our bodies could never adapt to was the freezing temperatures. Regardless of how long we spent in it, it always seemed able to get colder.

Thankfully with our radar we were able to avoid many cravesses that would have certainly spelled our demise, but knowing seems to have only diminished the mood as all it takes is one that we can’t find. It wasn’t until the first week into our third month that things began to change for the worse

While setting up camp for the night we begin to discuss our daily trek and other random topics as it helps keep us sane.

“I don’t mean to alarm anyone, but has someone been taking extra rations from our supplies?” Barnabas asks while hinting at Yorick playfully.

“I would never do such a thing.” Yorick booms out.

The relationship between Barnabas, Laurn, Yorick and I has vastly improved these past two months as forced isolation and survival tends to do. Oddly enough the Professor and Victoria still seem separate from the rest of us as they even have their own tent. Although I somewhat expected these events, even throughout this entire journey I did not see one ounce of suffering on the Professor's face as if he’s walking through his backyard.

“Now Barnabas I’m sure you’ve simply miscounted, where the only ones here.” Lauren speaks up.

Barnabas' mood quickly shifts as he turns to me for an answer, but I simply shrug in response because I wasn’t the one who did it either.

We suddenly are overcome with the realization that something is wrong. The only explanation is that one of us is lying, which is unlikely as we’re basically on top of each other. The Professor or Victoria took them which is even less likely for me as he would disdain such actions or something else. I hope that Barnabas simply miscounted.

“I’ll recount in the morning, but so far it’s a week's worth of supplies which can be rationed off, but for now I suggest we be careful.” Barnabas says cautiously.

You can tell he doesn’t want to blame anyone else, but there doesn’t seem to be any other explanation besides the fact some of it got blown away which also seems illogical due to how secure we made it.

With the mood ruined we all decide to retire for the night and hope we awake with better news tomorrow.

‘You're getting closer, child, We shall meet again soon.’ The same voice rings inside my head.

“Wake up Joey!” I’m bolted awake as Barnabas shakes me.

“What, what is it?” I ask groggy while trying to understand what’s going on.

“We have a big problem, come outside and take a look.” Barnabas says cryptically before going outside.

Taking the time to put on all my gear I finally make my way outside where I can spot everyone else huddled around one of our supply boxes discussing amongst themselves.

“Did you guys figure out what’s wro…” before I can finish my sentence I’m shocked by what they’re all staring at. A ginormous footprint easily triple in size than any humans, but oddly webbed shaped in nature.

My body shakes uncontrollably again as my body freezes in its tracks. I hoped that this wouldn’t happen, I hoped that this wasn’t real, but my every fear is coming to life. I hoped that the worst we would have to deal with was the cold.

“What do you make of this Joey? The Professor said to wait for you before anything happened. What’s going on Professor?” Barnabas fearfully asked the both of us.

Everyone else beside the Professor seems disturbed by this new discovery and I can already tell panic is starting to set in, but unfortunately it only gets worse from here.

“Tell them Joseph.” The Professor commands.

I’m barely able to get the words out as I say, “I… it means we’re being hunted.”
