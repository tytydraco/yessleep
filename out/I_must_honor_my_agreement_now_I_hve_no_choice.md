It is time, time to follow him to his lair, my time is up and I have to honor my agreement with this thing. How stupid I was, but how should I have known? Nobody believes in ghosts or spirits, some do of course but I mean, such people are seldom taken seriously.

It is so unreal, is this really happening? The thing in my room certainly makes it real enough, it even talks to me, but now I amunable to understand the words, they almost hurt my ears.

What happened? For the past ten years, he had been so kind to me, fulfilling everything I had asked for. I even thought of him as a friend, strange I know, but he was always there for me, guiding me toward my deepest desires, making sure they happened just like I wanted them to.

I have never been more afraid than I am now, I can actually feel the dread occupying my body, I’m certain, I know what will happen to me, I know what he will do to me once we arrive, there is no escaping it now. It knows what I’m thinking, I should be careful.

It was just a game they said, a harmless ritual that had been performed a hundred times, did they know it would work? Properly not, and if they did, I don’t think they ever expected that thing in particular to be the one to answer, one of the worst I’m told, a real tormentor, he has only ever presented himself for a select few over the thousands of years he has existed, or so I am told. It does make me feel kind of special I guess.

The things I have seen throughout the last ten years, should I even describe them? Maybe some of the less morbid things I guess. The riches he has gifted me with, the first million was a real treat, I used it so fast I could hardly believe it, but  of course he just conjured up more somehow, I even won the lottery a few times, I guess it was all his doing.

My childhood bully found himself in the hospital a few times, with broken legs and arms, they would seemingly break out of nowhere, amazing stuff. It even made the news one time, when it was recorded by some bystanders. He should have died when he set himself on fire but he wasn't allowed to die, my friend made sure of that. I think he still lingers in the hospital, I don’t pity him.

I’m still sitting on my bed, petrified to move, I had no idea I could be this afraid, I have even pissed my pants, can I make him change his mind? No, there is simply no chance, he wants me, my soul, or at least some part of it.

Do I deserve this? I sure took advantage of the situation, but who wouldn't? Nobody got hurt, I mean, nobody that didn't deserve it. All of the criminals, rapists and murderers that have been agonized in wicked ways, they surely deserved it! Even that guy who scratched his own eyes out while screaming for help, I will never forget that guy, I almost puked, but I think a part of me actuallyI enjoyed it.

I can feel it, he is becoming irritated with me, something I don’t want to happen. I’m walking slowly now, towards him, his words are like piercing gunshots to my ears, I can’t stand them. My pants are cold and wet, they reek of urine, but I dare not stop.

Will anyone miss me? Do I just disappear or is he leaving my body behind? He is getting annoyed by all of my thoughts, but I can’t help it. My parents? Will they get sick again when I’m gone? What about all the children who have been miraculously cured from their cancer? He assures me everything will be fine, but should I believe him?

It is time, I must leave or face his cruelty, something I must avoid at all costs. I have no regrets, but I did feel the need to leave something behind, a little warning I guess. At Least just for my parents, they need to know, know I have no regrets, I would do it all again. He tell me I will be safe.

I must undress, take his hand and follow him, it is time, I have never seen him up close before, he knows what I’m thinking, he wants me to put away my phone and undress, his eyes, they are so vile, just like his hooves.

I must post this before I take your hand master, one moment I beg of you, he controls my body, some of it anyway. It is time, no more delays.
