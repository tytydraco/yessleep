I went back inside my own house and put Matilda on the table in the dining room and started towards my bedroom. I heard the voice in the back of my head, it sounded distant. Then I heard a soft voice that seemed sad and a little embarrassed, it asked, 



“Did I do something wrong? You looked concerned, are you afraid of me?” I was shocked but also not surprised by the question. I remembered I had sworn to be honest so I had to tell her, 



“Yes, I am a little afraid right now. I’m sorry, I just was not expecting all the things you can apparently do. I just need a moment.” There was a pause and then an acknowledgement, 



“Oh, alright. Well sleep well friend. I will speak with you tomorrow.” The voice faded away and is seemed she had returned to a dormant state. She sat silently on the table I had set her on and after a minute of waiting I heard no more attempts at communication.  



I walked back to my room and shut the door and sat on my bed trying to process the insanity of the day. I could not believe the situation I had found myself in, but I knew one thing, I could not give her away right now. I had no idea how she might react if I tried to give her to my mom. Worse I did not know if it would even be safe to do so. 



When I was finally able to quiet my mind, I eventually fell asleep. I remember having vivid dreams of being small and sitting on a giant shelf with giant people walking around. I could hear them speak, but I could also hear them think. The din of voices increased and threatened to drive me mad, before I finally managed to shut them out by some force of will. I thought as well, about her.... I did not know who she was but a word kept cropping up in my jumbled thoughts as I tossed and turned......Ruby. Who was Ruby? 



I woke up to my alarm blaring. I was exhausted and felt like I had hardly gotten any rest. I shot upright as I realized I had to try and find a replacement gift for my mom today. I was not going to give her Matilda, but that meant I had to find something else before I met her in the morning for breakfast. 



I got ready and raced to the door. I did not even know what would be open this early but I had to find something thoughtful in less than an hour. As I was leaving, I felt something tugging at my mind and I realized Matilda was trying to get my attention. Apparently, she wanted to go, even though I was not giving her as a gift. I told her, 



“I don’t think it is a good idea, I am going to see my mom and she might get freaked out by your.... abilities.” There was a considerate pause and her voice gently prodded into my mind, 



“I promise I won’t speak to her. You can even keep me in a backpack or something if you are embarrassed. I just don’t want to be left alone on a shelf anymore. I would like to go to where my friends go and be ready to help if they need help.” I felt bad for her and relented, under the condition that she stay in the backpack. 



I left and went back downtown to the small run of thrift shops, to try and find a last-minute replacement gift. I was lucky and found success on the first store I had tried. I managed to find a pretty music box from a store I had not visited yesterday. Things were looking up and I rushed back to my car to head to my mom's house. I was stuck at a crosswalk waiting to get to the other side where I had parked. The light changed to walk and I hurried across and heard a blaring car horn and the squeal of brakes as a bright red sports car stopped just inches before hitting me. The driver was yelling at me and had been trying to turn, despite the crosswalk signaling that pedestrians were clear to walk. I thought I heard angry ranting of, 



“Hurry up and cross you piece of shit.” I was confused by the upfront hostility of the man and angrily responded by showing him a particular finger and shouting back, 



“Learn how to read asshole, it says walk.” To my surprise he actually gunned the car and drove past me instead of waiting for me to finish crossing and actually clipped me as he sped off. I was speechless at the overt hostility and brushed myself off and hurried back to my own vehicle, shaken by the experience. 



I sat back down in my car and tried to lower my speeding heart rate. A small voice crept into the back of my mind again, 



“Are you alright?”  



I felt better for the first time hearing the reassuring voice. The weirdness of talking to the doll was wearing off and I replied to Matilda, 



“I am okay, that was just a little too close.” I did not open my backpack to look, but I could imagine her face wore a concerned expression and she replied, 



“I am sorry that happened. Some people are just terrible. They only care about themselves. The world would be better off without those sorts of people.” I felt better at her attempt to sympathize with me and I made the mistake of answering her just then, 



“Yeah, you're right. We would all be better off without reckless jerks like that in the world.” 



I started my car and drove off, not even noticing that the presence around the doll was absent for a while afterwards and never realizing that Matilda was up to something. 



 



I arrived at my mom's house and she greeted me warmly and we went inside. I wished her a happy birthday and gave her the music box I had purchased as a replacement for Matilda. She seemed to really like it and I could tell I lucked out with the last-minute find. As we spoke, I asked her how she was doing and she responded with the normal, 



“Oh me? Don’t worry about me I am doing just fine.” I asked if she was having anyone else over today and she hesitated briefly and then said, 



“No, it is just you today, having a low-key birthday this year, don't worry about me sweetie.” I did not think anything of the answer at first. Then a familiar voice gently pushed into my mind, 



“You mother is lying. She is afraid to tell you that she is still seeing someone named Michael.” At first, I tried to push Matilda’s voice away, I did not want her reading my mom’s thoughts. Then I tensed up when I heard the name Michael. I couldn't believe she was still seeing him.  



Michael was the first person my mother dated after she separated with my dad. He was an airline pilot when they met, retired now. But in reality, his full time job was a cheating scum bag. He was one of those good old boys who thought they could have a different woman in every major city, due to the nature of the job. Worse still, despite having a decent job, he was awful with money and my mom blew a ton of her own savings on him when they were together. My heart sank when I considered they might be together again. Despite her infatuation, the man was probably trying to sink his hooks into her again because he was blowing his retirement as bad as he was blowing his money when he was working. 



I knew that a heartbreak was in the near future if this was really happening. Yet, I had no idea how to broker the subject considering that I learned all this from the psychic doll in my backpack. 



My mom noticed the silence after she spoke and she was getting self-conscious about it, maybe even suspecting I somehow knew what she was saying was a lie. She promptly offered me a cup of tea and stood up and walked out of the living room we were sitting in. 



I was not sure what to do but then I realized I also had not responded to Matilda and she spoke into my mind again, 



“She should not lie to my friend. She acts self-righteous, but she does as much lying as he did, as both of them did. She feels like she can't judge because she cheated on him, on your father.” My jaw almost hit the floor and I was stunned by another, even more significant revelation about my mom and I was feeling increasingly uncomfortable. I knew that my parents had broken up, but I did not know my mom had cheated on my dad with someone else. I honestly did now want to know that. I reached out with my mind and spoke to Matilda again, 



“Please do not read my mom’s mind, I know you want to help but it is making me uncomfortable.” There was a moment of silence and then a soft respond of, 



“I am sorry it is making you sad my friend, I only want to help. If your mother’s lies are making you uncomfortable, I can take care of her......That way she will not be able to lie to you anymore.” My blood turned to ice in my veins as I realized the threat she had just made about my own mother, just for lying about her relationship status. I fumbled for a response that struck the right tone, but the response I managed to think of, was a more forceful than I first intended, 



“No! Absolutely not! Why would you even think that?” I immediately felt guilty, but also scared of her response to the mental retort I had just assaulted her with. I had no idea if she might feel anger at me and try to get into my head as retribution. 



There was a painfully long pause and I was about to say something else when a meek and sad response came into my mind, 



 “I was just trying to help my friend. I do not like it when people lie, but especially not to my friends. I’m sorry.” Despite her threat a moment ago, I was surprised when I found myself feeling bad for Matilda and guilty that I had just lashed out at her. Once again, I considered my situation and could not believe I was silently arguing with a porcelain doll. 



The rest of the visit with my mom was nice, bit a bit awkward. I did not bring up Michael, or my dad and I left a bit early. My mom looked relieved and I figured based on the lie from earlier that Michael would be coming over sometime later that day. 



I said goodbye and got on the road back home. As I was considering what to do about the entire situation, I almost rear ended the car in front of me. I had to slam on my brakes as I had run into a rather unusual amount of traffic congestion on the way back home. It was not normally a busy road so I was surprised there would be traffic. Unless there was construction or something slowing things down, this was very strange.. Eventually I had inched far enough in the single lane of moving traffic to see what had happened. What I saw I could barely believe. 



It was the red car that had almost hit me from earlier that day. It was blocking the right lane of traffic and was flipped over on its top. Apparently, it was some sort of accident. Considering the driver I was not surprised, with how reckless he seemed. Yet I saw something else more horrifying. The driver was not in the car. There was a ton of police nearby and I saw what looked like a crime scene, setup in the area. Then I saw what looked like a body bag and knew the likely fate of the man. 



The whole scene was disturbing, the guy was an asshole, but to die like that, that was brutal. Then I heard on the news later that evening that it was worse than I first thought. 



Apparently, the man had randomly assaulted responding officers after flipping his car and he was shot to death as a result. Witnesses at the scene had said he was raving about the officers knowing, “The truth about him”. They also said that the man had attacked them in order to get them to shoot, saying that “We would all be better off without reckless jerks like me in the world.”  



As I read the man’s last words my heart sank and I froze in fear. I thought about what I had said to Matilda and I looked over to her sitting on the counter and smiling playfully back at me. My mind was racing and I was overwhelmed with anxiety.  



When I was heading to my room to go to sleep, I finally mustered the will to ask her, 



“Matilda, I need you to tell me something. What did you do earlier today?” 



There was a small pause and I heard what sounded like a tittering laugh followed by a response of, 



“What I always do, I just showed someone the truth. In this case the truth was just what my friend had said. We would all be better off without reckless jerks like that in the world. 



Good night my friend, have a good sleep.”  I pushed back the feeling of apprehension and fear long enough to mutter back a meek, “Good Night Matilda.” 



Then the presence left the room and I felt a deep feeling of dread at what would happen next if someone else was caught telling lies. I had to think of something to do about my new friend.
