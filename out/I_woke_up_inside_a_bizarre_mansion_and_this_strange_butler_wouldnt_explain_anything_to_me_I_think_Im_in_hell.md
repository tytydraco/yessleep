I found myself staring at a large and imposing set of doors. They were heavily embellished with lavish, royal ornaments filling up the canvas with gold as its main theme. The ground trembled violently under my feet as I pushed the doors inward.  


An endless, vast corridor engulfs me, the ceiling so high the light fails to reach it. It appeared I was inside some sort of castle. A red royal carpet guides my gaze towards the end of what I thought now was the courtroom. An impending sense of dread began to crawl up my back as I started walking, and my breath sharpened with each step. The air was deathly silent. It offered no comfort and spared no whisper.  


I had no sense of time, though it felt like I walked for days. At some point, my vision began to blur, and I felt my legs about to yield. As I prepared to collapse, my eyes caught glimpse of a silhouette of some distant object. I somehow managed to adjust my eyes as it steadily came into view.

 

An empty throne stared back, and my legs suddenly fail me as they could no longer bear my weight. As I fell down, my mind lit up with surreal and terrible visions and unlocked alien memories of unknown people’s journeys, predicaments, and their gruesome deaths.

 

I spring back to life, for lack of a better description, and find myself hoarding air as I struggle to calm myself down. My mind must not have been fully present at the time, as it took some time for me to notice where I was sat up.  


Around me was what I could only describe as my own stereotypical idea of what a *very* expensive mansion entrance hall would look like. Though it appeared less a mansion and more a castle the more you looked around. And for some reason, I could not help but feel a vague sense of familiarity the more I did.  


Once again, I must have been so engulfed in the aristocratic scenery around me that I didn’t notice the man standing directly over me. I clumsily gasp out of it and pull away as the man gestures for me to calm down. He was visibly old, like a man in his 50s, maybe early 60s. He wore classical butler attire complemented with a mustache and had an early 19th-century feel overall.

“My deepest apologies, sir.” The Butler says, guilt visually stricken on his face. “I did not wish to interrupt your contemplation, but it appears I was not wise in my approach for someone so unwonted either.”

My confusion soon overcomes my panic as I just begin to realize how bizarre this entire situation is.

“What *is* all of this? Where the hell am I?” I ask impatiently.

The Butler pauses before answering, taking a moment to inspect me as he does.

“Why, you have been called here, of course!”

“Called? No one called me anywhere. And why do you keep talking like that?” I said as I stood myself up.

“I’m very afraid I cannot reveal anything as of now, sir.” The Butler explained. You could sense an air of pity in his tone.

“For now, please follow me along this way. I must show you where to go.”

Right as my mouth opened to speak, The Butler began moving towards one of the hallways.

“God damn it, where the hell are you going?!”

The Butler paid no mind and didn’t change his pace. Having no choice, I begrudgingly follow The Butler further into the estate.

The hallway followed the same theme as the entrance hall, it was vast in its dimensions and looked like it stretched on for miles, and somehow never running out of decoration, with doors placed on either side on occasion.

I begin to lose patience as we have been walking silently for a while. I start to wonder if this is all just a dream.

“Do you know why you’re here, sir?” The Butler cut my thoughts short.

“No? I said I know nothing. All you told me was that I have been ‘called’. I still don’t know what that means.”

The Butler keeps silent for a moment.

“I see. May I ask if you remember your name?”

Bewildered by the nature of the question, I take a second to make sure I heard it right.

“What are you talking about, of course I do.” I say dismissively. “My name is…...” But nothing came up. I try once then twice, nothing. How could I not remember my own name? Panic begins to set in as I search inside every nook and cranny inside my own mind, but to no avail.

“How untimely. It must be getting worse, then.” The Butler sighed.

“What is getting worse? What’s going on here? Am I dead or something?”

The Butler silently tilts his head down as he walks, seemingly unsure of what to say.

“Are you going to explain anything at all?!” I pleaded.

“I wish I could spare you the anguish.” He began. “Yours is a most unfortunate fate, but a fate most warranted. This *ground* on which you walk and this *air* from which you breathe and this *gallery* through which we speak did not manifest unto you for not. You were not the first. You are not the last. The soul that finds itself within these walls must not abandon hope lest it never escapes this terrible confinement.”

To say I was baffled was if to say a mountain weighed pebbles. Thoughts stumbled upon thoughts to no outcome. Was this a prank? None of my friends are that rich, that’s for sure. But I don’t remember who my friends are. Who's my family? Do I have a family? Am I married? Did I do something terrible? A thousand questions chaotically lined themselves up inside my mind, and I started to question my own grip on reality.

“I… don’t understand. What is going to happen to me?”

“This will all depend on you entirely, my good sir.” The Butler replied, finally coming to a stop and motioning for me to look beyond the corner.  


A black wooden door stared back, noticeably different from the usual opulence and had the wall all to itself. There was an unmistakable, yet indescribable sense of *malice* coming from that door. Something about it urged my primal instincts to stay as far away from it as possible.  


“I know.” The Butler cast a sympathetic look, placing a hand on my shoulder. He then proceeded to guide us toward the unsightly door.

“I never asked till now…who are you exactly?” I asked sheepishly.

“Why, I’m the butler, of course.” The old Butler explained with a smile. “Here we are.” We were now stood directly in front of the door.

Up this close, the door felt uncannily alive, like I could hear its breathing, and almost like it could swing open and swallow me whole if I lingered for too long.

“Make no mistake, beyond that door is your *only* path to salvation. It is one relentless journey full of treacherous trials and *horrifying* endings should you fail. And it is one you must partake in alone.”

By now dear reader, you could probably imagine the valley of predicament I was situated in. I don’t remember my name. I don’t remember my family or friends. I wake up from a strange nightmare into some overly lavish castle to an old friendly butler telling me of an even more terrible fate that awaits me beyond a stereotypically scary looking door.

Not knowing what else to do and without anything else to say, I take another look at the door before The Butler steps forward to unlock it. I brace myself as I prepare to meet whatever horror was on the other side.

Nothing. Nothing but a dark, pitch-black empty void. Gazing inside was frightening, but stepping in felt like it would plunge me into its never-ending abyss, with a fate I’d prefer not to think about too much.

I glance back at The Butler. He nods firmly.

“Don’t worry. Whatever happens, I will be waiting for you here, as always.”

I wanted to nod back, as if give myself the vaguest sense of certainty, but that was just too absurd.

I turn back to the void beside me, take a deep breath and slowly step in, the light from my peripheral steadily fading away. Each step felt surreal, as I could feel no ground beneath me and I waited for betrayal at any moment.

I take one last look behind me and find The Butler standing at the doorway. He waved one last goodbye and gradually closed the door, engulfing me in an ominous and completely silent darkness.
