Let me tell you and old story first.

There were 12 "fallen angels",

12 "fallen angels", each with a different reason and goal.

12 fallen from the sky, in the times before what "years" or "minutes" or "days", etc., was known, in the 12. province of Obscurité, right in front of the 12. mountain, a lot of 12's, actually.

11 "angels", atleast that's what they thought, started to roam Obscurité, striking faith and hope into people's hearts at first, thinking they were messengers sent to them, but everything changed as the 12. appeared.

The Twelfth "Angel". The Dark One- no, the Darker One, actually.

It spread terror, then realization dawned on the early People of Obscurité, these were not Angels that have fallen, but something sinister, something even more than evil.

They struggled to stop the Twelfth, they begged for help, then, suddenly, as the Older Powers, the "Angels" suddenly declared war on each other.

Hundreds, thousands dying as their true forms, beings of unlightable darkness, pure chaos, complete voids, was revealed.

But some of the Earlier People of Obscurité saw them as divine beings, as they were here to "cleanse" the world, to make it "better"...

As their war raged, the First, sealed all of them, including itself under the 12 Churchs.

Which was, actually named "churchs" after it, because of the Worshippers of Older Powers, after years and years, all people thought that they were just "cultist nonsense"...

They were not. Atleast the Twelfth is not.

I was a hotheaded teenager, I kinda liked to explore the ruins right outside my hometown, with friends, of course. I never told their families what happened.

We got some flaslights, a camera, that kind of stuff. I would've took a cross instead if I knew what was going to happen.

We entered the ruins, they were old, dirty, and silent, dead silent and cold as a December night was falling. We started walking around, looking for anything interesting, then I saw something.

Blood, all over the place, bright red blood, new blood.

New blood.

I told them to go back, I said there was something bad happening here, they didn't listen, and they forced me to continue with them.

We wandered deeper into the ruins, ancient drawings covering the walls, alongside with skeletons on the ground, but we continued, going deeper and deeper.

We finally came to an giant room, and a giant coffin, bigger than 2 fully grown men, was lying on the ground, burned skeletons scattered all over it and on the floor.

Then I saw them, corpses, new corpses.

All of them standing in praying position, all of them was probably killed brutally.

I told them again, and they listened this time, but the door was sealed.

The door, which was a giant stone actually, was sealed, purple runes glowing on it, then suddenly, a loud voice echoed through the room.

The voice was... ancient, multiple, like a chorus was speaking in unison, with a hint of screams of pain.

It spoke, it said we should open the coffin, it should we should place *one of us* inside it, then we were free to go...

We were shocked, we were already thinking we were all going to die, but we needed to do something, even if it meant sacrificing someone to some demonic voice, but we needed to do something fast.

Suddenly, I felt hands, before I could do something, my "friends" took me and tried to place me inside the coffin.

I begged them to stop, I said it was not worth it, I said we could find another way...

They put me in and closed the coffin.

Then the voice spoke again.

"Hmm... So you **do** really obey to anything when you just want to stay alive, huh?" it said,

"Then, little filthy traitors, hmm, I will let only one of you get out of here." it said.

I was shocked, but what happened next shocked me even more.

I heard noises, they started attacking each other, I heard them killing each other, brutally.

Then, it spoke once again.

"Great, you entertain me, filthy rat. But the one I would let go was not any of you."

Then I heard fire. And screams. Lots of screams, before the coffin opened, and I was in the middle of a forest.

The police came, asked what happened, but I couldn't answer, I couldn't.

It's been a long time since it now, but please, please don't do what I did. What my friends did. It only leads to pain and despair.
