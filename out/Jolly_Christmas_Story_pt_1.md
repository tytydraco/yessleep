When I was little my whole family was over one night for Christmas dinner. My family was different, we always had dinner on Christmas Eve instead of actual Christmas. My name is Thomas and the story I'm about to tell you changed it for me. I was around five at the time I was insanely obsessed with Christmas. It was like a birthday for everyone you could say but this night was different for me. 

Me and my family were having Christmas dinner (on Christmas Eve) and we all ate an amazing meal made by my mom, aunt, and grandma. There was ham, mashed potatoes, bread rolls, etc. and when we all finished we all went to watch a movie. I don't remember what movie it was but for the sake of this story I'll say it was Home Alone. My family was a big popcorn eater so we made bowls and bowls. We ate popcorn all together. It was really butter-y. I remembered that as well. 

After we finished our movie and popcorn my family left to go home. I went upstairs to go get ready for bed. I brushed my teeth, put on my Cars pajamas, and layed down to sleep. I always had a hard time sleeping, I still do in my adult years because of my insomnia. So when I finally went to bed it didn't last that long because I had that experience where you wake up to a noise but you don’t know what that noise is, yeah that’s what happened. 

When I woke up I felt really thirsty so I went downstairs to get water as I was on the last step that's when I saw him. You can guess who it was. If not I'll give you a couple hints fat and jolly, yup santa I saw old saint nick or so i thought. What was weird was he was much skinnier and his jolly red outfit looked torn and ragged when he turned and around I saw his ugly, deranged, cut up,and not jolly face. I got scared when I first saw him because I didn’t realize who it was but then he did his iconic laugh and said “why are you up?”  I said back to him  ”I’m thirsty a-and I heard a noise”. 

Then I noticed his skin was a bit paler so I asked “Are you not feeling well Santa?” He replied “I’m fine, I just need some cookies and milk” so I walked towards the plate of cookies and milk I left out and handed it to him. I also went to get my cup of water. I couldn't reach the cups so I asked Santa “can you get me a cup” he replied with “ok just give me a second” he grabbed the cup and filled it with water. What I thought was weird is that he creepily smiled at me all the time, then he sent me back to my room and I fell asleep eventually. Then suddenly I woke up to the noise of my mother screaming. I went down stairs and saw there were no presents but there was something….the dead remains of my dog and there was a note that read “have a jolly christmas”.
