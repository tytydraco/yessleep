My family has always had a knack for collections. My mother hoarded porcelain cats, each one numbered and named, their tiny painted faces lined up in neat rows on shelves that ran the length of the living room. My father curated shelves of vintage cameras, each meticulously labeled with its make and year. He spent hours in his darkroom, polishing lenses with obsessive care, murmuring to himself like a priest before an altar. My older sister catalogued every movie ticket she ever bought, arranged chronologically and cross-referenced by director. Even as a teenager, she carried a battered ledger everywhere, making careful notations about runtime, cast, and box office performance.

Me? I never had a collection. I hated how those obsessions seemed to define them, even trap them. My mother once missed my school play because she was chasing a rare ceramic kitten two towns over. My father often missed dinner, hunched over a tripod or bent under the red glow of his darkroom light. My sister, when she wasn’t buried in her ticket stubs, seemed more invested in preserving the past than living in the present. Their collections weren’t just hobbies—they were identities, consuming and isolating them. 

When my mother passed last year, the family house—a sprawling Victorian with gingerbread trim and a wild, overgrown garden—became mine. My father had died years ago, and my sister had moved overseas, leaving me the sole heir to their legacy. It wasn’t just the house. It was the collections.

I didn’t want the responsibility, but there was no avoiding it. I spent weeks cleaning, sorting, cataloguing. The house felt alive, as though it had been waiting for someone to pay attention to it. Every creak of the floorboards, every groan of the old pipes—it all seemed deliberate, like the house was breathing along with me. The porcelain cats stared down at me from their shelves, their unblinking eyes tracking my every move. My father’s cameras sat in neat rows, their lenses catching and reflecting the faintest light, giving the impression they were watching.

There was one part of the house I avoided: the dining room cabinet. It had always been locked, and as a kid, I assumed it held the good china—the kind reserved for guests we never had. But as I sifted through the clutter, I found a key taped to the underside of a dining chair. My curiosity got the better of me.

The cabinet didn’t hold plates. It held jars.

Dozens of glass jars, each meticulously labeled in neat, familiar handwriting. My mother’s handwriting—the same looping script that adorned every porcelain cat’s base. Each jar was filled with a fine, greyish dust that shimmered faintly when it caught the light.

I picked one up at random.

The name on the label didn’t ring a bell. At first, I assumed it was another of my mother’s peculiar collections—a relic of her obsessive tendencies. But something about the jars unsettled me. I couldn’t quite explain it, but the weight of the jar in my hand felt wrong, as though it were heavier than it should have been for its size.

That night, I dreamed of my mother. She stood in the dining room, her back to me, her hands busy arranging jars on the table. When I called her name, she turned, but her face was blurred, as though smudged with an eraser. She pointed to the cabinet, and when I woke, the image of her outstretched hand lingered in my mind like a stain.

The next morning, there was a jar on the dining table that hadn’t been there the night before.

I was sure I had locked the cabinet. I double-checked it, inspected the jars, counted them. Nothing seemed out of place. I told myself I must have missed it during my inventory, but the same thing happened the next night, and then a week later. Each of those mornings a new jar appeared on the table, each labeled with a name I didn’t recognise.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that the jars were important. They felt alive in some way, humming faintly in the back of my mind whenever I was near them. Their presence was heavy, oppressive, as though the air around them had thickened.

The breaking point came when I started cross-referencing the names with local history. Each name belonged to someone who had gone missing in the area over the past 40 years.

My family wasn’t just collecting objects. They were collecting people.

That night, I decided to confront whatever—or whoever—was responsible. I set up a chair in the corner of the dining room, armed with nothing but a flashlight and my growing paranoia. The house seemed to hold its breath as the hours crawled by. The faintest sounds—floorboards settling, the hum of the refrigerator—felt amplified, each one setting my nerves on edge.

At 3:15 a.m., the air turned cold. My breath fogged in front of me, and a faint smell of acrid smoke and mold wafted through the room. Then, he appeared.

The man stepped out from the shadows, impossibly tall, his disintegrating burgundy suit clinging to his skeletal frame. His face was pale, waxy, as though it had been sculpted from candle wax and left too close to a flame. His eyes glinted like polished obsidian, bottomless and unreadable. He moved with a deliberate grace, placing a jar on the table with a kind of reverence.

“You’re not supposed to watch,” he said, his voice smooth and unhurried, like the creak of a slowly opening door.

I gripped the flashlight tighter. “Who are you?”

He smiled faintly, a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “The Collector, of course.”

“What are you collecting?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

He didn’t respond. Instead, he pointed to the cabinet. “Keep them safe,” he said. Then, he was gone, melting back into the shadows as though he had never been there at all.

In the days that followed, I tried to leave. I packed my bags, tried to call my sister, even attempted to list the house online. But every attempt was thwarted. The car wouldn’t start. The phone wouldn’t dial. Emails failed to send. Local realtors refused to even look at the property.

The house had trapped me.

The jars kept appearing. And the names grew familiar. A neighbour. The clerk from the grocery store. A childhood friend I hadn’t seen in years. Each one a silent accusation, a reminder of how small and interconnected my world had become.

I wanted to hate the jars, to smash them and scatter their dust. Free the souls they held. But something stopped me. The jars felt sacred, important, as though destroying them would unravel something far greater than I could comprehend.

Then I found the two jars hidden at the very back of the cabinet.

Two jars. My parent’s names.

The sight of them shattered something inside me. Their collections, their obsessions—they hadn’t been harmless quirks. They had been symptoms of something darker, something that had consumed them completely.

This morning, I found a new jar on the table. It didn’t have a name. Just a blank label and a pen beside it.

I think it’s my turn.
