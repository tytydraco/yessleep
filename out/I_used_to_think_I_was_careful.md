I used to think I was careful. I locked my doors at night. Sometimes, I checked twice—probably pot-induced paranoia. But I never lost my keys, never left my bag on the train—well, once, but I was exhausted.

I wasn’t the type to forget things and I’d never be the kind of person to forget something as simple as turning off a light.

Yet, a few weeks ago, I woke up and found the hallway light still on.

I stood there, staring at it, my mind sluggish with sleep. The switch was in the on position. I could have sworn I flipped it before bed.

Maybe I was mistaken. Maybe I’d been tired. Maybe I only *thought* I had flipped it.

Then, a few days later, I found my coffee cup in the sink, brown residue at the bottom. I didn’t remember making it. I definitely didn’t remember drinking it.

I live alone.

Maybe it’s stress. Work is killing me. Deadlines piling up. The office feels like the little gangs we used to form during recess—kids from the villages nearby sticking together against kids from the city. Except now, it’s the older bickering women against the younger generation, and I’m stuck in the middle at forty years old.

*Too young to be bitter. Too old to be cool.*

Maybe it’s the weed. I’ve been smoking more to forget I’m not where I wanted to be in life. Never got a promotion. Never traveled. Just stuck in the same apartment, the same job, the same endless loop.

Maybe I’m sleepwalking. Mom used to sleepwalk. It’s probably something genetic. 

But… none of that explains the bathroom mirror.

One morning, I walked in to find it fogged up, faint streaks cutting through the steam like someone had dragged their fingers across the glass. But I hadn’t showered yet. I hadn’t even turned the water on.

My scalp prickled. My stomach twisted itself into knots. I stood there, watching, waiting, as if the streaks would shift under my gaze, as if something—someone—my reflection might move on the other side of the glass.

I told myself it was nothing.

I started sleeping with the lights on.

Then, a few nights ago, I woke up to the sound of floorboards creaking. Slow. Deliberate. A shift of weight from one foot to the other.

The building is old. The wood settles. That’s all it is.

*That’s all it has to be.*

But last night, it was different.

A soft click. Like a door latch releasing.

I jolted awake, heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat.

I stayed still, ears straining against the quiet.

I wanted to believe I was dreaming. That my brain was playing tricks on me. That it was just another symptom of my fraying mind.

I unlocked my phone, the screen glared back at me: **3:17 AM.**

The air in my apartment felt heavy, suffocating. The room was silent, except for the faint hum of the fridge down the hall.

I held my breath.

Listening.

Maybe I imagined it. Maybe I was half-asleep, my mind filling in the gaps with something worse.

But I didn’t want to get up.

I didn’t want to check.

Because what if—*what if I forgot to lock the door?*

What if there’s someone standing in the hallway right now, just outside my bedroom?

I turned my phone’s brightness down. If someone was here, I didn’t want them to see the glow.

I forced myself to stay still. My fingers clenched the sheets, nails pressing into my palm.

Minutes passed.

Then more.

Nothing.

I almost convinced myself I was being paranoid again. That my mind was just playing cruel tricks on me.

Until I saw the shadow under the door.

A sliver of darkness moving against the dim glow from the hallway.

It wasn’t still. It wasn’t furniture. It shifted—slow, deliberate, dragging across the floor like it was testing the space before each step.

My chest seized. I didn’t dare breathe.

I wanted to run, to jump out of the window, to do something, but I couldn’t move.

*I couldn’t move.*

I squeezed my eyes shut. Counted to ten. Twenty. When I opened them again—

The shadow was gone.

Silence.

Just the fridge humming.

I stayed awake until dawn.

And when the sun finally bled through the curtains, I forced myself to get up, to check the apartment, to tell myself it was nothing.

I didn't find anything this morning.

But the thing is… I stopped turning *off* my bedroom light days ago.

And last night, I woke up in the dark.
