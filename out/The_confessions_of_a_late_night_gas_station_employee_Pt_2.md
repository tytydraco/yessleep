Hey guys, sorry it’s taken me so long to update you all, I’ve had some unexpected family problems and was out of town for a while. Things have been weirdly slow for the past few weeks, “It” has not visited since the last time. I’m not sure if I should be relieved or paranoid, but so far everything just seems to be the same as always. Well except for the fact I’ve become friendlier with my… customers? I feel weird calling them that because while most of them do pay (I’ve decided long ago not to question where they get the money), I'm not certain what they do with what they buy. Do they eat? The amount of gum and cigarettes are concerning considering some don't have teeth, or lungs I assume.

Anyways, sorry for rambling I know you aren’t reading this to hear about ghosts and ghouls chewing fucking bubble gum. There have been no real standouts from my usual clientele, although the ghouls who run on all fours have been visiting more often. I’ve taken to leaving bits of beef jerky lying around for when they appear, I feel weirdly bad just giving them trash to make them go away. It's strange to say but they almost remind me of stray dogs, despite looking like a starved ghoulish-humanoid with no face.

The only thing that bothers me about them is that I swear I’ve seen them following me, and not just while I'm in or around the station. I’ve never seen them straight on, but I constantly see what looks like them scampering in alley ways while I walk home. I'm not sure what this means - god I sound fucking insane saying this but I dont think they want to hurt me? They’ve never shown any aggression towards me but I have the distinct feeling they’re watching me.

Besides the crawlers, I’ve also had somewhat groundbreaking conversations with the more humanoid-ish patrons, I mentioned in my last post that I considered asking them questions and I have! I was careful, but I managed to earn their trust I think. It's nothing crazy, just simple questions like “Where are you off to?” which typically is answered with vague things like “Oh, y’know, around,” or “Out.” I guess they appreciated that I never try to dig into their answers, because they have begun asking more questions.

The questions however have done nothing but fuel my paranoia that they’re harming people, the worst ones so far have been asking what certain types of people would buy or like. Things like “What do women usually buy from here,” “What type of cigarettes do people usually buy,” or the worst one yet “What candy do kids buy?” I know you all have said not to get involved, and I am trying. You’ve told me it isn’t my moral obligation to help, but kids? What if they’re hurting children? The nightmares have been worse since that one, and I'm still being watched by the crows and crawlers. What if they’re following me to make sure I keep my mouth shut?

That's all I can stomach talking about right now, I'm sorry. I will answer some of the usual questions though. I have never followed them out of the door, and don’t plan to. I have never given them my name because they haven’t asked but I have a feeling “It” already knows my name. As to how I got the job? It's painfully boring considering the shit that happens, I just talked to the day staff and practically got hired on the spot. Never met the owners or even talked to them (no one minus the oldest employee but even then it was through the phone), but yes I still get paid exactly on time.

As for the crows, I actually started feeding them after they kept banging on my windows. Another crow has joined the little gang that stalks me so now it’s eleven. I know it's lame but sometimes I talk to them, it's not like I can tell any of my loved ones this shit y’know? Sometimes they leave me objects they find, mostly gum wrappers, nails, and some other shiny stuff.

I still know absolutely nothing about my situation, and I'm still searching for answers. I keep debating whether I should just accept this as my new life, or try and run before things get really bad.
