Our little team of four are made of paleontologists and archeologists, two of us were this the other two were that, so there was always your partner to discuss anything you found. We came to Hungary last week and settled in a camp where we resided in a two floor wooden house. Two of us shared a room on the first floor, there were two rooms, on the ground floor were the kitchen and the bathroom.

Our excavation site is in the Bakony mountain near to our camp. There wasn't any problems or anything special, though only Thomas speaks Hungarian so it's a bit difficult to communicate with the people around here.

Until the fifth of July, I found a very weird skeleton under a rolled boulder. I was alone because my teammates were working on something Sam found. So I decided to excavate it, alone. It took me hours to get the stone off of one side of it. But I couldn't believe what was I looking at. The creature was around 220 cm tall and 3 meters long whit tail, the front and the hind legs were nearly the same length so it could walk on four and two legs, a long whip like tail to balance the weight of the creature when it was on it's hind legs, the head was really weird. It resembles a human skull but it's a bit elongated, at the back of the skull were some small spike like bones poking out–probably there was skin between like a sail– , the teeth were implementing this was a carnivorous animal, but these teeth were a little thin, but long and very durable.

After examining the skeleton I realised that I haven't brought my camera, so I needed to go back to our camp. I got back, grabbed the camera and headed back to the place. But when I got back, there was nothing in the rocks. I was scared as fuck, so I took out my flashlight to search the area. I didn't get far when I heard something moving near me I got scared. I looked aroundto find the source of the noise.

I turned around and noticed a large grey creature, it looked like a dinosaur. I screamed and I ran. I turned on the flashlight to see if I can spot it. The light fell in the eyes of it and it took off running. It chased me but I was too fast so it couldn't catch up with me. I ran to the nearest tree and climbed up, I broke a branch that hit it's head. It left, but I didn't trust that. It was started to get dark so I climbed down to find nothing there, so I went back to our camp. Before I couldget in the house I heard a growling sound from behind, it was here. Grey, reptilian skin, a mouth somewhat showing the long pointy teeth, a little sail made of small bones and skin Iin-between them, and a slightly yellow pair of hypnotising eyes.

As I looked at it I freaked out and dropped on the ground. It started to get closer,so I got up and ran inside and slammed the door. The thing scratchedon the door, walked around trying to get in. I sat there,  my heart racing. Sam woke up to the noise and came to see what is going on.

"What are you doing? Sholdn'you be asleep in our room?" she asked.

"There's a... a dinosaur like this at the door!"

"You can't be serious."

"I am fucking serious, it's outside and trying to get in, it chased me before."

"I hear nothing"

"What? It was scraping the door a minute ago."

"Should we check what your 'dinosaur' was doing?"

I hardly agree and we go outside. The thing was nowhere to be found, but there was writing in the ground saying:

"Gyere vissza oda hol megtaláltad holnap éjjel. Elmondom mit tudnotok kell és mit szeretnétek hallani"

We didn't understand it so we woke up Thomas and asked him to translate. He told us it says "Come back where you found it tomorrow night. I will tell everything you need to know and what you desire to learn"

We stood there with confusion but decided to go back to bed and try to sleep, but this time I opened the window to see if I can catch sight of the creature, I didn' success, so I went to bed, but coldn't sleep. What is that monstrous creature? What does it want? Who wrote that message? Was it the beast or someone else? These questions kept me up at that night.

It was very quiet at the camp this night, and I haven't slept much, so I didn't notice when Thomas walked in our room.

"I was thinking about the message that your 'found one' left behind" said Thomas

Sam was still sleeping.

"What about it?" I said.

"I think it is trying to tell us something"

"Maybe the monster left it behind."

"It could be."

"Really?"

"Do you think I'm stupid? No of course not. It must have been someone who saw you. We need to find anythink useful they might left behind"

I put on some new clothes that I brought from home. I was ready to go and Thomas helped me in dragging my backpack as well. We walked to the place where I found the skeleton.

"It left a clue, what should it be?" I asked Thomas as we walked up the river.

"They was definitely writing the message for you. If they want to tell anybody what's going on."

We got there, it was the same as I left it. Empty, whitout any mark or any lead we could follow.

"Damn. A dead end, there aren't anything we can follow! I think we need to come back at night, then they might tell us something useful."

"Sounds like a good idea. Let's go back to the camp."

We headed back and got things done, eventually the evening came. Thomas and I didn't sleep much, when we woke up we decided to see if the they was keeping their promise or not. So we walked to the site again, and as soon as we got there, Thomas pointed his flashlight in the rocks and it hit something, it was our messenger.

" So you decided to come" he said with a very broken English, but we understood it.

"We came for answers!" I said as he sat down on a rock in front of us.

" I'll tell you everything you need then you can ask whatever you want."

"Okay."

"Great! As I know you four are working on an excavation site. and you" he pointed at me "freed the monster whowas tuck in the limestone."

"Who are you?"

"My name is Tibor, but you can call me Tibi."

"So... Tibi... what is that creature?"

"His name is Rega, the pet of an acient god. The other gods didn't like Rega because he was powerful, so not so long ago they sent him here,  deprived of most of his power. Twenty years ago he got caught in a landslide, and you freed him."

"How long has he been here?"

"Not longer than a hundred years." he tilted his head "You need to know that you can't dig here any more, because this place is his territory, but if you do, he will hunt you down until either you end yourself or he kills you. So be careful."

"Okay. We will be careful."

"Then goodbye, and good luck finding anything interesting." he got up and walked into the dark forest before we could say anything.

"We need to tell the girls what he told us!"

"Yeah" we headed back to our camp and told the girls everything, unless the exact place where we went so they not even by accident could take anything from there.

The next day we decided to relax and went down to the Balaton. We got back in the afternoon and rested a bit exept for Anne, she still got energy so she decided to take a walk, maybe evenbring back something. We let her and put on a horror movie.

She got back at night giving us a jump as she slammed the door.

"You nearly gave me a heart attack!"

"Why did you jump that big?" she asked sarcastically

I pointed at the TV as the monster jumpscared Thomas and Sam

"Damn, did I just miss that? Anyway, how was your walk?"

"It was refreshing. I even found a cool vase."

"Oh, where did you find it?"

"Up the river."

My heart sipped a beat. "You need to get rid of that immediatly!"

"Aren't we supposed to dig up old bones and stuff?"

"Not from THAT place!"

"What? Is this thing cursed? Am I gonna die? OOoooOOooo."

"Anne this is serious, you need to bring that thing back where you found it or else you-"

We heard a loud bang outside and a blood curdling roar.The lights went out. Rega is here.

"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!" Sam asked as she grabbed for a flashlight

"It's him, he came for Anne because she took from where we shouldn't have!"

"Why didn't you tell me where was that place?!"

"I thought you wouldn't find it!" I ran to the front door and looked out from the window next to it. He was there growling in anger, when he saw me he rammed against the door.We felt as the wooden house trembled as threw himself against the main door.

"This won't stand for long get anything useful and get to our room!" he threw himself against the door and there wasa hole in the door, he stuck his hand inside trying to grab something. I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and stabbed his hand. He hissed but didn't pull it out, he tried to grab me as he swung his hand in my direction. His claws ripped in my clothes and broke up some of the planks on the floor.

"JIM GET UP HERE NOW!" I heard Anne shouting

I ran upstairs, salm the door behind myself as I hear loud crackle of the main door.

"We need to barricade this door." I said as I tipped the cabinet over that was next to the door. They pushed a bed together and we flipped it.

We heard as he tried to get in the bedroom. He stopped, he walked out what we didn't understand. Then I saw the glowing orange eyes in the window turning blood red, and a furious loud roar. Somehow he climbed up on the walls to the bedroom window after seeing that he can't get the bedroom door to break.

We retreated and started to search for any tool or material we could use as a weapon. Meanwhile he punched the glass of the window and managed to brake one of the glass panels.He tried to get inside growling and hissing when Thomas shut the other panel in his face. He only got his head and one arm in when I grabbed a broom, broke it and stabbed his eye. He screeched in pain and got more angry, I tried to stab him again but he grabbed the broom and broke it without effort, he used the broken piece in his hand to hit Sam as he throw it at her trying to hit me. She fell on the floor with a bleeding head and Thomas rushed to help her. Then there was a gunshot, Rega screeched in pain and fell out of the window on the ground with a loud thud. It was Anne, she used Thomas's gun he bought with himself.

"Finally oyur gun is useful for something. Is it dead? I aimed for his head."

"I doubt it." I looked out of the window to see the beast get up shaking, he looked at me and ran to the side of the house. "Is Sam okay?"

"Yeah. She got hit hard, but she will be fine." said Thomas as he bandaged Sam's wounds

"We need to get out of here, he will not give up this easily. We must call the police or some authority to get us out of here."

"I don't want to interrupt you Jim but do you also hear a hissing sound or did he hit my head really hard?" Sam asked

"No I also hear it" the air was smelling like rotting eggs. "Fuck, there's a gas leak! We need to get out of here quick!"

"How? We can only climb out or the window!"

"Then we are going there! I will go first and find a ladder." But as I looked out of the window to escape I saw him. I froze in place as he held a burning plank looking right in my eyes, he let out a sound that resembled laughing. I stood there as Anne got next to me and she also froze. He smiled and tossed the plank in the house.

"REGA YOU SON OF A-" and the gas exploded. I woke up lying on the ground, unable to move, debris and fire everywhere and him standing there cornering Anne who could barely stand, she bitterly cried. I saw Thomas standing behind and shooting him in the head, he merely flinched. He looked at him in fury, swung his tail sending Thomas flying into a spear like piece of wood, piercing and killing him instantly. Then he turned to Anne.

He grabbed her with one hand, he smashed her into the ground three times breaking her spine, she cried in pain, but he wasn't finished, he tore one of her legs off, blood on the ground and him. I heard sirens and blue lights approaching, so did he. He broke Anne's neck and ran off into the dense forest. I couldn't stay awake longer, I fainted.

I woke up in a hospital in the same room as Sam. One of my legs missing, scars and burnmarks over my body. Sam wasn't better, as she told me she needed a surgery because of how much wood debris drilled into her abdomen. She said my left leg was in a worse shape, so it was amputated, the debris is also the cause of our scars. We spent a whole month in the hospital recovering, and planning for the future.

As I'm writing this I'm out of the hospital and gearing up for a trip to end an unfinished business. Let's go to the Bakony! Who's coming?
