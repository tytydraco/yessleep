I love reading.

It's my favorite thing to do at all times. I even made a career out of it by making stories for other people to enjoy.

I am addicted to the emotions stories give me, the fear, the joy, the sorrow, all of them lets me to feel an ecstasy that no drug can mimic. I have resolved myself to give my readers that same ecstasy by capturing emotion in its rawest form 

I have written books in many genres  throughout my career Romance, Historical Fiction, Sci-Fi  Dystopian, Self Help, but Iv'e recently gotten into writing Horror.

While writing my other works of fiction I had to imagine what it would feel like to kiss a ghost, relive a forgotten war, traveling through a wormhole — all of which are just stories nothing people can truly relate too But Horror is different. It’s the most honest genre, the only one where you can give readers the purest emotions—fear, desperation, helplessness—emotions every human knows on an instinctual level. 

And that’s when it hit me. To capture those emotions in their truest form, I needed to experience them myself.

I thought of the hundreds of books I’d written, the countless stories of love and loss, of hope and despair. But none of them had the rawness I craved. I had always relied on my imagination, but imagination could only stretch so far. What if I could make the fear real?

It was a slow realization, the kind that creeps up on you when you’re too deep into the darkness to find your way back. I had killed off countless characters, but they were always just that—characters. They weren’t real. They weren’t human.

But what if I could change that?

I’d heard the rumors. Whispers that writers like me, ones who thrive on creating the most twisted, emotional stories, sometimes pay a price. A dark toll. What if those stories—the ones we write about pain and death—demanded something in return? What if, to write the most powerful story, I had to draw from the ultimate source of terror?

I didn’t just want fear. I wanted the kind of fear that makes you feel like you’re going to die. The kind that freezes your heart and twists your stomach until you can’t breathe. That’s the emotion I needed to write.

And so, I set my plan in motion.

The first was easy. She was a woman who lived alone. No family, no close friends, just a quiet soul who went about her days unnoticed. I had watched her for weeks, studying her movements, understanding the rhythm of her life. I needed her to feel true fear, something that could only be born from isolation.

I waited for the right moment. The house was dark, the streets empty. I approached her from behind, knowing she’d never hear me coming. The terror in her eyes when she realized she wasn’t alone—it was perfect. She screamed, but the sound didn’t escape her lips, it seemed to get trapped in the room with us. Her fear was thick, palpable. It was raw. I could taste it in the air, the desperation pouring off of her in waves.

It wasn’t until she was gone, until her life had slipped away, that I realized something horrible.

Her terror—it was *real*.

I wasn’t just writing it anymore. I was *living* it.

And that was just the beginning.

Each victim, each moment of fear I created, only fueled the story further. I would wait for them to feel it, to experience the horror in the purest form, and when they did, I took it. Every ounce of their terror became a part of my work. Each scream, each breath, became a word on the page.

I didn’t care what they thought of me anymore. The people who once admired my work, who praised my books, had no idea what I was doing. They didn’t know that the stories I wrote—those masterpieces they devoured—were born of real pain, real suffering.

It wasn’t enough anymore. Writing about it wasn’t enough. I had to feel it, to breathe it in like a poison that would make me write faster, deeper, more intensely.

The second was harder. I had to find someone who could give me a fear unlike any other, someone whose terror would shake me to the core. I found him in the form of a man, a young man who was always on edge, always looking over his shoulder. He knew something was coming—he just didn’t know what.

I cornered him in an abandoned building, making sure he was alone. The moment I saw him, I knew: this was the one who would give me what I needed. His panic was like a drug, coursing through me as I drove him deeper into madness, feeding off his every frantic movement.

And then, just as I’d done before, I took it. His fear. His final scream. His life.

It was intoxicating.

But with every life I took, I felt myself slipping further. I wasn’t just writing horror anymore. I *was* the horror. The voices started then—the whispers in the dead of night, the faces of my victims appearing in my peripheral vision. I could see them, even when I shut my eyes. Their eyes, wide with fear, staring at me.

I didn’t know how to stop. The stories had consumed me. Each life, each moment of terror, became part of me. They were no longer separate from my work. They were my work.

And now, the terror that had once driven me to write was now the terror that defined me.

Would it ever end? Would the next victim be the one to break me? Or would I keep going, driven by the hunger for the next raw emotion, the next heart-stopping moment of fear?
