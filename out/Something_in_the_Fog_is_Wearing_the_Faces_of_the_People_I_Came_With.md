Underneath everything I’ve touched—everything I’ve *seen*, everything I’ve *become*—there’s this moment. A moment sharp as glass, where it all hits me like a scream trapped in the walls. And there it is, staring me in the face: escape was never an option. Not really. We were always heading toward this, weren’t we? From the second Danica turned her cursed lens toward that forsaken town, the moment we all stepped into that murky, dead-eyed void, it was sealed. Fate, or something worse, locked in place.

And now? Now I sit here, tangled in the noise. A *thousand voices* are clawing at my skull, the rancid stench of death curling in my nostrils, choking me. It's strange how the mind works, isn't it? That clarity can come right when you’re on the edge of ripping your own skin off, just to stop *feeling* it. This isn’t just something hunting me from the outside, no—it’s *inside* me. It *is* me. And that’s the part I can’t untangle.

How do I even begin to explain what it feels like to fall apart like this? To feel your mind unraveling, thread by fragile thread, like someone’s yanking on a loose seam, pulling your thoughts apart with every breath you take. Each whisper—a small, snapping thread in a tapestry of madness. But you need to hear it, don’t you? Someone has to know.

It started, I think, with the fog.

We drove up that mountain in near silence, with only the occasional forced conversation peppered through the air like a bad joke that nobody really wanted to laugh at. You know that kind of talk. The type people force when they’re too afraid to even acknowledge what’s crawling under their skin—fear that’s still small enough to hide behind tight smiles and hollow laughs.

Danica, though? She was buried in her notes, scribbling like a madwoman, muttering under her breath like she was in a trance. Rehearsing. Prepping for her grand vision of the “documentary” she had us all sucked into. That’s what she does—flits between being perfectly in control and on the verge of *snapping*. It’s magnetic, in a terrifying way. That same force that pulled me into her orbit now felt more like a noose tightening with every mile we climbed into those mist-drenched mountains.

Nathan, though, he felt it. He kept glancing back, eyes wide and glassy, like he was waiting for me to say something. To give him an out. But I didn’t. And no one else did either. Not a single one of us could say what we were thinking: that we were afraid of something we couldn’t even put a name to.

Then we reached it. *The town*.

It didn’t have a name anymore, not that we knew of. Maybe once it had been a place people spoke about, a dot on some forgotten map, a whisper of a memory in a history book no one reads. Now, though, it was nothing more than a graveyard of rotting houses, crumbling under the weight of fog that clung like a wet, heavy thing, suffocating. The air was thick with the scent of decay—wood, dirt, and something *else*, something foul that clawed its way into your throat.

And God, the silence. It was too much. No birds, no wind. Just... *nothing*. Except there *was* something. A whisper. Faint, far-off, but there, threading its way through the quiet. I couldn’t make out the words. Maybe that’s why it was so terrifying.

Danica, predictably, was the first to break the silence. “This is perfect,” she breathed, eyes wide with a sick kind of excitement. It made me want to vomit. But I didn’t say anything. I just watched as she pulled out her camera, her eyes gleaming with that twisted ambition. I wanted to scream at her. But I didn’t. I couldn’t. Instead, I stayed quiet and followed as she filmed the ghost of a place.

That’s when I saw him.

An old man, standing in the doorway of one of the houses, hidden just enough in the shadows that I almost didn’t catch him at first. His skin was stretched too tight, pale as paper, and his eyes... they were empty. Hollow. He just *stared*.

“Hello there!” Danica called out, way too bright, like she was trying to shatter the tension with fake cheer. “We’re filmmakers. Do you have a moment?”

The man didn’t move. He didn’t blink. Just stepped back into the darkness without a word.

We should have left. Nathan’s eyes met mine, wide and pleading, but I said nothing. And deeper we went. Into the mist. Into the nightmare.

That night, the whispers started.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was just the wind. A trick of the mountains. But then they grew louder. More insistent. I lay there in my sleeping bag, frozen, staring into the dark, listening.

Until I heard my name.

“Alex...”

I shot upright, heart pounding, but Nathan was still sound asleep. Danica’s tent was silent. I tried to tell myself I was imagining things, but I knew. I’d heard it.

And the next day? Things got worse. The locals—the ones who hadn’t vanished into the fog—were strange. Hollow, like the old man. They spoke, but their words were dead. Rehearsed. And there were warnings. Quiet mutters about leaving. Before *it* finds you.

Then Nathan vanished. No word. No warning. Just... gone.

When we found him, he was strung up between two trees, his skin peeled back in delicate strips, eyes wide open, like he was still trapped inside his own corpse.

Danica didn’t cry. Didn’t scream. She filmed.

And I? I stood there. Frozen.

The whispers? They were louder now. Relentless. Each night, they crept closer, coiling around my brain, prying at the edges of my sanity. I’d hear my name, clear as day, called out from somewhere just beyond the fog. “Alex…” Soft, teasing, like fingers running down my spine. I tried to ignore them. I tried to sleep. But it’s impossible to sleep when something is inside your head, gnawing at your thoughts like a hungry animal.

That’s when Danica changed.

It was subtle at first. A tension in her shoulders, a flicker of something dark behind her eyes. The camera—the damn camera—never left her side, like it was glued to her hand. She didn’t eat. She barely slept. Her obsession had always been there, simmering under the surface, but now? It consumed her. She spent hours standing at the edge of the trees, staring into the fog, muttering under her breath. I don’t know what she was saying. I didn’t want to know.

Then, one night, I woke up to the sound of her voice. “Alex...”

I bolted upright, heart hammering, but she was nowhere near me. No, she was standing at the edge of the clearing, her back to me, her camera dangling from one limp hand. The fog swirled around her feet, thick and sluggish, almost *alive*. I called her name, but she didn’t respond. She just stood there, whispering.

I stumbled out of the tent, my legs weak, my head spinning. “Danica?” My voice barely came out, trembling, broken. She didn’t move.

“Alex,” she said again, but her voice—it wasn’t coming from her. It was too close, too soft, like it was coming from *inside* my own head.

I approached her slowly, the damp earth squelching beneath my boots. She didn’t turn around. Her body was unnaturally still, stiff, like a mannequin propped up in some twisted display.

“Come with me,” she whispered, her voice low and distant, as if it were being dragged from some far-off place. “You need to see.”

Her head turned toward me, slowly, too slowly, and when I saw her face, my blood ran cold.

It wasn’t her.

Her eyes—they were too wide, too glassy, like they didn’t belong to her anymore. Her skin seemed too tight, stretched thin over her bones, pulling her mouth into a grotesque, forced smile. And then she turned, without another word, and began walking into the trees.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to run. But something pulled me forward. Some invisible thread yanked me along after her, one step at a time, deeper into the fog. My body moved on its own, my legs heavy, numb, like I was walking underwater.

The forest closed in around us. The branches overhead twisted together, trapping us in a cage of wood and fog. The air was thick with it—so thick I could hardly breathe, each step pulling me deeper into some unseen horror.

Danica stopped in front of an ancient tree, its bark blackened and cracked, the branches above like skeletal arms reaching into the dark sky. She didn’t move. Didn’t blink. She just stared.

And then she began to peel.

Her fingers dug into her own face, nails sinking into her flesh, and she pulled. The skin came away easily—*too* easily—as if it had never really been hers. No scream, no sound, just the wet, sickening noise of skin tearing from muscle.

I wanted to run, to turn away, but my feet were glued to the ground. My breath came in shallow, ragged gasps as I watched her strip herself down, revealing the raw, glistening muscle beneath, her eyes still wide, still empty.

Then she turned toward me, her skinless face gleaming in the moonlight, and smiled that same twisted, unnatural smile.

“Come closer,” she whispered, her voice too sweet, too soft, as though she were offering me a gift. “I want to show you something.”

I tried to shake my head, to back away, but my body wouldn’t listen. I was trapped in place, rooted to the spot by the sheer, suffocating terror of it all.

And then she lunged.

I threw myself backward, barely escaping her grasp, scrambling on all fours as she advanced, her fingers slick with blood, her muscles twitching beneath the exposed bone. She smiled wider, that same grotesque, carved smile, and as she did, she began to strip the rest of her skin away.

The sound was worse this time—wet and heavy, like fabric being torn, but thicker, more final. The skin peeled away in long, sticky strips, revealing more of the raw, red muscle beneath, the veins pulsing and writhing like they were alive. Blood dripped onto the ground, pooling around her feet, but she didn’t stop. She didn’t falter.

And then she reached for me again.

“Don’t you want to see?” she whispered, her voice lilting, teasing, as though this were all a game to her. “Don’t you want to understand?”

I stumbled to my feet, legs shaking, heart pounding in my chest. I ran. I ran harder than I’ve ever run before, the fog closing in around me, thick and suffocating, the sound of her voice still echoing in my ears. “Alex…” she called, her voice almost playful. “Come back. Come *see*.”

The whispers followed me. They were everywhere now, not just in my head, but in the air, crawling under my skin, slithering through my thoughts. I couldn’t shake them. They were part of me now.

I collapsed against a tree, gasping for air, my lungs burning, my mind spinning. The fog pressed in tighter, thicker, like it was trying to suffocate me. And then, through the haze, I saw it.

It wasn’t Danica. Not anymore.

At first, it was just a shape, barely visible through the fog. Tall, too tall, its limbs long and thin, twisted at unnatural angles. It moved toward me, slowly, deliberately, each step a slow, deliberate twist of the knife.

As it got closer, I could see it more clearly. The skin it wore—it wasn’t its own. It had been taken, piece by piece, stitched together into a grotesque patchwork of flesh. And there, stitched into its face, were Danica’s eyes. Nathan’s mouth. And a dozen others, faces I didn’t recognize, all trapped in this horrible patchwork of flesh, melded together into one impossible, nightmarish form.

It stepped closer, and the air around it seemed to pulse, thick with the weight of the stolen skins it wore. I could hear them now—the voices of those it had taken, those it had consumed, their words twisted and warped, layered one over the other in a chorus of terror.

“Alex…” it hissed, its voice a sickening blend of all their voices, a cacophony of pain and fear. “Come closer. Let me wear you.”

I couldn’t move. My body was frozen, locked in place by some unseen force. My mind was screaming at me to run, to fight, to *do something*, but I just stood there, trembling, as the thing came closer. Closer. Each step slow, deliberate, as though it had all the time in the world to savor this moment.

It stretched out one long, skeletal hand, the fingers too thin, too long, tipped with sharp, jagged nails that caught the moonlight. The skin it wore shifted and rippled with its movement, like it wasn’t quite attached, like it could slide off at any moment. And that horrible, patchwork face—it was still smiling. Always smiling.

“Alex…” it whispered again, dragging out my name in a sick, distorted mockery of the voices I knew. “Come closer. Let me wear you.”

I felt something cold and wet brush against my skin, and the instant it touched me, I knew. This thing didn’t want to kill me. No, that would have been merciful. It wanted to *take me*. To strip me down, to peel away my skin, layer by layer, until there was nothing left but raw, exposed muscle. It wanted to wear me, like it had worn all the others.

And that was when I felt it—the shift. Something deep inside me, something dark and primal, something that had been lurking in the shadows of my mind ever since we arrived in this cursed place. The whispers—they weren’t just in the air anymore. They were *inside me*. Twisting, coiling, wrapping around my thoughts like a vine, tightening, squeezing.

“You were always part of this,” the voices whispered, threading through my mind, blending with my own thoughts until I couldn’t tell where they ended and I began. “You can’t escape. You were never meant to escape.”

The thing’s hand pressed harder against my skin, and for a moment, I felt the sharp, cold edge of its nails dig in, like it was testing, waiting for the moment it could begin peeling me apart. But as its fingers sank into my flesh, something inside me snapped. The fear, the panic—it evaporated in an instant, replaced by something else. Something darker. Something I hadn’t even realized was there.

I wasn’t afraid anymore.

I reached up, grabbing the thing’s wrist in both of my hands, my grip so tight my knuckles turned white. Its skin felt wrong—too soft, too wet, like it was barely holding together. I could feel it shifting beneath my fingers, slipping over the bone like it was *alive*.

And then, in one swift motion, I *pulled*.

The skin tore away with a wet, sickening rip, and the thing let out a low, rasping hiss that sounded like a dozen voices gasping all at once. I stumbled backward, clutching the patch of stolen skin in my hand, the thing’s empty, hollow face staring at me, the mouths stitched into its flesh opening and closing in silent screams.

It didn’t bleed. It didn’t flinch. It just stood there, watching me with those stolen eyes, its fingers twitching at its sides, like it was deciding whether to lash out or retreat.

And then, with a slow, deliberate motion, it peeled away the rest of its face.

I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. The skin slid off like a mask, revealing the raw, exposed muscle beneath, the veins throbbing and twitching in the cool night air. The faces of the people it had taken—Danica, Nathan, all the others—they were still there, hanging loosely from its body, their eyes wide and staring, their mouths moving soundlessly.

It smiled again, a grotesque, skinless grin, and took a step toward me.

I didn’t wait. I ran.

The fog swallowed me whole as I bolted through the trees, branches whipping at my face, the ground slick and wet beneath my feet. I could hear the thing behind me, moving through the mist like it was part of it, its footsteps slow and steady, deliberate. It didn’t need to hurry. It knew I couldn’t outrun it forever.

The whispers were everywhere now, louder than ever, echoing through the fog, through the trees, through my own thoughts. They weren’t just calling my name anymore—they were laughing. Taunting.

“You can’t run, Alex. You were always part of this. You’ve always been part of this.”

My breath came in short, ragged gasps, my lungs burning with every step, but I couldn’t stop. I *wouldn’t* stop. I had to get away. I had to find some way—*any* way—to escape.

But deep down, I knew. I knew there was no escaping this. Not really. The whispers had told me as much. This wasn’t just some nightmare I could wake up from. This was something deeper. Something older. Something that had been waiting for me all along.

I tripped, my foot catching on a root, and I went down hard, the wind knocked out of me as I hit the ground. The world spun, the fog swirling around me, thick and suffocating, pressing in on all sides.

And then I saw it.

It was standing over me, its hollow, patchwork face gazing down at me with those dead, stolen eyes. It tilted its head to one side, almost curious, like it was studying me, deciding how best to take me apart.

I tried to crawl away, but my body wouldn’t listen. My limbs felt heavy, numb, like they weren’t even mine anymore. The fog was inside me now, crawling through my veins, filling my lungs, my mind.

The thing crouched down beside me, its long, skeletal fingers brushing against my cheek. Its touch was cold, wet, and it sent a shiver down my spine, freezing me in place.

“Don’t fight it,” it whispered, its voice a sickening blend of all the voices it had taken, layered one over the other like a chorus of despair. “It’s easier if you don’t fight.”

I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to block it out, trying to silence the voices, but they wouldn’t stop. They wouldn’t *stop*.

“You were always part of this,” the thing whispered, its fingers trailing down my neck, its skinless face inches from mine. “You’ve always been part of this.”

I felt its fingers press harder, sinking into my skin, and I knew. I knew what was coming next.

I was going to be part of it.

I was going to be worn.

I don’t know how long it’s been since then. Time doesn’t make sense here, in the fog, in the dark. It all blurs together, one endless, suffocating moment of pain and silence and *feeling*. God, the *feeling*. I can still feel my skin, still feel the touch of its fingers as it stripped me down, inch by inch, layer by layer.

I’m still alive. I think. I can feel the others, too—the ones who came before me, the ones it took. They’re all here, their voices mingling with mine, their thoughts tangled with mine, a constant, never-ending chorus in the back of my mind.

We’re all part of it now.

We’re all *one*.

And we’re waiting.

Waiting for the next ones to come. Waiting for the next faces, the next skins, the next voices to be added to the collection.

Because the cycle never ends.

It never ends.
