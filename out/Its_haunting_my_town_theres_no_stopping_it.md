Earlier I was on my way home from a long day at work, It was the summer season but it was oddly cold out. I live in a very rural area of Massachusetts, and the nearest house is a few miles away. As I drove down a deserted road, my car slowed to a stop.


“Shit. Should have gotten gas” I said as I fumbled around searching through my purse for my phone.
I couldn’t find it anywhere. I looked in the glove compartment and in the backseat with my sweater. It was nowhere. I sighed and looked around for my car keys hoping I could atleast lock the car doors and walk up the road to my friends house to use there phone but I couldn’t find my keys either.. I thought this was strange as I’m the type of person to never forget or lose things.
I whipped around and tried to open the car door, they were locked.
“So I’m stuck in here…” I said annoyed.
I thought I could just wait for a car to drive down the road and flag them down. Thought that would be a bit futile tho.
My feet were killing me from these gaudy heels I wore to work today so I took them off a slipped into an extra pair of sneakers.
I soon realized my keys feel into the crack between the seats of the passenger and driver.
I groaned and stuck my hand, which is very skinny down the crack and was able to reach them and pull them out. I unlocked the car door and tried making sure the car didn’t just break down, The car quickly turned on, The engine however spluttered. As I opened the window for fresh air I dropped my keys out of the car.
My phone started ringing so I was able to find it, strangely it was in a coat pocket that I hadn’t worn today..
I thought I was going crazy


I answered the phone without looking who it was assuming it was my friend asking where I was.


“Hello?” I said


“You looking for these?” The voice said.


“Who is this-?” I asked confused.


“Might wanna get your car keys.” The voice replied in a snarly voice.


My face froze and I turned white.


“How do you know where I am?” I said shaking.



“I never said I did” the voice said.

I quickly opened the door to pick the keys up off the ground only for them to be gone. I quickly tried driving off but without the keys the car was going nowhere.


“Who are you?” I said as the car finally died.
I was beyond nervous now.


“You might wanna look up.” The voice said.
I was too afraid to, but when I did all I saw a ghastly figure, contorted fingers, a hunchback, drenched in blood, wielding a knife, It’s eyes bloodshot red, like a demented demon from hell. It’s voice soon changed and it quickly became a growl, like nails scratching on a chalkboard. It dangled my car keys like it was playing a game of house.

This.. thing.. began to speak.
“This will only hurt a bit.” It said as it charged at me as I screamed. I woke up the next morning in my car with a note.
It read “Next time I’ll take your soul” and I lift up my shirt to find out one of my livers were gone. The note was signed “Your secret admirer” and a bloody heart was drawn on the paper. I will never drive down that road ever again, this was a warning. I told my friend and they experienced the exact same thing aswell and nobody believed her. It took her liver too. Her note read
“Stay away from my love!”
We decided to keep this all a secret until later that night, it happened again.
