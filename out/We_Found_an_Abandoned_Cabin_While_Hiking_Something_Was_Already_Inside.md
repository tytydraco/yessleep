I don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe it’s just to get it out of my head.

It was supposed to be a weekend trip—me, my cousin Mark, and his girlfriend Sarah. Three days, two nights, nothing hardcore. Just a remote trail through a state forest no one ever talks about. The kind of place that doesn’t show up on official maps anymore. Mark had read about it on some off-the-grid hiking forum. Said it used to be a fire watch zone before funding dried up and the rangers pulled out.

It started normal. Quiet trail. Crisp air. We were five miles in before we realized how quiet it really was. No birds. No bugs. Just the crunch of leaves underfoot and that kind of silence that pushes against your ears.

We found the cabin near sunset.

It wasn’t on the map. It wasn’t even off the trail—it was just… there. Like it had grown out of the earth when we weren’t looking. It looked ancient. Half-sunken into the slope. Weather-beaten wood. A rusted chimney tilting at a weird angle. No signs of life, no trails leading to or from it. Just moss, rot, and silence.

Mark wanted to check it out. Sarah didn’t.

We argued about it for maybe ten minutes. The sun was dipping fast, and the tree cover made it even darker. We hadn’t seen anyone else all day, and the nearest campsite was two miles back. So we went inside.

The air was cold. Stale. Not just old-dust stale—wrong stale. Like something had been exhaling in that room for a long time and only just stopped.

There were signs people had lived there—faded family photos nailed to the walls, a toppled bookshelf, the rotted remains of a cot. But it was the carvings that stopped us.

Not just on the walls. On the floor. The ceiling. Even the inside of the windows, where the light barely touched. Spirals, tally marks, symbols that made your eyes feel blurry if you looked too long. Carved deep, with something sharp and impatient.

Mark laughed it off. Said it was probably some backwoods cult crap.

Sarah wanted to leave.

And I—I didn’t know what I wanted. But I couldn’t shake the feeling that the cabin wasn’t abandoned.

Not really.

We stayed the night. We didn’t mean to—it just got dark too fast.

We set up our sleeping bags near the door, kept a fire going in the crumbling hearth, and tried not to look at the walls.

At around 2 a.m., I woke up.

The fire was out. The door was wide open.

And Sarah was gone.

I shot up, calling her name. Mark scrambled awake behind me, already pulling on his boots. We ran outside into the trees, flashlights cutting through the mist. Everything looked wrong. The forest didn’t feel like the same place we’d hiked through. The trees were too close. The ground was too soft. Like we were walking on a sponge that breathed when we stepped on it.

Then we heard her scream.

It wasn’t far—but it wasn’t right either. The sound wasn’t coming from her throat. It was coming from all around us.

And it was still going, long past what a person could scream.

We found her backpack half-buried in the leaves, torn open. Her phone was still inside, screen cracked. Still recording.

We played it back later. Just audio. Muffled breathing. Footsteps. Then a voice—Sarah’s, whispering something over and over again.

“It’s not her. It’s not me. Don’t look. Don’t look. Don’t—”

The clip ended in a wet, crunching noise.

We went back to the cabin.

We didn’t talk. We just needed to be somewhere with walls. With corners. Somewhere that felt human. But it didn’t feel safe anymore. The carvings had changed.

They were deeper.

Wetter.

And now, there were footprints in the dust. Not bare feet. Not shoes.

Something wrong. Long. Split-toed. Like a deer—if a deer walked upright and dragged one foot behind it.

We didn’t sleep.

Not after we heard the knock.

Three slow taps against the cabin wall, just outside the window.

Then a voice.

Not Sarah’s.

But it wore her words.

“Let me in. I’m cold.”

Mark opened the door.

I didn’t think he would.

Didn’t think anyone would after hearing what we did.

But maybe that’s the thing—when someone you love is in danger, logic doesn’t matter. You’ll do anything to believe they’re still alive.

He looked at me once before he did it.

Didn’t say a word.

Just that look—half panic, half guilt—and then he unlatched the door and pulled it open.

There was no one there.

Just fog.

Thick, colorless fog that crawled along the ground and pressed inward like a living thing.

But the voice came again—clearer this time. Right next to the door.

“Mark,” it said, in her voice. “It’s me.”

He stepped outside.

I tried to stop him. I really did.

But my body wouldn’t move. Something about the fog pressed against my chest, made my lungs feel thin. The carvings on the walls throbbed faintly, like they were breathing. Whispering. Feeding.

I stumbled to the door, leaned out into the fog.

The trees looked wrong.

Taller than before. Twisting up into the dark like they were trying to escape whatever was down here. No wind. No birds. Just the sound of Mark’s footsteps crunching the moss.

“Sarah?” he called.

And then he stopped.

Completely still.

I saw her—or what was wearing her skin—step out from behind a tree.

It looked like her. Same face. Same jacket. Same wild brown hair.

But her legs were backwards.

Not broken. Not bent. Backwards.

And she was smiling way too wide.

Mark took a shaky step back. “What… what happened to you?”

She didn’t answer.

Instead, she bent at the knees—wrong, disjointed like a marionette with cut strings—and let out this wet, choking clicking sound from the back of her throat. Like she was trying to speak, but couldn’t remember how.

Then she looked at me.

Right past Mark.

Her eyes didn’t blink. They didn’t move. Just locked on and stayed there.

Then she whispered, “One of you let me in.”

Behind me, something scratched along the cabin wall.

Then the opposite wall.

Then the roof.

I spun around, heart trying to punch through my ribs, and slammed the door shut.

But it was too late.

Mark wasn’t outside anymore.

He was inside.

He stood in the center of the room, breathing heavy, staring at the door like he didn’t remember opening it.

His hands were shaking. His eyes were glassy.

“Mark?” I said.

He didn’t respond.

Then I saw his neck twitch—like something was moving just beneath the skin.

A ripple.

Then another.

And then he smiled.

Not his smile.

Her smile.

“I told you,” he said.

“One of you let me in.”

I bolted.

Didn’t wait for an explanation. Didn’t give Mark—or whatever was wearing him—a chance to speak again.

I ran to the corner of the cabin and yanked down the attic ladder.

It dropped with a groan loud enough to make my teeth hurt.

The air up there was thicker. Warmer. It smelled like dust, mold, and old breath. Like something had been waiting in the dark for a long, long time. But it was the only place left.

I scrambled up, pulled the ladder back in behind me, and pressed myself against the far wall, flashlight gripped tight enough to crack the casing.

Below me, the cabin creaked.

Mark’s footsteps—slow and dragging—moved across the floorboards.

Then silence.

But not real silence.

I could hear him breathing. Right under the hatch.

And then scratching. Just the softest bit—like fingernails tapping the wood.

He whispered, “You already let me in.”

I didn’t answer. Didn’t move. I just shut off my light and curled against the wall like I was trying to disappear into it.

Eventually, even the scratching stopped.

I don’t know how long I’ve been up here.

My phone’s dead. The light only works if I shake it. There’s no signal—of course there isn’t—and I haven’t heard the birds come back.

Sometimes, at night, I hear footsteps moving in the woods outside.

Sometimes I hear Mark calling my name, or Sarah crying.

But it’s never them.

And last night…

last night I heard a second voice up here with me.

It whispered from the corner I’ve been too scared to check.

Said it had always been in the walls. Said it’s hungry.

I don’t know how much longer I have.

But I don’t think they ever really left the cabin.

I think the cabin is them.

And now that I’ve seen them,

they’re just waiting for me to open the door again.
