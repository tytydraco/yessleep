Chapter 1

I walked to the Universal Coney Island. It was just a few blocks away from my apartment complex. My neck was still damp from the cool shower. In my eagerness to see Marie, I had thrown on a pair of black jeans and a black button up. I was also wearing the leather jacket she had given me as a gift. I was supposed to meet her for coffee, and then we had to conduct some business on behalf of her family at a local nightclub. 

It was not unusual for Marie to be late. I thought of what she could possibly be doing and almost decided against leaving a voice message: 

“Hey, Marie, it’s William. Called you. Anyway, I’m at the place I thought I finally convinced you to try. Guess I was wrong. Return my call when you get this message.” 

I opened the glass door leading into the vestibule and saw a young girl waiting by the counter. We exchanged glances. That was all it took for my primitive side to take over... my vampire side.

Her perfume was intoxicating. The faint aroma of jasmine and wildflower made my fangs stiff. 

She turned around once she had noticed my shadow and asked, “Do I know you from somewhere?” 

“Do I seem familiar?”

“No. Can you please—"

“Did I startle you.” 

“You didn’t.”

“Even better.”

“Excuse me?”

“I couldn’t stop myself... from talking to you, of course.”

She scanned my eyes for deception. “Well, if you want to get to know me, you could start by buying me something to eat.” 

“Whatever you desire.” 

“Whatever I desire, huh?” 

I waved my hand towards the counter, and added, “I’d be a fool not to.”

“I like the way you put it,” she smiled, placing a finger to her lips as she thought about my offer. “Hmm. Well, can I have—wait, let me think. Okay, an order of nachos and a milkshake, I suppose.”

The Arabian guy behind the counter asked, “Is that it?”

“Wait. Do you want something?” she asked me.

“Medium, double-double.” 

She clasped my hand when it reached her waist and gently tugged it away. When she looked up at me, her look was one of surprise. My boldness was her curiosity, and so she softly spoke, “You haven’t even told me your name.”

“Are names really important?”

“You can’t be serious.” 

“William, what’s yours?”

“Juliet,” she smirked back.

“It suits you,” I kindly told her. 

“Thank you for the compliment.” 

“Okay. You guys can have a seat. The waitress will bring your food to you when it’s done,” the Arabian guy insisted.

Juliet was wearing a scarlet gown that had a pleated waistline. My primitive side wanted nothing more than to ravage her in that vacant restaurant. I wanted to give in to my nature so bad but... *No! Not here. Not now.* 

She turned to me and smiled. I had been in my feelings for so long. I hadn’t even noticed that she had left my presence and took a seat at the table nearest the exit. I wonder how long she had been watching me review her with my eyes. Meh. What does it matter? She’ll be dead soon...

Juliet took a seat upon the opposite side. And when I sat down across from her, she said, “A menu, waiter, couches. What kind of Coney Island is this?”

“It’s more like a restaurant, you like it?” 

“It’s homey. Look at all the silly pictures!” 

“You’re right. It is very homely.” 

“What’s your name? I didn’t catch it the first time.”

“William. William Chosen.” 

“What is that Italian, or wait, Greek maybe? Well, anyways, my name is Juliet Lansing. Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.”

“Bond?”

“Yeah. ‘Mr. William. William Chosen.’”

“Why would you—"

“I’m just teasing.”

“Interesting. I guess.”

“Strange last name by the way.”

“If you only knew.”

“Why? What’s so funny?”

“Nothing. Nothing at all.”

“Pfft. The name fits.”

The reason why I was smirking was because I knew the origin of my last name. It was just that I couldn’t tell her that it was the surname given to a vampire of pureblood decent. I wouldn’t tell her in a million years something that sounded so outlandish. And besides, I had other plans for her.

“You know, you’ve been grinning ever since we sat down.” 

“It’s nothing really. I’m curious, where are you coming from dressed like that this time of the night?”

“It’s not even late. Anyways? To answer your question. I went over to Wayne State and turned in my application for next semester. Then I talked to one of the guidance counselors about financial aid. After that I stayed at the library until closing. Had to brush up on my history and stuff since that is what I’m going to be majoring in, well, African and Native American studies, actually.”

“How old are you, Juliet?” 

“Eighteen, and you?” 

“Twenty-two.”

“Let me see your license.”

“You don’t believe me?” 

“I just want to see it.” 

“I don’t have it.”

She glanced at my Rolex. “That’s odd?” 

I smirked. “No it’s not.” 

“Well. You shouldn’t walk around the city without an ID. It isn’t safe. Or smart. Something bad could happen to you.” 

“It’s funny you say that...” I murmured as I looked down at the carpeted floor. Magically, the colorful patterns had become interesting. Maybe not. Maybe it was the sudden guilt and shame that consumed me. At that moment I knew I wasn’t going to slay her. I wanted something more, but what that was I didn’t know. Something about her reminded me of my last victim, Lisa.

*Why did I kill her? Why?!*

“Are you okay, you look upset?”

I slid my hands through my hair. “Long story.”

“What do you want from me?”

“It’s funny you ask.” 

“Why is it funny.”

“You’d never guess.”

“Well, the answer’s no. I’m not going back to your place, so don’t even bother asking.”

“Why? Are you afraid?”

“I’m looking for something long term.” 

“You get asked quite frequently I assume?” 

She huffed. “Yeah. I’m getting tired of saying the same thing over and over. Why can’t the guy I’m looking for just—” 

“Okay, so which one of you folks had the coffee?” the waitress asked, breaking Juliet’s train of thought.

“I had the coffee, she has the other stuff,” I told her.

“Darn, I probably should’ve ordered more since he’s buying,” she jokingly shared with the waitress. 

She smiled while placing her food upon the table. “Here you go, sugar, take care of yourself.”

“You should probably just pour the salsa over your nachos.”

“Is that the logical thing to do?” she asked me.

“Yeah. It is.”

“Then too bad,” she said before dipping a chip into the container. “Maybe I’ll change my mind if you answer my question.”

“What was your question?”

“You know.” 

“I don’t.”

“What do you want?”

“Well, I wouldn’t mind taking you back to my apartment but—” 

“I already told you no?”

“Right…”

“So… do you have a car?” she inquired.

I stole a sip from my mug. “Yes.”

“Interesting, where do you work?”

“I do a lot of things here and there.”

“Things? Huh.”

“Yeah… things…”

“Like what.”

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“A lot of things.”

“Oh my God.”

“I know I’m being vague. But in my line of work, you have to be.”

“Oh yeah? Why’s that.”

“You can’t let people get too close.”

Juliet frowned. “Whatever. You’re probably a fraud.”

“Believe what you desire.”

“Look, I’m sorry. It’s late. I-I have to go.”

I grabbed her hand when she stood. “I want to see you again?”

“I don’t know you’re kinda creepy?”

“How so?”

“With most guys I can tell what they’re after, but with you it’s different. It’s like I know but I don’t.” 

“Here, I’ll give you my number. You can decide from there,” I said before jotting it down upon the nearest napkin. 

“Okay. I *might* call you.”

“Wait, will you be okay getting home?” 

“I’ll be just fine. Thanks for the food.”

She said goodbye, leaving me here to reflect upon my inaction. After letting out a deep sigh, I mumbled, “Why did I let her escape?” 

Disappointed in myself, I looked at my Rolex to see it was only 8:00 pm. “It’s getting late, huh,” I mumbled her excuse aloud just to see if it didn’t sound as ridiculous if I said it. Maybe shame was a good feeling. Maybe it was the thing I deserved for what I did to Lisa’s beautiful soul. I brought my hands to my face and relived the moment I sunk my fangs into her neck. 

“Come on, William, snap out of it. What would Marie say if she walked in and saw you like this?” 

“Need a refill, honey?”

“Um, no thanks.”

“Everything alright? You look a bit flustered.”

“I’ll figure it out.” 

“Suit yourself.” 

The waitress grabbed my empty mug. She looked to be about forty but hid her age well with makeup and decorum. Her apron was soiled in old food and coffee stains. She didn’t look too bad from the back, but was she good enough to *kill* was the question? Let’s see. I could wait for her to leave work, which should probably be very soon by the looks of it. Yeah. That’s it. I could easily follow her home and impale my fangs deep inside her neck. I wonder how good her blood tastes. I’ve never been with an older... eh… What was I thinking? Liten to me, rambling about like some desperate thief in the night without a light. Who’s next on my bucket list? The kind old granny at my apartment complex?

I slammed the money on the table and barged out the door. Oh, and just for my rapacious stupidity, I made sure to leave a forty-dollar tip for the hardworking waitress I fancied murdering. 

The cool, night air hit my face and flowed down my body. The relaxing sensation almost pulled me out of my warped frame of mind. I reached into my pocket for a cigarette. In the city I felt free. It’s funny. This abandoned street reminded me so much of my abandoned dreams.
