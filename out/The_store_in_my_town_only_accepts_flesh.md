Growing up, my mom taught me to hunt. Deer, rabbit, skunk, possum, squirrel. Didn’t matter what. Every day, or near enough, we’d be prowling with a rifle, checking and resetting traps, some of which hadn’t been legal in decades. Anything we killed, we’d field dress and haul home. I was six when I first pulled the intestines from a pheasant and eight when I slit a dying deer’s throat for the first time. 

We never ate any of the meat. We’d bring it home and cut it up and then mom would wrap it in wax paper and stick in in a freezer. We had four of them in the house. A modern fridge-freezer combo in the kitchen that took up almost a whole wall of the poky space. Then there was a chest in the main room next to the couch. Finally, we had two more freezers in the basement, big blue things that looked like they were from the ‘50s and hummed so loud you could hear it throughout the house. All of them were packed full. 

Once a week, mom would go shopping. I was fifteen before she let me come with her. We packed what must have been near 200lbs into mom's truck, hauling it in plastic boxes stained pink from years of meat juice. It was midnight when we set out, the clear sky rent by crescent moon and peppered with stars. I leaned my head out the window to feel the wind, and escape the smell of meat. Mom lit two cigarettes and passed me one. I took a long drag, thankful for something else to mask the scent.

“When we get there, I don’t want hear nothing from you ‘sides ‘yes, sir’, ‘no, sir’ and ‘three bags full, sir’.” Mom said, cigarette dangling from her mouth. I nodded, knowing better than to ask questions. 

We lived on the outskirts of town, on the edge of Sawtooth woods, not to be confused with the national forest, and it was about an hour to the nearest box store. We’d go there for clothes, items to repair the house, ammunition. But not groceries. I’d picked up a box of milk duds when I was five and mom had spanked me so hard the ride home had me crying. I was interested to see where our food came from. We drove by several mom & pop places, dark and shuttered for the night, with mom showing no signs of slowing. 

Eventually, she turned into a residential neighborhood. It was clearly the wealthy part of town, all the homes had big yards and multiple floors. Mom was leaning forward, nose against the windscreen muttering to herself.

“Where is it, where is it? Always miss the dang turn.” She hit the brakes and the car screeched a protest. “There.” She turned down a narrow path that didn’t look like it was designed for cars. A sign at the beginning declared ‘private property no thru road’. We continued down, past the houses on either side and their considerable back yards before the narrow path opened into a parking lot.

It wasn’t giant, just eight or ten spaces, but it wasn’t what I’d imagined would be at the end. Streetlights flanked the lot, basking it in an amber glow and there, at the other end, was the store. Spotlights lit a sign that proclaimed the place to be called ‘Big Mal's'. Large windows showed an interior with narrow aisles packed floor to ceiling with goods while the door had been propped open with a cinder block. 

Mom pulled into a spot next to the only other car in the lot, a banged up off-roader with mismatched colourings. She killed the engine and turned to face me with that look that froze my guts. 

“Stay here until I come get you.” She stubbed out her cigarette, the forth during the trip, and stepped out, heading inside. I sat back and tried to relax. My knee was jiggin' something awful and I kept glancing around. 

The streetlights did a good job of lighting the lot, but they were too bright. Your eyes couldn’t adjust to take it all in without losing the keenness needed for low-light areas. It was like a wall of shadows surrounded me as I sat alone in the truck. And in that darkness I felt eyes on me. I looked to the store but I couldn’t see my mom. 

My chest grew tight and my skin cold. I’ve been in the black hills at dusk with a mountain lion stalking me and it isn’t a shadow of the fear I felt in that lot. It was a physical thing pressing on me, commanding me to stay still; daring me to run. I gauged the distance to the store over and over again. 15 feet. 20 at most. I could be out the truck and there in a second. Movement barely seen in the wing mirror decided me. 

I swung the door open and lunged forward only for arms to grab me round the waist and diagonally across the body and pull me back. I yelled in terror and swiped behind me blindly, connecting with nothing. That’s when I realised the thing holding me in place was just my seatbelt. I fumbled to pop it loose before spilling out onto the asphalt gasping. 

“Evrythin' alright?” A deep voice rumbled from the darkness along from the store. A giant of a man emerged from the shadows and strode over to me, approaching with the assuredness of a hunter towards wounded prey. He knelt opposite me, eyes on mine. There was such a hunger in his eyes that I recoiled. Tried to recoil. The man’s hand was on my shoulder, nails digging painfully and preventing me from moving. He smiled at me and his teeth were wrong. Inhuman. Animal. 

His lips drew back and his jaw opened to a slathering mouth. Too large canines, and incisors the wrong shape. I clenched my jaw painfully, knowing I was going to die. All I could think was: wolf. He has wolf teeth. I closed my eyes and waited for the end. Hot breath brushed my throat and gave me goosebumps. 

“He's with me.” I choked tears of relief at my mom's commanding voice. The hand on my shoulder relaxed its grip and the man chuckled. I opened my eyes to see him smiling. 

“My mistake, Red.” The man said, rising. He offered me a hand up. I stared at it in confusion for a moment before using the truck to get back to my feet, a surge of pain in my injured shoulder. My mom stood in the doorway of the store, her gutting knife alive with the phosphorescence of the streetlamp. 

“Stall door just happened to jam, no doubt.” Mom said, taking measured steps towards the man. He kept his eyes trained on me a moment longer before stepping back so he could see us both. 

“I'll look into that as soon as we’re square here.” He said.

“You can look at it now. The boy will help me unload payment.” At this the man's easy smile fell, replaced with a scowl.

“Fine. Close the door when you’re done.” He stomped off into the store, leaving mom and me alone. She watched the door until he was lost from sight then took deep breaths before finally sheathing her knife. 

“What is he?” I asked, voice scarce above a whisper. 

“I told you to wait for me in the truck.” Was all I got by way of reply. She popped the trunk and heaved at container into my hands. “Stack ‘em just to the left of the door, next to the till.” She said before reaching to grab another one. I glanced at the storefront and then my mom. Unwilling to approach the place, the man but unable to refuse my mom’s order. 

My legs didn’t feel stable as I slowly made my way forward. The smell of raw meat after what had just happened made me gag and I had to breathe through my mouth. I hovered at the threshold, the amber light of the lot being overcome by the almost silver light that bathed the stores shelves. I took two large strides to the till and dropped the container before rushing out. Mom was still standing back by the truck, hands on a container but watching me. My pace slowed when I realised she was looking at me. She gave me an approving nod and picked up the container. 

Once it was all in, mom grabbed an empty stack of containers hidden behind the desk. 

“Fill it.” She said. “Anything we need, and add something for yourself too. Just make sure the lid closes properly.” Before I could ask her any follow-up questions, she’d grabbed a box and headed to the back of the store. I moved amongst the shelves grabbing the stuff we usually had in the cupboards and fridge. Milk, eggs, cereal, fruits, vegetables. The standard things. With my container nearly full, I spied a stack of yellow boxes on a low shelf. Milk duds. I smiled and tossed a couple boxes in before closing the container and lugging it back to the car. 

We packed up all the boxes and mom kicked the cinder block away so the door could slide closed. A bell jingled as it shut and I glanced back to see the man standing there inside, staring at us through the glass of the door. I hurried to the truck. 

Driving home my throat burned with the questions that wanted to pour out of me. But mom stayed silent, so I stayed silent. It wasn’t until we were parked up outside our house that she finally spoke. 

“We get our groceries from Mal and only Mal, hear?”

“And we pay him in meat?”

“Yes.”

“Why?” I immediately regretted asking. Mom's face went hard in that way it always did before a beating and she opened her mouth for the venom but then...she just stopped. She leaned back in her seat and let out a long sigh. 

“That’s the agreement your father made.” She was staring up at the roof, eyes wet with tears. The subject of my father had always been taboo. She had mentioned him only once before on my twelfth birthday. She told me he was a kind but stupid man who had left when I was a baby. He had gone to the store and not returned. 

Gone to the store and not returned. I felt sick. I thought he’d abandoned us. Years of resentment evaporated in an instant, replaced by loss. Had those teeth been the last thing my father had seen? Had that voice been the last he'd heard? I punched the dash in frustration. And again. And again. Mom didn’t say anything, just let me get it out. Then we unloaded the truck. 

“I said get yourself something.” Mom said, slamming a box of milk duds on the kitchen counter. “Not two somethings.” She slammed the other one next to it. 

“One’s for you.” I said. Her harsh expression shifted to something I hadn’t seen before.

“You’re a good kid. I love you.” She swallowed me in a giant hug and I felt like a tiny baby despite being bigger than her already. 

“I...I love you too, mom.” I choked. It was the first time she’d ever said she loved me. 


When she got sick she went downhill fast. Despite my pleas, she refused to see a doctor. Said they couldn’t help her. She just lay in bed, wasting away no matter how much I fed her. It was like working three jobs. I’d be up before dawn, clean her up and get her fed then go hunting. Come back, prep the meat, give her some pills she’d ordered online. Then it was off to work at the Walmart. Come home, clean her up again, make dinner and off to bed. And once a week, I went to buy groceries. 

I never asked the thing his name. Took to referring to him as Mal on account of the sign. I’d drop off the meat, fill up with supplies and head back. Mal would usually be stood around the store somewhere. He’d ask questions, seeming all polite, but there was a sneer to his face. Like he knew that I knew what had happened to my father. 

“She's sick, ain’t she?” Mal said on my forth solo trip. I dropped the container I was holding and stared him down. 

“None of your damn business.” I growled. Mal just laughed. 

“You say it’s none of my business, it’s none of my business.” He grabbed a paper and pretended to read, so I headed to grab another container. “But I could help her.” He put down the paper again and reached under the counter for a jar of pills. He gave them a rattle. The smug bastard had rehearsed this. 

“If you’re fucking with me-" I said, reaching for my gutting knife.

“Scout's honor.” He said holding up three fingers. I froze. Mom was going downhill fast and something about this thing told me he meant what he said. 

“How much?”

“One.”

“One what? One pound? One container? One deer?” 

“One finger.” He said and that smile spread across his face. That smile I saw in dark corners. The wolf smile. “You give me a finger and I’ll give you something to fix up your mamma.” I pulled my knife and strode toward him and I swear I saw him flinch. He tried to pretend he hadn’t, but I saw. I placed my left hand on his till, fingers splayed, and lowered the knife to my pinky. I lined the blade by my knuckle so I could slide between the proximal phalanx and the metacarpal. Then I looked him right in the eye as I slowly brought the blade down.

The metal was cold as it as it sliced my skin and I felt the hot blood well up and spill down my hand. That’s when Mal gently, effortlessly, pulled the knife away from me. 

“You’re a good boy.” He said in a tone I didn’t much like. He raised my wounded hand to his mouth and licked the blood. The tongue that lapped out was too long and thin to be human. He moaned with pleasure at the taste. I tried to pull away, but he seized my hand in both of his. 

“We made an agreement. You ain’t backing out now, are you?” He said, lips brushing against my finger as I spoke. I suppressed a shudder. He slid his mouth down around my pinky, tongue still caressing the wound. His jaw clamped down hard and my finger exploded in pain as a score of teeth pierced my flesh. I fell to the floor, hand gushing blood from where my finger used to be. 

“Clean yourself up.” Mal said, tossing me a rag. A line of blood slipped from his mouth down his chin. I staunched my wound. 

“We done?” 

“Oh, we done. For now.” Mal laughed and stalked off, licking the blood from his chin. It took a lot longer to unload the meat and do the shopping with my injury, but I got it done eventually. 

 I stopped by the ER on my way home to get the wound dealt with. It was easy enough to convince them it was a hunting incident. Mom was up when I got back, her nightgown sodden. 

“Where were you? What happened?” Mom asked, seeing my bandaged hand. I considered lying to her. 

“I got you something to help.” I said, deciding on sidestepping the issue. I fumbled the capsules out of my jacket pocket and held them up. 

“How much?” Mom asked. She leaned against the wall to support herself to the couch. 

“A finger.” I said, showing my now deprived left hand. 

“Oh my boy. My kind, stupid boy.” Mom started sobbing. Horrible, racking sobs that caused her ribs to protrude. “He’s got a taste for you now.”

The capsules helped almost immediately. But they don’t work for long. A tablet will get her through maybe two days; he’d given me enough for a month. A month of seeing my mom back to her old self. That month is nearly at an end. Mom doesn’t want me to buy another bottle. I don’t know I can face the alternative
