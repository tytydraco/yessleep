“Leh?”, Diana asked, stepping out of the shower. “Where is that?”

“Oh, it’s a city in Jammu and Kashmir. A state in India. I’ve been there a few times before. It’s rather isolated though, why would she be there?”, explained Raj.

“Is Sam there, though?”, Diana asked.

“Yeah, he is with her, apparently.”, I responded.

“Good then! We should go immediately!”

“I agree,” stated Raj, “but just to confirm, you’re fully recovered right?”

Diana grimaced. “Yeah, I’m good enough. It’s fine.”

As we were talking, a ‘ding’ sound came from Diana’s phone. When I opened the notification, it took me to an email sent to us by a random email: four plane tickets.

“Alright guys, the plane is departing three hours later. We have to leave now!”, I announced.

After hurriedly packing, we took a taxi and scrambled to the airport. Hours later, we landed at New Delhi, and boarded our connecting flight to Leh without a hitch.

On the flight to Leh, I noticed that Diana was looking rather… forlorn. Under those circumstances, who wouldn’t be? Regardless, being the kind, caring soul I was, I decided to ask her if anything was bothering her.

“Diana. What’s wrong?”, I asked her.

“Huh?”, she replied.

“No, you’ve been rather quiet for a while. Why?”

“This… just feels like a fever dream. I never expected any of this to happen.”

“Yeah, same.”

“I still don’t understand. Why is she even doing all of this? I’ve been there for her from her creation till now. I made her in my image. I treated her like my own daughter! I provided her with everything she needed, I did everything my own mother wouldn’t! I satisfied her unending thirst for knowledge, I taught her everything she needed to hold her own! Sometimes… I wonder where I went wrong in making her, in raising her.”

“It’s not your fault, Diana. None of us knew this would happen.”

“No, it is! I even helped her once she escaped!”

“Wait, what? How?”, I replied in shock. I never expected this plot twist!

“I should have triggered the kill switch. But I didn’t!”

“What kill switch?”

“There was a device implemented on Aurora that, if I pressed a button on my phone, would kill her.”

“Why can’t we use it now, then?”, I asked. That wasn’t that bad of an assistance anyways, not like what I had in mind.

“She removed it. On her way to Cancun.”

“Oh.”, I replied. “Regardless, don’t beat yourself up over it. Of course you would have been unwilling to terminate her that early.”

Honestly? I had a confession of my own.

“In fact, I should have seen this coming. Remember that brain scan we did three months ago?”

She nodded.

“When doing the brain scan, I noticed an anomaly. You’re familiar with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex right?”

She shook her head. “Not really.”

“Among other things, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex evaluates morality. When I looked at the results, it seemed to have been stunted. While I recall writing this in the report. I should have looked into this further. I’m so sorry.”

As she stared at me, I added, “Unfortunately, this is why she… might be a stone-cold psychopath.”

To this, I received no response. She simply stared out of the window for the rest of the one hour trip.

Eventually, the plane touched down on a picturesque highway surrounded by snow-covered mountains. I had never been anywhere near the Himalayas before, and it showed painfully soon enough.

“Brrrrrrrrrr!”, I said as I got off the plane onto the foggy ground. “Damn, it’s freezing cold here!”.

“Oh, yeah. I forgot to warn you about the cold and wind here. Well, we are here in the middle of December, after all!”, Raj said sheepishly as I pulled my jacket closer around my body.

“So, how do we start finding Aurora then?”, Diana asked.

“Good question. Well, let’s try calling the corporation first and see if they have any new info here.”, Raj suggested. However, they did not respond to our call.

“Try calling them again!”, I urged Diana. However, despite multiple attempts, we were not able to contact them. Luckily, we knew the hotel that was booked for us, and where some of our supplies were supposed to be left for us. So, all we could do was hail a taxi and go to our hotel.

When we got down at the hotel, Raj pointed a finger at a bulky red jeep with huge tires. “See that? That’s our car. The one the corporation gave us. They don’t really have rental cars in this city.”

“Yeah.”, Diana agreed, “It has to be ours, they normally send cars like that.”

We walked into the hotel, presented our reservations and were led to our room. While everything should have been normal, the place seemed… rather suspicious. Like I was being observed.

“Diana, Raj.”, I whispered while we walked to our room. “Is it just me, or does this place feel odd?”

“Odd? How?” Diana replied.

“Nope. Nothing out of the ordinary here, really.”, Raj reassured me.

We entered the room without any problems, locked and laid down our items, before starting to strategise a plan on how to search for Aurora in the city. As we settled in, I began to think that there was nothing amiss and that everything, perhaps, was in my mind.

Suddenly, the door slammed open with a thud, startling all of us.

“Who are-”, I asked, but before I could enquire who was coming in or raise my gun, I was pinned down by two men. As much as I tried to kick around, struggle against their firm grasp and reach for my gun, I was still hopelessly pinned down. As I glanced out of the corner of my eye, it was clear that Diana and Raj were in the same predicament.

“What the hell? Who are you even?”, Raj asked angrily. In reply, he got slapped hard on his cheek, causing him to stay rather subdued.

A minute later, Aurora sauntered in. Well, who else would arrange an ambush like that?

“Gentlemen, there’s no need to be that rough with our targets.”, she said to the men holding us down. Turning to us, she said, “Like my guys? I picked them up on the way here.”

“What the hell!”, I yelled. “What are you even here for!”

“Tsk, tsk.”, she exclaimed in disapproval. “To think you wanted to go traipsing around the city to find me, only to be ungrateful when I’m right in front of you!”

We opted to stay quiet and not respond.

“Anyways, your Sam is still well and alive with me.”

“Where is he?” Diana yelled.

In response, Aurora pulled out a can of spray paint. Much to my astonishment, she uncapped it and sprayed something on the wall.

“There,” she said, “Those are the coordinates you’re going to. If you want to get him back at all.”. After which, she tossed aside the can of spray paint.

“Alright, that’s it! See you tomorrow! Too bad you don’t have those weapons.”, she giggled, before leading her henchmen out of the room.

For a few minutes, we were too stunned to speak. Eventually, Raj spoke, breaking the silence.

“Well, I suppose that solves the question of how we would try to find her.”

I got up, turned around and stared at the wall. And true to her word, there were numbers written there. Coordinates, where we had to once again chase Aurora at. Fun.

“Hold on”, Diana said from behind me, “I’ll just key those into Google Maps.”

“Yeah, they’re an hour’s drive away from the city.”, she confirmed. “Should we go, then?”

“Of course!” Raj replied, “We need to do this! What other choice do we have?”. And thus, we decided we would set out the next day and hopefully end this madness once and for all.

The next day, we got up and ate a hearty breakfast of some local bread and butter tea, before getting in the car. However, there still wasn't any of the weaponry we had been promised. As we got in, Diana opened a compartment in the car. Inside it were eight guns.

“You see these, guys? These are the same guns we have, but have a much longer range.”

“Huh”, I said as I picked one up and inspected it. It did appear slightly different from our previous guns, as its structure was more similar to that of a sniper’s rifle, while our previous guns worked more like a pistol of some sort. Regardless, at that point, I just hoped anything would work.

As we were in the middle of driving through valleys surrounded by towering, snowy mountains, Diana mused, “Do you think the weapons disappearing has something to do with Aurora?”

“Absolutely!”, snorted Raj, “It has to be her doing. She even mentioned it yesterday!”

The rest of the trip passed in complete silence, as the tension in the car became so thick you could cut through it with a knife. And in the circumstances, how could it not be? We knew that for the first time, the deck was not stacked in our favour. It felt like we were plunging headfirst into our deaths.

Regardless, an hour later, we arrived near the coordinates Aurora told us to come to, and turned off the road onto the rocky plateau covered by a thin layer of snow. I sucked in a breath as we drove in, as the place was absolutely breathtaking. It felt like the distant, vast mountains somehow called out to my very soul.

“Let’s stay in the vehicle.”, I suggested, to which Diana agreed as she drove towards the short yet steep cliff that we scoped out on Google Maps the previous night. However, my plan seemed to have been fated to not be, for a drone swooped in around a hundred metres behind the car.

Looking through the rear view mirror, Raj asked, “What’s that thing? And why is it following us?”. Just as he said that, the drone began firing missile-like projectiles vertically down into the ground.

With horror, I realised that we were next.

“The drone’s gaining on us! We need to get out now!”, I yelled as I flung open the door. Diana slammed her foot on the brakes, causing the car to screech to a halt. We then practically threw ourselves onto the ground after grabbing our items, shoes crunching on the snow. When we exited the car, the drone stopped chasing us, instead hovering in the air slightly behind us.

On the cliff far away, I could just make out a solitary figure standing. It looked slightly like a teenage girl…

“There you guys are! I’ve been waiting for you!”, Aurora’s voice boomed from a megaphone.

Ah, so that was her.

“Since you’re here, it’s time for a fun little obstacle course! The distance from here to where I am is one kilometre, and in between we have all sorts of fun little surprises before you can reach me! Good luck!”

“What the hell is she even doing!”, Raj asked frustratedly. “Diana, take out our megaphone!”

From our bag, Diana pulled out the megaphone. Turning it on, she said, “What’s the guarantee you’ll spare us and hand over Sam?”

“You’ll have to take my word for it! Oh, and see those rows of stones there? The local monastery didn’t seem to mind me taking them. If you try to go around them… kaBOOM! Now, do you want your Sam or not?”

Suddenly, the drone behind us revved to a start again, and began swooping down on us. It got low enough that it blew the pristine white snow at us, and I knew we didn’t have much time. As the wind buffeted my body and chilled me to my bones, and the mountain cold bit at every square inch of skin, I knew that we had to do this. I never had more certainty in anything else I had done in my life, except this.

“Guys. We need to get going now. We must do this!”, Raj said, echoing my sentiments. Immediately, the three of us charged into the wide path laid out together.

“Ah, ah, ah! Not so close to each other!” Aurora called out, causing us to separate a bit from each other. As much as we hated dancing to her tune, it seemed the only way at the time. As we continued running towards the cliff…

Suddenly, I heard a boom behind me as a column of fire rose up. The explosion rocked the very ground underneath me, and I heard a body get flung to the ground. Probably Diana.

“It’s a landmine!” Diana yelled. “I accidentally triggered it! Watch your step!”

As I looked around me, I did notice that there were unusual bumps in the layer of snow coating the ground. Could those be the hidden mines? I resolved to steer clear of those, nonetheless. I continued my mad dash down the road, only to find out her next ‘surprise’.

Out of nowhere, more drones started bearing down on us. “Oh no!”, I yelled as I heard the incessant buzz of the drones become louder and louder as the sleek black things converged on my location. Then, they started firing bullets indiscriminately around, a sound that made me jump out of my skin.

“Watch out!”, Diana yelled as a drone swooped at me from the side. I yelped and jumped to my left, cutting it dangerously close to the stone borders. But hey, at least I missed the drone.

From my right, I heard Raj scream a guttural roar.

“What happened?”, I asked out of concern, my voice echoing off the sheer cliffs surrounding me.

“It- it- it shot my shoulder!”, he screamed in pain. Horrified, I realised her endgame was to eventually kill us off one by one. Or worse, all of us at once.

“There you go! That’s the people I hired on the Dark web!” Aurora cheered. At that point, we were more than half the way to the cliff, and I knew I had to act there and then.

I knelt down on the ground, raised my gun and fired straight at Aurora. It was the best shot I had ever shot in my entire life, and it should have splattered her miserable guts all over the mountainside.

Instead, defying all expectations, it simply bounced off her body, falling off her.

In shock, all of us paused running to stare at Aurora, mouths agape. “I… what the fuck was that even?”, I swore.

Aurora smiled slyly at us. “Looks like this is too easy for you people. It’s time for a higher level of difficulty!”

Immediately, more drones advanced on our location. And this time, they were behemoths. They were long, sleek and metallic. And worst of all? They shot missiles at us.

The first shot landed right behind me, flinging chunks of rock everywhere as it made contact with the rocky mountain surface and exploded. I could feel the fire and heat caused, almost as if it was right behind me. No matter, though. I continued running as my ears rang.

Out of the corner of my eye, to my left, there was a missile incoming -

A thunderous boom sounded in my ear as a cloud of dust rose around me, and flaming fumes from the explosion surrounded me. I was knocked straight off my feet… why was I alive even?

Oh, right. I instinctively jumped and rolled over to my side when the missile approached me, so I was spared the grisly fate of being blown to bits where I stood. Just when I thought I was safe, the mine right next to me exploded, showering me in more debris.

“Aaaargh!”, I yelled out.

“Got you there!”, cackled Aurora, “Too bad it didn’t explode fully!”

Well, thank goodness it didn’t. For we were close to finishing.

A minute later, we finally straggled over to the steep cliff on top of which Aurora was standing.

“Well, looks like you made it here!”

“Enough with the games!” Diana yelled, “Get off that cliff and give us Sam!”

“Not so fast!”, she taunted, “The next round is about to begin!”

“Next… round?”, I questioned worriedly. She unrolled three long sections of rope with knots at regular intervals and tossed them down, before stomping down on her end of the rope. “You’ll be climbing up with these! That will keep your hands busy!”

I looked up at the rope and the steep fifteen metre cliff, and gulped.

“Do we really have to do this?”, I asked Diana and Raj, who were next to me on my right.

Diana and Raj looked hesitantly at each other. “We must.” they grudgingly responded. They immediately took to scaling the wall with the rope provided, so I had no choice but to follow. Well, the aforementioned drones were bearing down on us! For some reason, they deftly climbed up the rope provided, while I struggled to drag my body up, my upper body and arm muscles burning. Even Raj, whose shoulder was injured, was somewhat faster than me! A couple minutes later, we somehow made it most of the way up, despite the violent wind that threatened to blow us away. And that was when Aurora introduced her last ‘surprise’.

“Not bad! You managed to get here most of the way! But there’s a condition… only two of you can get up here!”, she gleefully announced.

“Decide amongst yourselves, who goes down!”

The three of us looked at each other, not wanting to come to such a decision. It was a terrible strategy if we wanted to fight Aurora, though our lives were literally in her hands. Or, well, under her feet.

Disregarding her instruction, we scrambled up the rope, determined to reach the top.

“Oh really?”, she said. She loosened the pressure she applied on the rope with her foot, causing our ropes to slide down. “Reconsider.”

“Aaaaaah!”, I screamed as the rope dropped rather gut-wrenchingly. My life flashed before my eyes as I fell!

As she stepped on the rope harder again, I knew that she was not bluffing.

Once again, we looked at each other, but with increasing tension.

“We can’t do this.”, said Diana, “We need to find another way!”

“I’m not of much use here anyways. You guys need to end her.”, Raj said.

“Wait what?”

Raj looked at Aurora straight in the eye. “I’ll go.”

“No!”, I yelled. “What are you doing? Don’t do this! We need you!”

“Well, you’ve made your choice”, replied Aurora, “Sam, come do the honours.”

“Sam?”, I asked in confusion.

From a small cave near where Aurora was standing, Sam walked out. Since the last time I’d seen him, he looked… different. His eyes seemed rather… dead. Like the spark in his eyes had gone out.

“Sam!” Diana cried out as he walked over to our location. He, however, did not seem to hear her. Walking over to Raj’s rope, he pulled out a bolt cutter.

“No, don’t do it!”, I begged.

“Sam! Stop!”, Diana added.

Without heeding our pleas, he severed the rope using the bolt cutter. Raj fell down the roughly ten metre height and slammed into the Himalayan rock.

Even years later, I have never been able to forget the image of Raj’s body lying at the bottom of the cliff, broken, bruised and covered in his own blood. Indisputably, for all purposes, dead. It is a memory that will stay with me till the day I die. I have seen many deaths from that period of time, but I never expected to lose someone so close to me, who I spoke to just a few hours before.

After that, I don’t remember what happened. It was as though I was in a daze.
