“Leh?”, Diana asked, stepping out of the shower. “Where is that?”

“Oh, it’s a city in Jammu and Kashmir. A state in India. I’ve been there a few times before. It’s rather isolated though, why would she be there?”, explained Raj.

“Is Sam there, though?”, Diana asked.

“Yeah, he is with her, apparently.”, I responded.

“Good then! We should go immediately!”

“I agree,” stated Raj, “but just to confirm, you’re fully recovered right?”

Diana grimaced. “Yeah, I’m good enough. It’s fine.”

As we were talking, a ‘ding’ sound came from Diana’s phone. When I opened the notification, it took me to an email sent to us by a random email: four plane tickets.

“Alright guys, the plane is departing three hours later. We have to leave now!”, I announced.
