I’m a university student halfway through my second year studying Art and History.
The last few weeks have been brutal deadlines, pressure, stress. I’m behind in almost everything. My history essays are sprawling and aimless. My artwork looks lazy and uninspired. I’ve been putting in hours but getting nowhere.

And I haven’t been sleeping.

Not because of nightmares. Just… time. There’s never enough of it. I know that sounds like a cliché “I’m a student, I don’t sleep” but it’s true. My schedule’s a mess. I’ll spend an hour trying to start a painting, then spiral into panic because I haven’t done the reading for a lecture I forgot I even had. But this week, somehow, I managed to submit everything.

Not well. Not proudly. But done. For the first time in ages, I could finally breathe. No more all-nighters. No more caffeine-fueled essay sessions or crying over unblended acrylics at 3AM. So I slept And then I dreamt somethinh wrong.

It wasn’t just unsettling. It meant something. It felt like a message.

I was in a wheat feild. It was overgrown and dry, flowing one with the wind. The clouds hung high above me pale, loose, not threatening rain. The strangest thing was the sun: it was both rising and setting at once, dancing between golden and pink light like the sky couldn't make up its mind.

There was nothing on the horizon. Not a tree. Not a distant barn or faraway city tower. Just wheat. Endless painted waves of dry gold rolling over hills and hills of fertile land. And I,  I was the first thing to ever touch it.

The stalks brushed against my legs. They felt sharp at first. But over time, they softened. I left a long trail behind me as I wandered, the pods hissing gently with every step.

I walked for what felt like hours. The only sound was a shallow melody from a type of bug crickets, maybe. Or something else that sings.

Then I saw it.

A blur. Dark. Human-shaped. Far in the distance.

I ran to it like a moth chasing fire. I don’t know why. Something about it pulled me in. But then I tripped and when I got back up. it was gone. I called out. Nothing answered, just a breeze passing through the place where he had stood. Still, I walked on. I crested the hill where the figure had been, and that’s when the land shifted.

The wheat was gone. All of it. In its place, a cold, barren field. Dead grass and pale dirt. The only thing in sight now was a building, a castle. The young golden pink sky now grown, red and dark blue 

It rose in front of me like a monument to madness. Its towers leaned on one another. Its bridges led to nothing. The structure looked ancient, impossible. It wanted to be seen. It was now called to me.

I turned back, just once, and saw that the trail I had left in the wheat was gone. The land had healed. The stalks stood tall again, like I’d never touched them. Like I was never there

I went toward the castle.

The doors were impossibly tall. They didn’t budge at first. I pushed with all my strength, and eventually, they gave just enough for me to slip through.

The inside was dark and choking with dust. Fire lit the walls. Sunlight bled through stained glass the color of rich gold. The air tasted old.

A hallway stretched out before me, lined with huge paintings, each one covered by a sheet. One was only half-covered I looked beneath the cloth.

A knight. Full silver armor. Every inch of it carved with strange, violent incantations  that looked hammered in. Old, evil symbols I didn’t recognize. I couldn’t tell if the armor was meant to repel or welcome darkness.

I didn’t dare lift the cloth to see who or what wore it. At the end of the hall was another set of doors. These opened easier.

Inside: a vast, candlelit dining room. The ceiling stretched upward forever. A chandelier dangled over a table that could seat eighty. Forty chairs on each side. Portraits hung from every wall kings, queens, kingdoms and the lay of the land. All of them staring down with petrified strokes of paint.

And at the far end, before a massive stone fireplace, there was a throne.

Slumped in it was the thing I had seen in the field.

It wasn’t human.

It wasn’t anything.

Its flesh looked sewn together, stretched like old leather or poorly stitched textiles. Its jaw was long. almost animalistic but just plain wrong. Too many teeth. No nose, just a hole. No eyes either Just skin-wrapped sockets that never ended, infinity deep.

And misplaced horns twisted like deer antlers, black and overgrown. Its arm, long and bony, reached toward something in front of it a old, silver, crown with sharp peaks almost like it was forged out of daggers 

Its fingers were skeletal and ended in talons. The arm was wrapped in armor like the knight’s, but cracked and darkened. Similar but warped into a different time.

The creature wore a thick, black cape. The collar was fur, mismatched  prey and predator, hunter and hunted.

It was lifeless.

Hunched.

Dead.

I don’t know why I walked closer. I dont know why I reached out and Touched that crown.

Becacuse That’s when its hand twitched.

I fell backward, scrambling away. Its arm twitched again sharper this time, jerking like a broken puppet. Then it leaned forward, using the table for support.

A sharp crack echoed as its other arm landed with weight. Then, like something rising from a grave, it started to stand.

Its joints popped. Snapped. Every vertebra in its back cracked like breaking branches. Eight feet tall, maybe more with the horns.

I backed away. It was still waking up, if you can call that thing waking.

Its neck bent up, far too slowly. Its jaw opened, wide and yawning. From its throat came a gasping noise that became a growl.
And then unmistakably the word “Who” it sounded angry like a pharo raising to meet a tomb raider

Its eyeless head faced me now. Somehow, it saw me.

It took a step. Dust poured off its robes like falling ash, it was heavy and looked like a toddler taking its first steps but its second step looked sturdier and the third was muscle memory 

I turned. The door wouldn’t open. I slammed into it, again and again. The steps behind me were slow but growing faster. the door burst open. I fell through and landed on my stomach 

I don’t remember crawling. I just remember being on my feet, running through the castle entrance.

The creature didn’t follow. Not fully.

Back in the feilds I turned to look once I was far enough.

He was standing there. Looking at me like an aristocrat. Watching and studying.

For the first time, those eyeless sockets burned. A pair of yellow lights stared through the dusk. Then slowly… he put on the crown and closed the door.

I collapsed in the wheat.

I became part of the land again.

And then I woke up.

I gasped back to life and sat up in bed, covered in a cold sweat. It was still dark out I’d woken up before even my earliest alarm. There was no way I was going back to sleep. Not with that thing still fresh in my mind.

But it wasn’t fear keeping me up. It was infatuation.

I reached for one of my old sketchpads, thumbed through the blank pages, and started drawing.

I didn’t have a name for it yet, but later I started calling him the King.

The kettle boiled and I poured myself a coffee. Three pages of sketches the impossible castle, his face (or what I think was a face), the crown, the painting in the hallway. None of it was my best work, but something about it felt alive. There was potential.

My first class that day was my art workshop. Nothing special just standard uni stuff. But as I packed up, my professor came over to give me some pointers on the mess I’d been working on.
My sketchbook was poking out of my bag. She saw it, casually asked if I’d drawn anything new.

Proud of the chicken scratches I’d made that morning, I flipped to the King’s horrid visiage.

She stared for a moment. Then she gasped not in horror, but excitement.
Within minutes, we were talking about scrapping my current piece and starting a new final project, built around what she called “this surge of inspiration.”

That was it. The King’s portrait was now my new final piece.

And for the first time in weeks maybe months  I felt good. Like I had something real to work toward. Like I’d earned that dream.

But I didn’t know then what I know now.
That it wasn’t just a dream. That he wasn’t just some nightmare.

That he was something older. Something hungrier. Something primordial.

I’ll have to continue this later. I’ve got a lecture in ten minutes and I really can’t afford to fall further behind.
