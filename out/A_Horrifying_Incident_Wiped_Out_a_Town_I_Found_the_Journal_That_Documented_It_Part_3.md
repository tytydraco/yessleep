The static continued to rattle before it was snuffed out by a solid beep. Then, a voice as clear as day emanated from the tiny speaker on the radio. “Hello.” It was not in the manner of a question, as one would say when answering the telephone, but rather a firm greeting. The voice had a gruff drawl heavily weighted in the bass. It was exactly how I imagined Roy would sound. “If you can hear me,” he continued, “hit the red button and speak into the radio.” The voice oozed with authority, commanding me.

I ripped open the bag, snatched up the radio and said, “You got one hell of a throw.” It felt surreal to speak to another person again. My voice sounded unfamiliar. 

“Had a mean right hand in my heyday,” Roy said. “How you holdin’ up?”

“Is this real?” I blurted out.

Roy said, “Son, this is as real as any ass whippin’ my daddy ever laid on me. So, I ask again—how you holdin’ up?”

I sighed. “Not great.” 

“Not great, how?”

“Well, for starters, I think my ankle is broken. I lost all my food after nearly getting my head blown off while attempting to flee this place. I’m down to twelve bottles of clean water. And that’s leaving out all the other fun stuff. So, yeah… not great, Roy.” Hearing myself vocalize my ordeal somehow registered all the desperation, frustration, fear, and anger as if for the first time.

“Your tap water ain’t clean?” 

I found it slightly amusing that that was the question he asked after what I had just described. “No one’s tap water is clean,” I replied. “It’s what caused all this.”

“Your wife confirm that?” 

I paused momentarily, surprised that he knew Julia worked at the plant. “Well… no. She… she… she’s gone.” I had trouble spitting that out. 

He didn’t say anything back. I wasn’t sure if he was taking in the fact that his water wasn’t clean or just being respectful about Julia.

“Do you work at the plant?” I asked. “Is that why you’re here?”

He said, “Me? I wouldn’t know the first thing they do over there. All I know is how to punch and take a punch.” He gave a flat chuckle. “1960 New York Golden Gloves runner up—147-pound division.” He sounded proud. “My wife, though, worked at the plant for seven solid years. She laid the foundation for what the plant has become.” He sounded prouder. “She passed goin' on four years now. Cancer. Them fine folks let me stay here outta respect for all her hard work over them years.” Before I could say anything, he continued. “Who’s that girl runnin’ over to your house that morn' almost butt ass naked?”

I was completely caught off guard. Twenty seconds must have passed before I swallowed the lump in my throat and said, “Going right for the knockout, huh? Isn’t there usually a feeling-out process with boxers?” I tried to distract him by turning his question on himself. 

“Ain’t never been that kind of fighter,” Roy said dryly. “I had a short career.”

Another awkward silence followed. I opened my mouth to speak but hesitated and said nothing.

“You there?”

“Yeah,” I replied. 

“So, who was that young lady?”

I hesitated. “That would be Ada.”

“Ada,” he said immediately after I said the name, as if he knew it all along. “She your friend?”

“She was just my neighbor.”

Roy reasserted his commanding tone. “Ain’t nobody here but me and you. Shit, we may be the only two cats left in this joint. I may be all you got. It’s best you be truthful, son.”

I felt my face flush red with shame and embarrassment, as if Roy was right in front of me. I dreaded answering, but there was something about him that pulled it out of me. “We, umm… we were having an affair.”

This time, it was Roy’s turn to be silent. I pictured him contemplating whether he’d want to help or receive help from someone of my character. It didn’t matter if I was the only other person around here. I was despicable. “Are you still there?” I finally said.

“Eat up. We’ll talk later.”

Later that night, I had just lit a candle when Roy’s voice came through the radio. “Hey, you there?”

I picked up the radio and said, “Evening, Roy.”

“You down for a game of Battleship?”

My schedule was open for the night. I said, “Yeah, why not?” The game was a staple from my grade school days. I flipped open the small metal box, doubling as the game board and started setting up my ships by candlelight. And for the next few minutes, Roy proceeded to school me in the child’s game. It was like he was clairvoyant. I don’t think he even wasted a turn. All five of my ships were sunk to his one in no time.

When the game was over, Roy said, “Let’s go again.” He said it as if it was an order.

“I don’t think so, Roy.” We just met, and his alpha male disposition was already getting to me. If we were to help each other, I could not let him dictate things. It had to be a 50-50 partnership, and I had to establish that early. Taking commands from him at a time like this could mean the death of me. “I think I’m going to hit the hay,” I said.

“C’mon, you ain’t sleepin’ good.” 

The sheer confidence in his voice pissed me off. The fact that he was right pissed me off even more. “How do you know that?” I snapped. “And how do you know other people’s business, like my wife working at the plant and not me?” 

“You think anybody is sleepin’ good?” 

He answered so calmly it only irritated me more. I remained quiet.

“To answer your second question—there ain’t much happenin’ in my household. Not for a while now. I look out my window to see what’s happenin’ in others’.” 

“You knew about Ada and me. That’s why you always gave me the stink eye.” I was buzzing.

“Tell me 'bout your wife, Julia.” Roy said her name like he needed to remind me who she was. “What she like?”

The mere mention of her name defused my energy. I felt a sudden and odd urge to comply. “Julia was the single smartest person I had ever known.” I paused. Referring to Julia in the past tense caused a micro fracture in my voice. “I’m not just talking academics,” I continued. “I mean, academically, she had no ceiling. I’m talking life. She just knew how people worked, how the world worked. She had it all figured out. And that allowed her to move through life so effortlessly, so free of stress. She knew what she wanted to do, and she did it. I never heard her complain about time moving quickly. That’s because she was always present in the moment—fully aware and enjoying it all. You can imagine my skepticism when a mutual friend set her up with me—the ultimate pessimist who needed three attempts to get his CPA certification. You can imagine my surprise when she fell for me. What was a girl like that doing with a schmuck like me? She could have had her pick. Believe me, there was no shortage of men to choose from. Each would have cut off a hand and slapped his mother with it if it meant he could be with her. But she chose me. And when she loved me, she was all in. I mean, all hands on deck, body strapped, ready to roll. Fully committed.”

“You think she knew ‘bout you and Ada?” Roy asked.

“No. Because as smart as she was, she was blinded by her love for me. I exploited that.”

“Did you not love her no more?”

“No, of course not.”

“Then why’d you mess around on her?”

I hesitated. Up until this point, I don’t think I had even asked myself that question. I considered the question briefly. “I saw the same face day in and day out for years. At some point, the mind and eyes start to wander, I guess. It’s not uncommon to want the newer and shinier model. You know how it is, right?”

“Nope,” Roy said quickly. The *P* popped with emphasis.

I pretended not to hear that. “It started as a seed of curiosity. Then, it bloomed into something more, something bigger. When Ada came around, she satisfied that feeling. To discover that I could connect with someone other than my wife in an entirely different way was exciting. My ego relished in the reality that someone else other than Julia wanted me like how so many others wanted her. Even though she didn’t wield it, Julia had that power. Having both Julia and Ada gave me a sense of that power, and I liked it."

“You remorseful?”

“Yes,” I said, almost in a whisper. “But I suppressed it. Things with Ada wouldn’t have lasted as long as they did if I didn’t suppress it. In my head, I once came clean to Julia. I wanted to do it for real, but I balked. I was afraid everything I have—the means to not work, the freedom, Ada, Julia—would all disappear.” The lump in my throat returned, stopping me momentarily. “That day I saw Julia’s lifeless, mutilated body, I was surprised I didn’t feel anything for her. But now I understand I did feel something. I was just confused because what I felt was relief. I was relieved that I’d never have to tell Julia the truth. Can you believe that, Roy? What kind of a person feels that way seeing their dead wife?” I caught myself forcing those last words out because my voice was wavering. “This woman gave me everything, loved me unconditionally, and I couldn’t shed one tear for her.” Just then, the saltiness touched my lips.

“Think you just did, son,” Roy said.

I put my hand to my face and felt the wet tracks.

“Did y’all have children?”

“A son—Callum,” I said, sniffling.

“Where’s he at?”

“Back home. Stateside. He started college this year.”

“How do y’all get along?”

“We don’t,” I said. “I was rarely there for him, and he recognized that early. He was right to cut me out.” I laughed, breaking from my teary release.

“What's so funny?” Roy said.

“The more I talk to you, the more I think you’re not real, Roy. You’re just a trick of the mind. A construct created by my mind to keep the lights on up there. The real Roy—or whatever his name is—is a goner. I’m just sitting here in the dark, talking to myself on the radio. Maybe I’m confessing my sins and shortcomings as a husband and father so I’m not sent to the basement when the lights go out. But it’s too late. I’m already trapped in my private hell. I’m all alone.”

“My very real stomach is whippin’ my ass for givin’ your ass four cans of soup,” Roy said. “Now, there ain’t no doubt you in hell. But it ain’t private. My sorry ass is there too.”

“Tell me something then,” I said. “How are you so composed?”

“What you gettin’ at?”

“You see what’s out there. You know the fate that awaits you. You’re facing it alone. Yet, it seems like just another day to you.” I wanted to challenge him, to catch him out. My psyche was coming off at the seams. He was as cool as ice. It didn’t seem possible to me.

There was dead air. I stared at the radio gripped in my hand. *I had done it*, I thought. He’s just my imagination, and I’ve gotten rid of him. I dropped the radio onto the table. But the moment it hit the wood, it came back to life.

“I lost everything,” Roy said, just a hair louder than a whisper. It was the first time since we spoke that he did not boom over the radio. “Multiple times,” he continued. “I’ve been alone more than not in my life. I learned to live with it. Way before all this shit started. Simple as that.” He took a breath. “But I’ll tell you what, son. You wanna go at it alone, be my gue—.”

“Tell me about your wife.” I cut him off. I figured I could still use the company even if he was a figment of my imagination. “It’s fair that you reciprocate, right?” I gripped the radio tight, willing him to respond. Then he did.

“No disrespect to Julia, but ain’t nobody even come close to Estelle May Warren, far as I’m concerned.” Suddenly, Roy wouldn’t stop talking. “Nobody that beautiful had any business being as smart and kind and tough as she was, I’ll tell ya that. I mean, that lady was fearless. The night we met, she was givin’ some creepo the business at the bar I was bouncin’ at. The left hook she gave him damn near knocked him into the century.” His voice raised with enthusiasm. “I took care of him for her. Then, one look at her, and it was a wrap. She knocked me off my feet better than any one of my opponents could. Since that day, she was there with me in the gym and all my fights. All the while doing her studies and research. The groupies came callin’ after each fight, but I only had eyes for her. Stayed that way until she passed.”

Hearing that he succeeded in what I failed at annoyed me.

“Comin’ up,” Roy continued, “her family, they ain’t have clean water in their poor little town. It inspired her to help those with the same struggles. Led us here in the end. It was my turn to support her. She was living her purpose, helping these folks. Then the cancer took her. She didn’t go quietly. Fought like hell. I was proud of my girl.” He went silent and then spoke again. “Same cancer took our baby girl years before. She fought hard, just like her mama. Ain’t that some shit.”

That night, I’d learn so much about Estelle and Roy’s daughter, Trina, that it felt like they were in my memories this entire time.

We were just across the alley from one another, but it might as well have been a great chasm that divided us. We never saw each other, never exchanged visits. I would receive a can of soup every few days to keep me going. Some batteries would keep my radio going. Not everything would land in my pool like before. But they would just appear there without me asking for them. We’d talk daily, mostly in the night. It was always me initiating our conversations. Little by little, we learned more about each other. Roy would bark an order every so often. I learned to pick my battles. Sometimes, I let him have his way. Other times, I wouldn’t budge. This was something I tolerated for the sake of not being completely alone. 

But was I actually alone? This question visited me often. I dug into the recesses of my mind, trying to remember instances of myself laying food and batteries in my pool for me to find. Each time, I could not recall doing any of those things. Then, I doubted whether I remembered correctly. It was an unending cycle. I had read that the mind creates false memories and happenings to protect itself after a traumatic event. I wondered if this was happening to me. Roy could be a mechanism of my own making to help me survive. After all, we had never spoken before all this. I never knew what he sounded like. 

“Do me a favor, Roy,” I had said on one occasion. “Step out of your house so I can see you. I need to see you. You do it when you send things over anyway.”

He scoffed. “Son, the more I talk to you, the more I think you done lost all your damn marbles. There ain’t no way, no how, you’d ever be a boxer. Even in your imagination.” 

As much as I disliked it, I agreed with him. 

“Look out your window,” he continued. “My house is a fortress. I ain’t taking no chances. Anybody or anything wanna get in here, they gotta earn it.”

He was right. Every window in his house was boarded up with broken furniture. More of that furniture formed a surrounding barrier around his back door. It stood high and allowed for an area between it and his door. A makeshift door sat in the middle, giving him access to the outside. While not entirely impossible, it was impressive. But could he have really built that? I decided not to get my brain any more tangled. Besides, had I seen him, I still wouldn’t have trusted my eyes.

Though I now had a companion, it was only my face I saw each day. And with each day that went, so did a part of my body. Each part lost was conspicuous because there was not much left to be taken. All my daily workouts had stopped to conserve my calories. I was under no illusions that I was drifting towards oblivion. But waking up the next day was a tiny bit easier just having Roy there.

It was subtle at first but soon became easily detectable. A sentence became slurred; a breath became labored. There was something wrong with Roy. I questioned him about it.

He said, “Been a few days without my insulin. Runnin’ on empty.” He was so casual in delivering such catastrophic news that you’d think it was nothing at all. “Dryin’ up on food too.”

Roy fed me cans of soup while his reserve was dwindling. I felt ashamed that my first thought was on how this affected me. I then realized it had been the most amount of days since his last delivery. He likely no longer had the inventory and strength to chuck anything over anymore. 

“Are you OK?” I said. Dumb question.

“It is what it is.” His speech was slow but even. There was no fear.

“Roy, why didn’t you say something?”

He chuckled, but it was cut short by a cough. “And you’ll do what, son?”

I stammered. “I… I… I can head out and get us what we need. Your medication, food.” I said the words as if somebody else was going to do that. Until now, neither of us ever mentioned venturing out of our houses. We didn’t need to. Plus, we knew the terror and peril that waited beyond our walls. But this was it. This was the catalyst to drive us out of our safe zones. Something different needed to be done. 

“You already forgot the last time you went to town?” Roy sucked in a breath.

“No,” I said. “I don’t mean head into town. *Here*. The corner store.” My hands began to vibrate. “There’s that drug cabinet in the back. That’s where you got your insulin, right?”

Roy made a noise, noting affirmative.

“I’ll collect whatever food I can find while I’m there,” I said.

“You barely makin’ it across the street with your ankle. It’s at least seven blocks away.”

Thoughts sprouted in my head. Butterflies fluttered in my stomach. “Gerry, Ada’s husband. He has—had a car. I know where he kept the key. That’s my ride to the store. I’ll be in and out.”

“Say you get there,” Roy said. “What about them things lurkin’ about?”

“I saw what those things do to one another. There may not be many of them left after these many days. I have a shot at this.”

“Been in many wars in my time. They’d have to put me to sleep to keep me from fighting. But even I know it’s time to lay down now, son.”

“What are you saying, Roy?”

“You know what I’m saying. Stay put.”

I was incredulous. The tough, no-nonsense boxer was throwing in the towel. “You’re just going to roll over and die here?” I said. “What happened to helping each other?”

“We have, and we are, son. We givin’ each other human connection when it ain’t ‘posed to be possible in a time like this. I been alone far too long. In the gym, in the ring, in life. Loneliness is the damnedest prison. I done a lot of time. I’m happy I got out these last few days of my life.” Sorrow dripped from his words like tears from weeping eyes. Underneath his hard shell, the loneliness had eaten him alive.

It became apparent to me what Roy’s plan was all along. He wanted—*needed*—a companion to live out his last days. To just sit while the body and mind slipped away. Or was it just the part of my mind that housed Roy slipping away? Whatever the case, it was not my plan. I had a life before all this. A good life. I had people and things to call my own. I wanted all of that again. I was young enough to still have a life ahead of me. 

I said, “I’m going, Roy. I’m going to save us.”

After a long night of plotting, the sun finally dragged itself up over the horizon. I had envisioned the route to the store and the building’s layout as vividly as I could remember it. Get in, make a beeline to the medicine cabinet, return through the canned foods aisle, and get the hell out. The scenario looped over and over in my head like a film reel. But up until my front door opened, it did not dawn on me that I would actually carry out my plan. It was time to move. Adrenaline forced every one of my senses to be on full alert. My heart pounded so loud I feared it would beckon one of those things to me.

“Watch your back, son,” Roy had said. His voice was devoid of hope. His words were a veiled goodbye.

My eyes caught my heavily wrapped ankle, and for a split second, I doubted myself, too. It was not lost on me that I could be on a suicide mission to fetch medicine for someone who may not exist. Even if he did, he may not take it. I reminded myself this trip was ultimately for me. The fresh, burning air snapped me back into focus. I scanned the empty street slowly and stepped back into the empty stillness.

Getting to Ada’s front door was easy enough. I moved along the front of my house, keeping the wall against my back. I was quick but methodical. Any noise from my makeshift crutch was suppressed by the thick wad of fabric I had fastened to the tip. Ada’s front door was wide open. She left it as such when she stumbled over that morning. I took two quiet steps into the house. Like everywhere else, the air was stale and dead silent. I peered over at the living room and up the stairs—spaces that used to be filled with our voices. I was about to step further in, but a rumbling upstairs halted me. I was not certain if it was just my imagination.

By the door was a small wooden bureau. Atop the bureau was a metal dish in the shape of a palm leaf. Quietly, I nudged a wallet to the side of the leaf and picked up the car keys. I was out of there.

I moved quickly to the carport at the side of Ada’s house, further away from mine. Parked there was the same model RAV4 as Julia’s. I hopped in, and I told myself I was doing great. It took multiple turns of the key for the engine to awake from its long slumber. I eased the gas pedal with my left foot and cruised out onto the street. 

The RAV4 was the only source registering any decibels. This town, once bustling with families, friends, and co-workers, was now a ghost town. The rows of houses appeared drained of any color. All were now painted under the dull, broad stroke by Death’s hand. 

Unlike my last ride, I didn’t put pedal to floor. I was heading to the store and did not want to lead a parade of those things on my way there. I cruised at a medium pace, letting the engine purr quietly. About halfway through my planned route, movement in the rearview mirror caught my attention. I slowed the car slightly and watched a woman place a white grocery bag at the doorstep of a house. I was far enough away to not see the person’s face. The woman did not seem to care about or notice my vehicle. Then she turned and sprinted away. Whoever it was, she had guts.

I resumed my cruising speed as I continued my drive to the store. The cool air conditioning provided a welcomed touch against my clammy skin. My ankle pulsed with aching resentment. 

I made a turn, and the store appeared before me. There was only a fleeting moment of relief before a hefty stone dropped in my stomach. The store’s double entry doors were located near one corner. Beside it and spanning to the other corner was a large window. Both were completely smashed in and blocked by a four-car pileup. One car was turned to its side and rested on the other three. Two of the four cars still contained their drivers’ decayed corpses. The store was not a very large building. There simply was no more real estate to gain access. Even in my diminutive state, I did not see myself squeezing through any gaps between the vehicles. That is if I didn’t want to be sliced up by the jagged glass and metal. Any hope I had of entering through the front was dashed. 

I drove the car past the carnage and looped to the back of the store. The rear was completely clear, save for a large dumpster blocking the back entrance. I parked right beside the dumpster, did a three-sixty scan, and quietly exited the vehicle, leaving behind my crutch. The engine idled and continued to purr like the nervous rumbling in my stomach. I gave the dumpster a stiff shove. The momentum carried it away. Its sun-dried wheels squealed, spiking my already uncontrollable anxiety. I knew I had to move quicker now. With both hands on the large door handle, I twisted it, but it wouldn’t budge. The heavy steel door was bolted from the inside. 

Doubt crept into my mind as I scanned the back of the building. The dark exterior was bare of any windows. But there, roughly four feet above the door, was the opening to an air duct. The grille hood usually covering such an air duct was nowhere to be found. The metal interior of the duct glimmered in the sun and caught my eye. Otherwise, I would have taken it for a part of the wall. 

I evaluated the opening and was confident I could squeeze through. I pulled the dumpster back to its original position. It squealed again. Pulling myself up onto the dumpster, I stood on the edge for solid support. I reached up and gripped the bottom edge of the air duct. A tandem pull-up and kick off the wall later, and I was at eye level with the opening. With one hand still gripped on the edge, I pressed the other into the shaft. My hand was clammy and felt like a suction cup against the metal. I gritted my teeth and pulled myself in. Both hands moved in further, establishing new grips. A few more pulls, and I was fully into the air duct. 

Had it not been for the dimness, I would have been certain my hands were blue. Arms extended forward, I lay down, utterly spent. My muscles—what little of it left over my weak bones—screamed in pain. I began heaving, sucking in big gulps of air in the confined space. Inside was like a filthy oven. The air was unbearably hot and congested. Dust swirled and danced, triggered by my every move and breath. Every inhale was like a suffocating punch to the lungs. Each labored breath was followed by a cough that echoed down the hollow shaft.

When my muscles regained enough strength, I propped myself onto my elbows. The top of my head bounced off the ceiling of the air duct. More unwanted noise. It was then that I realized just how little room I had. The narrow width of the air duct allowed for less than a forty-five-degree bend at the knees. My elbows were forcibly tucked against my body. I was able to turn my head just enough to peer over my shoulder at the opening behind me. The daylight was not far-reaching into the air duct. Looking at the passageway before me was like staring into a dark abyss. It only served to make the air duct more claustrophobic. I was sweating bullets and hyperventilating. The fear of the unknown, of getting stuck, invaded my mind. I closed my eyes and breathed softly through my nose. The mental battle had to be fought and conquered then and there, or I would be a corpse stuck in an air duct. 

Soon after, I opened my eyes and got moving. Conscious to suppress any noise, all my movements were slow. I led with one forearm in front of the other and coordinated with a push from my legs. It was a pathetic attempt at an army crawl, but I was moving forward. In that moment, I was almost grateful for my near-skeletal frame. At full frame, I certainly would not have been able to maneuver the way I did. 

The deeper I traveled into the air duct, the more light faded around me. Another look behind me confirmed I was a good way in. The opening was now a small shining halo that appeared almost unreachable. This brought me some relief only because it meant I was closer to the medicine cabinet. I wondered where the passageway would end and hoped for a soft landing below when it did. Eventually, I reached a fork ahead. I reached out into the dimness and felt the split of the air duct. Without any knowledge of where each path would take me, I chose blindly and crawled to the left. 

There was now only the slightest sliver of light coming from behind me. The light shifted as I moved, barely illuminating the path in front of me. I went deeper into the dark. The floor of the shaft suddenly felt slick. My forearms slipped like I had crawled over an oil drip. I continued onward. All I heard was the swishing of my pants against the air duct when a noise cut through the repetition. It was blunt, like someone trying to force a large balloon through the metal shaft. I stopped and listened. The acoustics within the shaft made the noise sound like it was all around me. I lay as flat as I could—allowing more light in behind me—and squinted hard. I was able to make out some subtle movements. Then, my heart dropped, followed by every fiber in my body. A freezing chill glided over me, and the air duct was suddenly no longer like an oven. My sweat-drenched clothes draped over me like a cold, wet blanket. 

Mere inches from my face was a pair of bare human feet. They started to move frenetically as if whomever they belonged to was trying to kick at me.

“Somebody there?” I froze at the voice of the owner of the feet. It was a man. He sounded every bit as frightened as me. “I’m stuck.” He laughed nervously and said, “Help me out?”

The question—so desperate and stupid—pulled me out of my frozen fear. *He doesn’t know*, I thought. I immediately backpedaled as fast as I could. My elbows now pushed me back instead of pulling me ahead. My knees and feet did the same. I slipped on the first few pushes but then gained a little momentum. There was no more finesse. I was moving loudly, banging against the walls. But as frantic as I was, it felt as though my hands were welded to the metal. Nothing I did felt fast enough. 

“Hey! Hey! Come back!” the man screamed. “Where are you going? Help me! Please! Don’t go! Plea—Puh… lea… sss.”
