I tried to run. I know. Bad idea. But most of you haven’t felt what I felt that night. At least, I hope you haven’t. For your own sake.

There is little in the world that is more terrifying than your heart wrenching with fear as you lie in bed, drenched in your own sweat, eyes wide and fixed on the ceiling. Keenly aware of your own mortality. Any man, anyone, any living thing, would want to get away from anything that makes them feel that way. So, I ran.

By the way, I thought I should provide you guys with an easy way to keep track of these experiences, if only to have a neat log of my death throes for posterity's sake. So, I made an index. After all, this is looking to be getting a little voluminous. I’ll keep updating it as and when I post, provided I’m not actively in the jaws of some monstrosity at that point. Check at the end of this for the link.

Anyway, after a refreshing afternoon siesta, it was time to meet my lawyer. I put on one of the clean white tunics the servants had left out while I was sleeping. As the evening fell, the air was growing chilly, and the wind was picking up across the open fields outside, so I had Bhanu bring me a shawl. Not carrying a good jacket or sweater had been an oversight. I had completely forgotten how cold it could get in these remote places at night, even outside of winter.

What I did not forget was to swipe Ramu’s knife off the table and stick it in one of my pockets. I was not making the mistake of being unarmed, even inside the house.

My uncle was waiting for me as I threw the shawl around my shoulders and descended the stairs. He was similarly dressed in a woollen shawl and a tunic, his smile in its usual place.

“Now you look the part, kid. All that shirt and jeans bullshit won’t fly in this house.”

I chuckled, picking at the edges of the shawl. “I almost feel like I belong here. Part of the scenery, you know? Almost.”

“Hey. This is your home.” He walked up and grabbed my shoulder. “That remains true, no matter how many years you spend away from it. Your father did what he thought was best when he left. I don’t blame him. But even he always felt its pull. Whenever something went wrong, he would be on his way here the next day. We never even needed to call. He just felt it, and he came back.”

“He came back. And he died.”

He nodded. “And he died.”

“What happened that night, *kaku*? I deserve to know.”

“You do.” He sighed and took his hand off my shoulder, turning his back to me. “But I cannot tell you. He never discussed it with me, though I asked. Not with any of us. Only your grandfather knows what truly happened. At least, he knew.”

“I see.”

“I’m sorry.” He looked back at me. “This place has painful connotations for you, as it has for all of us. You did not want to come back, and I can understand why. But you’re here now. And you’re family. Our family. All of us are with you. Whatever this is… we can handle it. We always have.”

I stepped closer to him. “Grandfather could not do it, and he knew this land from birth.”

“And through him, and us, so will you.” He faced me again. “On that note, we must speak soon. About the situation here. You’ve had enough excitement for one day, but tomorrow, come find me. There is information to cover. There are rituals to be performed. The coming of a new *Thakur* is a crucial time. Nothing can go wrong.”

“I don’t understand.”

“It’ll all make sense eventually. Trust me, kid.” He gestured at the hallway. “The lawyer’s in the study. You should go see him now. He’ll explain the mundane side of things to you. Property, finances. You know it better than me.”

“That makes one thing.” I sighed. “Thanks, uncle. By the way, where are the others?”

“My brothers? They’re out for tonight. Working. You’ll see them in the morning.” He gave me a small wave, nodding towards the study. “Go. Don’t want him to get mad.”

The study was exactly as I had left it in the vision. The only difference was the dust that hung like a thick pall over the room. Evidently, it had not been aired out or cleaned since the disappearance of its last owner. Mercifully, the power was on this time, so the chandelier-like light overhead was working, illuminating the room with a diffuse yellow glow.

A portly, balding man in a suit struggled out of one of the chairs when he saw me enter, extending a hand.

“Mr. Sen, so nice to finally meet you. My sincerest condolences about your grandfather.”

“Thank you.” I gestured at him to take his seat and took one of my own.

We faced each other across a small table.

“Mr. Sen, my name is Jacob Durham, of Durham and Co. Solicitors in Kolkata. I have worked closely with your grandfather for a long time. I was shocked to learn of his untimely demise. And in such a tragic manner too.”

I nodded. “It came as a shock to us all. Life has been a whirlwind ever since.”

“I imagine so.” He produced a briefcase from behind his chair and set it on the table. “Of course, the association between our firm and your family goes back much farther. We have worked with your estate for almost two centuries now, ever since 1825. My father, his father, and his father before him have all served your family. And now, I get to continue the line with you.”

“I understand you’re here with details about the inheritance.” I saw right through his attempts to create a sense of familiarity. It was a common trick of the trade. But with me, that relationship would have to be earned through competence.

“Indeed.” He sharply opened the briefcase and produced a few stacks of documents, lists, and diagrams. “I understand you are in our noble profession yourself. Good. Then this should not take as long as I feared.”

It still took several hours. I won’t bore you with the details, but it suffices to say that the implications are staggering. The manor and the surrounding lands were directly the personal possessions of the family, with some of it beyond the current boundaries leased out on long-term covenants to farmers. Beyond that, we held revenue rights and limited administrative rights over the entirety of the village land, as set out in the survey records he showed me. We also owned the forest behind the estate, as well as the mountain beyond it that served as the natural landmark before which Chhayagarh was built.

Okay, I should probably explain the forest. I told you the land was dry and hard, and that’s still true. But somehow, right at the base of the mountain, the place has managed to grow a lush, dense forest. Such vegetation density is not present anywhere else in the region. A part of the forest falls within our estate walls and contains the family grove, but most of it is outside, with only a narrow path winding through it to reach the steps that lead up the mountain. I theorize that the mountain caught what little rain the place gets and concentrated it there to allow the forest to grow, but knowing what I know now, there could have been some occult shit involved.

In any case, I found out that there were even more remote assets: townhouses in Kolkata and some other cities, satellite estates in the countryside, temple and shrine revenue, old hunting and lumber forests, business ventures, and even investment portfolios and commercial real estate. Even accounting for the maintenance and labour costs to keep everything functional, the property was raking in an absurd amount of money.

“Someone has been putting in the work to grow the pie,” I muttered, rifling through some deeds that described stakes in offshore oil blocks in the Americas.

“The family has been accumulating its assets for centuries, Mr. Sen. Usually, such estates lose a lot to mismanagement over the years, but I’m happy to report that such is not the case with yours.”

“A lot to keep track of.”

“I wouldn’t worry about it. Most of these assets are handled by a network of trusts and corporations with experienced administrators. Trustworthy ones. We have spent a lot of time perfecting the governance structure. I will send the documents over if you like, but the gist is that we can take care of maintaining and growing the estate. You need only decide how to best spend the windfall. Your family has always invested heavily in the village, both for welfare and other, more esoteric purposes. Those ones, I never fully understood.”

“You and me both, Mr. Durham. You and me both.”

He shrugged lightly. “I’m not paid to ask questions. In any case, if you ever need anything from the estate, let me know. We’ll make it happen.”

One of you had prompted me to think about the legal status of our *zamindari* all the way back in my first post, so I took the opportunity to pop the question.

“Ah.” Durham scratched his chin, smiling. “That’s a good question, Mr. Sen. Actually, there are laws on the books specifically about Chhayagarh, ever since the British administration. But we think these laws are based on even older laws. We have found *firmans* from the Sultans and the Mughals specifically protecting your family’s rights over this village, and decrees from the Hindu and Buddhist kings before them. They’re really obscure and difficult to retrieve. Almost redacted. But these laws all exempt this village from any land redistribution laws or other such measures. We keep checking periodically to see if all is in order, but in short, your family’s right over this inheritance is specifically and particularly protected by legislation. It has been so for as long as we have records.”

“Why were these laws passed?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

“We are not aware. Maybe your family lobbied for them. Maybe the government had reasons of its own. Either way, the better for you and the worse for them.” He replaced the papers in his suitcase, leaving only a few out for me to sign. “Feel free to go through these. They will confirm the estate handover, the continuance of the governance structure, and other procedural things. All routine.”

It took about half an hour more until I was done reading and signing. Then Durham took the papers and replaced them in his case. Despite the name, he looked as native as I did, so I guessed he must have had some English blood somewhere up the tree.

“Now, as for the personal possessions your grandfather left you…” He rose to his feet and crossed over to a corner behind me. “Excuse me.”

When he returned, he held three parcels of varying sizes, as well as a sturdy wooden walking stick. “I had sealed these for safekeeping in my custody when I was instructed to, in accordance with your grandfather’s instructions. I warrant that no one has tampered with them since I retrieved them, though I cannot know what happened prior to my arrival.”

I nodded. He was a little too formal with me, given his advanced age. “So, these are the articles he left me?”

“Indeed. Firstly…” He handed me the stick. “Your grandfather’s walking stick. It has apparently been a long-time family heirloom, used by eight *Thakurs* before you. He wanted you to have it. Use it if you wish.”

I raised it to the light, studying it. I recognized the gnarly top, the darkish wood, and the simple metal tip at the bottom. Not just because I had seen it in that fateful vision. I remembered it well from my childhood: the telltale, comforting clacks echoing through the halls, indicating my grandfather on his regular rounds through the house.

“Then, we have this.” He opened one of the packages and handed me a gold-and-black ring, decorated with heraldry: a circular shield with a ribbon framing it, crossed over by a sword and a torch. Two lions held it up on either side. There was no motto.

“That is your family crest. This ring has been used as a symbol of office by the head of your family since time immemorial. I recommend you keep it and wear it all the time. It is both priceless and timeless.”

I slipped it onto my left index finger. It fit snugly; in fact, it may have been the light playing tricks on me, but I could have sworn I saw it shift and change size, adapting to my measurements.

“A natural fit. Truly, you boys are born into this role.” Durham gave me a polite smile, before moving on to the next package. “You own all the books in the family libraries and archives anyway, but your grandfather specifically insisted I hand this one over to your hands only. It took a while to track down. He had it in a bank locker all the way out in Singapore.”

He handed me a worn book. There was no title or name on the cover, but from looks alone, that was not surprising. It wasn’t a novel. It was a journal.

“This book was not listed in the preservation records of the family chronicles. I had no idea it even existed a few weeks ago, except that I perhaps saw your grandfather writing in it once. But that was many years ago.”

“What does it say?” I turned it around in my hands, hoping some clue would appear to explain it all. Unfortunately, there was nothing.

Durham gave me a crisp and incredulous laugh. “Mr. Sen, you must think me an amateur if you are implying that I would rifle through my client’s possessions. Please, find out at your own leisure. In any case…” He unwrapped the last package.

It revealed a simple golden necklace, completely unadorned. The pendant held nothing except one large, whitish stone. It was almost like a pearl, but the texture was off.

“What is that?” I raised an eyebrow.

“I have no idea. I only found out about it when your grandfather told me to secure it in his study after he was gone. He was extremely insistent that you wear it at all times.”

“This thing?” It did not go with my fashion at all, to be honest.

He shrugged again. “It’s yours now, Mr. Sen. Wear it. Kick it. Burn it. Your call. But he really was very insistent when he called me up about it, the night he disappeared.”

I perked up at that. “He called you that night?”

“Yes, shortly before he set out, from what I heard. That’s when he told me to facilitate the transfer of the estate to you and hold onto these articles. For if… when something happened.”

“He knew? That he was going to…”

“He said it was a possibility.” Durham sighed. “Your grandfather did this often, you know. Planning for his own death. It wasn’t even the first time this year that I had received such a call. I know he did something dangerous. Something to do with this place. But he never let me in on the details. I never thought… I never thought it would be real this time.” He sighed again, pressing his fingers to his temples.

“Sounds like you were really close.” More to placate him than anything else, I slipped on the necklace right then and there. “I’m sorry.”

“Family is family, Mr. Sen. Your loss far outstrips mine.” He got to his feet, slowly buttoning his coat. “Now, it is getting rather late. That more or less concludes our business. If you have any more questions, I am here till tomorrow afternoon. If there’s something after that, well… I’m always just a phone call away. Though your grandfather preferred his letters. Either works for me.”

I got to my feet as well, and we shook hands. “Good night, Mr. Durham, and thank you. For everything.”

After this, dinner was another blur. Durham took his food in his room, I was told. I talked with my grandmother and uncle. Just polite chitchat, nothing important. I think paying some compensation to Ramu’s father was discussed. My uncle said he would take care of it. Servants were whirling in and out, replacing dishes and utensils. But my mind was elsewhere. On the ring, on the book, on the necklace. On the walking stick, of all things.

Why did my grandfather think I needed to have these things? And these things in particular?

Despite my curiosity, I found quickly that I was in no condition to burn the midnight oil. My eyes began drooping almost as soon as I entered the bedroom. The day had taken its toll. The journal would have to wait for tomorrow, I told myself. I took the ring off and placed it on the nightstand, alongside the knife. I was about to do the same with the necklace, but as soon as I touched the clasp, my fingers tingled. A sense of impending danger stabbed into my skull like a knife. I decided to leave it where it was.

Thank the gods for that.

It was late when I snapped awake.  The power had gone out again, but the room was still cool. The nights could get downright chilly here. That was not something to be concerned about.

What was concerning was that it was getting colder, and fast. My breath was beginning to mist, and the metal bedframe was icy to the touch. The cold was almost alive, malicious even, as it wormed its way deep into my body. I had never experienced it myself, but I imagined this is what people who fell into frozen lakes felt. Cold, deeper and stronger than anything they had ever felt before.

My joints barely moved, as if stuck in jelly. Soon, frost began to form on the ceiling, slowly inching its way outwards and down the walls.

The only warm thing in the room was the necklace. Hell, it was scorching, like an open flame against my collarbone. At that moment, I was almost afraid I would soon start smelling burning flesh. Heat and cold. What a way to die.

The same overwhelming sense of danger stabbed over and over into my brain, seeming to point towards the only window in the room. It was on the far wall from the door, behind and to the side of the bed. Slowly, forcing my neck to work through the chill, I turned my head to look at it.

The room I had been furnished with had no balcony of its own. The only thing outside that window was a thin ledge, mostly decorative, though workers could attach scaffolding to it if they needed to do repairs. At the moment, no repairs are required.

But all the same, there was a face pressed against the window. A pale woman with long dark hair cascading past her shoulders. She had a small smirk on her face, staring right at me through the glass. The stabbing pain in my head reached a new fever pitch. The necklace positively throbbed with heat, in tune with my quickening heartbeat.

The window was locked, held in place by two heavy deadbolts. For now, those seemed to be in place. The woman had noticed my gaze upon her. Her smirk split into a full-on smile and she leaned closer and planted a small kiss on the glass. Frost radiated outwards from her lips, crackling as it spread.

I could feel my pupils dilate in panic. The cold was reaching an intolerable level now, deadening every inch of skin. I tried to sit up, but my muscles were spasming, working slowly and hesitantly. Or not at all.

The window was completely frosted now, with only a translucent outline of the woman outside visible. I saw her raise her hand and touch it.

Then, the thick glass exploded inwards, scattering shards all over the floor. The cool night air blew in, chilling the air even more. Along with it came thick, billowing mist, covering the floor and furniture until it looked more like a swamp than a room.

A bare, slender leg extended through the ragged hole in the window, almost gingerly stepping into the mist. The cold went up another few notches. My teeth were chattering uncontrollably, and every muscle was frozen to a standstill. I had little choice but to keep watching as the rest of her body followed, twisting like a serpent as it passed through the narrow opening. Frost began to climb up the bed and onto my mattress.

She was tall and lithe, her jet-black hair falling over her face and all the way to the floor. The only things visible were one unblinking eye, and that smile. She was clad only in a simple white *sari,* without a blouse in the traditional village style. Her bare abdomen was as pale as her face, almost chalk-white. I had heard female monsters and ghosts had their feet twisted around to face backwards, but her bare feet were as normal and unremarkable as mine.

Not that kind of monster, then.

Slowly, she stalked over to the bed. With every step closer, the cold settled deeper and deeper into my flesh. My eyes began to struggle to stay open. Frost was climbing onto my hands and feet now. I tried to open my mouth and scream for help, but my jaw might as well have been wired shut. The only thing that escaped my throat was a pathetic gasp. Even the stabbing warnings in my head had faded to a dull, meaningless roar.

Dimly, I felt her climb onto the bed, straddling me as she leaned closer and closer. Her fingers were colder than I even thought possible, as they gently wrapped around my chin and turned my face to gaze into hers.

“My, my, how you’ve grown.”

Her voice was low and rich, slippery like black ice. I felt my skin burn as frost spread from her fingers. I was practically hyperventilating now, rooted in place and helpless, but even that was growing difficult. My chest refused to rise. Breathing was becoming a struggle.

A losing struggle.

She let go of my face, running her hands teasingly over my biceps. They left a trail of chilling pins and needles.

“Don’t be afraid. I’m not going to kill you. Not for now.”

She placed both hands on my chest, squeezing lightly. Some of the cold withdrew. I could almost breathe again. My eyes flitted between her gaze and the knife on the table. Only if I could somehow get to it…

“Stabbing a visitor? Now, now. That’s so rude.” This close, her eyes were a deep, almost blackish blue, like the dark underbellies of arctic oceans. “If I wanted to harm you, do you think I would have got past the defences so easily? Do you think I would have let you wake up at all?”

My voice was still non-functional, but she must have glimpsed the question in my gaze.

*“Why are you here, then?”*

“Why? To help you, of course. I’m your friend, *Thakur*. Don’t you remember? We’ve been friends for a long time.”

The frost was climbing up my arms, but even through the haze of cold, I recalled a few half-forgotten snatches. A pale face watching from the edge of the wall as I ran around the courtyard. Tossing a ball back and forth with a smiling woman in a white *sari*. Holding a pale hand as I trampled through the family grove.

Had she been this cold then too?

“Good friends correct each other when they’ve been bad.” Almost sensually, she drew herself across me, reaching with a slender hand towards the table and grasping the ring in two fingers. “You know nothing of Chhayagarh’s ways. In many ways, you’re still that little boy, ignorant of the world and its dangers. Only this time, the dangers actually exist, and they want your head. The old things of this world hold no grudges for the innocent transgressions of children. But you are a child no longer.”

She nestled closer, almost lying on top of me as she ran a lazy finger over my brow. Even though it was somewhat reduced, the cold was still barely survivable. An involuntary squeak escaped me.

“Your actions, your presence. They have weight. Meaning. And that makes them both dangerous and attractive. So, when you know nothing about your situation, it’s best to trust wise counsel.” She reached down and grabbed my left hand by the wrist, raising it so I could see as she deliberately placed the ring onto my index finger. “Wear the ring. At. All. Times.” She deliberately lingered on every word. “I believe that is what he told you, darling.”

As soon as it settled on my finger, the cold no longer had a hold on me. The stabbing in my head stopped. I could breathe freely again. Move freely. I tried to snatch my arm out of her grasp, but even at my full strength, she was far stronger.

She smirked at my attempts, continuing in a sultry lilt. “Cute. Your family name, its symbols, have power here. Power earned from a violent history. The things here have learned to fear that crest, even if they don’t fear its holder. It will protect you from the worst of it, until you can protect yourself. Remember that.”

She leaned down and kissed my forehead. Her lips were colder than anything I had ever felt, or probably will ever feel for the rest of my life. Frost spread at a blinding speed from them, growing and thickening until they covered my eyes with a solid, opaque mask.

“Good night, little boy. Sleep well. I’ll be watching you.”

Even blind, I felt her presence shift and leave the room. A few seconds later, the frost over my face cracked, disappearing in moments like quicksilver. The room was back to its normal temperature again, the frost gone. Even the window had been repaired, the pieces held together by a meticulous webbing of ice.

For what felt like years, I lay in that bed. Despite the cool weather, sweat poured freely until the mattress was damp. I tried to cry, but even the tears wouldn’t come. I was too terrified for that.

Then, just as suddenly, I bolted upright and got to my feet. I pulled on a shirt, leaving everything else where it was. Packing and taking the luggage would arouse suspicion.

I had to go. Now.

The house was dark and empty when I left the room, with only the knife in my pocket. The servants were all in the outer part of the manor. Asleep. Only the family slept in the inner bedrooms. Neither my uncle nor my grandmother had been woken by the commotion.

Good.

No one noticed me leave the house. No one noticed as I crossed over the vast estate and silently slid out of the gate. Even the *lathials* were asleep in these wee hours, hugging their sticks to their chests. I had no idea how long it took to walk from the house to the edge of the village. It was a dazed blur. My head was empty of any thought, any instinct, except the feeling that I had to get away. I saw only the road in front of me. I felt only the steady thuds of my feet hitting the ground. I had forgotten to get my shoes. I was still in my house slippers.

Damn it.

A few villagers saw me, mostly young ones out with friends for late-night camaraderie. A few curious looks. But no one stopped or questioned me.

Perhaps they, too, were afraid of the ring. Or it might have been the blank stare.

It only felt like seconds later that the tea shop and the road loomed into view, the familiar pillars opposite it denoting the bus stop. It was not dawn yet, but the sky was beginning to lighten. The shop was still closed and shuttered. It probably would not open for a few days now.

Despite that, the bus driver was outside, sipping tea from a flask on one of the benches. He looked up when I approached. Unlike last time, he was wearing sunglasses that covered his eyes.

“Hey, kiddo. I ended up staying the night. There were no more passengers on the route.”

“Why are you wearing glasses?” I managed. “Something wrong with your eyes?”

He lowered them a little to stare at me, letting me see the inky darkness. “Just a fashion choice. You people are not the only ones who like to dress up. But what about you? Going somewhere?”

“When do you leave?”

He looked at his bus, still parked in the same spot. “In a few hours, I suppose. Why?”

“Take me with you. Take me back. I can’t stay here.” I clenched my fists, nails digging into my palms. “I can’t.”

He looked at me for a few heartbeats. “No.”

“No? What do you mean, no?”

“You can’t leave. Not now.”

“I’ll pay you. How much do you want?” I clenched so hard that the nails drew blood. “Hell, I’ll give you the entire estate if you want. Just get me out of here!”

“Tempting. But you shouldn’t make offers like that lightly. You have no idea of what you may end up giving away.”

“Look—”

“Ssh!” He raised a finger to his lips. “Stop talking. You can feel it, can’t you?”

“Feel what?”

No sooner had the question left my lips than I felt what he was referring to. That sense I was slowly becoming familiar with. Dozens, hundreds, perhaps thousands of eyes. Unseen. All fixed on me.

“The coming of a new *Thakur* is a momentous time. A crucial upheaval, especially in circumstances like yours.” He lowered his hand, taking another sip of the tea. “The land bucks like an unruly horse. Old boundaries, old laws, old understandings, all become ephemeral. They are watching you. All of them. Human and inhuman alike. Getting your measure. If you try to run now… They will know you as a coward. Forever.”

“Better that than knowing me as a dead man.”

He sighed. “You don’t understand, do you? For now, the reputation, the legend around you, keeps the smart ones among them at bay. If you shatter that image, they’ll pounce. You get on that bus with me, and you won’t live to see the next village.”

My heart skipped a beat at those words. “But… you can hold them off, can’t you? Like you did with the Spirals?”

“Maybe. There are many fish in this ocean, and though I don’t mean to brag, I’m one of the bigger ones. But a favour costs nothing. On the other hand, seeking my help yourself? Asking for it when I don’t mean to provide it? That’s a different thing altogether. That kind of support does not come cheap. There will be a bargain, and you won’t like what I take. But even if you agree, even if I help you, even if you escape…” He sipped casually at the tea again. “There will be consequences.”

“That’s what you keep saying.” I wanted to get pissy again, but I remembered the cloaked man’s warning. These things were quick to anger, and slow to forgiveness. “But what do you mean by that?”

“You have no idea of the power you hold, do you? The *Thakur* is not just the lord of Chhayagarh, kiddo. He is its protector. More importantly, he is its gaoler.”

“Protector? Gaoler?” When one asks for an answer, one does not mean to be confused even more by it. But I refrained from making those feelings known to him.

“It is by your strength, your presence, your actions, that this world draws strength against the other one. This village sits on ancient land, where monsters crawl out of the crevices and morasses beyond the veil. It is powerful beyond reckoning, even to existences like mine.” He finished his tea and set the cup aside.

“That is why your family was given this village, young lord. Since your first generations, you have served to stem the tide, to hold fast against the horrors that stalk in the night, to intercede and mediate and solve disputes on the boundaries where the real and unreal collide. Just by being here, you shore up the defences. You keep those who wish to hurt at bay, and you give those who wish to help a focus to rally behind. And you hold up the boundaries that keep them on this land. You disallow their escape. You prevent them from tormenting the rest of the world.”

“Our family? Why us?” I managed to stammer out.

There were a thousand questions running through my mind, but that one came hurtling out before all the others. It was a selfish one. But be honest. Could you really blame me for being angry at being saddled with such a responsibility out of the blue?

“That, I cannot say. But I know it is your sworn duty. You are dam, bridge, and fortress against the other side. If you leave now, when your influence is at its weakest… the walls will break down. Your power will collapse. Your family, everyone in the village, will be left unprotected. And the slaughter won’t stop with them. It will carry on. It will swallow village after village, town after town, city after city. Thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions will die. And death is one of the better outcomes in this situation. There are things that can do worse.”

“Can’t anyone else stop them?”

“There are others, like you, out there. More competent ones. I’m sure they will eventually get it under control. But are you sure you want to be responsible for whatever happens in the meantime?”

I staggered over and collapsed on the bench beside him, burying my head in my hands. I tried to say a million things, but only one choked phrase made it out.

“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do.”

“Go back, kiddo. Get some sleep.”

The sky was beginning to lighten to a faded blue by now. Dawn was coming.

“It was a mistake to come here in the first place. They have smelled weakness. Don’t make it worse by letting them see your tears. The day is safer, especially now that you have the ring. Go back now, before anyone notices you’re missing.” He screwed the cap back onto the flask and rose to his feet, starting towards the bus. “Best of luck. You’ll need it.”

I raised my head, watching his rapidly retreating figure disappear into the driver’s cabin. A few moments later, his head poked out of the window.

“Oh, cheer up. I’ll bring you something nice from my next trip to town. No charge.”

After he drove off, I got to my feet and headed back to the manor. The sun was almost halfway over the horizon when I made it to my room. I tried to go to sleep, but my eyes just wouldn’t close anymore. So, I got back up and typed this out. I can hear people beginning to stir in the house, now that it’s dawn.

I don’t know how much of what the bus guy told me is correct or completely accurate. But in case even a sliver of it is true, I can’t take the chance. There is no way I can leave. At least, not until I figure this place out and stop whatever is hunting us. Both the woman and the driver (I suppose I should call him the ferryman, shouldn’t I?) said that fear of our family keeps the things here in line. Well, whatever this creature is, it isn’t afraid of us.

I have no heir yet. If it kills me too, if no one is left to carry the family line forward…

I don’t know what happens. But it can’t be good.

As I write these last few lines, I can feel a little bit of drowsiness coming back to me. Just as well. I think I’ll sleep in for a bit, and have a late breakfast. Grandmother would be disappointed, but I have little choice in the matter.

After all, I have a long day [ahead](https://www.reddit.com/r/chhayagarh/comments/1fqrllm/index_welcome_to_chhayagarh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

[It was an eventful day too, apparently.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fy1y7k/chhayagarh_the_goat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
