It goes without saying that I spent the next week sneakily showing off this secret console of wonder.  All while ensuring my covers hung like curtains to hide the starman beneath the bed.  Almost everyone got to see the slick console, except Mikey.  I was still pathetically upset that he saw me cry, but I  also knew he was one of the only other kids in the neighborhood with a PS2 at his house.  I never did take him up on that offer to play with his brother’s. All in all, I felt a rift between us.  Entirely my fault, of course, but I didn’t think of it like that.  

Another week came around, and the infinite fun console was no longer fun, and more importantly, I had lost my audience.  Since I was keeping it secret, I only dared play a few minutes with various friends.  So, it was no longer a novelty for the kids to gawk in amazement at.  So, one night, as the soft humming rumbled beneath me, I asked, “Hey, can you make me something no one could be bored of?”

The starman poked his head out from the blanket curtain beneath me, “Of course!  What did you have in mind?”

I thought hard before blurting out, “A dog!” 

No follow-up was needed; he disappeared under the bed.  The green light hummed for a few minutes, filling the room with its ambiance. A grunt, followed by a thud, seemed to signal its completion.  

Out walked the little starman, followed by a dog.  Its skin was a matching spandex silver and texture as the starman’s suit.  Its eyes were hidden behind a similar black tinted visor.  It was definitely bigger than him, though, as it came out from under the bed, its spandex tail wagging, it was up to my knees.  It softly leaped onto my lap, a tongue lolling, sticking out from a cartoony mouth slit hiding the rest of its face.  At first, I was a little disappointed at its appearance, but then it yelped and started licking my face.  I laughed as I wrestled the surprisingly lively little dog.  

I giggled as I held the dog up; it was light, like a plastic toy.  It wagged its tail excitedly as it dangled in my outstretched arms, “I love it! Is it a boy?”  I asked the starman. 

“Of course he is! Pure testosterone!” he hit the authoritative pose, hands on hips, “He will surely be a great companion.”  His tone shifted as he continued, “However, I am afraid to say, my shuttle is rather low on fuel now.  All that energy used by the IMP was needed for my repairs.  I won’t be able to use it, nor power my tools.  If only I could find some fuel on this planet,”  he bent his head, looking defeated.  

I was lured in, “What kind of fuel do you need? Maybe I can find some for you?  My dad has a gallon of gas for his lawn mower in the garage.  Would that work?”

His little head tilted up a little, “No, I am afraid my ship does not use gas.”  He crawled his way up the bed, plopping himself next to me and my new dog, “Sir, can you help me?”

I straightened my posture, “I will try my best,” I attempted to sound like my dad.  

He shifted on the blanket, “I need one of your neighborhood buddies to help.  Only they can provide me with what I need.”

I was confused by the phrasing, “Why can’t I help?”

He paused for a second before answering, “Because you're too special, you don’t have something that all the normal kids have.  I need one of them to get what I need.”

I thought on this, he continued on, “It's so common and trite that they won’t even realize they are helping me!”  He assured, “I just need them under the bed with me.  The rest will come easy to them.”

I looked down at the starman, then turned to the space puppy in my lap.  I remember clear as day, the thought that ran through my head.  *I don’t want this to end*.  

He sat watching me patiently as the gears in my head churned.  Concerns of malicious intent never even crossed my mind.  Only a curiosity of how my friends could help him with his fuel issue, while I couldn’t, “I could help you find fuel…” I muttered, slightly offended.  

The starman patted my leg, “Trust me, it’ll be easier if it's them.”

That aching, vague, unsettled feeling splashed into my stomach again.  I was getting upset when I finally blurted out, “Fine, I’ll see if one of my friends can come over to see you tomorrow.”

“Excellent.  Now, be sure you don’t tell them about me until they’re here.  We made a deal about keeping me sheltered and hidden, right, boss?” He held out his little hand.  I shook it wordlessly.  

I figured this was an excuse to have Mikey back over, so I planned on inviting him as I rolled into bed.  I would try and make things normal between us again, all while ensuring the starman got what he needed for the IMP.  Looking back on this moment, I am ashamed.  The fear of losing this literal genie under my bed overrode my desire to hang out with my closest friend, and I knew that even while planning.  I wanted more toys, more notoriety, and respect from my peers.  I was a horrid kid.  I guess it doesn't matter now, what's done is done.  I was used, and the first of many horrible events was, without my knowledge at the time, teetering over the edge.  And I was about to poke it over.  I wish it wasn’t Mikey, it's awful to say, but I wish I had picked anyone but him.  But I didn’t.  I am sorry, Mike, I would trade myself in a heartbeat now, knowing what I know.  The next morning, I invited him over.
