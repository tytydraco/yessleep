26/01/21 - 4:37PM - GOING HOME

I had just finished work. As I stepped into the train station, the bustling crowd overwhelmed my senses. The sound of announcements echoed off the walls, intermingling with the chatter of commuters. I navigated through the throngs of people, dodging hurried travellers and jostling bags. The scent of coffee drifted through the air, tantalisingly close, but I resisted the urge to stop. I made my way to the platform, and as I heard the whistle blow, I quickly boarded my usual train. I found my seat and let out a sigh of relief, grateful for the comfort of routine amidst the chaos of the city.

??/??/?? - ?:??PM - TRAIN JOURNEY…

I settled into my seat on the train, feeling the familiar rumble of the tracks beneath me. I began to relax, letting out a deep breath and closing my eyes. But as I opened them again, I noticed something strange. There were only 6 other people in the carriage, and all of them were fast asleep, their heads lolling to the side. It was eerily quiet and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of unease.

To make matters even weirder, the normally 5 minute train journey seemed to be taking much longer. I checked my watch, but it had stopped working. When I looked at my phone, I realised that there was no date or time displayed. I couldn’t believe it. Had something happened while I was dozing off? Was I dreaming?

I shook my head trying to clear the fog that had settled over my thoughts. I tried to focus on the rhythmic motion of the train, which rattled like a snake, but my mind kept returning to the peculiar situation. As the train finally pulled into my stop, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief. I frantically stepped off the train, grateful to be back in the word of the awake and aware.

26/01/27 - 4:37PM - WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

I stepped off the train and looked around, but something was off. This was the same train station I had just left, but it was in ruins. The walls were cracked, the ceiling caved in, and debris was scattered everywhere. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Had there been some kind of disaster while I was on the train?

As I checked my phone for any news updates, I realised that the year now displayed 2027. This just didn’t make any sense. I was sure it was still 2023 just a few minutes ago. What was going on?

I turned to see if anyone else had finally woken up and noticed the state of the train station, but the train was nowhere to be seen. It was as if it hadn’t ever existed. My heartbeat quickened, my palms began to sweat and I started to feel like I was losing my mind. I tried to gather my thoughts, but everything was happening too fast. I couldn’t shake the feeling that nothing would be the same again.
