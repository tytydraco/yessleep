It’s been almost 4 weeks since I resigned and sent that email. As far as I can tell, the assistant director of the elderly care facility (ECF) has forwarded my email, but at this point, it’s probably too late. My findings were suppressed, likely due to the potential loss in revenue and the implications of it all.

The email contained a single data.zip file that holds multiple documents. The subject line read, “*You wanted something concrete. Here it is.*” Because I am no longer employed at the facility, I cannot know whether anything came from my many sleepless nights of interviewing, observing, and recording information. And to be honest, the time to act has likely come and gone in the blink of an eye. 

That being said, if my work could end up helping even a single person, it wouldn’t have been in vain. I will trim the fat from the document, and present what I deem most important. If necessary, I will also insert more context and try to be as objective as possible. However, due to the unknown and inexplicable nature of what happened—and is going to happen—some subjectivity is unavoidable. I will give you the facts, and then I'll give you what I saw. The only thing I can do at this point is pray that this *thing* doesn’t spread. 




**August 18th:**

*As her caretakers had arranged, Patty Buckland, an 81-year-old woman, was transferred to our ECF after facing environmental stressors at a previous facility that negatively impacted her quality of life. Our staff were all made aware of her susceptibility to asthma attacks, as well as a chronic pain condition that made it difficult for her to move without proper aid.*

I had a multitude of responsibilities; delivering meals, responding when residents pressed their call buttons, and making sure everyone’s basic needs were met. Most of the residents weren’t very sociable, which made sense; they were put here because their life was reaching its natural conclusion. This wasn’t just a rest stop for them, it was the finish line. 

Patty was no exception. It was clear that she knew where she was, and what this meant. She was in pain, and couldn’t even get up from the bed without assistance. From day 1 her outlook on the rest of her life was grim, and there was nothing we could do but attempt to lessen the pain.

Patty became used to seeing me around, performing my duties. We first spoke briefly about her grandchildren, and then about her late husband. Every word that came out of her mouth was layered thick with melancholy, and nostalgia for times long gone.

  



**August 20th:**

*An unnamed orderly reported finding “ants” in one of the rooms. This was reported to the assistant director, who advised that ant traps should be placed in all rooms.*

I had a brief conversation with Patty, who was in a better mood than the days prior. She was emotive, and she spoke with a newfound vigor that I hadn’t seen before in all of my time working in elder care. It was like a weight had been lifted off her chest, and she could finally breathe again. But with such a stark contrast, I couldn’t stop myself from worrying.

As I was leaving Patty’s room, I noticed a little black dot on her forearm. It was so small that I barely noticed it. I remember her asking, “Is something wrong?” as I inspected the dot. And then it moved, slowly marching up her arm. I’d been told by the assistant director that ant traps had been placed in all the rooms, so I figured the dot on Patty was just an ant.

With a tissue that I had grabbed from Patty’s side table, I picked up the ant and crushed it. Patty winced as I did this. I asked if something was wrong, but she didn’t reply. She let her gaze wander out the window, and the room fell silent. I left shortly thereafter. 

  



**August 24th:**

*Ant traps had been placed in every room. Orderlies and nurses alike repeatedly reported that there were ants in Patty’s room. The traps were checked daily, and all of them were empty as if they were brand new.*

Every Saturday, a projector is set up in the rec room, and a movie night is held, where residents get to vote on which movie is shown. While that is happening, we orderlies clean the vacant rooms. 

I had expected to see Patty in her room, like always, but when I finally got to it, I arrived to find it empty. I couldn’t help but panic. There was no way she could have gotten up and walked out on her own, and surely I would have been alerted if something had happened to her. 

Still fearing the worst, I went to the front desk and asked the attendant if she knew where Patty was. She said that Patty was in the rec room with everyone else. Confusion spread over my face, and the attendant asked if something was wrong. I choked down my worry and told her that everything was fine.

And, sure enough, when I went to the rec room, there she was. She sat at the back of the room, engaged in a hushed conversation with Doris, the woman beside her. I let some of the worry slip away. 

  



**August 25th:**

*Previously, the "ants" were only found in Patty's room, but now they were also spotted in Doris's room. The ant traps remained empty.* 

It was getting to be pretty late in the afternoon, and my shift was almost at an end. I had finished my usual duties, and all that was left to do was clock out. But that’s not what I did.

Patty’s stark change in behavior was seen as a miracle by both employees and residents alike. She was moving on her own again, and her chronic pain condition had all but gone away in a matter of days. I thought that I had to be some kind of pessimist to see Patty’s improvements and not throw my hands up in joy like everyone else. But improvements like that just weren’t possible. You don’t go from bedridden one day to walking on your own the next. 

Before I left the facility, I stopped by Patty’s room. She was lying on her back, lost in a deep sleep. Her window was propped open, and a cool breeze blew through the room. I figured she might get cold, so I moved to close her window. I glanced at her one last time before turning back towards the door. But something caught my eye as I turned. I was sure it must have been nothing, but regardless, I turned back to look at Patty once more, and I saw it.

On her right arm, above her elbow, was a lump. It was small enough to be missed by the doctors who occasionally check up on her, but large enough to be concerning. I felt like calling a nurse immediately, but I wanted to make sure I wasn’t just seeing things. For all I knew, it could have just been a trick of the light. 

With one finger, I pressed against the lump and watched it shift under Patty’s skin. It moved, but it didn’t move freely. As if it was tethered to something inside her arm, it was able to travel from the place I found it and return there once I stopped applying pressure. 

At first, I thought it could have been some kind of tumor, but that theory was quickly thrown out once I felt it for myself. It was hard, almost *rocky.* Some sides had jagged edges that pushed out against the skin, and others were smoother, like a stone that had its points worn away over time. I felt a faint tickle on the palm of my hand and flipped it to find a tiny, black insect slowly marching up my forearm. At first, I thought it was an ant, but upon closer inspection, that idea was thrown out. The bodies of ants are made up of 3 segments, but this insect had 2. It was more spider-like than anything else. I quickly swiped it away and rushed to the front desk.

The overnight staff were alerted, and I was sent home.





**August 27th:**  

*The recurring sightings of small black insects continued. Pressure was put on the assistant director to figure out where the insects were coming from. A multitude of pest control services were contacted, and an inspection of the facility was scheduled.*

The doctors had inspected Patty and reported that there was no lump on her arm. I knew that couldn’t be right, but sure enough, the lump had vanished. No matter how much I thought about it, I just couldn’t find any plausible explanation. Patty’s behavior became stranger as time went on. When I had the chance to speak with her, I couldn’t help but feel like I was speaking to a different woman.

One by one, the other residents changed, just like Patty had. It was uncanny just how similar the timelines were. Like Patty, the residents suddenly felt *better.* They were moving more, interacting with each other more. At first glance, it looked like a miracle had been performed. But I didn’t think so. It had to be something else. 

Repeatedly, I voiced my concerns to the assistant director of the facility, to no avail. I remember them saying, “I cannot warrant investigating our residents because they are feeling better. Get me something concrete, and I’ll look into it. Otherwise, just do your job.”

Whatever *this* was, it was spreading. I could only guess that it spread through direct contact and that it acted fast. The one thing I knew for certain was that it would spread like wildfire in an environment like this.  The last thing I wanted to do was stick around and wait for this to get worse. So I planned to hand in my 1-week notice and collect some more data. If my panicking was needless, then so be it. I could get a job somewhere else. 

That was the plan, at least. Thank god, I didn’t wait.

As I was leaving the facility, I saw a couple paramedics wheeling Patty towards the front entrance. They weren’t rushing, so I thought it would be fine to flag them down and see what was happening. They said everything was alright, but she was being transported to the hospital for observation.

I asked Patty how she felt, and she responded with a whisper. I couldn’t hear her, so I leaned in closer. With a calm tone, she said, “*I feel wonderful*.” Confused, I took a step back. She kept her eyes on me, and that's when I saw it. A group of tiny black insects crawled from one corner of her eye to the other, digging into the soft pink flesh of her tear duct, and vanishing before I could get a good look. 

I was speechless. All I could do was watch as she was wheeled out of the building. My one-week notice was never turned in; I left the elder care facility, and I haven’t been back since. 

I sent the email full of what that I saw, and the dates in which everything occurred. If that fell into the right hands, the spread could be contained. But I'm thinking of this as a virus, and as far as I can tell, it doesn’t act like one.



So my question for you, the reader, is this: 

That bump on your skin; that pimple, ingrown hair, mosquito bite, bruise. Are you sure it is what you think it is?
