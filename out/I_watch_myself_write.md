It was 2 months ago when I first started having nightmares. Although, I didn’t become fully aware of how bad they were until a couple of weeks ago.

All I knew was that I’d wake up in a cold sweat with a feeling like the universe itself was staring at the back of my neck. Goosebumps, hairs raised, and feeling unnaturally cold, especially for these mid-70 degree summer nights with a broken dorm AC and an almost useless fan.

It’s crazy what the subconscious can hide from your mind, whether its intention is to keep you safe or not. At first, when I didn’t know what these nightmares were, I thought it was my brain’s way of coping with my mother’s suicide.

Two years ago, I’d found her lying on the floor, blue-lipped with her eyes rolled back. It hurts to even describe it. There wasn’t even any skin under her fingernails. She just fully committed, not even fighting what I imagine was a long, horrible death. The autopsy revealed her cause of death to be asphyxiation, rather than a broken neck. Although, seeing a scene like that, coupled with the broken length of rope still wrapped around her bruised, misaligned neck, it wasn’t pretty, and it wasn’t hard to piece together what happened.

She hung herself.

My mother, Sandra, was one of those people who radiated kindness and joy. Her generosity was almost comparable to Jesus Himself. She always preached about living your life to the fullest and helping others as much as you could. A true Good Samaritan.

To my knowledge, our family didn’t have a history of mental illness, and my ma had a near-perfect childhood. Of course, there were ups and downs in her life, but never anything so extreme that it would cause her to even have any thoughts like… that. Even when I read her “note” it was illegible. I read and write cursive, and what she wrote… wasn’t that. I’d spoken to her on the phone only a few weeks before, planning our trip to Paris, and she showed no signs of dementia or Alzheimer’s. And she was only in her 50s. Something wasn’t right, but regardless it happened.

Needless to say, when I came home after my first year of college, I was horrified. Actually, I was more than horrified. I just can’t put into words how I was feeling. How I still feel.

I wish I could say that dealing with a loss like that gets better over time, but it doesn’t. Or maybe it’s just me.

I had a hard time dealing with her death. I shut myself off from the world. Became a shut in. I existed in name only. My professors didn’t know who I was. I honestly believe I would’ve dropped out of my college if they didn’t offer online classes as alternatives. The next two years of my life, I lived in a hell I created myself. No friends, no fun, just schoolwork.

Schoolwork, and those fuckass slideshows Apple puts together with old photos from your camera roll that show old memories. As if just knowing the truth wasn’t enough, I was reminded of it constantly. I was always in a bad mood. If I’d even interacted with people, they might’ve considered me bitter. But it was like someone was throwing full-frontal haymakers at my skull every few weeks and expecting me to catch them with a pair of chopsticks.

“Hey, remember when this photo was taken? **Back when Sandra was still alive?**
…
Because we’re sure do!”

Every time I got just busy enough to take my mind off of what happened, whatever the hell that algorithm was would remind me of the void in my life.

But the first year wasn’t that bad, despite what I make it sound like. It was everything I already mentioned above. Or maybe it doesn’t seem bad by comparison. Because last year, it started getting worse.

New slideshows came out with pictures that were just “off” enough to raise concern. In one of the pictures, my mother and I were at a beach in Maryland. I wore my favorite swim trunks and she wore a black dress with red and gold sequins and flowers. It was a beautiful dress, one that I knew she never wore. She said it didn’t fit anymore, even before she had me, and I’d always tell her to get it tailored, to which she declined.

Another picture had us posing in France on one of our vacations. The location read “Versailles, France”, and looking at the photo and using the street view on Google Maps, I confirmed that the location error wasn’t an error. The picture was really taken there.

But really, the only place we visited in France was Bordeaux. Next on our list was supposed to be Paris, but you know what happened. 

Normally you could chalk this up to the two cities being close to each other. Maybe we left Bordeaux and stumbled into Versailles unknowingly. Except, that would never happen.

Even the fastest method of transport between the two cities, by plane, would take at least an hour. There’s no way I *wouldn’t remember* taking a plane ride over there. And if we did, I’m sure we would’ve visited the Eiffel Tower at that point.

A few months after these “blink and you’ll miss it” photos, all hell broke loose. Photos that I never would’ve taken entered these slideshows. My mother hated the ocean. She’d go to the beach, but refused to step foot into the water, so there’s absolutely no way I would’ve taken a picture of her swimming neck deep in the water, waves frozen in time behind her as they readied to bury her head in a watery tomb.

Pictures of us smiling, except the smiles were upside down. A picture of her and her twin sister, dated July 27th, 2023. Her sister had passed away in a car crash pre-pandemic.

A photo of her suicide note.

And I sure as *shit* would never have taken a photo of her suicide “note”. No normal person would. That’s when I really spiraled.

Every few weeks, I’d check that photo, thinking I was missing memories. Surely I would’ve known if I had taken a photo of her note. That’s a pretty big thing *not* to remember. Eventually, every few weeks turned to once a week, to once a day, until I was obsessed with this note.

I checked almost every hour, and every time I did, I’d notice something that wasn’t there. And I *really* mean it wasn’t there. I’d see words in the scribbles for a split second as my eyes scanned over the photo. Words like “snake”, “crack”, “dark”. It made no sense. No correlation whatsoever. Like reading the writing of a madman, except there was no writing.

By the time I got back to the exact spot I looked, there was nothing notable there.

Was this note driving me mad? Maybe I already was. Who else would expect to find something in scribbles like these? Find something in nothing?

I still tried. The same old scribbles, the same old photo, the same old pain. Same old everything. 

Then the nightmares started.

It always started off with me sitting on my bed, staring at my window. I say window because that’s the closest comparison I can make, other than a TV. And it wasn’t anything like a TV. In this window, I saw myself writing. For hours on end. It was saddening to see.

The sun would go up and come down. Entire days would pass by, and I, or I guess the other “me”, would still be slouched over at my desk just writing. Always the same page, there was not a single time that “Me” got up. Not to get a new pen, not to find a new sheet of paper, not even to eat or use the bathroom. It truly was a reflection of my life. The shut in I’d become was showcased in this window to my soul. It was depressing.

The turning point was when I noticed something near the “window frame” watching “Me”. From the far right corner of his room, a set of eyes pried into the back of Me’s neck. If it weren’t for the unnerving feeling of invasive darkness, like a black hole swallowing up light, I never would’ve even noticed that the closet door was cracked open just short of an inch.

It was so subtle I could’ve went multiple nightmares without seeing it. I DID go multiple nightmares without seeing it. Six weeks to be exact. It took six weeks for me to notice this grotesque being.

And once I did, I think it noticed me too.

2 weeks ago was when I noticed that thing. 2 weeks ago was when it started inching closer to Me. It was an appalling sight. At least, from what I could see.

The face was somehow blurred out, like when street lights become just growing circles of light when you look for too long. That’s how it was to look at this thing. Its “eyes”, if you could even call them eyes, were just two dim circles of light. Were its eyes bulging out their sockets? Even though I couldn’t make out any more details than that, I knew the position of its eyes was uncannily far apart.

Something alien.

The eyes were the only facial feature I could make out. I’m sure it had a nose, some teeth maybe, but the face was just too blurry to see. Maybe it didn’t have a nose or teeth, maybe I was laying my eyes upon something so eldritch that this appearance was the most accurate thing my mind could conjure without driving me insane. But at the least, I know that thing had hair. Straight, inky black hair that sucked up light itself. You could get lost in it. And worst of all, it inched closer to Me using only its neck.

*What the FUCK am I looking at?* I’d ask myself in a state of alarming distress. *Some sort of screwed up snake-human hybrid? Did my mind come up with this?*

I couldn’t have. It makes no sense. At least a snake’s body had a “set” size. Whatever this creature that I thought up was, I didn’t know for sure, but I had a gut feeling that it could stretch its neck out infinitely. No human can comprehend infinity. I don’t even know how or why I came to that conclusion. That there’d be no end.

I already knew to give up. No matter how far away I, or Me, could travel, this thing would follow.

It was the type of thing you’d see in a forest, staring at you from yards above. Blending in with the trees until it decides to disappear in them.

The type of thing you’d coincidentally just happen to catch a glimpse of—watching you from right outside of your seat window—trying to fall asleep in the middle of a flight to France.

Always there, always watching.

Steadily inching closer, day by day.

The worst part was that the only times Me looked behind himself, that creature would whip its neck back into the closet at light speed. I’m sure Me felt it too. That unnerving feeling of something watching you. It would’ve been impossible not to. It would explain why the only thing Me did other than writing was occasionally glance behind.

I tried to interact with Me. I’d tap on the glass, even bang on it. Me just stayed writing like he couldn’t hear me yelling and screaming and banging and pleading to just drop the fucking pen and go outside. Just leave. At least *try* to escape. Still, my pleas went unanswered, and this snake-thing came closer.

Last week, it reached the midpoint. It stayed in the middle of the room for the longest time. Like it was taunting Me to look behind. I tried everything I could. I searched my room for anything to write with in the hopes that maybe I could leave a note, since the only thing Me wanted to do was fucking write. Nothing worked. And in my confusion, panic, and despair, I failed to notice an even more horrific truth: that thing was looking at *me* now. Not Me, but me. 

It knew. This entire time, it knew I was watching it. Every realization I had sent chills through me that ping-ponged around my bones until my body in its entirety reverberated with dread. Questions flooded my mind.

For 2 months I had been having this nightmare. And I only realized 2 weeks ago that this thing was there. *For six weeks, who was it really watching all that time? me, or Me?*

I was stuck. Frozen like a deer in headlights. Staring into the “eyes” of some unknowable creation. In that moment, if that thing wanted to get to me, it would’ve. It could’ve started to move at any time it wanted. So why did that thing only start when I noticed it?

It was toying with me. It had to be.

6 days ago, I was still shocked. While I was awake, I examined my dorm room carefully. I became paranoid. I bought a lock first thing in the morning and installed it on my closet door. When I was asleep, I found out that did nothing.

5 days ago, I tried mimicking the hand movements Me did when he wrote. Of course it was illegible. I don’t think it would’ve been readable even if I wasn’t doing this in my nightmare.

But it didn’t hurt to try.

I tried to memorize everything. I came to the conclusion that since I’d noticed little details in the nightmares every time, that meant that I must’ve been remembering things extremely well.

4 days ago, I once again mimicked every hand movement Me did. Awake, this time. I sat at my desk, grabbed a pen, and started writing. I imagined myself as Me as I did this. Even started slouching like he did. Occasionally glanced behind me too, half-hoping I could face this thing head on, half-hoping I wouldn’t see this thing in real life. If helped to better remember the hand movements. What I was left with were just scribbles.

3 days ago, I called multiple people I thought could help with this. Exorcists, paranormal investigators, priests, self-proclaimed witches and magicians, occultists. I almost tried to get into contact with a few cult leaders, but decided that was against my better judgement.

I got calls from each. Some said the earliest they’d be able to see me was in 2 days, others said they’d book a meeting with me for next week. I didn’t think magicians and exorcists were so schedule-oriented.

That snake-man-thing reached the midpoint of the room in one week. I can’t afford to wait another. That thing isn’t going to slow down, and I can’t afford to let it get to Me.

I’m waiting for the ones who said they’d come in two days. The priest came to me today and said something was wrong, but he wouldn’t say what. He barely even stepped foot in my room. I don’t blame him. He said a prayer, then I assume he blessed my room after(?), and left. Told me not to call him back. I still don’t blame him.

2 days ago, bile swelled to the back of my throat.

I had to sit down and try not to vomit and cry or bash my head on the wall upon the realization that my scribbles were *too* similar to my mother’s.

*It’s all scribbles,* is what I tried to tell myself. *Of course it’s gonna look the same.* But not like this.

I looked back and forth between the photo of my ma’s note and my note. Almost a perfect copy. Almost.

I’m going crazy. I can see words in both of the notes, but when I notice them, they’re gone. It’s layers. Words written upon words until the ink itself had enough and blotched everything out. Me never reached for another sheet of paper, he just kept using the same one.

Why did my mom hang herself? Of course I’m upset at the fact that she killed herself. Of course I am! Who wouldn’t be?! But out of all the ways to go, there are more… efficient ways!

Pills, jumping… I don’t even wanna list anymore. 

I’m sorry, ma.

I sound like a dick, comparing my mom’s choice of suicide to my dream phantasm, but was it really a choice? Is there a reason why my mother’s neck of all places… I don’t even know what I’m trying to say. I don’t know. I don’t know. But is there a connection to the monster and how its neck stretches? It’s just I don’t know Idont know But I’m so so scared. I don’t know what’s gonna happen if it reaches me. It’s the not knowing that fucks me up. Or maybe it’s the fact that I have a vague idea alread. I’m sorry ma. I’m scared. Idontknowidonktknwk I’m scaredared scared sorry ma

I’m scared.

I had to take a breather. That’s why it looks like that. I’m not crazy. IM NOT FUCKING CRAZY FUCK! I know what it looks like but whoever is reading this has to believe me.Fuck

I’m going back to our old house, where ma died. Tomorrow is supposed to be the day that thing reaches Me, and if I sit around and do nothing I might die. Hell I might die either way, but at least this way I can say I died trying. This is my way of fighting back.

The occultist is supposed to meet me today, I told her tomeet me at our house. If I don’t update you all soon, yall know what happened. Buying a ticket home now.
