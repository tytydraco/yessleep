“Can we pet your dog?” Two young boys had walked across my new lawn, interrupting my revolving trek between the moving truck and the front door. “I don’t have one, guys.”  
  
“Well, when you get the dog can we pet him?”   
  
“Um, yeah sure,” was my first answer, until I envisioned the kids coming by every day, wearing a dirt path into my lawn, hoping to meet a dog that would never arrive.  
  
The black haired boy all but burst into tears when I said I wasn’t getting a dog, and the blond demanded to know why not. “Look, not everybody wants a dog, okay?” The kids ran off looking spooked, and I groaned realizing that less than a day after moving to town, and at the ripe old age of 34, the local kids would probably see me as the neighborhood’s mean old man.   
  
When Mark introduced himself as the owner of the gray ranch style house across the street, I thought it was an opportunity to repair my reputation. A nice guy, he’d insisted on helping me unload the rest of my boxes and accepted my offer of a cold drink. As we enjoyed the slight breeze, Mark stated that his hometown was a great place to live, but it had its quirks. That sounded like every small town, in my opinion. He admitted that could be true, as he’d never lived anywhere else to compare.   
  
“You may have noticed that there’s an abundance of dogs in this town. In fact, every household has at least one. I myself have two.” He pulled out his phone and pulled up his camera roll full of photos of what looked like two cotton balls with eyes and legs. My eyes were glazing over, but I mumbled that they were cute. He thanked me.   
  
“Here in Donsville, we’ve embraced the saying that dogs are man’s best friend. We live by it.”   
  
I was on edge. “Are you trying to tell me that owning a dog is a requirement for living here?”   
  
“I’m saying it’s in your best interest. You haven’t known love until you have a dog. They’re companions. They’re protectors. They’re unconditional love. There’s a lady over on Washington Ave. who just bred a litter of the prettiest pups you’ve ever seen. I could give her a call, and -.”   
  
Who was this stranger to tell me what was in my best interests? To say that I didn’t know love? I asked him to leave. He continued his sales pitch, and I threatened to physically escort him off the property, in a manner of speaking, if he didn’t go willingly. He made some vaguely menacing comment about how I’d see soon enough, but he did leave, and I went inside.    
  
I almost didn’t answer the knock on the door later, but a quick glance made it clear that it wasn’t Mark. Jada, from next door, introduced herself and apologetically said she couldn’t help but overhear the thing with Mark. She had a couple of cupcakes with her. A peace-offering from the saner contingent of the neighborhood. I gladly took them and she went on her way.  
  
It’s very disorienting to fall asleep in one location and wake up in another. Especially when your new environment is a concrete floor, and you’re handcuffed to a beam. It quickly became clear where I was. From the open garage door, I could see my home directly across the street. There was no telling how long I’d been here, but the warm colors of the sunset had been replaced by a deep evening blue.   
  
The entire street had to hear me yelling that Mark was holding me captive, but not one person intervened. I saw the lights at the little house next door to mine, Jada’s house, flip off. They knew. They all knew, and nobody was going to help me. My back and limbs felt like I had a serious case of road rash. Mark must’ve literally dragged me to his place. How on earth did I sleep through that? My heart sank further. The friendly neighbor with the cupcakes.     
  
Was this really about dogs? Once my wrists and throat were raw from struggling against the restraints and screaming, I made a concerted effort to take deep even breaths. Force and begging weren’t the key to freedom. Maybe reason would work. Keeping my voice as even as possible, I promised to go down and get a dog. Ten dogs. Anything to show my commitment to integrating into the community.   
  
Silence. Then the sound of feet shuffling through leaves. My heart leapt with hope until I saw my new companion. The man looked normal, but more curious than concerned or alarmed.   
  
My stomach lurched, threatening to expel the drugged cupcakes onto my lap, as the man knelt down beside me and used a crusty fingernail to peel a strip of skin off his arm. It writhed like a pale fat worm as he pressed it to my lips. I pressed them shut, and my refusal to ingest the warm flesh enraged him. He his free hand shot forward, entwined itself into my hair and yanked my head backward, then slammed it into the beam. I wanted to scream, but I kept my jaw clenched and settled for a whimper.   
  
Suddenly, my cries were joined by the most high pitched yappy most beautiful sound in the world. The creature’s attention snapped toward the two tiny dogs who’d run into the garage. One of them greedily slurped down the skin strip, then the man peeled off another piece for the second dog. To me, this man was a monster. To the dogs, he was a friend. They danced around him, tails wagging, lapping at the wound on his arm. Once he’d had his fill of puppy love, he walked off into the night. When the dogs turned their affections to me, I welcomed it.   
  
I heard someone else approaching from the house this time. “You’re going to be unsteady on your feet, so don’t try to stand just yet,” Mark said. He sounded genuine, like he hadn’t just kidnapped me and left me at the mercy of I’m not even sure what. He unbound me. I stood, made a pathetic attempt at a punch, then collapsed back onto the ground.  
  
I went on a bit of a tirade about what he’d done to me, and he didn’t disagree with any of it except my point that I could’ve been killed. Apparently, he’d been watching the whole time to make sure it didn’t go too far. “You think it was a coincidence that the dogs ran out just as it started attacking you?”  
  
I maintained that he could’ve just lead with the whole “there’s a monster who lives here and its only weakness is dogs” thing instead of beating around the bush about companionship.  
  
“You’re not the first one to move here. You don’t think we’ve tried to simply warn newcomers? You wouldn’t have listened. You people dismiss us as lunatics and get yourselves killed, and we’re left to clean up the mess. People need to see to believe.”   
  
He had a point, but I still took issue with his methods. Someone could’ve invited me over and let me experience the monster from the safety of their home. He didn’t think I had any right to complain about the way he and Jada saved my life. “I tried the gentle approach, but you weren’t open to even talking about getting a dog. In fact, you were kind of a jerk about it. But I’ll bet you’re ready to talk to Mrs. Gleason about the puppies now.”    
  
The next day, I dropped Jada’s plate off at her place, and she was equally as unrepentant as Mark, by the way. Next, I took a couple of steaks to Mark’s dogs, and he again assumed I wanted him to take me to get one of my own. Now that I was no longer drugged and at his mercy, I spoke my mind.   
  
“With all due respect, no. I appreciate you guys saving my life, and I wish you the best of luck with all this, but I’m not buying a dog and letting it eat monster skin and participating in whatever other crazy BS you’ve got going on here. I’m moving.”  
  
“But you just bought the house.”  
  
“Screw the house. Let it burn”   
  
I stuck to my word and got the hell out of there before sunset.
