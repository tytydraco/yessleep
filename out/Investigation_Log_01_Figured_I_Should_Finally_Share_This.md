I’m… not sure how I should go about doing this. 

I mean, I know I’m supposed to tell my story, explain what happened, but… I don’t know. I guess it’s hard to find a good place to start. I told what I found so far to a friend online, and he recommended this website where you can share stories about weird or paranormal crap, so, here I am.

I think it would be best to start with me moving. I had lived in the country for most of my earlier years, but once I got a job in the city, I had to move closer. That job was the only real reason that I stayed for so long, so when I finally got fired (apparently they found someone “better qualified for the position.” Honestly, I wasn’t that upset. I’d only ever really been a placeholder) I decided to move back into a more rural area. 

I ended up going with somewhere close, but still far from any real cities. It’s a decently sized house, two floors and a basement, on the outskirts of a town called Ash Lake. True to its name, there’s a lake nearby, but most of the town is surrounded by woodland. There’s a small market that sells almost everything, a bakery, and a library, but other than that it’s all just houses and moose.

A lot of moose.

The whole town is in a place called Brimstone County, which itself is located in Manitoba, Canada. It has an ominous name, yeah, but the people seem friendly enough.

None of that is why I’m here though. The reason I’m here is because of something that is decidedly *not* friendly. That part started a few days after I moved in. Everything was going well up until one night, when I heard some kind of… weird screaming, coming from the woods.

It was far away, I could tell that much. They didn’t seem to be getting closer, and whatever was making them didn’t seem to be an active threat, so eventually I just… went back to sleep. They kept happening though. Every night after that, sometimes closer, sometimes farther, but still always… distant, somehow. I’ve never heard them during the day, and nobody in town mentions anything about screams from the woods, so I just accepted it eventually.

Now, I know your first thought about that is going to be that it’s some kind of bobcat or something, but it was no animal I’ve ever heard of that made those sounds. I got a recording of them one night, and they did show up, so I know it’s not just in my head. I would share the recording here, but this forum doesn’t seem to allow audio attachments.

I tried comparing the recording to all kinds of audio libraries and park service websites, and nothing came even *close* to what I had heard. It definitely wasn’t a human, either. At least, I hope it wasn’t. A human that can make those kinds of noises honestly scares me more than any animal, natural or not.

So… yeah. That’s all I have for now I guess. I’ll make more posts if I find anything else, or something new comes up. Other than that, do you guys have any idea what this could be?
