A little backstory,
Me and my friends belive in a lot of folklore creatures. Skinwalkers, Bigfoot, Etc.
We decided to go hunting for some creatures, and that's where it all starts.

•February 18. 2018

The five of us went out to the woods looking for any kind of weird creatures. We were prepared for basically anything. We had shotguns, 9mm pistols, one of us even had night vision goggles. It was around 11pm when we began the hunt. At first it went as you'd expect it. Talking, making jokes, drinking some coke. We didn't expect anything to happen, but after around 2 hours of looking, we heard a kind of noise. Not a noise that you'd tipically hear in the woods. It was like a scream, a non-human scream. It came from far away, but you could hear it like it came from right next to you. We all shivered and shit our pants. Mike (my best friend) asked "Are we sure about this shit? Cuz im kinda starting to shit my pants." Aaron (another friend of mine) sayed "Yeah I'm kinda scared too." But we decide to ignore that and continue. I wish we hadn't. Four of us went first while are other friend, Josh stayed back. After a while we noticed that Josh was missing. We looked for him everywhere, but we had no luck. We called the police and the next day, the "Forever Lasting Search" begun.

The search began, but nothing. We thought he was found when someone blew their whistle. We ran there as fast as we could. They found a shirt, a sock and a shotgun. We knew they belonged to Josh. He had the exact same clothes and shotgun that layed there. We feared the worst. But after 3 months of searching. Nothing was found.

The four of us get a call from the police department. We thought that he has been found. All they told us on the phone was we need to get down to the police department. When we got there, we were greeted by the chief of the police department. He told us that Josh is probably dead by now and they have to call off the search. We were sad, but knew that they did the right thing. Did I say we? I meant my three friends. I couldn't accept that they just gave up on him. So I wanted to search for him by myself.

For the past years, I've been saving up my money for equipment. I've bought a fully automatic rifle, a sniper rifle, night vision goggles, body armour, anything you can imagine. I went out to thoose same woods looking for Josh. After about 30 minutes of searching, I heard that same scream that i did 5 years ago. I went towards it. All of a sudden i saw a head pop out from behind a tree. I didn't even hesitate to shoot at it. At least one bullet must have hit it, because it let out a screamand ran away. That same scream. I was shocked but followed it and what i saw next shook me for life. I didn't have to follow it for long, only for 4-5 minutes. It walked jumped down from a tree while holding something. Then I realised. It was Josh. It was holding Josh. At least what remained of him. It threw him at me, and ran away. I took a look at Josh's body. He was covered in blood. But it was like he was saying something. Whispering. I couldn't quite understand at first but then I realised. He sayed "Run." Next thing I know, that something screamed again. I ran away, but tripped on a rock and lost my concicusness.


•The hospital room

 I woke up in a hospital room with my left leg missing. I heard a voice say "Oh good, you're awake". It was the doctor. He sayed screams were heard from the woods so they send police officers to check it out. They found me, missing a left leg. I looked at my body and saw scratches and bite marks all over me. I asked him what all that was about. He sayed he did not know. So here I am in a hospital room, writing, hoping that someone belives me. And as for Josh, they recovered his body too. At least his head. Nothing else was to be found. And it remains a mistery, that what was the thing that killed Josh and almost killed me.
