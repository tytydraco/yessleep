I came to this house seeking refuge, looking for somewhere to hide from myself. The townspeople warned me, their eyes flickering with unspoken fears. They spoke in hushed voices about the place, a crumbling relic haunted by darkness, by acts too sordid and terrible to name. But I needed to escape my world, and this forsaken house, with its decaying walls and twisted history, seemed like the only answer. 

From the moment I crossed its threshold, I felt the weight of the house pressing down on me, heavy and oppressive, like a living thing breathing in the shadows. The air was thick with the scent of rot, infused with something else, something organic, like burned flesh or spoiled meat. I told myself it was just mold, just decay, but doubt donwned at me. 

And then I saw them. 

Faint at first, tiny, fleshy blobs on the walls, like swollen cysts or blighted insect eggs. They pulsated irregularly, as if breathing in a rhythm all their own. I tried to ignore them, but they seemed to pulse with my heartbeat, responding to my fears and curiosity. Night after night, they grew larger, their surfaces crawling with tiny veins and sickly hair-like filaments that wove across the flesh’s slick surface. 

The whispers started softly, almost tender, secret confessions in a voice I couldn’t deny was coming from the growing masses. They spoke of sins, of crimes committed long ago by those who had lived here or perhaps even by me. I could hear their voices telling stories filled with violence, lust, madness, acts so depraved I wanted to drown in shame. 

They said the flesh was alive; more than organic, more than mere growth, they claimed it was an ancient consciousness, a living archive of human filth. I trembled as I watched it ripple and squirm, as if yearning to escape its prison of flesh and bone, to reach out, to touch me. I could feel its hunger, like a parasite craving more than just blood but my very soul. 

I began to carve into it, my trembling hands clutching a rusted knife I found in the attic, scraping and slicing at the slick, pulsating surface. I wanted to shape it, bottle its grotesquery into art, into something beautiful I could control. But the flesh refused. It responded with pain and lust, twitching violently as I cut, seeping a thick, dark ichor that smelled of rotten meat and something else something indescribable, primal, and sickening. 

Every incision seemed to make it more alive. It grew and rippled with a sickening energy, tendrils of malformed skin stretching to touch my flesh, brushing softly against my arms and neck. I could feel it beneath my skin now, a crawling, writhing presence, whispering promises (are they promises?) of power, of surrender, of becoming one with its obscene beauty. 

The whispers grew darker still, more blasphemous telling tales of the house’s previous occupants, who had fallen into madness and depravity. They had succumbed to the flesh, losing their identities, becoming part of its horrible tapestry of sins. They begged me to join them, to give in, to become nothing more than a sculpture of flesh, a monument to darkness. 

I couldn’t resist. Every night I pressed my hands into the pulsating mass, smearing my blood into it, desperate to leave my mark, to shape this abomination further. I carved sick, twisting symbols, grotesque shapes, and obscene faces, each one more disturbing than the last. My reflection in the mirror grew ghastly, eyes hollow, fingers stained with gore, a creature emerging from its own horror. 

The more I tried to fight it, the more I realized: this wasn’t an ordinary infestation. It was ancient. It was alive with a will of its own, born from centuries of human sins: killing, raping, murdering, all soaked into its putrid essence. It feeds on the desire and guilt of those who enter there, growing stronger with every secret they hide, every shame they conceal. 

It whispers to me, urging me to surrender completely. To give it my flesh, my blood, my soul. I can’t tell if it’s the flesh itself talking, or the madness inside my own mind. My thoughts coil around each other like the tendrils of the creature, sticky and thick. I feel my sanity fraying, unraveling at the edges, as I become more entangled in its web of filth and horror. 

Sometimes, I catch glimpses of the past, shadowy memories of people who lived and suffered here swallowed by the living flesh. They are now part of its obscene tapestry, eternally trapped in orgies of violence and desire. I see them in my nightmares: hunched, screaming, clawing at the flesh that claims them, only to dissolve into their own decay. 

I’m losing myself. 

Every night, I hear the whispers clearer, more insistent. They tell me I belong to the house now, a piece of its sick gallery. I feel the flesh crawling under my skin, eager to seep into my bones, to replace what’s left of me with its hideous beauty. I am terrified I will never break free and yet, I find myself addicted to the sickness of it, hypnotized by the grotesque allure. 

The house, the flesh, the whispers, they’re one. And I am no longer sure if I am a man or just a sculpture, just an echo in this chamber of depravity. My mind is a shattered mirror, fragments of sanity scattered among the pulsating, living mass. 

And I know this: They will never let me go. The flesh whispers that I am theirs now and that I’ll be part of its endless, filthy gallery forever.
