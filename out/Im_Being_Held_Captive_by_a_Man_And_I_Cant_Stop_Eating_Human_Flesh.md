Jones had found a skeleton in the cupboard of the other bedroom, with a set of notes written on bloodied paper, nestles in the deceased’s ribcage. The writing was haphazard; barely legible. From what I could figure out, is written as follows: 

“Blood was all I could taste in my mouth. A metallic copper that’s only reminiscent of a curious lick to a wound. My gums were so sore, and I hurled my body to the side to relieve my lungs of the pressure my breasts had crushed out of me prior. Agonising pain in my stomach. Something I’d never felt before. At least, in the sense that ‘I’ was a being, experiencing pain.

I had no idea where I was, who I was. The room was dim, dank, spare for the sole light that flickered from a useless number of cinnamon scented candles that were no more than inches from my face. I could only discern them by how disgusted I was from the smell, reminding me of something I couldn’t remember. It was as if a blank slate stood in my mind, and all I knew was I despised the scent. 

There was a knock at the door of the room, and a small, quiet voice said:

“I’m coming in.”

A man entered. One I’d never seen before. He was certainly smaller than me, when I compared his shins to my own. He was thin, very thin; black hair roughed his features. A beard and long hair, down to his shoulders, but curled in a greasy and unkempt manner. A word stuck out to me: Asian. 

I didn’t even know what the word meant, along with multiple silly nothings that swarmed my head. What the fuck is a guitar?

He’d kicked a bowl of clear liquid toward me. 

“You should have water. It’s good for you.” He smiled out, but his face was full of regret. His eyes barely spent more than a few minutes on my figure before he turned on his heel and left. I didn’t blame him, the stench in the room from my inability to cleanse myself would be enough to turn any head. I’d soiled myself multiple times. I’d been kept here for hours, days perhaps. 

I tried to drink it, but I hurled; spewing the clear liquid back up the moment it hit the pit of my stomach. He came back in, sorrowfully, and combed my hair with his fingers. 

“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” He’d said a name I didn’t recognise - but it was feminine. It resonated with me, but I didn’t care for it. I felt like a pet.

This shtick happened for multiple days. I assume they were days, seeing as I had no means to keep time. The man would come, speak to me as if I knew him, and then leave once I couldn’t give him what he’d wanted. I assume recognition, or appreciation. He was nothing to me, bar the torture of my gut. 

Then, he came down with a cut on his lip. The smell that emanated from it was divine - like sweet honey dripping from his mouth. I went feral, and suckled it. He seemed pleased by what I’d done, pushing his tongue against mine. I tried to fight it off, merely licking at his cut. He pulled his penis out, and I screamed. It was a different smell; a bad smell. He stopped, put it back into his clothing. I was terrified. Of him. Everything that could look like him. But mostly, myself, for being so insatiably hungry.

“You don’t remember, do you.”

I looked at him incredulously. How was I supposed to know who he was? I’m stuck in this room, and all he brings me is water. When his blood is so sweet, how can I live without it? Why does he want to sexualise me when I am no more than desperate for his flesh?

His flesh.

Oh dear God.

I scratched at my neck all night, wishing my thirst for blood would leave me. I did not even know him, yet his body was all I craved. His blood, his heart, his mind. 

I couldn’t take the cravings. I scratched at the door endlessly, my fingertips molten to the bone. I didn’t care. I needed his flesh and blood.

He came down eventually, giving me his time. He introduced himself as ‘Greg.’ Said we knew each other from a past existence. I didn’t care. Nothing mattered bar the desperate need I had for his taste. 

“I need to eat you.” I’d said, before I could stop the words from unfurling from my mouth. He didn’t waver, however, and pulled his wrist out from his sleeve; baring it for me so I could sink my teeth into his green veins. 

Such a delicious taste. Like bloodied steak, or fried chicken. Perhaps something none of you would be able to comprehend. He’d nested his head in my neck, crying out in pain, but simultaneously kissing my skin. 

Disgusting.

He ogled me like I was something to stare at, whilst also wincing at my figure. As I drank, he fondled my body, touching my midriff tenderly. Like I would break any given moment. 

That was an unfair assumption. I have no midriff. Bone and flesh tangled together in an abnormal way; specifically now I know what human is supposed to look like. My bones creak with every moment. They itch - a tickle from the air against the marrow. 

“Don’t touch, please.”

He stopped, whipping his hands away. As if he’d touched acid. Horrified at his own actions.

“I’m sorry.”

He left again, closing the door behind him. I stood up, prancing about the room. It felt nice to dance around a bit, trailing my fingers around the place. The door was locked, but I still yanked a bit. Sung tunes to songs I didn’t know the name of. 

Brain like soup. My words spilt from my mouth like the terms in my head were almost desperate to pour out. Blah? Blah Blah. And I screamed. 

That feels nice, huh? Screaming. Screeching and wailing. Banging on the walls. I had some strange feelings bubbling inside me. Hot, vicious anger. But anger for what?

I screamed until my lungs burned. Slamming my body against the locked door. Begging to be let into humanity - society. Gagging for release. Desperate for flesh. I hated myself. Something was so wrong. My body wasn’t like his - it was broken; my legs were open and flayed, the bone beneath my knees prevalent.

He came back downstairs, and I crawled into my corner once more; apologetic. I didn’t want to upset him, even though he was ever so calm. He looked at me, with pure pity, and he asked me:

“Moira… Do you really not remember?”

Remember what? All I know is this strange man has trapped me here - forced me to feel pain as I rot on this mattress he’s left me. But I beckon him. He clearly knows, and feels, something for the body I host, despite it not being the person inside that he so desperately wanted it to be. Maybe it was contractual in that respect; him offering me his flesh as I offered my warmth.

“What did you do to me?” I screeched, tearjng at my hair. Clumps of blonde curls fell into my fists with ease, as I squealed until my voice was hoarse. He simply looked at me with sickly lovingness, grasping my clenched fists with his own. He twirled the hair between my knuckles indignantly.

“I’ve missed you so much.” He said, annoyed, as I chewed off his pinky finger. With each crunch of a knuckle, he never flinched, staring with admiration at me. I suppose if he didn’t mind, then neither did I. “Is that what you needed?” He chuckled, eyes growing darker with each suckle. “I suppose I should’ve expected that. Nothing comes easy with the devil.”

I recoiled. Speaking that name made my skin singe. A name that I shouldn’t know, yet I knew all too well.

“I love you, Moira.” He said, allowing me to consume his arm. I had no idea my mouth could unhinge in such a manner, allowing me to python-like consume his arm. He never cared as his arm was reduced to a stub.

“I’ve done so much to keep you, Moira.” He said as I gnawed on his skull, swallowing clumps of hair. I was ravenous. I cried as I did what I did. 

“It was all my fault, Moira.” He kept saying, until my teeth clawed at his skull and let me into his brain. I was so, so hungry, and I couldn’t help myself. He babbled incoherently, as I consumed him. Eventually his eyes went dead, and my stomach was full. He’d held my waist through the whole process, and only once he’d passed did I reconcile with what I’d done.

I didn’t feel ill. Just horrified. I’d consumed his entire brain, and his face was contorted into a serene smile. Unwavering love. It horrified me. I stared into his glossed over eyes, and saw myself. A zombie. The undead, mottled skin and no midriff. He’d made me be here, like this, to suffer.

I stumbled through the house. Maybe better to call it a flat. I don’t know where I coined the word from, but it felt right. I crept in the dark, the dread in my stomach causing me to feel like I’d done something wrong. There was a room that smelt wrong - raw meat that had been left in the sun, or something similar. But I was so endlessly hungry. I needed to feast.

I entered the room. Pictures of a woman, with blonde hair and brown eyes littered the walls. She was pretty, and I felt some strange kinship with her. The man who’d served me was in a lot of them, but far healthier looking. Happier. No more were the scruffy black hair, but a face clean shaven - clean. Clean. 

There was a man on the bed. Dead. With long limbs and decayed meat. Flesh. I tried a taste, but it was rancid. Old and rotted. His insides had been torn out, splayed in a star-like shape. He must’ve been there for weeks. For some reason, I felt bad for the corpse before me; some untold innocence I’d never understand. 

I went back down into the basement, and ate the rest of the man. Bones picked clean, with the marrow suckled out. Yet, I was still hungry. Insatiably hungry. I can’t stop myself. I’m writing on a computer in the room I found the other man in, that was left unlocked. I think the girl in the photos on the wall is me, but I’m not as pretty anymore. My body is broken and scared; crooked from the waist upward. But I’m so hungry, and I can’t stop it. I can’t quench it. I need to eat. 

I feel like I should be sorry, but I’m not. I’m too hungry to care.”

Jones spewed all over the carpet. He’s a newbie, so is as expected. I’ll update when I can.
