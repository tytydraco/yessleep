I’ve heard it said, both in media and to me personally, that the only way to get over a tragedy is to confront it. In truth, I’ve never understood what that means. To me, tragedy is a scar; raw at first, but it fades until you almost forget it’s there. Until something brushes against it, and the pain flares up again.

Losing my father was my first scar. Eight years have dulled it into something I can manage. A pain I can ignore. The scar my mother left was the deepest, and still fresh. She was the kindest person I’ve ever known, and now the house she left me is unbearably quiet. Two weeks isn’t enough time for this silence to feel normal.

I don’t plan to stay here. I want this to fade as quickly as possible. I want to bury it under time before I can dwell on it. 

But first, I’ve been going through the attic; boxes of photographs, toys, and things I don’t remember owning. The place feels almost sacred: cedar beams draped in cobwebs, dust glittering in shafts of light, every box a nostalgic mystery until I open it.

I find old memories in these boxes. Drawings of my family I had scribbled as a child; poor depictions of my father with his coat and his bowtie, my mother’s long, dark hair and warm smile reduced to dark crayon smudges. And more tangible memories too; faded birthday cards in my mother’s handwriting, broken toys neatly stitched, her hand in every seam. It’s bittersweet, like watching a home movie about someone you love. Beautiful, but it hurts because you know it’s over.

But there was one box in that attic that didn’t give me this same warm, sweet sadness. This box made me itch in a way I couldn’t scratch. A memory pressing at the edges of my mind but refusing to surface. 

Placed neatly at the bottom of a collapsing cardboard box, waiting for me to find it, was an old VCR cassette. 

It’s what’s making me write this post. I’m hoping someone out there will be able to fill in some gaps for me.

I know this may be a bit of a niche ask, but does anyone know of the show, “Liewe Heksie?”

The first thing I saw was my mother’s handwriting on the box, on a yellowed strip of scotch tape:

*“All is well in Blommeland”*

Seeing it dragged me straight back to childhood like a riptide.

For those who don’t know, *Liewe Heksie* was a somewhat educational children’s program in South Africa that ran from 1978 to 1982. It began on the radio, but by the time I was a child, I knew it from the television adaptation that used puppets.

The title translates to “Beloved Little Witch,” and she was the star. Her name was Livinia, a happy but scatterbrained little witch with a pointed hat who lived in Blommeland (“Flowerland”), a painted kingdom of cardboard castles, bright flowers, and felt puppets. She went on lighthearted adventures with her fairytale friends, and could never remember the words to her own spells. It was sweet. Wholesome, even.

My mother never missed it. Even when she was busy, she’d linger in the doorway until the theme song finished.

I remember it playing on humid summer mornings, the curtains breathing in and out with the wind through open windows as the sun baked the reddish ground outside. My mother would hum softly in the kitchen while the smell of boerewors, eggs and toast drifted through the house. Hadadas shrilled from the trees outside, sometimes drowned out by the sudden drumming of rain on hot tar. I’d sit cross-legged on the carpet, tracing patterns in the weave while the TV crackled, safe in the rhythm of it all: my family, our house, the little witch chattering from her make-believe world.

My mother would often check on me, like she wanted to be sure I didn’t miss anything.

That’s the way I’ve always remembered it; warm and comfortable.

But the more I look through those boxes in the attic, the more things I find that don’t fit my rose-tinted memories. Tiny shirts and socks I know I’ve never worn. A card in my father’s handwriting addressed to “my two little ones.” A crayon drawing of a family of four holding hands.

I’m an only child.

There was one particular box that was heavier than the rest, and I already knew what it held. 

I dusted off the VCR player and coaxed it into life. The machine gave a low hum, then swallowed the cassette with a heavy clunk. My television is almost brand new, a gift from last year, but when the screen flickered from static to black, the air tingled as if I were back in front of my parents’ old box set, the ghost of its static still alive in the room.

A tiny burst of music filled the room; the Liewe Heksie intro. I hadn’t heard it in decades, but the tune was instantly familiar. And then she came into frame just like all those years ago. A happy little woman with a pointed, black hat. She smiled and waved with her friends as a choir of disembodied children’s voices sang the theme song. The puppets bobbed stiffly in time with the music, their felt mouths fixed in wide smiles.

I almost smiled too. For a moment, it was exactly how I remembered it. For those few seconds, I felt like I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet again, tracing shapes on the floor with my finger while my dad sipped his coffee.

The theme song ended and the title card flickered across the screen, its colors a little more washed out than I remembered. Then the picture steadied, and the familiar sets of Blommeland came into view; bright painted flowers and a miniature fairytale castle. It was exactly the kind of stage I used to lose myself in. Simple, happy and safe.

On his throne beside the Silver Rose sat Rosekrans, the fretful King of Blommeland. His velvet tunic bright against the backdrop, a simple gold crown perched on his head, his painted face set in its usual worried expression. He was always warning that if the Silver Rose was stolen, all the flowers in the land would die. I remembered this scene. Him ordering Heksie’s friend Blommie the elf to guard the Rose while the evil elves schemed in the shadows outside the palace.

But then his tone shifted. Heksie had asked if she could help guard the Rose too. He leaned forward, his unblinking eyes fixed on Heksie.

*“Yes, they need to be together,”* he said. *“If they’re apart, the Rose will be stolen.”*

Neither puppet reacted, just bobbing their heads obediently.

The scene carried on. The bad elves scurried and plotted, Heksie bumbled along as always, and the story moved toward its usual happy ending. But I barely followed it. I felt an unease I can’t remember feeling before. And it felt so wrong. This was a part of my childhood, how could it feel bad?

I thought about stopping the tape, but the VCR hummed steadily, and the flicker of the screen held me. By the time I’d made up my mind, the next episode had already begun.

Heksie was painting the roof of her house. The king had ordered all of Blommeland to do the same because the Fairy Queen was visiting, and he wanted everything to look beautiful for her arrival. Heksie’s friend, Blommie, was calling for her from the ground. 

But the sound changed. The tape slowed. The scene became desaturated, like the color had been muted. Blommie’s voice stretched and deepened, dragging out like something caught in the machine.

*“…wheere… are… you? …wheere… are… you?...”*

The screen jittered, then lurched forward. The sound snapped back to normal and the color came back, but several minutes of the episode were gone.

I worried the tape itself was damaged, another fragile piece of childhood about to be lost. But when I rewound the scene, it played normally.  I took it out to inspect it for damage, but I didn’t find any.

What unsettled me wasn’t the distortion itself, but how it snapped back to shape. It didn’t look like static, or like any other glitch I’d seen. It was smooth. Almost natural.

It felt less like damage and more like correction. Like something catching itself mid-fall.

I thought about popping the cassette back in, but it was late. I returned it to its bulky plastic protector, set it in the box, and went to bed.

I left it in the box that night and tried to focus on other things. Even with the morning sunlight shimmering through the windows, the house was still too quiet. Every room felt hollow without my mother’s voice filling it. I made tea just to have the sound of the kettle boiling, the hiss of steam, anything to cut through the silence.

For a while, I sat at the kitchen table paging through some old letters I’d found in another box. Most of them were boring; receipts, lists, reminders. But even in those, I could see her handwriting, careful and looping, the same way she used to write notes for me to take to school. It was comforting. I’d stumbled into a pocket of normal life that the attic hadn’t soiled yet.

Still, my mind kept wandering back to the cassette. The way the King leaned forward, the dragging voice on the roof scene. The more I told myself it was nothing, just a warped tape, just my imagination, the more it refused to leave me alone. I thought about throwing it out altogether, but the idea never made it past my hands. It was the only thing that felt like it held an answer to whatever it was that was making me feel so strange. If I watched long enough, surely things would settle back into what they were supposed to be.

That was when I noticed something else that didn’t quite fit. I couldn’t remember my mother ever keeping letters in the attic before. She used to store them downstairs, within reach, where she could keep an eye on them. She had always liked knowing where things were.

And all the while, that same elusive memory pressed harder at the edges of my mind, like it was waiting for me to turn the next page, to put the cassette back in.

The next box I opened was in shambles, its corners soft with age.Inside were scrapbooks, each page carefully labeled. Birthdays. Christmases. Holidays in Durban. It was comforting, seeing those years laid out like a timeline. I let myself believe this, at least, would look the way I remembered.

It didn’t.

In some photos, there was space where there shouldn’t have been: a gap on the couch, a chair pulled slightly too far from the table, my mother’s arms positioned in an awkward loop around the air in front of her. It was as if the film had simply forgotten what should be there. And her captions never named me. They just said things like “the kids” or “our little ones.”

The gaps weren’t empty, not really. In the older photos, there were smudges in the film. The kind of fading you’d expect after years in storage. But as the pages went on, the shapes grew darker. More defined. A tall, thin blur that clung to the edges of the frames, always just in view.

Then I turned one page and froze. Christmas. I was smiling on the floor in front of the tree, clutching a new toy. I could see the reflection of the window behind me in the glossy paper. It was faint but clear, and something was standing there with me. Too tall to be my parents. Too crooked to be a trick of the light.

My throat tightened. I slammed the scrapbook shut and shoved it aside. But the image didn’t go away with it. My body locked up and I was suddenly certain there was something behind me. There had been something there this whole time, close enough that my shoulders tensed in anticipation.

But nothing touched me.

I snapped the book closed and stood too fast, nearly knocking over the box. I pivoted back and forth, scanning the dim attic. Shapes seemed to shift in the corners, shadows clinging to the beams, crouching among the spider webs. The air felt too close, too heavy, the dust swirling like it had been stirred by something.

Nothing was here.

I stood there anyway, heart pounding, until the feeling ebbed. Until the attic was just an attic again.

But even as I tried to convince myself, my hands kept drifting toward the box. The cassette had been lodged in my thoughts since I found it, like a song I couldn’t stop humming.

And of course, I went back to it, scrapbook tucked under my arm.

I let the cassette play on, half-watching as episodes blurred together; three, four, five, all the way through eleven. They were just as I remembered them: clumsy adventures, Heksie bungling her way through spells, Blommie sighing in exasperation. Nothing was out of place.

By the time the twelfth episode began, my guard had dropped.

Heksie was gardening - planting her flowers upside down by mistake. Kwaaitjie laughed at her before asking her for a favor. He was tasked with delivering a message for the king and needed Heksie to look after his baby brother. I remember this episode vaguely.

But not the child. Small, with oversized felt hands and a round face. I had no memory of this puppet, let alone in this episode. I could have sworn Heksie was supposed to help deliver messages with Kwaaitjie with her broom.

Heksie tucked him into bed, singing him an off-key lullaby while the child doll closed its stiff eyelids. 

When Heksie wandered off and forgot about him, I felt a flicker of unease. She went to Blommie’s house who scolded her for forgetting her responsibility. They hurried back to find an empty bed. 

I felt the blood leave my face, but I had no idea why my body was reacting this way.

The scene jumped abruptly to Heksie flying through painted skies, calling in a voice far too angry for her character, 

“Where are you? You must come out now.”

The call carried none of her usual playfulness, it sounded like an order.

 And though she was looking offstage, it felt like her glassy eyes were fixed on me.

When the child was “found,” tucked safe in another room, the mood shifted back to its usual happiness. He had never left the bed, Heksie had simply checked the wrong room. 

As the explanation settled, the jitter smoothed out. The colors brightened again. Only at the edge of the frame did the darkness remain, thin and patient, as if it had always been there and now no longer needed to hide.

When the king asked Heksie what had caused the commotion that day, her voice was distorted and drawn out,

“We forgot.”

The word settled heavily, and the room felt finished with it.

That feeling of unreachable nostalgia had never been stronger, as if my thoughts were locked behind iron bars. I flipped through the scrapbook, faster now, as if momentum might force something loose.

Every picture told the same story. My father holding me. My mother beside us. And always the same wrongness. Her arms curved around empty space. 

I turned the pages until they blurred together, until my eyes grew heavy with the strain of reaching for something just out of reach.

At some point, I must have dozed off at the table, the scrapbook still open beneath my arm. My dream felt softer than usual, like it was illuminated by the same pastel skyline I had been staring at on the television.

My father was there. Whole, as I remembered him before the accident. I could even smell the aftershave he used. It was one of my favorite memories of him. The day he taught me to throw a rugby ball. We passed it back and forth until I learned how to spiral it through the air. I remember the pride and love so clearly visible on his face. For a while, I believed it. Believed I was really in this moment again.

Then the sky dimmed.

Not all at once, just enough that the colors thinned, the edges of the scene losing their certainty. My father’s features blurred next, smudging at the corners as if the dream could no longer hold him together. His words cut off mid-breath, breaking into silence.

Something remained in the background where the horizon had been. Tall and thin. Not moving closer, but filling the space the scene had lost.

I tried to reach for him, to see his face again, but the effort only made the image falter further.

I was jolted awake by singing. I was back in the chair with the scrapbook, the TV screen illuminating the room and greeting me with this;

Video. 

I sat up and reached for the remote to turn it off, but the scrapbook slid off my lap, pages spilling open across the floor. The Liewe Heksie intro blared in the dark room, bright and cheerful, impossibly loud in the quiet house.

I stared down at the open pages.

My father’s photo, the one I had studied only hours earlier, was ruined. He was unrecognizable, his face just a pale blur on the yellowed page.

It struck me then that the dream hadn’t ended when I woke up.

It had finished. Something had been taken, and the space it left was already closing.

The next episode loaded on its own.

*Liewe Heksie’s Birthday.*

Heksie was seated at the end of a long table, surrounded by kabouters in paper hats, their voices raised in song. A cake sat between them adorned with brightly colored wax candles. But it wasn’t her celebration.

When the singing ended, she began to cry, the puppet wiping its own painted eyes. When Blommie asked her what was wrong she admitted she’d never had a birthday of her own. She didn’t know when she’d been born. Her friend pitied her, and came up with a plan.

Birthdays were important. Everyone knew that in Blommeland.

After some murmuring, he suggested she could simply choose one. Heksie considered this for a while before announcing happily that her birthday party would be April 24th, and everyone was invited.

Once everyone agreed, the mood lifted. A cake was brought back out. Presents were handed over. The disruption smoothed itself away.

For a moment, I felt that nostalgic childhood warmth again.

When the day came, there was a party. Gifts, cake, laughter. Heksie was radiant.

It wasn’t until she mentioned having another birthday the following week that the confusion set in. Voices rose. Someone said that wasn’t how birthdays worked. Others pointed out the gifts, the cake, the trouble they’d gone to, and how Heksie had tricked them by lying about her birthday.

The presents were taken back. The celebration collapsed into something brittle and awkward.

I remembered this part.

Karl Cat was supposed to defend Heksie. He would tell the crowd that witches have the special ability to choose when their birthday is. The music was supposed to swell then, light and apologetic, ushering the scene toward its lesson. The kabouters would forgive her, and the party would resume as the credits rolled. That was how the episode went.

But none of that happened. The music didn’t pick up, the argument didn’t go on.

One moment the kabouters were still standing there, hands hovering over reclaimed gifts, and the next they were already sitting down. The presents were back on the table. The cake was centered again, candles straightened. No one acknowledged the change.

The scene held longer than it should have.

Heksie sat smiling at the table, dark hair framing her painted face. Karl Cat was beside her, his red bowtie neatly fixed. Across from them, a smaller figure clutched a stuffed bear, feet not quite reaching the floor.

They sat exactly as the scene required, arranged with the same care as the table and the cake.

Every seat at the table was filled. All but one.

An empty wooden chair, pulled slightly back, as if waiting for someone who hadn’t arrived yet.

And suddenly the touch I’d imagined earlier in the attic wasn’t a threat at all.

For weeks I had been struggling to remember, and this felt familiar. 

The scene wasn’t waiting for me to understand. My struggling hadn’t been the point. Remembering or understanding wasn’t the point. It was waiting for me to agree.

I realized my own hands were clenched in my lap as my eyes moved from the screen to the box that had started this. To the tape on the box that my mother had so meticulously placed all those years ago.

In her neat handwriting,

*“All is well in Blommeland.”*

I stared at it for a long time.

It was not reassurance, nor was it even kindness. This was a rule, a contract, and I had followed it to the letter without realizing it.

Nothing was wrong in Blommeland.

Nothing was allowed to be.
