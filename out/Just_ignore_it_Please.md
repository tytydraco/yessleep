I live in complete isolation. Everyone who once knew me ignores me—they act like I don’t exist anymore. It started a few years ago, back when I was in college. At first, it was subtle. No matter where I went, I felt something watching me. Occasionally, I’d catch someone staring at me—never blinking, never looking away. But every time I noticed them, my day would spiral into disaster.

One morning, I woke early and glanced out my window. A fox stood in the field in front of my house, staring directly at my front door, completely still, as if it were waiting. At the time, I thought I had witnessed some rare, magical moment. But that day became one of the worst of my life.

On my way to work, I crashed my truck into a ditch. It wasn’t totaled, just cosmetic damage, so I had it pulled out and continued to work. When I arrived, three of my customers had canceled their orders. Three might not sound like much, but in the airplane industry, when you work on commission, that’s an entire month’s paycheck gone. When I left work, I slipped, fractured my arm, and by the time I got home, my house had nearly caught fire. I brushed it off as a streak of bad luck. We all have them, right?

Then, a few weeks later, my brother called me out of the blue. He told me his best friend had just been diagnosed with a terminal autoimmune disease—he didn’t have much time left. That’s when I realized something. The day before, we had been out in town, and my brother had pointed out a strange man following us through the mall. When he tried to confront him, the man simply disappeared into the crowd, as if he had never been there at all. I told my brother to just ignore it.

A few nights later, during a family cookout, my father mentioned seeing something standing in the woods. A black figure, unmoving, watching us from about seventy feet away. I told him, Dad, please… just ignore it.

The next morning, I tried calling him, but his phone had been disconnected. That evening, I got a call. While working on his breaker panel, he suffered a massive heart attack—the 240-volt shock killed him instantly.

Then my best friend took his own life.

We had been working on my garage together when he saw it. A figure walking back and forth in front of the door. He stepped outside to confront it, and for the first time, someone else saw what I had been living with.

He described it in a shaking voice—its face was human, but wrong. Bloated. Burned. Its skin looked as if it had melted, then hardened again. It didn’t walk normally—its limbs moved stiffly, yet with an unnatural, fluid quality at the same time. It made no sound. When their eyes met, the thing simply turned the corner of the building and vanished.

He hung himself the following week with the words it's watching carved into his chest.

Word spread fast—small towns don’t keep secrets. With a population of 1,500, it wasn’t long before everyone knew. And after that, everyone avoided me.

I stopped going into work. Now, I work remotely, locked inside my home. Delivery drivers refuse to knock on my door. They don’t even look up when they drop off my groceries.

I haven’t spoken to another person in months. Maybe years.

And the worst part? The feeling never goes away. That feeling—you know the one. The one where you know someone is watching you from the window. I feel it all the time. Every second of every day.
And then there’s the smell.

Sometimes it’s faint, almost unnoticeable. Other times, it’s overwhelming—a mix of burned hair and rotting meat, seeping into the walls

But I can’t acknowledge it.

I can’t look.

Because if I do… someone else will die.

I’m doomed to live like this forever. No friends. No family. No wife, no children. The ones who haven’t died want nothing to do with me. They won’t speak to me.

Does anyone know how to stop this thing? Am I cursed? Is this my punishment?

Or am I already dead, and I just haven’t realized it yet?

I'm so Tired of being alone someone please talk to me.......
