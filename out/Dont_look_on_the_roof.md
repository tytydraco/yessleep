I need help. I've been being followed by a corpse. Shes just a little girl.

The first time i saw her, she sat at the foot of my bed. Knees pulled to her chest, and an inhuman smile plastered on her face, cutting way too far into her cheeks.

She was decaying.

She had brown tartar crowded up near her gums. Her eyes were opened wide, like they were stuck in fear, they looked so alive, but her irises were such a light blue you could practically see right into them. The whites were yellowish and her skin looked to be in early stages of decomposition. She had an eerily blue, and yellow complexion, the same dark yellow as her eyes.

I can't help but wonder if the dead are always so.. yellow.

She sat and stared at me for a few minutes, head slightly cocked, i stared back. I didnt move, or blink, or breathe. I wished for her to be gone and after what felt like an hour she finally disappeared.
I took a sharp inhale, finally letting myself process what id seen. The thick, rich smell of death lingered in the air, and even though she was gone, my heart still raced. She disappeared into thin air. My room isnt very big, so she couldnt have hidden. She was just gone.

Later that night, after id finally calmed down, i suddenly started feeling as if i was being watched. I looked into the top right corner of my closet, i realized why. There she was, perched on the shelf, watched me intently. She was not smiling now. 
Maybe it was my fear, or maybe her manipulation, but at once the eyes of every poster on my walls began to melt. Just out of their sockets. And even with their eyeballs turned liquid, it felt like their gaze was fixated on me.

I didnt sleep that night, or the night after. When i finally did sleep it was only for about 3 hours. I was seeing her everywhere. 
When driving, especially at night, id often look back and see her sitting in the backseat through my rearview mirror. She liked to remind me that she was still there. My car began to consistently smell like her, and i stopped letting people in it.
In fact, i isolated myself from everyone entirely. I feared that if she met them, theyd start to see her too.
When i would look out the window, id see her lurking in the woods. Standing completely still.

One night, i was driving home down the main road, everyone seemed to already be asleep. It was quiet and calm, and the sky was so clear you could see every star. But while i was distracted, she jumped in front of my car. I swerved to avoid her, and drove off the road. My car and myself were undamaged, i didnt hit anything, and she had disappeared. I began to sob, it had now gotten to the point where she was putting my life at risk. People stopped texting me, because i stopped answering. My world was falling apart.
In the dead silent of the night, i started hearing mumbling whispers from my backseat. She wasnt sitting there, but they grew louder.
Finally, i made out what she was saying.
"look at the roof."
My head shot toward my passenger window, and there she was. On the roof of a house across the street. She stood there, as if to tell me "this is how i died"
Then, without warning, she jumped. I watched as mid air, her body reverted back to that of an alive young girl. I watched her hit the concrete beneath the house. The crunch of her bones and splatter of the impact on her skin rang through my car, even from the distance i kept. I screamed, so loud it hurt my own ears.

Then she looked up. Her eyes wider, her smile bigger, her face mutilated. She looked amused. She stood on her clearly broken legs and her shoulder was dislocated, but she showed no discomfort. She began to walk towards me, she was moving so quick but she looked to be walking normal (or as normal as possible with two broken legs). 

I reached for and fought with my seatbelt, my body gone into panic mode. She was fairly close when i finally got into the back seat on the floor. I didnt know where else to go.

Im sitting here now. Shes got her face pressed up against the glass. I had to have been here for hours by now, but its still as dark as when i got here. I tried calling everyone, i have no cell service. This is my last hope, please let this post. And if you know how i can get out of this, please, help me.
