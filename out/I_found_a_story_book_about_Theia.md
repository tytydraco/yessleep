I found a strange story book in the attic of my house, I think its meant to be a children's book. But the contents are disturbing to say the least. The story is short enough that I thought you might want to judge yourselves.

Darcy awoke. The moon looked strange that night ,dazzling in the infinite bleakness of a starless sky.

She rubbed her eyes, trying to shake off the remnants of sleep, but the sight before her remained unchanged. The moon, to some a familiar and comforting presence. Now seemed to pulse with an otherworldly glow, casting eerie shadows across the landscape.  With curiosity piqued, Darcy slipped on her coat and ventured outside, drawn to the mysterious spectacle above.

Aurelia was the first to show symptoms , all her other siblings followed. Strange behaviours seemed to awaken in them. Singing , serenading , crying , laughing were all things her siblings did when the sky banished the stars and moon stood alone. Was it simply genetics , a heredity mental illness or something more other worldly. It seems Darcy was beginning to follow in their foot steps

As Darcy pondered the mysteries surrounding her family's strange connection to the moon, she couldn't shake the feeling of unease that gnawed at her insides. Was it simply coincidence that all her siblings exhibited similar behaviours under the moon's watchful gaze, or was there something deeper at play? She felt a growing sense of dread mingled with fascination, as if she were being inexorably drawn into a web of secrets and ancient whispers. Despite her fear, a part of her yearned to uncover the truth, to understand the strange legacy that bound her family to the enigmatic power of the moon. With each passing night, Darcy felt herself slipping further into the shadows, her fate entwined with that of her siblings and the mysterious force that beckoned from above.

It happened , Darcy felt the warmth of the moon. She felt her eyes begin to well , a high that could never be beat. A joy no new mother , no drug addict , no human could ever feel. She felt the beauty of a once unfeeling universe shining down on her. The atoms in her body pulsed in something that ecstasy would never come close to describing. 

Darcy's delirious elation was joined by her siblings. She felt a kinship with them , one that seemed to be missing until this night. Like phantoms all with white hair and blue eyes , they danced on the overgrown meadow. 

This was not to last , a goddess of insatiable appetite needed to be fed. Theia was never happy about her stolen destiny. She was meant to be the harbinger of life not earth , she meant to be carrier of melodies for songs. Not have her beauty be reduced to circular ray in the sky. But Theia at least had her children. Born with beautiful white hair just as her surface , if her cult conceived under her celestial rays the children born were never earths.

Darcy and her siblings convulsed as if possessed, their bodies contorting in grotesque shapes under the moon's sinister gaze. With each twist and spasm, their once-human forms warped into something altogether unnatural, their skin pale and clammy, their eyes hollow and empty. The air around them thickened with a sickening stench of decay, as if the very essence of death itself had taken root in their midst.  
  
As Darcy's white hair snaked around her neck like serpents, a river of blood oozed from her pores, staining the ground crimson beneath her trembling feet. Her siblings mirrored her agony, their cries of torment echoing across the desolate landscape like the wails of the damned.  
  
And then, in a macabre crescendo of horror, Darcy and her siblings began to rise from the earth, their limbs twisting and contorting in unnatural angles as they ascended toward the heavens. With each agonizing inch, their bodies fused together into a grotesque amalgamation of flesh and bone, their individuality consumed by the insatiable hunger of Theia.  
  
At last, they reached the heavens, their writhing forms melding seamlessly with the moon's luminous surface. Their screams of agony melded with the eerie silence of the night, a haunting symphony of suffering that echoed through the cosmos for all eternity.  
  
In that moment, Darcy and her siblings became one with Theia, their existence forever intertwined with the dark and malevolent force that lurked within the shadows of the night sky. And as the last echoes of their torment faded into oblivion, the moon cast its baleful light upon the earth below, a silent reminder the consequences of Theias stolen destiny.                                                                                       --               

The disturbing tale would have been easier to dismiss if not for the memory that lingered in my mind....the image of my sister, her snow-white hair shimmering under the moonlight as she danced in the backyard last night.
