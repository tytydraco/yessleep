I moved into the house on Maple Street three months ago. It was cheap—suspiciously cheap. The realtor barely looked at me when I asked why. "Previous owners left quickly," she said. That's all.



The first two months were perfect. Quiet neighborhood, big backyard, hardwood floors that seemed to glow in the evening light. I was happy.



Then I discovered the basement.



I know that sounds stupid. Of course I knew there was a basement—I'd seen the door leading down from the kitchen pantry. But I'd never gone down there. Something about it felt... unwelcoming. Even looking at the door made my stomach tight.



On week nine, a pipe burst in my attic, and water started dripping into the kitchen. The plumber said the water line came from the basement. I had to show him the way down.



That's when I saw it for the first time: the wall.



It was made of old brick, unpainted, running the entire length of the western basement wall. Nothing remarkable about it, except for the carvings. Hundreds of them. Maybe thousands. Scratched into the brick so deep they'd worn grooves in the mortar.



Names. All of them were names.



I asked the plumber if he knew anything about them. He said they were probably there since the house was built in 1962. Kids carving their names, he suggested. A common thing in old houses.



But these weren't carved by kids. The scratches were frantic, desperate. Some names were carved over and over again, as if someone had stood at this wall and carved their own name until their fingers bled.



One name appeared more than any other: SARAH. Carved into the brick at least 200 times. Each carving got deeper, more violent, as if the person was becoming increasingly desperate.



I scrolled through property records online that night. Sarah Hendricks lived here in 1987. She disappeared from this house on August 14th at age 23. She was never found.



I should have moved. Any rational person would have. But I didn't. I told myself it was just a historical curiosity. The plumber fixed the pipe. I went on with my life.



Except I started hearing things.



At first, it was subtle—small sounds from the basement at night. Scratching. Scraping. Like something was being dragged across concrete. I told myself it was mice or rats.



Then the scratching started happening during the day. I'd be upstairs, working at my desk, and I'd hear it. Clear. Deliberate. Rhythmic.



I went down to check. Nothing. The wall was the same. Sarah's name was still there, carved 200 times.



But wait. Was it 200? Or more?



I started counting. It became obsessive. Every few days, I'd go down to the wall and count the carvings. Every time, the number was different. Higher. As if Sarah's name was being added to the wall every night.



By week 12, I'd counted over 300 inscriptions.



I called a historian who specialized in local hauntings. She drove to my house and spent three hours examining the wall. When she left, she told me something I'll never forget:



"This wall is a record. Your basement has been documented. There's a pattern here—every seven years, there's a new occupant, and every seven years, that occupant starts seeing new names carved into the wall. Every owner before you reported the same thing."



"Seeing new names?" I asked.



"The previous owner, Marcus Webb, lived here from 2005 to 2012. He documented 847 carvings in his journal. He found his own name on the wall in November of his last year."



I went down to the basement immediately. I spent four hours examining the wall, running my fingers over every name.



I didn't find my name. Not that first night.



But I found something else: dates. Scratched next to some of the names. Birth dates and death dates. All of them.



Sarah Hendricks: 1964-1987.

Marcus Webb: 1968-2012.

Thomas Chen: 1945-1989.

Diane Morrison: 1952-2001.



Every owner. Every date. Every person who'd lived in this house had their final day marked on this wall.



I ran the dates. Every owner who'd lived in this house had died within 7 years of moving in.



I haven't slept properly in days. I check the wall constantly, looking for my name. I know it's irrational. I know it's not actually happening.



But tonight, I felt it. That familiar scratching sound. Coming from inside the walls now. Not from the basement.



I went to check my name on the wall.



It wasn't there.



But there was something new: my name, carved into the brick right in front of me. Incomplete. Still being carved.



The scratching is happening again. But this time, it's in my bedroom wall. 



This time, it's closer.



This time, I can feel the scratching against my back, like fingernails dragging across my skin from the other side of the drywall.



I think Sarah is still carving.



And I think she's almost finished with my name.



\*\*UPDATE: 3:14 AM\*\*



I found my name. All of it. Fully carved. And next to it, two dates have been scratched:



2025 - 



The year is there. But the final date... the year I'll die... it's still being carved.



The scratching won't stop.



I don't know how much time I have left.



But I know the basement always remembers.
