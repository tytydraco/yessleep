I used to go to school with this kid called Jason. He was the class clown type who loved making himself the center of attention by pissing off teachers. He was always pulling some kind of dumb pranks or cracking jokes in front of the class. We all thought he was a pretty funny guy at the time. Nothing ever seemed to phase him. If throwing a water balloon at a teacher meant getting a week of detention, he'd do it without batting an eye. I thought he was a crazy idiot, but I couldn't deny finding him entertaining.



Jason would eventually stop going to school. The teachers never told us what happened; whether he got expelled or simply transferred schools. He didn't reply to any of my emails either so I was completely in the dark about where he was. Eventually, we forgot about Jason and life resumed as if nothing. A few years later I was a high school junior when my health teacher showed the class a bunch of PSAs. They were the typical videos about stopping bullying and being safe online. The final video we saw that day was an anti-drug one that was filmed in our town. 

The video opened with a shot of a large living room with a vibrant color filter over it. A happy family was having dinner together as upbeat piano music played in the background.

" This is my family." The narrator said. He sounded like a teenager but had a very deep rasp that could've belonged to an older man. " We have our fights every now and then, but they're good people. I'm thinking about telling them I wanna be a pro skateboarder when I grow up."

The scene switched to a skatepark where a bunch of teens practiced their tricks and laughed amongst each other. " And this is where I practice all my best moves. I have this really cool skateboard my uncle gave me. It was designed by this sick graffiti artist from Seattle and it's literally the coolest thing you'd ever see. Wish I could show it to you guys."

The film changed scenes again to a dimly lit alleyway. Broken beer bottles and toppled-over garbage cans littered the streets. You could practically smell the filth radiating from the screen. " This... This is where I met my best friend. We haven't separated ever since."  A man cloaked in shadows handed a small bag to a young teen boy. The white powder in the bag seemed to glow despite all the darkness surrounding it.

" My friend was a real cool guy at first. He always made me feel so alive, like I was untouchable, y'know? Nobody could stop us." Clips of the boy doing crazy stunts like playing in traffic and dancing on rooftops appeared on screen. Everything about his bravado and demeanor felt incredibly familiar.

" This is where I punched my dad."

We transitioned back to the living room from before, but it was in stark contrast to how it previously looked. It now has a dark and grainy filter that gave it a cold feel. Furniture was disheveled, remnants of shattered plates were scattered on the ground, and the once-happy family was now intensely arguing with the boy. He screamed at his father who had a light bruise on his face. The wife was tearfully holding him back from striking back at the son.

" He always had a nasty habit of telling me what to do like he owned me or something. He's such an idiot. Why can't he just be like my friend and let me do what I want?"

Now the boy was back in the skatepark getting into a fistfight with the other skaters. They had him outnumbered 3 to 1. He got sent to the ground with a bloody nose and bruised arms. " This is where I lost most of my friends. They said I'd been acting different and hated the new me. I've never felt better in my life. Was I really all that different?"

" This is where I got arrested for the first time."

" This is where I sold my favorite skateboard for extra cash."

" This is..."

A montage of clips played in rapid succession. All of them showed the boy going through a downward spiral. His skin was emancipated and covered in warts. His tattered clothes hung loosely to his body. It was incredibly uncomfortable seeing the once innocent-looking kid turn himself into a monster. I couldn't image how anyone could do that to themselves.

The final shot was of the boy in the bedroom, lying on the floor with cold, vacant eyes. His parents clutched his lifeless body and sobbed uncontrollably as they tried to bring him back. A couple of sniffles could be heard in the room and I took a moment to wipe my eyes.

" This is where I overdosed. For the third and last time."

What I saw next made me feel like I had an out-of-body experience. It was a photo collage of Jason from when he was a baby to when he became a teenager. The words, " In loving memory of Jason Hopkins" were framed in the middle. There he was as plain as day. I never thought I'd ever see him again, especially not under these circumstances. The question of where he disappeared to was finally answered.

One final part of the film played. It was a man who looked to be in his early 20's sitting in a white room and facing the camera. He had long messy blonde hair and a couple of scars on his face. Saying he looked rough would be an understatement. It became clear he was the narrator once he began speaking. " Hi. My name's Alex and just like Jason, I struggled with drug abuse when I was younger. I thought that drugs were my friends because they were my only comfort during a lot of dark moments in my life. They were also the ones who created a lot of those moments in the first place. I'm lucky that I stopped completely after my first overdose. I would've been six feet under if my brother hadn't saved me at the last second. Jason wasn't so lucky. If you take anything away from this movie, it should be that you don't have to suffer alone. There's resources available to help you break away from your addiction."

I spent the rest of the day in a complete daze. I wondered for years what happened to Jason, but this was the last thing I wanted. I thought back to how he always chased after the next thrill and how he thrived off of danger. The idea of him trying drugs wasn't that shocking in retrospect. I just wished someone could've helped him turn his life around before it was too late.
