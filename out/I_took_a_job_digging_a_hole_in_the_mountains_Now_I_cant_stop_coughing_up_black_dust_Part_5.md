Plato was different in the morning.

Not sick different. Not feverish or broken or any of the deterioration I'd watched consume him over the past days. The opposite. The tremors were gone. The cough had stopped. His skin had lost its flushed, sweaty sheen and taken on a cold, dry pallor like paper. When he moved, it was with precise, economical efficiency—no wasted motion, no human hesitation.

He dressed without speaking. Packed his notebook. Walked past me like I was furniture.

"Plato?" I tried. "You good?"

He paused at the tent flap. Looked at me with those dilated pupils. "The signal is very clear this morning."

Then he was gone.

I found him ten minutes later, standing in front of Koke, speaking in that flat, radio-signal voice.

"The southeast wall. Seven feet down. There's a concentration."

Koke didn't question him. Didn't ask how he knew. Just nodded once and started directing the crew to that section. I grabbed Plato's arm. His skin was cold.

"Man, what are you doing? How do you know what's down there?"

He looked through me. Not at me. Through me. Like I was glass. Like I was already a memory.

"I understand the manifest now," he said to the air, to the mountain, to something I couldn't perceive. "It's not noise. It's inventory. A shipping list. I can hear what needs to be retrieved."

"You're not making sense."

"I'm making perfect sense. You're just operating on outdated protocols."

He pulled his arm free and walked to the hole's edge, standing there like a piece of the mountain itself.

They dug where he pointed.

Two hours later, they'd uncovered three perfect core samples. Those dark, glowing stones Joseph craved and a cluster of metallic artifacts. More than we'd found in three days of random excavation. The crew was electrified. Even Koke's professional mask cracked slightly, the corners of his mouth twitching in what might have been satisfaction.

Joseph arrived within the hour. He examined the haul with hands that actually trembled, made three separate satellite calls, and started handing out bonuses with an almost manic efficiency. The numbers kept climbing. Two hundred. Five hundred. A thousand for the guy who'd been topside when Plato gave the location.

Plato received nothing. He didn't seem to notice. He just stood at the hole's edge, staring down, occasionally making notes in his book with that inhuman speed.

Jim watched all of this from the shadows of his tent. When Plato's back was turned, he caught my eye and spat into the dirt. The message was clear: *Boy just signed his own pink slip. They own him now.*

Evening came. The crew was celebrating, counting money, making plans. I expected Plato to come back to our tent. We'd share a look. He'd snap out of it. We'd leave.

He didn't come back.

I found him dragging his bedroll to the lip of the hole, arranging it on the bare rock maybe three feet from the edge.

"What are you doing?"

"The signal is clearer here." He didn't look up. "Interference is minimal. I can process the data more efficiently."

"Process the data? Plato, you're not a fucking radio."

He finally looked at me. His face was blank. Serene. The face of someone who'd found religion or lost their mind, and I couldn't tell which was worse.

"I'm more useful here. You should go back to the tent."

Felt like getting dumped and fired and evicted all at once. Dude just... ghosted. Moved his shit to the hole like it had better WiFi. He'd moved out. Divorced me. Chosen the hole over everything we'd been through together. I wanted to scream at him. Shake him. Drag him away.

Instead I just stood there, feeling that profound, gut-wrenching abandonment settle into my bones.

Jim appeared at my elbow. "Come on, kid. Nothing you can do for him now."

"He's sick. He's not thinking straight."

"He's thinking straighter than he ever has. That's the problem. The work gets in, and it don't get out. He's not yours anymore. He's theirs."

I went back to the tent alone. Lay in my sleeping bag staring at Plato's empty one. The generator hummed. The hole breathed. Somewhere outside, Plato was probably taking notes on the rhythm of that breathing, cataloging it, processing it into useful data.

The tent flap opened.

Carli slipped inside, moving with that practiced efficiency. But her energy was different tonight. Not clinical. Buzzing with something electric and hungry.

"He's magnificent," she said, voice low and intense. She didn't sit. Just stood there, looking at me with eyes that gleamed in the dim light. "Your friend. He's transcendent. He's not just a worker anymore. He's essential."

"He's sick."

"He's *evolved*." She moved closer. I could smell her—sweat and dust and something underneath like ozone. "Do you understand what he represents? It's beautiful."

The way she said "beautiful" made my skin crawl. There was arousal in it. Not sexual exactly. Something deeper. She was turned on by his transformation. By the power he now represented. By his complete subsumption into the system.

"You're fucking insane. All of you."

"Am I?" She knelt beside my sleeping bag. "Or am I the only one being honest about what's happening here? He found his purpose. His significance. He matters now in a way he never did hauling garbage or sleeping in motels or whatever dead-end shit he was doing before."

Her hand touched my arm. I should have pulled away. Should have told her to get out. But I was so tired. So isolated. So fucking alone.

"You could be essential too," she said softly. "You're connected to him. That's a form of power. They notice that. Joseph notices. You have proximity to something valuable."

"I don't want to be valuable to Joseph."

"Everyone wants to matter, Thomas. Everyone wants to be seen. To be necessary. You think you're different? You think your poverty is more noble than everyone else's?"

She was closer now. I could feel her breath on my face. This wasn't seduction. Not really. It was recruitment. An offer of significance through proximity. A reflected glow.

"He's not sick," she whispered. "He's awake. And you're still dreaming about escape when the only real choice is what role you play in what's coming."

I wanted to push her away. To defend Plato. To defend myself. But she was right about one thing—I was desperate. Desperate for human contact. Desperate to matter. Desperate for any anchor in this nightmare.

What happened next wasn't passion. It was desperation. Two animals seeking warmth in the slaughterhouse, pretending for a few minutes that we weren't both being processed. She knew exactly what she was doing. I knew exactly what I was giving up.

I did it anyway.

Shame hits different in the dark. In the moment, you can almost convince yourself you're making a choice. After, alone with yourself, you know exactly what you are.

Carli left before dawn. No goodbye. No pretense. She'd gotten what she came for, another data point, another compromised asset, another person isolated and ashamed.

Jim was standing outside when I unzipped the tent flap. Smoking. Not looking at me directly but seeing everything anyway.

"So that's your move, huh?" His voice was gravel scraped over concrete. No anger in it. Just profound, devastating disappointment. "The machine grinds your friend into paste, and you fuck its secretary. You think that makes you safe? That makes you part of the furniture, not the product."

I couldn't meet his eyes. "You don't understand."

"I understand plenty. I understand you just traded whatever claim you had to moral high ground for ten minutes of feeling less alone. I understand you're scared and broke and desperate. We all are. Difference is, some of us remember which side we're on."

He took a long drag, blew smoke into the pre-dawn gray. "Sal's gone. Wasn't in his tent all night."

The shame curdled instantly into ice-cold terror. "What?"

"Gone. Noticed around two AM when I got up to piss. Tent's empty. Boots are gone." He flicked the cigarette into the dirt. "You were busy, so I figured I'd let you know when you came up for air."

Koke's whistle cut through the camp. Six AM. Assembly time.

The crew gathered, bleary and hungover. Koke stood with his clipboard, counting heads, expression flat.

"One absent. Sal. Check the perimeter. Five-minute search radius. Then begin shift."

Not concerned. Not worried. Procedural. Like checking inventory and noting a missing unit.

We spread out, calling Sal's name, moving through the woods in expanding circles. Found nothing. No tracks. No signs. Like he'd simply evaporated.

When we returned to the clearing, Plato was standing at the hole's edge. He'd been there the whole time, hadn't joined the search. He pointed down with one steady finger.

"He's here. He answered the call."

We hauled up the cable. It was weighted. Heavy. Wrong.

Twenty feet down, in a narrow shaft that hadn't existed yesterday, we found Sal.

He was dead. Not fallen. Not placed. He'd dug himself in there. His hands were shredded to bone, fingernails torn off, surrounded by a perfect circle of those dark stones like he'd been arranging them, cataloging them, processing them until his heart gave out. His face was serene. Almost peaceful. The face of someone who'd found what they were looking for.

The crew went silent. Not shocked. Broken. That silence when everyone's too fucked up to even swear. When horror becomes just another Tuesday.

Koke knelt at the edge, examining the new shaft, the stone arrangement. He checked his watch. Made a note in his log.

"Efficient. Autonomous excavation. Note the precision of the circle. Approximately seven hours of work at accelerated pace. Cause of death: cardiac arrest induced by extreme exertion. Log entry complete."

He was analyzing the work product. Sal's death was interesting primarily for the data it provided about unmonitored excavation efficiency.

Something inside me snapped.

"You knew!" I screamed at Plato. "You fucking knew! You heard him go down! You let him!"

Plato turned those empty eyes on me. When he spoke, his voice had all the warmth of a diagnostic readout.

"The system identified inefficiencies and executed corrective measures. His extraction protocols were non-optimal. Had to disrupt the legacy system.." A pause. "You cling to sentiment. You cling to her." A flick of his gaze toward Carli, who watched from beside Joseph with that neutral mask. "Your operational efficiency is compromised, man. You're generating interference in the data stream. Legacy protocols."

Noise. I knocked him down, and stormed off,

That's what I was to him now. Not his friend. Not his partner. Just interference in the data stream. A bug to be debugged. A problem to be solved.

The betrayal was complete. All that shit we went through together - the holding cell laughs, sleeping in the van, sharing the last cigarette - fucking deleted. Replaced with pure system logic. Plato had internalized the Company's language so completely he couldn't even recognize me as human anymore.

I staggered away from the hole, from his empty stare, from Carli's cool assessment. Bile rose in my throat. My hands shook. I'd betrayed him and he didn't even care enough to be angry because I'd already been categorized as irrelevant data.

Jim intercepted me behind the tool shed, pulling me into the shadows with surprising strength. His eyes were fierce, more alive than I'd seen them.

"You see it now? Clear? You're with me, or you're with them. Or you're in the hole. Those are your options."

I couldn't speak. Just nodded.

He leaned in close, voice dropping to barely audible. "They want their core sample so bad? Let's give it to them. Tomorrow, on the final pull, when they've got whatever they're actually looking for, we don't secure the winch. We let the whole goddamn thing drop. Cable, bucket, their precious rock. Everything. We jam the works. We bury their prize and seal the fucking hole."

His grip on my shoulder tightened. "It'll be a fight. Koke will come for us. Maybe your friend too. Maybe Carli. But we end this. One way or another, we end it. You in?"

I looked back toward camp. Plato stood sentinel at the hole's edge, notebook in hand, taking measurements. Joseph and Carli conferring in low tones. Koke logging Sal's death as acceptable parameters. The generator humming its endless song. The mountain breathing. The system processing. The assembly line running smoothly.

I was out of choices. Out of friends. Out of dignity. All I had left was rage and shame and the desperate need to break something before it finished breaking me.

I met Jim's eyes.

"I'm in."
