April 30

I’ve come across a question I’m afraid to ask. 

The answer might cast a light on what I’d rather not see. Things I always chalked up to bad luck or just the way things are. I often noticed that my memories seemed out of place, or slightly off. It always seemed like it all could be traced back to the coma, like drops of blood combining at the edge of a drain. 

The moment that fractured everything. When recalling any memory became as difficult as seeing through a shattered window. I write this here because I feel like I can’t trust myself to remember anymore. I write this here because I could hardly ever read my own handwriting, a problem that makes the question ever harder to solve. 

The question, like a scream in the dark down the hall on a peaceful night, is unwelcome. I wonder if I should just close my eyes and wait, and hope I’d never registered it at all.
 
The question.

Why can’t I remember writing The Abandoned House?


May 1

I’ve realized I need to share everything here. I’m not sure if I’ll remember everything the way it really happened if I don’t. Or if it won’t make sense when I do. 

I almost thought it was an April Fool’s joke at first. At the premiere of a film based on a story I’d made, The Burn Pit, one fan stopped me not to ask for an autograph or for my opinion on how they’d butchered the ending. She looked at me with a pair of bright green eyes that seemed to shine as she asked, “I’ve always wondered, what happened at the end of The Abandoned House, really?” 

I couldn’t help but pause. Occasionally, someone gets a title wrong, slightly altering a word or two in something I’ve written. But this title brought nothing. I felt like I was peering out into a wall of fog as I searched for any hint of it. I told her it wasn’t one of mine, and her expression drifted into something more than disappointment. Something close to resentment. 

She wandered off, yet the question lingered with me. The title, The Abandoned House. It felt like something I’d write. It was like finding an old picture you’re in and being shocked you can’t place what, when, or where it was. I felt that place in the back of my mind begin to work, synapses firing and connections forming. The feeling when a new story is forming, already beginning to fight its way out. 

A quick search on my phone as I left the theater while walking to my car left me frozen in place. There on the internet movie database was the title The Abandoned House, released September 23, 1997.

And beside screenplay, my name. Matthew Rook. 

May 2
I woke up last night dripping sweat. I haven’t had a chance to look up anything else. Or maybe I haven’t had the courage. But this story keeps clawing at the corners of my mind. Normally, I’d never hold back that wonderful burst of inspiration. But this is different. I had to write something, and this is what I found on the screen after an hour of furious typing. 

The Abandoned House

Loneliness is not found when no one is around. It comes when you realize there's not enough left of you to share if there was. 

Pale amber light pours in from one of the holes where the roof had admitted defeat, a beam glistening across a cracked bottle. The structure bends and creaks in the wind now, begging for the day it will be overwhelmed.

A black rain begins to trickle down from above, heavens weeping now at what they saw. The mold metastasizing throughout the walls gleefully drank and continued to creep into every corner.

Once, laughter had filled the walls that now only harbored the blackest moss. Arguments had stained the air, drifting into cold silence that would seem searing compared to the state it was in now. The growth had infected the smallest room, worst of all, infiltrating the yellow paint and gradually overtaking the crib in the corner. It had never been touched after the day the laughter died.

I am what remains.

I am a shadow in the dark. The last gasp of a scream no one ever heard. A hand that cannot hold. A memory of a dream dissolving into dawn.

I am what remains in the husk of a home no one could live in.

Far too late, I realize there's not enough left to save. 

This isn’t how I normally write. But this is what has bubbled to the surface. Now that I’ve shaken it loose, I’m going back to sleep. Maybe tomorrow I’ll look this movie up. 


May 3
I tried not to look it up. I thought about just waiting for the memory to fade, like a trail that hadn’t been walked on enough. But the story kept appearing in that space just behind my mind. Growing and changing. I had to know if I was dreaming up something new or just remembering an old story. 

It’s hard to recall anything from that time. I’m clean now, but before the accident I feel like days at a time vanished into the bright light a line of coke would spark in my mind. Entire stories often appeared on my old Macintosh, and some I look back on and cringe. It wouldn’t have been the first screenplay. I helped make that awful werecat movie a reality after all. It shouldn’t matter. It doesn’t matter. 

But I caved. After a quick search, I came back across the IMDb page reminding me it came out September 23, 1997. Just months before everything changed. But the results abruptly ended there. No streaming platforms listed, not one link to watch online. Nothing showed on Netflix, Amazon, or any cult movie sites. Not even a bootleg YouTube with potato quality. No age old used DVD or VHS copies floating around. 

All I could find were a few mentions on fan forums and an article from an archived GeoCities page calling it an “uneven, haunting gem with an ending that is what you make of it.” A few mentions of how impossible it was to find. I eventually switched back to IMDb and scanned the rest of the credits.

The director had died in 2003. Not one actor from the three main cast had filmed another movie. The database didn’t even have headshots for them. It felt like the entire project had come and gone, like an eclipse. 

The only name I could recognize was Elliot Grayson, the producer. I’d worked with him a few times in the mid 2000s, before any of my stories really started making money in Hollywood. He’d been professional but distant. He preferred to say as little as possible, and I remembered liking that. 

I’m leaning back in my chair, trying to recall something I don’t think ever happened while resisting my imagination’s call to arms. My heart was pounding, but I couldn’t say why. It feels like I’m trying to recall someone else’s half-forgotten dream the next day. 

Why can’t I remember writing it? And why do I feel so afraid of finding out? 

May 3
 
I can’t sleep anymore. I wake up and the story screams behind my eyes, begging me to work on it. Some part of me almost hopes I can finish this draft before I do find the movie, so I can see which turned out better. I found myself typing this morning, cold coffee sitting beside me only growing colder.
 
This is what I’ve made so far.
 
The Abandoned House
 
The bottle slipped from his hand across the filth covered floor, rattle echoing through empty walls. For a moment, his hazel eyes fell on it and searched for shards of shattered glass. Then he laughed—a hollow, rasping sound that fell off the peeling paint throughout the home.
 
Of course it didn’t. He thought to himself, though he could not place what that made it so funny.
 
He hauled himself to his feet, swaying as the room began to tilt. A layer of grime cushioned every footfall, the accumulated decay a soft and strangely comforting. The flickering lights offered little clarity, sputtering in and out of existence like a memory just out of reach.
 
He fought through unsteady steps as long as he could until one foot landed wrong. The fall knocked the air from his lungs, but the impact did not feel the way it should have. Instead, the weight of the house pressed in on him as he laid on his side—the damp rot, the stale air, the relentless quiet. He laughed again, the sound sharper this time. He searched the floor for his phone, though he knew there was no one he could call.
 
Nobody would answer. Not for him.
 
A gust of wind cut through the room, unexpected frigid air kicking up dust and debris as it squeezed in through every broken window and crack in the walls. He squinted into the dimness, trying to pinpoint its source. He told himself he would check tomorrow, though it was another lie.
 
The fridge groaned, a low, mournful sound that echoed through the kitchen. He was not sure why, but the interruption left him started. He shuffled toward it, fumbling inside and pulling out the one thing it still offered. Another drink.
 
He unscrewed the cap and tossed the plastic over his shoulder, unbothered when it came to rest silently. The whiskey burned his throat in a way that felt familiar, almost comforting. He sank into a corner of the room, shadows embracing him like an old friend.
 
Kyle closed his eyes and tried to remember how he had ended up like this. For what felt like hours, he sifted through dead memories, though none of them seemed to fit. The house creaked and groaned around him, alive in ways he could not be. When he opened his eyes again, the illusion of warmth was gone.
 
Leaves drifted through the shattered windows, dancing through the otherwise still air. The fridge door hung open, its insides empty and silent. The bottle in his hand was dry now, though he did not remember drinking the last.
 
All that remained now was the house.
 
Sitting back, I stare at the name the longest. I usually labor over them, struggling to find the one that sounds right. That has some personal meaning that isn’t too obvious. But like the rest of this story, it simply appeared.
 
It’s like I can’t stop it.

May 5
I spent all yesterday sleeping, lost in a dark and twisting adventure behind my eyes that I can’t recall. Like so many things. I think the sleep did me well. I felt so worn down and ragged the last few days. All I had done was write a bit, and yet it felt like I was on the verge of collapse.

 This morning, I shot an email to the producer on the film, Elliot Grayson. Our last communique was over a decade ago working on an adaptation of one of my more action focused stories. The movie itself turned out well. But from what I recall, it almost felt like he spent the production avoiding me. Looking over our emails, it seems like he always waited as long as possible to answer. Most producers I work alongside now are eager for any insight or detail, often if only to paint the production an air of legitimacy.

That’s why I was all the more surprised when he fired back an answer not two hours later. He said The Abandoned House was a small, indie production I hold sold the rights to for next to nothing. He said he’d asked why and had told him I didn’t like the idea enough to make it a novel. When he asked, I had told him it had turned out fine, but I simply didn’t like making it.

I wonder if I had that same feeling as I do now, of the story threatening to tear its way out if I did not commit it to a page in time. To find some use for it. He finished by saying unfortunately he didn’t have a copy, and the movie had sold so poorly it had never even seen a reprint after a first VHS run, no doubt after a few of my other works took off. He wasn’t even sure who held the rights now.

I sent one question back, asking if he could remember the story of the movie. It shouldn’t have surprised me when no answer came. For some time, I tried to connect the things he had said to what memories I could exhume.

It’s so hard to remember anything from that time. I had in the past chalked it up to the cocktail of drinks and drugs I’d blamed all my creativity on. I made a lot of poor choices back then. The kind that end with being you found half dead on the side of the highway. Just recalling that road sends a slight shiver down my spine.

 The only one other person I can think to ask about all this never answered the last few times I tried. I really doubt she wants a trip down memory lane because I can’t remember writing some movie.

Maybe a thrift story or the library might have a copy. I think I’ll try tomorrow. I’m not sure why, but I feel tired again.
 
 6 May
 
Amber.

Her name on my phone made the device feel heavier. I couldn’t say what scared me more; if she were to ignore my question or the sound of her voice if she answered. Time seemed to vanish, the clock on my phone leaving me behind. Before I could force a decision, another name replaced her as the dial trilled.
Barry, my agent.

I let out a long breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding and answered the call.

“Matty,” He began without any preamble, accented voice tinged with humor, “I thought I’d have heard from you by now, and gotten all your gripes about what they did to Burn Pit.” I felt my brow furrowing and was surprised to find the premier had been the last thing on my mind lately.

“You thought I’dwith no be mad they cut the teeth scenes.”

“The big wigs said it was too much for audiences to take. They wouldn’t even let the director film the first one for an unrated version, though the second is on film somewhere.” He behind his typical bravado, I almost felt a hint of worry creeping into his voice. I normally would have reached out to him by now if this story hadn’t crashed through my every waking hour since. Regardless, I couldn’t help but ask him, “Hey, we’ve been working together for what, almost twenty years, right?” 

His response was uncharacteristically unsure. There was a brief pause. “I mean, yeah. In that ballpark. Is uh, everything okay Matt?”

I already knew he had no answers, but asked anyway, “Did you ever see The Abandoned House? I wrote its screenplay before we started working together.”

To my surprise, Barry answered, “Yeah, I caught part of it on TV back in the 90s. Honestly? I didn’t really get it. I thought you just wanted a quick buck.”
“What was it about?”

Another pause, longer this time. The silence buzzing in my ear growing into a roar until he recanted, “Uhh… I didn’t finish it, sorry. I had a lady friend coming over. But it had some guy stuck in a house. A ghost maybe? Mysterious as hell, and then I got a bit distracted. If you want, I can try to find you a copy.”

“Yeah, that’d be great. Thanks Barry.”

He didn’t press for any details. Instead, he shifted into mentioning our editor was excited to see the next draft of the black hole story. I mumbled a lie that I’d send it soon and hung up to find her name still on the screen waiting for me.

Amber.

Memories seeped through my mind despite every attempt to keep them at bay. For years, she was the only person willing to put up with me. She worked two jobs back when my early books barely made a dent, and yet we had been happy barely scratching by. When things changed and money became no issue, she just kept working anyway. Said she couldn’t sit around and watch me write all day.

She was patient at first. Even when I disappeared for hours at a time on long dark roads with my mind abuzz from whatever I could get my hands on. But in time, the stories I was writing were overtaking me, the same ones she had fought so hard to let me make. The more I wrote, the less of me there was left to offer.
After the accident, her kindness faded. She often implied I wasn’t the man she’d married. It’s not fair to blame her. I never acted in violence, but I took every ounce of pain and withdrawal out on her. Even my memory, or lack of it.

For a while, she was patient. Understanding that being in a coma for a month may leave someone with memory loss, but it was worse than that. I wasn’t just healing, but struggling to escape the whirlpool of withdrawal. She came to believe I simply lied to her any time I couldn’t remember something.
It ended on a Friday night. She said I’d forgotten our anniversary, though I rudely snapped back it wasn’t until the next week. I should have looked at the calendar. I should have apologized. Instead, I let my anger spill out on her regardless of if she deserved it.

She stared at me for a long time. Then, in a quiet voice, she asked, “Matt, look at me. Can you even tell me where we met?”
I rolled my eyes and quickly answered. “We met at the carnival. James introduced me to you. I asked if you wanted to ride the spinning UFO, and you grabbed my hand when it started.”

Her blue eyes seemed to burn through me as she stared, offering no response. She glanced down at her hands before slowly prying her ring off and setting it on the table. The front door slamming was her last answer.

I’m afraid to ask her. Afraid I don’t deserve an answer. Would her answer change anything? Or would she leave me in silence, like on that Friday night?

May 7
I dreamt of the road again last night.

Wesley Earl Road, an unassuming turn off Transmountain Highway that ends up twisting and turning through the jagged burst of rock that emerged from the desert millions of years ago. I often dream I’m driving down a long, winding road on the edge of a cliff but don’t even recall the name the next day. But last night, it was as clear as the moon hanging in the night sky.

I used to disappear into the jaws of that road for hours at a time, mind reeling from whatever I shouldn’t have taken before getting behind the wheel. Yet no matter how far I drove, my watch and speedometer would always yield little, and eventually I’d lose my buzz and turn around before coming home. I never reached the end, even though one night I’d almost met mine on it.

I always went down the road because no one else seemed to. The road was too narrow in places for two cars despite the yellow divider line in the middle’s claim. What almost felt lie whispered warnings came at the last second, and I often yanked the wheel one way or the other to make a sharp turn when lost in thought. I had some of my best ideas as my car screamed over the road’s cracked pavement, though I couldn’t honestly recall one I’d used in any story.
The road always took more than it gave.

Between serving as an initial pressure point between Amber and I and the promise of danger it eventually kept, I lost a lot out on that road.

A familiar pain in my left leg seeps in as I’m writing this. The familiar sensation, like an old friend, tends to fade with time but never truly abandons me. That place where the bone in my leg bent but somehow didn’t fully break. The abnormal injury that the doctors said was normally only seen in young children had haunted my efforts to learn to walk again after I woke up. I sometimes wonder if a piece of me is still out there, and if I drove back, what I’d find.

I never had gone back after the accident. Never even paid it much thought before The Abandoned House began bleeding back into my life. It occurs to me now that I can’t remember the night of the accident. If I hit something, or swerved off the road to avoid something that shouldn’t have been there.

I pause at that thought. I’m not entirely sure what that could have meant, and I am surprised such an idea appeared. The only thing that shouldn’t have been there that night was me. That I can be sure of.

For now, I’m going back to writing. 

May 7
My head is killing me, but the next page is born. While stopping never felt like a possibility, every paragraph felt like pulling a tooth out with a pair of pliers. I briefly wonder if there was a way to tastefully change the scene in The Burn Pit to allow them to use it. Doesn’t matter now. Writing this feels like an urgent step and yet hours flicker by for only a page to present itself when I’m briefly satisfied.

Can’t think of anything more to say. I can’t remember the last time I wanted a drink more. See below:
 
—-
Sunlight trickled in through the broken, boarded-up windows to cast slivers of golden light that gradually dances across the floor as hours passed until one met his closed eye. He blinked slowly, hazel eyes flecked with flecks of gray, struggling to adjust to the harsh reality that day brought. Now there were no shadows left to blot out the rotting corpse of a beautiful home around him.
 
For a moment he wondered when it had begun to decay, but no answer came.
 
The front door was hanging on by splinters, the lock uselessly set on a barrier that could hardly hold the wind at bay. The ceiling above him on the first floor had succumbed to the weight of water over time, sagging in places that hadn’t already given way to drop chunks of rotted drywall to the floor. Scattered needles and bottles lay about, and he could almost convince himself they weren’t his.
 
Almost.
 
He realized the sight of the home decomposing around him should spark a feeling of abject horror, but despair was his only constant companion. It seemed impossible for anyone to actually live in what was left here and yet, he couldn’t actually recall the last time he’d stepped outside. It felt like he’d always been here, trapped in a forgotten story that no one told.
 
He also felt like he realized all of this before.
 
A gust of wind tore through, whipping the worn pages of an old leather-bound journal resting on an uneven table in the kitchen. He ran his hand over the yellowed pages, feeling for the forgotten words within. He flipped through the diary and was surprised to find all but one page remained empty. On one page he found words scrawled in black in that read, “You have to let her go.” Kyle felt his brow crease at the command, doubting he had written such a message.
 
The answers seemed as lost as his home now.
 
He slipped the journal into his back pocket and turned to face the vestige of a front door. He wondered if he should grab a coat, but let the idea fade away as any time spent within could lead to him losing more time. With a deep breath, he stepped through the ruined doorway out into an alien world kissed by the sun.
 
 May 15
It’s been a few days since I updated anything. I’ve been trying to find things. Going through old photo albums, digging up anything I can in old laptops from that time. It doesn’t help that after the divorce, I put very little thought into preserving the past. I just kept working, convincing myself that if I wrote enough good stories and had enough money that everything would eventually click into place.

But without Amber, it all just felt hollow. I was like a ghost walking through my life, unaware that the accident on that highway years ago had killed the human part of me. It’s not something I linger on, but it often feels like my life just happens around me. It’s only times like now where I confront my inactivity.
A character caught between pages, realizing something isn’t right.

But enough pretentious musing. I had an odd memory the other night. I found a picture of my old Mazda, a beautiful silver convertible I had loved to drive with the top down deep into the night. Something about it stirred a recollection in me, a memory bubbling to the surface of my mind.

The night of the accident, I’d found a bridge on Wesley Earl Road. I wasn’t sure of anything beyond that, but I felt like my adventure had ended that night on the bridge.
I’m not sure how many more answers I can find here. In the meantime, I managed to finish another page.
 
-       - -
He wasn’t sure how long he’d been gone, but the town had not waited for a triumphant return. None of the faces felt familiar, and despite recognizing street names, he was surprised repeatedly by how the businesses all seemed to bear unfamiliar names. It was clear he was past the point of asking anyone for help.

The midway sun washed the world in stark, pale white light and he couldn’t help but wonder if it only seemed so to him. Another question constantly burrowing in the corner of his mind was where he was intending to go. His legs seemed to carry him across the bleached pavement with a sense of purpose he didn’t understand in the slightest.

It wasn’t until he came to rest before a large, imposing structure that he recognized the destination. The sight of “Arthur Clarke Hospital” emblazoned across the side of the building made his stomach churn. The nausea fled as he realized there was nothing inside to heave, anyway.

The cry of a crow caught his attention, followed by the rustle of wings slicing through the air. He turned to find a thin figure draped in black now standing behind him. The figure was pale, with paper white features and long platinum hair whose strands seemed immune to the wind. The lanky man flashed a disarming smile and answered before being asked, “Yes, I can see you.”

Kyle’s voice caught in his throat, silence stretching between the pair until the man added, “I didn’t expect you to remember me. You never do.”

A car drifted between us, brakes sighing as it came to a stop. The occupants remained staring ahead, blissfully unaware of the exchange. With a touch of hesitation, he asked, “Are you… Death?”

A rough laugh escaped the man. “I’m Carl, actually. The big man rarely takes shifts anymore. No, I was once like you. Though, maybe not as big a pain in the ass.”
Kyle turned away to face the hospital, still at a loss for why he’d felt so driven to come here. He felt a growing sense of dread that culminated in the question, “Are you here to take me?”

Carl’s smile sharpened, his porcelain features set into a grim mask as he replied, “You have to be ready. We only force the violent ones. You’re not there, yet. For now, you’re still harmless.” After a pregnant pause, Carl seemed satisfied he’d made his point and finished, “Keep checking your journal. I’ll be around.”

 Kyle turned back at the sound of another wing beat to find the road behind him empty again. His fingers grasped the leather binding of the journal and he brought it into the light, flipping to a random page. To his surprise, a new message awaited him, scrawled with fresh ink.

She never even had a chance.

 May 20
I drove down Wesley Earl Road last night. It was completely different in the absence of any drugs or alcohol, yet the road played its same old tricks. I drove for what felt like hours, only to find my clock had inched ahead by forty-two minutes. My speedometer told a similar lie. In the end, I turned around and came home without incident. 

It felt like the longer I was on that road, the more pronounced every bump and turn grew, as though warning me away from something terrible. My nerves eventually won out, and I turned around long before confirming if there was any bridge at the end, or if that had all been a mistaken memory. In the meantime, I finished another page of The Abandoned House. It feels like the story is ending, and with it I’m not sure what I’ll find. Even though I’m writing it. 

Aren’t I? Who else could be writing it?
-	- - 
Kyle’s legs carried him down an unknown path, each automatic step detached from his wandering thoughts. His mind flickered back to the first moment he ever truly felt alive. When a smile alone nearly knocked him off his feet. Annabelle’s smile. It was such a radiant, wide grin that seemed so disconnected from the rest of the world and its troubles. He saw it again the day he worked up the nerve to ask out the prettiest cashier in all of Redbrook. 

Their fate was sealed. 

Dates, anniversaries, family dinners, fights, moonlit walks and a modest wedding all flickered through his mind in seconds like a dream dissolving into dawn. The sweetest memories now stung the most. At the end of the chain he recalled the day the pair were lost blanched white walls with Annabelle crying and a professional walking them through what came next. Telling them it happens more often than people think. The moment gave birth to an anger and sadness that stripped the color from his heart. 

Nights spent losing himself in drinking came to mind. The endless silence filling the void between the two in their bed every night. The moment he’d stumbled in later than he’d meant to and found her beside a puddle of vomit filled with pills. 

The sky had been crying that night with him. He stopped walking to find himself staring at a grave. Though Annabelle’s name was alone on the stone, he felt two lives lost in the soil. He glanced down at the journal again to find fresh words within.

You weren’t there. Even when you were. 

He felt himself moving, but simply let himself ride passenger again on the way home. Before the door to the abandoned house, he stopped and looked over to find Carl waiting with a smaller smile than before. He asked the apparition, “How many times have I made it this far?” 

The reaper now stood next to him, silver eyes staring into the remnants of a forlorn home. Another gust of wind sprinted past and rattled the boards lining the windows. Eyes set afar he replied, “Five times. It’s been almost a decade. You’re lucky I’m so patient.” 

This time, his legs seemed to be patiently awaiting orders. Kyle nodded, contemplating what awaited him within. He asked the angel, “Why would you do this for me?” 
Wide smile returning to his sharp features Carl answered, “There’s only two kinds of spirits. The ones who move on and the ones that get destroyed. You’ve come close a few times. Lashed out at kids fucking around in there, but I think you can do it. It wasn’t easy for me, either.” 

He nodded at the reaper and smiled back as best he could. He wanted to ask what he needed to do but already knew. Kyle took a step into the doorway and stopped at the sound of Carl warning, “No pressure but, soon I may not have a choice.” 

Kyle turned to his only friend in the afterlife and nodded. Carl added, “I’ll be right outside, no matter what happens.” 

May 25

It all came back to me in a moment. Almost like the memory had always been there and I just didn’t want to retrieve it. When you wake up from a dream, the things your mind made up while your eyes were closed begin to fade. It’s different with a coma. When you wake, it feels like your memories and dreams entwine, like a tree grows around a signpost planted through its roots. Everything becomes a question. 

That night I found the bridge, it wasn’t night at all.

Dawn had begun to creep over the mountain, sunlight spilling through clouds suffocating the sky in a pale, almost white haze. I had come across a bridge and without a second thought begun barreling across it. In the fog, a rarity in such an acrid climate, I was surprised to find the bridge beginning to turn to the left. Most were long, straight affairs. 

It was only when I began spinning my wheel I saw it. I can’t say for certain if I was on the wrong side of the road, or he was. A pair of headlights burst out from the silent wall of white between us, directly coming my way on the narrow bridge. I swore aloud and yanked my wheel in the opposite direction, glaring stare leaving the road to try and take in the car I was careening to miss. 

It was a silver Mazda with the top down. In the driver’s seat a similar glare came to meet my own. Except it wasn’t similar. It was mine. For one instant, I saw myself in the car I’d just swerved to miss on the bridge that concluded Wesley Earl Road. 

And then months of darkness followed, swallowing up the unwanted memory. There isn’t anything else left to say. The only thoughtsI have are in a word, crazy. 

May 30

This is the end.
 
I’ve decided it’s time I drive to the end of the road. Find the bridge and see what’s waiting for me there. Maybe I am. I think now about the bent bone in my leg. To fix it, they had to snap it in three places and then reset it back to a straight line. 

Barry came through with a copy of the movie. Old and weathered, it nonetheless is the version of The Abandoned House he made back in the 90s. It’s a lot like mine, but the ending is different. I think it’s the last thing I needed to make up my mind. 

I’m going to put my last page here. I hope whoever finds it can understand. It might just be me, tired after a long fruitless drive. Or it might be someone else. Either way, I hope it finds you well. 

I hope it all makes sense. 

-	- - 

Kyle stepped through the door; his jacket tossed behind him. His eyes quickly snapped to an orange prescription bottle on the counter, and he wasted no time swallowing two Percocet with the help of some whiskey. He settled into his chair and waited for the mix of fire and medicine to find balance within him. 

A phone rang somewhere in the distance, its shrill tone piercing the silence. He ignored it, already certain any concern shown on the other end was just to mask contempt. He lifted the bottle and took another steady pull, before finding two more pills to down with a shrug. 

The world around him began to tilt, edges blurring into a comforting oblivion as he grinned at the thought of feeling nothing. Rising on quaking legs he leaned against the dining table and swayed his way over to the journal where he scrawled one last entry. His gaze drifted over to the corner of the room, at an empty object that he could never part with and yet tore his heart out with every viewing. He didn’t look at the words left on the paper. 

As Kyle stumbled around the room and finished off the bottle he eventually discovered a bottle of cough syrup and consumed that as well. As a Herculean feat, he hoisted himself back into his chair and collapsed into it. Every breath seemed a bit slower than the last, and his thoughts became aborted syllables echoing throughout an empty mind. Only one last thought broke though- had he taken too much?

As he leaned back, his eyes fluttered shut for the last time. From the doorway, what remained of him watched the scene with baleful, distant eyes. He watched the memory play out. He watched the broken man die in that chair. He cautiously approached the table, eyes welling with tears as they read the last words left in the journal.
We were going to name her Laura. 

The floor gave out beneath him and Kyle fell to his knees, eyes now coming to rest on the shattered crib in the corner of the decaying room. He released a raw, anguished cry as the memories all came flooding back. On the floor he shook and wept, recalling the very moment he’d died. It hadn’t been alone in that chair. 
It was in that pale white room in the hospital. 

He struggled to his feet; the lights in the house flickering to reveal a familiar world he imagined and the decaying truth. Settling back into the all too familiar chair he looked beside him, at a bottle of whiskey half full. 

Carl stood in the doorway, watching intently. Kyle’s fingers wrapped around the bottle cap, twisting it off as he brought the glass to his lips. He couldn’t let go. Could never begin to forgive himself for something he didn’t do. One last thought slipped through his mind as the liquor kissed the edge of his tongue, bringing him pause.
Is this what Laura would have wanted?

The bottle fell to the floor of the abandoned house, echoing alone.
