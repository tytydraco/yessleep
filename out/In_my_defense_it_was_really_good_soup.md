I really hesitated to reach out. I came across this website about a month ago and it's been gnawing at the back of my mind since. I had never heard of the term GADHIC and honestly thought it was a conspiracy for a very long time. That is until I had soup. No you don't understand, this was REALLY GOOD SOUP.

I didn't think much of it the first time I had it. People change you know? They grow. They learn new things. Well, most people change: not this circus, not this monkey. The abuse was expected, familiar, hell warm even. She had neglected me for so long that I thought that was all I was worthy of. The harsh words, the rotten meals and the random slaps with her sandal. I think in her mind it was making me into a better person, a man. In reality, I cowered more every day, the light slowly dying in my eyes.

Sorry. I'm doing it again. I'm perseverating. At least that is what my therapist says I do. I think I just think about the things that bother me. And nothing bothers me more than how my mother treats me.

"You gonna eat that?" She sucked her cigarette like it was paying her to. She would ask only moments after serving me slop the temperature of lava. My wanting to let it cool down was unacceptable. If I didn't eat right away, it was snatched up.

I learned to hide ice cubes in my pockets to drop into the molten slop the minute she looked away. It's desperate but my high school stopped providing free breakfast to poor kids, so I turned back to slop for my nourishment. If you asked me how or what this slop was made with, I couldn't begin to tell you. The taste was a mix of hot onion and sweaty ball-sack. Only desperation from starvation kept me consuming it.

Days were counted in bowls of slop consumed, a never ending sisiphysean buffet. Nothing about my existence seemed redeemable, until I found her. Luna. Or more accurately, she found me.

The cat distribution system or whatever decided to shine brightly on me with a tiny black cat with white paws and white chin. Luna was hissing in a bush outside the basketball hoops at school. Her paw was trapped in some mangled soccer net. I cut her paw free with my pocket knife and hid her in my hoodie. She gently snuggled against my stomach and purred. Is this what love feels like? I wondered.

The next few days I found ways to feed her. I stole a couple of cans from the grocery store where I work. I know, I know. It's wrong. Please don't crucify me. I just couldn't let my little baby die. She is growing and she needs the good stuff. I refuse to feed my daughter slop. I loved her deeply and wanted the best for her.

I wondered at this as the new bowl of my punishment was placed before me. My mother suckled her cigarette like it was her mother's teat and blew the smoke in my face. "Eat" she demanded.

"Do you love me?" I asked.

"What did you just ask me?" She snarled, the cigarette hanging for dear life from her lips.

"Do. You. Love. Me." I repeated.

"HOW DARE YOU" She threw the entire pot of slop at my head. I narrowly dodged. Realizing she had inadvertently answered my question, I ran towards the door. But she was faster. She grabbed me by the collar.

"You will EAT and you will LIKE it. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

"Get off of me." I struggled as she pulled me with superhuman strength and forced me to sit.

You know how when you regret a moment, it is physically burned into your memory? As an evolutionary drive your mind tries and tries to go back, to find a way to fix it? You know there is no way to fix it, but you hold onto it as a way to hopefully prevent tragedy in the future?

This moment with my mother is forever burned into my memory.

Luna, my brave, my sweet, my daughter. After having her for a little over a week, came out like a lion, to protect me. She sensed the danger and she charged my mother full on, digging her claws into the leathery skin. My mother saw Luna as she saw me, nothing more than a pest. She threw Luna so hard against the wall she threw away the kitten's life with no thought at all.

The tears came and wouldn't stop. I held my small lifeless daughter in my hands. She would never grow, never know joy.  My mind broke. I believe that was when the hallucinations started. Probably the trauma from losing the only thing I loved in life.

It started with strange yellow eyes in the forest watching me as I laid Luna to rest in a shallow grave adorned with wilting flowers no one bought from my work. I would go daily to her grave, cry and then come home to eat my slop.

Until that day, three weeks later, when I saw Luna again. Everything looked the same, down to her tiny white paws and white chin. I realized I must be hallucinating. Cats can't resurrect from the dead, let alone talk. She purred gently at me. "Papa?" She asked.

I scooped her into my arms and cried. "Yes. Yes. I'm your papa."

Luna returned home with me and I was better at hiding her from my mother. Until one day my mom had to do the monthly grocery shopping. Luna sat in my lap as I struggled to eat my reheated slop.

"Soup?" Luna asked inquisitively. My daughter was very smart and had learned many words.

"No Luna. This is slop. It's not good." I wretched at the smell.

"Papa needs good soup." Luna responded.

"One day. My mom won't make me anything but this. She hates me." I gently pet her cheek. "But I will only feed you the best. Because I love you Luna. You are my baby."

"Luna baby" She purred.

"Yes, Luna baby."

"One day, Luna Mommy."

"One day when you are grown you can have your own kids, yes. And you can give them good soup."

"Good soup." She pressed her head against my face and settled into my lap to nap.

The next day I looked everywhere for Luna. I couldn't find her. I was convinced my mother was behind it. She never let me have anything that made me happy.

I rushed into the kitchen, my eyes filled with tears, baseball bat in my hand. My mom sat at the kitchen table with a gentle smile. Her face seemed 10 years younger and she wasn't smoking. Her clothes were clean and bright.

I slowly dropped the baseball bat and sat at the table across from her, dumbfounded. What was happening?

She slowly pushed a bowl towards me. It was filled to the brim. I instinctively winced until the smell caught my nose. It was sweet and savory. My eyes opened to see a golden cream colored soup with chopped onions, potatoes, kidney beans and shredded chicken. She even garnished it with cilantro and cheese.

"What is this?" I asked skeptically.

"Good soup" She smiled.

I tasted it. It was divine. I stared at my mother. Something about her face was not quite right, not entirely human. But the deep hunger in me for sustenance became unbearable and I devoured the soup.

"It's very good." I responded. "Thank you."

My mother stood up and came over to me. She gently pressed her forehead against mine.

"Mommy loves you." The words shocked me but as she pulled away I swore I could hear the soft sound of purring.

The creature I live with is not my mother. I don't know what it is and I don't know where my real mother is. But at this point, I don't care. She loves me. She always makes me good soup.
