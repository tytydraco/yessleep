To this day, my friend and I still can not wrap my head around what happened.

My friend and I just got done eating dinner with my mom. She had revently broke up with her boyfriend of a year and needed to let her anger and sadness out. 

We left my house and decided to take a short drive to the lake in our town. We parked facing towards the lake in the spaces closest to it, allowing us to peer down the small hill that lead to the dock. 

The parking lot was dim-lit and the road behind us had little to no traffic on it as it was around 11 pm. 

We sat in the parking lot for about 30 minutes, talking about her breakup and what all went down. I was staring in my rear view mirror and suddenly became fixated on two cars entering. I was a little bit scared at first, thinking it was cops. It was past curfew and we were not allowed to be here and it was known that high schoolers came here to drink and smoke. However, it was just a 2013 red charger and a 1993 honda accord. 

I pointed them out to my friend and laughed, unnerved, laughing about how it was probably a drug deal. It wasn’t uncommon to see these go down a lot in our town. 

We try to continue our conversation, but I can’t seem to keep my eyes off the two cars that showed up, parked only 15-20 feet away from
us. 

My heart rate starts picking up as we watch a man get out of the red charger. He was a white man, medium build, average height, bald head, wearing all black clothes. 

Nobody emerged from the honda accord. We watch in silence as the man turns around, his eyes gazing at our car. He not too long after turns and starts walking towards the road behind us, about 30 feet away from us. We are turned around in our seats, watching him walk away until he reaches about 15 feet away. 

Our nerves calm down and I turn back to face my friend so we can start to resume our previous conversation. As soon as I do, there is a soft knock on the driver window, where I am seated. I flip around fast, appalled the man we watched walk away from us is suddenly right at my window.

I stare in shock at him, noticing how bright and piercing his blue eyes were. He holds a smile on his face, but not a normal friendly smile. A smile that doesn’t fully show his teeth, his eyes looking at me slightly through his eyelashes. The scariest part was this man had nothing behind his eyes. No emotions. No humanity. 

He knocks again. I look at my friend, frozen in fear on what to do. She is no help, also frozen. 

(I am not sure why I did this next thing and I am so blessed it did not amount to anything more sinister)

I roll down the window very slightly, hardly a crack that not even a finger could poke through. 

“Yes?” I ask him, shaking in fear. 

“Do you know what time it is?” He asks, in a low rough voice. 

I look at the clock on my dash, “11:41…” 

He stands there, smile still plastered on his face, not breaking eye contact, not blinking.

“…Thank you.”

The man walks backgrounds, staring at us as he goes. 

My friend and I turn to each other, freaking out about what just happened. We watch the man walk down the hill towards the dock and focus our attention on the honda accord still parked.

The car shifts to drive and slowly drives towards the exit, the driver continuously breaking suddenly. They are parked beneath a light, only illuminating the shadow of the driver. 

They sit still, staring straight toward, not moving at all. We watch in silence for a total of 5 minutes before the person finally drives off.

Horrified at the experience, we decide to leave and started heading towards a park not too far away. 

We chalked the man up to a drug dealer trying to check out if we were cops or a sex trafficker. 

We were totally unaware what occurred at the lake was only the beginning of the night.

The drive to the park doesn’t take us too long. When we park, we drive to the very end of the parking lot, far away from the entrance. No other car is in sight.

We finally calm ourselves down and try to shake off the experience we just had. My friend continues telling me about her ex, getting more emotional as we speak.

After awhile, we change topics. The mood is still sad, but I am trying my best to lighten her up. 

As I look at her, I suddenly see a figure about 15 feet away from my car. It appears to be a man, however, you can’t see anything but the stature. 

I point him out to my friend in shock, not being able to utter a single word. Her eyes wander over to him and as soon as she sees him, she is also silent in shock. 

You can clearly see his body moving, up and down as if he is breathing erratically. 

Millions of thoughts race through my head as suddenly, his body starts…twitching. The best way I can describe it is like in one of those possession horror movies.

My friend starts to laugh, but it isn’t a laugh at something funny. It is a scared laugh. This is the first time I have seen her scared. 

“What is he doing?” She asks, her voice trembling.

I open my mouth to answer, but before I could, the figure starts sprinting at my car, full speed.

A scream escaped my lips as I was quickly go into my flight response, throwing my car into reverse and swinging out of the parking spot. I then throw it into drive and speed as fast as I can to the exit. 

We sit at the exit, stopped and look in my mirrors, no longer seeing the man. Seeing absolutely nothing.

We sit in silence before my friend asks, “Should we go back?”

Im not sure why I agreed. Something about that place just pulled us straight back in.

I agree and we drive back to our spot, looking around paranoid. Nobody to be seen.

About five minutes passes and I stare out at the small slope of a hill that leads to the parking lot.

My friend suddenly gasps, pointing out a figure that looks as big as a toddler.

“What is a baby doing out here all alone at midnight?”

Before I can reply, we watch in horror as the toddler sized person suddenly grows a couple of feet and becomes the man we saw earlier.

We watch in horror as what happened before, happens again.

He starts twitching before sprinting at my car in full speed. We both let out screams of horror, reversing and driving away as fast as we can.

We stop in the middle of the parking lot, watching out of our mirrors as the man stopped running after us and just stands there, staring straight at us. 

This is the part where I still doubt myself, I can not believe we both saw this. Nothing can explain this. We were completely sober. 

The man suddenly steps sideways, and at the same time he does, another figure, identical, steps the other way. 

They make no other movements, but to walk separate ways, both disappearing into the dark.

My friend starts crying, unsure of how to comprehend what we just saw. 

I shake in terror, unsure I should even drive right now, knowing I could focus on nothing but what we just saw.

Before I can make that decision, though, we both hear, clear as day, a pair of heavy footsteps running towards the drive side door. 

We both start screaming again, tears falling as we peel out of the parking lot, getting as far away from that park as we can. 

The drive to her house was in complete silence, both of us unsure of what to say. 

We take the back roads, not wanting to drive on the highway after the experience we just had.

“Are you okay?” She asks me, trembling.

Before I can answer, I feel a finger graze the back of my neck and a water bottle on the back seat get kicked. 

“I’m not trying to freak you out…” She whispers. “But I just felt someone stroke my hair…”

My eyes cautiously wander up to the rear view mirror and I start having a panic attack as I see a dark figure sitting in my back seat. 

She made me pull over to calm down, knowing that if I continued, we would crash. 

It takes a total of 10 minutes before I am able to fully calm down, the man in the back gone. 

To this day, I am not sure what we witnessed. Whether it was humans messing with us or a dark entity. 

All I know, is that if that figure got to us, only sinister things would’ve happened.
