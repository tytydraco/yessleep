There will be two parts. So much happened this night. I will try and upload it tomorrow. 

This is a true story. To this day, my friend and I still can not wrap my head around what happened.

My friend and I just got done eating dinner with my mom. She had revently broke up with her boyfriend of a year and needed to let her anger and sadness out. 

We left my house and decided to take a short drive to the lake in our town. We parked facing towards the lake in the spaces closest to it, allowing us to peer down the small hill that lead to the dock. 

The parking lot was dim-lit and the road behind us had little to no traffic on it as it was around 11 pm. 

We sat in the parking lot for about 30 minutes, talking about her breakup and what all went down. I was staring in my rear view mirror and suddenly became fixated on two cars entering. I was a little bit scared at first, thinking it was cops. It was past curfew and we were not allowed to be here and it was known that high schoolers came here to drink and smoke. However, it was just a 2013 red charger and a 1993 honda accord. 

I pointed them out to my friend and laughed, unnerved, laughing about how it was probably a drug deal. It wasn’t uncommon to see these go down a lot in our town. 

We try to continue our conversation, but I can’t seem to keep my eyes off the two cars that showed up, parked only 15-20 feet away from
us. 

My heart rate starts picking up as we watch a man get out of the red charger. He was a white man, medium build, average height, bald head, wearing all black clothes. 

Nobody emerged from the honda accord. We watch in silence as the man turns around, his eyes gazing at our car. He not too long after turns and starts walking towards the road behind us, about 30 feet away from us. We are turned around in our seats, watching him walk away until he reaches about 15 feet away. 

Our nerves calm down and I turn back to face my friend so we can start to resume our previous conversation. As soon as I do, there is a soft knock on the driver window, where I am seated. I flip around fast, appalled the man we watched walk away from us is suddenly right at my window.

I state in shock at him, noticing how bright and piercing his blue eyes were. He holds a smile on his face, but not a normal friendly smile. A smile that doesn’t fully show his teeth, his eyes looking at me slightly through his eyelashes.

He knocks again. I look at my friend, frozen in fear on what to do. She is no help, also frozen. 

(I am not sure why I did this next thing and I am so blessed it did not amount to anything more sinister)

I roll down the window very slightly, hardly a crack that not even a finger could poke through. 

“Yes?” I ask him, shaking in fear. 

“Do you know what time it is?” He asks, in a low rough voice. 

I look at the clock on my dash, “11:41…” 

He stands there, smile still plastered on his face, not breaking eye contact, not blinking.

“…Thank you.”

The man walks backgrounds, staring at us as he goes. 

My friend and I turn to each other, freaking out about what just happened. We watch the man walk down the hill towards the dock and focus our attention on the honda accord still parked.

The car shifts to drive and slowly drives towards the exit, the driver continuously breaking suddenly. They are parked beneath a light, only illuminating the shadow of the driver. 

They sit still, staring straight toward, not moving at all. We watch in silence for a total of 5 minutes before the person finally drives off.

Horrified at the experience, we decide to leave and started heading towards a park not too far away. 

We chalked the man up to a drug dealer trying to check out if we were cops or a sex trafficker. 

We were totally unaware what occurred at the lake was only the beginning of the night.
