After my fiancé and I broke up, and after she carried the last of her belongings out of our co-leased apartment—the silence of the place began to take shape. We’d always cherished that quiet, especially at night, grateful that neither upstairs nor downstairs ever seemed to have anyone living there. We had been together for almost three years and had already chosen names for our unborn children. 
 
The rooms now felt hollow, as if something essential had been peeled away with her departure. It wasn’t a surprise, I just had never experienced anything like it.
 
A few weeks later, I found myself standing on the balcony of the tenth floor, on the wrong side of the railing, staring down into the black void of the courtyard. The only light came from tiny orange streetlamps scattered below like dying embers. Sirens eventually lit up the courtyard, painting the walls in flashes of red and blue. Fire trucks. Ambulance. Police. People gathered, someone shouted.
 
I don’t know what changed. Maybe I realized that letting go wouldn’t just end the pain—it would erase everything else too. Every happy memory. The version of me that existed before her that still had something to give. Or maybe it was simply being afraid of falling, in a primitive, animal way.
 
In the mental hospital they diagnosed me with severe depression and put me on antidepressants. It felt like hitting rock bottom only to discover a trapdoor underneath.
 
The only thing that kept me from dissolving entirely was my job. I’m a legal associate with a reputation, with the expectation of competence. I couldn’t lose that—not on top of everything else. So I lied. I called the office from the hospital and claimed I needed emergency surgery, something urgent and vague enough that no one would question it. They approved my absence. I felt relief, but with an equal amount of shame.
 
When I was released, I returned to my life expecting… I don’t know. Some kind of emotional detox. A reset. A clean slate. Classic BS I did not believe but had to since there was no alternative. Not anymore.
 
The silence in the apartment greeted me stronger than before. As if my bad thoughts had diluted its true nature until now. It wasn’t ordinary quiet. It had weight—like it pressed outward from the walls in slow, rhythmic pulses, as though something behind them was breathing too deeply. The sensation was worst in the bedroom, the cramped little space where the two of us used to sleep curled together on that ridiculous too-small bed we deliberately kept, knowing it forced us to sleep tightly against one another.
 
But life somehow kept going and sooner than ever I was on a paid leave studying for my bar exam. The last step to lawyerhood and hopefully a chance of some success in life.  
 
And then it started a couple of weeks ago.
 
Footsteps.
 
They came from the apartment above, always in the dead of night. At first they were simple, steady steps—loud enough to wake me instantly since I’m a light sleeper. I didn’t give them much thought the first few nights, since the footsteps lasted only ten paces before the silence rushed back in. But after they kept repeating on a regular basis at almost exactly the same time, they began to feel deliberate, almost malevolent, as though they were addressed to me.
 
The last couple of nights, the footsteps changed. The pattern loosened. Quickened. They began to circle and swoop across the ceiling. A strange, lilting rhythm crept into them—too erratic to be walking, yet too gleeful to be anything else. It sounded like… dancing.
 
Not joyful dancing.
Not the kind you’d see at a wedding or a club.
 
No—this had an edge to it. A malicious playfulness, almost cartoonish. The sort of delighted cruelty horror movies ascribe to demonic presences, relishing the slow and gradual torment of their household victims.
 
Each night it grew longer, more frenzied. By Tuesday, it had been going on for several minutes, scraping my sanity down to raw wire. I couldn’t pretend anymore. I needed sleep for my bar exam. I needed sanity for everything else.
 
Fueled by a mix of anger and dread—and something else, something like curiosity but sharper and colder—I put on trousers, marched upstairs, and rang the doorbell.
 
Once.
Twice.
 
I leaned in, ear against the door. The dancing hadn’t stopped. It didn’t even hesitate.
 
I held the bell down for ten full seconds, the harsh buzzing echoing loudly throughout the hallway. The noise stopped.
 
Good, I thought. Finally.
 
However, I didn’t hear footsteps approaching the door. No shift of weight. Nothing.
 
I rang again. Again. My insistence felt childish and desperate, but I wanted to hear something-an explanation. 
 
The silence pressed thickly against the door.
 
Then, right on the other side of it—less than a meter away from where I was standing—the dance started again.
 
It slammed into the hallway like a shout. Fast, wild, viciously jubilant. I jumped back, heart clawing up my throat. My hand hit the wall.
 
I pounded on the door, shouting, cursing—anything to drown out the thing thrashing and spinning inches away. My voice cracked, thin and useless, like in a nightmare where you want to scream but can’t force the sound out.
 
A door across the hall burst open. My neighbor glared at me, bleary-eyed, demanding to know why I was making noise in the middle of the night. His countenance held something else too—something familiar— like the wary, uneasy look people give to someone they suspect is losing their mind.
 
I tried to explain. But as I spoke, behind me there was silence. Zero movement. 
 
He stared at me like I was slipping again.
 
I walked back downstairs feeling small and burning with shame. Shame that reminded me of the balcony, of the mental hospital, of not knowing who found out, who talked about it afterwards.
 
The night before last, there was no dancing. I dared to hope. I even slept.
 
All of this brings me to last night. 
 
I woke up to the dancing again. But the noise sounded… different. Off. It took me a moment to understand why, a moment in which my brain tried to force the sounds back to where they belonged—above me, contained, distant.
 
But they weren’t above me.
 
The dancing was coming from the other room. 
 
For a few seconds I was frozen, my mind refusing to accept it, as if reality needed time to buffer. Rage eventually kicked in. I got up, opened the bedroom door, and flicked on the lights, bracing myself for whatever waited there.
 
It took me a moment to understand what I was looking at.
 
It was me.
 
I was standing in the middle of the room, dancing—wearing familiar clothing I used to wear back in my college days. Wildly, gleefully, with that same frantic, malicious rhythm I’d heard for nights. And “I” was staring straight at me while doing it, smiling—a stretched, impossible grin, like the one from the movie Smile, but twisted, exaggerated, too wide, too knowing.
 
I screamed. Slapped the door shut. Locked it.
 
My hands pressed against my ears, hard enough to hurt, trying to muffle the sound of my own footsteps—my own body—thrashing and skipping in the next room. I sat on the floor, shaking, waiting for it to stop, however long it took. Waiting for the sun to rise.
 
Eventually it did stop. Well after 10 a.m., I finally left my bedroom and opened the door to find the room empty—no trace of someone being there at all.
 
That was enough for me.
 
I called my landlord once I could steady my voice. I told her the upstairs neighbor was making too much noise at night, that I couldn’t study, that I needed sleep for my bar exam. She sympathized and accepted the termination without pressing for details. She is good people.
 
I’ve managed to move almost all my stuff back to my parents until I find a new apartment. The idea of spending even one more night there—alone, in the dark, with that thing potentially appearing in my bedroom next time—was unbearable.
 
Still… even as I write this, I don’t know if moving will fix anything.
 
I keep replaying last night. The figure in the living room. The grin. My old clothes. The way it moved as if thrilled that I was watching. I keep trying to force a rational explanation onto it, because the alternative is unbearable.
 
I must have been hallucinating.
I must have been dreaming.
I must still be sick.
 
Right?
 
That’s why I’m writing this. Why I’m sharing it. Because I need someone—anyone—to tell me what this sounds like. I cannot risk another coerced confinement by sharing this with anyone I know or by seeing a specialist.
 
Is it the breakup?
The trauma?
Some kind of delayed shock?
Could the antidepressants cause something like this—visual hallucinations, auditory ones, something that vivid?
 
Or did I bring something back with me from that night on the balcony—from the moment I looked down at the courtyard and thought about letting go? Did something see me then? Did something step through the crack I made in myself?
 
I don’t know. I genuinely don’t.
 
What scares me most is this thought I can’t shake:
 
If it was all in my head, then wherever I go… it can follow.
 
And if it wasn’t—if it wasn’t just a hallucination—
then it can follow me just the same.
