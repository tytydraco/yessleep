Well, to start off, I should say what my occupation is. I used to be a delivery driver–well, I still am, just not in the traditional ‘delivering mail and goods to suburban homes’ sense. 

I was fired from that job. I can admit it was my fault; I had been caught stealing packages from my own van. I don’t regret it. 

Customers always got refunds or a replacement sent their way due to their package being ‘lost in transit’. 

But I had to make a living and put bread on the table for my family, and when the job wasn’t paying enough, the pawn shop pulled through. 

My wife did the best she could during those times of living check to check. Many of our meals were sacrificed so our children could eat. 

Getting fired seemed like a death sentence, and it was through my shady and short term solution of obtaining some extra cash that I ultimately felt like I had dug four graves.

It was my friend, Jason, who saved our family from our financial struggle. He’s an ex-marine, employed by a private military company, and had more connections than I had previously assumed. 

You’d think he was an angel with how damn quiet and polite he is all the time. But I promise you, under that shining halo, tucked under those white feathered wings, there’s blood money. 

He never told me what type of operations he exactly did. I got the sense the reason for this was less because he has some sort of NDA and more likely those memories are tucked away behind several mental locks.

But Jason, like me, was in a tough spot. Especially after leaving the United States Military. He needed money, and so he used the skills he possessed to make as much as he could. 

I think that’s why he suggested the job to me. He could see I was in the same place he was. Although in my case I have two kids relying on me. 

We met at a local bar to talk shop. As he explained it; 

“This job will be just like your old one but easier! You could be making half of seven figures… if you choose your battles right” 

Of course I thought he was bullshitting me; no delivery job could offer money like that. I know now that he was telling the truth. Not all of it, but the truth nonetheless.

A few weeks ago was the first time I attempted a higher risk delivery. Since I’m fairly new, I’ve only been allowed to accept lower risk stuff—guns, drugs, stolen goods; banal contraband. 

We’re not really supposed to look at what we’re delivering but it’s not hard to guess when you’re crossing borders and are explicitly told to follow road laws to a T before arriving at isolated warehouses and factories with hidden inventories.

But since I’ve completed all of my deliveries with no issues for the past several months the opportunities for me have expanded from pennies and nickels to Benjamin’s. 

Of course once I was eligible to deliver the crème de la crop of deliveries I aimed for the stars and accepted the most expensive I could find.

How my job works is very simple: I drive somewhere to pick up a package, I then drive with the package to the customer and deliver it at the drop off, then I ditch the vehicle.

Either way, the job's simple if you don’t think too hard about it and I feel lucky to have found it after having been laid off.

Except this damn high paying delivery. I understand now why it paid so well—practically the pay of 15 standard deliveries. 

I had to drive all the way across the US from the midwest, where I live, to the western deserts to access the pickup spot.

As my agent told me over the radio, the van containing the package would be waiting in an isolated and abandoned factory. 

It was kind of uncanny seeing a clean black Mercedes sprinter van so lonely in the gutted architecture.

More details of the delivery are found once you enter the delivery vehicle. There’s a mounted tablet on the dash with the route to the destination preloaded (tablet is also destroyed along with the van).

When I first started out, I’d enter the cargo area to see the package I was delivering. But I’ve seen enough to stop caring. Or at least force myself to stop caring. 

However, because this was such a high paying delivery, it was just too enticing. 

When I was settling into the driver's seat I spotted in the rear view mirror, angled through a window in the vans partition, a singular metal crate strapped to the vans floor. 

This wasn’t shocking, but it did set off a spiraling curiosity within me. Normally I would deliver crates of bulk goods and now I was receiving a fraction of a CEO’s salary for driving around a 2x2x3 foot crate.

And oddly enough, with the scarce glances I did take at the crate, there looked to be breathing holes scattered over its surface.

I played the guessing game in my head as I drove the van out of the factory.

Is this thing radioactive hence the thick steel walls? Obviously this job is more dangerous hence the higher pay. Was it a bomb that could explode at any moment? Was it the chopped up corpse of some high up government official? 

My tires left the disheveled pavement and hit the clean tarmac of the main road I’d be driving down for the next few hours.

I settled on a nearly exotic animal.

———————————————————————————

For a few hours everything remained boring, just as I liked it. 

I periodically glanced in the rear view mirror at the box that was held still with metal and rope. Nothing about it had changed. It was inoffensively innate and not a single sound had emitted from the thing.

I tried accelerating over a pothole to see if I could get some type of reaction only to be left with a sore butt. 

I was driving through some middle-of-nowhere desert across a winding mountain side when I got a call on my satellite phone. It was my agent, as I like to call him–he tells me to refer to him as Conrad, though. 

He was the one who proposed the jobs like a glorified Doordash app. Agent Conrad is also the person I report everything to. In this instance he was calling for a routine check in.

“Hello Z, I see you’re three hours into your route. Everything’s cool so far?” Conrad asked.

“Smooth sailin’, just tedious. Haven’t seen nothin’ but sand and dirt for miles. Got a few vultures interested in the van–hadda’ shake em off my tail.” I chuckled.

“If anything else starts following you just let me know. You have over a day's drive and we trust you to complete this delivery without complications.” Conrad gave his earnestly unhumorous response as usual. I hung up the phone.

What I didn’t know was there would, in fact, be a complication, and it revealed itself with a horrid, scraggly voice.

“SaNd aND dIRt…”

I didn’t know it at the time, but then and there I should have pulled that van over and called my agent. It was just quiet enough that I debated, for longer than I’d like to admit, whether it was in my head. 

I resumed the drive in silence, still examining the small metal crate through the partition’s window. 

‘Maybe the noise came from the satellite phone?’ I thought to myself. 

It could’ve been some odd feedback glitch from the conversation with Conrad. But when I glanced at the satellite phone on the passenger seat it was off. I even tried turning down the already muted radio.

And then it spoke again.

“SanD aNd DIRt sANd anD DIrT saNd aNd dirT Sand AND–.”

The voice behind me, behind the partition, grumbled rapidly and fluctuated in pitch and speed like a rewinding vhs tape.

It came from the metal crate

Out of pure reaction from the absurdity of the sound, I spun myself to look at the cargo area. I took my eyes off the road for one damn moment. Just to see nothing but a dormant crate. 

None of this would’ve happened if I sat still and ignored the voice.

I should’ve expected this; it was a high paying delivery after all. Something was going to throw me off. But I fell for the bait.

 Before I could even set my eyes back on the pavement my tires had already left behind I was heading toward a steep and jagged cliffside. 

I swerved as hard as I could as the wall of rock plummeted toward me. This might have not been the best maneuver I could’ve done, but it likely saved me. Instead of crashing head on at 65mph my van caught the lip where it connected to the ground and drove up it like a steep ramp.

At some point the van flipped sideways, as I recall from the aftermath. I woke up probably an hour after the crash hot and thirsty and with a banging headache. Other than that, I was fine. Physically, at least. 

Because when I checked the cargo to see if it was intact I realized it slammed through the now chasmed ceiling and had cracked open when it landed on the ground, partially buried beneath the sand.

‘I just destroyed the cargo for a 6 figure delivery’. I thought to myself.

I pushed through the headache to crawl out of the van and limp over to the corpse of the metal crate, hoping to see its contents (whatever they were) would still be in one piece.

My hopes were crushed when all I saw was a lump of some type of pale goop spilled and dried up among the sand. I took the opportunity to examine it, though. It was nothing like I had seen before.

At my old job, I once delivered to a home with a mountain of packages out front. Worried, I checked the package dates to see that some of the envelopes and boxes were almost a month old. 

When I walked up to their front door to knock I smelled what I could only describe as pure rot. The smell of death. That’s the scent this rough monotone blob emitted.

As I continued gawking at it, I noticed something else. There were footprints in the sand. 

Well, rather, it looked like someone had dragged themselves through the sand only to stand up moments later and walk away on bare feet through the searing sand. 

Yet, there were no footprints heading toward the crate.

With the pounding headache, dehydration, and anxiety of the situation, I was perplexed. There was no way a person could have fit in that small container. 

And it didn’t matter if they did or didn’t; they’re walking in 100+ temperatures on scalding ground. And to add onto my confusion, I was afraid.

I wasn’t just afraid of being fired. This was more than that. My employers were secretive. If I was caught and was found delivering something under illegal circumstances, which this and all of my deliveries most definitely were, I’m going to prison where I’ll probably be the victim of a hit.

 And that’s if the government gets to me first. Fear is on a whole nother level when you don’t know what it is you’re supposed to be afraid of.

So, I grabbed my backpack from the wreckage with presumably enough food and water for the journey and immediately began following the mystery footprints.

I didn’t know who or what I was looking for, but I was going to find it. I would figure out from there how I would get the package back without a weapon if they were armed.

I admit, what I was doing was stupid. It was blisteringly hot out and I was wandering out in the desert wilderness. The footsteps seemed to go on forever, too. 

Everytime I reached the top of a hill I hoped I’d see the person making these footprints, but they disappeared into the endless horizon.

Any fear I had of becoming lost, of succumbing to dehydration, to the intense heat of the afternoon sun, was all overshadowed by the chilling conclusions of what my employers would do if I didn’t report back with anything satisfactory. 

And I had a very long stroll to think about this.

———————————————————————————

My conclusions devoured me more than the intense UV ate at my skin, yet it fed my fears and pushed me to keep marching through scorching grains that absorbed my shoes and the hollow wind that pushed against me, as if telling me to turn back.

Several hours into walking I found some cacti, specifically the ones with the little pink fruits growing from their top, and remembered they contained water in them. 

I figured I’d grab one to reserve supplies. My fingers danced along its peel, removing sharp pricks as I followed the footprints.

As I was peeling the fruit, I tripped so hard I almost fell face first. I didn’t really expect there to be anything out here to trip over, but there was. 

It was when I recovered from my fall and looked on ahead that I realized something odd about the endless desert in front of me. 

There were no more footsteps. Only flat smooth dunes and a cacti that caught my fall.

I pulled a few pins out of my hand as I turned to see what I tripped over. And there, on the sand and dirt, was a naked man, lying face down, partially buried beneath the earth. 

I had expected the thief to be more equipped for this environment. Maybe some biker wearing leather, or some type of federal agent or private military even. But no; just ass to the heavens naked. 

But something was off about this man. I felt scared being near him. Scared and oddly remorseful. Not in the sense there was a dead body, but like someone close to me had died.

His skin was shriveled as if life's liquids had been drained. Besides the shock I felt, I also felt pity for him. He was left without dignity nor history and all that remained of his lonely corpse was skin and bone.

And when I flipped the body over to see if he was covering the package, that’s when I realized two mind bending things. 

He was not carrying a package. This dead man was me. 

I felt a lot of different emotions then. I was in grief at the sight of my dead self, I was paralyzed with confusion at how what I was seeing was possible, and all of the fear for the repercussions of my crash now changed to that of the decaying copy.

I didn’t know whether I should head back and call Conrad or stay here with the body. Contemplated over it for maybe too long. But I decided there was no other choice, so I began my long journey back.

———————————————————————————

It took a lot in me not to look back as I followed my own previously laid path toward the wrecked van. 

I hadn’t brought the satellite phone with me, and in the stress of it all, I think I left it there on purpose to prevent myself from calling without finding out what happened to the package. 

But I had seen enough now, more than enough, and I just wanted… safety? To know that my job was alright? I think what kept pushing me to move forward was my family, or at least that’s what I’d like to believe.

I hadn’t known how long I had been walking, but the sky was purple and orange as the sun prepared to set. Soon I would be in total darkness. 

I didn’t even know how far a walk remained till I reached the van. There was nothing familiar among the banal desert to serve as a checkpoint.

That was until I noticed something I had seen before. Its long shadow stretched across the dunes as the sun lured behind, silhouetting its figure. Dark arms enveloped me as they traversed across the sand.

It was the cactus, the one I had taken fruit from. My lips dried intensely at the site of its pink pears. I jogged over and yanked a fruit adjacent to the spot where I previously stole its sweet, nourishing offer.

I didn’t care about the pins that stuck out from its skin as my chalky fingers worked away to unveil its juicy insides. But I was met with disappointment. 

It was rotten. The soft white inside had turned into a brown mushy gore that smelled putrid. I gagged as my senses were assaulted by what I thought was my salvation.

And as I dropped the fruit onto the ground the sand quickly devoured that which I had denied to.

The evening winds accelerated the grains, and I realized something that froze me in place. 

The only set of footsteps were the ones I had just made. There were none walking toward the body, away from the sun, let alone the bare feet I had been chasing.

This wasn’t the cactus from earlier.

In a panic, I turned immediately to follow my footsteps backward in the hopes I’d find the path I had taken before, but they were vanishing as rapidly as the sun.

I stopped, breathed for a moment, gathered my thoughts, and made a mental footnote of where the sun was, since that was where I was walking anyways, before it vanished beyond the horizon. 

I wished that trail had remained, though. The night was freezing cold and it was hard to maintain a sense of direction with my head down avoiding the wind.

‘That had to be the cactus’ I thought to myself. It looked the same and even had a blemish where I previously picked fruit from it. But there were no signs of prints before the wind picked up.  So why weren’t they there?

The numbness of my nose, ears, and fingers made me forget the thought as quickly as I summoned it. It didn’t matter. All that mattered was I got back to the van and hoped the heater still worked.

It must’ve been an hour of walking before I stopped feeling my toes. I always thought the desert was hot 24/7, but I guess when it’s Spring there’s still room for temperatures to drop below freezing.

As I continued to, what I hoped was, in the direction of the van, every now and then I would hear a slight disturbance in the sand behind me.

It sounded like someone swiping the palm of their hand across jeans. It was bizarre enough to gain my attention. 

I couldn’t shake the odd feeling that I was being followed. Because the noise grew closer every few minutes. Everytime I would turn around, though, there would be nothing. Just a shallow view of sand, sand, and more sand.

I kept walking. Allowed the noise to grow closer. My eyes planted forward, refusing to glance at the black abyss behind and instead focus on the one ahead
.
I could swear it was right next to my boot.

I stomped with jolting movement.

There was a shriek and a familiar rattle as something definitely caught the rubber of my boot. I looked down to see a snake attempting to bite into the steel toe.

My boot sent it soaring into the void. Hopefully it slithered away, I thought to myself. I continued walking forward and experienced something yet again familiar. 

The smell of rot. I became more cautious with my footsteps, inching slowly across the sand until my eyes adjusted to the camouflage scales. The snake lied still belly up.

Its muscles twitched… gross. But then it began vibrating. Vibrating so fast the sand beneath it bounced up and down in waves. Its belly bubbled, splitting open as a shapeless figure scurried from the scaled carcass, half the size of the snake.

It skittered across the ground into the darkness.

‘What in the hell was that, The Thing?’ I thought to myself.

I was shaking even more now. Not just from the cold, but from the fear that It could appear anywhere. Just lunge out from the dark unannounced. 

Maybe I wouldn’t even see it before It grappled onto me and morphed my body or something.

No matter what I did, how fast I swiveled my head, tensed my body to fight it off, nothing alleviated the adrenaline that now overtook any crippling numbness from cold and fear.

I moved awkwardly, wanting to walk cautiously yet my legs wanting to sprint. My mind and body contradicted each other.

It didn’t move very far. A few steps later I watched it as it enlarged and then shrunk to its half foot size as if it were breathing. It just sat there. It smelled horrible. I didn’t know what it was, but it was definitely a living thing. 

Was this what accompanied me for hours in that van? What had spoken to me? What had emerged from that cocooned skin? If that was the case it was much smaller now. I was afraid to touch it, but it allowed me to get close with no resistance.

I scooped it up in my satchel and zipped it with the speed of light.

Hopefully, this was it. This is what had escaped from the crate. AndI had it in my grasp. I continued walking. It was much colder. I didn’t really know where I was supposed to go at this point. 

Then a submerged voice emerged from my satchel.

“dirtandsanddirtandsanddirtandsand.” The glob mumbled in a deep baby-like tone.

It was scratching around inside with something rough and solid, like it formed itself into something new and non gelatinous.

I wanted to swing the bag into the ground and stomp on it. But presumably if I wanted to come out of this alive I needed to keep it alive.

There was a family waiting for me. 

If my children hadn’t popped up in my mind as I walked, no more energy to spare, I don’t think I would’ve travelled far enough to see those headlights still on, pointed up the mountain side, to finally feel the heater on my colorless toes, and to gain the strength to call my agent from the satellite phone.

I told Conrad I had lost the package–couldn’t find whatever it was.

They sent someone in a van to pick me up and take me to a hospital. Which they were honest about; I had IV fluids injected in me for the following day or two. 

As we drove across the winding freeways at speeds that made my journey look like a quick Sunday jog in comparative distance, I clutched my satchel closely.

I still have it with me at home. If anything will make me rich, this thing sure will. It hasn’t spoken since that day and the smell is getting worse. Honestly it might be dead. I’ve been too afraid to unzip the satchel.
