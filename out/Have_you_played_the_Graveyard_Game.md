 "I'm bored what do you want to do?" 


 I asked my friends. All of them were just sitting on their phones like I was. I was getting bored quick from scrolling through Tiktok and YouTube. 


 Marcus and Sarah just looked at me and shrugged. TJ just laughed probably at some meme that none of us get. Rebecca was just reading a book. 


 It was Friday night and I didn't want this to be the start of our weekend. Then a memory popped into my head and I got up to grab my stuff. 


 "What are you doing?" TJ asked.


 I smugly looked back at them. "How about we do something more fun?" Sarah then snaps up with a smile on her face. "What are you thinking Mary? Drinks at the bar?" 


 I shake my head. "We are going to play the Graveyard Game." 


 Marcus then looked up since he likes stuff based around the supernatural and going into haunted houses. "Is it spooky?" 


 I nod my head yes at him which makes the others pay more attention. "Basically what you do is go into a graveyard at night with no phones or flashlight and play hide and seek." 


 Marcus then got up. "Sounds like fun! Who's in guys?" Everyone else then got up and grabbed their things. TJ and Rebecca weren't as enthusiastic but they figured to just go along with us. As we were heading out the door Sarah went up beside me and said, "next time I say we go to a bar". 


 We then take a long drive to the city's cemetery. No lights were on which is perfect for the setting. We left our phones in the car and got out. 


 Hemingway Cemetery still looks eerie even at night. The cold wind added to the creepy atmosphere along with the moving trees. There was a strong wind yesterday so there was fallen brush everywhere on the ground. 


 "So who's going to be it?" Rebecca asks.


 "I say we draw branches and whoever got the longest will be it." Marcus replied. 


 We all picked up 5 branches. Then we closed our eyes and picked one at random. TJ got the longest one. He yelled out in enjoyment and went to the closest tree to start counting. We all then ran to our hiding places. 


 Even with the darkness enveloped around us like this I can clearly see my surroundings. I always had a natural talent in seeing better in the dark. That's why my little brother Randy always got mad at me for winning when we were little. 


 I then decided that my hiding spot will be behind an old tree. 


 Whenever I went over there and knelt down the crunch of branches startled me. 


 "10!" 


 I quickly became quite but it was no use as I was found first. I went and stood by the car while TJ finds the others. When it was only Sarah left to find I got a chill breeze on my neck. It felt like someone was blowing air on it. I turned around but no one was there. 


 I shuddered but thought that it was just this graveyard freaking me out. 


 TJ at last found Sarah and she was proud of herself. She said that she hid in a dumpster. Marcus them yelled at her saying that she could get sick from that but she just scoffed from him. Me and Rebecca laughed. 


 I then went to the same tree that TJ was at and started counting. 


 "1!" 


 "2!" 


 "3!" 


 "4!" 


 "5!" 


 I felt that cold breeze on the back of my neck again. I shivered as I still thought of it as nothing. 


 "6!" 


 "7!" 


 "8!"


"9!"


 "10!"


 I then jumped as I didn't even say 10. The voice didn't even sound like my friends. I quickly turned around but no one was there. Freaked out I quickly tried to find them.


 TJ hid himself behind a small hill grove by the pond. Rebecca and Marcus were found behind a grave and a tree. I then put my thinking cap on and went to find Sarah. 


 Whenever we would play these sort of games Sarah would always try to out do the rest of us. I think that's what we like about her. She ain't afraid to get in trouble neither. 


 "Sarah! Sarah!" 


 After a few minutes I quickly gave up on trying to find her. Laughing I saw her up in one of the trees. "Think you can help me down?" She asks still trying to hold in her laughter. 


 When we got back to the others we decided that Sarah would be it as punishment. 


 She didn't like it as she complained but went ahead and counted. 


 "1!"


 "2!"


 "3!"


 "4!" 


 "5!" 


 There was a little pause as she stopped counting but then it resumed. 


 "6!" 


 "7!" 


 "8!" 


 "9!" 


 "10!" 


 I quickly tried not to move. I hid behind a bench that was close to the spot where Marcus hid. He was hiding behind a large rock. 


 It became quite for a bit. The darkness and noise of the wind made me shudder. Marcus kept looking above the rock while mouthing at me where she could be. I just shrugged my shoulders. 


 When it took too lomg me and Marcus just got up and tried to look for everybody. We couldn't see anyone. 


 "Where could they be?" I asked Marcus. 


 "I don't know but i don't like the looks of this". He said. 


 When we got to the car we jumped as all of them jumped out at us from behind the car. They all started laughing when we calmed down and TJ said that he was the one to come up with the idea. 


 "TJ you asshole!" Marcus yelled as he tackled him. 


 After a little bit of tussling around they got off the ground. Marcus then said that he was counting this time. 


 "10!"


 "9!" 


 "8!" 


 "7!"


 "6!" 


 "5!" 


 "4!" 


 "3!" 


  "2!" 


  "1!"


 When he said 1 I hid behind a gravestone a while away. I figured that I was covered enough by that gravestone. But while hiding behind it I felt that cold chill on my neck again


 This time I swung around ready to catch it but no one was there. I went and quickly ducked down. As I did i heard a voice inches away from my ear. 


 "Mary." 


 Now that made me shriek out as Marcus found me. He asked me what was wrong and i told him about the voice. He then said that we should just get out of there and I agreed. 


 As we were all getting in the car laughing and freaked out I just couldn't get that chill feeling behind me. Also who said my name. I didn't know if it was the person whose gravestone I hid behind or if I awoke something in that graveyard. 


 I hope that I will never find out. 


 But it was already too late as Marcus sent a picture in the group chat of the back side of his car. It was a set of handprints. 


 I shuddered as they were right behind the seat that I was in.


 If any of you were in this type of situation what does it mean? Should i look out for any signs that this ghost or spirit followed me home? I will keep you all updated on what happens. Thank you.
