I woke up to my alarm blaring and I groaned. It was a work day and the return to a bit of normalcy was appreciated, but I was still very tired. I was tempted to hit snooze, but I decided to get up and get going. I had not slept well as I spent much of my night wondering what to do about my new friend. Despite the innocent facade, I worried just what Matilda would be capable of. She was possessed of a childlike innocence and desire to please. Yet she also had a ruthless disregard for human life beyond who she proclaimed were her “Friends”

My concerns had to wait for the moment, I had to get to work. I was preparing a quick breakfast to go when I heard something from the living room. I stepped inside and saw Matilda on the shelf where I had left her. She wore a sad expression and there were strange streaks on her cheeks, almost like a woman who had too much makeup on was crying and leaving trails on her face.

I asked her,

“What’s wrong Matilda?”

I heard the soft almost imperceptible whimpering continue for a short moment and then she responded.

“Oh, good morning, well it’s nothing. It....it's just that it gets very lonely in the dark and on this shelf all by myself at night. I was wondering if maybe I could be in the room with you at night. It would be a lot less scary and it would make me feel better. You don’t have to if you don't want, I just think it would be nice.” Once again, my reservations of the danger of the psychic doll took a back seat to my sympathy and I felt bad she had been scared. I also felt guilty I had not thought of it earlier and I told her,

“Of course, I am sorry I had not thought of that. That would be just fine Matilda.”

I heard a strange squeal sound, like the adulation of a young child and then she spoke again,

“You mean it? I promise I won’t be any bother.” I assured her,

“It is fine yes, but I have to get going to work now. Will you be okay here for a while, at least while I am gone?” I was surprised I was asking and I found despite my previous concerns, that I was genuinely considering her feelings before acting.

There was a sound like mumbling and then another soft appeal,

“Well, if it would be alright, I thought I might tag along and maybe stay in your backpack. You could talk to me on your breaks and then I would not have to be alone here with all the voices.....” I was not sure about that request. I was worried what might happen if Matilda got any ideas about my coworkers telling lies, and how they should be punished accordingly.

I was about to decline her request when I looked back up from my contemplation and saw her face had shifted to a design of hopeful anticipation. Her eyes were bright and shiny and her smile was wide and waiting. I relented and rather than deny her request, I decided to let her come along, just this once to my work. I was already forgetting that she had gotten a man killed just yesterday.

“Oh alright, just for today to see how it goes. But please be good.”

Matilda agreed readily and we were off to work.

It was a short drive to my work and I rode on with Matilda riding in my backpack, the back opened and her head poking out so she could see things as we drove. We arrived and I turned back to her and reminded her,

“Remember be good, okay?” I heard something odd that might have been a childlike grumble of acceptance and then a sweet and compliant answer of,

“Yes of course, thanks again for taking me with you. You are the best friend ever.”

We stepped inside and I went straight for my desk. I worked as an insurance underwriter for a small industrial insurance company. It paid well but like all insurance companies, the profit motive was king and as such, the company was not shy about any tactic to save a buck. The fear of losing our jobs kept a near constant aura of paranoia and suspicion in the office chatter. Chatter which I will admit I partook of from time to time, but often tried to avoid. It would be difficult to ignore any intrigue with a mind reading doll in my backpack, ready and eager to divulge my coworkers darkest secrets.

I walked straight past James and Kathy talking about something they had been doing on the week end and avoided direct eye contact with Bridget, who I knew would try and fill me in on the details of who she suspected was on Mr. Langdons shit list and who might be getting the axe next.

As I sat down and booted up my computer, I heard a familiar voice in my ear.

“Heya man, how was the weekend? Mine was great I met a new lady friend and let’s just say we hit it off big time, if you know what I mean.” It was Gary, a very friendly but slightly oversharing person. I sometimes spoke with him about random things, but often I tried to keep my head down at work even before a day like today.

I politely responded as I often did, with an attempt at what the business tried to discourage in sales calls, a close ended statement.

“Just fine thanks, glad yours was as well. Have to get to work, thanks Gary.” Gary shrugged and walked away and as he left, I heard a murmur in my mind. She was doing it again,

“Why would your friend pay someone for that?” I was confused and asked Matilda,

“For what? What do you mean?” There was a pause and Matilda spoke again,

“He paid his new friend he was speaking about, to do things with him and then she left and he paid her money. Is that what friends are supposed to do?” I sighed and realized that Matilda had seen Gary’s transaction with his new lady friend and I realized that their meeting was not quite as organic as Gary suggested. Matilda chimed in again and was about to go into more details when I cut her off.

“No thank you Matilda, I don’t need to know more about Gary’s prostitute.” Another delay and I sighed as I anticipated the next question,

“What is a prostitute? Is it a kind of friend.” I don’t know why but I responded in the same way a parent might to an awkward question from their kid by saying,

“I'll tell you when you are older. Let's leave it for now.” I heard an acknowledgement and I got back to work.

After an hour or so I looked up from my computer and saw the face of my boss Mr. Langdon leering down at me. He interrupted me by loudly clearing his throat and spoke,

“Did you get Kelso account reviewed yet?” He grinned down at me with barely disguised impatience and I looked at my log for the day and saw the name further down my list. I responded,

“Yeah, I will take care of it, why did they call? Did I need to expedite that one?” I should not have asked, since I saw the condescending look, he gave when someone asked a question he viewed as stupid. His face curled into a sarcastic smile and he said,

“Yes, expedite it pretty please with cherries on top. Not sure why I have to ask. You gotta be careful, clueless underwriters might be at risk. Gotta stay on top of it and be proactive.” He shot me one last annoying grin and walked away. I was upset by the indirect if not insulting exchange. Langdon was always a little passive aggressive, but today seemed like it was worse than usual. Then as if sensing my distress, I heard Matilda faintly in my mind and I knew she would not let the verbal slight go unanswered. I tried to tell her to stop but she was already away. I prayed she would not too anything too crazy.

After five minutes I felt her presence stirring again. I bent down and unzipped my backpack and I saw her face with a rictus of anger etched plainly on it. I was considering asking her what she did, but she spoke first,

“He is a bad man. He lies a lot. He lied to his family; he told them he did not know that woman. Then he hurt her and made her go away. He lies to his friends; he steals from them and hurts them too. He also lies to his employees. He is lying right now. He knows something he is not telling you or your friends here. He knows that the company is doing something called a “Merge” and that all of you will be laid off a month from now. He is the only person who will be moving on to the new company. He was not going to tell anyone until it was closer to the time and he would be forced to.”

My heart sank as I digested what Matilda had told me. That bastard knows we are all going to lose out jobs and he was going to string us all along with hardly any warning. I felt myself getting angry at the revelation and I immediately forgot what happened when Matilda knew something, or someone that made me angry or unhappy.

I had to get out of there, I was panicking at the prospect of losing my job and I did not know what might happen if Matilda recognized that and lashed out at what was making me upset. I stood up and started walking out. I ignored my coworkers questions at what was going on. Unfortunately, Mr. Langdon was near the door, having come back inside from an apparent phone call. He put his phone away and regarded me.

“Where's the fire? I thought I said expedite the Kelso account, not take a coffee break only an hour into your shift. You know it's this kind of attitude that...” I cut him off and got directly up in his face and told him,

“Why don’t you just fire me? Or were you waiting for another month to just make it easier and get rid of all of us at once?” His face turned white and he had no words to respond. The fear on his face validated the truth of what Matilda had said. He really did know and he was not going to tell any of us. He stuttered for some response but I brushed past him and tried to block the inevitable question the perforated my mind shortly afterwards,

“Can I make the bad man go away? He seems very heartless but I am sure there is a way I can find the truth, find his truth that makes him feel so bad that he just goes away....forever.” I found that my anger at the situation dulled the horror of Matilda’s threat more so than the last few times she offered to “Help”. I admit I almost made no effort to stop her, but I just managed a response of,

“No, it is not worth it. Don’t use his truth to make him go away. Thank you for the offer, Matilda. I just need to go home and start brushing up on my resume. I heard her acknowledgement and she said,

“I promise I won't make him do it.” I realize now, I should have been more specific.

When I got home, I collapsed on my couch. I knew that at some point I would need to get my computer and start looking for a new job. I did not have a lot of time left and I was not expecting to have to be looking so soon. Later that evening I was almost through processing my situation and trying to do something about it. Just then I got a call from an unknown number. I was shocked when I answered and I learned it was the police.

My jaw almost hit the floor when I learned that I was being contacted for a statement and witness testimony for a crime that occurred at my work. Apparently earlier that day there had been a homicide. The victim was of course my boss Mr. Langdon. The suspect, currently in custody and the reason for the call was to my shock, Gary. He had apparently gone berserk and had stabbed Mr. Langdon thirty two times with a letter opener. I could barely speak and I was encouraged to come down to the police station to give a proper account if I was not able to on the phone. They had wanted to know if any of his co workers had seen Gary acting strangely that morning or likely any other telling details that could help explain the violent and grizzly outburst.

After I was done with the call, I hung up and walked to the living room. I heard a soft melody humming in my head and I could tell Matilda was very happy. I walked up to her shelf and she had a broad smile on her face. I asked her directly,

“Why did you lie to me? Why did you kill Mr. Langdon!?” Matilda did not respond at first but the humming song had stopped. I felt an odd static in the air and I looked back as I heard a lightbulb explode in the kitchen. When I looked back there was an odd look on her face again. It looked half triumphant and half guilty. She spoke finally and said,

“But I didn't lie. I promised I wouldn't make him do it. I did not have him do it. I just showed the truth to all of your coworkers. Then after that, that man, Gary the one with the happy prostitute friend, he is the one who did something about it. So, like I said, I didn't lie. I never lie. That man was bad, he lied. Worse, he lied to my friend. I would never lie to my friend. I just want you to be happy.”

I couldn't believe it, the rationalization was hideous, but technically true. I had no idea what to do about her. I realized it was finally time to get some answers about where my “Friend” really came from. I resolved to go back to that antique store and see just what the hell Matilda was and where she came from.
