It's already been 2 weeks since i've got a job as a park ranger. It was an isolated area mean't to preserve possible near-extiction species,as they have no more than a dozens left alive .
I remember that when i first applied they made sure i went through enough training to prepare both physically and mentally,it was a very tough job according to my supervisor and would possibly include killing poachers if necessary. Of course i wasn't sure if it was acceptable to do that instead of arresting them but the site was pretty much far away from any possible city so i didn't complain and went along.
Everything seemed normal at the first days on my shifts,the same patrol around and make sure everything is being preserved and protected from poachers,you know,the usual park ranger duties,that is until the 11th day when i was called to do the night shift as the guard assigned to it got into a terrible accident on tbe way home and broke his leg,being someone who took the job seriously i agreed to it and stayed for the night shift,but before i could start,my supervisor went to me and explained what to do since it was different from my usual daytime shifts:

"Since it's your first time in this position,i can assume you're not used to this role right?" - He asked me as i geared up with the night shift tools.

"Yes sir,i'm not used to work until late,let alone on the dead of the night but i've got confidence that i can do it until the other guy recovers." - I answered,being a little nervous but keeping my stance.

He pulled me aside before i was about to start and explained me what i had to do and what to expect in certain situations:
"Alright so here are the basics,if you hear bone cracking sounds,ignore them. If you hear metal rustling,turn off your flashlight,  and if you hear voices calling for you that aren't coming from your radio,shoot your gun to scare them away. Do i need to repeat anything?" - He asked in a serious way.

"N-no sir,i understood everything,if you want i can even get a note if i forget." - I answered,a bit nervous after his explanation.

"Good,i'll be reaching you to time from time to check." - And as he said that he walked away.

Now alone and fully geared i started the patrol,i was supposed to head to the north zone of the site and make sure everything is in order. The moon was shining bright and everything was quiet and eerie,not even owls could be heard,everything was dead silent save for my footsteps and the voice on the radio from my supervisor.
As i was already midway on the path i started to hear the metal rustling nearby so as instructed i turned off my flashlight and waited,it was obviously too dark to see but i could make a silhouette that somewhat resembled a wolf with something on it's back but it quickly ran off,and i turned on my flashlight again to keep moving. I was approaching the location i heard the same voices i was told about,my supervisor who also could hear it from his radio instructed me to fire my gun,but as i was about to do it i  realized i didnt load any bullet and i noticed the voices getting closer but they started to fade away on the darkness,it was tempting so despite my supervisor telling me to proceed i went off the path and followed the voices,that's when i found the source.
It looked vaguely human,but it's skin was so melted that it looked like clay,it was hard to hear but i could make some words it was trying to scream:

"Help...please h-help...i beg you..." - It hopelessly tried to say.

I just stood there frozen and when i turned my flashlight up i noticed the wolf thing,it was huge,5'5 in height if i had to guess,it had metal tendrils coming out of it's back and it just stared as it pulled the melted body humanoid as it continued to beg for help. Without any choice i ran back to the path and kept going until i reached my destiny and found my supervisor waiting for me,he pulled me inside the radio building and quickly shut the door.

"So,what did you find on the way?" - He asked while panting from shutting the door.

"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?!I COULD'VE DIED BECAUSE OF THAT THING!WAS IT  ALWAYS HERE ON THE SITE?!" - I yelled while trying to get answers.

He just shut me off and explained everything to me. This place had more dangerous species that were largely hunted across the globe so they were brought here to be kept. I was still confused about the situation,why would they want them alive?are they really that important?
The next days in the night shift were much more quieter but from time to time i would see the wolf thing or another weird animal that i couldn't make the details,i'm not sure what this place really is or what are all the things living within the area but i know one thing,those monsters were better off contained.
