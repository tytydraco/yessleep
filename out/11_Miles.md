I never thought I would actually find it.  Every night, I drove through the forest on my way home, and every night, I watched the trees for anything unusual.  Anything abnormal.  

I saw the trees before I saw the road.  They hung low, as if their leaves were heavier than expected.  They looked wrong, as if faintly lit up by the setting sun, even though it was nighttime.

I pulled to a stop at the opening to the road, chills sinking into the deepest parts of my body.  It was real.  A treelined road that led to what I knew was just someone's farm.  

I didn't hesitate.  Why would I?  I'd just filled up on gas, I wasn't the slight bit tired, and this was my one chance to have the thing that I wanted most.

I always planned to do this in my equinox, but my van would have to work.  She'd been there for me my entire life, and we would have to go into this together.   She was a large, heavy, high-top-roof conversion van, built in the late 80s.

She had blue and white striped paint, a frankly pathetic sound system, and four glass headlights that shone into the gloom.   I nervously reached up, patting the dashboard.   "We got this..." I whispered softly, glancing up to my dashcam.   Unsurprisingly, the device was had already turned itself off.  Figures.

I knew my phone would be of no help, so I turned it off, and placed it in the box between the seats where the playstation rested.  I didn't want the radio interfering either, so I disconnected the faceplate and set it in the cupholder.

I let go of the brake, and a tired old V8 rumbled as I turned down onto the 11-mile road.

Mile one was easy.  As the white dial on the odometer hit "5", I realized that it was getting cold.  Well, colder than usual.  The AC in my van was expensive to keep working, but somehow it did.  For now though, I shut it off.  The sky above the trees was crystal clear, even though the weather had been calling for storms on my way home.  It was beautiful.  

There were more stars than I had ever seen before in my life, which were distracting enough that I almost didn't think to turn the heat on.  I set the van to heat, since only on "heat" would coolant flow to the rear unit.  By the time I reached the second mile, the van had started to warm back up again.  

The odometer ticked over to 1, and as I entered the third mile, just as expected, I began to see figures amongst the trees.  Shadows, vaguely shaped like humans, but not quite right.   The neck might be too long, or the head too wide.  

I tried not to look at them, and as I reached mile four, I tried not to listen to them, either.  The figures filled the space between the trees now, clogging up the forest, whispering faintly to me in the very back of my mind.  

The road was getting worse now.  Sharp bend after sharp bend, potholes and fallen logs...  nothing that stopped me completely, but navigating an old van around these things wasn't exactly easy.  Still, it helped having a truck-like frame, since certain things I could simply drive right over.  

Suddenly, to the left, the treeline abruptly ended, revealing a huge lake beside the road.  The moon hung heavy over the neverending waters, shining so brightly that my headlights didn't seem to be doing much of anything.  It was what Moonlight would look like if it was as bright as the sunlight.

I only looked at the Moon for a monent, and even then, when I looked back to the road, my van had already started to veer towards the side of the road.   I gripped the wheel tightly, and as the odometer approached another 9, I saw the trees rushing back up to greet me on the left.  

It was like driving into a tunnel.  One moment, I could see everything as if it was midday in august, and the next, nothing.  I shuddered slightly, taking solace that my pilgrimage was halfway over.  

My van had six lights up front.  Two high beams, two low beams, and two cheap little LED lights on the grille, aimed towards the sides of the road so I could spot Deer more effectively.  I knew my wiring was good, but I forgot what else Mile six entailed, and I flinched slightly as the radio beeped.  

I'd turned it down all the way, but I could still faintly hear the calm voice as it spoke.  I grit my teeth, as I knew what it meant.  It would speak of my fears, the horrors that haunted me, and ironically, that which sent me on this trip in the first place.

So I did what most others did on mile six, I sped up.   I moved the shifter, taking away third gear from the transmission, since the engine roared louder in 2nd.  Driving the van actually helped a little here, because it took so much effort to keep the damn thing on the road, I barely registered anything the voice had been saying.  

Thankfully, the voice began fading, and I hazarded a glance to the odometer to see that I was nearly to the seventh mile.  The only issue was, on mile seven, the radio was simply exchanged for screams outside.  

The shadows were back, but these ones screamed and cried with pain and agony.  The further along I got, the louder the screams sounded, until one of them screeched directly into my ear, as if it was behind me!  I flinched, but I stubbornly glared out the windshield, trying desperately not to pay any attention to the faint, haggard wheezing behind me- breaths from something that hadn't needed lungs in a very long time.

As I hit the 8th mile, the breathing behind me went silent.   I stepped on the brakes, shivering as the road twisted and turned back on itself.  I downshifted again, locking the transmission into 1st gear.  Partially for the nose, partially for power, and partially to generate as much heat as possible.  

The cold was unbearable here, and both the front and rear heaters were struggling to warm the air at all.  My headlights grew even more unreliable, flickering and giving out at random.  Usually I would have at least some lights, but sometimes, they would all go out, and I'd have to slow down until they came back.

The screaming was all outside the van now.  I could hear fingers dragging on the paint, on the glass, but I ignored all of it.  There was no turning back now.  

As the odometer slowly rolled, halfway between "9" and "0", the engine cut out.  The headlights flickered off, the cabin fans died, and the resulting abscence of sound was flooded with the screams and cries from outside.  

I closed my eyes tightly.   I could hear them, pulling on the door handles, banging on the glass, shaking the vehicle slightly.  I turned the key back, shifted into neutral, and cranked the engine over.  

It turned, weakly, as if the cold was already sapping every last shred of strength from the battery.  I began to shake as I turned the key again, my jar clenched tightly, and right as the engine  seemed to make its last revolution, one, then two, then four of the cylinders fired, spinning the engine over just enough for the rest to wake up and bring it to life.  

I dragged the shifter back to "1" as I floored the gas pedal, and as soon as the transmission shifted, the van lurched forwards.  For perhaps the first time ever, I was thankful that I lacked the necessary engine power to spin the wheels.

I opened my eyes again after a moment, resuming my mission of steering even as I raced for the tenth mile.  The road turned right, left, right again, right even more, impossibly, as if I was driving through an area I had just been, until it suddenly opened up.  

Well, it didn't open up, but the road straightened.  I couldn't hear the voices anymore, and while the treelines were still filled with ghostly figures, they didn't whisper, or scream.  They simply watched.  They knew what was ahead, and they knew I likely wouldn't suvive it.  

But I didn't care.  The road straightened out again, but as I pushed the gas pedal somewhat, the engine died a second time.   The lights went out, along with everything else in the vehicle.   Even the LED on the old trailer brake controller went out.

The forest looked like a tunnel now, with no light except for a faint redness in the distance.  The van kept rolling forwards, moving on its own now.  Dragged towards the redness.  I slid the lever to AC, for some reason, as if that would help, but that was all I had the time to do before I had to close my eyes tightly, cover them with both hands, and brace myself.

The 11th mile of the road was hell.  From every possible angle, unfathomable noise shook me to the bone, my muscles all tensing as a response.  The freezing cold was replaced with moments by excessive heat.  For a few moments it felt like the time my AC conked out in the middle of august, but I was soon wishing it was that cold as it increased.  

I could only imagine what was happening to my van outside- the headlights melting and pouring molten glass down over the bumper, the paint stripping, the fiberglass roof lighting on fire.   I could feel my skin burning, melting off of my bones, my entire body burnt away just like my van, as if we had tumbled into the depths of hell and plunged into the deepest magma of the earth's very core-

And then it was over.  I heard the engine ignite, then hum with power.  I heard the AC compressor kick on, and I felt cool air tumble from the vents.   The screaming and noise was already fading into my memories, and I shuddered as I slowly took hold of the steering wheel again.  

It was almost over.  I gently pressed the brake pedal, and the van rolled to a stop.   I took a moment to breathe, still shivering a little as memories of the ordeal passed through me.  I touched one of my arms with the other, just to make sure I was still real.  For now.

I almost, almost glanced at the rearview mirror.  But I didn't.  I let go of the brake, looked ahead, and started driving.  After less than a mile, maybe a kilometer or so, I came around a curve, and to a dead end.  The road simply stopped.  Trees beyond it, trees to either side.  I had done it.

I closed my eyes, and I laid back in my seat.  I thought about what I had wanted so very badly to put myself through this ordeal.  Something I knew science or witchcraft could never give me.  Something I couldn't afford to fake like so many others.

I didn't realize I had started to fall asleep until I awoke with a start, jolting enough to rock the van slightly.  I was back where I started.  Back at the entrance to the 11-mile road.   Behind me was the town I'd gotten gas in, and ahead of me was home.  

I looked down.  Looked at the fur that now lined my arms.   I leaned forwards in my seat, enough to let my leathery wings open and curl around me from either side.  Now smiling, I finally looked up in the mirror, admiring my horns, and the razor-sharp teeth lining my smile.  

I was everything I had ever wanted to be.
