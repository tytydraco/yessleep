I was going camping in the forest, as I used to do every year. I have always enjoyed spending time in nature, away from the hustle and bustle of the city. This time, I decided to explore a different area, a little further from my usual campsite. That was when I saw that someone had made a trail, as the vegetation was disturbed, and this strange path extended all the way to the entrance of a cave. I can't explain what caught my attention, maybe it was the sense of mystery emanating from that place. The cave seemed dark and scary, but at the same time, it seemed to invite me to explore it.

I found a notebook in an old and dusty backpack that was lying at the entrance. The backpack seemed to have been dragged and torn. There were bloodstains on the cover of the notebook and on some pages. As soon as I opened it, I noticed something strange. The handwriting started off normal, like someone who writes without hurry, sitting at a desk. It continued like that until the note "day 2". From the note "day 3" onwards, the handwriting became a little shaky. I thought it might be the cold, but the shaky handwriting was so intense that it seemed like the person who wrote it was trembling with fear or in a hurry. The contents of the pages left me chilled and with an inexplicable fear.

"Day 1…. I arrived at the forest this morning. I set up my tent near a stream and made a fire to keep warm. At night, I heard some strange noises, as if something was dragging on the ground. I thought it could be some animal, so I ignored it and tried to sleep.

Day 2…. I woke up with the feeling that something was watching me. There was nothing nearby, but I still felt a chill down my spine. During the day, I walked through the forest and noticed that I was being followed. I couldn't see who or what it was, but I felt its presence. At night, I heard those strange noises again and started to get worried.

Day 3…. A dark and mysterious thing has been following me in the forest and getting closer and closer. It's almost like I can feel its breath on my neck and hear its heavy footsteps. It seems to know every corner of the forest better than I do. This night, the creature approached even closer and I could only see a dark shadow moving between the trees. Its glowing eyes were the only thing I could distinguish in the darkness.

Day 4…. I'm starting to feel like I won't be able to escape. It's getting closer and closer. I know it's taunting me and enjoying seeing me suffer. I couldn't sleep tonight because the creature was outside, howling and scratching at my tent.

Day 5…. I can't take this anymore. The creature was talking to me, whispering things in my mind. It was telling me horrible things, things that I can't repeat here. I tried to run, but it always found me. Today, it revealed itself completely. When I looked at it, I couldn't believe what I saw. Its appearance was grotesque and it seemed to have something sharp in its hands. It approached while insisting on whispering things in my mind. I felt a chill run through my entire body. Am I losing my sanity?

I started running, but I knew it was following me. I entered a cave and the journey through it seemed endless. I heard the creature getting closer and closer and started to panic. The cave has no way out, or maybe I got lost in its tunnels. I think this is the end, I'm surrounded and I can already see its glowing eyes coming in the distance. I'm leaving my notebook here in a hole I found in the cave wall, hoping that someone finds it and knows not to stay here. If anyone finds this notebook, please don't come after me. I don't want anyone to suffer what I'm suffering."

I took a deep breath and tried to calm myself down. It was just a story, a work of fiction. There was nothing to be afraid of. The notebook ended there. The shaky and bloodstained handwriting left me with a feeling of fear and anguish. I knew I shouldn't investigate, but my curiosity got the best of me. Slowly, I made my way towards the entrance of the cave. I looked around, but it was too dark to see anything. I took out my phone and turned on the flashlight. I took a few steps towards the darkness and tried to illuminate. Where the light could barely reach, I noticed that there was blood everywhere, and the walls were covered in scratches. I saw something move out of the corner of my eye and quickly turned around. It was just a bat, but it still scared me. I was about to leave when I heard a voice.

I turned around, but there was no one there. The voice seemed to be coming from inside my head. I tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. My body shuddered and I felt that someone or something was watching me. Fear froze me and I couldn't move. The forest was darker and colder, I hadn't noticed that night had already arrived. I tried to move my eyes, and that's when I noticed…. two shining points…. in the darkness
