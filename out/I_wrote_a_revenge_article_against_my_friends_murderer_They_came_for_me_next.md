What is an appropriate reaction to grief? The only thing I wanted when it happened was for the responsible to pay for their actions. A raging fire burnt me from the inside day in and day out, and I wished for that same fire to stir up everyone in our small world, because I believe in the power of unity, especially if we have to put an end to evil.

May 1968. The first case of what would much later be known as the dice murders was reported. A man has been found in his own house burnt to death with acid. Signs of struggles were evident even though there were no indication of forced entry in the premises. Carefully placed next to the body, was a white dice on which the face with two dots was painted in black. February 1971. The second case was reported in another town. A woman was found in her office as she was working late, electrocuted to death, but the source could not be identified. Next to the body, there was a white dice on which the face with three dots was painted in black. September 1977. The third case, similar to the first one, with an unidentified victim burnt with acid and a white dice with the two dots face painted in black. November 1985. The fourth case with a young victim found with not a single drop of blood remaining in the body. A white dice with the five dots face painted in black was found next to the body. March 1986. The firth case with an old man found dead in his bed, with his skin turned green and covered with ulcers as a putrid smell emanated from the body. A white dice with the one dot face painted in black was found next to the victim. April 1990. My friend and fellow journalist was given the same treatment as the fourth victim from November 1985. Since, I literally freeze or spiral out of control at the mere sight of a dice or any big representation of the number 5 like on a price tag or a sport jersey for example. My employer and colleagues knew about the negative effects that loss had on me, yet, maybe in compassion and to help me cope, they let me write the article that made me the next target.

October 1995 at 11:34pm. After loathing the entire year because of the number 5, I was anticipating the next one with a lot of hope because of the progress made in science. I had a feeling that everything would be in place for the responsible of those murders to finally be brought to justice. Before going home, I was just finishing reviewing a few articles written by the new recruits when suddenly...

"Good evening Regina." A male, smooth and soothing voice resounded from my right. I jumped in surprise, and left my chair immediately when I saw that my couch was then occupied by 3 people while a few others stood all around.

They were six in total, all dressed in black with coats that had numbers written in white on the left side of the chest, going from 1 to 6. They all looked pale and otherworldly, giving the feeling that they were from another era but just found themselves at the wrong place and the wrong time. However, I was the one in a very dire situation.

"Who— who are you? How did you—" I attempted speaking, outnumbered and overwhelmed by fear. 

"You can call me One." The owner of the soothing voice spoke again. Of course, he wore the coat with the number 1 on the chest. He was tall, lanky and looked sick and frail. "And as you can probably see for yourself, this is Two, Three, Four, Five and Six. We prefer to be referred as the Dice Family, instead of the Dice Killer like you always do in your articles." One said, introducing them all.

"Wh— what?" That was the only thing I could muster, dominated by their fearful presence.

"Regina I'm afraid that we have matters to settle after the horrendous article you wrote about us. We usually do not go for the personal angle, but immediate action is required in this case to restore the family's honor." One spoke, pulling a dice from his pocket.

"All that rage and hate in each and every word in your article. Because of what? Your friend?" Two spoke, with her female and calm voice that was reminiscent of a loving mother tender voice and tone.

"Please understand her Two, I would be equally angry if I were her. Who wouldn't want to keep such meal for oneself? Your friend tasted utterly delicious, exquisite." Five spoke, her mocking and taunting smile revealing sharp white teeth.

"Enough of the pleasantries! Please One, roll the dice, I have a feeling that tonight is my turn. Finally, finally my greatness will be revealed once again." Said Six, who apparently was the youngest, and with his eyes beaming with excitement.

As soon as One threw the dice in the air, I screamed and ran to the door. Three rapidly stood in the way with an unbelievable speed. I froze then looked at One catching the dice, before opening his hand and announcing the number like the lucky winner of some very sick game.

"Number 3."One calmly said.

"What? No, no this can't be!" Six protested. "This dice has to be faulty! I demand justice! Let me roll the dice!" He added. 

"Please have some decorum and tact Six!" Three retorted, speaking for the first time. "Four here is in the same situation in case your memory is faulty." He added.

"Nonsense! This one is the 544th, why am I shunned so often?" Six asked.

"Maybe because you don't leave much behind." Five replied.

"Enough! Please make it fast! We've been here for far too long." One said.

"I have to tell you the shocking truth, Regina. It will hurt." Three revealed, extending his strong and muscular arms in my direction. 

The moment he touched me, I was paralysed and then became stiff. I then started convulsing as a deadly amount of volts made its way through my entire body until I lost consciousness.

I woke up several days later in a hospital bed. There is no indication on how I survived. According to the medical staff, I have just been revived in time after being found unconscious. When I mentioned the six killers, nobody believed that they were present in the building. The reasons are that it is very difficult for a group of 6 people to move so discreetly and also, I was accused of being so obsessed with the dice murders to the point of staging an encounter with the responsible. A white dice with the three dots face painted in black was found next to me and I know that I did not manufacture it myself. The authorities let me keep it since they believed that it is fake. I lost any credibility as a journalist along with the career I had worked for. Maybe, this is what Three meant when he said that it will hurt. Everyday, every single day since that time, I think about my end, while the murders, even though covered up, continue to occur.
