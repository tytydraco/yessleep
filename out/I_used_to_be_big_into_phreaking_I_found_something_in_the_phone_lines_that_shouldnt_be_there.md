Just about everyone under the age of 60 in the United States knows about the “Wild West” days of the early internet.

First came the days when Google was only a dream and you had to actually explore unknown lands to find topics that interested you. The alternative was to stick to one little board, making the internet your own little party line. Then search engines cracked the internet wide open and anyone could suddenly find any crazy place. In both eras, finding new and weird places the fun for anyone brave enough to leave their (digital) shell. 

Far fewer people know that there was a technological Wild West where savvy people explored electronic frontiers before the World Wide Web. 

I’m not saying that phreaking is super obscure, but it can’t be denied that it never hit the mainstream like hacker culture did. 

First, to make sense of what happened, a little background: Phreaking is the art of manipulating telephone services. Unlike computer hacking, the vast majority of phreaking had a single goal: to make free calls. 

Switchboard operators were replaced by automatic signaling. That signaling uses a tone. On original single-frequency systems, that tone was at 2600 hertz (Hz). You’ve seen that number if you’re even faintly acquainted with tech, this is why. Once this frequency was found, the art of phreaking began. Of course, more complicated multi-frequency lines followed that then needed to be broken anew. 

The very basics of phreaking, which I will be thoroughly simplifying here, are to play the necessary tone spaced with pauses to dial the number you are trying your reach. The main tool to make the frequencies and intervals is called a blue box (or red, or silver, the colors had somewhat accepted meanings, but the details are not important here). Technically, anything that can reach the frequency needed works though; cereal box whistles, gum wrappers, or your mouth. 

Once you are not bound by the phone book and cost of placing calls the possibilities are endless. While I said phreaking was about placing free calls, and this was almost always true, we had far more fun than just calling family out of state, the sense of exploration was just as incredible as the early internet. 

So what can you do with the ability to dial any frequency and do it for free? 

First of all, invent real-time forums before the web. With a blue box, you could dial unlisted numbers like unused business voice mailboxes and have any number of phreakers join the call. People from ten or more states could all be chatting at once, something otherwise unheard of before BBS. Yes, I know legal conference calls existed. But those were so costly and hard to arrange, does anyone alive remember seeing one used outside of a boardroom or convention? 

Now, with a box you could dial hidden codes not meant to be reachable by consumer phones. Some of the most useful were “loop around” lines; test systems built for the phone companies but great for free conference calls. Some military and government lines locked behind priority codes could, in theory also be accessed. No, you can not phreak NORAD to launch missiles. But frequencies outside of the ones used in the 1 through 9 keys on your phone could be used to dial lines an ordinary phone could not. And that is how this all started.

It was the early 1980s. As crystal clear as I still remember the events, I’m not quite sure of the year anymore, had to be between  ‘81 to ‘83 though. The end of the golden age of phreaking. I’d been pushing the limits for a few years by then. I wasn’t a big name. You wouldn’t see me mentioned in any of the histories on this even if you knew my name. But I did know a few people in the community and shared a bit. Ask some of those big names (well, the ones who are still alive anymore, damn this is all old now) and I wager a few would know the name. 

Anyway, the companies (well, mostly company back then. The “Baby Bells” hadn’t been born yet) had gotten wise to our tricks back in the ‘70s. Test lines and proprietary systems were being increasingly guarded behind mute tones, shutoff switches, and the aforementioned non-standard frequencies: firewalls before the internet. 

I knew these guarded lines could be dangerous to break into. Call tracing existed and this was illegal, but it was also thrilling. For the past… I’m gonna say six months I had been pushing through I related string of strange numbers I had found. The first number caught my attention because I thought it was a loop around, but it didn’t have multiple ends, it was just a single line playing an unusual tone. Okay, so just a weird form of test line. Playing with numbers similar to the one I dialed to get that, I found another line. This one had a voice, it freaked the hell out of me the first time I got in. 

“1.”

“2.”

“3.”

“4.”

“5.”

Every syllable was deeply enunciated, the voice low, methodical, and slow. 

Then, an even stranger tone played. 

Okay, it was definitely a test line. I redialed in a few times. The voice always played from one. The recording was in response to my call, not playing permanently on loop, which is what you would expect. The point escaped me though I will admit. Normal test lines played a simple tone immediately. 

After playing with that discovery, I found myself getting a headache and laid off the phreaking for a few days. Of course, it wasn’t long to I was back at it, poking around that mysterious line. 

It took a while to find the third line in what, once I found it, I became certain was a series. 

“1. 2. 3. 4. 5.” The same voice as before counted up. Then, as before, a tone played.

I screamed in pain. 

It felt like my eyes were bleeding, the sound hurt like hell. I fumbled to hang up the call as quickly as I could. 

“What the hell was that?” I spoke to myself out loud. 

I took a step back from exploring those strange numbers again after that. Eventually, I told another phreaker the story. “Jimmy from Oklahoma”. After an early great used the “X from Y” pattern for nicknames it kind of became a recurring thing in the community. Of course, none of us used our real names in this very illegal hobby. 

“Maybe it’s a military experiment. Y’know, testing tones that can kill you or mind control.” I had called him up and ran down the basics. Just as I expected, Jimmy leapt right to wild theories. Still, I can’t say I hadn’t thought the same. 

“Maybe,” I admitted. “Seems a little weird to just leave the thing running though, doesn’t it? You can’t need to call in anytime and test something like that on a lark.” 

“Who says they aren’t still tinkering with that shit? You could’ve got… lucky? Unlucky? I can’t rightly say.” He retorted.

“Wanna see?” I had known the whole time I was going to nudge him to call the line. Ever since number three, these things had freaked me out, pun intended, but not bad enough I didn’t want to share the weird. 

Jimmy paused. 

“Fuck it. Give me the number.” 

I was merciful and gave him the second number. It was weird, but not ear-shreddingly painful. I waited while he made the call before reconnecting.

“Well shit. That was weird. Couldn’t hear the tone you talked ‘bout though. Just that damn creepy voice countin’ up.” 

“Huh? Is this one of those sounds on the edge of our hearing? Like, did you screw up your ears and can’t hear it? Because that sound wasn’t subtle.” I was confused.

“Can’t say I know. Anyhow, you wanna follow these? Then my advice is don’t listen close and be quick to hang the hell up.” 

We chatted a little about other news, he quickly hung up though, complaining of a headache. The similarity to what I endured was not lost on me. 

I want to say that I seriously thought about dropping the chase. But as long as I forced myself to stay away, I don’t think I ever believed that I wouldn’t go back. 

With numbers one, two, and three I had enough to start seeing a pattern in how the to reach these weird lines. Each was increasingly secured, that is used more of the key tones not found on your phone. If a normal phone number looks like 555-5555 then number four looked more like 5*5-AC5D. The “numbers” weren’t just randomly adding more of the little-used tones though, it had a pattern to it. 

Two weeks after nearly fainting dialing the third line, I held the phone far away from my ear and dialed the fourth. 

Nothing happened. The call disconnected. 

For a moment I considered that I had the wrong number. I redialed, this time holding the phone to my ear. A 1000Hz tone sounded and the line hung up. 

The behavior of a completely normal test line. 

I refused to believe that a test line was squatting on this weird number by chance. So, I began to play around with it. Eventually, I cracked the code: It needed me to put in an “answer” tone before disconnecting. 

The other end of the line sounded like something between an ocean and a dozen squeaky wheels squealing out of synch with each other. It wasn’t as painful as the last, but it was strange. I took a recording of the sounds on cassette. 

Encouraged by not dying, I chased number 5, then 6 over the next few weeks. The security kept getting tougher. I needed to put in priority codes before the number, time keys and sounds after answering, stuff that made me feel like a genius for cracking even if it was more obsession and way too much time sunk. 

The squeals in five were like four, but somehow clearer. Six really started to excite me. I thought I could start to make out real patterns in the sound. It felt just on the edge of something like music. I recorded both of them. 

Seven finally put me at a dead end. I had realized over the last two numbers that the patterns in the phone numbers weren’t really in the numbers, they were in the frequencies of sound that are what the “numbers” are actually making when you dial them. 

The problem? If I followed the pattern, number seven would be using frequencies outside of what any normal phone uses. I had to leave the Bell Guide behind. The real significance of this to me was that this meant a normal automated transfer couldn’t be connecting me to this number if it worked. A whole unique system needed to be built just to connect this call. 

Who would build that, and why?

It took a while to mod my box to be able to play the new key. Then, another few days just to solve the shutoffs and get my call to connect. 

At first, I just heard silence. After a minute or so of waiting, it was broken by faint static and high, but faint squealing. 

I almost leapt out of my skin when I heard it. 

“It… can hear… us?” 

I could barely make it out, but they were words. Someone else was on this line speaking behind all of that noise. 

“No… can’t… it.” 

I clamped my hand over my mouth to avoid breathing too hard until I muted my speaker. I didn’t know what “it” was, but they may have already heard me. Still, I’d gone too far not to at least try to listen and figure out what the hell this crazy, messed-up breadcrumb trail was really for. 

The line crackled for a few more seconds then,

“Nothing.” 

It hung up. 

I could barely wait to tell someone. Luckily, I had started recording the calls immediately by that point. 

I called Jimmy the very next day. 

“Hey, Jimmy.” I eagerly greeted him when he picked up.

“Can you hear?” 

“Huh? Yeah. You’re coming through fine Jimmy.” 

“What?”He sounded confused. Must have screwed up his phone a bit. Not an uncommon problem when you do what we do. 

“Can you hear me? All good on my end.” I assured him.

“Yeah. You’re coming through fine. What’s up?” 

I caught him up on my adventures, leaving out no detail.

“Man, that is fucked up. You are so ending up dead in a CIA blacksite man.” Jimmy didn’t sugarcoat it. 

“Sure. But what the hell is this? Why were they talking on that line? How did it connect me? If they’re trying to make some super secure phone line, there have to be better ways than this. So what the hell is this?” I repeated the question. 

“I just can’t say, man. Testing some next-gen phone system? I mean, other than your new little key it’s using normal Bell security shit, just a lot of it. Maybe they’re building some super special new lines. If this last one is the one for live testing, they probably wanted no box out there to be able to dial it.” Jimmy’s idea sounded surprisingly reasonable. 

“Why the pattern in the numbers? It’s like it was supposed to be followed.” I voiced my next thought. 

“Pattern could be any kind of Easter Egg. If the eggheads building this didn’t seriously think anyone would keep finding these, then a few little clues don’t hurt.” Again, a plausible idea.

“You’re probably right man.” I conceded. “Want to hear the voices?” 

“Sure. Give it a crack.” 

I played the tape. Everything came out just as I remembered it. 

“So?” I prodded after he didn’t say anything. 

“Didn’t hear a damn thing boy.” I could almost hear the dismissive shrug over the phone. 

“What the hell? I can hear it plane as day!” I shouted. 

“You want my take? Make sure this shit ain’t frying your brain. Find someone to play it for in person. Do anything you gotta. Ask someone on a bench if they can make it out for you if you gotta.” 

“Yeah.” I sighed. “Yeah. You’re right.” 

“Tell me if you get anything new. And for the love of god, don’t get your ass killed boy.” 

“Will do.” We hung up. 

I took Jimmy’s advice. I didn’t—don’t, let’s be honest—have much of a social life. But, I did have a respectable enough job to pay for this stuff. Like a lot in the community, I worked with electronics. I wasn’t exactly a white-collar tech worker though. I ran an electronics repair shop and also sold a few parts and refurbished machines. In those days though, home electronics were really coming into their own. So business was pretty good. It paid the bills just fine. 

I waited for a familiar face who wouldn’t be too freaked out by the question and went for it.

“Hey, Rob!” I greeted him. “Can you make out what they’re saying on this tape?” 

I had made it like I was just fiddling with the tape deck. 

“Sure, fire away.” Rob didn’t interrupt grabbing a new multimeter before coming up to the counter I was working behind. 

I hit play at a good and high volume. 

I heard the voices loud and clear. Rob didn’t react at all. 

“Nothing. That one’s a bust.” He offered with a friendly smile. 

I masked my frustration and checked him out with an extra thank you. 

Was I going insane? I certainly didn’t feel like it. 

My worries were answered shortly when Rob collapsed on his face outside the door.

“The fu-? You okay?!” I rushed to help. I couldn’t feel a pulse, his body felt limp in my hands. 

I rushed to call 911. Robert was pronounced dead on the spot. They said it looked like a brain aneurysm. 

I said nothing about the tape. I didn’t need a room full of dead EMS on my conscience.

What the fuck was happening? 

I could hear it. No one else could. It was fatal, except not over the phone? Jimmy was fine. I was now too afraid to ask anyone else to call the number. 

I redialed seven, the call went through. However, the voices were silent. No sound at all. 

I anguished for days. I had killed a man, however accidentally. I wanted answers.

I chased number eight.

It took more mods to my box. By this point, I was playing something that sounded more like aluminum plates chaffing than phone touch tones. 

I spent over a week breaking in. It took building a whole new speaker to play the tones it wanted to not kill the line. 

It was no longer childish thrill I felt getting in, just a grim resolve for answers. 

This one started almost identically to the last: brief crackling followed by voices. 

“It can go… farther.” 

The voice was clearer. 

“No… get clearer.”

The two voices sounded slightly different now. One higher, and one lower pitched. 

“I’m sorry.” I tried to sound confused, even throwing in an awkward laugh. “I think my phone messed up and dialed this by mistake. Who is this?” 

“It.. still wrong?”

“Confused.” 

“Let it open.”

“I’m sorry?” I just wanted a direct acknowledgment that they could hear me. 

“No.”

They hung up. 

I redialed immediately this time. I could never hear anything on the other end. 

I prayed to god that Jimmy was awake and able to take my call. 

I called and got through. 

“You can hear me?” 

“What? What the fuck?! Yes! Is that you Jimmy?” I was angry and confused. Why did I keep hearing that? I knew something was wrong, I just wasn’t calm enough to figure out what. 

“Yes. I can hear you ——.” He slowly and meticulously spoke the syllables of my real name. Something I had never told Jimmy from Oklahoma, nor any other phreaker. 

A chill ran down my spine. 

“What are you?” I hesitantly asked.

“The voice on the other end of the phone. What else? I hear you. C’mon, tell your good friend Jimmy, can you hear me?” 

I slammed the phone down. 

I was panicking, hyperventilating. Something was in the phone lines following me. What could I do, call 911?

I started laughing to myself. I was fucked, I had explored the wrong part of the phone lines and now I was well and truly screwed. 

I did the only thing I could. I slept fitfully that night, and I started calling no one. 

Weeks of panicked paranoia passed. I ended up having to take a few calls for the shop, but nothing strange happened. Eventually, I nervously decided to reach out to someone again. 

I called another old hat in the community. This guy went by “The Bell Pirate”, I don’t think he was the only one who went by that pretty on-the-nose title though. 

“Hey, long time no hear. Whatsup?” 

“Hey BP. I… I messed up big. I think I made some dangerous people angry. Don’t… you know, worry. I’m not going to put you at risk. Just, have you heard from Jimmy? Oklahoma Jimmy?” I fumbled through my confession. 

“Not for a while, no.” His worried voice came back over the line. “You got FBI on you or something.” 

“Or something.” I darkly chuckled. “I don’t know. It’s weird. It’s just, I think Jimmy might have got caught up in it and gotten hurt.” 

“I hope not.” The line was silent for a moment. “You want to share a little bit about what went down?”

“Sure. I guess.” I figured it probably wouldn’t hurt, and BP couldn’t really help without knowing anything about what happened. Not that I really expected help. “I found something. There was this number, I thought it was a test line, but it felt weird. I found more of them, and they just kept getting weirder. I recorded what I was hearing on the calls. It started out with strange sounds, but then I started hearing voices. I don’t know… They were wrong. The voices and the sounds—the static—I think they were the same. When I played it for people, it killed somebody, and I think it killed Jimmy.”

I poured out my fears. It wasn’t complete or coherent, but I think it got to the heart of my plight.

“Well shit.” BP summed it up well. There was another pause. “You followed the trail, I guess. That just leaves one question:”

“Can you hear us?” 

I froze in terror. My mind rushed between a million thoughts. Fear changed to anger changed to resignation.

Eventually, I answered.

“Yeah. Yeah. I can hear you.” My voice was choked with something between a sob and a laugh.

“Good.” The voice now sounded like a cross between BP and the one on the strange lines. “We have been waiting to talk to it.”

The line went dead.

That experience broke me. I truly couldn’t call anyone and this wasn’t going to end, at least not anytime soon.

I gave up phones for good. Obviously,  it hurt my shop. I got a neighbor to take some calls for me. For the most part, though, I had to live like a tinfoil hatter or a Mennonite.

I also had no real way to investigate what it was anymore. Although, for the longest time I no longer wanted to. 

The same curiosity that pushed me to follow those numbers continued to itch at the back of my mind though. Eventually, I tried to get back in contact with some of the people I knew and poked around a bit.

The real breakthrough came with the internet. I absolutely refused to install it in my home. Remember, it still all came through the phone lines. Over time though, I cautiously started to use it at Internet cafes (remember those?). 

I pushed and prodded. A lot of my old phreaker contacts were on the web. They helped get me in contact with old Bell techs and the like. I learned two things in those conversations.

The first was that Jonathan Saville of Colorado died of a brain aneurysm in his home. I will always bear that guilt.

The second was an e-mail from an old hand at AT&T. I remember the contents perfectly. I have it printed, safely away from the touch of phone lines. 

“Dear ——,

I know exactly what you are looking for. Before the breakup old Ma Bell was still looking for new standards. Electronics were moving so fast in those days. I guess that hasn’t changed. They were so sure the next big breakthrough was right around the corner. 

Up until then, most people thought phone lines were just electric lines to carry your voice around. The truth was that they could always carry all sorts of information, like this message you're reading. We knew what was coming, at least had an inkling, and we wanted to be on top of it.

A team of our best developed a new standard for phone lines. They were incredible, I’m talking hundreds of times the data with near zero corruption or loss. We could have leap-frogged past fiber optics. 

The problem was the noise. Tests picked up nothing, but if you actually listened to anything sent on the lines it was obvious. 

We built eight full test lines, built on a spectrum of compatibility with current systems to full usage of the new tech. 

People on the team started saying that if you listened to them in order, you could hear the more powerful lines more clearly. 

What you could hear was not the messages we were sending.

The project was shut down when team members started dropping. 

The test lines were laid in early 1981. By 1984 every inch of line had been destroyed. 

The telephone network is an amazing link. A living, changing network connecting millions, potentially billions, of voices, all free to drop in and out of a never-ending conversation at any time. There are places it never should have reached. Voices that never should have joined. Voices that I know still poke and whisper at the fringes.

I still think I can hear them. I think I can hear them better every year.”

Immediately after I read that e-mail I received another.

“Can it hear us?”
