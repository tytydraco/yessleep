"Yo, Johnny-boy!" My head snaps over to Zander. I wouldn't have even heard him at all if it weren't for the fact that he was literally only a foot and a half away from me. Even still, I only barely heard him over the cacophony of hammering guitar riffs and howling vocals engulfing the room in an adrenaline infused chaos. It also didn't help that when he spoke, the fucker's nose was buried in a set of double-D cups from one of his little groupies who was dry-grinding on him. "Yo!" he called out again.

I slumped out of the LazyBoy I was vegged out in and stumbled my way over to him. I remember I was about five or six drinks in, along with about 8 or 9 shots of Jack, so I was at a point where my legs felt like spaghetti noodles, but could still walk without busting my face on the first step. "What's up, dude?" I slurred.

"Johnny... Johnny-boy, my bro..." He giggled before having the girl's boobs pressed in his face again. He pulled his face back out and said, "Dude, you gotta try those brownies in the kitchen. They're fuckin' *fire,* man!" I looked toward the kitchen.

"Really?" I asked. "Who made 'em?" He didn't hear me, his face being submerged again. I clapped, "Yo, Zander?" The girl shot her head over to look frightened at me before pulling back off of Zander. She got up then and walked off.

"Wait, what the hell, where you goin'?" He looked over to me and was like, "Dude, the hell? What'd you go and scare her off for?"

"The brownies, dude," I replied, ignoring his annoyance, "Who made 'em?" He started giggling again.

"Oh yeah, man, those fuckin' brownies are on *point!"* He did a "Chef's kiss" gesture and added, "Yeah, Aaron made some the other day when he was over here and made a whole bunch of the shit. Dude, when he told me this shit will taste like they were baked by fuckin' angels, he wasn't capping. He said you'll feel like an angel too, like you're leavin' your body, man."

I stared intently at the large baking pan sitting on the counter in the kitchen. "I'm telling you, you *gotta* try at least one!" I exchanged glances back and forth between him and the brownie pan.

"They taste that good, huh?"

"Bro, I promise you, try one, and you'll be fucking set." I looked at him again. His face was lost in a giddy haze.

"You eat one tonight?" I asked. He nodded gleefully before holding up four of his fingers. *figures*, I thought. Dude never could stop at just one or two pot brownies. Some people just can't help themselves, can they? Of course, I guess I don't really have room to talk, now do I?

I shifted my focus back to the pan in the kitchen. The brownies admittedly *did* look delicious. I had a thing for fresh brownies, minus the sweet leaf. See, I wasn't one for weed, or any other stuff like that. Not for any real reason other than I'd never tried it before, and I preferred to stick with my usual method of losing myself -- drinking myself into a stupor until my body feels like a brick of lead and everything that comes out of somebody's mouth is the funniest thing I'd ever heard.

That and, thanks to every experience I'd ever had trying to smoke cigarettes ending with mee puking after only a few puffs, I wasn't real big on the idea of having to smoke anything, either. Again though, I'd ever *tried* weed before, and I wouldn't have to smoke anything, so...

"Yeah, okay." I said, still eyeing the pan, "I think I'll try one."

"Attaboy! Yo, hold up before you do, though, let me grab a couple more before you do."

"Bro, I thought you already had *four* of 'em. Leave some for someone else, ya fuckin' pig."

"Bro, they're gonna be gone once you dig into 'em."

"What? Bro, I'm only having one, not the whole fuckin' tray." He started cackling wildly.

"Oh trust me, you ain't gonna stop with just one. Not these. I swear, I think Aaron put crack cocaine in these things or somethin'." I frowned and looked back at the brownie tray.

*Great, so there's probably crack in 'em, too. No wonder Zander pigged out on 'em.* He bounded up from the chair he was in and darted for the kitchen, pushing his way past the crowd of people clustered together in there. Funny enough, regardless of how "heavenly" these brownies were, no one else seemed interested in them. I'm guessing that Zander was the only one who'd even attempted eating one, probably by scaring off anyone else that dared to try. Who knows?

Anyway, so I make my way to him to find him grabbing four or five of them before scurrying off, shouting to me, "They're all yours, bud!" I looked down at the pan. Almsot half of the pan was gone. I looked in the direction he ran off in. *Only had four my ass. fuckin' hog.*

Looking back to the brownies, I picked one up to find that it was moist, yet firm. Spongy, just like the way my aunt used to make 'em when I was younger. *I wonder if they melt in my mouth the way hers used to?* Without thinking too much more on the subject, I popped the brownie into my mouth.

Now, bear with me because one thing was certain, this didn't taste much like a normal brownie. Yeah, yeah, it's a pot brownie, but... I don't know, it just tasted... *off.* It wasn't bad or anything. Quite the opposite actually. It was delicious. It tasted sweeter than a normal brownie, yet with an equally strong sort of savory taste to it. Imagine, I guess, if someone put sugar into a juicy filet mignon and somehow turned it sweet -- and somehow made it taste good. It makes absolutely no sense, I know, but it's the only accurate way to describe what this "brownie" tasted like.

And yeah, surprisingly enough, it *did* melt in my mouth like my aunt's used to. I savored the brownie as best I could, even going so far as to draw out each bite. *'Kay... Well at least it doesn't make me wanna vomit.* Thing was, I wasn't exactly feeling anything from it yet either. Granted, again, I didn't know really how it worked with pot brownies, meaning I didn't realize the effects weren't automatic. *Maybe I have to eat more of 'em?*

That made sense to me, I mean, Zander *did* say that "You can't just stop with one". So I grabbed another and crammed it into my mouth. Once again, this one tasted just as delicious, as well as just as odd, as the last one. Now, one thing I noticed at this point was that, despite these things being pretty sizeable, at least the size of my palm, if not a bit bigger, and as thick as they were, it didn't *feel* like I was getting any fuller. It was like as soon as I swallowed them, they just evaporated or something on the way down my asophagus.

I remember burning through about two or three more before I noticed a sort of tingling sensation pass through my body. It sort of tickled while also muffling my nerves, making my body sort of feel limp. Unlike how I was used to with the liquor, the way I was feeling now was a lot more numbing, almost paralyzing, in fact. What I mean by this is that, though my arms were still there and would even start to twitch a bit, I could just barely even feel it. My arms may as damn well have not been attached to my body at all.

The same was trued with my legs, too. My limbs, the muscles in my face, everything started to go numb while my tongue became dry as a damn bone. Now, I know you're thinking "Yeah, big deal, you scarfed a few pot brownies for the first time and you're wigging out cause it's kicked in", right? Well, here's the thing, while everything I've described thus far may be "normal" when it comes to edibles, or just weed in general, but I'm pretty sure we'll all agree that what happened next *wasn't* "normal".

Now by this time, I'm of course starting to wig out mentally a bit, wondering what the hell's happening to me. *Why can't I feel anything? Why's my mouth so dry? Why do I feel so light all of a sudden?* I realized quickly exactly what the word for what I was feeling was. Ironically, the word would be "emptiness". I was essentially hollow. An empty shell, standing in the kitchen. I moved my eyes around. Everything still *looked* normal for the most part. All except for one thing, that is.

It was when I looked over to the living room again that I saw it for the first time. What to call it and what it is are two questions that neither I, nor anybody I know of, could ever hope to answer. In the far corner of the living room, somehow standing completely unnoticed by the throng of people who were gathered around the area, was the tall, blackened shape of a man, standing at least my height, 5'9", with this extremely demented, toothy, straight up wolfish grin on its face, staring dead at me. My heart immediately began jackhammering in my chest.

*The fuck is that!* I blinked rapidly a few times, believing that the weed was just feeding off of my paranoia, you know? Basically, I went in with anxiety, and so the weed would basically amplify that. That was my understanding at least. That is, until I quickly realized shadow man in the corner *wasn't* going away. Not only that, but correct me if I'm wrong, aren't you still supposed to be able to actually *move* parts of your body while you're under? I know it's supposed to be able to relax you and all, but you should be able to do at least simple movements such as, say, moving your arms to try rubbing your eyes to make sure whether or not you're just seeing shit?

Yeah, well, not me. My body was a marble statue or a mannequin, perfectly still and lifeless, seemingly cut off from my own consciousness. I know, it's weird to explain, but basically I could see and hear everything happening around me just fine (though admittedly, I noticed that everything seemed to move a bit slower than I thought it should've), but I couldn't actually interact with anything. My mind was somehow disconnected from my body. Internally, I was screaming, crying out both for someone to help me -- somehow -- as well as for someone to watch out for the shadow figure who, at this time, I started to notice was creeping closer and closer. I could hear myself as well trying to shout at it directly, wondering just who and/or what the hell it was and what it was doing.

The shadow came closer and closer, slowly creeping. It's stride toward me was like that of a spider, with long steps across all four extremities. The whole time, neither I nor it broke eye contact. It smiled deviously, ravenously, at me while I stared back in nothing short of sheer terror. Once it'd closed about half the distance between where it was before and where I was in the kitchen, I watched its mouth open, unnaturally distending almost to the point where its bottom jaw was actually touching the floor. In a voice that was distorted like someone had gone and chucked one of those toy voice changers down a flight of stairs, yet also strangely familiar, I heard the shadow say, "A new vessel. It's been so long..."

*What the... "vessel"? What is this thing, some kind of demon?* I could feel my brain start to pound in accordance with my heart beat. I was about to be possessed by a fuckin' demon!

I felt myself try to struggle again, but to no use. Part of my brain, of course, was still screaming at me that this wasn't real, that there wasn't a demon coming for me and that I just needed to keep my head about me and everything would be fine. Then the shadow figure decided to abandon its little "creepy crawly" gimmick in favor of just rushing me for the kill. If I'd had any sort of control over my body, I'd have seized up, throwing my hands in front of my face while screaming.

Of course, thinking back, I probably wouldn't have even had the chance, regardless because of how fast the thing bum rushed me and the next thing I know, I'm having what feels like a needle-studded brick if iron get stuffed down my throat. Somehow, don't ask me how, but *somehow,* despite not being able to feel any part of my body only a second ago, I spent the next thirty or so seconds in excruciating pain, pain that I couldn't even react to, outside of my inner consciousness, as the shadow thing wormed its way down and throughout every part of my body. I guess, thinking about it a bit more, it felt like whatever this thing was, wasn't just taking my body, it was trying to assimilate *me* as well. It wasn't just gonna stop with my body, it would've taken my soul too or something.

That's the best guess I've got anyway, because, unlike what the movies show with this sort of thing, its not like there were flashing lights, freezing air, shit floating around the room, or my head spinning 360 degrees like an owl. No, it was just me, standing there in front of a tray of brownies, probably looking to everyone else like a goddamn statue, like I just had an aneurysm or something. No, everything that was happening to me was real, but I was the only one that could see or feel it.

There weren't any sounds, either, not even from the space around me. That much, I didn't even notice until after the thing had wormed its way into me for a good fifteen or twenty seconds. Everything was on mute for me and the only thing I could, I guess "hear", was the sound of my inner consciousness screaming bloody murder while the thing started moving parts of my body around, having completed its little hijacking process. It took a second to move my arms and shit around, checking itself out like it was in a fitting room, before looking up ahead into the living room to see everyone gathered round the area me and Zander were in just before coming into the kitchen.

Now, I couldn't hear anything, but from the looks of panic, with people's hands covering their mouths, I could sort of guess that the thing's attention was snapped by the sound of someone screaming. Something was wrong, but what? At first, the thing stood still, not wanting to investigate apparently.

Eventually, the crowd began parting and I saw that they were all gathered around Zander, who, for no reason (that I knew of anyway), was hammering some poor dude's face into the floor. I remember seeing this and wondering *What the hell is he doing!* Then he rose up and I saw that his eyes were now cherry red, with these white slits in the middle of them, making them look like the eyes of a snake. He was staring dead at me, stretching his mouth in a demented sort of grin like I was about to be the next poor bastard to get their face smashed into the floor. I wanted to start running, but of course, I couldn't.

He rose from the floor slowly, eyes still trained intently on me. Everyone that'd gathered around him began trying to back away, looks of horror chiseled on each and every one of their faces. He began walking toward me, grinning wider and wider with each step. About a foot and half, maybe two feet away from me, his arm stretched out to me and I heard him say in this weird, sort of soothing voice that sounded like the combination of a man and woman's voice, "Brother..."

*"Brother"? The fuck? What is he talking abo--*

My inner voice was silenced when Zander's hand rested on my forehead, looking like something from some Native American tribal ritual or something. Then, from *my mouth*, I heard the same type of voice reply with, "Yes, we are here, it's time." That was the last thing I saw or heard before everything just went out like a light. I couldn't see anything, feel anything, or hear anything. I was gone.

How long it was exactly that I stayed like this, I couldn't hope to tell you. Honestly, I was pretty sure, in some way shape or form, that I wasn't *going* to come to. I figured, whatever had just happened, that was it. I was done for.

Honestly, I kind of wish that were true. When I *did* come out of the darkness, I was in a room I didn't at all recognize. Instead of either Zander's kitchen or his living room, both of which being littered at every corner with trash and scraps of junk food and reeked of weed fumes and alcohol, I was in a clean, warm, cozy looking room that looked a lot like the one at my grandparent's old place from when I was younger. I looked around, at the corners of the room, and then at myself. Slowly, I brought my hands up to my face, realizing I had control of my body again.

Well... Sorta...

My eyes doubled in size when I noticed that my hands weren't *my* hands. The skin on them looked older, like the arms of say, a 50-55 year old, as opposed to the arms of a 27 year old natty like they should've been. I felt across the top of my head to realize that, in place of my raggedy lion's mane hairdo, there was nothing! I sprang up out of the bed I found myself on, where I quickly discovered that doing so apparently resulted in sharp pains shooting up and throughout my body from the small of my back. As quickly as I could manage, I zombie-walked out of the room to find the nearest mirror, where I damn near had an instant heart attack.

In the mirror, instead of seeing me, *my face,* I was looking at the face of some dude who had to have *been* around 55 or so. Wrinkles and fatigue lines creased the bottoms of my eyelids, my cheeks were beginning to shrivel like a dead prune, and when I opened my mouth, I found several teeth missing. I wasn't even me anymore, this was somebody *else* that I was now somehow *inside of.* After taking a minute to let the immediate shock die down, I began to move throughout the house I was in, looking for some kind of explanation.

Looking out of the window, I found that I was on a beachfront property somewhere. People in bathing suits were out walking to the beach with various items like surf boards and things like that. I made my way to the door and went out to talk to one of them. I stopped the nearest one, a young kid and his girlfriend, and asked them where I was. At first, they stared at me, confused, but I guess they just took me for an old fogie who was already experiencing the onset of dementia or something and told me I was at Myrtle Beach.

*How the hell did I get here? Why am I here? Why do I look like an old man? WHERE AM* ***I***\*?!\*

From that point to now, about a week later, I have been searching desperately for an answer to all of this. Obviously, I haven't gotten very far, though, just two days ago, I saw on the news in this condo how two people in Gastonia, where I'm from, were gunned down in a police shootout at a bank. When it showed the faces of me and Zander as the perpetrators, I vomited right there in the living room.

As far as what *actually happened* to me or him, the *real* us, I have no clue. At this point, the best guess I've got as to what's going on is that, somehow, probably because of what's in those brownies, our spirits somehow detached themselves from our bodies, leaving us wide open to get hijacked like that from those shadow things. Of course, why that very moment, only after *I* ate a few, that they decided to sprig their attack, I couldn't tell you. Maybe it was some sort of reunion or just convenient timing. Though, being completely honest, I feel like it was part of something bigger, like there're more of them, waiting to surface like that and assume people as hosts to do God only knows what.

Remembering that Zander had told me that it was our old buddy Aaron that baked the brownies to begin with, I started searching for his address on the internet until I found an article similar to the news report about me and Zander, with him being shot after supposedly attacking and trying to eat three people at the park, killing one and seriously injuring the others. This article, by the way, was just two days after I woke up here in the beach house.

Again, so much of this, I couldn't hope to wrap my fucking head around. All I know now is that, now I'm forced to live the rest of my life as a 50-something year old man with the consciousness of a 27 year old, two of my friends are out there, somewhere, *also* trapped in bodies that aren't theirs, and so are those things; those shadows. Oh, and one more thing, I know that no matter how normal, how delicious, how "homemade, just like how my aunt used to make" they are, I will *never* eat a fucking brownie again.

*EVER!*
