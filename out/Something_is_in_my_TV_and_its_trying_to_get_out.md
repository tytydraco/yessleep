I usually record sports games and TV shows I want to watch because I work nights, so when I come home, I can just rot on the couch and watch. After a particularly long shift, I decided to watch a baseball game that hasn’t been spoiled for me. Rockies and Dodgers. Should’ve been an entertaining matchup, but I ended up falling asleep by the 4th inning. I was dead tired. 

I woke up about an hour later to a pure white screen. It had black lettering on it. 

“HELLO.” 

I assumed that I had just pressed pause on the recording in my sleep and it landed on a commercial. I grabbed the remote and hit the play button. Then the time bar came up and the recording paused. I was confused. I hit play again, expecting it to just be an uncommon glitch with my TV, but the message just played and stayed on the screen. No noise besides a silent static hum that could live in your ears forever if you let it. I rewound the recording a few minutes and saw that the game was there. When the broadcast came back to my TV, it was still the 4th inning. I thought my internal clock was all off. I watched the few minutes I rewinded and back again was the message. 

“HELLO.” 

I was–unsettled. I couldn’t tell if it was real, or if I was really tired. I decided that it was better if I just did something else. I went to turn the TV off, but as soon as I pointed the remote at the TV, the message changed. 

“DON’T.” 

My eyes widened. I froze for a second. Stared at the four letter threat. I went to click the power button, but as my finger descended, the most ear splitting static played through my speakers. I dropped the remote and covered my ears. I could feel the sound behind my eyes and deep in my brain. When the remote hit the floor, the batteries fell out. As the double A rolled under my coffee table, the static stopped. The message changed yet again. 

“BRYAN.” 

I sat silently as beads of sweat formed around my forehead. How did– whatever this is– know my name? Another change. 

“HELP.” 

I didn’t know what to do. I started to get up to find my phone to tell others to turn on the game. I started to slowly rise off the couch. 

“SIT.”
It felt like the silence was yelling at me. I didn’t listen this time though. I continued to get up and go find my phone in the kitchen where I left it before I fell asleep. I made sure to keep my eyes on the TV while I did it. I grabbed my phone and right before the ear splitting static came back, the message changed again.
 
“NOW.” 

I tried to fight the noise but I couldn’t. It felt like if I didn’t go back and sit I would’ve gone deaf. I was worried about my neighbors and that noise but no one came knocking. I struggled to get to the TV but I made it, ears intact. The familiar message from before came back.

“HELP.” 

I walked towards the TV and ushered one word to the screen. 

“How?” 

The word abruptly vanished. Only a white background remained. Almost like the TV was–thinking. 

“PUSH.” 

That stayed on screen for a second and it was followed by another word. 

“HAND.” 

Then it flashed between the two back and forth. I didn’t know what it meant at first. I walked up to the flickering phrase and pressed my hand to the blank space to the right of the words. It was ice cold to the touch. After a few seconds, I saw something out of the corner of my eye. On the left side of the words was the outline of a face. It looked like a face being pressed onto a bed sheet or one of those pin art toys. It was looking in my direction and when I looked over, the impression moved across the screen to my side and disappeared. My hand slowly got really hot and suddenly and without warning, my hand was pulled through the TV. It was a mix between extreme heat and the feeling of being degloved on the other side. I had to put my hand on the wall to sturdy myself and pull back because not only was the pain intense, whatever was on the other side was trying to pull me in. As I could feel each inch of the skin on my hand and lower arm being peeled away, I looked over and saw the message changed.
 
“THANK.” 

“YOU.”

I pulled with all of my strength to get my hand out of the screen. As I pulled harder and harder, the static returned. Through the static was a bellow that shook my soul. It sounded like a cacophony of screams all at different pitches. I then joined the chorus of agony and screamed myself hoarse. I couldn’t feel my hand anymore but the pain was still there. With all the strength I could muster, I reached into my pocket with my other hand and pulled out my cell phone. I started hitting the TV with it, hoping whatever it was would release me. I swung again and again awkwardly across my body, trying and begging through screams to let go of me and make the pain stop. My vision started to fade from pain and exhaustion. I had one more good swing in me and swung hard. The impact cracked my phone, but my hand was freed. I pulled my hand out of the TV and fell backwards. The ensemble stopped and was replaced by a loud and droning beep. High pitched and stomach churning. I threw my phone as hard as I could at the screen. Right before it connected, The face of the screen pressed against the LED and I could see its mouth agape, next to it was a handprint in the same fashion. The message on the screen turned red and was flashing, as if it had some urgency. 

“HELP.” 

The phone cracked the screen and small bits of glass fell onto my floor. The red message disappeared and the incessant beeping was brought to an abrupt and disturbing end. A huge crack shown across the TV. From it a tiny drop of blood came down from it. My hand. It was gone. Halfway up my forearm was missing and it was perfectly cauterized. 

I took down my TV after that. I wiped the blood off and put it on the curb for trash pickup. That was a few days ago. Trash day is tomorrow, but the TV is gone.
