Would you sell your soul to the devil in order to stay alive?

Probably not.

But would you sell your soul to save your child?

I bet your answer just changed.

So when this question became my reality, you can bet your ass I was willing to do anything to keep my son alive.

When Danny was diagnosed with leukaemia I thought the worst had happened. Then when he had a relapse and the chemo stopped working I thought the world had come to an end. When the doctor told me there was a 1 in 8 billion chance of the hospital finding a bone marrow doner, I was sure it was impossible for anything to get bleaker. Now, I’m not so certain. I’m not as optimistic anymore.

You can’t go back after seeing your bundle of joy, of energy and light deteriorate in mere days. After watching your baby gush blood from his nose, bleed from his eyes and vomit up red, I can tell you this; You’ll never be the same again. Hearing your favourite voice whisper to you, beyond fear, 

“Mummy, am I going to die?” 

And you know what’s worse? When you can’t bring yourself to tell the truth, when you have to lie through your teeth while blinking back tears;

“Of course not. Mummy won’t let you die baby.”

That’s when my husband James, a doctor himself - a man who swore he could fix anything for us - started looking into alternative methods. He dove headfirst into his research and never looked back. 

At first I didn’t notice the small changes to the man I married - I was too busy tending to a sick Danny. But the hours in the lab began to stack up and I thought perhaps James was using work as a distraction. Mumbling things I didn’t understand, waking up in the middle of the night to follow up on a theory - I thought my husband was losing his mind. But he wasn’t, not at all. James was fighting, battling to keep me from losing my son.

“Honey?” I can still hear James whispering into the bedsheets, even though it was over a year ago now.

“How far would you be willing to go to save him?”

James’s research uncovered secrets. He crossed boundaries and theories more twisted and more unsafe than Frankenstein himself. And this is what he decided;

After months of trial and error it appears Danny, my precious 6 year old, will only survive under one condition. We combine the bone marrow - which is essentially spongy tissue - of multiple different people, producing a cellular match to his. However we cannot use ordinary people; we require marrow from brains of people who are wired differently, who moral compass does not function like ours. Marrow that has properties that are more malleable, less controlled - heightened adaptivity. 

Which brains possess these qualities? Psychopaths. 

The twisted logic is that psychopathic brain, with its lack of empathy and heightened impulsivity, creates an environment in the marrow that can bond with foreign cells - like those needed for Danny’s survival. 

Psychopaths.

The science behind this discovery is confusing and unsettling, I can’t lie, I barely understand it myself. But I do understand one essential thing. I am prepared to do anything to save my baby. And that’s what I told James, and tell myself again as I watch him inject Danny with a strange, spongy mixture he has gathered from fresh corpses of known murderers. 

Is it lawful? No. Is it moral? No. Is it the only solution I have left? Yes. 

It’s unthinkable, but it works. James promises me it’ll work. You cannot judge me until you have watched your child go to hell and back too. 

When James is done, I sit at Danny’s beside anxiously waiting as I hold his hand. A million memories dance through my mind in a single abated breath. 

My baby curling his tiny hand around my finger, clutching hold of me for the first time. 

His bubbly laugh as he knocked over his toy blocks for the thousandth time. Always the troublemaker. 

Taking Danny to preschool for the first time, watching him examine himself warily in the mirror. The other children had hair and he didn’t. 

My baby tapping me on the shoulder from his hospital bed that was far too big for him. “Don’t cry Mummy. I’m not going anywhere.” 

Danny’s hair growing back in little curls when chemo wasn’t the answer. 

Riding his new bike with strength he didn’t realise he had. 

Bumping his knee and it flowering black and blue. 

Another trip to the emergency room. Far too many.

One way or another, I won’t be taking my boy back to the hospital again. I smile gently as I clutch his hand to my chest. 

“Come on Danny, wake up,” James urges desperately. “We’ll find out any moment now, honey.”

I close my eyes and pray to the highest heavens. Please lord, it’s worth anything, just keep my Danny with us. 

His fingers feel limp - has he already gone? Is my son still here or am I clutching his shell? But when I’m brave enough to open my eyes again, Danny is staring back at me.

“Ohh baby,” I gasp softly, “Oh Danny!” 

My husband and I lean across the bed and hug our little boy tight, tighter than ever.

“What’s that son?” My husband pulls back as Danny murmurs something quietly. 

Danny looks from James to me and fixes his gaze straight into my eyes. But there’s something different, something off and a chill creeps into my spine. His eyes are focused, so calculated - this is not the stare of a 6 year old. 

And then in a voice so soft, so cold, Danny’s words echo across the room;

“I said, I’ll kill you in your sleep tonight.”
