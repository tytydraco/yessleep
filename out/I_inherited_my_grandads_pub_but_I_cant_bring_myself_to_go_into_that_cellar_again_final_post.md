The creature had taken a young woman, a tourist from London, who’d accidentally wandered into the cellar in search of the toilet. According to her boyfriend. Which really meant, inadvertently I had killed an innocent young woman by leaving the doors unlocked. The guilt made me so sick I couldn’t look anyone in the eye for a while. The woman was younger than me. She was on holiday with her boyfriend, who I saw sobbing incoherently to the police when Mike and I returned to the pub.

I decided to be honest with the police. To an extent. I didn’t tell them about the monster but I told them everything else. If they arrested me on suspicion I decided I deserved it. When they questioned me I told them about the tunnels, I showed them the key and I even explained how I’d gone exploring down there and then decided to take a turn to the manor house. They searched down there but didn’t find any trace of the girl. No blood. No belongings. I even told them about my walk back through the wetlands and Mike and I’s walk up from the mouth of the tunnel. But I didn’t tell them that Mike saw the monster drag the girl into the water.

Personally, I would’ve arrested me instantly, because that is the most suspicious and ridiculous story I have ever heard. But the police decided to let Mike and I go. The story in the paper read “Tourist gets swept away in the tide in hidden tunnels underneath local pub.” They said she must have gone looking for the toilet, then came across the tunnel and decided to have a look. She went too far and drowned as the tide came in. They suspected her body would wash up on shore in the next few days.

What shocked and disturbed me the most from all of this, is that the local town did not seem to give a single fuck about what happened. Life went on as normal. If I lived round here and my local pub had a girl go missing and secret tunnels underneath. I’d stop going there. And I’d assume someone had murdered her and it was a cover up. But no one seems suspicious of me, or my pub or anyone or anything.

There’s a question on my mind that is troubling me. The door to the tunnel locks and I don’t think the monster can unlock doors otherwise it would’ve gotten through the trap door. So how was the monster getting inside the pub before last night? Who left it unlocked before and then locked it again? And was it on purpose? My first thought is that my grandfather’s memory decline made him forget. But thinking over the conversation the monster repeated back to me at the manor is making me suspicious of him. I’m getting suspicious of them all.

Since the girl’s disappearance I’ve been going about my life in a daze. A daze that revolves around the tides and is preoccupied with the monster. I’ve locked the door to the tunnels and the living quarters now and don’t plan on unlocking them for a while. I don’t sleep here anymore either. Instead I take the drive to Mike’s place.

I was just starting to feel a little better when another person went missing. A teenage boy with a sweet braced smile in his picture in the paper had disappeared into the sea. He was active at the local church, always helping out, and was seen going down into the basement. Then he just seemed to vanish. People think he was abducted from outside the church. But I knew it was the monster.

I know this because the police found two sets of bones in the basement of the church a few days ago. Arranged in a letter M on the cold stone floor were the bones of a young woman and young man. The tourist and the boy. This put the nail in the coffin of any suspicion that might have lurked in the town about me and my pub, because I was seen on CCTV in Mike’s area getting out of my car when the boy went missing.

Speaking of Mike, he moves around in a daze too. He quietly smokes himself into oblivion after work pretty much every day and other than that he sleeps. We don’t talk much anymore. We just sit on the sofa and try to tune out the thoughts with reality TV. I sort of looked forward to our time spent decaying on the sofa, it was still better than being alone or constantly looking at the pub living quarters door expecting something to open it and pop its head round.

It was when I was closing up for the night, just after midnight looking forward to another night time rotting session with Mike, that I suddenly heard a knock at my door. I looked over to see a tall shadow standing behind the frosted glass. Tiredly, I groaned and marched over to the door. I had just locked up and now had to go through the motions of unlocking the door again. When I pulled open the front door, standing in the doorway was a tall grim looking clergyman with grey hair and a high collar.

“May I come in?” He asked, his accent soft and well spoken. I nodded and stepped aside, the gravity of him being a clergyman making it hard to turn him away. He looked around the pub and I thought I saw a faint smile in the corner of his mouth.

Then he sat down in one of the booths and looked over at me as if he was pleased to see me.

“Pint?” I asked. “On the house.”

“Yes please.” He smiled. I didn't like his smile. Too toothy.

While I watched him continue to visually take in the pub, I poured him a beer of his choice. Fosters, which instantly made me distrust the man. I placed it down on the table in front of him on a beer matt then took a seat across from him.

“I suspect you know why I’m here.” He said, taking the glass in his hand.

“It’s about that boy isn’t it?” I avoided his gaze, rubbing my thumb over a stain on the table.

He nodded solemnly before taking a sip of his beer.

“Yes it is about that boy. He was very dear to me and the community. And now he’s gone.”

“You think I did it?”

“No.” He gave a look that told me he knew about the monster. But before I could ask a clarifying question he asked: “Are you God fearing ma’am?”

I hated being called ma’am. Made me feel like an aged matron. “No. I’m an atheist.” I told him.

“I see….Without the promise of heaven, why do you do good things?”

“....That’s a bit of a big question for afterhours.” I chuckled nervously. The clergyman just stared at me. “What’s your name by the way?”

“You’re avoiding the question. And it’s Father Reed.”

“Well Father Reed. I do good things because I know they're good or because they make logical sense.”

“And would you do a good thing even if it meant you had to endure negative consequences?”

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“The outcome and the negative consequences. I’d break my arm to pull a child off a cliff for example. Or I’d give my cousin a kidney. But I wouldn’t make myself late for work to help an old lady cross the road y’know?”

“So you like big heroic acts of self sacrifice.” He grinned over the top of his pint glass.

I stared at him like he’d just insulted me. “Huh? What?”

Continuing to smile he got up from his seat. “Thank you for the beer Miss Merton. I must be on my way now.” He nodded to me, the low ceilings made him look awkwardly, eerily, tall.

“Bu-”I began. He put his hand out to stop me mid sentence.

“I really must be off.” He shook my hand while smiling in a way that unnerved me, then promptly left, shutting my door behind him. I stood in the middle of the pub on the red patterned carpet utterly dumbfounded.

Then my phone began to ring, the sudden sound making me jump. I took my it out of my pocket to realise it was my auntie Tanya. She never calls me.

“Hello?” I said cheerily into the phone, pleased to hear from her.

“Sh.” She hissed. “You- you need to leave.”

“Leave? What do you mean leave?”

“My mum and Kevin, they’re-” She began to cry. Suddenly there was a gasp and the phone call ended.

As if on queue I heard the pub door open and this time Mike appeared in the doorway. He looked dishevelled and panicked.

“Come on. We’re leaving.” He instructed.

“Okay.” I nodded, grabbing my hand bag from behind the bar and following him out to the car park. I didn’t question him because well, after all we’d been through if he says we need to leave I’m going to trust him. He looked around the car park as if he was looking for someone. Then hurriedly, he climbed into the car and I climbed in next to him.

He put the key in the ignition and I leaned back trying to get comfortable. Suddenly I felt a large hand cover my mouth. Then something sharp quickly stabbed me in my neck. I caught a quick glimpse of my attacker in the mirror. My uncle Kevin's eyes stared back at me in a way I can only describe as bloodthirsty. The pain that seared through my neck was the last thing I remember before the world went dark. I reached my hand out for Mike but it went limp as I graced the sleeve of his hoodie.

When I finally opened my eyes again I saw nothing. I was surrounded by total darkness. The total absence of any light at all made me start to panic. I had never truly experienced it before.

“Help!” I yelled helplessly into the void. “Is anyone down here?! Kevin you bastard I’ll have you!”

There was a long empty silence.

“Whitney!” I heard from somewhere deep down in the void.

“Mike!” I crawled toward the sound, relieved that I wasn’t alone. Then I felt the damp ground beneath me and realised; the tide was in. The disappointment made me start to weep. I was going to die alone in the dark. Or I would be dragged into the sea by a murderous wide toothed monster and drown. I didn’t know which fate was worse.

As I got up from the floor I realised there was a heavy weight in my pocket. I put my hand in there as I started fumbling my way in the dark. Hand in my pocket, I ambled away from where the sound was coming from. I took it out and from the shape alone I realised it was a swiss army knife. There was something else too. A lighter. I lit it up. The brief light revealed that it was auntie Tanya’s favourite sparkly pink lighter. Which made me laugh through my tears. I used the light once more to make sure I was heading straight on and then on my fumbling legs I ran from the monster for a second time.

I decided if I was going to die, I was going to cause the monster as much damage as possible before I went down. With unsteady hands, I pulled the blade out from the pocket knife and held it ready for when I was caught. This is the only time when I think it’s appropriate to run with a blade. I figured maybe I’d impede its ability to hurt someone else the next time it came knocking if I did some damage on my way to my watery grave. My feet pounded against the wet ground as fast as my numbed legs could go. Horrifyingly, I heard the thing scuttling along the ceiling above me. Then I realised something. My mind reasoned this next part out in a few seconds. If it was on the ceiling it was just as likely to catch me if I ran toward the sea than if I ran to the pub. Where the door would certainly be locked. The tide was in but not so deep yet that I couldn’t swim through it. I hoped. Taking a leap of faith, I turned and sprinted so quickly my bitch P.E teacher who called me lazy in year 8 would’ve cried with pride.

I must have thrown the monster for a loop because it froze for a second before it scuttled on after me. It began to repeat horrific things to me again. Voices of the past in agony and terror echoed through the cave and my skull. But it had the opposite effect to what the monster wanted. It’s cliche but I wanted to survive for them. And I also didn’t want to be another voice for it to torture it’s next victims with.

I knew that boulder I saw as a teenager was coming up. Mike and I climbed over it on our way up. I kept checking with my lighter and soon it was in the near distance. The one I hadn’t been able to scale as a teenager. Desperately, I threw myself on it and yanked myself onto the top. The gap between the boulder and ceiling was quite narrow and it gave me another bright yet foolish idea. I lit the lighter and watched the monster scurrying toward me. Its face was ravenous and delighted at the prospect of my tender flesh. I resisted the urge to scream and run. Instead I crouched, knife in hand, waiting for the right time to strike.

When it’s grinning face was inches away from mine I sent the knife into its black beady eye before yanking the blade back out. A slimy blue substance sprayed from the wound and splashed across my face. The monster screamed in its own gurgled voice. Hearing it’s true voice almost made me feel sorry for it. I hesitated to run. As if I wanted to know it was okay first. Then I saw panic twist the creatures grin into a grimace and instinct told me to bolt in the opposite direction. I hopped down off the other side of the boulder and kept on running.

With the flame from my lighter I saw the water coming up. But I also saw the light of the moon coming in. It was faint but full of hope and mercy. I jumped into the water and started swimming as soon as I was able to. I was in the monster's element now and any head start I could get I had to take advantage of. Especially because I’d have to hold my breath as I passed through the mouth of the cave. Which might have been the end of me. And there was a chance that if I did make it out into the channel that I’d get swept away with the tide and drown. If the monster didn’t get me first.

As the mouth of the cave came towards me I ducked my head under the water and swam like hell through the darkness. When I saw the light I finally popped my head up for air. The moon had never looked so bright. It felt like my heart skipped a beat with glee. It was in my moment of distraction that the monster made one last attempt to get me.

As I turned to swim to the shore I felt a sharp piercing searing pain in my leg. The pain was made infinitely worse by the salt water. The monster had its jaw clenched around my calf. Thrashing around, trying to break free, I screamed in agony. It dragged me down easily in my distress. Soon I felt myself losing air and started to drift down lifelessly.

For a moment I thought to myself at least I got the bastard in the eye. And maybe the next family member my horrible elders try to feed to it can get the other eye. Mike will remember me. I had fun. It was a good life overall.

It is true that before you die your life flashes before your eyes. Mine was a dreamy haze of childhood beach days, emo teenage years and my messy but fantastic uni years. A slideshow of my best memories. Then I saw a white light like a circle and faces started to look through it. One was my grandmother. But they all looked very confused.

“What?” I asked them. They pointed behind me.

Suddenly, I opened my eyes and saw something fly past me in the water pulling me from my dying dream. A rope! It had a weight on the end to send it down. It was just within reach. I gripped my hand over it, feeling my skin wear against the rope as the monster continued to drag me. I held the rope with a vice like grip enduring the blisters already forming. Putting all my strength in what could’ve been my final moment, I started thrashing around again. Desperately, I took the knife from my pocket and this time I stabbed the monster in the throat. In agony, the monster let go of me for a moment. I yanked the rope hard to let whoever had thrown it know that I was ready to go and began swimming for the surface.

Holding its webbed hand to its bleeding neck, I watched the monster swim away, disappearing into the murky depths.

With the help of the rope I swam to shore. Throwing up salt water and gasping for air, I pulled myself onto the wet sand.

“Hi!” Mike dropped the rope and ran into the water to help me out. I threw my arms around him and let him help me on to dry land.

There were a hazy few moments which I don’t remember so clearly. But I recall Mike patching up my leg as best he could with his own hoodie. When he took it off I noticed he had red splotches on his white t-shirt. I didn’t have the energy to ask him where they came from. He also had a nasty black eye and a split lip. As he helped me hobble across the beach and on to the road he made a phone call. I heard my auntie Tanya’s voice, which sounded distant and shaky but couldn’t make out the words. I heard a man’s voice too, a voice I thought I recognised but couldn’t quite put my finger on.

Mike sat me down on a bench and for a while we waited underneath the dim light of a street lamp. He watched the road eagerly, pacing back and forth while I tried not to pass out. The street was completely empty that night and there was a chill in the air despite it being summer that made me shiver in my soaking wet clothes.

A black car playing 80’s rock and roll slowed down in front of us. When it stopped Mike opened the back door and placed me in the back of the vehicle. The sound of the music felt so out of place and stupid that the feeling of being pissed off spurred me on to survive. The car stunk too, of cigarettes and stale beer. You’d think, being a pub owner, I’d be fine with that smell but it was mixed with sweat and the smell of greasy food. Overall it didn’t help with the queasiness I was trying not to give into. Mike climbed in next to me and we started driving, the driver of the car disobeyed the speed limit and whipped around corners. Which threw me into the side of the vehicle and hurt my injuries.

“What kind of fucking uber is this?” I mumbled looking at my Auntie Tanya in the passenger seat, her blonde hair tangled and speckled with blood spots.

There was a chuckle and a deep voice said. “Welcome to Dad’s cabs where we provide the finest passenger experience in Britain.” A man I recognised as my father, but about a decade older than when I last saw him, peered over the driver’s seat, his green eyes topped by too bushy salt and pepper coloured eye brows. And below them was his big stupid nose and his dirty untamed beard. I swung for him but my fist missed and smacked the side of his seat instead

“Oi! Eyes on the road.” Tanya demanded. My dad laughed and turned back to face the road.

“What’s wrong kid you’re worried we’re gonna- Weheeeey. Woaaah.” He pretended to swerve into oncoming traffic causing cars to beep at us.

“Charlie! We’re meant to be keeping a low profile.” Mike hissed at him.

I have no idea where exactly we’re going or what stupid plan my dad has cooked up. I don’t even know how and why he got here in the first place. I’m sure he’ll start yapping about it soon enough. Boasting about coming to save me and what not. God I hate this fucking loser. Not only am I slowly bleeding to death in the back of a car that should’ve been scrapped in the 2000’s, the last thing I might hear could be my Dad slurring his way through fortunate son. Can’t believe I faced off against an ancient sea beast and my reward is a wound stinging from salt water exposure and a tour of England's motorway system.

As I was grumbling to myself in my head I caught Mike’s eye. He was barely containing a laugh.

“What’s so funny?” I snapped.

He just shook his head and said “Jesus Christ.” While he laughed at our situation. I couldn't help myself and I joined in laughing at our expense. We both looked like we’d been dragged through several hedges and been in a drunken brawl at the end of it.

Also I’ve realised something, I’ve titled these posts with “I can’t bring myself to go into that cellar again.” But I spent five posts wandering around down there. There’s a message there somewhere. Or maybe I’m just a fucking idiot. Clearly it’s hereditary.

I think I’ve said all I needed to about this topic. Obviously I’m giving up the pub and I never intend to go back. I know I leave you with a lot of unanswered questions but I obviously need to keep a low profile for a while. Also I don’t see myself having any proper answers that I want to share for a good while. So for now goodbye lads, thanks for all your help, starting to think I should’ve just hired a druid or Vudu queen like you guys recommended I should.

I have, however, noticed something. My Auntie Tanya has an old leather bound book in her lap that she’s holding to like it’s a saucy Chinese takeaway she doesn’t want to spill in the car. And on the cover of this book is a beautifully ornate letter M.

Luv ya and wish me luck in my new post graduate plan of living as [an off grid fugitive](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mx7i0q/my_family_made_a_deal_with_the_blue_blawere_hes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), XXX
