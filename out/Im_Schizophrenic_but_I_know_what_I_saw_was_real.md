# I’m Schizophrenic but I know what I saw was real.

Three nights ago, I decided to explore an abandoned building near the infamous Montauk Project site. The stories about this place had always intrigued me—whispers of experiments that blurred the line between science and horror. The building itself was suffocating, its long-forgotten corridors filled with decaying walls and a silence that pressed down like a weight.

While poking through the rubble, my flashlight beam caught something unusual: a dusty VHS tape half-buried under debris. It was old and worn, the label on it faded except for the clear, bold numbers: **“013.”** My curiosity overpowered my unease. I pocketed the tape and left the building, the chill of the place lingering on my skin.

The next day, I bought a VHS player. Something about that tape demanded answers, and I wasn’t going to let it sit idle. For an extra thrill, I decided to return to the building where I found it and play it there.

The sun was setting as I approached the structure. Shadows stretched across the windows, and I swear I saw something—a figure, motionless, staring at me from the second floor. My pulse quickened, but I reasoned it was just my imagination. Brushing it off, I stepped inside and set up the VHS player.

The tape started with static, a hiss filling the room. Then, voices:“Are you ready, 013?”“I want out,” a deep, guttural voice replied, each word laced with malice.“Alright, let’s get started—wait, what are you doing?”“I’m going to kill you,” came the reply, the tone now entirely inhuman.

Chaos followed—shouts, crashes, and screams. A screeching sound, unlike anything I’d ever heard, pierced the air before the tape abruptly ended.

But the nightmare wasn’t over. Above me, from the same window where I’d seen the shadow, came the unmistakable sound of footsteps. Slow, deliberate. Then, another screech—this time, not from the tape. The sound was identical, but real, and it was coming closer.

I didn’t wait to find out what was behind it. I grabbed my things and ran, not stopping until I was back in my car.



That night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every creak of the house made me jump. Around midnight, I heard something I couldn’t ignore: footsteps. This time, they weren’t above the second floor—they were in my attic.

Grabbing my gun and flashlight, I called my buddy, who thankfully agreed to come over armed as well. Together, we climbed the ladder to the attic, the cold air biting at our skin.

The space was suffocating, the silence almost tangible. As our flashlights scanned the room, I noticed scratches on the wooden beams—deep gouges, as if something had clawed its way through. My stomach churned.

Then came the screech. It was deafening, echoing off the walls and freezing us in place. From the far corner of the attic, something moved. My flashlight caught a glimpse—a grotesque figure with glowing eyes, its skeletal frame and twisted limbs unlike anything I’d ever seen.

“Shoot it!” I yelled, and we both opened fire. The thing screeched again, retreating into the shadows. We didn’t wait to see where it went. We scrambled down the ladder, out the door, and into the safety of the night.

Once outside, we called 911, barely able to explain what had happened. The operator’s skepticism was clear, but they promised to send someone over.



We knew we couldn’t stay at the house, so we packed what we could and left. On the way out, we stopped at a neighbor’s house to ask if they could keep an eye on things. As he agreed, I noticed something strange: a small tattoo on his wrist that read **“013.”** He noticed me staring and quickly covered it, offering a vague excuse.

Shaking off the unease, we drove to a nearby hotel. By the time we arrived, exhaustion was catching up with us. We checked into our room, triple-locked the door, and inspected every corner. The room seemed normal, but the tension was suffocating.

After settling in, we decided to run to the store to grab dinner. When we returned, we froze in the doorway. Sitting in the middle of the room was the VHS player, the same tape inside.

“What the hell?” my friend whispered, his voice shaking.

We immediately called the police, telling them everything: the tape, the attic, the creature, and now this. Two officers arrived within the hour. They listened, but their skepticism was clear.

“Alright, let’s see this tape,” one of them said.



This time, the tape began differently. A timestamp appeared: **1/13/1994.**“Subject 013: Experimental Cognitive Variance,” a voice announced.

The audio crackled, and screams erupted. A younger voice, presumably 013, pleaded for release. The sound of electric buzzing followed, growing louder. Suddenly, a crash—metal restraints breaking.

“Restraints breached!” someone yelled. Chaos erupted. The audio captured the sounds of bodies being thrown against walls, panicked screams, and desperate commands:“SECURITY! Get him back in the—”

A guttural, otherworldly screech drowned out the voices, and the tape cut to static.

The officers exchanged uneasy glances. “That’s enough,” one of them said, reaching to eject the tape.

But then, the room went cold. The lights flickered, and a low growl filled the air. From the shadows, the creature emerged—its glowing eyes and skeletal frame unmistakable.**I’m Schizophrenic but I know what I saw was real.**
