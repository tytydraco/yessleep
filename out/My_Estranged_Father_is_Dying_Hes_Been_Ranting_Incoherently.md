Have you ever been having the perfect dream, one where the world feels safe and kind for a moment, only to be jarred awake at the pinnacle of happiness by an alarm. You wake up melancholy, mourning a life you never lived. Then, back to the mental labor farm. Spiders paying the flies to build their webs. 

That’s how it felt when I received the phone call. I’m an introvert and maybe not the best socially because of that. I stay to myself and keep only those I feel comfortable around in my life. That’s why I was filled with dread receiving a call from the ICF my father is in.

 I didn’t know much of my father, mostly just what my mother had to say. With the alcohol wearing her down to a shell of a human in my teens, she was practically lobotomised by the pain she felt. I wasn’t understanding or mature enough at the time to rationalize what she was going through. Talking of my father was a hair trigger for a gun that only fired at its wielder, in my mother’s case. His decline broke her. I suppose that’s why she never let me visit him. He never was a father. He was an anomalous entity floating in the ether of my young imagination as a what if. He was more akin to Santa or the devil in belief and presence in my life than a tangible parent.

 Now that she’s gone and I’m an adult, the reemergence of my father’s existence weighed on me like a cancer diagnosis the same day as a pregnancy announcement. It wasn’t fear per say, but to say I was nauseous would be an understatement. I felt as if a parasitic worm had burrowed its way through my intestines one inch at a time laying eggs as it navigates my digestive tract. 

I barely remember the phone call. Only snippets and blurs. I remember feelings and my automatic reactions to words but not saying or hearing anything. Vaguely, it went something along the lines of: 

“Hi, is this Ryan?”

“Yes, this is him.”

“I’m your father’s primary Direct Support Professional. My name is Julie. Your father has taken a bit of a downturn in health recently. You may not be his guardian in a legal sense, but you are his next of kin. He requested you by name. He says a lot, mostly incomplete scattered thoughts. Although, he was very clear and adamant in regards to saying your name.”

From there, I shut off. Mostly “mhms” and “yeahs” escaped my mouth like death row prisoners scurrying past the guards only to be caught shortly after. I nodded a few times and had to clarify vocally that I understood because I forgot she couldn’t see me. The words were masks for anxiety and apprehension, but all amounted to acknowledgments and yeses to her ears. I was too caught off guard to say anything else. The call ended.  

“11 AM Saturday?” I whispered to myself, questioning how I managed to set a day and time without being consciously present. I may not know him other than slurred insults and teary eyed shouting from my mother’s recounting, but he was….is…my father. If he doesn’t have much time left, I might as well honor his request. 

Since leaving school and graduating, time moved like reruns of a tv show out of order. Sure I recognize the characters, but now I don’t know where we are or what happened the last few months. You go to bed January first and wake up to hear it’s already the end of April. Then, its Halloween, and you have no plans. Oops, Christmas came, and you’re behind on gifts. Oh, back to January first. Wait was it still January this whole time? No, the year changed. One year older and still the same pay. 

That encapsulates the week leading up to seeing him. I worked and made small talk about my coworker’s kids or their new grill. I couldn’t tell you much else. I woke up, and it was Saturday at 7 AM. I usually don’t wake up until later, but sleep eluded me like the exit to a  never ending hallway. I was too anxious to eat, so my stomach grumbled yelling at me to have some food. My throat filled with liquid fear, telling me anything I tried to eat would be promptly used to choke me with vomit. I sat there for hours not knowing what to do to pass the time.

 7:22

 Wait? 22 minutes? That’s how the next few hours remained as I cycle through apps on my phone only to instinctively reopen them to the same posts seconds later upon closing the app. I needed some water. My mouth was bone, and my tongue was sandpaper. The fridge was empty besides some expired milk. Had I forgotten to get groceries? This week really did fly by.

 The tap water came out brown at first. Not risking that. Better tell maintenance. Oh well, right? Not so bad. Almost time. I’ll grab a water from the vending machine when I head out. 

8:15 AM

 I guess I’ll just lay here and close my eyes. Thoughts were both too fast all at once and too slow to get to the point before my brain shifted to a new thought.

 9 AM

I’ll just go early. Visiting hours aren’t until 11, but it’s an hour drive. I get down to the lobby of my complex and go to the vending machine for a bottle of water. The fluorescent light from the vending machine gave me a headache in the dimly lit, charcoal room. “Card Reader out of ORDER,” said the folded over, poorly taped index card attatched to the machine. I take the few crumpled bills I have out of my wallet. Each one is spit out. My dollar bills were discarded like bones from a constrictor’s last meal. 

The outside was an overcast day just as gray as prison walls but above every person who decided to look up. I had a standoff with a car that couldn’t decide if it wanted to let me cross or not. The traffic behind them honked and decided for them. I ended waiting on the entire line of cars before I could walk to our parking lot across the street. Orange vests and cones brightened up the scenery with their loud machinery and yelling working away at the potholes in the lot. They gave me dirty looks before I got into my beat up car and pulled past them without reciprocating a look. 

The hour drive dragged on as I tried to navigate unfamiliar roads a leading to a winding, complex parking lot. As I pulled in, I ignored the woman at the front desk and fast tracked towards the water cooler. Fuck, I forgot to take my pills. The feeling of the heavy gulp and strained swallowing reminded me. 

I let her know who I’d be visiting and she gave my a smile so artificial you could preserve eggs for a year  with it. “Oh, really?” She squinted, “I’m sure he’ll be delighted to see you.” 

Eventually, I was outside in a common room with tables, games, chairs, and a few televisions. Some heavier set and older patients strolled around in walkers. Most seemed to be in their rooms, though. A woman in scrubs came out of a room with a few empty plastic cups. Her brown hair folded around the back of her neck like arches in the way it curled. She was probably in her mid or early thirties and had a smile I could actually believe. “Ryan? I’m Julie, one of your father’s DSPs. Just so you know, I think I’m his favorite staff,” she smirked and paused briefly. “You look just like him, the nose and everything.” She tilted her head slightly to the side. 

I broke my nose getting knocked over by a Great Dane and smacking my face on a brick wall when I was 9. My mom didn’t like going to the doctor, so I never got it formally checked out. I snore pretty badly now. I told everyone at school that I broke it by fighting a 15 year old. I won that fight. Well, that’s what word around school would have been if I had friends to share the story. 

Julie’s dark eyes bordered on black with an azure tint  swirling in them like the color in a magic 8 ball. I felt… safe. Reassured at the very least. I’d hope that someone in this line of work would have that effect. 

We talked, and she settled me down by asking me to sit at one of the circular tables in the middle of the room. It was covered in Uno cards with two hands of cards laying scattered. Looks like someone was winning by quite a lot. An elderly man in a blue robe and checkered pajama pants scooted closer to her, mumbling just barely to Julie. Certainly not any volume I could understand, but she perked up seeming to register his statement. “Lunch is at 12, Doug. You know this. Go on and get changed for the day, and it’ll be lunch in no time,” he grumbled slightly and spoke what I believed to be “okay” but sounded more like a phlegmy exhale. 

She turned her attention back to me as more staff walked in from the hall, and another exited a bedroom with hands outstretched in gloves and a look of disgust on her face. After throwing the gloves off and vigorously washing her hands, she looked up at a clock ticking the time away with a sigh. For me the clock sounded like the cracking of ice below my feet counting down to the arctic plunge that is my meeting with my father. What I hadn’t noticed before now wouldn’t leave my ears like a gunman in a standoff with police over a hostage.

 Click, click, chip, chip, crack, “Ryan,” click, click, “Ryan?”

“Ryan?” I looked back, honing my attention back to the conversation. “Long night?” I nodded, sucking in my lips to not let more embarrassment slip out of my mouth. “Your father his a sweet man when he’s cognizant. I want you to be aware what you might see when in his room. He slips in and out of awareness and thrashes in bed from time to time. If he’s not present with us mentally while we’re in there, he’ll be saying completely unrelated and detached things. Don’t be worried. His eyesight has been degrading over time and he’s attached to a feeding tube in his stomach. He used to be able to eat, but if he has one of his…episodes while eating it could lead to aspiration. It’s better to be on the safe side. Just talk calmly and ask questions. If he says something rude or out of line, he doesn’t mean it. Does that sound ok?” Her clinical delivery mismatched or initial aura of her comforting tone. 

“Yeah….that…that’s fine.” 

“Great,” she smiled before dropping it to nod her head in acknowledgment with sympathetic eyes. Before I knew it that door was open and she was reassuring me that she’d be right outside the door if he or I needed anything. 

I don’t know what I expected when I opened that door. I guess a sunken, hollow set of cheeks with speckled skin, and a balding head. What I saw was indeed hollow physically and emotionally. He stared blankly off into space with his mouth half hung open, his teeth hidden by parched, dry lips. One eye had progressed with a glossy blue-white film further than the other. She wasn’t kidding about his nose. It was freckled and drooping in age but curved to the left at the bridge like a meandering stream. Just an aged up version of mine. I looked at him with a grim admiration before being brought back down to earth with the sharp vibrations of his voice rattling my ear drums like the warning of a venomous snake. His voice was deeper than I assumed it’d be. “Juuuu….lie?”

I felt disappointed, sad, and anxious to face this at all. As I was about to speak, I was interrupted. “My son. Rine. Is Rine coming?” He couldn’t fully articulate my name, but the desperation and hope was evident in his voice. 

“It’s me, Dad. It’s Ryan.” He pulled his blanket higher up under his chin and shifted his lost gaze back and forth, caught off guard by my unfamiliar voice. “Julie called me and said you wanted to see me.”

He settled and looked past me. I sat in the chair placed by his bedside. “Rine, oh Rine, they told me to tell you. They told me to tell you. Oh, tell you…tell you,” he trailed off. He seemed saddened by his inability to remember. His demeanor shifted to solemnity. “I don’t remember. It was important.” He looked like a disappointed child not being able to remember the fun fact he learned at school he was sure his parents never could have known about dinosaurs.

“It’s ok, Dad. Take your time. I’m sure you’ll remember. I’ll be here as long as you need me.” I don’t know if I was being honest or pretending to be kind. My mother’s influence rubbed off on me, warping my perception like taffy in summer heat. 

“How are the Johnsons? Is their boy gonna be a pilot still. He loved his airplanes.”

“I don’t know who they-“

“Your mother didn’t let you see me.” The stark shift in the air around his words cut like a butcher into meat. Fast, hard, and deadly. “I didn’t do anything. It’s not my fault. Cough, cough.” He looked like an old, worn down man. He wasn’t much older than my mother was. They may have had me later in life, but no man in his 50s should look this evaporated, this weak. 

At this stage, I wasn’t seeing the limiting factor or reasons for her hatred, her need for total separation. He just seemed like a sick man whose body has been degraded by illness. That was what I saw at first. Then, he froze. 

His body became like snapshots of still images playing in succession. It was like trying to catch the light moving frame by frame as you hit the switch to turn it on. He was a marionette moving in staccato, jarring spasms. His mouth hung open, and the blind eyes rolled back to hide any color that may have been left at that point. He started speaking. 

His voice was strained and stretched thin around the environment around him like a glove that wouldn’t quite fit. A black echo of death and wetness enveloped my ears. 

“Elaine….Elaaaaa….The trees…..the fire…RUN…ignore….don’t look……can’t…save…. ABOVE!”

“Not….Animal….Not….ALIVE….Mo-”

“SAVIOR…CONQ-”

His voice hitched in a high pitch. The breath held on as if it ended, it would never exist again. The lights flickered, afraid of what they illuminated. They returned to normal, as did he.

 I looked around expecting the world to react the same way my heart had, rushed, frantic, and clumsily. Nothing changed. The birds still chirped. The machines still beeped. No one came in. My father still looked past me. My mother’s name isn’t Elaine. 

“Rine, you look the same as the last day I saw you.” 

He hadn’t seen me since I was a toddler at most. The years are hazy from a time where memories are more suggestions of fact from another than reality. He still wasn’t even looking AT me. “You got a haircut. Finally shaved that terrible mustache. Still the same. Still my boy.”

He shot up to 90 degrees with no creak of the bed or shifting of bones. His movement was silent. A vacuum, a void of noise, moving as if incorporeal. He turned his head to the side and began to stand. I was too panicked and stunned by the sight before me to react. He walked with a divine purpose and intent. He could walk through brick and the atoms would bend around him because they would be too afraid to disturb him. 

He walked to a table on the far side of the room, dragging his gastronomy tube and pump with him. The rolling device fell on him without a flinch from him or a shift in demeanor. The tube pulled out of his stomach with an exhale of the balloon and no reaction or wince. Gastric acid and feed lightly bubbled and stained the ground in a yellow-brown rain of disinterest. He systematically moved his limbs as if puppeted by God himself with robotic, surgical precision. He could pick up a grain of rice with boxing gloves. He picked up a sheet of paper and began writing in it while maintaining a forward gaze to not look anywhere lest the world see him back. Upon finishing the writing, his body froze in military order and collapsed like a deflating balloon of meat and bones, a crumpling can in a hydraulic press.

The caretakers and nurses began moving past me as my as my jaw lie on the floor. They maneuvered around it accordingly. I couldn’t hear anything but could feel the vibration of what would be sound if I could comprehend my senses. As they filed out to grab necessary equipment and moved his body to resuscitate him, my trance brought me to the note. My vision was a vignette with borders of my sight blackening to be hyper vigilant of what lie in front of me. 

‘READ

FOLLOW

 COME’

Below that was a brown, leather-bound journal. I didn’t consider decision making when my arm outstretched and shoved the journal into my pocket. 

Hours idled away sitting in an ill sized lobby chair. Julie came to me, the blue peeking through the black in her eyes had shifted from day to night, snuffing out the sapphire light. “I’m not supposed to be telling you this.” She grasped my arm clinging to it like the railing of a balcony. “We don’t know how this happened. His internal temperature elevated so high that his brain practically deformed and melted. His brain was cooked by his own body all at once. It was-“ she whispered, “it was fucking flash fried in the time it took for him to make it across the room. He didn’t have a fever. It wasn’t slow cooking him or detectable prior to this. It just…HAPPENED.” Her sorrow and disbelief came out in vocal skepticism and an unsteady pitch. 

“Did he ever say anybody to you about a journal?” I rushed past comforting her and jumped straight into selfish, gnawing curiosity. Did you know that squirrels gnawing on power lines are responsible for a large portion of power outages? My words cut through, and I saw the lights shut off in her momentarily before warily answering.

“Yes. He used to write in one all the time. Before his sight went, he wrote in it every time after one of his episodes. I didn’t want to invade his privacy, but he usually just mumbled the words he was screaming during the incidents as he wrote. He probably stopped writing in…December? That’s when he lost majority of his sight. So about 5 months ago.”

“Thank you.” 

The drive home was longer than prior. I don’t remember any of it. so it might as well not have existed. I can’t recall one second of it, not one car, red light, or any traffic. I only remember sitting in my lot. The construction workers were gone. Now that I think of it, I don’t think I saw anyone out either. In the car, I flipped through the journal. Each page was all dated. Many pages were filled with scratchy writing that was hard to make out but legible. 

These weren’t personal thoughts or a means to release emotions. They were all stories. These stories couldn’t be his own given what little I know about him. I flipped through further, and something caught my eye. The dates stemmed back years, but that wasn’t the full extent of it. I got to December. It was only halfway through the journal. After that, the writing was clearer. Perfect penmanship. Perfectly spaced. Impeccable.  The only clear distinction was that it only began after December. 

I’m gonna read the entries when I have more time. I’ll share what I can in case anyone has a better idea or insight than I can provide. For now, I need some time to think. I need to share these thoughts with anyone who will listen. I can’t shake the urge to write them down since I’ve gotten home.
