I’m sorry it’s taken so long for me to get back to everyone. Things have been a little busy lately and reliving what I went through didn’t really help. I just needed another break and time to myself to sort things out and get in the right headspace. I am ok though, and I am no longer being controlled or manipulated by the entity. Thankfully I got away with a little help from that John Doe back at the bar. 

I remember going through hell a thousand times over. Feeling my skin bubble, boil, and pop from the heat. Fingers breaking and teeth shattering from biting so hard cause of the pain. I still get nightmares and glimpses of it from time to time. I’ve almost collapsed from the headaches I get remembering everything. But I’m trying my best to cope. 

So, here’s how I got out. John Doe came in after I was there for a couple of days. He said he had a bad feeling that I actually went there to investigate. When he found me, he said I was curled up covered in blood and my eyes were rolled back. The weird thing was, was that I wasn’t in a cellar, or in any hole for that matter. Where I was though, was right in the entryway. Just lying there and if I had never fallen through any hole at all. So, he dragged me to his truck and brought me to the hospital. 

He told me that as we were arriving, I began waking up and becoming conscious again. For me, that’s when I started to get back to the real world. To this reality. I tried getting off the cart, but the nurses wouldn’t let me leave and I ended up getting restrained. So, because of that, I spent a couple weeks in the hospital. Got questioned quite a bit, but I was still in daze and don’t remember much of those conversations. Twenty-three stitches and a couple of unknown fingernails were pulled out of me. That’s what they looked like at least. So, because of that, police questioned me and kept an eye the whole time I was there. A good visit to the psych ward and visiting a psychiatrist was how I spent the remainder of my time there. Too bad it wasn’t the psychiatrist I knew. Speaking of him, I haven’t heard from him in a while. He did email me however, but I was unable to open it because computer time was over. 

Finally, after being released, I got a ride back to my vehicle and paid John Doe for his troubles. On the way to get my vehicle he tried talking to me about what I went through. What I experienced, but I wasn’t ready to talk about it yet. I gave him my information and told him we’d be in contact. Anytime I meet someone on one of my cases that turns out to be real, they want to learn more. So, they go out searching themselves. Some make it back, some on the other hand don’t. That’s why I usually recommend the only psychiatrist I know to talk them out of it. He sort of knows what I do, but also doesn’t believe and things I’m crazy. I don’t blame him; I mean the guy talks to crazy people for a living. Once I get my stuff back and settled somewhere I’m going to try and get in contact with him.

M. “So you think I’m crazy?” 

G. “No, I believe that you are as you put it. Searching for things, to deal with the trauma of losing your parents.” 

M. “I watched my parents die. There’s not making that up. Police came and found me, there was a whole case. You can look it up.” 

G. “I’ve read the reports and I’ve heard your story. I have also gone over these so-called cases you’ve investigated, and they all seem… fabricated. As though they were made up in your mind to create some sort of closure.” 

M. “So the news clippings, the audio recordings, everything is just fake? I paid people to speak and created fake newspaper articles?”  

G. “Let’s get back to the matter at hand. You’re here because you believe you’re looking for a certain creature. Am I wrong?”

M. “I am looking for something. Yes. But I have no idea what it is yet.” 

G. “This could all just be in your head. How about this, you go on some antipsychotics and check in in a few weeks and see how you feel. In the meantime, enjoy the scenery and the town. We’ll be in touch.” 

AUDIO TRANSCRIPT CASE LOG 11 OVER. 

That was one of the last times I had been in contact with my psychiatrist. Actual face to face contact. We had talked over email a few times here and there. Just to discuss my mental health and what happened in that small town of Indiana. That was one of the toughest cases I had to investigate. But that’s for another time. 

You may be asking why I brought up my psychiatrist so easily and quickly. Some are probably also thinking, well this guy's insane, he has a psychiatrist. Nothing he’s saying could be true. I promise you it is. When I say I search for things, I do. Whether the cases turn up true or not is a whole other story. For instance, when I said I was searching for a wendigo. I was, do I typically believe in everything I’m told? Not all the time, but it doesn’t hurt to just check it out. But to get back on track here’s why I brought up my doctor. 

He emailed me a month or so ago asking for help in a case he’d been assigned. Apparently, a bunch of people have been going missing from this town and he wanted my expertise on what it could be. Crazy right? A person with a doctorate asking their patient for help with something. He seemed worried though in the email. He said he thinks something might be coming after him. I tried emailing him back a few times but there hasn’t been a response. I’m only a few states away, so I guess it doesn’t hurt to check it out. So, I packed up what little things I said, checked out of the hospital, and heading to wherever my GPS was taking me. 

Along the drive I kept getting flashes of the entity I had run into. I’d see him on the road, or I would see a light flashing like it wanted me to go that way. I just ignored it and kept driving. Although, sleeping when needed didn’t really excite me. I’ve been plagued with nightmares and sleep paralysis since the incident. So, I usually try to stay awake for as long as I can. Tonight though, I couldn’t do that. 

As I laid in my back seat ready to take on the dreams, my mind had a different plan. For once there was nothing. Not a single thing in my dream. Just black, like when you close your eyes in a dark room. That’s all I saw. Hearing noises here and there occasionally but nothing terrifying happened. I awoke to a beautiful sunrise, went into the rest stop to get a coffee and headed on my way. I felt refreshed, and probably the most well rested in a long time. Then as soon as I got onto the interstate a massive wave of pure darkness surrounded me. While trying to move, I heard something speak to me. “You can’t hide forever. I will find you again.” Before I became face to face with sunken in dark eyes and an eerie white smile. Then I awoke, to the sun just about to come over the horizon and a pit in my stomach. Crawling up front, I grabbed a cigarette and went to get some coffee. 

Getting back on the road and to my destination was a little difficult. What if I was doing what the entity wanted, what if this was another ploy? But I had to shove those thoughts down with another cigarette and keep on driving. It was about twelve more hours I finally reached the town. Driving through the main road, I realized it was kind of a nice quiet place. There was a beautiful forest on one side of the town and a nice number of stores around the place. After admiring the place for a while, I decided to get a motel room and start my investigation. 

After getting everything set up and my items in order, I set out for the main road to look around and see if there was anything suspicious. As I was heading down the main steps, I saw an outline of someone standing behind a lady at the counter. Knowing who and what it was, I wanted to ignore it, but I needed all the help I could get to find my friend. When I reached the counter, the lady looked up in a happy manner and said, “Everything with your room ok?” 

“Yes, it’s perfect, thank you. I just had a couple of questions on whether or not you’ve seen someone. I’m looking for an old friend.” 

“Well, who might you be looking for sweetie?” 

“His name is Greg and he’s a psychiatrist. He came here to help with some things going on around town. Have you seen him?” I replied while handing here a picture of my doctor. 

“Hm, he doesn’t look all too familiar. The only psychiatrist I know we have in town is Mark. He lives about three blocks down main and is in the only brick house on the block.” 

“Thank you, I really appreciate the help and the room.” 

“Have a good one!” She finally said as I began walking in the direction of the man’s house. 

While walking down main, I felt a little off. As if thought I wasn’t supposed to be here. An overwhelming sense of dread loomed over me as I laid my eyes on a wall. On the wall was about twelve missing persons flyers. Examining them I was able to make out that the first one disappeared about a month ago, and the latest one was about a week ago. There didn’t seem to be any correlation between any of them. No pattern to follow or other clues to help. The first was a little kid and the last was an adult male. Everyone in between were different ages, races and genders. My initial instincts said it could be a cult or serial killer, but they don’t strike this fast in such a small amount time. I pulled out my camera, took a picture of the wall, then started my way to this Marks again. 

The lady at the desk wasn’t wrong, she explained it perfectly. Three blocks down and the only brick house on the block. Well, brick foundation and a white house, but it was the only house on the block with brick. Making my way up the driveway I began thinking of what to say and ask to this man. Did he know Greg? Has he seen or met him? All thoughts cut short as a man exited the front door and made eye contact. 

“May I help you?” He asked while straightening his tie. 

“Yes, if you could talk for a few.” I replied gesturing to sit in some chairs on his porch. 

The man gave a quizzical look as if he was trying to debate whether or not to speak to me. He looked down at his watch, then back up at me and spoke. “I guess I have a few minutes to spare.” While sitting down I asked, “Mind if I record?” He nodded in agreement, and we began. 

AUDIO TRANSCRIPT CASE LOG 27 NAME: MARK LOCATION: SMALL TOWN MISSOURI

M: “So what’s been the deal with all the missing persons around here?”

MG: “What are you? An FBI agent or something?” 

M “Or something. I’m an investigator of sorts. I just don’t work for any agency. I go around to places with strange occurrences.” 

MG “It sounds like you have a disassociation disorder. Do you have a hard time telling whether you’re dreaming or in reality sometimes?” 

M “I don’t have a disassociation disorder. I am perfectly healthy and fine. I’m also not looking for a new psychiatrist. Mine actually came to this place to try and figure out why so many have gone missing. I was wondering if you by any chance have seen him?” 

Sliding a photograph of Greg to him, mark picked it up and examined it for a minute. Before setting it down and replying. 

MG “Interesting, but I haven’t seen him. Why would he come here to look for missing people? And if he’s your psychiatrist, why is he buying into your delusions?” 

M “They’re not delusions, and because I helped him one time see the bigger picture in things. How about we talk about the missing people. No bodies or anything have been found?” 

MG “Not one, to be honest I was thinking about trying to find them myself. Some folks think it’s an urban legend, others think cult.” 

M “Well, what do you think? And tell me about this urban legend.”

MG “Well, I don’t know what to think. I find it odd how people just up and vanish without a trace. It’s not normal. No one just leaves without a trace. When most flee, there is always at least a little part that shows that. But with these, they’re just gone. Poof.” 

M “And what about the urban legend?”

MG “Back on the non-reality train I see. Ok, so the urban legend has many variations. One, is a monster that snatched people and takes them into the woods. Another is a gate to hell that people seem fascinated into going down, and the last… Is about a creature that lures you into the woods and holds you captive. Before finally letting out one massive screech for all to know the persons soul is gone. But they’re all old tales parents used to tell their kids to scare them.” 

M “Well, you seem a little shaken up.” 

MG “How so?” 

It was at this point that I began to notice Marks’ mannerism change. His voice got a little scratchy and his hands shook a little. He was completely fine until he began telling me of the last legend.

M “Well, considering you were fine telling the first two, I’d say you don’t believe them. But the last one, your voice changed, and your hands shook. So that either tells me, you got cold, or you just came to the realization of what might be out there.” 

MG “There’s nothing out there… At least that’s what I used to think.” 

M “You saw something didn’t you?” 

MG “I didn’t see anything… I heard something. A screech, I thought it was in my head. But you coming to me with all this, makes me rethink what I heard. I have to go though.” 

M “Well here’s my number if you think of anything else.”

With that Mark made his way down his path and got into his car. He seemed visibly shaken and pale as he walked off. There’s always a problem with sharing what I do with people. They either think I’m crazy, or have some little unknown thing happen to them they shrugged off. But once they get done talking to me, that curtain to another reality opens up just a little bit. I’m gonna have to come back sometime soon to check up on him and ask a couple more things. Time to find something to eat though, I haven’t had a bite since the truck stop. Maybe someone at the diner will know something. 

As I entered the diner, I noticed that everyone stopped to take a look at me. Small towns always notice when there’s a new person around. Feeling everyone’s gaze as I sat down was uncomfortable but soon everyone returned to their own table. I pulled out my journal and began taking notes of the things mark had said in our interview. I’d transcribe it in digital form when o got back to my room. But for now, it was noting and cross referencing the urban legends he told me to see if it matched anything I had knowledge on. Sadly, nothing I’ve run into matched. My best guess was banshee cause of the screeching, but they don’t lure you away. They only whale when death is coming. So, unless it’s working with something else that’s off the table. 

As the waitress came to give me my bill, I asked if she had heard or seen anything weird lately.  She chuckled a little before finally saying, “I have not. There was no screeching, no creature running amuck or anything. I don’t know if Greg sent you to see if I’d say something different. But there’s nothing to say, everything’s been normal besides the missing people. But the towns got its best and brightest on the case.” “Wait, you know Greg? Where is he!”  I replied a little too aggressively and fast. 

“I don’t personally know him, he just strolled into town a little while ago. Asking all these questions about the missing people. I told him the same thing I told you. He heard about the screeching from Mark, but being a psychiatrist has to mess with your head after some time.” 

“When was the last time you saw him?” 

“Mark was in yesterday and I haven’t seen Greg for about a week or so. I figured he left cause there was nothing to find. Need anything else?” “I’m good for now, thank you.” I replied handing her a twenty, “Keep the change.” 

While packing up I noticed a man alone in a corner booth staring daggers at me. Trying to ignore it, I put on my jacket and headed to the exit. Just as I was reaching for the door the man grabbed my arm and whispered something to me, before abruptly opening the door and pushing me out. A little confused I began walking down the street, his voice echoing in my mind. “Leave. You’re drawing too much attention. They’ll take you.” 

What did he mean by that, “They’ll take you to.” Is it a cult that I’m dealing with. If so, this is not something I want to get into the middle of. I’ve ran into my fair share of cults, and it never really turned out that well. Most are either dead, imprisoned or just plainly disappeared. As I got back to my room for the day, I noticed a note on my door. Cautiously looking around I pulled it off then began to read it. “If you are seeing this, that means I am gone. You’re in over your head, get out of the town.” The letter wasn’t signed by anyone but I took the warning into consideration. I’ll spend one more day here, and if nothing shows up, I’ll leave town. 

Another night plagued with nightmares and little to no sleep. This time it felt different though, it felt as though entity was warning me, telling me as well to leave. That scared me even more, that this being that has been plaguing me wants me to go too. But it also makes me wonder that if listening to its warnings brings me closer to meeting it. It also kept trying to get me angry enough to come in contact with it. I’m smarter that though. I learned from a man on one of my dream walking cases that sometimes you can materialize a being in your dream if you touch it. Meaning, it’ll come into our universe. There’s different theories on dreams and the power of them. Some say it’s a different universe, others a hell scape, and finally an alternate reality. So if you’re ever dreaming and it seems like something really wants you to touch or grab it. Don’t. Because you could be bringing whatever it is into your world to wreak havoc. And it’d be all your fault. 

Getting passed that, I’ve decided to talk to mark again today. He seemed uneasy and in a hurry the last time we met. It’s Saturday now, so he should hopefully be home and not working. 

Well Mark isn’t home, his house was unlocked and no one was inside. I hope he didn’t go missing as well, I really need to figure this out before more people go missing. As I was leaving his house I heard it, this weird screeching noise that left as fast as it came. After I heard that I knew he was gone. My only lead, just up and disappeared or was taken. 

It’s been three days since mark has been missing and I have no leads or any idea of where to go. I began walking the edge of town until I saw it. There that thing was again. That entity, except this time it just stared at me motionless. Then lifted up its pure black arm and pointed in the direction of where I need to go. Standing there frozen, thousands of thoughts running through my mind until it clicked. When we first met, I was in his domain. Now he’s in mine. But why is he helping me. I looked in the direction of his oily black finger and it was pointing into the woods. When I looked back, he was gone. “Fuck.” I said to myself frozen trying to gather up what I saw. That was the first time I’ve seen it in person since the incident. I just had to push down the feeling of dread and go back to my room to gather some supplies. 

Well, sorry for not finishing this case and sharing it for a while. I’ve been in a… interesting situation. Things went not as planned but let me break down what happened. 

So once I got back to to my room and grabbed my flashlight, gun, water, and a few other items, I began my journey into the woods. It was a pretty beautiful and pleasant walk aside from going into the unknown towards the unknown. There was about an hour left of sunlight when I came across it, an old disheveled building in the middle of the woods. The access road had been covered in overgrowth and fallen trees, so I’m guessing that’s why no one came here. It looked like an old rusted Quonset. Holes all over and windows broken. Almost ready to fall over. 

Shining my flashlight inside I noticed it was trashed. Empty boxes and garbage strewn about, some old furniture and refrigerators tipped. Definitely abandoned for years. Checking the door, it was unlocked and opened with a loud creak. Mice scuttled across my feet as I entered into darkness. Testing the light switches to my right to see if any worked. Thankfully one of the four worked and turned on a light in the back of the Quonset. “That’s not creepy.” I thought as I made my way to the back in the maze of garbage and furniture. When I reached the back I heard some scuttling from behind and turned to see garbage being moved and then ceasing. “Must be rats.” I said to myself as I turned back around to look at a cellar door on the ground. Hesitating as I began to reach down and open it up, I grabbed the cold steel handle and threw open the door. Only to see a “nice” wooden staircase heading underground.

I began my decline into the void flashlight showing the way. It was about fifteen steps until I hit the flat floor to the sight of another door. An old wooden door, cracks and paint chipping off with a rusty crystal handle. As I entered the main room and looked around I noticed a man lying on the floor. Although he wasn’t the only one. Multiple people all sitting or standing in what looked like a paralytic state. Focusing back the the man, he was unlike the rest of them. He looked to have maybe been the newest one there, as he was the cleanest out of all of them.He was dressed in a nice suit, had on glasses and was beginning to grow some scruff. The more interesting thing was the white tube pulsating in his mouth. Everyone in the room had one that seemed to be down their throats. The difference between the one on the floor and the rest was that this one seemed to be bruised and bleeding. Kneeling down to check for a pulse I also noticed blood and bile in front of the man’s mouth. It was fresh. Then it hit me who this was. Mark. 

As I reached for the tube and got my first hand around it before stopping once I heard screeching. It seemed as though the sound were coming from inside of him. I continued to pull it out as Mark was twitching and writhing as the tube finally left his body. When it was out the thing seemed to lunge back at him then focused it’s attention on me. It looked like a close up picture of a tapeworms mouth, but this had tiny little eyes. It began squealing and lunging at me till it finally ceased. Then I heard it, something speaking. I quickly turned on my recorder and listened in again to see if it would speak again. As I stood I noticed something sitting in a throne at the end of the room.

U: “Let my child go.”

M: “This worm thing is your child?”

U: “Everything in here has become my child and you have interrupted my peace.” 

M: “What are you doing to all of these people?” 

U: “I do not have to answer questions to some pathetic mortal like you.” 

M: “You’re not first so called powerful being o have met. You don’t scare me.” 

U: “Ahhh yes, I can sense the fear, darkness and dread in you. It would taste so delectable right now. But this fear isn’t from me.” 

M: “Exactly, I don’t fear you.” 

U: “You will learn to.” 

With that a aura appeared behind the unknown being, and I could see all of its features. It looked like a swirling mass of leathery vines covering its body. They seemed to be constantly moving or pulsating as it spoke. “You will very much learn to fear me and fear what I can do.” 

Curiously and surprisingly I took a few steps closer. As I was able to focus on it more, I got a better look at it. The thing didn’t just have one face but multiple moving about. There was one where its head was, another showed on his shoulder as those vines opened up to make way. Followed by another appearing on its chest and then stomach. The thing was horrendous, each face mis-shaped and stuck in a grotesque manor. Sending shivers down my spine as I stood paralyzed. Fuck this thing is actually terrifying. 

U: “Now I can almost taste your fear of me, but it’s still not as strong as everyone else’s. Curious, what has you so afraid that even my true nature doesn’t kill you.” 

Flashes of the entity went through my mind as I finally spoke. “I’m just looking for my friend, I’ll take him and leave. Then you can continue whatever this is.” 

U: “I can’t let you do that. We need him and all the others to in order to feed us. We have been through thousands of civilizations and planets. We will not stop now. Nothing will stop us.” 

M: “It’s one person… two people gone. You have at least twenty down here.” 

U: “We are many, we need all the food we can get. Soon, you, along with this world will be apart of us.”

M: “Fine. be that way.”

In a quick stupid decision I grabbed the pulsating tube on the ground shoving it down my mouth and swallowing it. I could hear myself gagging and writhing in pain on the audio recording as the thing went further down my throat. Then all black. 

AUDIO TRANSCRIPT CASE LOG 27 END. 

“You are not supposed to be here.” I heard a familiar voice say somewhere in the darkness. “Why not? Is this all it is? Just a black pool of nothingness?” I replied as I slowly drifted around in what seemed to be an endless void. It was as though I was in space but every star had gone out. “I have put you through a construct like this before. Although this abominations is nowhere near the perfectness of mine. There’s holes and glitches all over. Pathetic.” Then it hit me, The entity. I was… inside of his own creation. Almost like a barrier between the creatures world and the entities. Was it protecting me?

“Where am I?” 

“You already know, you are inside a construct of my own making. Don’t want to damage precious goods.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” 

“I have found your friend. I’ll bring you to him, but remember. You owe me.” 

With that I saw a bright light open in the darkness. Once I was able to focus I could see that it was a sidewalk in-front of a hospital. Next thing I know I’m standing on the sidewalk as though the void I was in never existed. It felt so real, but something was off. In the distance the same pattern of birds kept flying by, and the world seemed too quiet. The entity was right, this was nothing like his. The only reason I could tell something was off in the entities was because he showed himself to me. Shaking off the uneasy feeling I headed inside the hospital. 

As I reached the front dest a lady spoke, “Good evening, how may I hhehelp you?” It felt like spikes going down my back as she said those last words. It was not human, it was like something was still learning to mimic. “I’m just here to visit.” I replied as I made my way to the elevator. “Who are you visiting?” She asked as I kept walking ignoring her. Once the elevator doors closed I was able to loosen up a bit and get a grip. Looking at the buttons I noticed the once for the third floor was all black, whole the others were what. “That must be it.” I said to myself pressing the button. 

As the elevator began moving slowly upwards it felt as though an earthquake was beginning to happen. Shaking and rumbling getting work and worse until it made me collapse and the elevator stop moving. As I looked up I saw the unknown creature in the metal doors reflection then disappear. It was not happy with whatever I was doing. Standing up I pressed the button again but nothing was happening. The elevator was shut down, and unable to move. 

I was in there for what felt like hours, then days, trying to get that god forsaken door open. Trapped and starving, fingertips bleeding from attempts to pry open the door. Disheveled, starving and beaten I cursed at the door as I was sitting in-front of it. Until finally what felt like a week had passed, a thin pure black line made its way down the slit between the doors making it open just a bit. I quickly shot up digging my fingers between the doors and prying them open with all my might. It was stuck between floors about one foot of a gap into the third floor. A gap I could climb though, or die by if the elevator fell. As I reached for the ledge and began pulling myself up, I somehow ended up in the middle of the hall standing. Looking around confused the elevator doors closed with a ding and left the floor.

“Huh, somethings definitely could be worked on in here.” I said aloud as I walked through the corridor scanning rooms. Not really knowing what I was looking for I heard a familiar voice in a room say, “How’d we get here?” Stopping in my tracks continuing to listen to their conversation I was finally able to tell who it was. It was Mark. Making my way through the door way I noticed him and a cop talking. The cop glared at me as he shoved his way passed me and left. “What’re you doing here?” Mark asking while adjusting his bed. 

“Looking for my friend, and also you.” 

“Well, you found me, you figure out what happened?” 

“You don’t know do you?” 

“Know what?” 

“That none of this is real?” 

He sat there for a moment puzzled and staring into space. It was as though some mental battle was happening before he finally spoke up, “No. No it can’t be. I got out, I escaped.” 

“I’m sorry but you didn’t. It looked like you did for a moment. Sadly it wasn’t long enough.” 

“Then that means you’re fake you sick fuck! Why’re you doing this?” 

“Calm down. I put myself here to find you and Greg. Not the brightest idea, but we’re gonna get out.” 

“There’s no way to get out, I tried. Nothing worked. By the way, your buddy Greg is a dick.” 

“Yah he can be that sometimes. Come on, we gotta find…” 

As I turned to leave I saw him in the door way. He was covered in some mysterious liquid and panting before saying, “We really need to go, what’s the escape plan?” As I was about to say something I heard the entities voice “I did my part, now you do yours.” With that we got surrounded in darkness before everything went out. 

I awoke on the floor gagging as I could feel the tube pulsing and moving down my throat. I gripped it as hard as I could and began pulling it out. Hearing it screech and feeling it fight before finally letting loose and coming out. Once it was out, I puked and then began to smash the thing against the floor until it stopped moving. As I was on my knees coughing and catching my breath, I looked over to see one of the tubes had gotten back into Mark. That’s how he was back in there. He then jolted awake ripping the thing from within him and began puking. As I was standing up, I saw Greg on the other side of the room from me wiping his mouth.

With that multiple of the weird fleshy tubes slithered towards me wrapping themselves around my legs and up my torso. Fighting and screaming at the pain as these little creatures bit all over my body taking out bits of flesh, I saw it. The entity standing above me. It leaned in close and spoke, “This is where you owe me. This abomination doesn’t deserve life. It is a mockery of what pure darkness can do.” The Entity reached its hand out to me as though he wanted me to shake it. Every fiber in my body was telling me no but there was nothing else that I could do. The pain was unbearable. The creatures were biting and tearing away pieces of flesh. I wriggled my arm free and grabbed him by the wrist, finally enacting a deal I would regret… then he was gone.

The creatures had stopped and writhed away. Slowly slithering back until they stopped. As I began to regain myself, I looked up to see the entity behind the unknown abomination. It was shaking and writhing in it’s thrown, seeming as though it was in the most immense pain of its life. Finally the entity lifted its hands up and grabbed at both sides of the things head. “You are an abomination.” He spoke before twisting the abominations head and ripping it off at the same time. The entity then looked at me dropping the head and saying, “You and I have a lot of work to do. Come, let’s get started.”
