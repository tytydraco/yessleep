I am a poor high school student one day, a student I don't know at school asked me to have a drink in the evening, I didn't accept at first, but he said that the girl I fell in love with would also come and they were going to have a Said to have a kissing party And he said that no one else would kiss "the girl I liked", no matter. how much I didn't want to, I accepted.  He found me after school, I had a strange shiver in me, we took the drinks and a quiet environment to drink. Then "the girl I liked" came. along after drinking a little  and we started the game But there was a problem, everyone around me started to change, I thought it was because of alcohol, but I found a paper on the 
table, the rules were written on the paper.

Rule 1= If the people at this table start to feel 
weird, Don't be fooled by them, they're not human

Rule 2 = If you are going to play a game and it is a kissing game then bad things will happen 

Rule 3 = Don't drink more than one shot of alcohol if you have, skip to rule 7

Rule 4 = If they sense something is weird, tell them you have social anxiety.

Rule 5 = Don't try to have sex with people of at the table, if you do, but there may be risks of getting pregnant and this can happen within seconds and at the same time as the birth Since the child born will not be human, you will die immediately. 

Rule 6 = If sexual offers come to you, politely decline without panicking, if they insist too much, skip to rule 7 

Rule 7 = If you need this rule, God help you, they are about to transform completely, first their nails will grow, then they will grow in length and eventually they Turn this paper into a knife.And stab them in their heart, their hearts will be enlarged, you will not have trouble finding its place, even if it does not come to the heart, even a small cut will give them serious cuts and you will gain time.Good luck

I didn't believe it at first, but people started to get a little weirder, I felt that she was trying to tell me something with her eyes, except for "the girl I liked", and I focused on her eyes with Morse code write SOS And I came to the conclusion that girl was human. A girl I didn't know at the table offered me sex, so I refused as in rule 5, she didn't insist. The kissing game was simple. Everyone is dealt a card. Looking at the number on the cards and the same ones have to kiss but we have three refusals. 
each round it was dealt one more time everyone kissed except me and the girl I like When it was our turn I felt that the was "the girl I liked" starting to change and I refused and skipped rule 3 and had another shot everyone around me started to transform except" the girl I liked" immediately made a paper knife and I killed at all We ran off with "the girl I liked", this event connected us and we got married after high school and had a son. I was out when our son came in high school and I saw our son with the guy who offered us alcohol
