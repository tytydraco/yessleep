I’m sitting on a sofa in a cramped, messy room. The carpet is faded and stained, the wallpaper peeling, and spots of mold speckle the ceiling. Everything about this old house screams disrepair. Next to me on the sofa, an old man with sagging, papery skin sits staring at an empty chair in the corner.

A younger man, somewhere in his thirties, in a suit with the slick haircut and white smile of a dentist, or maybe a realtor, flashes his pearly whites at the old man and says, “Hello sir, my name is Nathan. I’m a spiritual medium. Your family reached out to me and asked for my services. Can you tell me some of what you’ve been experiencing?”

“She’s there,” growls the old man, still staring at the empty chair in the corner.

“Who’s there?” Nathan the medium glances at the chair, back to the old man. “Who is it you see sitting in that chair?”

He sniffs. Wrinkles up his mouth in a frown. “Dunno her name.”

For the record, I don’t believe in any of this stuff. I am here *because* I don’t believe. I’m also recording this entire interaction. The old man. The medium. The invisible woman in the chair in the corner. I make sure to get the chair. Lots of footage of it. I am tempted to get up and go sit in it, but that would ruin this whole charade, wouldn’t it? Anyway. I just keep filming. Nathan the smarmy medium-who-should-be-a-realtor looked confused when he first looked at the empty chair, but is now playing along, full woo woo psychic mode, saying stuff like, “To the woman in the chair—can I ask what you are doing here? What is it you would like to communicate?” Silence, and Nathan asks the old man, “Do you see any change in her?”

The old man shakes his head. “She’s just sitting there.”

A few minutes more of a lot of nothing. The medium decides to cast a blessing on the room to help put her spirit to rest. And then, the old man sits up straight. His eyes go big. He says, “She’s getting up.” Then: “She’s laughing! She’s cursing at us!” Then he starts whimpering. “She’s coming closer! She’s coming! She’s coming! Stop her!” He starts screaming, and the medium leaps up, chanting words of a prayer in what is probably Google-translated Latin. He waves a hunk of burning sage and sprinkles salt, while the old man screams. I get the whole thing on my phone—the screaming, the sage, the sweat on Nathan the medium’s brow as he shouts with increasing ferocity over the old man’s howls, snarling at the empty chair. And when the moment is right, I yell—“Cut!”

The old man stops screaming. His face breaks into a grin as he turns to me. “How was that, Max?”

“Brilliant, Pete, you were brilliant,” I say, angling my phone toward myself and also speaking to the cameras we have set up to catch the psychic at work. I speak to my future audience (you all, who should subscribe to my channel if you haven’t already): “This is Pete, an actor. I’m Max, host of Debauchery and Debunkery, where we used to take a shot for each lie, but quickly realized we get drunk way too fast. Now, we just debunk stuff and get drunk later while laughing about it. The only person who is NOT an actor here is Nathan the medium, who as you can see, quickly began speaking to an empty chair. Nathan, you stated several times that you could sense the presence in the chair… what do you have to say now that you know Pete here is an actor?”

Nathan has lost his charm. He stammers, red-faced, furious at having been set up, looking between me and Pete and the chair as if unsure which of us is the most to blame for his predicament. He insists his powers are genuine and babbles that there is a spiritual energy in the chair, while I go on to remark about how the chair itself is from Target (we bought it this morning), so was there spiritual energy at the department store before we brought it in? He says it must be with the house, then. I tell him how the house itself is a set. It’s actually *my* house, and I live here, and this entry room doesn’t usually look like this—we made it grubbier for effect. “Though,” I add, “I guess you’re right there’s not the greatest vibes. Feng shui has always been a little off in here…”

And I *do* need to replace the carpet. The stains are real. The mold spots on the ceiling are fake.

You get the idea.

Call me Max. (Short for Maxine, or Maximillian, depending on my mood.) I’m currently Nathan the medium’s worst nightmare. “What you are doing is entrapment!” he snarls, his ruddy red face on the verge of tears. Oh, his business is gonna take a hit all right. He keeps barking at me, “You act so sanctimonious, but this bullshit is hurting people. You’re hurting people by dismissing their beliefs, disrespecting the spiritual—”

I laugh at him. “I’d say that’s exactly what you’re doing by taking advantage of people just like you tried with Pete, here.”

“I bet you go into schools and debunk Santa Claus to the little kids.”

“How telling that you compare what you do to lying to children. So you know you’re lying, you just think it’s okay because they’re feel-good lies?”

“You know what? Make fun all you want, but this stuff is REAL. You’re a *fool* to mess with it!” He turns and storms out. My last shot of him is both middle fingers held up. His dramatic exit is marred almost immediately by his return moments later, his face now blank as thrusts a business card into my hand. “For skeptics,” he says. “Call her, and she’ll make you believe.”

“Thanks for the tip, Nathan. Probably won’t though. It usually doesn’t work when people know ahead of time.”

“Call her, she will MAKE you believe,” he repeats again, before turning on his heel and striding out.

I look at the card. It just says MAKE BELIEVE on one side, and on the other is an eye and a number. The eye has a nifty effect where it appears to always be looking at you. The card is matte black with simple lettering. I tuck it in my pocket.

A few days later, Nathan the medium contacts me via text. The episode has already aired. I’m sure Nathan is pissed about it. No doubt he’s getting a lot of emails and calls. He’s getting roasted in the comments. So his messaging me—it’s not surprising. Probably to beg me to remove it, offer to bribe me—I’ve had all kinds of things.

His message, when I open it, surprises me: *Forget what I said about the card. Just throw it away please.*

Now, I’ve always been a contrarian. Had forgotten about the card until that moment. But of course after his request, I go digging it up. The matte black. The eye. The words, MAKE BELIEVE. And the number to call. I call it, out of curiosity, making sure to record the call so I’ll have material later for an episode if this turns into anything. There’s no ringing. Just a voice, connecting almost immediately:

*“The address is* >!*\[redacted.\]*!< *Come if you want to believe.”*

Corny. Probably not worth the effort of a debunk. But the address isn’t too far from my sister’s house, and I have to visit her anyway to help her with a few things and talk about my brother-in-law (he’s battling cancer). I make a note about it and the next day, before I head over to see my sister, I swing by the address.

It takes awhile to find—a small psychic reading shop, more of a nook really, tucked between a bakery and a bookstore. You have to go down a set of stairs to even find the door, and the room is so small it feels like stepping into a janitor’s closet.

The woman inside is neither old nor young. She’s somewhere between 30 and 50, an unremarkable bird of a woman with beady dark eyes and hair like a crow’s wings, glossy black with a bluish sheen. Must be dyed. She’s sitting in a chair in the corner in a long black gown, stiff as a doll that’s been posed. She has only one eye, which follows me as I step in and sit down in the chair opposite her. The other eye is shrouded in shadow. Also, the lights in here are very low. It’s a nice effect. Hokey, but visually arresting.

Props to her for atmosphere.

Minus a few points for being so cliché.

“Hello Max,” says the woman.

So Nathan obviously did give her the heads up. So much for debunking. Even so, I ask her if I can record. She cackles a little and motions for me to go ahead, so I take out my phone and start recording us both, though I don’t have much hope for anything from this given she’s already been prepped for me by Nathan. Still, why not? I clear my throat and say, “I’m told you can make anyone believe?”

“Sure,” she agrees.

“Ok. Make me believe.”

Her head cocks, ravenlike, and she examines me. Her eye drifts to the camera. “Is this really what you want, Max? To be made to believe?”

“Me and my viewers.”

“And your viewers.” Again, that throaty chuckle. “How nice. All right then. Max, the debunker. I’ll make a bargain with you. In five days, if I’ve made you believe, you publicly announce your belief before you end yourself and your channel. If you still don’t believe in five days, nothing happens to you.”

The sheer gall of this lunatic. I can’t help smiling. “End myself and my channel?” I echo. “That’s the worst bargain I’ve ever heard. Why would I agree to that?”

“Because you don’t believe, you believe you won’t believe, and you’re an arrogant shit who wants clicks and making this bargain will give them to you.”

She makes, actually, a very good point.

Also she’s right. I absolutely do NOT believe. I say as much to my camera, and then say, “OK, crazy lady. Fine I accept your bargain but just recording this to note that I have no plans to commit suicide and if I appear to do so and this lady has murdered me I expect her to be arrested.”

She just looks at me with that flat black eye.

“So how are you going to make me believe?” I ask.

“Tell me the names of three people,” she grunts.

“Kenji,” I say. My brother-in-law.

“He dies on Friday,” she says. “Loses his battle with cancer. My condolences.”

“Wow. Ok. This is—I mean, obviously, you did your research.” It’s called a hot reading, when a purported “psychic” will look up information about a subject before the reading and then recite facts about them that seem astonishing to the audience. Nathan told her I was coming, so she obviously looked up my brother-in-law and his condition. My brother-in-law could pass at any time. Friday *is* very specific, but it’s not a bad gamble. I find it in poor taste she throws out his death so casually, though, wagering her whole charade on his ill health.

“That one’s too easy,” she says, as if agreeing with my thoughts. “Who else?”

“Sarah.” My sister, who is going through it right now with Kenji’s illness.

She shakes her head. “Nothing much happens to her in the next five days except for grieving her husband. Name someone else.”

“What? No. You said I can name anybody. I named Sarah. You can’t make a prediction for her?”

She sighs and rolls her eyes. “It’s YOUR episode, Max. There are plenty of more interesting options. But fine. Your sister Sarah forgets a bag of groceries and has to go back for it. Inside are two apples, some herbal medicine your brother-in-law requested that she’ll never get a chance to deliver to him, and chocolates for you.”

This is all so specific. Already, I’m thinking of how it could be staged. Could this woman bribe one of the store workers at the co-op my sister shops at? Or maybe this Make Believe woman has got a bug in her ear now, someone is whispering stuff to her, and they’ve been watching Sarah and the shopping has already happened.

I’m still considering how elaborate this might be, or if she’s just doing what most of these scammers do—lie. The woman says, “I’ll pick the third person because you’re about to say Mateo and yes his wife is cheating on him. You’ll say it’s too easy for me to have guessed. You think I have an accomplice listening and feeding me clues. So instead let’s pick Pete. In three days he has a heart attack from seeing her.”

“Seeing who?”

“The woman in the chair.” Her lips curve in a ghastly smile.

“Pete the actor? There’s no woman in any chair. I paid him to make her up.”

“He’ll call you in three days and he’ll tell you he’s been seeing her. He’ll beg you to make her go away. He’ll warn you. He’ll plead.”

“He’s an actor,” I snap. “Did you hire him?”

“He’ll say that he knew you’d say that, he’ll beg you to believe him. But you won’t.”

Well this last one sounds easy enough to stage, anyway. Though if they can make the stuff happen with my sister I’ll be both really impressed and probably filing a lawsuit for stalking. As for my brother-in-law—it’s disgusting they’d even talk about him that way.

“Oh, Max,” she says as I am leaving. “Take my card. I love referrals. Refer me to someone else and maybe I’ll make *them* believe in your place.”

“Whatever,” I growl, and step out of the place, ascending the stairs into the bright sun. She makes my skin crawl, not because she’s connected to the occult, but because she’s a charlatan who lies without any sense of moral compunction, a parasite feeding on people’s superstitions.

I’ve made it my career to expose people like her. These kinds of scammers are the reason my father ended up losing so much money, destitute and desperately believing that the woman (if she even was a woman) catfishing him was in love with him. He believed she was planning to elope with him until he succumbed to COVID during the pandemic. Exposing the lies can’t bring him back or undo the harm that was caused to our family, but it might prevent someone else from falling for a similar scheme.

When I get home, I review the footage of my encounter with the “Make Believe” woman and decide that next week I’ll splice it with some footage of all her predictions not coming true. It’ll make a decent short reel, I guess, though not dissimilar from other reels where I’ve exposed frauds.

I save the footage and forget about it.

Two days later, on Friday, my brother-in-law’s passing coincides with the first prediction. But his death was already foretold (by the doctors), and I dismiss the coincidence.

For the rest of the day, I am talking to family. I console my sister, Sarah. I spend the night and check in on her every few hours. She has barely stopped crying and hasn’t eaten anything.

The next day, I’m still trying to console her when my phone rings.

It’s from an unsaved number. I don’t pick up.

But it rings, and rings, and she tells me through tears it’s fine, to please go and answer it. So I do. It is Pete the actor.

“Max!” rasps Pete. “Max thank God. She said she’ll count you as a referral. You have to make her go away!”

“Who?” I ask, annoyance like an ice pick in my brain, because I already know who. Already suspect.

“The woman!” he bursts, all but sobbing. “The one in the chair…”

I can’t believe it. This Make Believe lady actually did it. She actually reached out to Pete, paid him whatever she paid him (not much, probably. He’s an amateur actor we found on Instagram. Honestly one of the reasons we hired him is because he came cheap). And now he’s turned his schtick on me.

I sigh. “Yeah yeah very funny. Listen I know who hired you—”

“She said you’d say that!” he bursts. “She said you wouldn’t believe me but you have to, Max, YOU HAVE TO!”

“Ok, look, this is inappropriate. My brother-in-law just died. I need to take care of family matters—”

“YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE! MAX, YOU’RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE ME! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE BEFORE TONIGHT! CALL HER AND TELL HER YOU BELIEVE, OR I’LL—"

I hang up the phone, frustrated. And then I silence it as it immediately rings again. My sister looks up from her chair, eyes red, perplexed. “Max?” she asks. “Who was…?”

“Nobody. Just an actor I worked with on a gig. Nothing to worry about.” I sigh, looking at my silenced phone. It’s still ringing. There are also pictures coming through via text, and messages. Pictures from the photo shoot. All of the empty chair. *CAN’T YOU SEE HER???* He keeps texting. More empty chair pictures.

The man is dedicated, I’ll give him that. He’s a much better actor than I initially gave him credit. Probably should’ve paid him more.

I block his number and forget about him.

Forget about him, that is, until the next day. I’m helping my sister to put things away around the house. The place is a mess, and everything reminds her of Kenji. As I unpack a tote bag on the counter, I pull out a couple of chocolate bars. I ask if I can have one and she calls from her place listless on the couch: “Yeah. I got those for you.”

“Oh really? Thank you.”

“Sure.”

I pull a box of an herbal supplement out. My heart *thumps* in my chest. *This is only a coincidence*, I think. I clear my throat and call, “What do you want me to do with this herbal concoction?”

“Huh?”

“Supplements for… looks like it helps with digestion and gut health—”

“Oh. I…” she goes very quiet and then says, “I got that for Kenji. I… I dunno…”

“Oh.”

I don’t want to ask. I don’t want to, and I loathe the butterflies in my stomach, the way my throat is dry and constricted as I ask her: “Did you forget the bag?”

“Huh?”

“The herbal medicine. When you were out shopping for him, did you leave the bag?”

“Um. Yeah, actually.” She wipes tears from her eyes. “I’ve just been so out of it… how did you know I left it?”

I don’t answer. My heart is hammering now as I go to my phone, search for Pete’s number. Try to call, but there is no answer.

I turn to my sister. “Maybe the cashier kept the bag by accident,” I say. “Maybe they set it behind the counter so you didn’t notice when you walked away.”

She’s too distraught over Kenji to engage with me. Doesn’t understand why I care about the bag. Could’ve been tucked behind the counter, she echoes. I cling to that thought. The Make Believe woman. The Make Believe woman bribed the cashier to hide the bag. And then to put items in it that my sister would normally buy. How else would the Make Believe woman have known exactly what items would be in there? These scammers, I tell you. Blood sucking. It’s insane the lengths they go to.

But just in case, just in case I retreat to the spare room, open my laptop, and check the footage of my recording with the Make Believe woman. Check the date. She told me I had five days. Tomorrow will be five. I have time.

“I have time,” I repeat to myself, wondering why I’m being so uncharacteristically irrational when none of this is *real*? I *paid* Pete. I know he’s acting.

Why the fuck hasn’t he called back?

I call again. No answer.

I go to Youtube and pull up the Debauchery and Debunkery video I released about Nathan the phony medium. My heart settles as I watch it. The medium talking about his craft. This fucking fraudster. He goes on about establishing a “psychic connection” and how time is all wibbly wobbly (pretty sure he cribbed that from some sci fi show) and as a consequence he can see snippets from the future. It’s all nonsense. I feel the comfort of the familiar, my skepticism sliding back into place. The camera shots of my house, the staged front room, the peeling wallpaper and everything. And there’s Pete, sitting on the sofa, pretending. I can’t wait for him to get to the part where I call, “Cut!” and he reveals he’s acting the whole time.

That’s what I need to see, to feel better.

“Hello sir, my name is Nathan,” says Nathan onscreen, introducing himself to Pete. “I’m a spiritual medium. Your family reached out to me and asked for my services. Can you tell me some of what you’ve been experiencing?”

“She’s there,” says Pete.

“Who’s there?” asks Nathan the medium, while Pete the actor keeps staring and says he doesn’t know her name.

And then my camera, zooming in on the chair—

NO

FUCK ME

NO!!!

I freeze the frame. No. No. What the fuck. No.

She’s there, staring out at me from the screen. Staring through the screen. Right at the camera.

The woman from the psychic reading shop.

The video proceeds as normal, the same as before, exactly as we recorded. My blood is pumping so loud I can barely hear myself think, my pulse raging, drowning out the dialogue in the video as the medium leans forward and asks what the woman is doing now. Pete says she’s just sitting there. The camera pans back to the empty chair *but it’s not empty the woman is sitting in it.*

The camera returns to Nathan the medium as he gets up and begins performing a blessing on the room, until suddenly Pete sits up straight on the sofa and announces, “She’s getting up. She’s laughing!”

My throat constricts. My heart sledgehammers my ribs so hard I think I might go into cardiac arrest. The phone camera remains trained on Pete, on his hammy acting—only now, instead of looking hammy, he looks genuinely terrified. He really is a better actor than I gave him credit.

I hear my own voice chuckling under my breath on the recording, trying not to giggle at what I evidently thought was a great performance by our actor. And then finally, my phone pans back to the chair—

I scream aloud, in my room by myself, and jerk back from my laptop.

The woman is standing, lurching toward the camera.

Toward me.

“She’s coming closer!” Pete’s voice screams on the recording.

I’m cowering on the floor, gasping, as the woman steps nearer—nearer to the camera, her face swallowing the screen.

“Cut!” shouts my voice.

Then everything is back to normal. The woman on the video is gone. There’s only Nathan, red-faced and ashamed as Pete and I tease him. I hear my own arrogant voice: “… I’m Max, host of Debauchery and Debunkery, where we used to take a shot for each lie, but quickly realized we get drunk way too fast…”

I slam my hand on the laptop to shut it. But then something occurs to me. If the woman was really there, if I wasn’t seeing things, others must have noticed her, too.

I pull open the laptop again and skim the Youtube comments. All ordinary, and my heartbeat settles until I scroll to the most recent comments. Specifically, there’s a bunch left by the user PeteHamsitup. It’s the handle for our actor. And he has commented, over and over:

PeteHamsitup: *I BELIEVE*

PeteHamsitup: *I BELIEVE*

PeteHamsitup: *I BELIEVE*

PeteHamsitup: *I BELIEVE*

PeteHamsitup: *I BELIEVE*

I check Pete’s instagram account, the one we hired him from. His account is gone. Deleted.

I call Pete.

And while the phone rings—

“Max?” The door bursts open, and my sister says, “Max, everything ok?”

She’s come because she heard me screaming over the video.

“Can you see her?” I ask, trying not to hyperventilate as I turn my laptop toward her, rewinding the video to just before the cut. “Can you see anyone in the chair?”

“What? No, it’s just an empty chair. Max, what’s going on—”

But I push past her without answering. I need to get home, need to get to that staged front room.

“Max—” My sister shouts as I slam the door behind me. I try calling Pete again as I pull out of the driveway. His phone just keeps ringing. I call and call, then drop the phone, swearing as I nearly pancake a pedestrian, I’m so distraught. The pedestrian screams obscenities as I screech by. My phone rings again, and I pick it up wildly wondering if it’s Pete, but it’s my sister, worried about me. I lie that I’m fine, running a red light and careening along residential streets and finally screeching into my driveway, and I leap out, rushing up the front steps, through the porch and into the staged living room area. See the chair. Still empty. Thank God. Everything still the same as on the day of Nathan the medium’s visit.

Nathan.

I need to call Nathan.

“Nathan!” I burst as the call connects. “It’s Max from Debauchery and Debunkery, I need you to make her stop. I’ll…” I pause, stammering over my next words, and grit my teeth and make myself say, “I’ll take down the debunk video. I’ll say you were right. Just make her STOP.”

“Do you believe?” comes the tinny voice on the phone.

“Sure, fine. Just make her stop!”

“If you believe,” says the voice, “you must publicly announce your belief before you end yourself and your channel.”

“Wha—” The blood in my veins turns to ice as I remember the deal. That absurd deal. If I believe… I end my channel and myself. If I don’t believe, nothing happens. *So Max you’ll be fine if you don’t believe*, says the small, rational voice in my head. If I don’t believe. As long as I’m still a skeptic, I’m…

But tears start into my eyes, the phone shaking in my fingers because I’m looking at my texts and there’s a new one from Pete: *Hello this is Jay on my grandfather’s phone. He had a heart attack yesterday and passed away*. Scrolling up to the previous texts, it’s just the picture he sent over and over again of the chair, but now I SEE HER I fucking SEE HER. And now I can’t make myself unsee her I can’t I can’t. And I’m certain that when finally I see her in the flesh again and my five days are over, I’ll end my account and myself and OH, FUCK ME how do I stop it?

“Please help me,” I whimper into the phone.

Nathan’s voice cackles. Only it doesn’t sound like Nathan. I sink down to the floor in despair. And that’s when I find it on the carpet—that matte black card of hers, black like the blackest void in the universe, except those words MAKE BELIEVE and the picture of the eye looking at me and the number. And I remember—

She likes referrals.

I still have a few hours left to find someone else.

So I’m making this final post. Please. Are you a skeptic? You think I’m making this all up? That it’s just nonsense? That I’m a—hahahaha—I’m an actor? HAHAHAHAH. Perfect. Ok. Please. Listen, I BELIEVE, and I need you to look her up. I need you to call her. Call this number: >!\[redacted\]!<. Call her and no matter how skeptical you are, she’ll make you believe. But I beg you to do it soon. NOW. CALL HER NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW

I promise she’ll make you [believe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuincyLee/comments/11nxwz3/welcome_thanks_so_much_for_stopping_by/)
