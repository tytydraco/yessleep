Fight club 3a 

For as long as I could remember, my dad had always avoided me. Skipping breakfast, working late, anything he could to stay away from me. When he was forced to be in the same room as me during family events, he'd stare daggers into my soul. When I turned 12 I'd matured enough to realize he hated me, but why? What did I do to him? It'd be years before I answered that question.

By the time I'd turned 15, I had already tried to run away 3 times, so I doubt anyone panicked  when I was nowhere to be found that morning. They probably thought I'd run away again. Except this time I didn't run away, hell, I hadn't even thought about it for months.

 I woke up that morning in an itchy cot I didn't recognize, with no memory of leaving home at all. I looked around at the room I was in, the walls were solid concrete, with occasional chipping and blood stains. The room smelt of mold, and was slightly damp. Across the room from me was another cot, although it was empty, there were tally marks on the wall next to it. I came to the conclusion that I'd be sharing this room with someone for the foreseeable future when the large metal door on the far side of the room suddenly burst open.

 Before I could even comprehend what had happened I was thrown off of my cot and dragged through a narrow corridor by an armed man.

“Who-who are you?! Where am I?!” 

The words had barely left my mouth before he slammed my face against the wall and dragged me that way for the rest of the trip. When the man finally released his grip on me, I fell onto hard, bloodstained dirt. Was I outside? The hope that had surged through me was quickly diminished when I looked at my surroundings, it was a large, rectangular room.

As I looked up I realized that the room had no roof, the top of the wall was met with what looked like stands from a sports stadium. From what I could see, every seat was filled. My attention was ripped from the audience by the sound of a door slamming on the other side of the room. I looked over and found myself making direct eye contact with another kid. He looked to be the same age as me with shaggy brown hair, he looked just as scared and confused as I'm sure I did. My train of thought was broken by a shrill voice crackling through an intercom,

“All bets are now closed, and as always, all luck to the highest bidder”

The speaker cut out with a hiss, replaced by the deep clang of a bell echoing through the arena. I turned to the boy— and caught a fist to the side of my face.
