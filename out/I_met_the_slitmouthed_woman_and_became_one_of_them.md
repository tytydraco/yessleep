I thought Kuchisake-onna was just a Japanese urban legend.   
 A ghost story. A meme. 

Last night, walking home from work, I saw her. She was under a flickering streetlight, tall, long black hair covering half her face. Beige coat. White surgical mask. 

As I passed, she looked at me intensely and said: 

“Am I pretty?” 

I said yes, because what else do you say? 

Then she took off the mask. Her mouth was split ear to ear, teeth like broken glass. She asked again: 

“Even like this?” 

I panicked and said, “You’re… average.”   
 Her head twitched like a broken puppet. 

I ran. I don’t remember how I got home. 

This morning, three deep gouges were carved into my front door. Like giant scissors. 

I don’t think she’s done with me. 

Update 

I didn’t sleep last night. 

Every time I closed my eyes, I heard it: snip… snip… snip. Like scissors being opened and closed. It would stop when I turned on the light, but start again when I tried to lie down. 

At 3:14 a.m. my phone buzzed. An unknown number sent me a single photo: my apartment door, from the outside. The three gouges were deeper. 

I looked through the peephole. Nothing but an empty hallway. 

But when I turned away, I heard a soft voice right behind it: 

“Am I pretty?” 

I didn’t open the door. I haven't slept since. 

It’s worse. 

I left for work this morning and noticed something on my apartment door: a piece of paper taped to it. It said, in neat handwriting: 

EVEN LIKE THIS? 

No one in my building saw who left it. 

All day at work, I heard faint scissors. My coworkers didn’t hear a thing. 

On my way home tonight, she followed me. I saw her reflection in shop windows. She’s faster now. 

When I got back, my bathroom mirror was cracked. The words “AM I PRETTY?” scratched into the glass from the inside. 

I think she’s in my apartment. 

I tried burning sage. I tried praying. I even left an offering at the crossroads like some forums suggested. 

Nothing worked. 

At 2:59 a.m. tonight, my bedroom door creaked open by itself. I smelled iron—blood. I heard the scissors again, closer than ever. 

Then a whisper: 

“You can’t run forever.” 

I grabbed my phone and hid in the closet. I’m typing this from there right now. The scissors are right outside the door. Snip. Snip. Snip. I heard the scissors getting louder and louder. 

If she asks again, what do I say? If anyone knows, please tell me, i said out loud. 

I tried answering her. 

She whispered, “Am I pretty?”   
 I whispered back, “You’re beautiful.” 

She opened the door. 

I can’t see her face anymore. Everything is dark. My mouth burns. It feels… open. Too open. 

She’s whispering to me now. She says I’m hers. She says I’ll be pretty soon. 

If you see her, don’t answer. Don’t look. Don’t smile. Dont give any reaction. 

Because if you do, you’ll end up like me.
