Max was always so cute- the sight of him could brighten your day as a whole.

I adopted him from a shelter 7 years back- fond memories- and we’ve been besties ever since.

When my daughter and wife separated from me, he was the only one that stood by me through and through.

 

I was laying on my bed one Sunday afternoon. Couldn’t sleep. The crickets woke me up that day. I had just finished scrolling on reddit, reading some of the messed up things that happened that day. Frankly I hated everything about my life by then. My wife, may and I had a good run together.  In a way I always thought that she would be loyal. I never expected that she would cheat on me and my entire world would be turned upside down in a flash.

 

I remembered the day we brought him home- we had just brought him 2 days after our marriage- we were so happy back then. She loved dogs so much. Hers passed away days before the marriage, she was so sad. She even started to rethink and expressed her wish to postpone the wedding. I supported her decision, whatever it was but in the end she agreed that it was stupid and she would not let this ruin our big day.

 

She was so happy when I showed her the puppy- a cute Labrador- that she almost cried tears of happiness. When we hugged, all three of us, I wished that particular moment would never end. I wished we would all be together. That everything would be fine.

 

But it wasn’t.

 

Max was a lasting representation of our love that we- or at least I had for her, and which I thought she had for me.

 

i awoke from the bed rather quickly, making up my mind. Max was startled all the same, but he groggily woke up. I took him by my arms and went over to my truck parked in the driveway, taking some lone star beer out of the fridge and placing max in the back seat. When I went over to the truck clutching some four or five beer bottles in my hands, I glanced and saw that max had moved from the back seat to the seat near to the driver’s seat.

Starting the truck, I set off.

 

I didn’t know where the hell I was going, or even if I knew where I was at the moment- but little did I know I would soon regret this decision of a last minute drive.

Max was always understanding. Hell, maybe he was even more understanding than my wife. He had sensed something was wrong ever since she took our 7 year old daughter and son and stormed out. He never barked. Never made any noise. He just came close to me and proceeded to climb onto my lap. He set his little head on my resting arm, and closed his eyes. I will never forget that.

 

I thought I would stop the car somewhere in a lone corner of the road or something- and drink the rest of the beers there and kinda crash in the truck itself.

And I found a lone spot near a forest.

I parked the truck on the side of the road, and started to empty the beers while thinking about the hell I was living in. I really needed some peace.

I opened the truck doors to go out and have some peace and walk max through the side of the road.

 

I leashed him and let him out. Walking beside him through the forest, I felt a sense of- dread? Elude me. Weird.

 

Near me I thought I heard a small rustling of leaves of twigs- but I really did not mind the least. All I cared was for me to relive everything that-

Crunch.

I turned back, clearly max was noticing something as well.

He stared at a dark clearing at the same spot for many a time now. He started barking. I’ve never heard him bark for a long time, so I was kind of caught off guard.

 

He had his limbs scrunched up and he looked like he was ready to pounce.

I held his leash rather tightly because I did not want him to-

But no. He was tugging harder at the leash. Harder and harder until my hands hurt.

‘Fuck!-’

And max was off.

I ran after him , and fuck me, I forgot to take a flashlight or even my cellphone with me. I was surrounded by dark.

I couldn’t see anything, let alone look for him, and it didn’t matter because I blacked out for some reason seconds later.

 

When I  awoke the clearing was empty. The trees making way swayed ominously. Thank god I was not too deep into the forest but fuck that- I was gonna go search for max.

But where would I start?

I got into my truck and gathered people from the neighborhood. Many were asking me why I would drag him into a forest late at night and frankly, I had nothing to tell them.

I was fucking helpless.

 

So a small amount of my neighbors who I called to search for max began their work from the clearing- surely we couldn’t search the whole forest anyway.

After 2 days of searching, going back and forth from the clearing to going deeper, many gradually gave up and stopped searching for max. Many stayed to show their sympathy for what happened with my wife. I made it clear I wanted none of that.

After 3 days almost all of my neighborhood gave up. I was searching lifelessly through the forest.

I got into my truck and left that clearing.

 

I cried through the whole ride home.

First my wife and kids- now my dog.

Why god?

Why?

 

I got back from work tomorrow morning, closed the door and slumped onto the couch with a beer bottle. I turned the television on.

I frankly did not care whatever the television was showing- I just wanted to take my mind off things.

After what seemed like hours of constant staring at the large big box that was the television, my eyes drooping to the size of almost a miniscule ant-

I heard it.

A bark.

 

I lept from my couch, almost twisting my ankle- I ventured out into the open in my slippers. Looking farther into the backyard, I could see the outline of a dog.

My heart almost leapt with joy.

I ran to the dog- and thank god I thought to take a torch with me, shined the light onto the dog.

It was max.

Running up to him and holding him tighter than ever before, I clutched him close to me. I brought him home, called everyone I knew and told them the good news. I locked all the doors and windows just in case he wanted to jump out again- I was calling my best friend and telling him the good news when I noticed something.

He was cold.

Pale cold.

I mean, I thought he was that cold because he was exposed to the harsh winter in alaska-  but even after bathing him in lukewarm water and washing him off with a blowdryer and towel, he was cold.

Like that of a metal.

You know how, when you walk into a bathroom in the morning and turn on a tap, you suddenly yank your hand because it is that cold?

His whole body felt that way.

But ever since I got him, there’s been this dread within me.

I don’t know why.

I know I should be happy, I got him back after a long three days and I should pamper him as much as I can- but, I don’t know how to explain it-

He just didn’t feel like my dog.

that’s when I started noticing the small things.

 

His blue leash- which said max in a blue-frame encased locket, looked like it was teared off.

There were bite marks on the edges.

And on some sides, I even noticed some pale red substance- and christ I do not want to know whatever the fuck that is..

 

Maybe he got in a fight with some wild animal, right? Yeah, yeah that must be it.

 

But that isn’t the thing.

Me and max would binge watch movies and all kinds of television shows, and we would hug each other all through it.

So I put on a season of friends and I went to get him.

And while I approached him- he retreated.

Like he didn’t know who I was.

It was intentional- he yanked his limb right from me. And he looked into my eyes with an intentional stare.

He wanted me to know something.

I was caught off guard by this- this feeling of dread and fear increased in me, I don’t know who the fuck I should explain it. I just can’t.

 

I walked very slowly to the couch, and ‘max’- was still maintaining eye contact with me. It looked at me, tracked my body as I sat and looked away from him, turning on the first episode.

The motherfucker was staring at me through the whole thing.

It did not move a limb.

It kept staring.

By this point I knew something was wrong and whatever the fuck this dog was, it was not max.

 

Going into my room and making my bed, I turned back to ‘max’ staring at me again.

His movement were calculated; controlled. Almost as a predator that did not want to lose sight of it’s prey; or a predator that wanted to remain hidden of sorts.

From then on I hated every second I was with him.

The next morning I woke to find him asleep, or at least that’s what he appeared to be doing- and I put the tray on the counter. I shaked his container for a few seconds.

He didn’t come.

Usually max would sprint across the room if he heard any sign of a container shaking- but, nothing now.

I emptied some of the food onto the tray and placed it onto the floor.

 

‘Max! Come on boy!’ I yelled.

Still nothing.

I went to the room in which  he was asleep only to find the motherfucker staring back at me.

Staring into my fucking soul.

I put the tray beneath him and left for work 2 hours earlier than I was supposed to.

After work, sunset was nearing. I drove slowly. I didn’t want to be closer to that thing, whatever it was.

Returning home, I decided to take the route I took that night.

 

Passing through the forest, I stopped the truck at the same clearing and began to search.

I didn’t know if I was going to find him. Maybe the real max was back home… but no.

There was something.. ominous about it.

Suddenly, my nose was attacked by a rude stench.

It crawled through my nostrils and I coughed all throughout the ordeal.

Making my way through the stench, I focused onto the thing laying on the ground.

 

Holy shit. Holy shit holy shit,

Max.

His leash was ripped off, maggots were crawling all throughout his body, encasing his once loved abode.

I’m scared to go back home now as I’m writing this. I buried him in that same clearing.

I just have one question.

What the fuck is in my house if max is dead?
