It was exactly 8 PM when the church bells rang.

  


My fiance, Summer, and I walked along the sidewalk bordering our apartment complex. The nights air was cool, but not overly so, the years first snow was surely still beyond the horizon. Small piles of orange and browning leaves littered the sidewalk and filled a nearby ditch. 

  


We walked to the end of the sidewalk into the town square, a small thing with lots of ash trees and a tall, white pergola sitting in the very middle. The square also housed a statue of Oakfields founder and a monument dedicated to previous townsfolk who had served in World War II. If you hadn’t guessed already, there wasn’t much to Oakfield. The combines kicking up a plume of dust in their wake was the biggest event going on at this time of year. 

  


‘Watch out for our farmers!’, signs were posted everywhere. 

  


We arrived at the pergola and sat on its steps, craning our necks up toward the cloudless sky. Summer and I were the type to stay in after we’d both arrived home from work, opting for a good scary movie instead of messing around outside. Tonight, however, the northern lights were out in full force, casting a ghoulish green over the sky. If you looked closely enough, you could see streaks of velvet swimming in its swampish hue. 

  


“Can you see the red?”, I asked, pointing uselessly into the heavens above, “you gotta’ like, look deep into it”. Summer had her phone out, snapping dozens of pictures of the dancing sky. 

  


“Check this out!”, she exclaimed, turning the phone towards me. The red hues in the sky were much more pronounced in the pictures she had taken. I studied the picture she’d taken, it was beautiful, showing all the shops and the square underneath a beautiful skyline. It looked like something you’d see on a postcard or a magazine.

  


Before I returned my gaze to the stars, I noticed something odd in the picture she had taken. Between the cafe and the post office was a shadow, tall and slim, nearly imperceptible if you weren’t looking directly at it. But the longer I looked at it, I could make out a pair of arms and legs and a masked face looking directly at the camera. 

  


I turned my eyes from the phone to that alleyway. My heart sank.

  
  


A perfect light from a nearby post hung over the spot where the figure had stood, revealing nothing standing there at all. My anxiety must’ve been palpable as Summer prodded me about why I had become so quiet. After explaining what I had seen and having her examine the picture and the actual alleyway, I could sense a similar shift in her mood. 

  


“Yeah, thats kinda’ spooky”, she finally said, “you wanna head inside?”

  


We took one last look at the sky, and one last look at the empty alleyway, before making the long walk back to our apartment. The shifting air felt particularly cold on that walk back, every step sent a chill down my spine as the orange leaves shattered beneath our feet.

  


“We probably look like idiots”, Summer laughed, pushing my shoulder lightly. I smiled, happy that she’d broken up the quiet tension which had built up. My eyes had adjusted to the outside and everything around us didn’t seem quite so dark, which also helped ease my anxiety.

  


Rather than sinking this time, my heart practically fell out of my ass as we neared the front door of the complex. Walking along the sidewalk on the opposite side of the road was a tall, slim figure dressed in an odd outfit. Its eyes were glued to us. 

  


The man wore a straw hat, casting a shadow over his gaunt face. His face was smeared with paint that made him resemble something like a scarecrow. I’m not sure if it was just his costume but I swear his eyes seemed to be as black as buttons. He wore a huge, tattered flannel that hung and fluttered in the wind, a similarly dirty pair of blue jeans hung loosely off him as well. 

  


As we stopped, only the sound of our panicked breaths breaking the silent Autumn air, he did too. Watching us, studying us. 

  


Finally, he raised a gloved hand and waved, continuing on his unknown journey. He whistled a  disjointed tune with no particular rhythm as he continued along the sidewalk before finally disappearing into another alleyway. 

  


We hurried up inside shortly thereafter. 

  


Sleep was elusive that night as we both tossed and turned, shooting up and looking into the dark hallway of our studio apartment anytime there was a noise. Even though we’d locked all the windows, I wasn’t terribly confident in their ability to keep out an intruder. 

  


We rose early the next morning, both conveniently forgetting to bring up the weird shit we had seen the previous night. However, I noticed Summer had deleted all the pictures she’d taken from that night. 

  


Before work we’d decided to get some breakfast at the local cafe, hoping that a little food would clear up any lasting illness that odd encounter had brought us. 

  


“Y’know, Halloweens coming up…”, I began as we rounded the corner of the square and made our way towards the cafe, “I’m sure it was just some weird dude trying to fuck with us”, I finished, hardly satisfied with my half assed explanation.

  


“Yeah but it’s not like it was a kid”, Summer chewed at her nail, never making eye contact with me, “that dude looked like he was eight feet tall”

  


A small group of townsfolk were gathered outside the cafe, gathered right in front of the alleyway between it and the post office. Some were trying to snap photos of whatever the police chief and various firemen were attempting to blockade, though the yellow ribbon dividing them seemed hardly capable. Some of the others seemed only to stare in disbelief. 

  


‘CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS’, the yellow tape prominently read. 

  


I swung my arm over Summers shoulder and directed us into the cafe, trying to avoid whatever it was that had caused such a scene. 

  


Whatever hopes I’d had for a normal day were shattered quickly after Cory, the cook at the Uptown Cafe, came out to take our order. During my short time as a line cook at the cafe, I’d learned that Cory was never one to mince words. 

  


“You hear about that shit, Clay?”, he asked, his usual stoner-sunken eyes now as sharp as an eagle. I shook my head no. 



“Some sick bastard nailed a bunch of stray cats to the walls”, he said, a slight grin turning his lips, “that ain’t gonna’ be good for business”, he pulled out a book of guest checks and waited for us to order as if we’d still be hungry. 

  


“What the hell do you mean?”, I finally stammered out. He returned his gaze to me, looking at me as if I was dumb. 

  


“Well, it means he took some hammer and nails, and created the Oakfield Louvre right in my alleyway”, he replied sarcastically, “What’re ya’ll having to eat”, he asked impatiently as the diner began filling with dazed looking customers. 

  


“No, look, I mean who did that shit?”, I spat back, remembering why I quit working at the cafe in the first place. 

  


Cory stuck the pen behind his ear and sighed impatiently, “Ain’t got any details yet, but apparently the guy wrote Corny the Clown in blood…”, he paused, seeming to decide whether or not to spill the rest of the details, “apparently the blood he used to write with wasn’t from one of them strays, either”.
