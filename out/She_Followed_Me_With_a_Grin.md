I’m writing this on my laptop in my apartment, and I don’t know what else to do.

I want to call the police, but I already know what they’d say. I think I’m crazy. I keep telling myself that. But if I don’t write this down, I feel like I’m going to lose whatever grip I still have on what’s real.

If anyone reads this… please. Tell me what I’m supposed to do.

A few hours ago, I stopped at the grocery store after work. It was Friday night, around nine. I was tired and just wanted to get home. The store was quiet, the kind of quiet you only get late at night when the aisles echo and the music sounds too loud.

I grabbed a cart and wandered through the store, picking up the usual things—milk, eggs, bread, cheese. I didn’t have a list. I just walked in a lazy loop, letting muscle memory guide me.

That’s when I saw her the first time.

She was at the end of one aisle, turned away from me. Red puffy jacket. Black leggings. Ugg boots. She looked… normal. Almost painfully normal. For a split second, I thought about saying hi. I hadn’t dated in a long time, and my brain did that stupid thing where it imagines a whole interaction that never happens.

I shook my head and kept walking. I didn’t want to be that guy.

A few aisles later, I saw her again.

This time she was facing a shelf, standing close to it like she was reading labels. I noticed something then that didn’t quite register until later—she didn’t have a cart. No basket. No items in her hands.

Still, I told myself it was coincidence. Big store. People cross paths.

But then I passed her a third time.

She hadn’t moved much at all.

Her feet were planted in the same place. Her body was perfectly still. No sway. No shift. No subtle rise and fall of her shoulders like someone breathing.

I felt my stomach tighten.

“God, I’m a creep,” I muttered out loud.

That’s when I walked my cart straight into a display and sent plastic kitchen gadgets scattering across the floor. I dropped down to clean it up, my face burning with embarrassment.

I reached under my cart for one last piece.

That’s when I saw the boots.

Ugg boots.

Pointed directly at me.

I stood up slowly.

She was in the middle of the aisle, facing me. Completely still. Her posture was stiff, like someone had posed her and forgotten to finish the job.

Her eyes were wide. Too wide. Looking at them made my own eyes ache, like I was trying to hold a stare too long.

And her mouth…

It was smiling. But not in a friendly way. It was stretched into a grin that felt wrong, like it was pulling her face apart. It wasn’t joyful. It wasn’t angry. It was… knowing.

It felt heavy. Like it was pressing down on me.

I backed up and pushed my cart away. I didn’t run. I just moved fast. Her face stayed burned into my vision even when I wasn’t looking at her anymore.

I rushed to checkout and startled the cashier, an older woman slumped over her register. She snapped at me for scaring her.

I apologized and started unloading my items, glancing down the aisles.

She was at the far end of one of them.

Still smiling.

“Are you okay?” the cashier asked.

“Yeah,” I said. My voice didn’t sound like mine.

I looked again.

She was closer.

A man behind me barked, “Are you going to pay or what? Some of us want to get home.”

“It’s just… that girl,” I muttered.

“What girl?” he snapped.

I pointed down the aisle.

They both looked.

“There’s nobody there, jack. You crazy?”

I looked past him.

She was standing directly behind him.

I screamed and fell backward.

Her mouth was wider now. Her eyes were locked on mine. And it felt different—like before she’d just been there, but now… now she was focused on me.

The cashier and the man moved toward me cautiously.

“What the hell is wrong with you?” the man yelled.

I didn’t answer. I ran.

I didn’t take my groceries. I ran all the way to my car and slammed the door. My chest hurt from how hard I was breathing.

When I looked up, I saw a red shape near the store entrance.

She was standing in the light.

I drove home as fast as I could. Every stoplight felt like it lasted forever. I kept checking my mirrors. Every reflection looked wrong.

I told myself walls would protect me. A door. A lock. Something solid.

I parked and sat there with my eyes closed.

Then I checked the rearview mirror.

She was in my back seat.

Her face looked older now. Rotten. Her teeth were dark and broken—too many of them. Her lips were cracked and bleeding.

Her eyes were still wide.

Black fluid ran down her cheeks.

I ran.

I tripped on the stairs. I fumbled my keys. I slammed the door behind me and stood there listening.

Silence.

No knocking. No footsteps.

Relief hit me so hard I laughed.

It was just stress. Fatigue. A panic attack.

Then my stomach dropped.

Something was at my door.

I felt myself moving toward it. I didn’t want to, but my feet went anyway.

I leaned into the peephole.

She was there.

Her eyes were bleeding. Black liquid streamed down her face. Her grin stretched wider when she saw me looking.

I ran to my bedroom, locked the door, shoved my dresser in front of it, and locked my windows.

Now I’m sitting on my bed with my laptop.

If you’re reading this… please.

What do I do?
