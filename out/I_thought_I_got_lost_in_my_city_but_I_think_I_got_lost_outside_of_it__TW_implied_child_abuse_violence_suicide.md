Many people ask me why I love Berlin so much. And they rarely understand my answer: It's the way the city is alive.

For one, Berlin is a pretty green city, you know? Even many of the big and busy streets are lined with trees, and pools of green parks sprawl out amidst the buildings. Sometimes the life seems ugly - like the rats teeming across subway tracks or pigeons shitting from a bus stop's roof. But I am in love with it when the foxes scream at night and the cats howl during their hunts and fights. It makes me smile when the starlings and sparrows hop around me as I sit down on a bench, eagerly beeping to beg for food, and I happily tug some bits off my sandwich to toss among them.

But I think my favorite may be the crows. Even as a child, I found it hypnotising when their murders swarmed across the skies. It always felt like I could almost, *almost* recognise something in the shapes or their flight. Something significant. Something magical.

I own no pets, but I buy cat treats every day. The good ones, too. All so I can seize the opportunities when the crows land on the lamp posts around me, tilting their heads so that their eyes, little black pearls among their feathers, can get a better look at me.

I like to step back a little then, get out the treat bags, and throw a few.
"Treats!" I offer in a high pitched voice.

And without fail, a few brave crows flutter down to peck at my little offerings. It's a delight, really! Watching them hop around, gathering the little morsels. They seem so thankful, and so am I!

"Good birdies~!" I coo, squatting down as I toss more and more food to them. It almost hurts my heart when the bags are empty and I have to announce it with a sad "All gone! All gone!" to my feathery friends.

At first, that was when they took off again. No doubt to bring any surplus to their families and stashes for later. It always left me feeling a bit sad and empty to be abandoned so soon.

But now, this doesn't deter them anymore. They often still hop after me a little, cawing and fluttering at me. It makes me laugh and I always answer them like it's a conversation. I like the idea that they are telling me about their day.

My favorite are a pair I like to call Huginn and Muninn. Yes, yes, those are actually ravens - so sue me.

Huginn and Muninn are the bravest among their murder. They happily come so close that I could touch them if I really wanted to. I never do though - I don't know if they'd be fine with it and you know, wild animals are still wild animals. The crows and I, we appreciate each other. But I am aware that there is an invisible border between me, a human, and the wildlife of Berlin. The crows are not pets, they are not for petting.

I cross the border to bring them food. And they welcome me on their side as a respectful guest. But eventually, I have a duty to leave again and return to my apartment, to the domestic world within the buildings.

And that's okay. My love is not arrogant. I don't feel entitled to the hearts of crows.

It makes me all the more excited and happy when those two come so close, sometimes even ignoring the treats to gently caw at me. Their brethren are grey like the cloudy, misty days of autumn, safe for their black heads and wings. But Huginn and Muninn are black like the light-polluted sky at night.

For all the love I have for my surroundings, I don't have much for myself. My body, at times, feels unfitting like a suit in the wrong size. But many of my insecurities melt away when the crows look at me and I realize that in their eyes, I am no more or less unsightly than any other human. It's nice.

I think the reason many people don't understand this is because to them, I'm not even remotely as social and open as I am towards the animals and plants. That's okay though. They don't need to understand as long as they are nice to me, which most of them are. I don't really have many friends, but I am treated cordially by my co-workers at the grocery store, and even by most of the customers. That's all I need. They even let me take the late shifts I prefer!

My workplace tends to be open until 11pm, which means that we typically wrap up all end-of-day stuff around midnight. So I have a whole hour of counting and tidying to get excited for my evening routine! And then I grab the treats I bought on my break and get to wander home through the nightly streets, while the city is dozing. Sometimes I take the night bus, but construction sites have a habit of popping up along my route like mushrooms. And I'm not always in the mood for the long detours or additional stops to switch busses. Especially when walking through the nightly city is so wonderful.

It never fully falls asleep, but on work nights it can get quiet enough for the cats and foxes to come out. I beam whenever I see one of them dart across a silent street in front of me, and sometimes they even stop and look at me! It's strange how in those late hours, when the world is streetlightorange and nightblack, the city feels the most alive to me. I sometimes almost think I can feel it breathe beneath my feet, its chest rising and falling ever so slowly as it dreams of faraway ambulance sirens and the occasional laughter from a dark window.

So when I walk home one autumn night and hear nothing, it gives me pause. My steps slow until I stand still, cocking my head to listen.

There is no distant rumble of cars and trains tonight. No fox screams, no cat hisses. As I raise my eyes and look around, all windows are dark, the only light around coming from the street lamps. They do not buzz as they usually do, and no moths dance around them.

I shudder and pull my hoodie closer around me. But there is no wind. The trees and shrubs of my street are still, each leaf perfectly motionless. I can't help but imagine them holding their breath to escape the notice of something.

When I hear the murder caw, it makes me wince at first. But I feel relief spreading through my chest when I see the crows flutter down onto the branches and streetlamps around me. They are familiar faces, and the suffocating isolation I felt a moment ago is easily broken by the flutter of their wings. I don't even think about the unusual time for their outing as I excitedly dig in my messenger bag and produce the little strips of meat I bought for them today.

"Treats!" I offer, happily ripping open the bag. The rustle of the plastic feels strangely loud in the night, as does my voice. But I am too happy still - I pull out some meat bits and toss them onto the sidewalk for my friends.

For some reason, it seems to unsettle the crows. Some of them caw at me, strangely muted tonight. Huginn and Muninn flutter down to the roof of a parked car and motion at me with their wings and head. I am deeply confused that they ignore the food so completely.

"What's wrong? Treats!" I say, throwing some more strips of meat their way. At first I smile when one of them flies off the car - but then I notice with horror that he doesn't aim for the treats on the pavement, but for me.

I yelp as Muninn swishes past me so closely that I can feel his claws cut the air above my head. And I stumble back a few steps, dropping the bag and trembling as my brain tries to process the profound betrayal. I thought we were… well, not friends, maybe. Friends are a domestic thing.

But I thought I was a welcome guest. And now, instead, each caw and flutter makes me feel like I am unwanted here.

I don't have much time to dwell on this, because the noise around me abruptly ceases and all bird heads turn so their beaks point at the same point somewhere above us. A discordant scratching sound is all that remains, and I feel as if someone is slowly trickling ice water down my nape as I, too, turn to face the noise.

A black, needle-like limb slowly creeps around the corner of a building, on the height of the third floor just about. As it somehow finds purchase on the vertical surface, it is followed by a white face slowly emerging from behind the wall. Hair like black, tattered spiderwebbing drifts on a nonexistant breeze, long and sheer. The face looks serene, asleep, with closed eyes and a slight smile.

I am frozen in place at the sight, and the gears of my mind slowly tick into position to grant me some understanding.

I am at home in the domestic world. I am a welcome guest in the wild world.

*This creature belongs to neither.*

Abruptly, the Thing scuttles towards us. Faster than a thought, its five other limbs join the first one - all of them spindly, ending in points sharp enough to split the bricks of the building as it darts over. I can't gasp as fast as it is in front of me, and bigger than it should be. It was barely as tall as a window up on the building, but in its swift motion, perspective seemed to crack and bend, and it grew taller faster than it grew closer somehow. As the murder dissolves around me, the crows taking flight with alarmed cries, the creature stops short about two meters from me and tilts its head.

For a moment I consider running, but my instincts root me to the ground. They understand faster than the rest of me that I can't outrun something this quick - and more importantly, that running is a very prey thing to do. So I keep my breathing quiet and shallow as I slowly move my hands to my messenger bag, gripping it tightly in case I need a shield of sorts.

The creature seems to regard me through its closed eyes, its face slowly creeping closer. My brain tries and struggles to perceive its body - I can discern the spidery legs and the webbish hair, but the rest is difficult to ascertain. It's all so black that I can see it as little more than a silhouette in the night, no highlights and shadows carve out the volume for me to grasp. There is the notion that there is a neck, as it slowly elongates to bring the face closer to mine, and there is the notion that there is a body, because there must be to connect it all. But that is all I can even say with certainty, and my eyes are soon too focused on the creature's face to even pay much attention to the rest.

The face seems like a mask, perfectly expressionless except for the slightly upturned corners of the mouth. It seems made in the image of a beautiful woman at first, with full lips and a dainty nose. But as it stops so close that its nose almost touches my own, I register with horror that I am staring at my own features, without being able to pinpoint when the change took place.

We stand like this while some seconds flow by as slowly as molasses. My heart hurts as it pumps my blood so hard that the rushing in my veins rings in my ears like static, even nearly drowning out the calls of the crows above. And then my humanity emerges from the deepest depths of me, and my brain short circuits from all the stress, picking out the most mundane and unimportant thing it could possibly wonder about to suppress the fear I feel.

One of my hands slowly rises, almost without my consent, to answer the question that suddenly occupies my mind. A few trembling fingertips touch the mask in front of me, brushing against it lightly.

Huh. Yeah. It's made of porcelain.

The hard china shifts in an instant from the soft smile to a wide grin and the creature's eyes snap open. Cold blue doll eyes roll around in the mask's sockets before they settle on me, and the grin widens and widens until it by all means should split the face - my face - in two.

I pull back my hand and stare wide-eyed as the creature tilts its face up, up, up, never breaking eye contact with me. And then I hear a tearing, moist and horrid, and I finally look down to see that the neck is *not* moving. The mask is tearing away from it, the chin splitting and ripping open along the seams of the jaw, behind which yawns an abyss much too bottomless for even this being. I stumble back a step as it bares its teeth, which are needles and serrated blades and barbs, and a glistening rope snakes past them to split into dripping tendrils before me.

Somehow I manage to hold the messenger bag up and slip out of the carrying strap just as the tentacles shoot forth and grab it, tearing it away from me and into the nightmare. A high pitched whimper squeezes from my throat when I hear a hissing sound and watch as the bountiful saliva of the monster dissolves the bag and its contents even while it gets shredded by the many teeth.

It reminds me that I have one last tool to use for such situations.

"HELP!!" I scream. And then I remember how you're supposed to do it.

"F-FIRE! FIRE! HELP!" I can't completely recall why, but I vaguely remember the recommendation. The fact that calling out about fire at least makes people look. Often even call 112, the firefighters and ambulance. And from the corner of my eye, I register motion in one of the dark windows around me.

I allow myself to tear my gaze away from the creature long enough to see who heard me, and my eyes just meet another smiling porcelain face behind one of the window panes. My blood freezes in my veins as from the darkness behind the glass, more white faces emerge - one behind each window, un-staring at me and their ilk. I can't help but turn my head entirely to it as the first window opens and another one of the creatures crawls out, an ethereal cackle filling the air and gaining layers as more windows open up.

I feel utterly hopeless and slowly turn back to the first monster. It shakes with a cackle of its own, eyes rolling in different directions. As it makes another lunge at me though, it is hit by something from above and the cackle becomes a brief, shrill shriek.

My eyes snap up to the crows. They are cawing their little souls out, but by now, that isn't all they do anymore. I see them dive down to pick up anything their claws can grasp - rocks, empty cans, sometimes even just grass or soil - and they let their burdens rain down on the monster in front of me. Some of them swoop at the other creatures, sharp beaks razing off bits of the tattered veils around their faces. My heart overflows with gratitude and fondness for them until it wells up in my eyes and streaks down my cheeks.

Perhaps I can run. Perhaps I can hide. Perhaps I can return to my domestic world after all!

I try to turn to make a run for my building, but before I have even finished the full spin, a searing pain shoots through me. It radiates up from my foot as I hit the ground hard. I look down to see that the creature was not too distracted to notice my attempt - it pierced my foot with one of its limbs, pinning me against the ground. I cry out as it pulls me closer even while it fends off the crows and their improvised projectiles. Around me, the limbs of other creatures scratch down the walls. I look up into the flying murder, regretting that I still don't understand what I can almost, *almost* read in the shape of their flight.

And then, behind the creature above me… the moon blinks.

I fall silent once more as something shifts. The scream of a fox tears through the night and the feet of rats skitter past us somewhere. I watch as a moth whirls through my vision and I feel the city take a deep, shuddering breath.

The moon shifts, and it is an eye, and the night turns to look at us. As it lowers its head, I can discern the shape of short, squareish ears and a broad head upon which sits a crown of red bricks. At its top, trees sprout from the wall, their leaves rustling in a wind that suddenly picked up.

Berlin looks at us, fixing the creatures with her eyes, one the moon and one a pool of street- and headlights, ever shifting. I feel a rumble shaking the earth as the giant bear above us growls and the creatures turn their pale faces to it. The night parts lips of orange clouds and a fiery red tongue lolls out of the titanic maw, steel teeth bared around it. She roars, and it's the screams of foxes and the howl of car horns and the noises of catfights and the scream of train wheels against their tracks as they brake. Lost children cry in her throat, and drunk men laugh, and the teeth of creatures with glowing eyes are dipped in the same scarlet as the knives of shadowy figures.

The monsters turn to flee, but the City tears an asphalt paw out of the road and swipes at them almost lazily. Red claws the length of street blocks pierce and collect several of the spindly beings - including the one in front of me - and throw them into the gaping maw of Berlin. They shriek pathetically as she bites down and their bodies crunch, and I can't help but think they're lucky. I know that in those depths they're headed for, there are worse things than teeth and claws. I glimpsed them when the mouth was open, saw, for a moment, the things in the deep. There was the cold of the winter streets and the fear of blue lights, the hostility of benches engineered to steal your sleep, the hopelessness of letters denying your basic necessities. The helplessness of neglectful guardians, the dehumanization of a stranger screaming at you. There were the shock of driving a train when someone steps on the tracks and looking out an office window as a body drops past, followed by a chilling wet thud soon after. Horrors surely as alien to these creatures as their ropey tendrils were to me.

The murder descends onto me, still cawing madly as they land all around and on my body. Huginn and Muninn sit on my chest, staring at my face and blinking. Huginn acts as if he pecks at me first and then Muninn and the others follow suit.

I weirdly understand and close my eyes, going limp and playing dead. The crows make a big show of seemingly pecking at me, tugging at my clothing here and there and spreading their wings to block the City's view of me. I feel it shift as it leans in for a sniff that lifts me off the asphalt for a heartstopping moment with its strength. But the crows immediately flutter up with a courage I will forever aspire to, offendedly cawing at the titan bear. Berlin huffs, blowing my limp body several meters down the road with the force and moves to instead pursue the creatures to which I was as easy a snack as they are to the City.

I crack my eyes open a little to watch as it passes overhead, glittering with the lights of streetlamps and windows at night. The laughter and music of faraway parties brushes past me, the rustling of leaves in the night and drunk singing and meows of graveyard cats. The suffocating heat of urban summers and the chill of winter nights take turns with the mild air of springs. I hear the Spree gurgle and feel immersed in its waters, fish flitting past me, and then I feel the calm of public transport after midnight on a weekend, with tired people smiling as they head home. I smell smog and dust and excrements and blood and fresh bread rolls and flowers and wet paint and dogs.

And then the Goddess has moved on and we are alone, the crows and I, my mind reeling from having seen and felt all my home is.

It takes Muninn actually pecking at my cheek for me to come back from my trance and I give him a bleary blink. His beak opens, but this time not to caw.

"Good birdies!" He coos in a voice close to mine. Huginn joins in.
"Good birdies! Good birdies! Treats?" They hop off my chest and their brethren get off me as well, fluttering and cawing with the occasional praise for themselves thrown in.

A laugh bubbles up from deep within me, and as I throw back my head and it spills from my lips, I could swear that I can also hear the hum of cars and the rustle of leaves in it somewhere.

"Good birdies!" I affirm and get up. It will probably be best for me to get home and sleep it off. My foot hurts, but that worldly sensation is so distant right now, while the exhaustion is so present and overwhelming.

As I limp towards my building, drawing keys from my pocket, I have to dodge wires growing up from the ground around the piece of road which Berlin's claws raked deep rifts into. I pause to watch as the broken street scabs over with a construction site. I know from the depths of my stomach that tomorrow, construction workers will show up and do their job here just as casually and naturally as everywhere else in the city. As I turn away from it, I smile about the insight I feel enlightened with.

I am hurting. I am bleeding. I am freezing. I am tired.

But I am alive.

Just like the city.
