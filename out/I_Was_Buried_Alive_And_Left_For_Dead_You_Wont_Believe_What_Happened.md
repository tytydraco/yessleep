I grew up in a small town, was well liked by everyone. Played sports, had good grades, no issues with law enforcement. Everything was great. Until after I graduated. I was 18 when it happened and I wasn’t charged with the crime, but I was looked at like a murderer because I was the last one seen with the missing Williams boy. 

They were a bigger family in the little city of Stanford, Seth Williams was the youngest of 4 brothers, same age as I and was a good friend of mine. We went camping in the mountains after graduation a group of 4 of us and 3 only made it back. All I can recall because of heavy drinking is we all turned in for the night, and when we got up Seth was gone. 

We all believed he just went home early or something never thinking anything of it. Until a few days passed and a missing persons report was filed. A search and rescue team combed the mountains for 5 days covering from our campsite a 30 mile radius all around and Seth was never discovered. 

The family all blamed me, and hated me for it, so much so I felt like my life was threatened, so I made arrangements to move outta town, as I was attending college 300 miles away anyway. The Williams boys made threats and they weren’t the family to mess with as they have been known to make people disappear themselves.

College started and I graduated after 4 years majoring in business management. Things were going well until I received a phone call that mother was dying back in Stanford and was at the hospital. So I decided it was time to head back to the hometown. 

I was 23 now and felt things should have settled down by now about the whole Seth thing. I got into town on a Friday night, seen Mom and she told me I should go catch up with some people I havnt seen in over 4 years. So I decided to go to the Rusty Spoon it was a local bar and restaurant where all the people of Stanford gathered to drink and be merry. I went in ordered my favorite drink Scotch on the rocks. I didn’t recognize anyone. So I sat by myself and 2 became 3 an 3 became 5. 

It was 11 pm and I was feeling pretty buzzed. So I decided to pay my bill and head for home. As I was walking out the 3 Williams boys Ross, Jacob, and Nate walked in the bar. 

I tried to go unnoticed but they recognized me right away. Ross said “where you off too bud”, “we just got here didn’t know you was in town let me buy you one”. 
I felt I didn’t have a choice and accepted. I told them I had to go to the restroom first and I’ll be right out. Little did I know while I was in the restroom, the boys spiked my drink with GHB. 

I sat down with them, I had to get going soon I stated, so I drank the drink rather quickly. We started talking about the high school days and about Seth and they wouldn’t let me leave. Soon enough I felt super drunk and out of it. I  couldn’t even walk I remember them saying we will help you out. Then as we got outside they started beating me to death. I had no idea what was going on

I was knocked beyond unconscious. They loaded me up in there pickup bed wrapped in a blanket as they assumed I was dead. They took me way out into the woods up by a creek and started digging a hole to put me in. I found this out later when I came too in my buried alive shallow grave. 

They dumped my body in the hole and took off. I was finally coming to at this point. Struggling to breath with broken ribs, arm and a bad leg I was a wreck. I couldn’t die here is all I thought so I mustered up all the strength I had and started clawing dirt away reaching for the surface. Luckily they didn’t bury me all that deep. Finally after what seemed like a couple hours I was somewhat above ground. 
Struggling to move and in extreme pain, I crawled out of the grave and made my way toward the creek. I had to move quick as I didn’t know if they would come back to check. Overly exhausted from crawling outta the grave and to the creek, I passed out. 
 I awoke early the next morning, cold broken and almost would’ve rather been dead. I wasn’t too far from where they had dumped me I was within sight at least. I got up and hid next to a tree as I seen a vehicle approaching, It was the boys checking to see if I was still buried and dead I assumed. 

I started hobbling up the creek slowly but surely as I heard the one Williams boy yell out, “ he’s gone. He’s not in the grave what are we gonna do”? Another one shouted “what no way we gotta find him and finish this.” I was terrified at this point unarmed and halfway dead already. But to my luck they thought I was already on foot headed towards town so they got back in the truck and headed in the direction towards town. I was going the opposite way. 

It was a struggle making way up the creek as I knew there was an old general store a few miles up if I follow the creek. There I could get food, supplies and such and figure out a plan.  

It took me a full day to go maybe 2 miles and I had to rest again. When I awoke the next morning I made a sling outta my shirt and tree branches. I was still a hurting unit but I felt better than I did the day before. 

The plan was to keep following the creek and reach the general store before nightfall. I made my way to the highway and right across it was the general store. I had to be sure as shit I wouldn’t get seen crossing the highway, as I knew the boys were in a manhunt looking to finish me off. 

The coast was clear so made a break for it l. Hurrying across the road I wasn’t seen in fact there were no customers at the store I was in luck. I had 10$ to my name in my sock as they took my wallet to destroy evidence I assumed. 


I entered the store seen the clerk go into the back room on the phone I bought all the water and bandages and what little food I could for $10. I got to the counter and the clerk was an older gentlemen acting strange, he asked what happened trying to stall me it seemed like. I told him I had to go, and he smirked as he held up a pistol and said you ain’t going anywhere the boys are on there way now, I know exactly who you are. 
I was shocked they had a whole posse already out trying to find me before the sheriff did. I was hurt bad but the clerk was old I had to think fast, so I used my good arm and knocked the pistol outta his hand and I picked it up before he could react, and I shot and killed the bastard right behind the counter. I gathered more supplies quickly as I made my way for the exit. 

I hurried across the road into the trees to hide. I hunched down into an old culvert by the creek out of view. I could hear vehicles screeching into the parking lot across the road. It was the Williams boys. After what they discovered of the clerk they must’ve thought I was long gone again as they quickly left screeching tires flying up the road towards town. I was safe for the moment. I decided to stay where I was for the night. Now equipped with a gun and food and water I finally felt alive again. Like I had a chance to make it out of this.

The next day My goal became to kill them before they could me, I hurried along the tree line towards town, and towards the Williams ranch. They probably had people everywhere keeping an eye out for me, so I had to be on my toes at all times. 

They would never think that I would be hunting them, that I would probably be running for my life. At this point all I had was revenge on my mind as I was innocent in the whole Seth thing, and I already killed an old store clerk who sided with the boys. 

Still in agonizing pain I made it to outskirts of the Williams property, thinking on how I would plan my attack. I decided to set camp up in the woods outta sight. I felt it was me against the town at this point. 

I got up early at 5 am the Williams pickup was out front and the property was quiet. I prepared some Molotov cocktails to burn them out. I had to get them and be done with it. So I snuck around to the rear side of the ranch style house and lit both of the cocktails and chucked them right through the windows. 

Perfect shot as the house went up in flames in no time. I heard shouting and screaming from the inside as they were trying to put out the fire I crouched down by the garage waiting for them to exit one by one. 

First was Ross he was on fire trying to put himself out, I aimed my pistol and shot twice hitting him in the chest and head. Then the other two came out quick in a panic and I unloaded the rest of the rounds another six shots 3 each into the both of em. Jacob was dead Nate was coughing up blood trying to hold on as I approached him, feeling no remorse at all I finished him off with a big rock to his head. 

I was so relieved I had won. But I sensed this was far from over. I knew I was going to jail for murder now, but would anyone believe that they brought this upon themselves burying me alive thinking I was dead. 

I’m finishing up writing this at my mothers house where I have been hiding out the past couple weeks. I’m still in pretty bad shape but getting better daily, I don’t want to turn myself in until I am completely healed. Does anyone have any ideas of what I can do?
