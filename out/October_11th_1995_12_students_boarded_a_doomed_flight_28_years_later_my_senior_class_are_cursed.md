It’s not every day you wake up on a deserted island on your birthday.

I should be at home right now. 

Instead, I’m on the other side of town. 

It’s almost 4pm. I’m currently lying in the backseat of my brother’s car, trying to write in this awkward position. There's an order right now to capture seventeen year olds on sight. So, I'm in hiding. 

I’ll start by telling you exactly how I got here. 

Ever since I was twelve years old, I have been waking up on the same island.

It started like lucid dreaming, a world I wasn’t part of—more of an image in my head. But as I grew up, it became something more. 

Something I could touch, feel, taste, and sense around me. It was as real as my own reality, and this is where things started to get blurry. On my thirteenth birthday, I started to slowly bleed into this world, both through my body and mind. I did not just exist in this world. 

I was part of it. I had a life on it. I had thoughts that were not mine, worries, and struggles that were alien to me.  

I was aware I was sitting on sand that prickled between my toes. I could stand up and take slow strides towards the sea, reveling in the cool water lapping across my ankles. I could smell the salt in the air and the stench of my own BO ingrained into my skin. This island is not a paradise.

The sky is never blue, and when it is, I am hidden in the shade, watching the shoreline from afar. Fourteen years old, and I am no longer standing on the beach. I am… running. I wake up running, throwing myself through blurs of green. 

Trees. 

I can hear my own strangled breaths and feel my arms catapulting me into the thick brush that hits me in the face.  

I do not care about the uneven ground, navigating it easily, and like an animal, I throw myself deeper and deeper. When I come to a stop, I twist around, sensing every flash of movement, my toes primed in damp soil. I have a goal, but I am not sure what it is. I tip my head back and peer through the thick canopy of green shading the sky. The sun’s shadow dances across the horizon.

I am losing precious light. I need to eat.

The sudden snap of a branch contorts my body back to attention.

There.

I sense the heartbeat in my ears, strained breaths sending shivers creeping down my spine.

THUD THUD.

THUD THUD.

THUD THUD

It’s injured.

Movement ahead of me. It’s limping. I can see the way it stumbles in the brush, struggling to stand. I start forward with heavy breaths, a deep cavernous hole twisting me inside out, and a fog in my mind that drives away all logical thought. I can’t think. I don’t think. I am so hungry. 

That is what drives me closer, what tangles my feet in the ground. All I can think about is every hesitant step I take, holding out my arms like I won’t hurt it as I close in on my dinner. I am already fantasizing about ripping it open and drinking from its guts, guzzling down glistening insides. I imagine frosty cans of soda and Mom’s chicken pot pie. 

**Chocolate cake oozing with frosting.**  

It’s a deer. 

The first deer I’ve seen in a long time. 

But I’m not the only one looking for it. 

It’s been 248 of my breaths since I saw it. 235 since the others gave chase. 

They saw it first. 

But it’s always been finders keepers. 

Footsteps around me, shrill giggles, and cat-calls that boil my blood. I can taste their excitement and even my own. I am salivating. 

But so are they. 

There are three of them at the corner of my eye, and another two behind me. I go through my options. There is nothing to use as a weapon, and I am too weak to fight. I can retreat, but that means no food. I can join them, but surely that will entail I give them something. I lost all of them to the oblivion that drowns us. I am the last one with thought. I am the last human. I don’t do… what they do to survive. So, I must fucking eat. Slowly, I drop onto my hands and knees and start to crawl through the dirt. It’s so close. 

I can see hoof marks on the ground. The sound of the river is a relief. I’ve made it. The animal is drinking deep, guzzling from a small stream. My mouth waters, drool pooling down my chin. It just makes me more thirsty. Another branch snaps. 

I remember the feeling of my body being driven with adrenaline, trees whipping at my hair and scarring my face as I dive into a sprint. I know it’s a trap. But I’m losing precious sunlight. The deer is inches away.

I slip my hands into my pouch, my fingers inching slowly around the handle of my knife. I am surrounded.

They announce their presence with animal-like chitters and giggles.

Something flies over my head with perfect precision, piercing through the deer’s lower body. I don’t know what possessed me to attempt to take their kill. It’s not even theirs. They don’t eat animal meat. They don’t want the deer. They want me.

This is just another game.

I am a pawn, and they control the board. 

They circle around me, and my throat is too dry to tell them to back off. 

I am too weak to fight for my territory when they already have it. 

I have lost. But I keep going, even when they start screaming at me, warning me with vicious snarls. I am dizzy, my thoughts tangled, and my lips spread into a grin as I take one step, and then two, drunk on the idea of meat.  I am already mapping exactly where I will make the first cut, and how much fat and meat I can savor. Then, reality hits. I don’t have a knife. I lost it 1,985 breaths ago. 

Instead, my hands wrap around nothing. 

My pouch is empty. 

I just have the remnants of the ragged pieces of my shirt soaked in salt for a snack. Footsteps get closer, but I don’t move. I am still edging closer to the animal, hypnotized by the sharp smear of red soaking the earth. 

It soaks my toes, warm and wet—and I find myself liking it. I drop onto my knees fisting up handfuls of blood-soaked dirt and stuff it into my mouth. It tastes so good. It tastes like chocolate cake. I am laughing when fingers tangle in my ponytail and yank me back, rough arms wrapping themselves around me, clammy hands slamming over my mouth. I don’t scream when the cool blade dances across my throat. 

Instead, I start to wonder if maybe they have been right all along. I wonder if the flesh of my throat tastes better than dirt and leather soup. My fifteenth birthday was far more real. I couldn’t call it a dream anymore. I couldn’t call it a lucid dream or a psychotic break. This was happening to me.  This time there was no sea, no river, or running. Instead, I am sitting cross-legged in front of a fire. There are shadows around me without faces. I try to move, but I can’t. Sixteen was the same, but there was no fire. 

I am leaning against a wall, chunks cut out of me. I no longer have my right arm, and my lower leg had already been marked for the next feast. 

I can’t move. Someone kneels in front of me and I try and inch away, a cry strangled in my throat. They grab hold of my chin and force me to look at them, narrow fingers prying open my mouth and forcing water down my throat. 

The water is salty. 

I try to spit it out, my body automatically rejecting it, but that makes them more forceful. 

When I’ve drunk enough, they let go of me, and my body relaxes, my head hanging.

Living flesh is so much tastier.

I know that because I have tasted myself, charred, raw, and cooked to perfection. That was my last thought before my vision blurred, and I was waking up in my bed—my own life. 

It wasn’t real. 

That’s what I told myself. 

So, how could I still taste the seawater in my mouth? I woke to my pillows soaked with my drool, a strangled scream still tangled on my tongue. I could still feel the chunks taken out of me, my severed arm and leg that had been gnawed on.  I knew exactly what I tasted like. The flavor was still in my mouth no matter how many times I stuck my fingers, and then my fist, down my throat. 

I thought about therapy, but what exactly was I supposed to say? 

This year was entirely different from my other birthdays. 

I awakened to a rhythmic drumming and the dull glow of a fire. 

This time the shadows have faces. I don’t recognize them. I am smiling, as a boy wearing a crown of thorns entangled in bone kneels in front of me. In his hands is a chocolate cake lit with dancing flames. 

I count each one. 

There are more than sixteen candles, but I don’t care. 

The boy’s smile is carved into the dark, eyes illuminated burnt orange. 

He gently places the giant chocolate cake on the wooden table in front of me. 

I don’t look at the smears of scarlet and entrails stained to it. 

I look at the cake. It’s so beautiful. My mouth waters. I reach to carve my fingers into it, and my hands are slapped away. 

“Dude,” the boy chuckled. He picked up a blade sitting on the table and pressed it into my fist.  There is no real light in his eyes. The light I used to know, what ignited his humanity—what I loved, has been replaced with a hollow gleam that only knows how to hunt and feed.  He entangles his fingers in mine as I stare, hypnotized by candlelight. He leans close to me, his cool breath tickling my ear. 

“Make a wish first.” 

I can't see an identity, only a crown of bone sitting on dark curls. Starving eyes. 

His voice is both familiar and not. The others echoed his words and the exact movement of his lips. I do. I close my eyes and make a wish. The drumming grows louder when I blow out my candles, only for them to reignite, something writhing across the skin of my arms. I can already feel it bleeding into me in the form of wriggling insects filling my mouth, skittering up and down my spine. It’s delving into my mind, already burning away what I fought to protect. But I want to eat. I want to fill myself up until I am bulging, until I can’t eat anymore. 

I don’t want to stop.

I want to eat until I burst open. 

The others start to laugh, animalistic shrieks pushing me to take the first slice. I let the blade sink in, and the satisfaction of watching it penetrate each layer makes me salivate. Thick buttercream filling escapes from within and I lapped it up. The taste sends me into a frenzy. 

Then, the rest of us.  The others are crowding around me. First, they are hesitant, stumbling back and then slowly moving closer, noses wrinkling. It doesn't take them long before they strike, each of them delving deep into the cake. I watch them, mesmerized by what stains their faces, caught in their teeth, and dripping down their chin. Cake. 

Swallowing hard, I  couldn’t stop myself, carving my fingernails into rich frosting and stuffing it into my mouth, a moan slipping from my lips. I started slowly and grew ravenous. A figure next to me grasps holds of wet dripping chocolate, and I snatched it off of him, squawking out in protest. The cake starts to look less like a cake, and more like something else entirely. I squeezed my eyes shut and imagined more layers instead of prickly bones I was skimming my fingers over. I couldn't stop myself. I was gorging, choking on chocolate buttercream and frosting when a shrill squeak sliced into my mind, snapping me back to reality.

**“Oh my god, what the hell are you doing?!**

My vision blurred, shadowy figures covered in sharp shades of red morphing into my mother’s favorite kitchen tiles.

Mom's cry jerked me back to fruition. 

I blinked rapidly, swallowing something slimy wriggling its way back up my throat. The taste of the cake was very real in my mouth, chocolate spew dribbling down my chin. I could already feel my cheeks starting to burn. The refrigerator was open, casting me in warm golden light. I was standing in my kitchen  covered in what had been my seventeenth birthday cake. 

The majority of it was smeared all over my mouth, while the rest was crushed on the floor. It wasn’t just the cake. Somehow, I’d managed to go through three packs of cookies, half of a rotisserie chicken, and the leftovers from dinner.  

Looking down at myself, I was oozing chocolate cake. It was caked into my fingernails and smeared all over my pajamas. Mom was standing in the doorway, her lips twisted with silent fury, my older brother peeking behind the door. My stomach twisted suddenly, chocolate-coated bile filling my mouth. 

I didn't have an explanation for this. 

Part of me was still searching for that part of me back on the island, feasting on something wet and slimy. 

Raising my chocolaty hands in a sort of surrender, I struggled to speak through chunks of cake I had to spit out. "I'm... I’m sorry," I managed to say, like this was some Saturday morning cartoon. I didn't think my Mom's eyes could pop out of her head, but they were close. In the back of my eyes, I could still see the glow of the fire, vicious stains of red dripping from the table, pooling on the ground, staining me.

"I was…hungry.” 

I caught my brother’s amused smirk.

“We can see that. You’ve eaten half the refrigerator.”

“Kit,” Mom hissed at him to leave, and he did, after scraping a piece of chocolate cake from the packaging on the counter and darting out of the room. “Sweetie, what happened?”

Swiping my hands on my pyjama shirt, that feral instinct still contorted inside me telling me to back away from her. My mom was a threat. 

“Hey,” she held up her hands. Her eyes were wide, fearful, almost like she understood. “It’s okay, baby."

Mom was slowly making her way over to me, her expression twisting from anger to confusion, and then sympathy.

I knew what she was thinking already. I felt sudden revulsion, tears stinging my eyes. It took two strides for me to make it to the faucet, and I choked up undigested pieces of cake and lumps of chicken. The chicken looked too slimy, too wet—too red, hitting the bottom of the sink. Fuck.

Mom held my hair back, and I was trembling, trying to speak through my twisted lips and heaving stomach projectiling everything I forced down.  When the dull glow of flame had faded from my mind, and I was sure I could no longer hear drumming getting closer, I dropped to my knees. “Fee?” Mom was saying my name over and over again, and it took me several seconds to register it. 

Fee. That was my name. 

I managed to apologize and made for the door, but Mom was already gently leading me to the table and sitting me down. She placed a glass of water in front of me and made me drink it. I didn’t know how to explain it, so I lied. I told her I had been binge eating, and her expression broke my heart. I went back to bed with a thick feeling in my gut. I could still taste seawater. 

I didn’t sleep. Instead, I googled symptoms of psychosis. Mom came into my room 4 hours later when my alarm was going off, and I was half asleep, scrolling through Instagram. 

Levi Carlisle had posted another one of his conspiracy theory videos. It was about the so-called “curse” on our senior class. I opened up the video, which already had 5 views.

It’s not hard to fearmonger in a school already gripped by paranoia. 

Before I could click on the video, which was Levi looking like a junior Philip De Franco, complete with the expression, Mom was peeking through my door with a brand-new cake, my brother trailing behind, sleepy-eyed. I had to guess they had run to Costco earlier to get me another one. I didn’t want to do the whole “happy birthday” thing, after ruining the cake she actually made, but I managed to smile and grit my teeth through her singing, while my brother acted like he was singing against his will. 

I followed the two down to breakfast, grabbing coffee and toast. 

I happen to be born on an awkward day. 

The people in my town don’t celebrate. 

They mourn.

**October 11th, 1995:**

Our school’s entire chess team boarded a flight on a school trip and was never seen again.

Following their disappearance, a series of… unfortunate events have plagued our town’s senior class. Sometimes it skips years, so we never know when it’s going to happen.

**October 11th, 2005. Two football players collapsed and died on the field.**

**October 11th, 2010. Wendy Tate, class valedictorian, fell off the stage during her welcome speech and snapped her neck.**

**October 11th, 2015. Three senior cheerleaders died after the bus carrying the team drove off a cliff.**

**October 11th, 2021.  Ten students in my brother’s class perished in a fire in the gym.**

Kit poured himself a bowl of cereal, throwing me a clumsily wrapped birthday gift.  Standing in front of the window, he was more shadow than human, and I could almost pretend his face wasn’t scarred beyond recognition. The present skidded into my lap. “Happy birthday, sis.”

Pulling off the packaging, I was unable to resist my own smile. 

Every year for our birthdays, we got each other a “joke gift.”

I held up a Barbie hairbrush, complete with a singing toothbrush.

“Topical.”

He grinned. “I knew you’d like it.”

Mom leaned against the countertop, delicately sipping her coffee. It took her exactly 3 and a half minutes to say exactly what I knew she was going to say. She even laughed at Kit’s joke gift, even when she made it clear they were not allowed. 

I could tell she was worried about me either being a binge eater, or worse, the possibility that I could be under the influence of the curse. 

“Why don’t you stay home today, honey?”

I noticed the air around us thicken significantly, Mom’s words hanging in the air like spoiled milk. Kit broke the silence, loudly chewing on his cereal. “Mom, she’ll be fine.”

“You don’t know that” she surprised me by snapping at Kit. “Do you want the same thing to happen to your sister?”

Mom was going into panic mode. She washed dishes when she was stressed, and she was already striding over or to the washing-up bowl despite us having a dishwasher. “I’ve been talking to Pastor Worthington,” she didn’t turn around, speaking through heavy breaths. “And he is willing to place protection on the two of you.” Kit shot me a look, and I rolled my eyes. 

Pastor Worthington wasn't even a pastor, and I was pretty sure he was scamming my mother, taking advantage of her pain. Every year she managed to convince herself it was all her fault. Mom never talked about being in the same class as the missing chess team. When we were little kids, she mentioned that she lost some friends when she was younger. I remember being five years old and standing under a big tree while Mom held a bouquet of flowers, her head bowed in prayer. 

When we almost lost Kit, she was convinced the missing 1995 kids were punishing her from the great beyond. “Here we goooo,” Kit mumbled into his orange juice with an overexaggerated eye-roll.

“I’m okay,” I said through a mouthful of toast, “I’m going to the memorial game tonight.” I knew my words had stung, because Mom did that thing when her nose scrunches, lips pursing. For the last few years, she had done everything she could to keep me away from school on October 11th. Even when it was only seniors who were affected. I moved to the faucet to dump my plate, and I could feel her eyes burning into me. 

I looked up, my gaze flicking to Kit, who was staring down at his phone. Mom did her best to avoid his eyes. When she meant to look at him, she focused on me instead. It hurt her to see him. The morning before he left for school, three years ago, she told him that curses did not exist, and nothing was going to happen to him. 

I remember being in my sophomore year, excited to start school, and Kit joking about the curse. Mom told him to grow up. 

Seven hours later, our school gym had been set alight, and eight students were dead, with Kit in the ICU, and another kid barely clinging to life. 

He died. Kit lived. 

I knew her dismissive words that morning still drove my mother crazy. It was why she quit her job as a nurse and started drinking. I almost lost my brother. It was a miracle that he survived, and somehow our relationship had not changed over the years. It was still meaningless and stupid sibling banter. Kit dropped his spoon. “It’s cool, Mom,” he said, shooting her a wide smile, “I’m going too, so I’ll look after her.” He shot me a look which definitely said he wasn’t planning on going, and that I would have to find another ride home. Kit hadn’t even attended his classmates’ funeral.  

The town thought he was selfish, but he had broken down three times since their deaths. Mom said it was survivors guilt. I had a hard time looking at him that morning, early morning sunlight alleviating his profile; thick strands of dark hair sitting under his usual baseball cap. 

He was already dressed for the day as usual. Most likely because he hasn’t slept. Kit was still handsome. Before the fire, he was taking his friends to homecoming, the four of them in some polycule thing.  

Then he lost them and stopped looking after himself completely. Kit let his beard grow out, which weirdly suited him, and Mom had to force him to get a haircut. The entire left side of his face was scarred tissue and attempted skin grafts, bulging red skin flaps stitched down. 

He sent me a questioning glance, and I had to look away, my early morning dessert binge making a reappearance. 

Kit’s face didn’t usually bother me, but that morning there was something about him that stood out. 

“You’re staring at me,” my brother grumbled, “And it’s getting kinda weird.”

I bit into my toast, avoiding his raised brow.

Instead of answering him, I came out with a question I didn’t know was suffocating my thoughts. 

“Did they ever find the black box?”

Kit kicked me under the table, grumbling a warning. 

“What?” 

“No,” Mom responded, and the two of us twisted to her. Kit shot me a surprised look. It was rare when she talked about her missing classmates.

Sometimes I forgot they were even in her class. If either of us mentioned that doomed flight, we were shut down. Mom continued scrubbing at plates. I noticed she was repeatedly washing the same plate over and over again.

“No, they never found anything.”

I nodded slowly, another question bubbling in my mouth—words that were not mine. 

“Where were they going again?"

Mom dropped a plate in the faucet, and the loud clang made me jump.

Even Kit winced a little. 

“Fee, I think that’s enough questions.”

“They were going to the chess championships,” I kept going, even when Kit kicked me again. I couldn’t stop. “But why is there no news about it?”

“Fee.” Kit really went to town on making sure the toe of his shoe went right into my kneecap. “Read the room.”

“No, it’s okay,” Mom cleared her throat and turned to face us. Her hands were bright red from the boiling hot water. “There was no news because the town and families chose to keep it private. 

"It is a…” she trailed off, her expression twisting. “It is a town tragedy and will stay one.” Mom didn’t speak for the rest of breakfast. She poured herself a glass of wine and headed upstairs. Probably to down the whole thing. We were used to it, but it still kind of hurt. I was hoping Mom would stay sober for my 17th. With Mom gone, Kit leaned across the table, on his third or fourth helping of cereal. 

Jesus, how hungry was he?

“What the fuck was that?”

I stood up instead of answering him. “I was just curious. "

“Curious?” Kit leaned on his fist. “You haven’t spoken about mom’s classmates since we were little kids, and you bring them up today of all days?” 

I grabbed my backpack. “So?”

“So,” Kit narrowed his eyes. “Is there something wrong?” He cocked his head. “We’re really not going to talk about you café-de-cake this morning?” For a moment, my brother’s voice was drowned out by a drum beat. I heard them in my head like they were close,  getting closer with each of my strangled breaths. It was almost like a heartbeat. 

I lost myself in the drumming, in blurred shadows dancing in my peripheral.

Ba-bum.

Ba-bum.

Ba-bum.

“Hey!”

I blinked, and Kit was nose to nose with me clapping his hands in my face.

I shrugged, pasting on a smile. “I was hungry.”

Kit held up his bowl of cereal. “*This* is hungry, Fee,” he nodded to the leftover smears of chocolate cake on the counter. “Whatever that was? That was fucking ravenous.”

I really did not want to have this conversation with him. “Can you not be Mom for like, two seconds?" 

He scoffed. "Well, she's not being one right now, is she? Mom is doing what she always does on your birthday. Running away." 

That stung, but he was right. 

"You're an asshole."

"I'm your brother," he sighed. "I have to be." Kit paused. “You should probably rethink going to school, Fee."

I didn’t reply, leaving my brother in the kitchen. 

I could still feel his gaze burning into the back of my head when I was halfway out of the door. Thankfully, my morning classes were too loud to hear the drums, and even stuck in silence in a bathroom stall or a classroom swamped in a vacuum, there was no sign of them. Levi Carlisle cornered me at lunch, sticking his phone in my face. “Did your Mom agree to an interview?”

I got his email two nights prior. He wanted to interview my mother, the only class of 95 still in town. Levi was an interview away from sending my Mom in a downward spiral if he started spewing his conspiracy theories in her face. I shoved the kid out of the way, as gently as I could.

“She’s sick,” I said dryly,  quickening my steps. “If you go near her, you’ll die.”

Levi nodded, struggling to keep up. “Okay, so maybe next week?” he said hurriedly. “I’ve been trying to get in touch with a woman who moved to New York, but she’s like, impoooosible to get hold of. Her daughter keeps answering and telling me to leave her alone, but I think I’m making progress. She was one of the missing’s best friends, so I was thinking I could ask her about their friendship, and then get to the good stuff.” Levi had a weird gleam in his eyes. 

I would not be surprised if he broke into our house and held my Mom at gunpoint for an interview. 

“Maybe she wants you to leave them alone,” I said, heavily hinting I wanted the exact same thing. I tried to sidestep him, but he was high on getting a good story, eyes alight, no humanity or empathy in sight. The boy danced in front of me like a real reporter. He wasn’t going to give up on this story. "Kit was the only survivor in 2021," he said excitedly. We passed the vigil for the kids lost over the years, and I heard it again. 

That same drum beat. 

"Don't you think it's a bit weird that your brother was spared while his friends died? He was in the ICU, correct?" 

Something slimy prickled across the flesh of my arm. I thought back to my brother’s burns, and the opinion our town had of him. He was a survivor, but in their eyes, he was a coward. He should have run back into the flames. "You're a leech, Levi.”

Levi was oblivious as always, continuing to push.  “Well, what do you think about the curse?” He asked instead, and an influx of crawlies slithered down my spine. “Your brother was affected three years ago, right? What if it’s coming after you next?”

His lips curved into the slightest of smirks, and I could almost mistake excitement on his face.

This bastard wanted it to happen. 

I opened my mouth to answer him, but then I could hear them again.

Drumming.

Suddenly, all the sound had been sucked out of the world. 

I felt myself tip left, and then right, my brain spinning. 

Ba-bum. 

Ba-bum. 

Ba-bum. 

I was paralyzed for a disorienting second, drowning in that darkness once again, that oblivion lit up in orangeade light. 

Levi was waving his hands in front of me before another shadow stepped in front of him. The familiar face relieved the pressure building behind my eyes, and I blinked back darkness spotting my vision.  “Yo, Fee," Rowan Bellamy looked disheveled as usual. But his usual wide smile and floppy fringe was like a bout of fresh air. The drums faded in my head, replaced with hallway ambiance. I gathered myself, drinking my friend in. 

School was tolerable with him by my side. Rowan was wearing yesterday's sweater over scuffed jeans, toothpaste still staining his bottom lip. I noticed Levi snapping a quick shot with his camera. No doubt for his "worst dressed" weekly column. 

“What BS is Carlisle spewing this time?" He shot Levi a grin. "No offense, of course! I'm a huge fan of your weird ass conspiracy videos.”

Levi scowled. “I know you’re being sarcastic.”

“Oh, really?” Rowan folded his arms. “Now, what gave you that idea?”

“It’s not all bullshit,” Levi said. “Something is coming,” he started to back away, lifting his camera for emphasis. “The bugs festering on the sidewalk? How about the mysterious flu that’s making toddlers sick? We’re in the end times now, and we,” he gestured to the three of us. “We’re the catalysts. I think we were chosen by a higher power. That’s why we’re cursed.”

"Like Zeus?" 

Levi's lip curled. "Do you take anything seriously?" 

Rowan’s smile didn’t waver. He didn’t believe in curses. Rowan just thought we were just really unlucky.

It was hard to get him to believe in anything. According to him, we were alone in the universe, and the paranormal was just another cash grab for gullible people. My best friend was a firm believer in all things science. I think it was a comfort for him. When Kit almost died, he was the closest he had ever been to maybe believe something was going on, before suppressing it. 

He started towards Levi with slow, intimidating steps. Levi didn’t back down though. He probably had dirt on Rowan somewhere to humble him. “The bugs are probably because of the storm, it’s flu season, believe it or not. Kids always get sick. It's not the world ending plague you think it is." Rowan laughed, flicking him in the forehead. "There’s no curse, idiot! If there IS a curse and I end up affected, I’ll give you my college fund.” He snapped his fingers. “No, scratch that. I’ll give you my college fund AND my PS5.”

The junior reporter's eyes lit up. “All of it?”

“All 70k of it, baby.”

Levi didn’t say anything, but he did get an odd smile on his face before skulking away to annoy someone else. “That boy is certifiable,” Rowan grumbled, turning to me. “Did you see his latest YouTube video?”

“Did you really just bet away your college fund?”

He rolled his eyes, tipping his head back. “Duuuuude, not you too. Levi is clearly driving the crazy train. If you watch his video, he thinks seniors have like, fucking magical powers.”

I bit into my sandwich, suddenly ravenous.

Ba-bum.

Ba-bum.

Ba-bum.

“I haven’t seen it.”

He grinned. “You should have. He’s convinced we’re ALL cursed this year.”

I didn’t respond to that, though my stomach did twist into knots. I waited for something—anything—to happen all day. My afternoon classes were tense, with everyone expecting a head to explode, or a fire to ignite out of nowhere. 

Rowan spent the whole of my last class muttering a countdown under his breath and kicking my desk playfully. It was when the bell rang, and we all seemed to let out a synchronized sigh of relief when the drums started again. This time they were dull, barely audible. But somehow they felt and sounded closer. That morning, they felt like they were far away back on the island. Now, however, they were waiting for me, light grazing the back of my mind. I didn’t waste time heading out of class, with Rowan following me. 

“Are you coming to the memorial game? I heard Harry is going to play tonight, even when Coach said his shoulder isn’t healed. He never listens to me, you know? I tell him one thing, and he does the opposite—” Rowan’s voice was definitely there, but the drums were drowning him out. They were slower, reverberating in my skull.  

I felt like I was walking on air, almost trance-like, my body on automatic, for the rest of the evening. I went home to grab food. Mom was curled up on the sofa cradling two empty bottles of wine. 

Then I decided that yes, I was going to the memorial game. If that meant avoiding Mom for the rest of the evening, then so be it. It almost felt like dreaming. 

I didn’t remember getting a chilli dog or even meeting Rowan. When I blinked, however, and fully came to fruition, the two of us had already grabbed seats. The air was thick with the stink of fried food, and I was slowly suffocating, squashed shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the crowd.  

I didn’t realize I was chewing mechanically on a hot dog.

“That’s your fourth one,” Rowan nudged me with a laugh, his gaze on the field following his brother. “Usually, you can barely stomach a full dog."

“I’m just hungry!" I yelled over the crowd.

That wasn't a lie. I was starving, and nothing could quench it. I found myself thinking about food the whole of the first half, my gate flitting to the hot food truck behind the bleachers. The drums were growing louder in my head. Closer. 

I could sense them whispering. 

They were like footsteps. 

And when the game was slowly coming to a climax, and I was on cloud nine, my thoughts enveloped with them, my vision flashing from blurred, confusing orange of fire to brightly lit football field-- that was when they stopped. Rowan dived to his feet, grabbing hold of my arm, and in my daze, I turned to him. His mouth was stretched into a wide grin, his eyes wild. I had barely noticed the kids around us shooting up from their seats, beer and candy flying everywhere. Our school had scored. 

Harry Bellamy, Rowan's brother, threw his arms around his teammates, the group of them mimicking the crowd chant. I stared dazedly at the boy throwing his helmet off to cheer loudly when a familiar voice entered my head, bleeding into my skull. 

*"Do you guys want to hear a story?"*

Something severed inside me, my reality contorting. I was back sitting in darkness, that empty cavern in my gut gnawing. I felt that yearning.

Hunger. 

Around me, figures came into view. I was seeing faces stained with filth and blood, crowns of flowers and bone. The speaker was sitting in front of me. *"A mother will give anything to her children," he murmured. *"Especially a mother who abandoned her children and left them to fucking rot."*

I blinked, and Harry's smile was too wide. 

His hand slipped into his pocket, fingers wrapped around something. When he pulled it out, I caught the sharp edge of the blade. Screams erupted suddenly, and Rowan dived forward. I grabbed him, though I wasn't sure why. Rowan dropped to his knees, his gaze glued to his brother. 

*"So they..."* The guy continued in my head. 

Ba-Bum. 

In the darkness, the other shadows began to chant in low murmurs, and through the fog quickly clouding my eyes. When he pressed the blade against his throat, still grinning wildly at the crowd, I realized there was no life in his eyes. His expression had been contorted by something else. Something I could sense had reached us, phantom fingers reaching into the back of our heads, bleeding into our thoughts. 

The drums started up again, growing louder and louder until they were deafening me, suffocating me.

Harry slid the teeth of the knife across his throat, teasing, his smile stretching wide across his face. 

This time, it was his lips that formed those words whispering into my skull. I could sense them on mine too. 

*"Can feast."*

I wasn't paying attention when Harry sliced his own throat open, and even when blood spurted in scarlet rivulets, seeping down the curve of his neck, he was still smiling. I was listening to the drums that were deafening now, slamming into my ears. Rowan was eerily still, his gaze glued to his brother, a certain hollowness spreading across his face. His body seemed to jolt, eyes flickering, all of the light, the humanity, fizzling out. 

He could hear them, I realized. 

The drums.

All around me, the kids in our class had come to a standstill, going limp, like their puppet strings had been cut. In the back of my eyes, the fire was extinguished. Harry Bellamy's body hit the ground, and my world exploded. 

Next to me, Rowan snatched what was left of my chilli dog, and stuffed it into his mouth with an animalistic hiss, baring his teeth. He stumbled back, his head whipping back and forth, nose flaring. Then he was on his knees, licking candy and beer off of the floor, diving to his feet and tearing along the row, stumbling, snatching at food wildly, like an animal. But he wasn't the only one. 

All around me, kids were throwing themselves at anything edible, gorging on anything in sight. 

I'm not sure how I can describe the feeling of coming in and out of consciousness. I was in the stands with Rowan, my head spinning, blood trickling down my temple, hot and wet, and then I was kneeling on a mostly empty football field, bodies strewn around me. Time had passed, but I wasn't sure how much. 

I spat out chilli, a lump of cotton candy, and a bloody chunk of my own tongue. The night was alive around me, shadows dancing around me, people running for escape, and seniors gathering in packs, roaming the field. Their strides mimicked the drums clanging in our heads. In front of me, the cheer team knelt on the ground, crowded around a body. I saw the red pooling on the grass, smears decorating their uniforms. 

The girls were fighting over their coach's corpse, tearing each other apart over flaps of flesh caked into their manicures, and delving into the root of his gut, feasting on blurs of red. I stood, or tried to stand, but my body was no longer mine. There was an old man hobbling across the field, and in a confusing blur of movement, I was on my feet, sprinting towards him, my mouth was watering. 

I dived onto his back, bringing him to the ground. 

The dark enveloped me, as my body took control. 

But I was still eating, gnawing through stringy meat that stuck in my teeth. 

Fighting with others over glistening entrails on the ground.

Running through the blaze of my town, throwing myself at anything that moved, that smelled of meat. 

I awoke three times during that night…

Once, standing in front of the 1995 memorial, my head cocked, staring at the vigil, a splatter of red decorating one particular photo of the missing 12 kids. I squinted, slowly coming back to fruition. No. 

13. 

I had walked past this cabinet hundreds of times. 

How did I only just notice the thirteenth member of the chess team? 

A snarl came from behind me, and I twisted around to find Rowan, leading a pack of his own. There was something red, something slithering, hanging out of his mouth. Whatever instincts had bled into me, told me he wasn't a threat. 

His eyes were completely taken over by a darkness I couldn't understand, lips bared like an animal. Taking slow steps toward me, his movements signalled he didn't want to eat me. Rowan jerked his head back and forth, like he was  shaking his head, a sharp animal-like squeak escaping his lips. He wanted me to join his gang. Before I could respond, rough arms were wrapping around my waist, yanking me back.

The prick of a needle in the back of my neck. 

The second time I awoke, I was on a school bus, bound and gagged. Rowan was next to me, his animal-like chittering and shrieking noises waking me up. The whole bus was filled with them, my classmates turned into animals, chained to their seats. The sheriff told us we were under the influence of a pathogen. 

He said he was taking us somewhere safe, and there was a shoot to kill order if we tried to escape the bus. 

If we were violent in any way, our parents have given them permission to get rid of us. 

The third time I awoke, was this morning. I was lying on my back in my brother's truck. Outside, our town was still on fire.

From the sounds in the trunk, Kit has captured Rowan too. 

I only have knowledge from the animal channel, but when you kill or capture the leader of a pack, don't the rest track them down…?

Kit still isn't back, and I'm terrified I'm going to end up like the others.

I just have to hope and pray I'm not caught… 

Because me and mom need to have a talk.
