. I have been worried about him for a little while now, but I didn't think it was such a big deal as it's turned out to be. Really, I still don't know that I would have reached out if it wasn't for our kid.

I guess it all started a few months back. My husband (I'll call him James) and I had had a bit of an argument. This wasn't super abnormal, but I do admit that I think I took it a little bit too far this time. We've been working on it, but this was one of those times where your emotions just take over before your brain can, you know? But we were fighting again, and I said what I said, and he left. This, actually *was* weird. He's never just up and left before, and I felt this pain in my chest right after the car left the driveway.

After a few hours, I tried to call him. At the time, I let it go, figuring he was just mad at me still. Hell, I'm still mad at myself for it. Maybe then things would be different. A few days passed, and I tried calling him again. And again. And again. Every single time, my phone would ring for a few minutes and then go to voicemail. On day 4 or 5 (I don't quite remember), it started to go straight to voicemail. I still almost wondered if he was actually going to leave me this time and was just ghosting me, but we're *married*, so it's not like that's really an option, right?

So, I finally gave in and called one of his friends. He actually did pick up, so James probably hadn't gone to him, I figured. We talked for a second, and I came clean about what happened. I told him how I was scared now. It had been almost a week since I'd even heard from my husband, how could I not be? The friend hadn't seen him either. My heart sank. I tried a few more of his close friends, and there was still nothing. I even called James again to leave another voicemail in hopes he was just screening my calls. Still. Nothing.

I think that was when I stopped sleeping, too. Nothing was working. I laid awake every single night knowing that if the love of my life turned up dead, there would be nobody to blame but me. I would have to break the news to our daughter, and she would hate me even more than I already hated myself. All over a stupid fucking argument. I filed a missing persons report two days later.

The only reason I'd waited that long even was *because* of the argument, honestly. He was a grown man, he could absolutely handle himself. He's tall (over 6ft) and strong too, it's not like an attacker could take him down very easily. If something did happen, I knew I'd be suspect no.1 and admitting that we'd been fighting would only make me look more suspicious, but I just couldn't bear to think of my husband really, actually being dead. So I reported it.

Another week passed, but they did find him. Thank god. They never did find our vehicle, but he was safe, so there wasn’t anything I could really complain about. Cars are replaceable, a husband and father is not. I’ve never wanted to have to replace him. I’ve never wanted to replace him. 

Until now. 

All of that is just backstory for right now. He’s been back and living with us now for about a month, but something about him is just so… *wrong*. I don’t even really know how to explain it. 

I think the first thing I noticed were his eyes. I can feel them on me constantly now. Hell, I feel them even now as I write this, even though he’s out of the house (a luxury now becoming more and more rare). They’re so sharp. It’s not that usual feeling of being watched, like if he were checking me out or just observing what I was doing, it’s like he’s physically trying to see through me. Like he’s tearing through my skin with just his eyes. Initially I did just think I was going crazy or that he was mad at me, but I can hardly pry him from me now. 

I used to pretend to sleep at night for extra time to cuddle with James, but now I fake sleeping to roll away from him instead. If I get up to do the dishes, he gets up and follows me and is entirely wrapped around me. I feel like I shouldn’t mind this, but it’s just so different from our norm that I can’t shake that feeling that something here isn’t right. I feel like he’s just going to surgically attach himself to me at some point to keep me closer to him. Or like one night he’ll unveil a mass of tentacles or excess limbs and just never let me go. So far, there haven’t even been any signs of this, thankfully. 

He looks the same as he used to, but there’s still just something about him that’s not right. Maybe his face looks more sullen (Is that the right word?) or he just looks tired, I don’t know. But I swear that there’s something different. I think that it might be his eyes too, if it’s not just his face. It’s almost like they don’t shine anymore. There’s no life in his expressions, like he doesn’t use his eyes the way he used to. It’s just soulless staring now. I miss the way he used to look at me. Even if we were fighting. I’ll happily take a glare or side-eye over the nothingness I’ve got right now. 

Again though, he’s just *so clingy*. He’s been showering with me, which he’s just never done before (he usually showers in the morning while I do at night), he sits outside of the bathroom and scratches at the door like some sort of dog whenever I lock him out. It’s weird! I don’t know if other couples are like that, but we never have been and I certainly hate it now!

Even our daughter can tell that something is off. She turns to give me weird looks when James isn’t looking. She’s started to cling to me, too. I can’t imagine what she’s feeling right now, really. She’s quite young, so I’m not even sure if she fully understands what’s happening, but she’s clearly put off by it too. Her once kind and loving father now almost acts like he doesn’t fully know who she is. I don’t actually think he’s said her name since he’s been back, now that I stop to think about it. Those two used to be inseparable… God, I feel so terrible for her. 

Then, there’s his midnight activities. I don’t know if that’s the right word, but I suppose it works. Every night, he’s been getting up and just leaving our bed. I don’t know if he’s got an actual schedule for it, but it’s always sometime between 1 and 2am. I don’t think he knows that I’m even awake when he does it. He just gets up and goes into the house for a few hours, then he comes back around when I “wake up.” 

Two nights ago, I got curious about it. I lied in wait, and sure enough, he was out of bed at the same time he is every night. I waited a little bit longer. I couldn’t get myself out of bed for a second, and I didn’t want to just pop up and follow him right out the gate. I counted as each second passed, and gave him a few minutes. Finally, I pulled myself up and tiptoed into the ball to find him. 

And find him I did. 

I kept myself tucked in the hallway and peered around the corner at him. He was stood in our kitchen, leaned over a bubbling pot. I don’t know what was in it, but I’m also not sure if I actually want to know at this point. Maybe he’ll kill me and I’ll finally be free of this whole thing. I took one more step, only barely touching the kitchen floor. 

There was a snapping sound as his head spun around to look at me. He looked at me at a somewhat odd angle, too. Part of me wonders how he didn’t snap his own neck. A second later, his body turned towards me as well. It was dark, but the low light from the stove hood reflected off of his eyes. They were wide as he stared me down. He smiled slightly too. Nothing big and wide like you see in horror movies, but it was enough to make the hair on my neck stand on end. He took a slow, tedious step towards me. I took a step back, pulling both my feet back into the hallway. He took two steps now, still just as slow and meticulous as the last one. I found myself completely unable to move, like he’d frozen me in place. My heart was pounding in my ears so loudly that I couldn’t even think up a way out. 

My stomach began to churn. He took three more of those steps. On his third step though, he somehow managed to lose his balance and he nearly tottered to the ground before his foot landed silently onto the wood. He finished his slow walk towards me and put his cold (no, *freezing*) hands onto my face. He was gentle in his touch, and he stroked my cheek softer than a spring breeze before giving me a kiss. He straightened himself up after that, still keeping his soulless and small smile on his face. He then spoke to me, and said: 

“Go back to bed, \[my name\]. It’s too late for you here.” 

I couldn’t think to do anything but listen to him, so I nodded. He turned me around and gave me a little pat on the back before sending me back to our room. I just went in and laid down. 

I don’t want to say it like this, but I’m scared of my husband. He’s not been violent with me or our daughter at all yet, but I don’t doubt that he’s capable of it. I don’t know, actually- He doesn’t start arguments or even play-argue anymore like he used to. I’ve been thinking of reaching out to his friends again, too, but I don’t know if they’ll be of any help. I feel so wrong for feeling this way, but I don’t know what to do. I blame myself for it all though. If it weren’t for that stupid fight, then I would have my actual husband back. God, I don’t know what to do.
