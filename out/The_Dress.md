The best day of my life was my wedding.

The best part wasn’t the ceremony, it wasn’t the reception, it wasn’t even the groom. No, no. The best part of my wedding was my dress. I absolutely loved my dress the second I put it on. I loved being in it, the feel of it, the way it swished as I walked. I was heartbroken when the wedding was over, and I had to put it away. 

My new husband suggested getting it altered so that I could wear it as often as I wanted, but I was horrified to even think about altering such perfection! Instead, I got a case for it, so that everyone could see its beauty without it getting ruined by dust or grubby hands. Of course, when I’m alone at home, I wear it as much as I can. The only reason I stay in shape is so that I can continue to fit in the dress without altering its perfect shape.


My house, on the other hand, I absolutely hate. The random creaks, the way it sinks, the walls, the way it smells. The worst of all though, is the black mold that made its appearance a few weeks after we moved in. I can’t seem to get rid of it, and I have literally tried EVERYTHING! I have scrubbed every wall and floor with bleach, I bought dehumidifiers to dry the house out, I even called professionals so often, they know me by name! Nothing is getting this mold out!


My husband suggested that the source has to be in our old things, and suggested getting rid of them. We got rid of everything except my dress. There was no way I was getting rid of it! This caused several fights between us. My husband says I don’t know how to let things go and not compromise, like seriously?! I know how to compromise! It’s he who doesn’t, the gaslighting asshole. 


After a few too many fights over the goddamn source of this goddamn mold, I finally had enough and told him the truth: if it was between him and my dress, I would choose my dress every single time, so he can either accept that or leave. Leave he did. I certainly wasn’t expecting that. I suppose this means divorce. 


At least, I rationalized, I can wear my dress for my next wedding.


 I went to look at it one last time, it was where I had left it, in all it’s perfect glory, I hadn’t had time to wear it as much as I wanted with this mold issue, but now that my (ex) husband and I are going to sell the house and split the equity, the mold issue is going to be someone else’s problem. 


I unlocked the case, only to find the mold scent much, much stronger than I ever have before. I frantically pulled out the dress and started searching for mold. I didn’t have to search very far.

A giant culture of mold rotted the dress from the inside out.
