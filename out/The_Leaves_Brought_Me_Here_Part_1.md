I know it sounds strange to say that leaves brought me to whatever this place is, and honestly I don’t much understand it myself. Maybe it’ll all make sense to me when I investigate this place further, and maybe it’ll make sense to you once I tell you my story.

In a small town deep in the woods of western New Hampshire, you will find where I reside. When I say small, I mean small. Almost all of our businesses are locally owned and everyone just about knows anyone. I’ve been here since I was little and have only left town to see friends and family. Otherwise, everything I need is perfectly in reach so I don’t see any point of even wanting to leave. For the sake of my people, I will not be sharing much more about our little settlement. It’s perfectly quiet and peaceful around here and that’s the way we want to keep it. Which is why, for as long as we can remember, my people have been trying to get to the bottom of a strange mystery deep in our town’s history. What’s that mystery you ask? Why I’ll tell you… but only if you believe will it even make an ounce of sense to you.

People are going missing, and have been for a long time. We have about 500 people living in our town, and every year 24 go missing. That number is only for people who we as the town believe were kidnapped by “the little men”, but we do have cases where people are found. The little men are a story that parents have made up to scare kids and keep them from running off into the woods and listening to strangers. I think it’s all made up, but like Santa, I don’t even think the parents will even admit it’s fake for our sake.

From this point on, all these events and conversations are real and genuinely happened. If you choose not to believe, then enjoy the spooky story. But if you do believe in such stories, then I advise you to listen closely and use my events to your own advantage. Be safe out there. You never know if stories like these may just save your life, or someone else’s.

“Sweetie, wake up. It’s time for school.” 
My mother spoke to me in her gentle, soft voice. “You don’t want to be late again baby.”

I don’t remember much during early mornings, but I will always remember my mother’s nurturing voice welcoming me into a new day. I sat up in bed and wiped the crust away from my eyes before heading down the hall to greet my dad in the kitchen.

This was the day that it would all start to change. My view on this town I called home, my safety, my comfort, anything I thought was or could be real, all would transform on that fateful walk after school.

“Hey dad.” I said, taking my seat at the table.

“How’d you sleep sport?” My dad replied, looking up from his newspaper. I don’t even know why he still reads those. We have the internet, so I guess it’s just a weird preference of his.

“I slept pretty well. I had one of those nightmares again, but honestly they don’t even faze me anymore.”

“I’m telling you boy, this town’s got something weird going on in the forest. Maybe not little men, but something most definitely.” He said sarcastically.

“Yeah. Sure dad.” I chuckled.

My mom shot him a jokingly dirty look.
Me and my dad don’t believe in that sort of stuff. Can’t say the same for my mom though.

I devoured my cereal and ran for the bus stop down the steep hill from my house. I turned around while running to see my mom blowing me a kiss from the front door of our cozy, one story home. I was so lucky to have an amazing mother like her. Me and my dad are close, but I doubt anyone will ever beat the relationship between this mother and her baby boy.

Once in my home room, I sat next to my friend Patrick and we started having our typical small talk.

“Bro did you hear? Valentina went missing! I’m telling you it’s those damn Pukwudgies man.” Patrick said in his monotone hippie voice. “I’m telling ya, they’re real. You have one of those visions again?”

I rolled my eyes and responded, “Yeah I had one of my NIGHTMARES again. Same dealio as always. I’m just standing at the edge of the woods across my house and there’s leaves blowing around everywhere.”

“Were, like, the voices there again? Or is it just the leaves and stuff.”

“No voices this time.”

“Damn man. That’s my favorite part! All that creepy shit they say, y’know?”

Before our conversation could go on any further, our teacher, Ms.Baker, called for our attention.

“Good morning class! As some of you may have heard- Franklin stop talking! Do I have to move you? No? Good. As I was saying, some of you may have heard about Valentina’s disappearance. If any of you hear or see anything, please report it to a trusted adult so they may notify the authorities. She was last seen in her backyard around 6:30 pm last Friday. I better not hear any jokes being made, or I’m sending you to the principal’s office immediately. You know how this goes.”

I doubt Franklin would listen to that last part. He doesn’t take anything seriously and is honestly kind of a douchebag.

Later at lunch, when I was sitting with Patrick, Franklin and a few of his buddies decided to come over and have a word with me.

“You one of those freaks that have those silly wet dreams about leaves?” He said in a mocking tone.

“Uhhhh. Where did you hear that?” I looked over at Patrick who made a sizzling sound in his mouth with his teeth together and eyes squinting.

“My bad man. I thought Trisha wouldn’t tell anybody.”

“Hah! You guys are losers.” Franklin snared at us with his goons laughing behind him almost robotically.

“It’s just a dream man. I don’t believe in that paranormal crap.” I said defending myself. Patrick must have been offended because he responded to that by punching me in the shoulder. “Ah what the fuck? Sorry, I meant to say I don’t believe in that paranormal STUFF.”

“Yeah, sure. Whatever losers. You tell those voices everyone hears that I said hi now.” He chuckled, walking away and taking his sheep with him.

“If it’s ‘crap’, then why does everyone on your street have the same dream?!” Patrick exclaimed defensively.

I rolled my eyes as the bell rang. Time to rap up the day with some 8th grade math and science. 

At the time, it was early November. It had just started to get dark and cold earlier. School ended at 2:30, but me and Patrick stayed after school to play Boss Monster at game club. Don’t get me wrong, I have a decent imagination, but that doesn’t mean I had to believe that paranormal stuff was real. By the time we had our fun and game club was over, it was 5pm. That, plus being the last bus stop at a middle school where everyone goes to, I was at my stop at around 5:35ish.

I stepped off the bus and immediately was no longer under the protection of the warm heat the bus driver had turned on for us. In a desperate attempt to not be late for school again, I had completely forgotten to bring my winter jacket for my walk home. I crossed my arms and put my hands under my armpits to keep myself warm. Looking up the steep hill, I could see the light coming from my house all the way at the top, but not the house itself. All the other houses’ porch lights were off because the kids that lived there were in high school and got dismissed at 1:50. 

So I was all alone, cold, and in the dark since my town refuses to add damn street lights to this road. As my bus drove off, I sighed, watching the air mystify right in front of me. I started my journey up the hill only hoping my mother made her signature warm chicken and noodle soup. Damn… I could only imagine how Valentina must've been feeling in this weather right now.

About halfway up the hill, I could make out the roof of my house, when all of a sudden whatever breeze there was had stopped. It took me a second to realize, but I wasn’t even cold anymore either. If anything I felt quite warm. Before I could fully process it, I saw something that stopped me dead in my tracks. There were a bunch of yellow and orange leaves dancing around in the nonexistent wind. It was just like the dreams people on this street have had; like the dream I had. Not only could I not feel the wind, I couldn’t hear it either. In fact, I couldn’t hear anything. No animals waking in the moonlight, no people in their homes, nothing at all. You know the saying “you could hear a pin drop”? It was like that, but in my case all I did hear was the sounds of the leaves moving and crumpling around in unison.

“Well that’s weird.” I spoke to myself aloud, almost to see if I was even conscious.

Unfolding my arms, I started walking again. My attention was once again focused on getting home. That’s when I heard it.

“Shaun”

I froze and snapped my attention towards the leaves that were still spiraling around unnaturally. I could have sworn that the wind just gusted my name. More disturbed than before, I started walking faster up the hill. The wind kept getting louder and louder, chasing after me along with the swarm of leaves.

“SHAUN”

I broke into a full on sprint. I was now certain someone was calling my name.

“SHAUN”

“Leave me alone!”

“SHAUN!”

“Mom!”

“SHAUN!!”

“Stop it please! Mom!” I cried desperately.

I was only a couple yards away from my front door at this point. The leaves had caught up to me and were sweeping around my feet. I burst through my front door, tackling mom in the process. My father slammed the door behind me. 

Cradling me, my mom cried out, “Oh my god! What’s wrong baby?”

“S-Someone was chasing me.” The words barely could leave my mouth.

“Chasing you?” She asked concerningly.

My dad sped over to our fireplace, unmantling his rifle from the wall and loaded it with a snap. He then ran back over to the front door, swung it open, and aimed his ruffle up.

“Whoever’s there, leave my son alone, ya hear me?!”

The rest of my parents’ night was spent calming me down and cheering me up. My dad would occasionally check outside all the windows and make sure that no one could get in. My mom made a delicious cookie dough and peanut butter sundae, and we sat and watched our show together. 

At one point in the night, I looked out the open curtain and across our street. There, at the edge of the forest, a swirling spiral of leaves elegantly danced as if calling out to me again. I said nothing and only stared. I had enough time to think about what had happened. It’s like my dream had come to life, but being the skeptic I am, it took me time to process it and all I could think was that someone was after me. But now, seeing the leaves sway and swirl, I wasn’t scared anymore. I know I wasn’t crazy, so how could something like that happen? My fear had become curiosity. And that curiosity, would indeed turn out to be as dangerous as you’d assume.

I never talked to Patrick at school about the leaves or anything out of the ordinary about that night. He, along with everyone else at school, thought I had run into who or whatever has been kidnapping people left and right. My dad reported what happened to our neighbors as well as the police. Ever since, whispers of what had happened spread like fire through my school. And you know what that means…

“Watch out Shaun! The little guys are after you!” Franklin yelled to me in the hallway after passing me between classes.

“Mellow him out man. He’d be shitting his pants if that happened to him.” Patrick said while holding the door to our next class open for me.

“Yeah I try. Honestly, nothing he says can affect me. I know deep down he’s just a mouth breathing turd.” I spiritedly replied as we laughed and took our seats.

“All right class, settle down now.” Our history teacher said in his booming, but calm southern drawl.

The sounds of our lesson on ancient Egypt blurred as my mind wandered. All I could think about were the leaves. Their motion wasn’t hypnotic or aggressive by any means, but instead brought a peaceful yet sorrowful feel to my gut. Why were they calling for me? And if people have had the same dream as I, did they also encounter the same thing? I needed answers.

When I got to my stop, my mom was there waiting for me.

“Hello, Mrs.Quiver!” My bus driver waved to my mom.

“Hi Frank! How’s Samantha and the new guy doing?”

“Oh good. They’re both doing great.”

“Oh nice! So happy for you two.”

“Aww. Well I’ll have to tell her you said that.”

“Tell her to ring me up. Haven’t heard from her since she left on maternity leave.”

“Will do. You have a good one now.”

“You too Frank. You too.” My mother said waving goodbye to Frank as he drove off. She then turned her attention towards me. “How was school honey?”

“It was good. Wish game club was today though.” Since the game club was only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I was home at around 3:15 today. It’s been a week and three days since the incident, and not for a moment did I let it slip my mind. “Hey mom?” I asked while we started walking up the sidewalk. “You believe in paranormal activity right?”

“You know it. Why, what’s up?”

“You remember that night where someone was chasing me home?”

“How can I forget something like that? Heck, I probably never will. Scared me to death hearing you scream for help like that.”

“Yeah well, don’t tell anyone, but I’m not so sure there even was a person that night.”

“What do you mean?” Her head turned as she gazed upon me concerningly.

“Well… God this is going to sound so stupid. I was walking up the hill when the wind stopped and it got kind of cozy outside. Then I saw a bunch of leaves dancing around on the street and… it was just like my nightmares mom.” I started crying a little bit. 

For as long as I can remember, I was never much scared of anything. I knew that the monsters I saw in movies weren’t real and couldn’t hurt me. But this? This was different. This was unnatural and I couldn’t explain how something like that could have happened. My mom stopped both of us and kneeled down so she was just under my eye level. She just looked upon me with sorrowful eyes and put her arms out offering a hug. I fell into her arms and just cried. 

“I don’t know what happened mom. I- I can’t explain it.”

“Some things in this world may never have answers sweetie. All that matters is that you’re safe now and it won’t happen again. Not as long as I'm here.”

We just stayed there and hugged for a good while. It took the cold creeping on us to break our arms’ bond around each other. We started trekking home again, and once inside, never told my dad about it. It was me and my mom’s little secret.

Despite all the search parties, it’s still been weeks and Valentina has never been found. As a matter of fact, her dad had gone missing recently as well. Unlike Valentina, he was found. Police say that Valentina’s dad had been having paranoid episodes where he’d see his daughter at the edge of the forest. Maybe he just broke. Losing a child can’t be easy. 

The body was found in the backyard of his own home, riddled with puncture marks and foaming at the mouth. The doctors who must have performed the autopsy chocked it up to a paranoia induced suicidal overdose. All I could think about though was how alone the widowed mother must be feeling. No husband, and no daughter. It was like her whole world must have been swallowed whole. I heard a scoff sound from a desk across the room. It was Franklin. I could vaguely hear him whispering to his friends.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if Val’s mom killed herself at this point.” Subtle chuckles could be heard that made me feel sick. I can only hope life comes to bite you on the ass you sick freak. 

I turned my attention back towards Patrick who was still yapping about how excited he was for game club this afternoon. At this point I didn’t need my mom to wait for me at the stop anymore. I decided that the incident with the leaves would just end up being some spooky story I’d tell to my kids. An event that most likely wouldn’t repeat itself. I was wrong.

We’re almost all caught up. The next few events that happened only an hour ago, are where things start to get impossibly complicated and strange. This entry is already long as is, so I’ll save it for tomorrow. I had a very long and confusing night and would really like to sleep on it. I’ll continue writing my story as soon as I get home tomorrow. Until I proof read and post it, I hope to hear from anyone that has thoughts on what I’ve told so far. It’d be nice to know that me and my mom aren’t alone in this. I’m even thinking of telling Patrick tomorrow about what happened. Heck, I might just have him read this. He better not go yapping about it though. Last thing I need is Franklin on my ass again. 

Until next time.
