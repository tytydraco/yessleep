 

As I walk through the school hall, I feel like I'm the only one here. Everyone else is in their own little groups, talking and laughing. I feel like an outsider, like I don't belong.

I look around, but nothing catches my eye. The walls are plain and the floor is dull. There's nothing interesting here. I keep walking, my footsteps echoing off the walls.

I pass by a few groups of people, but they don't even notice me. I'm just another face in the crowd. I feel invisible, like no one even knows I exist.

I keep walking, my head down and my hands in my pockets. I'm just trying to get through this day without being noticed. I don't want to draw any attention to myself.

I had been hearing voices in my head for weeks now, but this time it was different. The voices were louder and more insistent. I could feel them in my head, like a buzzing that wouldn't go away. I tried to ignore the voices, but they kept getting louder and more insistent. I stopped in the middle of the hallway, looking around to make sure no one was watching me. I closed my eyes and tried to focus on the voices, trying to make out what they were saying.

It was a deep, commanding voice that said, "Take a sh\*t in your best friend's backpack." I was taken aback by the suggestion and immediately dismissed it. I knew it was wrong and I had no intention of following through with it.

"You must do as I say or you will suffer the consequences." I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized what was happening. The voice persisted. It kept repeating the same phrase "Take a sh\*t in your best friend's backpack." over and over again, growing louder and more insistent with each repetition. I tried to ignore it, but it was impossible. I felt like I was being pulled in two directions, and I was starting to feel overwhelmed. Finally, I gave in. I took a deep breath and walked inside the class.

The classroom was silent as everyone worked diligently on their assignments. Suddenly, a loud, unmistakable sound filled the room. It was the sound of someone taking a sh\*t. Everyone turned to see who it was, and to their horror, they saw that it was me.

The entire class was silent, and I could feel everyone's eyes on me. I was embarrassed and ashamed of my actions .

I can't believe I did this. I'm running away from class. I can feel my heart pounding in my chest as I sprint out of the classroom and down the hallway. I can hear the teacher calling after me, but I don't stop. I keep running until I'm out of the school and into the safety of the street. I take a few moments to catch my breath and try to calm down. I know I have to go back eventually, but for now I just need to get away.

I was walking home from school, feeling a little bit guilty about what I had done. I had taken a sh\*t in my friend's backpack!, and I knew I was going to get in trouble for it.

 When I got home, my dad was waiting for me. I was so embarrassed as I stood there in front of my dad, feeling the heat of his anger radiating off of him. He had just gotten off the phone with my school principal, who had informed him of my latest misdeed.

 My dad was livid. He was shouting at me, telling me how disappointed he was in me and how I had embarrassed him and our family. He said that he had worked hard to build a good reputation for us, and that I had just thrown it away with my childish behavior. I wanted to explain myself, to tell him that it was just a joke and that I hadn't meant any harm, but I knew it wouldn't make a difference. He was too angry to listen.

  Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my dad stopped yelling and just looked at me and said, "Go to your room and stay there until I say otherwise." I nodded, feeling ashamed and embarrassed. I knew I had messed up.

 I open the door to my room and take a deep breath. It's been a long day and I'm ready to relax. I take a few steps in and take in the familiar sight of my room. My bed is made, my desk is neat, and my bookshelf is full of books. I can't help but smile. This is my sanctuary. I walk over to my bed and lay down.

Suddenly, I hear a voice in my head. It's faint, but it's there. "What do you want?" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. The voice doesn't answer, but I can feel its presence. I can feel it watching me, waiting for me to speak. "What do you want from me?" I ask again, this time a little louder. The voice still doesn't answer, but I can feel it getting closer. I can feel its presence in the room, like a presence that can't be seen but can be felt. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. I focus on the voice, trying to make out what it's saying. "I want you to be happy," the voice finally says. I was taken aback by the voice's response.

I had expected it to be angry or dismissive, but it was neither.

The voice was silent again, then it said, "You must steal your father's car and go meet me in the forest". "Why do I need to do this?" I ask the voice. The voice responds, "It is the only way. Do not hesitate, do it now!"

I'm lying in bed, my mind racing with ideas. I can't believe I'm actually considering stealing my dad's car. I know it's wrong, but I'm desperate. I glance at the clock. It's almost midnight. I know my dad will be asleep by now, so I should be able to get away with it. I take a deep breath and get out of bed. I'm going to do this. I crept out of my room and down the stairs.

My dad kept his car keys in the top drawer of his desk, so i snuck into his office and opened the drawer. I grabbed the keys and quickly ran out of the room, feeling a rush of adrenalin. I was shaking with excitement and fear as I opened the garage door.

I had never driven a car before, but I figured it couldn't be too hard. I got in the driver's seat. I turned the key in the ignition and the engine roared to life. I was off! I slowly put my foot on the gas pedal and the car started to move.

I was driving down the highway, my hands gripping the steering wheel tightly as I tried to focus on the road ahead. Suddenly, a voice in my head spoke up, startling me. "Turn left at the next intersection," it said. "Turn left," it repeated, this time with more urgency. My heart raced as I slowly turned the wheel, following the voice's instructions.

I glanced in the rearview mirror, expecting to see someone following me, but there was no one there. The voice continued to guide me, telling me when to turn and when to speed up. I felt like I was in a trance, unable to control my own actions.

 Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the voice stopped. I pulled over to the side of the road, my hands shaking. I had no idea where I was or how I had gotten there. All I knew was that I had been driven there by a mysterious voice in my head.

I stepped out of the car and were immediately surrounded by a thick fog that seemed to be coming from nowhere. I looked around but couldn't see more than a few feet in front of me.

I was walking through the forest, feeling the cool breeze on my skin and the crunch of the leaves beneath my feet. Suddenly, I heard a voice in my head. It was deep and menacing, and it said, "Go deeper into the forest. You will find what you seek." I hesitated, feeling a chill run down my spine. I wanted to turn around and run away, but something compelled me to keep going.

The voice in my head kept talking, guiding me through the trees. It told me to turn left, then right, then left again. I followed its instructions, feeling a strange sense of dread as I went.

 Finally, I reached a clearing in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a large, ancient temple. The voice in my head said, "This is the way. Go inside and you will find what you seek." I can feel the power emanating from the structure, as if it has been here for centuries. I take a few steps closer and run my hand along the cold stone. I can almost feel the history of the temple, and I'm filled with a sense of reverence.

I took a deep breath and stepped inside.
