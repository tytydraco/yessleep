When I was a little girl, my parents’ marriage hit a bumpy patch, and I went to live with my grandmother for a few weeks while they took a holiday together to “work things out.” This was all happening over winter break, which meant a Christmas spent out at her house in the mountains with no friends or electronics to distract me. 

Despite it all, I didn’t complain. Though I was only eight, I was smart enough to realize this was no time to be petulant. 

My grandmother was a woman everyone described as “severe.” She’d moved to the U.S. from Germany for college, studying some obscure branch of mathematics, and spoke with a heavy accent. In her retirement, she’d moved to the middle of nowhere, where she spent her days scribbling complex lists of numbers. 

Though she said she was happy to have me, she displayed no evidence to bolster such a claim. After setting me up in a spare room crowded with arcane texts, she informed me that meals would be at sunup, noon, and sunrise. Then she retreated to her study, where I soon heard the scratching of pencil on paper.

I spent my first few days at my grandmother’s house reading and rereading a few Boxcar Children novels that I’d hurriedly packed, then scoured the house for more material and found only shelf after shelf of math books and Danielle Steele novels, which I struggled to understand much less enjoy.

Then, on the third day, a massive blizzard hit. 

Growing up in San Francisco, I’d only seen snow maybe once or twice, and certainly never at this scale. That afternoon, as great lumpy flakes began to fall, I sprinted outside, not even thinking to grab a coat, and opened my mouth wide trying to catch one on my tongue. It didn’t take long, and the texture was soft and unexpected. I ate another and another. 

For a moment, the knot of worries that had haunted me for the last few months began to fade. I stopped thinking about my mom and dad’s screaming matches and the hole he’d punched in the kitchen wall. I forgot the terrible words they’d called each other, and my dad’s promises to kill himself if my mother left him. It was all gone, replaced with the soft texture of the melting snow.

Before I knew it, the ground grew white all around me, and I realized I myself was covered in flakes, and shivering. When I ran inside to get a coat, I found my grandmother waiting for me.

“Delicious, isn’t it?” she asked.

I didn’t know quite how to react. She’d barely said two words to me since I’d arrived.

“I was just playing.”

“Before you go out again, there’s something I should probably tell you,” she said. “It’s something my grandmother told me as a child that’s always stayed with me.”

She gestured to a chair beside the hearth, where she’d set a roaring fire going. I sat, and soon the snow on my hair and shoulders began to melt, the drips running down my neck. 

“What I’m about to tell you, is the absolute truth. A law of the universe as immutable as gravity or to the speed of light. Within every snowstorm is a single drop of death,” she said, offering me a mug of cocoa. “Only a single flake amongst the billions that fall. Out of all of those, one is marked with an absolute curse to kill anything it comes in contact with.”

I looked at her, slightly confused. For a moment, I wondered if there was some kind of language barrier, making her say something she didn’t mean. But it seemed unlikely. Despite her thick accent, my grandmother was precise with her vocabulary.

She continued: “Of course, human deaths of this kind are so rare that most people never realize. It’s statistically less likely than getting struck by lightning. Most of the time, that little piece of death simply falls harmlessly to the dirt. There’s only one per storm, after all. Maybe the snowflake kills a blade of grass and no one notices.”

“Once though, when I was a girl in Dresden, I was walking home and saw a red deer standing in the snow. It was looking at me walk by, as they often do. And then suddenly, the little string connecting its soul to its body just snapped all at once, and it fell over dead. Just like that. And I knew I’d seen it catch the one, deadly snowflake.”

“Of course, I wouldn’t expect anyone else to believe any of this. I’ve actually been spending the last several years attempting a mathematical proof. I have it nearly solved for storms of over a certain numerical threshold, say, close to fifteen billion or more snowflakes, but with a bit more time I’m hoping to generalize–well, never mind, I suppose this is all a bit too academic for you.”

For a while, we both started into the fire. I realized I was shaking, as if I’d just escaped something dangerous–an encounter with a predator or a near-fatal car accident. 

“I won’t go out anymore,” I said. “I didn’t realize it bothered you.”

“Don’t be dense,” she said. “You should go out. You need to go out. I simply wanted you to be informed. We should always know the possible consequences of our actions.”

“I guess I don’t understand.”

She stirred her cocoa and sipped. 

“I was just trying to explain why the snow tastes so sweet,” she said. 

I did not go out in the snow again. I disappeared back into my books. At night, I dreamed that the roof had collapsed and swirling snow was falling on me unimpeded. I saw the cord of my soul snapping like a violin string that had been plucked too hard. 

I woke up sweating. Outside, the snow continued to fall and pile, each flake could have been the deadly one for all I knew. I huddled closer in my comforter, afraid of snow, afraid of everything, never wanting to go outside again.

I don’t remember too much more of the trip. A week or so later, my parents came back from their vacation suntanned and glowing. About a year later, my sister Erin was born, and though the fights continued the talk of divorce never came up again. 

For me, though, the effects of that vacation were less positive. For years, I was haunted by recurring nightmares of snow: blizzards and avalanches. And also, sometimes of floating in a dark sea, unable to move, looking into the night sky and watching a single, deadly flake float down toward me.

In time, I began to fear rain too, certain that the same logic my grandmother had applied to snow carried over to other weather as well. When it stormed, I’d come up with excuse after excuse not to go outside, sometimes screaming that I wouldn’t go to school or over to a friend’s house if it meant risking being hit by a deadly raindrop.

Over the years, I missed birthdays, school trips, days in the park. All to stay safe and home. And dry.

My grandmother passed a decade after that in the very living room where she’d told me the story. She died in the summer on one of the hottest days of the year, but it was winter by the time we made it up to her house to sort through her things. 

While my parents looked through dresser drawers for hidden jewelry, Erin and I carefully packed dishes downstairs. I was just wrapping up one of grandma’s mugs when I looked outside and realized it was snowing. 

Erin was maybe nine or ten at that point. I was eighteen. She had never seen snow before, and before I could stop her, she ran outside into the sea of swirling flakes.

“Stop,” I screamed. “Stop!”

But she wasn’t listening. Out the window, I watched as she opened her mouth, a look of pure rapture on her face. For a moment, my whole body tensed, ready to watch her die just like the deer in my grandmother’s story.

But she didn’t.

The flakes fell harmlessly all around her. They landed on her tongue and she yelped with joy.

I walked to the door and looked out at her.

“Come out,” she said.

“You know I can’t,” I said. “I can’t.”

“You’ve got to taste it,” she said. “It feels awesome when it melts on your tongue!”

“I can’t,” I said again, and I realized I was weeping, shaking in fear. “I can’t. I’ll die.”

“You won’t die,” she said, smiling, trying to be kind. “Well, you might die of boredom if you stay inside.”

Then she turned and went running off into the storm, disappearing behind the veil of white. For a moment, I watched her. The wind blew, and a few flakes landed on my jacket. I looked down at them. None had killed me.

“Come on,” Erin shouted. “Live a little!”

For a moment, I just stood there frozen. And then she called again and, following the sound of her voice, I stepped out of the house into the cold, uncertain [white of the world.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)
