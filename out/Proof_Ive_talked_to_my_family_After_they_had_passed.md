Hi everyone, I've been interested in the Paranormal since I was a kid. 

One day I was sitting with my grandmother and we were watching a TV show. We were talking about death and how some people believe their family members who have passed away are doing things to let them know they're okay, sending signs, moving things, sometimes even hearing them speak. so she mentioned to me that day that if she could, she would let me know somehow that she's okay on the other side. I remember a look of seriousness on her face. 

Fast forward a couple years later she passes away and three months later my aunt unexpectedly passes.. so this really was a rough time for me and I thought back, rewinding all the memories I have of them, and I had remembered about what my grandmother said ... 

so I bought an sb7 Spirit Box.. It's a device that just scans radio frequencies, or stations.. Anywhere from 5 to 12 stations every second.. So what you hear is just the feed back, or white noise from switching stations so fast... 

and for a month before they lost the house I did weekly sessions there and I can't tell you how much I  caught there.. Some Nights there was nothing the whole night just static White Noise no voice nothing and other nights I would catch direct responses to my questions every couple of minutes. The white noise from the spirit box is said to make it easier for people who have passed to communicate.. I recorded on a digital voice recorder Over 70 direct responses to  questions, talking in the quiet of night with no devices, and I'd like to show you three items that I recorded that night.. If you have headphones use them while listening to these for the best quality 

now if you want to guess what they're saying don't look at the bottom because I listed what they say and at what times in the clips. I put them through audio software and isolated the vocals from each clip they all have their own independent wavelength and are definitely vocal tones 

When my friends have family members that passed, after they mourn they always contact me to come to their house for a spirit box session and every single person has had an experience that helped them in one way or another 

the one with what I believe to be my grandmother, the first one you're going to hear you'll hear me scream after I heard something come out of the spiritbox. I screamed, and it was almost like the wind got knocked out of me bc at that moment I heard the voice I felt the biggest bolt of electricity that went right from the arm holding the device through my whole body... it's a weird feeling.. if it's ever happened to you it's a very unique feeling and I'll never forget it as long as I live..I also smelled white diamonds at the same exact time which was the perfume my grandmother wore. I'll never forget what was said either because all of these make very much sense within the context of what we asked or were talking about at the time 

If you're a skeptic this might change your mind and if your a believer that says it's a demon in disguise I believe you to be wrong, and we can talk about that subject any day. I'm a Christian. I don't know how it works but somehow I believe I talked to my loved ones who have passed. I heard them, and most I importantly I felt them, and even smelled them at the moment voices came through 

It's like you know when you're in the same room with someone who loves you who you've known your whole life and at this moments I felt that 

. I hope you all appreciate this it's a very very beautiful thing I have here so enjoy! :-)
