I would like to preface, I do not want to move. Rent here is cheap and I am willing to put up with his bullshit as long as I can stay here for the amount I am paying.

As the title says, my roommate is a reddit moderator. I'm not sure how he pays for it, since I haven't seen him leave the apartment once. He won't even take the trash out, he just waits till I do it, no matter how many times I've asked. Most of the garbage is his too! He doesn't know how to cook so he just orders doordash for every meal. Almost daily I find some fast food boxes taking up a quarter of the trashcan. 

There's also the fact I don't think this guy has even heard of clorox. Now I'm not the cleanest person, but once a week clean is all I ask. The amount of times we've gotten ants because his den is filthy is just ridiculous. 

Most conversations usually just go, “Hey Tyler, can you clean the bathroom, I'm running late for class,”

“Hmm… sorry can't right now, some normie didn't read rule 43 on proper posting syntax … fucking idiots never know the rules, tenth loser I've had to ban today,” 

“It would take less than ten minutes,”

“Oh my god, fine! Stop being so toxic dude!”

Then when I get back, the bathroom is unclean, and his door is locked while the distant sounds of a mechanical keyboard and him screaming about League of Legends can be heard.

Oh and god forbid you step on any of his ridiculous rules. He has a small whiteboard with “Rules of the Land” written at the top.

Rule #1: Do not disturb me after 11pm

Rule #2: Do not set temp under 75°

Rule #3: No flowers or floral fragrances

Rule #4: ABSOLUTELY NEVER LEAVE SALT OUT!!!!!!!

Weird ass rules, but fine, rent is cheap so I follow them. The worst one is the floral one because brother doesn't wash. He just sits around and gets sweaty. I have told him to shower before and all he did was shrug and say “Females love pheromones,”

There was this one time when I finished making eggs for breakfast, and left my salt shaker on the counter. Tyler literally shrieked when he came into the kitchen. Dude just pointed at it and let out a noise that no man in his thirties should make. It was like the mixture of a pissed off toddler and a chicken being attacked by a coyote.

“What the fuck is wrong with you!?” He yelled.

I was sitting at the table, forgetting about the rule, “What?” I asked, completely dumbfounded.

“Erm, the salt you idiot! Can't you follow one basic rule you pleb?” His mouth had a fine circle of cheeto dust around it.

“No need to be insulting man, I'll put it away when I'm done eating,” 

He huffed then yelled, “Oh my God, can't you fucking do anything right!” Then he waddled back into his room. 

All of that was my first month there. I have lived here for about seven months now. Most days of the week I don't see him, which I am fine with. My main problem is I started dating this girl from my Chemistry Lab, and she wanted to stop by my place. Her name is Chelsea, and she is way out of my league. She is cute, way smarter than me, and has the dumbest sense of humor. I have no idea why the hell she is with me, but hey, two months without any problems.

That was until one night, “Hey Trey, I really want to talk to you about something serious,” she said sitting in a booth seat right across from me at a cheap Chinese place. She smelt like Lavender and honey suckle.

Now my blood ran cold, straight fear that she was about to end things, “yeah sweetheart, what's wrong?” sweat pooled on my back.

Her hands cupped mine, “listen I really like you, but I feel like you've been keeping something from me. Every time I ask about going to your place, you come up with some excuse. Why?”

The brief relief from her not ending things quickly turned to nervousness about telling her why she's never been, “Well… it's just that… it's hard to explain,”

“What is? Do you have a weird jacking off corner to anime girls or a shrine to Andrew [redacted]?” Her tone was trying to sound playful, but there was a real fear of that in her voice.

“No no no… nothing like that. It's my roommate,” I paused and thought about what to say, “he's just a bit much.”

She then laughed, “What? Is he an incel or something?”

“Oh no,” I then thought for a moment, “well maybe. He's a reddit moderator.”

Her laugh then became louder and she snorted, “noooooo. Like the fedora m'lady type of guy?”

“Okay maybe not that bad… but anime figurines and a balding ponytail,” I laughed too.

“Nooooo dude stop. Thats just funny, but that doesn't stop me from wanting to go by your place,” 

“I don't know, the place overall is fine, just my room is the only place that doesn't smell musky,”

She then leaned forward with a mischievous grin, “maybe we could watch a movie in your room then,”

My eyes widened at the underlying tone, “Can't we just go back to your dorm?”

Her eyes stayed pressed on mine, “oh I was thinking tonight we might need more privacy, don't want my roommate coming back early.”

In that moment the wrong head made the decision, “alright, but do not think any lesser of me if Tyler comes out,” 

She sat back with a victorious smile, “no promises,” 

We finished up dinner and practically ran to my car. The drive back to my place started smooth, till I had the realization that he might actually come out to introduce himself. Once back at my apartment complex I pulled out my phone and quickly texted him.

10:04 pm: Hey, I have company coming by… think u can stay in ur room for a little while when we come up?

Before I could even put my phone in my pocket and turn the car off I heard it buzz.

10:04 pm: Do you have a lady friend coming over? 

My face must of shown my disgust because Chelsea asked what's wrong,

“Just my roommate being weird.”

10:07 pm: Just pls stay in ur room

10:07 pm: Hmm. We will see.

I turn the key and put my phone away, “We can just go back to your dorm, or go see a movie at a theater,” I tried to find a way out.

“We're already here,” she leaned over and gave me a peck on the cheek, “and at most we'll just pass your roommate if he comes out,” 

Before I could say anything she got out of the car. I followed her, eventually taking the lead as we went up the stairs. We made it back to the front door of my apartment.

“If you want to leave at any point just let me know,” I said as I unlocked the door.

“Baby, it's fine, your roommate isn't going to ruin things between us,” she said behind me.

I pushed the door open slowly, and all the lights were out. The light from the hallway made a stretching rectangle cutting through the dark void of the living room. 

“Fuck its humid in here,” Chelsea said stepping in behind me. 

“Yeah, sorry he likes to keep it warm for some reason,” I said and flicked the switch on the wall. 

We both jumped back and she grabbed my arm.

“Well, well, well. Look at what the cat dragged in,” Tyler said sitting in a wooden chair he must've moved from the kitchen to right in front of the door, “and who's the lovely lady?” 

He was drenched in sweat, with his greasy balding hair pulled back into a ponytail. He wore a black ‘Demonslayer’ graphic Tee. His face had a tiny mustache, but his neck was filled with small curling hairs. 

“What the fuck Tyler? Have you been waiting for us?” my voice didn't hide my anger.

For some reason he just started slow clapping. When finished he pushed his glasses up with his pinky, “oh I just wanted to be a good host for our ‘company’,” he smiled showing off his yellow teeth, “so I'll ask again. Who's the lovely lady?”

Chelsea just laughed behind me from how awkward the situation was, unable to hold it in anymore, “I'm Chelsea, and you must be Tyler,”

I looked at her in a way to tell her I don't want to drag this out, but she gave me a “fuck it,” look with a cock of her neck and smirk.

He grinned, “indeed I am, indeed I am. I'm sure Trey has told you all about me,”

“Oh for sure,” she said with a smile and looked at me, “he mentioned you like anime.”

His eyes light up, “oh yeah, do you?”

“Some, I watched studio ghibli movies growing up,” she said with a friendly tone.

“Oh those are so basic, I watched ‘Berserk’ as a kid cause it was all I could relate to,” he said in a smug voice.

“Good for you man,” I interjected, “well I think we are just going to go and watch a movie,” 

“Oh let me guess, some normie film like ‘Avengers’ or ‘Star Wars’,” he said with a scoff.

“Sure man,” I said, pulling Chelsea past him.

“Well you too have fun, and don't be too loud,” he winked, and I physically crunched up in disgust. We make it to my bedroom and I usher her inside. Once the door closed we both looked at each other and started laughing.

“Holy shit dude, you fucking undersold how bad he is,” Chelsea said holding her hand to her mouth.

“No, no, no, no, no. I gave you plenty of warning and opportunity to back out, you're the one who asked him about anime,” I said in a false annoyed voice.

“Well, did you hear how cool he was when he was a kid?” her voice then went nasally, “ooohhh you know, I watched ‘Berserk’ cause I was cool,” she sat back on the bed.

I grabbed the remote to my TV, “well, guess we should watch our ‘normie film’,” I said, falling back next to her. 

“Hmm, well our options are ‘Avengers’ or ‘Star Wars’,” she nudged me, “what are you thinking?”

“How about a horror movie? Been really wanting to watch ‘Scream’ recently,” I answered honestly.

“I don't know, don't think I'm in the mood for a movie with a creepy greasy guy killing people,” she said, falling back and laying her head on my chest, “how about a rom-com, like ‘How to lose a guy in 10 days’?”

“Sure… but can we do ‘10 things I hate about you’ instead?”

“You only hate ten things about me? You are down bad,” she teased, “yeah sure, never actually seen that one,”

“Really?” I responded surprised, “it's a classic!”

“Ugh, don't go all film bro on me dude, I actually like you, don't ruin it now,” her voice was dripping with sarcasm.

“No promises.”

So we watched the movie, without going into detail of what happened during. Afterwards we were lying in bed, “so that's based on ‘Taming of the shrew’?” She said, looking up at me.

“Yeah, definitely had to make it more modern though.” 

“Oh definitely,” she then stretched, “its so hot in here.”

“Yeah it is.”

She slapped my bare chest, “not like that asshole,” then she got out of bed and put on one of my t-shirts and a pair of gym shorts, “where's the thermostat? I can't sleep in this heat,”

I got on one arm, “oh Tyler doesn't like it being touched, he's weird about it,” 

She walked over to me and held my chin in her hand, “baby, I really don't care if Tyler is comfortable or not,” her lavender perfume filled my nose, “tell me where it's at, and pick out another movie while I'm gone,” she then gave me a kiss.

“Down the hall on the right, next to the bathroom,” I said like a confession.

She smiled, “you're cute when you're flustered,” then she turned and left the room. 

I grabbed my phone, 11:33 pm. The bathroom is right next to Tyler's room, but I didn't really think about it. I then started going through the different movies. After a while I felt the A/C come on, its cool air hitting my skin. 

“AHHHHHH!” I heard Chelsea scream from the hallway. Instantly I jumped out of bed, pulled jeans on and grabbed my phone. I turned the light on and looked down the hallway, “Baby!?” I called out. I shined the light to the end of the hall, but didn't see her. 

Running down the hall, “Chelsea!” I called, then my barefoot slipped on something. I fell down onto the ground. My head banged against the wooden floor. Looking down and shining my light I saw streaks of slime dripping off my foot.

“The fuck?” I muttered.

I got up and shined the light on the ground. There was a streak of slime running on the ground. Carefully I maneuvered around it, “Chelsea? Are you okay,” I said as I looked at the thermostat. It was back at 75°, but that slime dripped off the console.

The door to Tyler's room crept open slowly, “Trey,” I heard what sounded like Chelsea's voice, weak and hoarse.

I walked towards the door, the slime trail went directly into it. I pushed the door open, my light shined onto the ground. Chelsea was on the ground, her eyes frozen open. 

“Holy shit, Chelsea what happened,” I said kneeling down, but she seemed stuck in paralysis.

“Treyyyy,” I heard above me, when I looked up I saw Tyler on the ceiling, his stomach against the ceiling as his head was rotated in a full 180. Slime dripped from his face, right into my mouth.

Before I could say anything, a chitinous dart shot from his double chin. It stuck into my neck and I felt instantly woozy. Falling again I could only stare up and watch him slither. His eyes seemed to start protruding from his sockets. My eyes shut as his poison flowed through and knocked me out.

“Trey!” Chelsea's voice woke me up. I jumped awake, I instantly felt my arms and legs restrained in a wooden chair. There was struggling behind me. We had been tied back to back.

“Trey!” her voice broke through again, “please wake up!”

“Chelsea, what's happening?” I said half awake. Judging from the shadows we must have been in the living room.

“Look who's decided to join us,” Tyler's voice came from the darkness around us. My whole body was numb. I could smell his pungent body odor in the room

“What? What did you do to us?” I asked in a murmured voice, my jaw barely working.

“You thought you two could make fun of me, break my rules, and get away with it,” I could hear his mouth breathing from somewhere.

“Please just let me go!” Chelsea cried, “please, we didn't do anything!”

“Quite! Let the men talk, princess,” the sounds of what registered as an old wet mop moved around.

Chelsea immediately responded,“Fuck you asshole!”

“What did you hit us with?” I asked, now fully waking up.

“Just my love darts,” an audible smile was heard.

Chelsea yelled out a loud, “Oh fuck that!”

I wanted to throw up at just the words, “You're such a creepy pathetic loser,”

“Still looking down on me Trey, you think you're so great. Jocks like you always push guys like me around, thinking you're better than me,” wet sounds filled the room.

I felt an anger build up in my chest, “Stop with the sob story! The most I ever did was ask you to clean up after yourself and do chores. I barely know you, I didn't make you a neckbeard incel who spends all his time power tripping on Reddit cause you never learned any basic fucking life skills. So yes I do think I'm better than your self victimizing agoraphobic freak ass! So get some help and stop making it everyone else's problem!”

He didn't speak for a moment, “You'll regret being a rule breaker soon,” he sounded less confident.

He then flipped the lights on. In front of me was a revolting sight. His shoulders had sunk in, his neck now completely gone. His eyes protruded from stalks as his ‘demon slayer’ shirt had two small arms hanging out of the sleeves. His mouth was now circular. His legs were now gone, formed together into a long fat tail. Mucous covered his entire body. His body is still pale white as before.

“Behold my true form!” His small arms outstretched and he looked up. Somehow his hair was even greasier.

Chelsea screamed and fought against the bindings, “What the fuck is that!” 

He slowly inched his way towards me, his stench making me gag, “Oh what's wrong rommie? Regretting breaking my rules?”

“You're such a fucking loser,” I said averting my eyes and trying not to breathe in through my nose.

“Oh and you think you two are such a Chad and Stacy,” he scoffed, then his spit oozed from his mouth onto my hand, “I would say next time don't break the rules, but there won't be one,”

His mouth then wrapped around my hand, I began screaming as I felt the sensation of hundreds of grinding teeth slowly rip my hand apart. His still human eyes were at my level and looking right at me. The feeling of my fingers being destroyed by what felt like cheese shredders. The room spun as his teeth destroyed my hand and left a jagged bone. I screamed as the blinding pain went up my arm.

“No no no no, please God no!” Chelsea began to hyperventilate.

Tyler let go of my hand and laughed, “Uh. You believe in God, thats so fucking stupid to do that,”

I looked down and saw what was left of my hand. Just a bloody sharp bone sticking out. It hurt like absolute hell, my body shaking from the pain. 

Tyler laughed, “Don't worry darling, when I'm done with him you'll go next,”

With my hand now gone I was able to pull my arm free from the bindings. Adrenaline numbed the pain. Before Tyler could react I stabbed his side with my bone.

“What the hell!  What the Fuck! It hurts you dick!” He cried out while I stabbed a couple times.

“Chelsea rock the chairs!” I called over my shoulder. We rocked back and forth, when Tyler slowly moved towards us I jabbed at him.

We finally made the chairs fall to the ground, breaking them and releasing us. 

“Kitchen! Now!” 

We rushed over, as Tyler slowly moved across the living room and towards us. I threw my kitchen cabinet open, and pulled out the only thing I could think of.

Tyler's eyes widened, “Hey man, don't use that, I'm sorry okay, I just don't do good with women,”

The salt shaker was in my hand, I flung some at him. His spineless body wretched and hissed at the contact, “Get back Tyler!” I demanded. Chelsea was behind me and looking for more salt. She found an entire thing of iodized salt and tore it open.

“Cold water, get him to the bath!” Chelsea yelled, a plan already formulated in her head.

So we threw salt towards him, forcing him down the hallway, yelling at him to get into the bathroom. Hissing and small burning coming off his sluggish body.

“No please, I didn't mean it. Sorry, I'm sorry, but you did break the rules!” he cried once in the bathroom. Chelsea hit the thermostat till it hit the lowest number it could go. We threw more and more salt till he slithered into the tub.

“You two are just too low IQ! My intelligence makes you jealous,” he sneered. We laid salt on the edge of the tub, ensuring his capture. Then we hit the cold water.

“NOOOO!” he screeched.

We grabbed shampoo and body wash and poured it into the water with him, his body reeling against it. Chelsea ran back to the kitchen, grabbed the ice tray and rushed back.  We then dumped the rest of the salt into the tub till he was finally dead. His body became a sludge in the tub. We drained him after a while. Nothing was left, turns out he didn't have a bone in his body.

All of that was about a month ago. Chelsea and I are now official, killing a spineless slug-man incel is a great bonding experience. With a lot of bleach and scrubbing we were able to clean out Tyler's old room. I thought about moving out, but the rent is still cheap. The worst part about all of this is my insurance company won't cover for a prosthetic, so my left hand is now a stump. Oh and we got a sublet for Tyler's room, meeting them soon. 

Apparently the new guy is a podcaster, but hey it can't be any worse than my previous roommate, right?
