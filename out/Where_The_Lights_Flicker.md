  

 A week ago, my stepbrother was found dead. The coroners can’t find a cause, It was like his heart just… stopped. He was much older than me, so we didn’t talk much. My mom was always checking in with him, calling, texting, one of those moms.

That’s how she knew something was wrong. After two days of not answering her calls and ignoring her texts, she started to worry, so she drove over to his house which he hadn’t even owned for a month. And there she found him slumped over on the floor in his dining room, not breathing.

Sorry if I seem a bit detached, but as I mentioned, I never really knew him that well. After the funeral, we were advised to clear out all his stuff, which there wasn’t much of since he hadn’t even fully moved in yet. We brought over a few boxes and loaded his clothes and other belongings in them. We dropped them off in the storage unit we own and drove back to get the last of his things, and that trip was when I found his journal.

I decided to keep it without telling my parents since reading the journal could probably give me a little more insight into who he was. So when we got back home, I went up to my room and started reading. What I found in that book is the reason I’m copying it down here. I can’t explain it, and after showing it to my parents, they can’t explain it either. 

Whether I believe what he said was true and not some psychotic episode doesn’t matter now. I’m only here to write what I found. I have the journal with me here, so I’m Copying down what he wrote word for word. Here goes.

Finally, I’m here. After a lot of paperwork, I’ve finally moved into this house. Well, I only have a bed, my toiletries, and this book to keep me company, so as of the moment, not much. I’ll manage though. I’ll try to update this thing every night, but forgive me if I don’t, moving’s a lot of work. Anyway, I’m too tired to write any longer, so I’m clocking out.

\[This was his first entry, but it doesn’t get interesting for a bit. I’ll skip ahead a bit when the first few odd things start.\]

Ugh. I spent all day trying to fix the stupid light in the basement. It kept flickering on and off no matter if the switch was set to on or off. I spent all day looking up tutorials on how to fix it, but nothing worked. I’m too burnt out (pun not intended) to do anymore. I’m going to sleep.

January 12, 2023

Well, the basement light is fixed, but now the light in the kitchen is flickering. Same drill as yesterday. No luck. Maybe this is why that guy offered me such a low price for this place. I’m just going to ignore it and focus on moving more stuff in.

\[That’s what he did for the next few days, and the next entry where it’s mentioned again is on January 16\]

Ok, I thought this electricity problem was over, but now it’s expanded to every room. The living room light will flicker, then it’ll move to the kitchen, then the dining room, and back to the living room. It’s getting on my nerves. I’m calling an electrician to come check this out.

January 17, 2023

I was lucky he could come out today, but apparently business hasn’t been heavy, so he came out and inspected the lights. He tried everything I did, but no luck. He said he’d never seen anything like it. He checked the circuit breaker, troubleshooted, turned things off and on, but no luck. I’m not about to move out of this place just because of a few lights.

\[Again he kept ignoring the lights, but after a few days, something new happened.\]

I keep finding things knocked over or moved. I left my cup of coffee on the counter, and when I came back it was on top of the fridge. I heard a crash in my kitchen and found a glass bowl my mom gave me as a housewarming gift shattered on the floor. What the fuck is happening?

January 25, 2023

I’m moving out. I’m packing up my things and getting the FUCK out. I saw something. I’m not sleeping here another goddamn night. Ok, ok, Let me explain. I was going down to my kitchen to get some water and…

Something was there. I only saw it in flickers, since the flickering lights were obscuring it half the time, but I know what I saw.

It was hanging from the ceiling. It had all these dark threads that looked like hair, but they came out the back of this.. mask it was wearing. The mask looked like an aged human skull, but there were sunken, bloodshot eyes in the sockets.

I think it saw me too, because when we locked eyes, its tendrils whipped out and smashed the light, plunging the kitchen into darkness. I ran upstairs to my room, and here I am writing this. Now that I’ve written all this down, I’m taking my stuff and driving back over to my parent’s house.

\[This is the last entry.\]

To get to his garage, he had to pass through the kitchen, so whatever was there probably got him. I’ve shown this to the police, and they don’t know what to make of it. I showed this to my parents, and they think he suffered some mental breakdown before he died which only made them even more depressed.

So that’s why I’m writing this here. I want more opinions on what really happened to my stepbrother. But I also want people to know what happened to me. What I mean by that is, ever since we left my stepbrother’s house, 

the light in our living room won't stop flickering
