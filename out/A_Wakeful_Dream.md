I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, counting cracks, and feeling the pulse of time in my temples. The clock beside me ticks away with deliberate precision, each second mocking me. Sleep, an elusive wraith, hovers just beyond reach. My eyes burn, my limbs ache, and yet, my mind refuses to quiet itself.

I toss, I turn. The sheets, damp with sweat, tangle around my legs like vines, rooting me in place. I try to relax, surrendering to the void, but sleep teases me with false promises. The seconds stretch into minutes, then into hours. My thoughts blur, melding into strange shapes and fragments of forgotten memories. Perhaps, this time, I will finally sleep.

And then, I feel it—a tug at the edges of consciousness. The weight of the day lifts, and I begin to drift into the dark embrace of sleep.

But just as my body starts to surrender, I jolt awake. My heart races, and my skin prickles with unease. A dream, hazy and fractured, clings to the edges of my mind. Something about endless corridors, shadows whispering my name, and an overwhelming sense of dread. The memory dissolves, leaving only unease in its wake.

I blink, disoriented, trying to shake off the remnants of the dream. Had I slept at all? It felt so brief, so incomplete, as if I had merely closed my eyes for a moment before being ripped back to consciousness. The clock shows no time passed—minutes, at best. My body aches with exhaustion, yet my mind buzzes with an uncomfortable clarity.

Again, I try to sleep. My body sinks into the mattress, my breathing slows. And then it happens again. The tug at consciousness, the weightlessness of sleep pulling me under.

But no sooner do I feel the comforting warmth of slumber than I wake again. The dream returns, just as fractured, just as foreboding. This time, a darkened room, shadows shifting with intent, and a figure at the edge of my vision that vanishes before I can make sense of it. The feeling of being watched lingers.

I sit up, rubbing my face, trying to clear the fog of half-formed nightmares. The clock ticks on, indifferent to my suffering. I wonder if I have truly woken up or if I am still trapped in that endless loop, moving from dream to dream without ever truly waking.

The night wears on, and each attempt to sleep becomes a cycle of brief unconsciousness and unsettling dreams. The shadows in my room seem to lengthen, their shapes twisting into something vaguely menacing. The air grows heavy, thick with a presence I cannot name.

I try to tell myself it’s just exhaustion, that my mind is playing tricks on me, but each time I wake, the dread deepens. The dreams grow sharper, more vivid. The shadowy figure lingers longer, closer, always just out of reach. I never see its face, only the outline, but I feel its gaze, cold and deliberate.

At some point, I stop trying to sleep altogether. The fear of waking up again, trapped in that cycle of dreams, keeps me from surrendering to the pull of unconsciousness. I sit up in bed, wide-eyed, listening to the silence of the room, the ticking clock the only sound in the oppressive quiet.

But the shadows still move, slithering along the walls, creeping closer. I blink, and for a moment, I see something standing at the foot of my bed. It watches me, motionless. I try to convince myself it’s just my imagination, but the weight of its gaze feels too real, too heavy.

And then, without warning, the figure is gone. The room seems to breathe again, the shadows recede, and the weight lifts. I release a breath I didn’t know I was holding, my body trembling with exhaustion and fear.

I lie back down, desperate to escape this waking nightmare, but as I close my eyes, I feel the familiar tug of sleep. It pulls me under once again, and just as I start to surrender, I wake.

The dream returns, unchanged. The figure, the shadows, the dread. I wonder if I have ever been awake at all.
