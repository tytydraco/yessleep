 

The idea of time travel has always fascinated me.  From watching movies such as “Back to the future” to creating my own time traveling machines during math class to avoid hearing my teachers boring lectures , time travel was always on my mind.

I grew up in Vancity Canada , we were a relatively prosperous family and had a lot of time and money in our hands . My father was an engineer and an inventor but unfortunately none of his inventions ever saw the light of day and were constantly rejected by  those stupid corporate people. Despite all the backlash he gained over the years , he never seemed to give up and was always looking for new opportunities to make a name for himself and make something that would make me and my mother look up to him.

And he did …

Once he caught onto my obsession with time travel he didn’t waste any time and went straight to work . He looked through all his contacts to find someone that would be willing to help him turn his fantasy into a reality ,but everyone thought he had gone mad and many of his “friends” and “family” quickly turned their backs on him…

He was truly never the same after coming face to face with the rejection of his loved ones and people he thought were his friends , and during the 5 years it took him to make the machine , things only grew worse . It started off with him being locked in his room for long periods of time . Once he finally started to come out , he was unrecognizable…

His eyes were completely red and his hands were constantly shaking whenever he ate with us or talked to either one of us . This eventually led him to use drugs in order to calm down his anxiety . It didn’t take long until the drugs finally got to him and he started to display violent and erratic behaviors against me and my mother . The only place he seemed to find peace of mind was down there in the void along with the machine …

January 13th 2003 - “STEVE COME DOWN!!! I FINISHED IT,  I FINISHED IT !” he screamed . I’ll admit that I was pretty paranoid considering his behavior in the past but it seemed like this meant a lot to him so I went along with it and made my way down there..

I wish I hadn’t …

It was pitch black in there , I walked slowly feeling around for something to hold onto , until I finally came across a doorknob . I yanked the door open and my eyes were immediately hit by a bright red light . I could see my father standing there , leaning against his work table with a giant smile spread across his face as he contemplated his creation.  A giant metal capsule .

He felt accomplished for once in his life …

I’ll admit that during that moment his excitement got to me and I decided to leave my skepticism aside and let him enjoy his moment. My father exclaimed “ BEHOLD THE VIATOR!!!!” . He then walked up to me and handed me a pamphlet titled “***10 steps across time***” which I assumed was the owner's manual . I held it in my hand and flipped through a couple pages trying to configure all the weird symbols it displayed and by the time I looked back up I could see that the VIATOR’S door was closed shut and my dad was waving me goodbye from the other side . After a couple moments it started rattling violently and the red light started flashing quickly along with a loud siren! I tried desperately to pry the door open but just as quickly as everything started it stopped and the VIATOR was nowhere to be seen.

I wish I had stopped him when I had the chance …

I stood there for a long time until suddenly a bright light shined into the room and the Viator came into view once again . I quickly rushed towards it , opened the door but he wasn’t there anymore . I went into it but the only thing I could find was a giant black spike along with a piece of cloth  and the year he traveled to , it was the year 2028 . I slammed the door shut and in tears rushed up the stairs , my mother was in the kitchen and when I caught sight of her I explained to her everything I had just witnessed moments earlier . She seemed confused at first so I grabbed her hand and led her down into the void . Once I opened the door I could see her eyes fill up with tears as she looked into the Viators eyes and processed the reality of the situation .

She yanked me by the arm , rushed me out of the room and banned me from ever returning . I was fine with her decision through my middle and high school years but once I left home and headed towards college the curiosity regarding my fathers disappearance started to consume me. All I could think of during the past 2 years was of entering the void and coming face to face with my fears once again . This time , determined to solve this mystery once and for all.

All this brings us to today , my mother is away from home on a cruise to the Bahamas with a couple friends and she told me to watch over our dog . I already fed Max and now I’m making my way down there…

It’s either now or never , I’ll keep everyone updated.
