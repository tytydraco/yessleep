*Thanksgiving break was approaching and I decided to stay on campus alone, only I wasnt as alone as I thought.*

What I'm about to tell you may seem wild and imaginative and to some maybe unbelievable. But what I'm about to tell you it's completely true. Thinking back on it, I kind of wish it was something I imagined in my head. But it wasn't, and to this day it still sticks with me as a defining moment in my life. Along with the rest of the strange events that happened, after I first encountered The Stranger from the Car.

Fast forward 5 years from the first encounter with this stranger, this intruder who stalked me over a weekend alone while my parents were away. I was Now 20 at the time and attending college, residing in a dorm on campus. Thanksgiving was just a few days away and mostly everyone I knew including my roommate were leaving campus.

My Parents decided to take a cruise for the week of Thanksgiving, and the thought of seeing my Grandparents who I believe still despise me for the holiday sounded dreadful. So I decided I'd Stay on campus and eat thanksgiving dinner in the cafeteria. Only I expected others to stay and do the stay at least, But much to my surprise It was only Me and Our Campus Security, Officer Jenkins who would remain on campus for the week along with a few of the Kitchen staff to make a small thanksgiving meal for Anyone who Stayed behind.

Thanksgiving break began rather uneventfully. I was used to the hustle and bustle of college life, but now, with most of the students off campus and the grounds practically empty, it felt as if the world had shrunk to just me and the looming shadows stretching across the buildings. I was beginning to feel bored and lonely, and I couldn't call my parents who were in the middle of international waters at this point.

Officer Jenkins, the older security guard with a gruff exterior and an almost paternal sense of vigilance, I was the only person on campus. We'd exchanged small talk in the cafeteria as we ate our solitary Thanksgiving meal, but even his presence couldn't shake the feeling of being watched. The same feeling I'd had that weekend 5 years ago when my parents went away for my dads work trip.

It all started on the second night of break, around 12pm. I walked back towards my dorm from the library, for some reason, campus super dark as all of the security lights are timed to turn off at midnight. I had been in so late to finish my paper that now, for the first time, I realized how dark and isolated it all was. A light breeze whipped up fallen leaves, carrying with it an air crisp with oncoming winter. As I passed the parking lot near the edge of campus, I saw a car that looked like it was out of place. It was parked toward the far end, running, but with its headlights off.

At first, I didn't think much of it. There were plenty of empty cars this time of year, but it wasn't common for someone to park and leave their car running. But then, as I continued walking, something made me glance back. Just as I glanced back I noticed a figure sat in the driver's seat, just behind the wheel, motionless, as if they were waiting. My breath caught in my throat.

I began to walk more quickly, telling myself it was nothing, I was just paranoid. But as I reached the stairwell to the dorm, the feeling of eyes on me was unmistakable. I turned my head sharply, catching a glimpse of something behind me. It was the car that had been there but now without a person behind in the drivers seat. Nothing moved, there was only an empty car, yet a presence I could feel. That crawling sensation of something gave rise to the hair on the back of my neck.

I got settled into my Dorm and called the main office and got ahold of Officer Jenkins, but after he patrolled the campus he called me back to let me know much to my surprise that the car I had saw was no longer there.

By the fourth night, I'd had enough. My mind kept drifting back to that first incident with the man in the car, how his face was indistinguishable in the dark, how the impression of his gaze was always on me though I could never catch a proper glimpse of him.

I went to see Officer Jenkins, whose office was tucked behind the main office desk in the campus building, always kept in dim lighting with old coffee cups and papers strewn about. He sat behind the desk, thick glasses perched low on his nose as he flipped through a binder of incident reports.

Hey, Officer Jenkins," I started, looking around in a somewhat paranoid fashion as if someone might be listening. "There's something weird going on. I keep seeing this car parked at the same spot at night, andâ€¦ I don't know. It's been creeping me out. I know you said It was gone by the time you checked but I still have the feeling of being watched at night.

Jenkins didn't look up from his binder. "It's just you and me on campus, kid. Everyone else's gone. Could be a late night driver or someone visiting the place. There's nothing to worry about."

His words were supposed to reassure me, but they didn't. I wasn't sure if he was trying to ease my fears or just brushing it off, but I knew what I had seen.

That night, the air was heavier, more smothering. I walked in the dark back from the cafeteria to my dorm, my heart pounding with every step. When I reached the parking lot, the car was again there, waiting for me it seemed, like it had expected me. Its headlights beaming, casting eerie shadows across the empty lot.

I took a deep breath and told myself that this was it, that this was something that I had to face. This wasn't paranoia, I knew instinctively that there was something not quite right here. I drew closer to the car, my mind racing through all the options. The closer I came, the heavier my sense of foreboding felt.

Then I saw it.

The figure in the car was seated in the driver's seat, his face obscured by the darkness. It was that same feeling from before. That cold, unnerving presence.

I felt frozen, my body unable to react. It wasn't until I heard the faint sound of footsteps behind me that I snapped out of it. I whipped around, panic surging through me as I saw Officer Jenkins walking toward me, his flashlight cutting through the darkness.

"You alright, kid?" he asked, his voice calm but laced with a hint of concern.

I opened my mouth to say something but nothing came out. I was too scared to say what I had known all along. The terrifying truth, that the stranger wasn't lurking in the shadows. They were following me, watching me. And worse, they had been on campus this whole time.

Officer Jenkins stepped forward and laid the beam of his flashlight on the car. The figure was gone. The headlights were off, and the car was silent now, like it had never been there at all.

He sighed. "You've been seeing things, I think. It's just us here, and that's the way it's gonna be for the rest of the week. Now, go on and get some sleep. You're overthinking this."

But I knew, deep down, that Officer Jenkins didn't believe me. He didn't see the same things I had. The figure, the car it was all real. And the stranger wasn't gone.

I went back to my dorm that night, but I couldn't shake this feeling that someone was out there, waiting for me. With Officer Jenkins on campus, it no longer felt safe. It wasn't the isolation but the creeping feeling that somewhere in the dark corners of campus, the stranger from the car was still watching. And this time, I didn't think I'd be able to escape them.

It was the last night of Thanksgiving break, and at around 1:30am, I was awakened by the a familiar yet blood-curdling sound. Beep-beep! I had heard it before years ago, only this time it was different and more insistent, almost frantic. I sat up in bed, my heart racing. I ran to my dorm window and looked out.

There it was again, the same car parked in the parking lot, its headlights cutting through the darkness. But this time, the horn was blowing, like he was really laying on it. I felt confused and a little scared as I quickly reached for my phone and dialed the front desk to try to get Officer Jenkins on the line. But as I waited, the line was silent, dead. My pulse quickened. That couldn't be right. The phones had worked fine just hours before.

I frustratedly threw the phone down and then bolted from my room toward the main office, in hopes Jenkins could assist me. The silence of the halls seemed to elevate every step that I took as being very loud and conspicuous. As I neared the large entryway glass doors, my eyes caught something.

A figure stood in the shadowed hallway outside the dorm through the glass, his eyes fixed on mine. It was him, the man from the car. He didn't move, just stared. It was as if his presence froze time. I stepped backward, my breath catching in my throat, but he didn't stop. He slowly reached for the door handle.

The panic swelled in. I swung around and ran, my feet pounding against the cold tile floor. I couldn't think straight. My mind was racing with the thought of something terrible about to happen. As I ran down the empty Hallways I could Hear his footsteps closely behind me. I burst into my room, clicked the door shut behind me, and dropped onto the floor to try to steady my breathing.

The handle shook. My heart stopped. It was him. Rattle-Rattle. Bang-Bang! This went on for a solid 4 minutes and then silence. I held my breath and listened. Seconds passed, then minutes. The door didn't open, Was he still out there, or had he moved on? I didn't hear a sound, so I sat up and walked slowly towards the door of my dorm. I pressed my ear against the door to listen in hopes of hearing if he was still there. Thats when I heard it, the same voice that mutters Hmm as I was pressed behind that Christmas tree box in the closet all those years ago. Only this time it muttered ever so softly; I will Always find you.

Just then for a split second, my heart skipped a beat and I froze in complete fear. I fell to the floor, hands pressed behind me to keep myself up. All I could do was stare at the door, not knowing what had just happened. Minutes passed as just sat in complete silence staring at the door, when once again I was startled by a stern knock. Knock-Knock-Knock! "You okay in there kid?" Officer Jenkins shouted out.

I sat up quickly and opened my dorm door. I'd never been so happy to see Officer Jenkins before in my life, yet there I was so relieved to see him! I ran into his arms and shouted, I've never been so glad to see you! He was he here, he was trying to get in my dorm!

Much to my surprise Jenkins witnessed him running out of the hallway door and getting into his car, quickly peeling out of the parking lot in panic as he shined his flashlight in his direction. "He's gone kiddo, and the authorities are on the way" he said sternly!

The Morning slowly rolled in, and after a brief time of filing Was he indeed the same person who had broken into my house all those years ago? Why Me? Unfortunately, this would not be my last encounter with the stranger from the car...
