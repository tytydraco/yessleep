hey there r/nosleep.

im going to give some context for the story.
ever since i was 7 years old, i randomly had dreams that perfectly predicted the future down to the last detail, they're never about any important stuff, just unimportant things.

today i had a unusual dream, there was something inhuman stalking me as i went about my day, it was never like it to give me such unsettling visions off the future, which led to me waking up before the end of the dream, i realized that this was how my dream started, me waking up from a dream early then getting dressed afterwards before going to school. today was a school day so i knew it was inevitable to be fulfilled sooner or later. i wish i had skipped school.
first of all, a student jump from the roof, his skull getting fractured but without any brain damage. i know it because it already happened, making my fears worse as the next thing was rhe teacher having a heart attack during math class.

"if it happens, it's over for me" i thought, unaware of how right i would be soon as sure enough, our math teacher died from a heart attack as i felt something gazing at me from the window, befor i looked, it went away as i braced for another thing that will happen, which was one of my bullies getting thrown out of the window. my dreams usually never show me everything, leaving minor details out.
i looked around in fear but before i could react, it already happened, there he was, going through the air as something or someone threw him and he soon landed on the street, a car failed to notice him and drove over him, leading to a second death today. i hurried home the second my classes ended, not wanting to cause harm to anyone else as i saw a pair of girls that i knew spent time on their phones as they got electrocuted in the bathroom. i hoped to avoid it by being gone when it should happen, it was on the news.
"two girls electrocuted to death at school"

it has said enough that they died, no matter what, what was predicted will happen regardless, so i just sat in my room,  my phone on the news as i awaited the next one, my friend dying because of a drunk driver on his way to my home. i already knew there was no preventing his death, as confirmed by the two girls dying despite my absence unlike the dream said that i watched it happen.

if anyone has ideas what to do to stop all these predictions, please tell me because even when i write it, my dreams are coming true, leading to more deaths as i feel something staring at me, i caught a glance of it, it was a nearly invisible creature with empty spaces for eyes(you know, like when there is a object with a hole and a shadow is cast through it). it seemed to have a gri. as it left my view, making sure i saw it.

if anyone has similar things(predictions of the future) happening, please tell me if you ever prevented those prophecies, and if yes. please share your methods.
