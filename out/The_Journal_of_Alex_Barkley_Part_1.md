June 11th 2017

I am writing this because my therapist said it would help keep me grounded if I write a journal I told him I didn't want to, but he insisted and handed me this journal and asked me to write in it at least once a week over the summer. So, here I am writing in this journal in my bedroom watching a storm blowing through my town.

I guess it's alright  pretty nice to write things down and just document the summer. I should probably introduce myself then I am Alex. Well my full name is Alex Daniel Barkley but I don't really like my name very much I've been bullied for years because of it. I wouldn't change it though I'm used to the bullying so it's fine. For my family I only have my mom Gloria Barkley she isn't really reliable at all. She works at the local liquor store which dose not help with her alcoholism. She pends her time at home passed out drunk so I usually am the one doing all the house work along with my school work so I don't have time to socialize.

I don't have a father or I did when I was 4 when he was deployed and was killed in combat. That's when my mom started drinking. I think I'm going to end this entry here. This was pretty nice I might actually write in this more.

It's been a couple days since I wrote in this my mom has been keeping me busy with the house work since she has been really emotional so she has made a mess of the house so I've been cleaning after her. I don't really want to be home very much I might try exploring some of the old buildings in my town since there isn't much else to do.

I overheard about the old high school at the edge of town it is by the woods so not many people go there other than the other teens who go there to smoke, drink, and bone so I don't know if I will find any one there. I don't think people will be there after the storm since it was condemned years ago after a really bad storm and the already poor construction it was deemed not safe. There was a rumor of a man in our town would go into there and every time he came out he would have large bags full of stuff so there was rumors of a meth lab in the basement. The man disappeared a few years ago some kids at school say he was killed by the mob but I don't think they know what that means.

I'll write some more tomorrow I'll bring my journal to write down what I find in there I think it might be interesting and it'll be like I'm a scientist I think it'll be fun. See you tomorrow I guess.

11:36 am

I am on my way to the abandoned high school building I brought some stuff with me like a flashlight, my journal, a camera, a knife in case I find someone or something dangerous, and I brought an axe to see if I could get into the basement if it isn't opened. I'll write again once I get there 

12:56 pm

I'm in the building it's what you would expect pretty run down some left over school stuff it is pretty neat.

1:09 pm

I found my way to the second floor there are a lot of holes and weak spots in the floor so I won't be here for long. 

1:13 pm

I found something it looks like some kind of rune or symbol it looks like a six sided star held up with some kind of weird rope.

1:20 pm 

I'm outside the building I found the basement but let me go back to the thing I found. It was a piece of wood in the shape of a six sided star with a smiling face in the middle I checked the rope it wasn't rope. IT WASN'T ROPE IT WAS AN INTESTINE!!! SOME SICK FUCK HUNG IT UP WITH AN INTESTINE. I don't know who's it it but I booked it. I ended up tripping on my way down and fell down a short flight of stairs and found the basement door it was barricaded with some wood boards I dropped my axe down there and I can't leave it there so I'm going to check it out but, I'm scared I heard some singing or chanting I couldn't tell there was light coming from under the door. I'll go back in when I have a chance to calm down. I'll write again once I get down there.

2:49 pm

I'm in the basement I broke down the barricades the door is cracked open the chanting stopped when the door opened no one has come out but there is something in there calling my name I don't know what it is. I looked in there is one person in there and it's tied to the ground with chains. I'll try to describe it. 

It looks to be 6 feet tall even though it is hunched over and kneeling it has dark grayish green skin, it's arms are so long longer than they should they look to bee longer than it is tall right now, it's hands are so long it's finger longer with large claw like nails on the end, it looks like it has a tail it looks like a long iguana's tail, it has wing on it's back they look like mosquito wings they fluttering like it is trying to fly, its neck is long and it is looking right at me it has blood red eyes no other colors just blood red orbs it is like it is staring into my soul, it is wearing a mask it looks to be made of stone it is shaped like a six pointed star each spike of the star is a different color the mask is chained at each point with large chains to the wall behind it. 

It's speaking its voice is deep horse and gravely it's so deep that I feel my bones shake as it speaks. It is telling me to enter I'll update again when I can I'm going to do what it says I don't know why but I'm scared of what it'll do if I don't there is paper on the chains they look like talismans this is gonna be a bad decision.

3:58 am

It felt like I was only in there for 10 minutes but I was in there for 13 hours. I set it free it said it is an elder god and was trapped here it said it said it would give me it's boon if I set it free so I did god what did I do I shouldn't have done that I'm going to go home and go to bed maybe I can convince myself this is just a dream. It disappeared in a cloud of smoke. I'll write again when I get the chance. Hopefully I didn't release a demon. or something worse.
