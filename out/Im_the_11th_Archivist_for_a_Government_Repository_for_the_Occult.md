“Help Wanted: Museum archivist needed, located in the greater Coconino County, Arizona area. Relocation required, housing provided, paying well-above industry average.”  
I’d be a fool not to admit that seeing that ad, as I doom-scrolled Indeed at 3 AM, piqued my interest. My parents had always told me, and I’d ignored them, that being a history major wouldn’t pay. In my youth, years long since having left me behind, I believed that I’d make a good life for myself with my chosen degree—after all, history was, is, my passion. Though the passion hasn’t left me, I can’t in good conscience say that much money has come my way either.  
I’ve done my time over-seas digging up ancient treasures, sure, but I’ve always found myself better suited to the comforts of home than any foreign country. Call me set in my ways, and I’d more-than-likely agree with you. Archaeology sure did pay the bills, but the requirements just outweighed the benefits for me.   
Now I’ve worked, for more years than I care to admit, archiving those ancient treasures for a local museum. Not a small affair by any means, but the sheer size of the selection this out-of-the-way town had to offer always shocked me. At least, until the museum was shut down, and our artifacts redistributed, due to lack of funding.   
Our benefactor, you see, a kindly old billionaire, well, died. Having seen fit to leave the bulk of his riches to his only son, after two short years the museum was shit-outta-luck without his continued contributions. That left my sorry self, past my prime years, hunting for a job. I’d heard people tell stories about the job market, and how grueling a process it could be; I can’t say I quite believed them, until now. It’s been three long weeks of applications and fruitless interviews, and before long I’ll be run out of my own house by the bank.  
That brings me back, now, to this strange job listing. I’ve seen many similar job ads like this one, but none have been so damnably vague. It’s equal parts interesting and confusing, but the well-above industry average pay certainly sounds nice.   
For now, I’ve sent in my application. I’ll have to let you all know how it goes.  
Well, that was easier than I’d expected—suspiciously so. Not more than three hours after I’d sent in my resume, I’d received not only a response but a job offer. The contents of the email I received offer far more questions than answers, but I suppose I’d be remiss not to give this new gig a shot.   
“Greetings, Andrew. 

My name is Eliese Teritru, the caretaker of Repository λ. I’ve reviewed your application, and have found it to be perfect for our operation. Housing, as mentioned, will be provided by the company in the neighboring town of Bitter Springs, Arizona. The commute from the town to your new place of work is nearly forty-five minutes each way, and due to this inconvenience you’ll be alotted $150/per week (in addition to your base pay) for gasoline. I do hope this will assuage any concerns you may have with respect to funding. We here at Warehouse Fourteen believe that an important aspect of your work, any work done, is proper compensation.   
Should you wish to join us here in the desert of Arizona, you’ll be provided your new address and your first day of work will be seven days from today, 3/18/2024. Please arrive promptly, and do drive safe. We here at the Repository greatly look forward to working with you.  
Dr. Eliese Teritru, PhD”  
Why, of all things mentioned, would she tell me about gas? I mean, don’t get me wrong, I’ll take the gas money. Any employer offering that kind of deal, especially in this economy, must not be all that bad. I have plenty of questions, comments, and concerns, but I guess I’ll have to start working there to get a chance to ask. That’s why I’ve come here, does it sound too good to be true?  
I’ve always believed that if you think someone is playing you, they likely are. That said, it’d be foolish to give up such a solid job for these unfounded reasons. Right? I’m leaning towards taking the plunge, uncertainty be damned. Leaving will always be an option, and if this Teritru woman doesn’t live up to her promises I’ll do just that.   
Well, it’s been a week since my last entry and I’ve arrived in Bitter Springs. I can’t blame whoever came up with that fitting name, as I’ve been here three hours and I’m already feeling a good deal bitter myself.   
The accommodations, though, aren’t bad. The small house came fully furnished. I have two bedrooms, one of which is set up as a delightful little office, a spacious kitchen, and two bathrooms. The one thing I’ve noticed, though, is how strangely the locals are treating me. It’s a small town, more of a village really, and it’s clear that the locals see me as an outsider to be treated with suspicion, if not outright avoided. I hope that may change with time.  
The even stranger thing, though, was a list of rules I found sitting on the kitchen counter. Now I really feel like I’ve stepped willingly into some damned internet creepy-pasta.   
“To the new Archivist of Repository λ,  
Please obey these rules. They’ve saved my life more times than I can count.  
1)  Always wear gloves when handling artifacts—any artifact.   
2)  Don’t believe what you’re told, no matter who’s doing the telling.  
3)  Stay observant, and don’t get complicit. Many a good archivist has been lost that way.   
4)  If you think something is suspicious, trust your gut.   
5)  Never look behind you in the Warehouse, there are things watching that you don’t want to see.   
6)  Remain in the office between the hours of 2:37-3:52 AM, should you find yourself on the Repository floor during those hours. Well, I’d try to hide from him.   
7)  Let the field agents do their job, but within the Repository you’re in 	charge.   
8)  Always look a gift-horse in the mouth. 	  
Well, those rules should set you straight—at least at first. As you work longer, and become more experienced I’m sure that you’ll find more of your own. In the meantime, enjoy the new digs and safe archiving!  
\-Jarrod Jefferies, Archivist 10”  
Now in every internet story I’ve read, the protagonist has assumed that the mysterious letter of rules is a cruel prank. In all the reading I’ve done, it’s led to nothing but trouble. Now I have the same suspicion, mind you, but I don’t want to end up dead—or even worse. In that vein, I’ll plan to proceed as if these rules are legit, all the while hoping they’re bull shit. My first day of work begins tomorrow, and I’m sure that will help me determine what sort of situation I’ve gotten myself into.   
In the meantime, I’ve decided to research this Repository λ. Nothing, and I mean nothing. The sheer lack of information is reminiscent of sitting inside the event horizon of a black hole, and the only news article that pops up is from one of those conspiracy theory blogs. They claim that a pan-global organization stores occult artifacts in a series of storehouses across the world. That all seems a bit far fetched for me.   
Though the article made for a rather interesting read, I can’t say that I found it very compelling.  
My next internet search had me stalking, or at least trying to stalk, Jarrod Jefferies. That, too, was not much more than a dead-end. The man hasn’t so much as an Instagram profile, it’s a might strange if you ask me.   
I’m sure glad that I’m getting paid for this drive, because it’s really quite dull. I’ve never been one to truck it through the open desert, but that’s what I’m doing now—an occupational hazard I suppose.  
After nearly fifty minutes of dull driving, without internet data I might add, I finally arrived at what I can only assume to be Repository λ. It really is quite an imposing structure. At least five hundred feet tall two thousand across, its shining steel struts reflect the sun right into my eyes. Mine isn’t the only car, though. Four automobiles, two shining black sedans, a gray panel van, and rusting VW Bug, sit in a small parking lot nearly two hundred feet away. Maneuvering slowly over the rocky terrain, my car ambles to join them.   
As soon as I’ve parked, I look out of my driver’s side window to see three people have appeared. I don’t recall having seen them before, but I suppose stranger things have happened. Two of them wear well fitted black suits, and the woman in the middle a bright floral dress. As I step out of the car, the man on the left introduced himself first.   
As he reached his hand out for a shake, I see the gun and badge on his hip—and tense noticeably. He quickly shakes it off, and continues in his introduction.   
“It’s a pleasure to meet you, Andrew. I’m Special Agent Arbern, but you can call me Rick. I’m looking forward to working with you.”  
Special Agent? What in twelve hells is a special fucking agent doing at this warehouse in the middle of nowhere? Why is he looking forward to working with me, will we be coworkers? I’ve never thought I’d be working with any special agent. Can this be one of those ‘field agents’ that Jarrod mentioned?  
“Uhm, hi.” I began, shaking the proffered hand, “Special agent of what exactly? And, I mean no disrespect, what the hell are you doing at this museum?”  
At this, each person in front of me nearly breaks down into varying displays laughter. “Well, Andy, may I call you Andy?” Rick doesn’t stop for my answer, “The Defense Intelligence Agency signs my checks, but for right now I report to Dr. Teritru here.” He gestures at the flower clad woman at his left.   
Not missing a beat, the woman on the other side of Dr. Teritru makes her own introduction. Not nearly as friendly as her colleague, she doesn’t see fit to offer me a hand. “Hello, I’m Special Agent Eris Elycott, FBI, before you ask.”  
Seemingly a woman of few words, Agent Elycott doesn’t say much more in that moment.   
Finally, Dr. Teritru breaks the silence with an offer. “It’s very, very hot out in this desert heat. How about the three of us go inside, and get to know each other a little better?”  
Not sensing any other option, for better or for worse, I follow these three individals inside this ginormous structure they call ‘Repository λ.’  
There Repository itself, as least what of it I can see now, is a bit underwhelming if I’m to be honest. After we walked through the large metal doors, we walked for nearly twenty seconds down a narrow white hallway. Now, after climbing a four story high staircase, we’re sitting in an office of sorts. There are three desks stationed along the far wall facing drawn red curtains, and the rest of the room is rather recreational in nature. There’s a coffee machine, water-cooler, and even a higher-end looking pool table at the far end of this long rectangular room.  
One of two long sides of the rectangle, facing opposing of me and the door I’d entered through, is draped in the aforementioned red curtains. I’m not sure what they open to, but I can only assume it’s impressive given the sheer size of this building. No matter though, as I’ve been sat down, much like a misbehaving child, in a far corner. These three mysterious people sit across from me, and I read something scary in the way they talk, behave, and look at me.  
Special Agent Arbern, though I suppose I should call him Rick, is the least off-putting. That is, I’m sure, an affectation he’s practiced for years. Working in Defense Intelligence, and all, he’s likely rather adept at hiding true emotions and intentions. That doesn’t explain Agent Elycott’s outright hostility. I haven’t known this woman for more than ten minutes, and she’s already acting like I’d fed her a cat turd and forgotten the mustard.  
Dr. Teritru, and I do wonder what her doctorate is in, is the most confusing. When contrasting Rick’s friendly demeanor and Elycott’s standoffishness, it’s semi-easy to know where I stand. With this woman, though, I haven’t the slightest hint of a clue. It’s making me nervous, more so than I’d care to admit.   
I’m curious to hear what she has to say, not least of all because she’s clearly calling the shots here. Hell, she has specials agents from DIA and FBI working under her, so I can’t imagine there not to be a damned good reason.   
“When you cross your legs and rub circles into your palms with your thumbs, you project your nervousness to the entire room, you know?” Elycott’s words pull me from my thoughts, and bring my attention to my posture. She isn’t wrong, I suppose, though her cutting words only serve to increase my nervousness. It can’t be hard to pick up on my energy, but who the hell can blame me? This situation is not just weird, it’s down right fishy.  
“Well damn, Eris. Leave the guy alone, he’s only been here ten minutes. Neither of you have barely said a word to him, and you,” Rick glances meaningfully at Elycott, “have been openly hostile. He’s our coworker for Christ’s sake. Don’t be an ass.” Though I appreciate his taking up for me, the outburst doesn’t do much to bring me comfort. The last thing I need, to my way of thinking, is to drive two federal agents into a feud over my very existence.   
Addressing me now, Rick continues, “please forgive Eris. The FBI trained her as a profiler, so she can read into people’s body language. They didn’t train her not to use her knowledge to freak people the hell out.” Again, he shoots her a nasty look.  
Responding to him she says, “Well, it isn’t my fault that he looks like a three week old kitten who’s just seen his mother run over by the family Jeep.”   
Seeing fit to ignore her entirely, and make his response known by assuaging me he says. “She’s harmless, kid. It took the lady seven months of work to finally address me by my first name, she’s just a bit aggressive at first.”  
Even I can see a brutal response welling up inside Elycott, but before she can voice it Dr. Teritru breaks in. “Enough.”  
At this, both special agents are cowed. It’s impressive to see two badged and armed federal agents so throughly disarmed by a civilian academic, but I suspect that this woman has more going on than meets my eyes. “The two of you are shitting the bed with your first introduction to your new archivist.” She exchanged pointed glances with both offending parties. “Now I tolerate work-place banter, but for the love of god do choose the right time and place. You’re the some of the finest agents either of your outfits have to offer, so please use those deductive skills. Is this the right time? Is this the right place?”  
Two seconds turn into five, and five soon turn to ten. “That question wasn’t rhetorical Special Agents. Is it the right time? The right place?” Her exterior remains calm and collected, but her cold words clearly bring fear to the eyes of the agents.   
“No, Doctor.” Both agents mutter in unison. I sense that this isn’t the first time such an interaction has taken place.   
“Good, now we can get on with more pressing matters.” Turning her attention towards me, at last, her gaze softens. “Now, Mr. Reiz, what all do you know about this place. The Repository?”  
“Well,” I stammer, “I’d assumed it was some sort of museum gig, but I gather that isn’t exactly the full story? I’ve never seen federal agents working for a museum.”  
Teritru chuckled, “Well, you aren’t wrong. The government doesn’t often deputize agents to any old museum. But this, as you’ve probably gathered, isn’t any normal museum. It isn’t really a museum at all; that moniker implies visitors or exhibits, and λ has none. This place is hidden away from society, and very few, outside a select number, know of its existence.  
We don’t house ancient artifacts, mosaics, or tools. At least, not because they are ancient. This place stores objects of a more supernatural variety; Artifacts of the occult and anomalous nature. Objects that, if wielded or handled incorrectly, can do anything from make your ears ring to have you bleeding out through your eyeballs.”  
Well, bleeding out through eyeballs sounds unpleasant. I suppose that’s the reason I’d ought wear gloves? I’m not frankly inclined to believe this nonsense, but the presence of federal agents lends this charade some credibility. That red curtain, though, becomes more imposing the more this woman speaks.  
“The artifacts aren’t, by their nature, dangerous. Only when handled incorrectly, but it’s part of your job as an archivist to learn and understand the rules. Should you follow the rules, and execute the duties of your position adequately there shouldn’t be any problem for you at all. That said, if you don’t follow our rules, if you become sloppy, well, then it’ll be time for me to hire a twelfth archivist.”  
A twelfth? Does that make me\` archivist eleven? I remember, now, the way Jarrod Jefferies signed his letter:  
“-Jarrod Jefferies, Archivist 10”  
I imagine that he’d held this position before me, but it begs the question: what became of him? What may become of me, if I don’t quit this job right here and now—if they’d even let me quit. I have a sinking feeling that, now that I know the secret of this place, I won’t be allowed to leave so easily. It isn’t shocking that I’m making so damned much money, it’s hazard pay.   
“Well, Special Agents,” Teritru began again, “do you think it’s time to show Archivist 11 the warehouse?”  
Though they remain silent, the doctor doesn’t seem to worried about their lack of response. Standing up from the chair and walking towards the far wall, she pulls a chain and the curtain draws back. What’s revealed behind the curtain? The largest warehouse I’ve ever seen, likely the largest to have ever existed.   
It’s been three weeks since my last post, and things have become harrier. I’ve been on the floor now for two and a half weeks. This place is more confusing and terrifying that I could’ve imagined. Each artifact is arranged by their innate properties, and while some are nearly harmless others can easily kill me at any moment.   
What make’s it easier, though, are the notes left in front of each artifact detailing proper handling. I’m sure each of these lessons were hard fought from previous archivists, and cost some their lives. Not wanting to end up like those sorry bastards, I’ll take all of the help I can get. On my twentieth day, I believe it was my twentieth, I found myself with use for Jarrod’s rules for the first time.   
When I’d began my official training, the caretaker had given me a list of official rules and had me commit them to memory. Knowing well the written rules of this place, I’d done fine so far. By my estimation, the advice I’d been given by my predecessor is knowledge that only another archivist would think to give. Now I don’t rightly know what most of it means, but I’m glad I remembered rule #5.   
I can’t remember what time it was, but it was certainly past dark. I was the only one in the Repository, as everyone else had returned to their houses in Bitter Springs. I was walking down one of many long halls, probably nearly 3/4 of a mile from the main office, when I heard a strange shuffling behind me. Glancing quickly down at my watch, I was relived to see that the time was only midnight.  
I didn’t know who came out between two and three, but I can’t say I want to meet him any time soon. That leaves the question, though, what was behind me? My pace quickened as did my beating heart, but the shuffling only grew closer behind me. Looking left and right, I knew that the artifacts near me were benign and nearly harmless.   
I then broke into a light jog, which I’d soon learn was a mistake. The shuffling kept good time with me, but now a ragged panting was audible as well. A chill ran down my spine, a cold wash of terrorizing dread like I’ve never felt before. The hairs on my neck, arms, and back stood and I’m certain my pebbly skin could’ve been used as a washboard.   
As I geared up to look behind me, and put this situation to bed once and for all, something stopped me. The echoing words of that hand written note from nearly three weeks ago,  
“5)  Never look behind you in the Warehouse, there are things watching that you don’t want to see.”  
I took the suggestion to heart, and decided to make haste back to the office, and to my new home, without any more trouble. Figuring if there was any real danger, it would’ve been mentioned in the official guidebook, I decided to ignore the creep trailing me in this strange place.  
I’ve been here three weeks, so who am I to judge a creature who’s surely been here far longer than I?  
This little game of cat and mouse continued for almost six minutes until I’d reached the edge of the staircase that would lead me to the office. I only wish I’d remembered a key design point of the staircase, the blind-spot mirror.  
Now if anybody reading has worked in a restaurant, you surely know the mirror I’m speaking of. It’s placed well above eye-level, and is positioned to give you a solid view of whats both behind you and around a corner.   
Rule #5. I shouldn’t have looked into that damned mirror.  
What lurked behind me, now not more than five feet away, was one of the most perverted creatures I’ve seen in my life. The thing must have been nearing on seven feet tall, but couldn’t weigh more than one-hundred and twenty pounds. It’s tall lanky form was outlined by sickly green skin, but it’s face. My god, it’s face. The eyes were larger than any humanoid’s eyes have a right to be, and they were a deep jaundiced yellow. Sitting in the center of these yellow eyes were two back pupils in each eye, adding to four total.   
Its mouth, too, was drawn back in a broad grin that exposed far to many teeth. If I weren’t seeing it in real time, I’d think the damned thing was AI generated. When its eyes made contact with mine, that smile grew wider than I’d imagined possible, and it let out a petrifying squeak of joy.   
Scrambling up the stairs, leaving my rucksack behind and a trail of tears behind me, I left that creepy being tapping a joyous rhythm with it’s feet on the cool cement floor.  
I’m done with this place, and with these people. I don’t want to find out about the rest of these rules, and I don’t want their money. It isn’t worth it, and after last night I’m nearly ready to pack my bags and leave. Though I feel I owe Dr. Teritru the respect of telling her face to face about my plans, I’m hesitant to verbalize them. I’ve put myself into this position, so now it’s time to put my money where my mouth is and get the hell out.   
I’m sitting in the same chair where I was first told about this place, and it’s oddities. Now it’s only me and Teritru, but somehow she’s even more imposing without two federal agents flanking her. Our conversation lasts for nearly thirty minutes, and I’m heartened by her sympathy and the fact that I’ll surely be rid of this place soon.   
That is, until she places a hand gently on my knee and, wearing a rueful expression, tells me a hard truth. “My dear, I’m very sorry to tell you this. Especially so after the experience you had last night, but I’m afraid that you can’t leave. Now that you’ve learned the secrets of the Repository, you’ve become a part of the fabric of the entity itself. You’ve been chosen, and the building won’t let you leave. I know very well, because I’m stuck here too.”
