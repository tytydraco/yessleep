I need to document what's happening here because something is very wrong with this competition.

Let me back up.

Three days ago, I saw the flyer stapled to a telephone pole downtown. Gold lettering on black card stock, expensive-looking: "THE GRAND ENDURANCE DANCE MARATHON - $100,000 PRIZE - ALL SKILL LEVELS WELCOME." There was an address for registration and a date. That was it. No fine print, no company name, nothing.

I know what you're thinking. Red flags everywhere, right? But you don't understand my situation. My mother is in hospice. The bills are crushing me. I work two jobs and it's not enough, it's never enough, and I'm watching her die in a facility that smells like industrial cleaner and resignation. The animals I keep three chickens, nothing fancy they're all I have that's mine. Everything else is debt and obligation and the endless grind of trying to matter in a world designed to erase people like me.

So yeah, I took the flyer.

The registration was in an old community center on the east side, the kind of neighborhood where broken streetlights stay broken and nobody makes eye contact. Inside, a woman with a tablet checked my ID, had me sign a waiver I barely skimmed, and told me to show up Friday at 8 PM. She had this professional smile that didn't reach her eyes, the kind you see on people who've had extensive customer service training.

"How many people are competing?" I asked.

"However many show up," she said, still smiling.

I should have walked away then.





The venue is called the Starlight Ballroom, though the sign outside is so faded you can barely read it. It's one of those art deco relics from the 1930s, all tarnished gilt and moth-eaten velvet. The main floor is massive, probably could hold three hundred people back in its heyday. Now it holds forty-two dancers and maybe a dozen spectators scattered in the balcony seats like vultures waiting for carrion.

When I walked in Friday night, I sized up the competition immediately. That's what you do when you're serious about winning. Most of them looked exactly like I expected: desperate. There was a woman in her fifties wearing medical scrubs under her jacket came straight from a shift. A couple of college-age kids who had that malnourished, student-loan look. A guy with tattooed arms who kept cracking his knuckles. A thin woman with a baby carrier strapped to her chest, empty, thank god. She kept touching it like a talisman.

None of them had what I have. That drive. That absolute certainty that I deserve this more than they do.

The four organizers, all wearing identical black polo shirts with "STAFF" embroidered in gold explained the rules. Simple enough: keep moving, keep dancing. Ten-minute breaks every six hours. If you stop moving for more than thirty seconds outside of breaks, you're disqualified. Last person dancing wins the hundred thousand dollars.

"What about sleep?" someone asked.

"Sleep on your own time," said the head organizer, a tall man with silver hair and that same professional smile. "We'll dim the lights during designated rest periods, but you must keep moving."

"What if we need medical attention?"

"We have an EMT on staff. If you require treatment, you'll be escorted to the medical area. Depending on the severity, you may be allowed to return or you may be disqualified. Our medical professional has full discretion."

The music started at exactly 8:00 PM. Big band stuff, upbeat and tinny through the old sound system. We began to dance.





The first six hours were almost easy. I've always been good at pushing through discomfort, years of working double shifts will do that. I kept my distance from the other dancers, found my rhythm, and watched.

The college kids were already flagging by hour three. They had that soft look of people who've never really suffered. The tattooed guy was better, he had a methodical way of moving, like he was pacing himself for a marathon. The woman with the empty baby carrier was crying silently while she swayed, tears just streaming down her face. Nobody acknowledged it.

Around hour four, I noticed the man on roller skates.

He wasn't competing, he was staff, I think. He wore all black and glided around the perimeter of the dance floor, watching us. Not like the other staff members, who occasionally checked clipboards or talked into radios. This one just watched. His skates made no sound on the wooden floor.

During the first break, most people collapsed immediately. I stayed on my feet, drinking water, eating the protein bar I'd brought. Keep the muscles warm. Don't sit if you can help it.

A woman approached me, mid-thirties, dark circles under her eyes. "Hey, I'm Sandra. This is crazy, right?"

I took another drink of water. "It's a competition."

"Yeah, but... I mean, we should stick together. Look out for each other." She smiled, hopeful and pathetic.

"That's not how you win," I said.

Her smile died. She walked away.

Good. I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to win.





The second shift started at 2:10 AM. They'd dimmed the lights like they promised, but the music kept playing. Slower now, jazz instead of big band. Some people were trying to sleep-dance, that zombie shuffle where you're barely conscious. I've done enough night shifts to know how to fight through exhaustion. Mind over matter. Always.

That's when the rules changed.

Around 4:30 AM, the silver-haired organizer's voice came over the PA system: "Attention dancers. We are implementing a new parameter. Effective immediately, all dancers must maintain physical contact with at least one other dancer. You have sixty seconds to establish contact. Failure to comply will result in disqualification."

The dance floor erupted in confusion. People scrambling toward each other, grabbing hands, linking arms. I watched the chaos with disgust. Sheep. They were all just sheep, ready to panic at the slightest—

"Excuse me, partner?"

I turned. It was the tattooed guy, hand extended. Up close, I could see the ink was mostly text; names, maybe, or quotes. His palm was calloused, nails dirty.

"Thirty seconds," the PA announced.

I grabbed his hand. His grip was firm but not aggressive. We started moving together, an awkward two-step.

"I'm Marcus," he said.

I didn't respond. Didn't give him my name. Why would I? In a few hours, when they dropped this stupid rule, I'd ditch him and go back to dancing alone.

"Twenty seconds."

Across the floor, I saw Sandra frantically reaching for the older woman in scrubs. They linked hands just as a buzzer sounded.

"Time," said the PA.

For a moment, nothing happened. Then I heard a woman scream.

One of the college kids. A girl with a blonde ponytail was standing alone near the edge of the floor, turning in circles. "Please," she said. "Please, I tried, I couldn't find anyone—"

The man on roller skates glided toward her.

He moved fast, faster than should have been possible on skates. One moment he was at the far end of the ballroom, the next he was in front of her. The music was loud but I still heard the crack, sharp, wrong, like a branch snapping. The girl crumpled.

The roller skate man bent down, grabbed her under the arms, and dragged her off the dance floor. Her head lolled. Her legs made wet scraping sounds on the wood.

No one stopped dancing.

No one even slowed down.

"Jesus Christ," Marcus whispered. His hand tightened on mine.

"She's probably just unconscious," I said, but my voice sounded thin even to me. "Medical emergency. They said they had an EMT."

"That was her neck," Marcus said. "That sound was her fucking neck."

The music shifted, something upbeat now, almost cheerful. The silver-haired organizer's voice returned: "Excellent work, dancers. The partnership rule remains in effect. Continue."

I looked around the ballroom. The other staff members were still at their positions. One by the door, one by the water station, one at a folding table with a laptop. They hadn't reacted at all. The spectators in the balcony hadn't moved.

The roller skate man was gone. So was the girl.

"We need to leave," Sandra called out, still partnered with the scrubs woman. "This is insane. We need to leave right now."

She started pulling toward the exit. The scrubs woman resisted, trying to keep dancing in place, but Sandra was determined. They made it three steps before the roller skate man appeared in front of them.

I didn't see where he came from. He was just suddenly there, blocking their path.

"The exit is closed until the next scheduled break," he said. His voice was surprisingly soft, almost gentle. "Please return to dancing."

"Fuck you," Sandra said. She tried to push past him.

Another crack. Sharper this time.

Sandra's arm bent backward at the elbow, completely backward, bone puncturing through her skin. She opened her mouth to scream but the roller skate man caught her throat with his other hand. He squeezed. The scream died to a wet gurgle.

The scrubs woman was still holding Sandra's good hand. She stood there frozen, watching Sandra's face turn purple, and I realized with cold clarity that if she let go, if she broke the partnership, he'd be disqualified too.

Marcus pulled me backward, away from the scene. We kept dancing, a clumsy waltz that put distance between us and the roller skate man. My heart hammered against my ribs. My feet moved automatically.

Sandra went limp. The roller skate man released her throat and she collapsed, pulling the scrubs woman down with her. The woman was screaming now, trying to separate herself from Sandra's body, but their hands were still connected, Sandra's dead hand locked in a death grip around the other woman's fingers.

The roller skate man grabbed them both and dragged them toward the side door. The scrubs woman fought, kicking, still screaming. The door opened. I caught a glimpse of darkness beyond, and a smell that made my stomach turn. 

The door closed.

The music continued.

"Partnership dancing will remain in effect for the next six hours," the PA announced. "Your next break will be at 8:15 AM. Continue to demonstrate excellent form, dancers."

I looked at Marcus. His face was gray, sheened with sweat.

"We have to keep moving," I said. My voice was steady. Distant. Like it belonged to someone else.

"They killed her," Marcus said. "They fucking killed her and we're just—we're just—"

"We're surviving," I said. "That's what we're doing. We're surviving."

Around us, the remaining dancers kept dancing. The woman with the empty baby carrier was sobbing again, partnered with a teenage boy who looked like he might vomit. The older man near the back had pissed himself but kept shuffling his feet. The music played on.

I counted. Thirty-eight dancers left. Thirty-eight people who had shown up Friday night looking for a miracle. Now two were gone and the rest of us were trapped in this beautiful rotting ballroom with its gilt and velvet and the man on roller skates who moved like smoke, who appeared and disappeared, who broke necks and dragged bodies into darkness.

The next break wasn't for three more hours.

My feet already hurt. A blister was forming on my left heel. Marcus's palm was slick with sweat against mine.

In the balcony, the spectators watched. Some of them were taking notes.
