Recently, I moved to lovely Brookertown, New Hampshire. It's about an hour from everywhere. As I followed the U-Hauls to my new liar, I noticed how desolate and alone the highway felt. Was I even on the highway anymore? I had not seen a car besides the truck in at least 20 minutes. 

I was zipping by giant foliage, trees as green as the Jolly green's pecker. Occasionally there would be a dirt road or a rundown driveway sprinkled into it, but mostly I was surrounded by a massive Forrest. 

If I don't sound thrilled about this move, its because I'm not. My brother recently passed away, and I was now the only one able to take care of our ailing grandfather. Grand pappy had lived in Concord all his life, up till his eyesight started to fail. We decided to relocate him a nursing home before he accidentally ran a kid over. He flat out refused, and somehow managed to relocate himself to this middle of nowhere hillbilly town. My brother lived an hour away at the time and decided to move in with the old fart, keep an eye on him.

  
This was five years ago. I had not heard from him since. We were never really that close so its no real surprise, but when I finally got word of him, and that he was dead? I admit my heart sank. So many things I should have said, but didn't. I was also surprised to learn my now 92 year old grandfather was alive and kicking. He had requested that after the funeral, I come down and spend some "quality time" with him. I knew what this really entailed, I had read my brother's will after all.  

So I quit my job, and moved to fantastic Brookertown. God what an awful name. 

Eventually, I limped into sight of my grandfather's cabin. It looked like something out of R.L.Stine. It was at least three stories, a chipped red paint stained the exterior of the house. The front porch was rotten, barely held up by three, count em, three cinder block support beams. There was even an old fashioned weather vain on top of the roof. The perfect little lighting rod in the shape of a rooster. 

  
I was in awestruck at the state of this firetrap. My brother lived HERE for five years? Jackie was always the sort of man to live well above his means, and he settled for this crap-shack? Pappy Roberts must have brainwashed him, that must be it, I thought to myself. I Parked just behind the U-hauls, and exited my car wad of 20s in my hand. The moving guys had already begun to move boxes out and into the house. I could hear yelling with a suspicious Southern drawl coming from in the house. The voice was threatening to blast the intruders with his bazooka.

  
At the time, my grandfather's impossibly Cajun accent was the strangest thing about him. I had know idea why he put it on, he had lived in the north all his life. We were Italian for gods sake. In any case the movers were ignoring the incredulous bastard. Probably dealt with things like that all the time. I saw the driver smoking a cig up near the truck and rushed over to shake his hands and "thank him" and his guys. He took the money and, with a little smirk in his eyes, said;

"You're grand-pappy don't really have a bazooka do he?" He said in a mock accent more fake than my grandfather's. 

"Not since the FDA raided the place." I remarked. This got a laugh out of the guy as the whistled to his men to run on out of there. They had really worked fast. As the dust cleared as they sped away from this condemned miss, I hear the *tap-tap-tap* of My grandfather's cane on the porch. I turned around and saw him. 

As a kid, I always thought pappy was 15 feet tall, and had a beard black as coal and smelled like one to. Because the man in front of me now completely assassinated my childhood idol. He was hunched over, barely supporting himself on his cane. His beard was patchy, unkempt. His hair snow white and his head covered in liver spots. He wore the same eyeglasses he had when he was a kid, those dorky looking turtle glasses. He was probably blind as three bats, yet I could feel his cataract blues boring into my soul. 

  
"Boy, I know I told ya to call before coming up here. I'm an old man, those men breaking in here like that, I could have keeled over I could have." Pappy Roberts roared at me. I sighed internally, and walked up the dirt path to the house to greet him. I couldn't help but noticed how decayed and full of crabgrass the front yard was. 

  
"I did call Pappy, You said you didn't care and you would probably be dead by the time I got here." I eyed him up and down. "Did you die pappy?"

I immediately regretted that snark as I felt the lighting fast *WHAP* of Pappy's cane against my shin. Ahhhh how I had missed that. 

"Now don't you be getting smart with me boy. You get smart with me again you can sleep out here with the Winndys." He remarked, turning his back to me and hobbling back inside. I noted that he was wearing lumberjack overalls and the classic red and black pattern shirt to go with it. I followed him inside and expected to see the place a hoarders wet dream. Imagine, to my genuine shock, that the place looked pristine. The floor was a beautiful hardwood, gleaming in the morning light. There was a 80, I shit you not EIGHTY inch plasma tv in the living room playing football on surround sound speakers. From the front door I could see the dinning room, It looked like Martha Stewart's garden of Eden. The Kitchen, oh Madonne the kitchen was heavenly. He actually had cured meat hanging from the rafters, and a beautiful oven that could fit an elephant inside. 

  
Pappy noticed my slack jawed expression and smiled, in spite of himself. 

  
"You really expect ya old pappy to live like a crazed coon out here, Tyler? I have 18 different streaming services boy." Pappy beamed proudly.

  
"Why not just get cable at that point, Pappy?" I asked genuinely. He scoffed at that, and waved his cane in the air. Ahh Pappy's cane. It was a three and a half foot long oak beauty. The handle was made of pure silver, carved into the shape of a snarling wolf pappy had killed when he was a burly young man. Or so he claimed anyway. I remember when we were kids, when he'd come visit us for Christmas. He'd gather us up around the fire and tell stories. The kind you don't usually tell to eight year old kids. He'd weave tales of hairy beasts and horned creatures wailing in the woods. He would always warn us to stay away from the woods at night, ". . .Or the Winndys would claim our voice." 

  
He would always go on about "The Winndys." Tall, elk like creatures that walked like a man yet hungered like a lion. Scared the bejeezus outta me when I was young, now I knew of course that Pappy liked to have his fun with us. I'd probably scare my grand kids like that as well, be a hoot. But I digress. 

That first night with Pappy was uneventful, save the com planing that I had overcooked dinner. My room, it turned out, was at least twice the size of my studio apartment and had a router right on the nightstand. It also had a king sized memory foam mattress. I slept like a  baby that night. Or I did, anyway, until I realized that my brother had slept in this same room for five years. Suddenly I felt ill. I sat up in bed and started to gaze out the window. Pappy's backyard was massive, enough room for a small kickball stadium. There was a clear divide between the yard and the woods, the trees just barely encroaching on the neatly cut grass. (Why my grandfather tended the backyard so dearly and not the front, is beyond me.) 



I began to stare into the trees, those lumbering husks of wood, hoping to fall asleep once more. I tried to listen to the sounds of crickets and late night cicadas, until I realized there was none. That struck me as odd, and then I realized there were zero sounds around. No birds, no wind, not even a passing car in the distance. The woods were like an audio dead zone. Shivering a little at the thought, I turned over in my bed and forced myself asleep. Like I said, first night was uneventful. . .

  
Next morning I drove an hour and half to find the nearest grocery store, and stacked up on about 300 pounds of food. I'm talking fruit, dried fruit, canned beans, the good sliced cheese, and some good powdered peanut butter. Pappy was less enthused by my dining choices. 

  
"What is this trash you fill ya body with boy, you should be out hunting. A real man kills his dinner, and hunts his desert." He said with a crooked grin. I ignored his oddly perverse comment at the end there and kept stacking the cabinets with the food I had bought. 

  
"Old guy like you pap, still going hunting." I said absentmindedly. "Let me cook you some good dinner tonight, I got the good peppers, the good steak." I waved it in his face like he was a bratty child. 

"Course I go hunting, once a week. Your brother Jackie went with me." Pappy beamed. There was a glint in his eye, dare I say pride. 

  
"Pfft, MY brother went hunting with ya? Pappy he was a stock broker. Before he became warden up here anyway. . ." I mumbled that last part under my breath. 

  
"It took some time, I'll admit it. But boy, your brother was one of the best hunters I had ever seen. His passing hurt. Hurt me in a way I hadn't been since ya mutha." There was a sadness now, and I could sympathize. To be 92 years old, and outlive your daughter by 30 years has to sting you. 

  
"Been a long time since mom Pappy. You didn't come around much after." I said, facing him now. I leaned against the pristine marble counter for support. I expected him to avert his eyes in shame, but the old bastard stood his ground. 

  
"It was that damn husband of hers, he was always no good, thought he knew better. Forbid me from seeing y'all." He explained adamantly. My scowl still remained, but I had to grant him that Dad did hate Pappy's guts. While it wouldn't have surprised me if dad really had tried to stop him from seeing us, I couldn't comprehend the grandfather I remember standing back and taking it. 

  
"Well, past is past Pappy. Now what do ya want for dinner." 



Dinner was quiet that night, Pappy didn't even complain about the burnt stake. (First time actually cooking it.) Then we sat in front of the TV and watched *Monster Quest.* I went up around 10pm, Pappy was still sitting there, almost like he was lost in a deep trance. I collapsed onto my bed, exhausted. I drifted off almost immediately, and I wish to god I had stayed asleep. 

  
I smelled it before I heard it. It was a rancid smell, like ancient sulfur mixed with decayed flesh. It was wafting in the air from my open window. I sprung up like a leaf and looked around. It was pitch black in my room, only a faint light from the moon outside. But that smell, god it stung my eyes, felt like I was cutting up a sentient onion. I rubbed them awake and stumbled outta bed. When I got up I heard it then.

  
"Ty-ler." A voice out from the darkness croaked. "Ty-ler." I Perked up immediately. It. . .it couldn't be right?

  
"Jackie?" I whispered back. My heart clenched up in dreaded excitement. I Rushed downstairs half naked, and sprinted to the backdoor. The door was a sliding glass, motion lights turning on from the outside as I approached. The Light was dim, I could just barely see the yard. Giant shadows danced in the darkness, and it took me a second to realize I was staring at the damn trees again. After a moment of looking at the dead silence, I thought I had simply imagined Jackie's voice. 

"Ty-ler. Come out and C-Me bro-ther." It was Jackie's voice again, from the Forrest. It was almost a gurgle, like he was choking out the words but it was him damn it. I reached for the sliding door but heisted. 

*I saw him. I saw him in the casket, his face all. . .*

  
"Tyler. He-lp Me. Help Me Ty-Ler." The voice groaned from the treeline again. I snapped back into insanity and tore the door open. I was about to run across the yard when I felt a warm but stern hand on my shoulder. It broke me out of my stupor and I saw Pappy standing there. A somber yet angry look on his face. I was about to ask him if he had heard Jackie in the Forrest, but he pointed a bony finger to his lips, shushing me. Then he pointed to the trees. 

It took me a moment, for my eyes to adjust. Or maybe I just didn't want to believe what I was seeing. At first all I saw were those giant oaks. Then I looked between them. It must have stood at nine feet tall, at least. It was lean and slender, emitting a godawful stench. I could barely make out its head, god help me its head was the shape of a deer, but larger, almost skull-like. It had massive antlers protruding out of its head. I could hear something else then, a warbling sound of some kind. Like a deer, but corrupted, mixed with some kind of reptile. It must have seen me looking at it, and when it discovered I would venture no further, it let out a horrific shriek. Like nails scraping the inside of a car muffler. 

  
And just as soon as I had seen it, it crept back into its woods. More sounds followed it, I could make out three or four distinct sounds like the creature I had seen. I just stood there, it was all I could do not to collapse out of sheer fear. I turned to Pappy, who simply nodded, like he had been expecting them.

I stuttered to find the right words to ask him what had just happened, and that old bastard, all he did was smile a toothless grin and say;

  
"Winndys, boy. There be Winndys in these woods."
