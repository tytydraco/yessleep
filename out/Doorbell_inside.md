January 2021, after the retail holiday had ended, it was time for a well-earned vacation. When looking at rentals on Airbnb, I was searching for two things: WiFi and a hot tub in the mountains. I found a lovely one-bedroom, one-bathroom rental off the highway in Idaho Springs.

The travel time was four hours, and we arrived very early for check-in. We were so early that we got to meet the owner and her tiny dog. My guest reviews on the app show that I’m very communicative, and although I have a knack for unexpected delays, this trip was the sole exception.

She was preparing the house for our visit and formally showed us the space. She also provided a home-printed binder booklet of travel/house details and another guestbook for visitors to sign.

She left promptly at our actual check-in time, and the place was ours. It was HOT TUB IN THE SNOW TIME.

The rental had everything you could possibly need to cook. Many appliances were largely unused due to their incredibly specific functions, but they were a nice addition, especially since many rentals skip on cutlery and basic kitchenware.

The cabin itself was very beautiful. All wood, though I can't speak to the type—just very real and strong authentic carpentry. The roof was especially sloped, making the space seem triangular from the outside. A sunroom separates the entrance from the outside, creating an enclosed porch with sliding doors on the left and right walls. There was only one other entrance, which we never used, as it was on the far left side of the house, behind the kitchen, where the path was hidden beneath snow.

Nearest the exit is a locked door, which could lead to a basement or a water heater—we never found out. The adjacent door leads to a classically tiled bathroom with a clawfoot tub. A huge mirror sits on a slant against the wall of the master bedroom, opposite the door and parallel to a small elevated window. The internet has taught me to always look behind mirrors and inspect other objects for small filming equipment, but there were none. The remaining open space is designated for the living, dining, and kitchen areas.

We had intended on staying for two nights. That’s all we could afford to take off work with a retail salary. The hot tub was a blessing, and the cabin was near a small town with flea markets and other adventures to explore. However, we never went into the town.

There is a certain irony to a cliché coming true. Of course, the most chilling events didn't unfold at 1 or 2:30, but at 3:05 a.m. It wasn’t a bump or a bear or anything that could make sense—it was a doorbell that sang. Not a simple "ding-dong" that could be slept through, but the entire Westminster chime. I had to Google the song because I never knew the name, only humming it out loud during explanations. It's 15 seconds long, completely unmistakable, and there wasn't a single grandfather clock to blame it on. Ten seconds in, I'm waking up my date to ensure this isn't some exclusive hallucination.

I flood the cabin with lights while they get up and look out of every window and peephole from the inside. No rustling, no figure or animal to be seen, no tracks in the snow. All the doors are already locked, and with no other explanation, it must have been a fluke of some kind.

If it had only been once, maybe it would have been. But at 3:45, an encore of Westminster chimes played.

After some well-deserved rest following two doorbell performances, it was time for a thorough investigation of the premises.

The unused exit door does have a doorbell, but no chime can be heard when pressed. This is the only doorbell on the outside. Inside the sunroom is the only other doorbell, and not only does it start the chime we’ve heard before, but it also has to be pushed in no less than two inches to ring at all.

I was scared after the first and final chime and figured the host might offer a solution—blah blah wiring or something similar. They offered to turn off the doorbell. That’s when my date finally expressed their fears.

“If they turn it off and it happens again, we will have been the idiots that end up in a movie.”

Their fear only made me spiral, but not enough to prevent me from getting one more jump in the hot tub. The host refunded us for the second night since we were checking out early. Not wanting to be alone but not wanting to take a dip, my date waited by the tub while my iPad was in the cabin filming for any activity. The footage is long, and the results didn’t catch anything that I could scrub for.

Did we leave too early? The cabin and the host were both entirely welcoming but the
 bell was enough of a warning to pack up. I have pictures with time stamps of the second bell ring and might even still have the hour of nothing footage but my ipad isn’t working right now.
