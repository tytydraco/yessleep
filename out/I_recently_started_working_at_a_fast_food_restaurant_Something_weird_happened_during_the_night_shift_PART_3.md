By the time I got back to Happy Burger, Pitty was mopping up the grimy floor.

"What happened?" he asked, his mop dripping dirty water.

"Rick happened. He fucking followed me and wouldn't let me go talk to Jorge. Said I was stalking his ex-employee."

It took Pitty a while to process that sentence.

"Hold on... *what?!"*

"Yeah."

"But how did you he know you were–"

"I don't know."

"And why would he care if–"

"I don't know!"

None of it made any fucking sense. But I knew one thing. "He's involved. And he doesn't want me to talk to Jorge."

"Shit. So what are you gonna do?"

I took a deep breath.

*"I'm gonna fucking do it anyway."*

\*\*\*

The next morning, Pitty agreed to meet me at my apartment. I told him we'd ride to Jorge's place together and that I'd even loop the long way around town to make sure Rick wasn't following again.

Then, as an extra safety precaution, I had us park three blocks away and wear sunglasses and baseball hats as we walked over to the building.

"I feel like an FBI agent," Pitty grinned. "You ever see that one movie where Keanu Reeves is an FBI agent? And then he's all like: I AM AN FBI AGENT, DUDE! Shit. I forget the title. You know what I'm talking about, right?"

I had *no* idea what he was talking about. I just shrugged and chuckled. It's funny, that's when I realized I was really growing to like Pitty. He provided some much needed lightness to those dark times.

It still makes me physically ill to think about what eventually happened to him.

\*\*\*

Jorge's apartment was up on the fourth floor. I tried not to breathe in too deeply as we walked down the hallway and across the yellow, stained carpet that smelled like piss.

Once we stood at apartment number 409, Pitty gestured to me. "Go ahead, bro. This is all you."

I knocked loudly, three times. We waited and waited, then I knocked again.

There was still no answer.

"Call him," I suggested.

Pitty took out his phone, dialed, then simply shook his head. "Phone's off. Just like before."

*Shit*, I thought to myself. Pitty turned to walk back down the hall, but I didn't budge.

"Let's go," he said. "He's not here." I looked around to make sure no one was watching. Then, I pulled out the paperclip from my pocket that I'd stuffed in there to use just in case of situations like this.

"Keep an eye out for a sec," I told Pitty as I started to pick the lock.

"Dude!" Pitty hissed. "What the fuck!"

"Quiet," I whispered. "It'll only take me two seconds..."

Thankfully, the knob was cheap and easy to pick. Finally, the door *clicked* open. Pitty stared at me, jaw dropped, impressed.

"Come on," I said, leading the way inside.

\*\*\*

"Where'd you learn how to do that?" asked Pitty as we both stepped into Jorge's shitty apartment.

"My kid brother used to lock himself in his room a lot and refuse to come out. I'd have to pick the lock on the door almost every day."

"Damn. Why'd he do that?"

"I dunno," I responded. "Guess he liked the feeling of safety."

Safety. Right. What I would give for that these days. 

Anyway, the inside of Jorge's place was a total mess. There were food wrappers everywhere, trash overflowing from the cans, as well as Happy Burger bags *all* over the floor.

But the dude I needed to talk to was nowhere to be found.

"Well, at least he's not dead," mumbled Pitty.

"How do you know?"

"Because we'd smell his body, right?"

"Unless someone *took* the body," I noted.

We both shared a terrified look for a moment. That's around the time I took another step and tripped over something. At first, I thought it was more garbage, but when I looked down, I clocked something black and hard.

*It was a VHS tape.*

I picked it up and looked at the label. Jorge (or *someone*) had scribbled HAPPY BURGER '96 AD on it.

"Check it out," I said, showing Pitty the tape.

"We... should leave that here," he said, shaking his head.

I hadn't come *that* far just to ditch our first and only clue. 

"Pitty. You've really gotta stop being such a pussy."

\*\*\*

Back at my place, we popped in the tape. If you're wondering why I had a VCR, it's because I like watching old movies on VHS. It's a superior medium, sue me.

The static consumed my TV and Pitty already looked like he was going to shit himself. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't creeped out, too.

*Why did Jorge have this recorded - and how did it connect to everything going on?*

The first thing we heard was jangly music, upbeat and fun stuff over total blackness, before Happy finally appeared on screen. Talk about a jump scare...

"Heya, kids!" he said into the camera with way too much energy. "Are you ready to get *HAPPY?"*

Happy gave a great big WAVE at the camera before the commercial cut to him inside the restaurant, surrounded by tiny children begging for burgers.

"We want Happy Burgers!" they all shrieked. "Now! Now! Now!"

"Yeah? Then how's about *this?!"* Happy snapped his fingers and via movie magic, all of the kids were now holding big, juicy burgers. They proceeded to take huge bites, like they hadn't eaten in years.

It was... disturbing, to say the least.

"This is so fucking weird," said Pitty. "I don't understand why he has this."

"Just keep watching," I said. Little did I know things were about to get even *more* confusing.

"Oh golly! We forgot to invite all my *friends!*" Happy screamed on screen.

Suddenly, we were introduced to even *more* mascots. The worst part? They were even weirder and more creepy than that fucking clown.

"Well looky there! It's Burger Bob!" yelled Happy as his first "friend" stumbled on screen. He was a grown man wearing a burger costume. But the burger did *not* look appetizing. It made me wanna throw up, to tell you the truth. 

The rubbery bun was a gross, discolored yellow, and the "sauce" that dripped down from his "patty" was a dirt brown and looked like, well... I'd rather not say.

"It's me, Burger Bob!" said the talking sandwich. "But we can't forget about the others! Kids, meet Scowler and the Tree Taker!"

The kid actors all watched intently as two more mascots appeared inside the restaurant. My eyes first fluttered towards the Tree Taker, probably because he was so tall, but also *so* fucking weird.

His outfit consisted of a plastic tree trunk and a million dangly, branchy limbs that seemed deliberately designed in order to easily grab... *children?*

"I'm the Tree Taker!" he yelled with a booming voice. "And I'll take any kids who don't finish their food! So eat up!"

The kids stuffed the food into their mouths faster now.

"Please don't take us away, Tree Taker!" one cried.

"THAN EAT! YUM, YUM, YUM!"

It was weird, man. For a moment, it almost seemed to me like someone just off-screen was *forcing* the kids to do this. Or... were they just really good child actors?

Regardless, I seriously thought I might be sick. Lucky for us, they saved the worst mascot for last.

"Oh, Jesus!" Pitty audibly wailed as the final character waddled into the frame. Scowler was... well, I'm not quite sure what he was.

The best way I could describe him was a big, pink... *blob,* I guess, wearing a sinister curve in the shape of a permanent frown.

"Everyone, watch out!" yelled Happy. "IT'S SCOWLER!"

"Ahhh!"

The kids all screamed a piercing scream as the pink blob chased them around the restaurant. Their high-pitched voices all warped and warbled as the tape glitched out a bit.

The next bit of the commercial was perhaps the weirdest part. There was no dialogue. Scowler just chased the kids around the place for a solid sixty seconds. And once again, these kids were either giving the performance of a lifetime, or they *really* were terrified for their lives.

I'm not even exaggerating when I say the entire commercial was one of the scariest things I've ever seen in my entire life. Everything about it was wrong. My first honest thought was that I should call the police, but then I realized how completely *insane* I'd sound if I explained the situation.

"Okay, I can't do this anymore," groaned Pitty, now physically looking away from the TV screen. I finally reached forward and stopped the tape, then ejected it.

Honestly, it must've been a full minute or two before we said anything.

"I'm so fucking confused. What does it all mean?" Pitty finally asked.

"To be honest, I have no clue," I admitted. "But there's no way I'm going into work tonight."

"Fuck it," agreed Pitty. "Me either."

\*\*\*

Later that night, I got like *ten* missed calls from Rick after I didn't show up for my usual night shift. I'm assuming Pitty got bombarded, too. But I didn't care. There was no way I was gonna go back to that place until I figured out what was going on.

Since Pitty had left, I'd refused to rewatch the tape (mostly because the idea of doing so alone scared me so much), but eventually, I decided if I was going to uncover this mystery, I should study the commercial in its entirety once more, this time taking notes.

After all, *something* about this tape was important to Jorge. Therefore, it was important to me. And God, there was also the gaping question of where the FUCK Jorge was...

I was about halfway through my rewatch when my phone started buzzing again. At first, I thought it was Rick. Instead, the caller ID showed Pitty.

"Yo. What's up, dude? Is Rick blowing up your phone, too?"

I could hear Pitty breathing on the other end of the line, but he didn't respond at first.

"Dude? Are you there?"

"Yeah," he whispered. "I'm here."

I immediately sat up, sensing something was wrong. "Are you okay? What is it?"

"He... he's here, Matt." The poor guy's voice was shaking and he sounded like he was gonna cry.

"Who is there? Happy?"

I stood up, started pacing around the room.

"No..." Pitty continued, his voice now getting so soft and quiet I could barely understand him. "It's... *Scowler*. He's staring right at me. And I... I'm so scared, Matt. I can't move."

My heart started going crazy in my chest.

"Please help me..." Pitty plead, now starting to cry.

"Get out of there. Now!" I screamed.

"I can't..." he sobbed. "He won't let me..."

My mind raced. *What to do?!* "Text me your address, okay? I'll come right over," I responded, frantic, as I jumped up and grabbed my keys. "Pitty? Can you do that for me, bud?"
