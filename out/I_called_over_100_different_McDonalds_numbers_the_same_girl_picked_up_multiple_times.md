Right so, bit of context, I'm a stupid teenager, that's all there is. I was bored at night at my cousin's house so we spent about 2 or so hours prank calling a bunch of McDonalds numbers that were in entirely different states. I will be using the name because it honestly kinda adds onto the goofs and laughs but I won't be saying what states I called to ensure safety of privacy on both ends.

(Before anything I wanna state these were all harmless little jokes, none of these were any serious and they usually were something along the lines of)

"Hi this is McDonalds speaking how can I help you"

"Hi! Do you guys sell cartons of milk?"

Or

"Hello! Do you guys sell raw chicken meals?"

Just stupid harmless things along that. Anyways, after 5 or so calls we had a really odd conversation that sounded more like an employee who knew us and was messing with us but, I promise this was the first call. This is how it went to the best of my memory.

"Hi this is Jen speaking how may I help you?

"Hello Jen, I'm sorry do you do orders?"

"No."

"Oh, uh, why not?"

"Because I said so."

"Oh okay can I have your number?"

"I have a boyfriend"

"How tall is he?"

"You couldn't handle me"

"Oh I could baby"

*We hang up*

I also want to mention, this was my cousin talking at the time, he sounds quite young compared to me but regardless there of after this we continued calling. We didn't come across Jen for another while but after maybe after 30 minutes (30-50 calls) we found Jen again. This time I was on. I want to state, over our crusade we entirely changed the states we called 3 times, and every call was in a different country. We called the same number multiple times once, and that one occasion is the next one.

I can't remember the exact start of the conversation but it was something dumb, most likely I was asking if they sell singular nuggets or something. Anyways I got the random urge and asked if she wanted to fight, then I hung up because me and my cousin were bursting out laughing. My cousin decided to call back and the same women picked up.

"Hi this is Jen, what do you need."

"Hi Je-"

"YOU WANNA FIGHT"

*she didn't shout it but she just said it in a more serious angered tone, regardless, she seemed to recognise my voice and I started to recognise hers.*

"Yeah come on, fight me outside of *store in our country*"

*She hangs up*

We call back

"Hi, can I help you."

"No"

"I will fight your mother"

*We hang up cause we both burst out laughing*

Then we decided to call one last final time.

"Hi this is McDonalds, how may I help."

"Hello, Is this Jen?"

"Who are you. What do you want."

"I wanna fight Jen, come on, let's go"

*She hangs up*

At this point she seemed annoyed and we wanted to be harmless and not cause genuine stress so we stopped and moved on to the next state. And yes, entire different states. 

Anyways, few calls down the line maybe 20 or so more. We had the first moment where we genuinely were actually confused of how the fuck Jen was appearing everywhere. I was doing a Kermit the frog impression.

"Hello" *as Kermit*

"Hi, this is McDonalds speaking how may I help."

"Hi, I'm curious if you have specials?" *As Kermit*

*The phone gets moved to a familiar voice*

"Hello, how may I help." 

Then Im not sure why but I entirely switched back to my own voice in slight panic 

"JEN, IS THAT FUCKING YOU"

"HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME"

"YOU BITCH YOU THREATENED MY MOM" *srcsm*

*then the other guy takes the phone again*

"Listen here you bitch ass ni-"

*We hang up*

Both of us are severaly fucking confused, but we continue onwards with the mental idea that we are scared of somebody called Jen who seems to be fucking appearing everywhere. Not exact number but I'd say maybe 20 more minutes of calling later we ended up falling into the idea of singing happy birthday, and regardless of who it was, we would say happy birthday Jen. The first time we did this might I add, this was the first time we decided to sing happy birthday to Jen.

*Male picks up*

"Hi how may i-"

*Me and my cousin in unison*

"Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to Jenifer, happy birthda-"

*A familiar voice comes into the phone*

"Hello?"

*I put my mouth on my cousins hand*

"JEN, IS THAT FUCKING YOU"

*Jen responds in an almost sad voice*

"What is this, what do you want, who are you."

She then hung up, seemed like an awkward point to hang up at but she did anyways, me and my cousin were confused as all hell but continued onwards. Then we have to skip to the last call we made, our last interaction with McDonalds Jen. 

*Jen.*

"Hi, this is McDonalds, how may I help you."

"JEN, WHAT THE FUCK, WE HAVE CALLED DIFFERENT BUILDINGS AND STATES HOW ARE YOU-"

*hangs up*

I'm very fucking confused.
We called different places each time, we called different states 3 times, we are very confused.




Also, small update while I was writing this. My cousin said he heard the dog outside but I glanced at his phone when I heard the "dog" because I thought it was fucking Jen. Maybe I'm tired but I swear to fucking god I heard her voice. Is Jen even real? Are we going insane? Who the fuck is Jen??????? God of McDonalds????
