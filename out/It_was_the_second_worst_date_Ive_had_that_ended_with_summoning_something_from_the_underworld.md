 

I’m going to tell this story as it happened, so you know exactly where my head was that night. That’s how Tad rolls.

Did I stalk her online? Hell yeah I did. I like to know what I’m getting before I let anybody in my car. All I can say is from her videos and pics she was banging and she had it in all the right ways. I’ve been having some bad dates, and I think it’s about time things turn around. Everything’s coming up Tad.

I put some time into getting ready for this one. I got Rockstar on repeat to get my head in the game. Long shower, some pushups against the sink in front of the mirror. By the time I’m done, my hair is perfect; just the right amount of product. Alot. I check myself out in the mirror.

Damn Tad.

I put on a white button up, acid wash jeans, and my Docs. I post a pic. I just turned thirty nine, but most chicks think I’m thirty. I take care of myself. The shirt’s tight in all the right places. I've been trying to find the perfect size and material that lets me rip the arms if I flex and move just the right way. It took me a while, but I finally found shirts from Penny’s that are perfect. My closet is full of them.

Classic Tad.

I roll up in the Fusion and screech to a badass stop right next to the curb of the address she gave me. I have the windows down and I’m blaring Animals out of the radio. It’s a Nickelback night. I want to set the tone right away. I lay on the horn and goose the gas a bit. She wasn’t outside waiting for me, but I’ve had such a bad streak of dates that I let it go. She lives in a rich neighborhood, and all the rich assholes that live here are all looking out their windows at me. I give ‘em some finger guns and a wink. Soak it in.

She finally comes running out of that huge ass house. She’s wearing a short black dress. Damn. This girl has no idea how lucky she is.

She jumps in the car. She turns down the music. I let her. She tells me she’s not hungry, at least not for food. She’s got a party she wants to take me to. I smile. It’s all good. Less money I got to spend on her and more that I can save for the next one. I make my michelins smoke before I jet out of the neighborhood. I’m loud, but it's a hell of a show. 

I try to make small talk. I ask her about all those funny flags that were everywhere in her neighborhood. She starts talking about her family; brothers and sisters in the Ukraine or some shit, but I kind of lose my train of thought while I’m staring at her hooters. She video calls one of her friends at the party while I thunder down the road like a friggin boss. Her friend’s hotter than she is. They’re giggling and saying they can’t believe I’m in my thirties. Maybe tonight’s going to be better than I expected. I know from my date’s profile that she’s bisexual, which is a must for Tad even to be interested, because if a threesome is off the table, I walk.

 Jackpot Tad.

I pull up to the party house and it’s in the middle of nowhere. Old house with pillars and shit and the paint is just peeling everywhere. The music they’re playing inside is a little fem for me, lots of wailing and screeching violins, but I’m down.

Tad adapts.

We get inside and I realize that I’m surrounded by nothing but chicks all dressed in black. Most of them are fives and sixes, but there are a few solid eights as well. They all welcome us in and one of them tries to give me a glass of red wine. I pull out my flask and wink at her. I tell her Tad comes prepared. My date laughs and yells out that I’m perfect. Just the guy she was looking for. She gets me.

It doesn’t take long for me to put two and two together. This is gonna get freaky. There’s got to be at least  a thousand candles lighting this place up and there’s curtains over all the windows. There’s some kind of big weird symbol scratched into the wood on the floor, and in the middle of the symbol there’s some kind of altar with leather straps. They’ve got some mounted heads of pigs and goats hanging from the walls and above the huge fireplace there’s some writing on the wall that says, Arise Krthun. My date tells me that they need me for a summoning. I don’t know exactly what that means, but I tell her that sounds dope. It’s obvious what I just walked into. This is some straight up Fifty Shades shit.

The girls tell me to take my shirt off, and I do my stuff and flex my way out of it. They lead me over to the altar and they lay me down and strap my arms above my head. Here we go.

Baller Tad.

They circle around me and my date starts speaking in some weird language, which freaks me out at first, but then I remember something about her family being from some other country. There’s thirteen girls in all. It’s gonna be real hard to satisfy this many women. Then I hear a pop and feel a sharp pain. One of them pushes a knife into my right pec. I start screaming at her that I’m not into the cutting thing, but another one of the girls steps forward and cuts my left pec. They start raising their voices in that weird language which I remember now must be Ukrainian. I’m pulling hard against the leather ties, but they strapped me in real good. I’m bleeding everywhere! I look down at the floor and I notice that the blood running out of my chest is falling into that weird carved symbol on the floor. I watch my blood start to follow the outline of the symbol. 

I’m starting to get lightheaded. Things are happening. I must be hallucinating because I’m losing so much blood. The walls around us begin to grow mold all over them and a gigantic flame comes out of nowhere in the fireplace. The floor starts to shake and then my date leans down to me and tells me to welcome death.

I’m freaking out. I start pulling on the straps. I can break them if I keep trying. The fire is getting hotter in the fireplace and then I see something moving inside of it. It looks like something straight off a Danzig album and it lets out a scream that makes me almost pass out, but instead I shit my pants. The girls back away from me but they keep speaking those words. I’m going to die. I don’t want to die!

Think Tad! Think! What would Vin Diesel do?

They’ve tied my arms above my head, and I can feel my wrists against my hair and then I remember when I was getting ready for this awful date. I say the word, “Product!” out loud without even thinking and I begin to rub the back of my head all over my wrists. If I can just get enough gel on my wrists, I might be able to pull myself out of these straps. 

Something that looks like a leg comes out of the fire followed by another. They’re covered in scales and scars and instead of feet, it looks like hands. Finally I see the thing come completely out of the fireplace and stand directly above me. The horns on its head are scraping the ceiling and it opens its mouth full of yellow cracked teeth and screams at me again. Its arms are moving toward me. Oh my God, it has four arms!

I can feel the front of my jeans flood with piss as I keep rubbing my head against my wrists. Wait! I can feel my hands begin to slide through the straps. I might make it.

The thing reaches down for me just as I slip through the straps and roll onto the floor. The chicks start yelling at each other to grab me, but I stumble forward toward the first covered window I see and throw myself through it. I can hear the giant thing walking on that wooden floor and then the women start screaming. I get up and I look back. It’s eating them and tearing them to pieces. It’s throwing parts of them all over the room. I run for my Fusion. 

Just as I open the door, I think I hear the thing breaking through the wall of the house. I don’t want to be next on the menu. I jump in and crank her over hard and tear ass back toward the highway. I keep looking in the rearview in the dark, praying it didn’t follow me. It takes me another hour to get back to the city. I think about calling the cops, but I don’t. I don’t know if anyone would believe this.

That’s exactly how I remember it. That was three weeks ago, and up to now, I haven’t told anybody. I found out from a buddy that summoning is a bad thing, like I hadn’t already figured that out. I don’t know if that thing is still out there in the sticks, hanging around that old house, but I do know I’m not going to be picking up anymore chicks from Kazakhstan.
