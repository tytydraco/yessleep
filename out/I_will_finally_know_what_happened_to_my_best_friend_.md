This isn’t about me, it’s about her. 

But before that, I need to explain what’s going on. Yesterday I received a package, which was already a little off-putting because I don’t shop online. It had been left there sometime before I opened the door to let my cats out for the day.

Jasper and Stevie was ready to sprint out the door, but they were startled by the box and scampered under the couch to hide.

This whole thing was strange from the start, but from the outside in it probably didn't seem all that weird. 

The box was unmarked cardboard and held shut by an excessive amount of scotch tape. Written in sharpie on the top was *To: \[My Name\]* in big boxy letters. It wasn’t just my first name, which is admittedly pretty common, it also had my last name, so I couldn’t brush it off as something someone had misplaced. This was for me specifically.

Even weirder there was no return address and nothing telling me who it was from. 

So, confident that I wasn’t opening up someone else's package, I went inside and grabbed my car keys which I then used to cut the quintuple layer of scotch tape stuck to the opening.

In retrospect there was no point in opening the package on the doorstep. I had initially thought that if it was like a bomb or something, I’d rather have my porch destroyed than my house's interior. But the amount of jostling I did to the box would have pretty much ensured, if it *was* a bomb, to have gone off in my face.

When I finally got it open, the sight left me with more questions than answers. Inside the box were just stacks of (what I initially thought to be) books. Establishing that this box was no longer a threat, I fled from the summer humidity and took the box inside to where I could more a more comfortable position than squatting on my porch.

I looked at the one of the books located on top. It was located in the top left hand corner. Maybe it's because of how you're supposed to read English from left to right, but the top lefthand corner seemed like the right place to start. 

After flipping through the book realized it was a journal, a very thick, rustled, and grimy journal with handwritten scrawling across every page. More than that it had a familiar name scribbled inside of it repeated over and over again. Sullivan. The surname of my best friend.

With my heart skipping a beat I looked through more journals, each skimming of the pages growing more and frantic as I dug further and further into the pile of threaded pages that had been left to me. I found her name repeated in all of them.

It doesn't take a genius to figure out that these belonged to my friend. There’s a weird feeling in my gut, kind of fluttery and not entirely comfortable. A bit jagged too, like my stomach is tying itself around a rock. 

I don’t know who gave these to me, or why they have been left on my porch step in particular. I can’t help but ask, why me? I feel bad for thinking it, it feels selfish, it is some backwards way. I don’t know. This feels like a calling of some kind and I’m not too keen to answer.

I don’t know what to make of this. I’m worked up and thoroughly freaked out right now. 

I cannot stress enough how panicked I feel at the moment. My heart is throbbing in my chest and nothing I do can calm me down. My hands are shaking and every little noise sends my nerves scattering. Everything feels like it’s being viewed from a hazy mist. Colors are too saturated and the sounds are too loud. Even the quiet is its own kind of unbearable noise.

I keep telling myself to breath, but the air suddenly feels so thick. My thoughts are all jumbled and I can't make sense of the noise.

But it's not the worst part of this whole experience if you can believe it. 

About Sullivan. 

We were next door neighbors growing up and maintained a friendship long into high school even though she moved across the county. I was pretty heart broken when she told me she was moving, but we worked out ways for us to still see each other. It helped that our parents were friends. It gave them more incentive to allow us to hang out. 

Even when we went off of completely different colleges, we still maintained our friendship but the increased distance did add a little strain to communications. We ended up in two different time zones and that made texting difficult.

We were never able to actually hold a conversation, instead we just texted and usually there was a response the next day. It was the kind of slow communication that was both incredibly frustrating, but also had its own kind of humor attached to it. We joked once that even though we’re texting we might as well be sending letters now fast we get replies.

It was about halfway through our freshman years that our talking started to die down and eventually petered off. I thought that she was just finding other social groups and making other friends. It stung a little bit that she didn’t text me anymore, but I wasn’t about to beg for her attention. 

Then I got a call about a month later from my mother, tearfully telling me that Sullivan had been reported missing and her parents had only discovered this because she had stopped attending classes. 

Sullivan basically dropped off the face of the earth one day and is still a missing person even a decade later. I don’t know what happened to her, but I have a feeling that these journals are the answer. 

I haven’t looked at them, there’s a part of me that is scared to do it. It means that whatever is behind is going to be lifted. The truth will come out and I will simply have to deal with the mental fallout if it’s something bad. 

But I will read every page and I will tell the world what happened to Sullivan. 

It’s the least I can do.
