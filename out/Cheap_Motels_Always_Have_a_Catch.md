I promised not to tell what happened, but I can’t keep it a secret any longer. It’s not like the two idiots that caused this will find this post, anyway. It all happened at this retro styled motel in the middle of nowhere Michigan. 

A few weeks ago I received news that one of my closest friends from my childhood had passed away from a work accident. It was a shock to hear, but I was invited to his funeral in Northern Michigan where our hometown was located.

I live in Kentucky now and I don’t have enough to afford a plane ticket, so I figured I would just drive there. The funeral was in the morning, so I’d leave home in the evening, find a cheap spot to stay for a day, and then continue driving to the funeral the following morning. 

But that’s not what happened.

It was around 5am when I arrived at the motel. The highway was backed up from construction, so I had the bright idea to take an unfamiliar exit before I hit traffic. 

The cell service in the area was spotty and my GPS stopped working around the time I had reached unkempt dirt roads hidden beneath a thick ceiling of trees that bent over the road. 

There was practically no light out there, let alone any structures that signified there was anyone within miles. All I could see were the branches that hung over my car like nature's gnarled fingers illuminated by my headlights. 

I was scared like a toddler in a dark hallway, driving cautiously on this bumpy road, too stubborn to turn around because I’ve already traveled at least 10 miles down the stretch of rugged terrain.

And that’s when I saw it, like an oasis in the desert, calling to me with a distant illuminated neon sign. On the outside it was just another rundown motel; bricks coated in greying paint that chipped off the walls, parking lot potholes the size of an asteroids aftermath, and it’s giant sign that twitched and hummed a displayed with its gargantuan glowing lettering; ‘*Annex Assortments Motel*’

I parked in the empty lot hoping to get a room for the night. The drive was stressful on top of the lingering thoughts of my now deceased childhood friend. 

I just needed to rest and clear my mind, to not have to stress about anything but preparing for my friend's funeral, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t cautious enough to scope the place out. 

I was walking around the lot and checking out the building. It had two floors with roughly 8 doors on each floor labeled 101-108 and 201-208 respectively. However, there was a small garage under an isolated second floor room labeled 301 that piqued my interest. 

The room seemed larger, so I walked up the stairs to stare in through the window. Normally this is a creepy thing to do; staring into a random window of a motel room. But like I said no cars means no motel guests.

The lights were still on which revealed what I can describe as an 80's themed interior with expensive, albeit outdated, décor. The colorful linens and smooth wooden furniture conveyed the sense that I could still legally smoke a cigarette in there. It looked like a comfy escape from reality, and I was down to pay extra for the room if need be despite my low savings.

“You know it’s rude to stare in a stranger's window.” A voice called down from below.

The rough, chalky yell came from a balding and burly custodian, pushing a large yellow cart with trash bags flowing over the top rim. I waved to him in apologies and rushed back down the stairs where he waited for me.

“If you’re looking for a room, talk to Patrick at the front desk.” He told me, still irked about what I had done.

I apologized and headed for the front desk where an old man sat patiently. His buttoned flannel sagged over his thin shape and his ginger hair blended into the tacky orange walls of the lobby. His name was Patrick, as embedded on his desk's nameplate.

“Oh? A youngin! We don’t get too many of you down here, especially at this hour.” He said with masked enthusiasm.

“Yeah I was looking at room 301, is it available?” I responded.

“Normally It’s $25 a night for any of the other rooms, but that one’s special. Took a lot of care for that one, I tell ya. It’s extra, $50 a night, counting this one–since it’s still dark out. But it’s scheduled for decoration renovations tonight around… 9 o’clock. You’re gonna have to move to a different room by then.” Patrick warned.

“I plan on staying this morning through tomorrow morning, can I at least get a discount on the room I’m being moved too?” I asked.

Patrick paused for a moment, annoyed, pursed his lips, sighing, outright throwing a silent fit.

“Fine. I’ll make it $65 for your whole stay, how ‘bout that? Just wait for Getty to finish cleanin’ up in there.” He stated.

I agreed, my fatigue from the drive cloaking my enthusiasm. This was practically a steal compared to hotels and motels in any populated area.

Once Getty, the custodian, had finished lugging a large and bulky trash bag down the steps and around the back of the building I headed into my room. I didn’t really get the chance to appreciate the décor, besides a chair that had fallen on its side. I just stood it up and pushed it aside, immediately laying down and going to sleep in the room's queen size waterbed. 

That was until I was awoken by the smell of burning, or more specifically, a clothes iron that the previous visitor left sizzling on their clothes in a closet. 

Now, you may be asking ‘why didn’t the clothes iron’s auto-shutoff feature activate? Well that’s because it was vintage; genuine vintage, capital V Vintage. I’m not exaggerating when I say every single thing in this room had likely been here a few decades before I was born. 

Vintage to the point of annoyance, where form overtakes function and the CRT box television looks uncanny displaying Netflix behind scan lines and a large microwave with fake wood paneling hangs between yellow tiling and plastic fruits that sat in a gaudy glass bowl leaving room for nothing else on the kitchen counter.

The iron that woke me up looked like a giant hunk of metal. I unplugged it without hesitation and set it on the bathroom floor, hoping the hot surface wouldn’t damage the surface. I grabbed the folded white polo and black slacks from the closet to return them to the desk clerk until something fell out of the pants pocket. It was a wallet, its contents splayed open for me to see.

I bent over to pick it up. There was a drivers license for a guy named Lucky: His black hair was clean-cut and his face pointy, 6’1”, brown eyes, born 1959, from Virginia, and issued in 1982. The damn thing expired 40 years ago. I thought this was just a prank by the motel, that they were really leaning into the whole 80s theme, until I saw something else weird. 

There was another license of some sort. It was blue and had another photo of Lucky on it. There was a string of random numbers along the top yet no name. And at the bottom, a very familiar circular seal. *CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY* lined its interior perimeter.

‘Holy shit’ I thought to myself. 

A CIA agent must have been the last person to rent this room decades ago. I understood the customer pool here was pretty low, but that wouldn’t explain the iron burning the clothes only just now. That had to be recently used. So then why does someone have some guy's old license and CIA ID card?

I decided to just take a shower. The funeral wouldn’t be until tomorrow morning, so I still had the day relatively to myself. So I left the do not disturb slip on my door and I went out for breakfast, the closest diner being 11 miles away, before shortly returning back to my motel room.

Upon returning, I noticed the room was off. Not unsettling, but different. Like someone had adjusted a few things. And it seems like they had, because the first thing I noticed was chocolates on my bed and an apology note for the ‘oversight made during the room cleaning’.

I didn’t care about the chocolate; they looked like the cheap ones that tasted like cardboard. I was more annoyed that someone had been in my room even though the do not disturb sign was hanging off the door. I went to complain to Patrick.

“Getty said he saw you leave so there’s nobody to disturb in the first place!” Patrick rebutted.

Patrick explained that while I was gone Getty told him he felt as though he didn’t completely clean the room and wanted to apologize by completing the job. And as an apology from Patrick he would only charge me $25 total for the inconvenience.

I was annoyed, but cheapening the cost of my stay was enough to change my attitude. I chalked it up to Patrick and Getty likely didn’t receive much business, let alone social interactions, and left it be.

For the most part, I spent the rest of my time in the room reading old magazines left on the coffee table, watching some of the VHS tapes stored in a cabinet under the TV, and overall immersing myself in the 80’s room. Also taking a nap, of course. 

It was around sunset when knocking on the front door woke me. 

“Stephen! Time to change rooms! Getty called out muffled by the door.

I had nothing to transfer  to the new room, so I brought the key to 301 to the desk and was handed a key for 103 on the first floor. The room was banal and belonged to the previous decade; not in a good way like 301. I already missed 301’s charm. I decided to wash my only set of clothes instead of pouting over it.

When I got dressed and returned to the bed, I noticed someone walk up the stairs leading to the second story. It was dark out and the figure was poorly revealed in the darkness by the motel's dim exterior lights. But it was enough to tell the man was taller than Patrick and wasn’t wearing those god awful jean shorts like Getty. But he did carry a briefcase, so I assumed it was the interior decorator.

Whether it was curiosity, since for the entire day I’ve been the only person renting a room in this motel, boredom from lack of friends around, or a lingering irrational jealousy that maybe this guy stole my super cool room, I went outside to take a look at him.

I first noticed the parking lot, expecting to see a van full of construction or carpentry equipment, but to my surprise only my shitbox Honda Civ remained alone on the vast ocean of withered concrete. I stepped out into the lot and looked up, spotting the man just before he entered room 301. He was wearing a black suit that concealed him in the night; definitely not an interior decorator.

To me, this meant that the latter of my three options was correct, so I angrily knocked on his door. The man answered, bending his right knee a bit as he stood behind the door.

“Banged my knee on the damn chair.” He said, presumably as to why it took him forever to answer.

“Did the guy at the desk just give you this room to stay–” and then it hit me. White polo, black slacks, black hair, brown eyes. I’ve seen this man before. “Lucky?” I spouted unconsciously. 

Lucky returned a look of confusion, still tending to his knee.

“Woah woah, you weren’t supposed to be here until tomorrow.” He said in a demeaning tone, as if I was a child being scolded.

This really confused me. I thought he mistook me for someone else, so instead of explaining myself, I just unveiled his wallet from my pocket and opened it, displaying his ID cards.

Now he was the child, staring at his wallet with bulging eyes and a mouth wide open with wonder.

“Where’d you get that?” He said sternly.

‘You left it here yesterday before you left, just wanted to return it.” I responded matter of factly.

“You mind coming in for a moment?” He said, opening the door and hobbling out of the way.

If a CIA agent invites you into his room, you can’t really say no. So I picked up the chair he tipped over and sat as he asked me questions.

“What time did you see me leave yesterday? Was I talking to anyone on a radio or cellular device? Was I leaving with anyone?” He said laying a barrage of questions on me. 

He tried to keep his cool with a façade of authority, but I could tell he was jumbled up inside. The way he glanced around at me, how his hand tightened around his knee, Lucky was scared.

“I wasn’t here yesterday.” I told him.

And that was true, I had only arrived this morning and found his wallet and ended up in this mess.

“Don’t leave this room. I’ll be right back.” Lucky said as he disappeared into the bathroom carrying his briefcase with him. I don’t know if he knew that I could see him in there, since there’s a mirror behind the TV at the perfect angle to see into the bathroom, but through the crack in the door I saw him open the briefcase and fist a handful of cash. And then he just bursted out the door.

I couldn’t just sit there after that. Unless you’re a billionaire you’re not just gonna ignore a briefcase that could be full of money. So I walked into the bathroom, looked down at the sink, and sure enough there was, in fact, a briefcase full of money.

Except the money was off. There were hundred dollar bills, but Benjamin Franklin looked… odd. His forehead was larger and his face smoother. Like an egg. The font of the ‘100’ on the bill looked off too; flat and bright instead of dark and textured. The money had to be fake. So what was a CIA agent doing here with a briefcase full of fake money, I wouldn’t know, because that was the last time I would see Lucky alive.

By the time I reached the front desk, Lucky laid dead with a pool of blood forming below his head. I had never seen a dead body. It was so uncanny or incomprehensible? I had just seen him alive, full of energy, and now he lay still with no remnants of ‘Lucky’ still evident. Patrick stood over him, panting, revolver in hand. Getty was bending over him, observing the recently killed Lucky, until he noticed me.

“I told this fat fart it was stupid to let you have the room for the day. You just had to ruin it.” Patrick said, haphazardly waiving the gun around at Getty. “ I guess it’s not your fault, though. You didn’t know.” Patrick said, raising the gun toward me.

“Ooooh, don’t shoot him yet, Pat. Make him drag the body this time–I’m tired of doing it.” Getty said, throwing a tantrum.

Patrick agreed, relaxing the gun, then motioned for me to grab Lucky. He was surprisingly heavy as I gripped him by the shirt under his armpits. I followed Getty out the door as Patrick stayed near, gun still in hand. We walked around the back of the motel and through some overgrowth that looked well traveled through. Trampled tall grass and shrubbery laid flat on the dirt. I saw Getty slow down his walk, so I stopped. Then he reached for something in the grass.

He swung open two large doors, leading down into a dark cellar.

“Just drag him down the steps. And don’t look into the cellar. Just drag him in and come back outside. If you look back, you will die.” Getty told me, carefully pronouncing his words as if I was stupid.

And so I listened, at first. I dragged the body as the dead weight slumped over each step into the dark abyss, inching backward slowly to find my footing. My gaze was locked onto Lucky’s lifeless eyes as he stared back at me from below. His absent look didn’t comfort me much, as if he were telling me from beyond the grave that I was a cowered for not trying to fight back. 

As I stepped deeper and deeper, the light began to retreat. I looked up past the cellar doors which were much farther away now and noticed Patrick aiming the gun at me. He was going to shoot me. Just shoot me and leave me here with Lucky. I was a dead man walking into his own grave–kind of smart of Patrick to think that up, I’ll give him that–I wasn’t expecting someone like him to come up with that idea..

Surprisingly, I was never shot. I came out of this whole thing unwounded. Physically, at least. Because when I turned around, unable to face the revolver's barrel and stare death in the eye, I was met with a new sight. One that will surely stick with me for the rest of my life.

Amongst the cellar was an ocean of corpses; all in varying states of decomposition. Just thrown about resting upon each other. A wild tangle of arms and legs and button ups and black slacks and empty briefcases. And they all had the same face; a wide eyed expression of shock and fear. Only the skeletons were charitable enough to have outgrown that frightful look. 

It’s like they were horrified to see me, to see another body added to the collection. The sight was so horrific and unlike anything any person should witness I totally disregarded one aspect of the corpses. They were all Lucky. Perfect replications of his face, his clothes, his build. All Lucky.  And as I returned my gaze forward, all I saw were the cellar doors closing shut and locking me in darkness.

And I stood there, paralyzed with the collar of Lucky’s shirt in my grasp, knowing what was in the darkness behind. I heard Patrick and Getty debating whether they should go in there and shoot me. The way  they were arguing frantically told me that tonight might’ve been the first time Patrick, or Getty, had killed someone. Or, let alone was involved in a murder. No experienced killer brings up worriedly what the cops will do to them when they ‘find out’ or doesn’t have a game plan to prevent being found out. That’s coming from a nerd who’s interning as a data analyst.

Either way, I wasn’t going to take a chance and realized I needed to get to the far end of the large cellar to avoid the chance for them to shoot me. I have my phone, which is now barely surviving at 5%, so I could have used the flashlight. But honestly I’m glad I didn’t. I don’t know how I could face the reality of crawling through those bodies which were piled atop each other like bags of damp sand and tree branches.

I didn’t realize I had reached the end of the cellar until my nose slammed into the old brick wall. Only then did I gain the courage to turn on my flashlight to find that I was standing on a pile of bones. Makes sense if the oldest bodies were dragged to the back, I guess.

I did find a swiss army knife in one of the many shirts lying around and draped over skeletons. Actually, every shirt here has a swiss army knife in their breast pocket. I don’t know how long I spent trying to think of some plan to escape with it. There was nothing I could think of and I was desperate.

I didn’t know if I’d be shot, left here to die, or what, but my phone was close to dying and the satellite connection feature on new smartphones wasn’t even working down here. No windows to climb out of, no walls to breakdown. There was nothing I could do to escape. I remember thinking to die at the hands of two stupid isolated country bumpkins was a shameful way to go. (No offense to those living in the country). Maybe when I saw my friend in the afterlife he’d make fun of me.

But moonlight spilled over the corpses of Lucky, reminding me once more what had been accompanying me in this cellar this whole time. Getty’s voice boomed over the decaying terrain;

“Come here. I just wanna talk, that’s all.”

I didn’t have any options left at this point. I crawled once again through the bodies until finally reaching the newest dead lucky whose face was solemn compared to the others' painful expressions which triggered a momentary thought of how all the other ones had died.

I saw Getty on the threshold holding a briefcase; Lucky’s briefcase. He handed it to me.

“Take it and get out. Don’t tell anybody what you saw. If you do, we’ll trace your credit card back to your address.” He told me frankly.

And I did take the briefcase. I drove with no destination. The funeral wasn’t for another day. But I just left and drove and drove and drove until I could find some resemblance of a city where I waited in my car doing nothing but staring out the front windshield, staring at the briefcase full of cash, staring at myself in the mirror.

The funeral was a blur, too. No quantity of a stranger’s dead bodies could amount to the emotion and heaviness I felt seeing my friend in a casket. I briefly greeted his family, who I hadn’t seen in over a decade, but after the service I just left. Didn’t even stay for the burial. I couldn’t do it.

You may ask what I’m going to do with the money. In regards to that, I don’t know. It’s just sitting in the attic behind some boxes. I guess if I have to say anything about this, don’t stay at any cheap motels in the middle of nowhere. This might be common sense for some, but for those like me who can’t turn down the cheap price and the circumstantial convenience, there’s always going to be a catch.
