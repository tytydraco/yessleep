I want to start off this post by saying that this is my first post so I am sorry if there are any grammatical mistakes or the story does not make sense at times. 

I remember the first time my dad told me this story and it left me with complete chills. To be fair I have had my own experiences with the paranormal but nothing like this. 

My dad lived most of his life in Cuba before coming to this U.S. At the age of nineteen my dad was attending a school that was like a boarding university where he would stay there during the week and go back home on the weekend. My dad had a very strict math teacher who did not get along with; however on one particular day during the end of the school year he would make it even worse. On this day my dad was sitting in class and the Professor had the radio on blabbering about Fidel and the communist party. I guess my dad thought he was quite the jokester and decided to say some pretty offense things about the government. As many of you already know Cuba is a communist country, and many people there who are brainwashed do not take any opposition of the government lightly a.k.a his Professor. 

Anyways you can imagine that his Professor was extremely pissed. After hearing what my dad had said, she stormed up to him and told him that she would do everything in her power to not allow him to pass the final exam. Well, once my dad heard that he knew that he had messed up badly and for weeks after he tried his best to study; however he knew it was no use. So he decided to take matters into his own hands. 

One of my dad’s bunk mates had told my dad of a man that lived in the outskirts of the city that could help him. To put it simply this man was like a shaman. My dad told me he went to the man’s house that was far away from his school deep in the mountains. As he arrived the man greeted my dad at the door warmly and invited him inside. Before my dad could even explain to the man why he was there it was like he already knew. He told my dad everything that  was going on and why he went to see him in the first place. He told my dad he would help and gave him  a little bag that was filled with dried seeds and others things. I can’t really remember. He told him that on the day of his exam to hold the bag in his hand and to not worry that he would pass the exam. 

Anyways after that, on the day of the exam he did exactly what the man said. He told me that he was flying through the exam and knew exactly what to put. To no surprise, just as the man had said my dad was the only one in his class to pass the exam. 

Now this is where the story gets really interesting. A couple of weeks after this whole ordeal, my dad was off to see his friend who stayed a couple of miles away. He had left during the day however when he decided to return home it was already dark, maybe around 11 or 12. Knowing that he could get in lots of trouble if he was caught out of his dorm at this time, my dad decided to take a short cut through the some crop fields. 

As my dad was walking alone through the dark fields, he heard in the distance the sound of hooves of a horse. My dad rushed to hide behind the tall crops fearing that it was an administrative from his school, a patrol officer,  or even someone that would catch him where he wasn’t supposed to be. As the sound got close all of sudden he see’s the legs of the horse stop right in front of him. He immediately got up accepting his defeat of being caught; however to his surprise it wasn’t any of the three described above.  It was the shaman who had helped him out months ago. My dad in confusion and shock quickly said hello to the man; however all the man did was take off his hat as a sign of greeting and carried on his way. Relieved… my dad continued his way back to his dorm 

Back at his dorm, my dad quickly woke up his bunk mate telling him everything that had just happened. However, when my dad had told him who he had seen in the fields a look of confusion crossed over his face. He asked “who did you see” and my dad replied “the shaman”. Worried and confused he told my dad “You do know that he passed away a week ago right.” Shocked my dad decided that he would never cross those fields again.
