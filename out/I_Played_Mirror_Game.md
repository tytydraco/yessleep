"What's Bloody Mary?" I asked, and that was the exact moment when things started to go wrong in my life. I'd always lived a charmed life, but nothing on me could protect me from what is out there. It's in the darkness, in the glass, like looking out of a window into the night, and something is in the distance, in the sky, something is out there.

What happened to me, how I got this way, that's knowing what that something is. You don't want to know what it is. If you don't know, you can continue with life, and you'll be fine.

Someone told me this is called "information hazard"; I must warn you that you don't want to know what happened to me.

"It is a game. Just a game." Lisle laughed at me, seeing that I looked worried.

"A game involving mirrors?" I asked. Mirrors frighten me. I don't like how I look, my face is uneven, I'm not pretty. I've just always hated mirrors.

"That's right, Canda. If you win, you won't be afraid of anything anymore. Imagine that." Lisle said with a promise in her voice. I shuddered, realizing that fear had kept me from nearly everything I could accomplish. Nothing bad ever happens to me, I always have what I need, like having a best friend like Lisle. But I stay in place, and I never move forward, I am afraid of the mirror and I am afraid of change.

"This game, it is scary?" I asked.

Lisle nodded. "My brother taught it to me, but I never played."

I trembled in trepidation at the thought of Thomas. He was the State Hospital in the psychiatric ward. I worried the mirror game was the same thing that put him there.

"I don't know, Lisle, it sounds dangerous."

"All you do is go into the bathroom alone and turn off the lights and cup your hands around your eyes against the mirror: like this." Lisle made goggles around her eyes with her hands and pressed them against the mirror in her room. "And then you whisper her name while staring into the inky void within the mirror, you say it three times, or more."

"Her name is Bloody Mary?" I asked. I didn't want to do it. I got on my phone and checked to see if it was a real thing. "It says here you're supposed to use a candle and spin in circles and it says nothing about putting your hands between the mirror and your face."

"There's the real way to do it and then there's the fake ways to do it." Lisle shrugged. "Imagine having a slumber party and being the only girl who actually does it. The rest just pretend they did it."

"Nobody ever really does it?" I asked.

"Thomas did." Lisle said strangely.

"Then it's real. Let's not do it. I'm not doing it. Don't do it, Lisle." I said.

"So, you actually believe in - that ghosts and demons and stuff are real?" Lisle asked me incredulously.

"No." I said honestly. I didn't believe in any of that stuff.

"Then it just builds confidence, and girl, that's what you need!" Lisle assured me. "I'll go first, and I'm going to do it for reelzeez."

I sat there feeling weirdly calm, the same way I get when I am about to get a shot or take a test or see a large dog with no owner walking towards me on the street. Nothing bad ever happens to me, so I don't really get all that scared or freaked out, I just get this weird calm feeling. It's a kind of fear, a sort of creeping, unidentifiable fear with no basis on what I am facing, just the instinct of a threat.

Her bedroom was across the hall from the bathroom.

Lisle went into the bathroom and turned off the lights. I listened, but I couldn't hear her saying 'Bloody Mary' or whispering it. A few seconds after she went in she came out with a big grin on her face and told me it was fine. I didn't believe she had actually done it, but I didn't want to call her out.

"Your turn." She told me.

"I already said I wasn't going to do it. I told you not to." I crossed my arms, feeling nervous. I knew I had to go in there, to prove to myself I wasn't afraid. I wasn't sure why I was so hesitant to go in there. The fact is, I was terrified that it might be real.

"That's fine." Lisle shrugged and hopped onto her bed and put on her headphones making a point of ignoring me. I need her approval, it's part of having a best friend, so I give in to her demands. I gave up, got up and went in.

Alone in the bathroom I asked myself if I was going to do it. I don't think anyone ever really does it, I think they laugh at it and treat mirror game like a joke, but it proves to yourself who you really are. Do you believe in ghosts? I ask myself such a question, and I'd have said 'no'. Then I put myself in a test against an ancient demon, and learn that fear is our first defense against things we should not know about.

In the mirror, in the dark. Something isn't right. Something is in there, floating in a darkness - a distant something, coming closer. Will I wait for her? She approaches, from deep within the mirror. Locked into staring at her, I don't look away.

If I look away, I admit she is real, I admit I am afraid. Just a speck in the ink, the light of her image reflecting in my eyes, reflected in the mirror, and it is all darkness. Just this black void, consuming me, rooting me to the spot, gripping me in terror.

She is there, she is real. She is in front of me, she is behind me. She is behind you in the darkness, in the corner of the room. Not the floor, look up, she is there. When you look she is gone, but the darkness remains, the shadow looms.

She groans next to my ear as I lay on my side in bed, a kind of deep creaking noise, like she is a chorus of toads. She touches me in the darkness, her hand as cold as ice. I'd scream but I bite into my own tongue out of panic, tasting the blood.

Where am I? Still trapped in that darkness, that silhouette of a nightmare coming ever closer as I watch, hands cupped between my eyes and the mirror? Did I spit blood all over the mirror when I first bit my tongue?

The pain is sharp and jagged, and familiar. I did bite my tongue when she came. And I did it again when she touched me, in the darkness, alone in my bedroom.

I see her moving across the floor, silently approaching me, my nightlight shows me the horror of her ragged visage. She is not of this world, she never was. What we are, we are just creatures who are here right now. She is always, she was always here.

This I suddenly know, by instinct. What does Thomas know? I'd go ask him, but they wouldn't let me out of my room. It is dark in there, and she comes to me and sits with me and I slowly turn around and around in circles.

They let me back out. I am here, I am there. I go home, but that moment,

"What's Bloody Mary?" haunts me.

When I look at her face, I see nothing. She has no face, there is nothing there. She is looking at me, I can feel it. She is looking at you, too, but you cannot feel it.

Whatever you do, don't look back.

Don't play mirror game.
