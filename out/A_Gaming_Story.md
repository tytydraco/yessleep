PROPERTY OF *REDACTED* POLICE DEPARTMENT. ANY UNAUTHORIZED VIEWING OR RECORDING OF THIS DOCUMENT WILL RESULT IN INTERNAL AUDIT.

Reporting Officer: Kennedy, Maya. 

Department: Homicide.

Date of report: *REDACTED*

Location of incident: *REDACTED*

Officer Notes:

I arrived on the scene first. Just the responding officer was present. I approached him and he was clearly shaken up. This is a small town, they dont get this kinda thing. He told me where the body was and I entered the residence at approximately 2:15 am. The mother was distraught. Anyone would be after losing a child. Especially that way. The child was sitting facing the television wearing a VR type headset. As a fellow gamer. I have never seen this one before. No signs of trauma to the body. Until we removed the VR headset revealing the victims eyes have been gouged out. We could not decide if it was done by the victim themselves or something else. I then looked at the system. The only lettering on it was a trademark for a company called Visual Nightmares. Any searches for the company came up with nothing. Possibly a front. This is when the situation happened. Im assuming out of curiosity the responding officer placed the VR headset on. He was normal for a few moments before he began to scream. Something about “how are you back. We got rid of you” then he turned into almost like a child, screaming “no daddy please no” before ripping out his own eyes. He bled to death before help could arrive. I now have the system. Im gonna try it later under observation. Wish me luck.

Case observations done by: Oliver, Viktor.

Subject: Gaming System Experiment. Previously lost on arrival to *REDACTED* facility. 

Observations:
The system that was lost by the person who shall not be named and who was swiftly dealt with has recently showed results on outside subjects. If there was one plus side to this it was the accidental use of unwilling human subjects. First subject was a child, as intended the machine drew him in with its simple horse racing AI we programmed for the purpose to lore subjects. The program then did its primary function in showing the subjects greatest fear. Kids greatest fear was losing his mother. Simple for a child so young. The next was a police officer who put on the headset following the investigation of the first subject. He then saw his father. Searches show his father was sexually abusive to him and his mother. He went to prison when the mother finally woke up. The last was the detective herself. Her greatest fear was the most interesting of all. Getting sent to prison. Being locked up with alll those people she put away. Turns out the girl was dirty. Was under internal investigation. We will send in a crew to get the system. We will clean this up. I willl continue working on the phone experiment.
