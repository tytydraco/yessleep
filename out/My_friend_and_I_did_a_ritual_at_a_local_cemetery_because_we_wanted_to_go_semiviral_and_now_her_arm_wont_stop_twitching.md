There's a dumb trend going around my high school. You try to earn, "points," by doing, "scary stuff." Example, you go to a cemetery after midnight, that's 5 points. Every hour you stay after that, you earn more points. The scarier the situations you put yourself in, the more points you earn. There's not really a system or leaderboard in place, but it all gets posted to this local, private Instagram for bragging points. 

My friends, Tre and Emma, wanted to do something that would get the most likes on the page. We got together last Saturday and put our heads together. After a few drinks and half a joint assembled from the leftover weed I had, we came up with something that we thought was special.

At 3:00 AM we went to our local cemetery. We went deep enough in where we figured no one would bother us. Sitting under the moon, we grabbed our materials, which consisted of:

A wooden plaque with a pentagram carved into it. 

Five candles. 

A book Emma found from the library which consisted of, "Demon names."

A small razor. 

A pocket bible. 

Emma started to record on her phone as we set it up. No commentary, either. We wanted to create something really scary. And not bullshit, either. 

We set the plaque down on some random grave, lit the candles and put them on top of the points of the pentagram, then we all sat down. We each made a small cut on our hands, wiping the blood into the grooves of the pentagram. We all got splinters. 

Tre opened the bible.

"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none." He read. 

We tried to find any quote that would add to the atmosphere. He put the bible in his back pocket. 

Emma grabbed her book with one hand, recording with the other. She started to say Demonic names. None of which I can remember. Tre and I closed our eyes during this to add to the atmosphere of it all. 

After whispering their names, she said, "Make your presence known."

Nothing happened. We sat in silence for a bit. Looking at each other, unsure of what to do, Tre suggested we all put our cut fingers on the blood in the middle and do it all over again. It'll look cool for the video, he said. So, we did. 

Emma started reading the names again. Wind started picking up and I swear we started to hear noises all around us. Emma put her phone down for a second. We checked in with one another, like, "We're just high, dude. There's no noise, you're tweaking." 

And then one, single candle blew out. We DIPPED. Literally, I've never run faster in my entire life. We left the candles, the board, everything there. Except the book of demons, anyway. 

We drove to the nearest Mcdonald's, grabbed some burgers, and talked about what just happened. 

"It was just the wind."

Emma edited together the video the next day, sending it to the Instagram. They posted it and we got the most likes out of anyone on the page. The people who followed the page texted us, giving us props. We all couldn't wait till Monday at lunch to spill the details in person.

The weird thing was, Emma didn't show up to lunch. She didn't text back through the day, either. Tre and I were worried, so went to her place after school. Her mom let us in, telling us she didn't feel good. Entering the room, you could smell the sickness on her. But she didn't look sick at all. 

"What the fuck are you guys doing here?" She yelled at us when we came in, er head sticking out from the blanket. 

"We're worried about you." We said. 

She went completely under the blanket. It looked like she was wrestling with a pillow trying to get comfy. 

We sat next to her.

"Go away! Seriously!" She started to cry. 

We took off the blanket. Her right arm kept... convulsing. It was really ragdoll physic-y. She just kept snapping it to the side like it had no bones inside of it. You know when someone on a bike signals to turn by stretching their arm out to the right or left? It kept doing that. 

She screamed at us, throwing herself under the blankets again, so we left. She didn't talk to us for a few days. We gave her space. Until last night. 

She called me, asking if I'd meet her at her place. We decided not until after dark. 

It was 9pm when she walked out to the car. Her arm still twitching out to the right. 

"I tried Tre, he's busy." She said.

The reality is, Tre moves between circles. He's a popular dude. And tonight, he didn't want to deal with the girl who screamed at him the other day. 

Her arm started to twitch. Except this time, it twitched forward. 

"Why's it-" I asked, but she cut me off.

"When I went to the hospital the other day, they did all sorts of tests, physical bullshit. They said it's mental." She said.

She continued.

"When we went, every time we made a turn, my arm twitched in a different direction. It's like.... I'm sounding crazy, Matt. Seriously, I need to know you aren't gonna make fun of me or anything." She pleaded.

I promised her I wouldn't.

She struggled with her words.

"I want you to take me in the direction it twitches toward." She said. 

Without a word, I drove. I don't know shit about mental health. The school tries to teach us stuff, but I really don't know the nitty gritty. But, in that moment I thought, "my best friend suffered a mental break."

I didn't critically assess her well-being. My brain might've thought she was losing it, but my gut.... my gut told me to listen to her. So, we drove in silence. Her arm twitching in different directions every so often when we came to dead ends or turns. We drove and drove. Until we met our destination. Her arm stopped twitching, it held out in front of her like a sign pointing where to go. We were in front of the cemetery. 

I figured she was recording. I looked everywhere for a camera, a phone, anything. She promised me she wasn't. She started to cry. I hugged her, half-believing her. 

I told her, her mind was playing tricks on her. She needs to relax, get some sleep. Me, her and Tre will go back tomorrow. We can't do this tonight, not so early and just the two of us. The reality is we could've, but I was scared shitless. 

I asked her if she's able to sleep. She said she's got that taken care of, pulling a bottle of shitty vodka from beneath her sweatshirt. I was in no place to judge. Hell, if my arm was pulling me in every direction, I'd be doing the same thing. 

We agreed to come back the next day. Tonight. 

I stayed home from school today. I couldn't sleep thinking about it all. I didn't tell Emma that, though. I'm really worried. I've never really seen someone lose their mind like this; you know? I mean, if it's real. If it's just mental. But if it isn't? That only leaves it being a prank. There's no way anything came from us doing that ceremonial bullshit. Right?
