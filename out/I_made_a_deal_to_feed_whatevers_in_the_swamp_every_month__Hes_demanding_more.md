———————————————————————

I promised I’d keep writing, so here I am again.

I went to the swamp for the third time last night. I did something I can’t take back. No matter how hard I scrub, the smell of swamp and blood won’t come off my hands. I don’t think I can ever be the same person after what I did.

But I can’t talk about that yet. I said I’d write this down as it happened, and I need to start where I left off.


I got four hours of sleep that night, if that. I tossed and turned, unable to get comfortable. My body felt heavy when I dragged myself out of bed and fumbled into my clothes. By the time I stepped outside, the morning air felt thin and unreal.

That’s when I saw it—a $100 bill lying on the mat in front of my door. Crisp. Clean. Except for a dark green smear on one corner.

I rubbed my thumb across it. The smear peeled away in a single clump, cold and soft, and hit the floor with a dull little thump. For a moment I swore the smell of swamp water rose up around me.

It didn’t take me long to connect the dots. His words from last night echoed in my head, sticky and putrid as the swamp air: Gold in your pockets, luck on your back.

A shiver ran down my spine, and the bill suddenly felt heavier in my hand, like it was trying to anchor me to the spot. My chest tightened and my heart thumped as I turned it over and over, searching for something—anything—to prove it was just coincidence. But besides the green smear, the paper looked as crisp and innocent as if it had come straight from a bank.

I slid the bill into my wallet without thinking and walked to my car. My hand went to my chest as I sank into the driver’s seat, lungs struggling to pull in air that felt far too thick.

“It’s okay. Come on, Kyle, get a hold of yourself.” My voice sounded too thin in the small space of the car. I gripped the wheel until my knuckles turned white and then forced myself to breathe, slow and shaky.

I started the engine and shifted into reverse. For a split second, in the mirror, I thought I saw ripples run across the puddle at the edge of the street, like something had just slipped beneath the surface.

On my way to work the dollar bill gnawed at me like a splinter you can’t quite get out. By the time I got to work though, things started to change.

It was a weekday—meant it was slow, or it usually did. But my section stayed nearly packed all day. Every table tipped like they had money to burn: twenties, fifties. One guy even left a crisp hundred under his water glass. Too clean. Too sharp. Just like the one waiting on my doorstep. My hands shook when I pocketed it—reminding me it was tainted money.

My manager caught me before my shift ended, clapping me on the back. “Kyle, I’ve heard a lot of good things about you lately. The customers love you, and I think it’s time we start discussing a lead position with a raise.” He sounded like he’d been reading off a script—but his eyes held something new. Respect. Maybe even pride.

My coworkers were different too. A couple of them who’d never said more than a word laughed at my jokes. And when I stopped at my last table, the blonde in the corner leaned in closer than she needed to and slid her receipt into my shirt pocket. A number scrawled on the back. A sharp smile on her lips.

By the end of my shift my pockets felt heavy, dragging with me as I walked out. I should have been ecstatic. Instead, a quiet dread settled deeper in my chest. Every bill smelled faintly of fish, like they were left too long in a tackle box. When I stacked them in my hand, they felt cold. Damp. No one else seemed to notice—or if they did, they didn’t care.

When I got back to my apartment I threw my wallet and keys on the counter before collapsing onto my bed. The fact that I got no sleep the night prior was finally catching up to me. I laid on my bed listening to the rhythmic tick of the clock while I sorted my thoughts about the day out. 

My manager promoting me, the girl giving me her number, and an insane amount of tips too. It felt like a once-in-a-lifetime kind of day. I took a deep breath as I took my phone out and texted the girl from the restaurant. I stared at the screen for a couple seconds waiting for a reply before putting my phone down and taking a shower.

About halfway through my shower, my foot slid out from under me. I went down hard, tailbone cracking against the porcelain as water sprayed over me. A raw curse tore out of my throat as I scrambled upright, skin stinging.

That’s when I saw it. The drain burbled like something alive, and a thick clump of algae pushed its way up against the stream of water. Slimy strands spread across the floor of the tub, slick and green, sticking to my skin. The smell hit a second later—stagnant, swampy, impossible to ignore.

My chest locked up, and for a moment all I could hear was water pattering against the mess, sounded like voices gurgling just beneath the surface. I reached for the handle and shut the shower off. Silence dropped heavy around me, broken only by the faint slurp of the drain pulling itself clean again.

When it was over, there was nothing left but water pooling around my feet. Clear. Harmless. Like it had never been there. I staggered out of the shower before bracing myself against the wall and taking deep breaths—trying to stop my pounding chest. 

I wrapped a towel around my waist and pressed the heels of my hand against my eyes. Black spots dotted my vision as I tried to calm myself down and regain composure. 

The smell of swamp clung to me no matter how hard I tried to get rid of it. No matter how hard I tried to shake it off, the thought persisted, did he know where I lived? Could he find me anywhere?

My phone buzzed, and I held onto the sound like a rope pulling me out of mud. It was the girl from work. “Nice talking to you today. Maybe we can do it again sometime?”

I typed back quickly, hands still trembling. “Yeah. I’d love that.”

The swamp smell faded as I set my phone down. For the first time that day, I almost felt normal.

I won’t bore you with the details of the following weeks. Nothing important happened—at least, nothing tied to him. Life after that didn’t change much. Not like the first day. But it was better. Subtly better. My wallet was never empty, people seemed to treat me with more respect, and little strokes of luck followed me. Not miracles or lottery wins—just enough for him to remind me he was keeping up his end of the bargain. And every time it happened, no matter how small, I felt his eyes on me.

Eventually, the day I was dreading came. It was time for me to do what I had to. I went to the store in the morning and picked up a few roaster chickens per his request for white meat. I set the chicken in my fridge before I left for work. The day played as the ones beforehand, slight improvements here and there, until it was dusk.

By the time the sun slipped away I was putting all the chickens into heavy duty trash bags to make them easier to carry. As I walked out my back door and stared into the swamp my heart wouldn’t stop pounding. Every step brought the thump of my heart along with it. Cicadas screamed as I stepped on the trail—handles on the trashbag drawn so tight my fingers fell numb. 

The cicadas went silent when the trail turned to water. My breath caught in my throat. The swamp looked the same as it always had—dark water, mossy vines, moss hanging in heavy clumps—air too thick to breathe, but it wasn’t the same, not now. I sat the bag on the wet muddy ground and wiped the sweat from my forehead with a shaky hand. The silence deepened, no wind, no animals, just waiting.

“Mmm, look at you, boy. Learnin’ proper. White meat, just how I like it.”

He shifted closer, whiskers dripping black. “Easy, ain’t it? Feed a friend, and that friend feeds you. Folks smilin’ atcha, pockets fat with bills… das me. All me. My gift, from my swamp to you.”

He pressed his hand to the bag, bones snapping wet beneath it. His grin widened. “But white meat don’t fill a belly long, non. Das a snack. A nibble. You keep walkin’ dis trail, you gon’ see what a real meal looks like. Next time, bring me somethin’ breathing, won’t ya? And while you’re at it, I’m gettin’ hungrier. Come back in two weeks.”

I froze at what he said. Something breathing. Two weeks. I had no clue what I was going to do.

Grease ran down his chin as he chewed, humming low. “Mm. Das good. Das real good. You gon’ make me proud yet.”

I swallowed hard, my voice catching before my question finally came out. “Was that you… in my apartment? The shower. The algae in the drain.”

For a moment, the swamp was still. Then his whiskers twitched, dripping inky strands that curled down his chest.

He grinned, too many teeth showing flat in the dark. “Heh. Dat was me, cher. Jus’ tappin’ on the glass. Remindin’ ya who holdin’ the ropes. Don’t want ya gettin’ cozy.”

The air thickened, hot and wet in my lungs. My chest hurt just standing there, hearing him say it like it was nothing.

He leaned close, breath rolling out sour and sweet at once. “A man gotta know his place. You know yours now, don’tcha?”

I nodded, because I couldn’t make my mouth work.
Satisfied, he straightened and slid backward into the water. As he sank beneath the surface, a low humming rose up—wet and warbling, a tune without words. It sounded older than language, older than the swamp itself.

It vibrated through the mud, through my ribs, until it was shaking something deeper than bone. My knees buckled, and I clutched at the trees just to stay standing while the ripples swallowed him whole.

Even after the water went still, the humming lingered in my head.

It hasn’t stopped since.
