**(TW: Suicide)**

I can’t tell yesterday from tomorrow. I don’t really care about the future anymore, as I don't believe I have one.

Each evening, I head home in a car that no longer breaks down every week. Most nights I drink vodka (I’ve discovered champagne sucks) in an apartment that overlooks the skyline. I forget to eat, as my body doesn’t ask me for food anymore. I don’t mind it. 

When I have it in me, I walk the midnight streets. The city lights lead me as swarms of graffiti follow and wandering voices take New York hostage. I stop at corner stores to try to distract myself. I’ll buy a can of Pringles or a Pepsi or some other shit that is in my direct sight. The cashiers in the stores talk *at* me. I’m a thousand miles away as I stand right in front of them. 

Then the mornings come, and I am no longer a spirit of routine. Each shift is like some TV episode I’ve already seen too many times, but somehow I find myself caring about things. The phones and computers become a little portal that sucks me out of myself. The first thing I think of after getting a sale is how I’m gonna get another one.

“Congratulations, Jude!” Sam greeted me one morning.

“For what?” I think it was the first time I had genuinely smiled in a while.

“Your promotion,” Kain scoffed as he filled a little plastic cup up at the water cooler. He’s been here longer than anybody else, but he's never really proved himself. “You're the assistant manager, now.” 

“I’ve trained you well,” Luke said, giving me an awkward side hug. He was the human embodiment of spearmint gum and too much cologne. 

For the rest of the day, I sat idly at the same old desk facing the same computer as the same old people marched past the glass door. The only difference now was that my nameplate had *Assistant Manager* etched into it with my name scratched off. 

“I have an errand I need you and Evelyn to run,” Sam huffed that same day. A large stack of packets blocked out her face. “Meet her outside, she’ll fill you in.”

I didn’t talk to Evelyn much. By the time I’d begin my shifts she was already there, perched at her desk and shouting at people on the phone. We’d trade each other polite close-mouthed smiles, and once in a while we’d even get a “good morning” thrown into the mix. Every time I passed by her, my face would grow hot, and boiling pumps of rage would crawl through my blood. Even mere hellos were eggshells I had to dance through. 

Now I was to be alone with her for an ungodly amount of time doing something I *never* thought I’d do in my life.

She had one of those turkey necks old people got for living too long with a voice only Marlboro Reds could make. Makeup smoothed her face, a blouse always wrapped around her body, and she walked with a mafioso swagger. She bathed in harsh perfume, a smell she never changed as people were probably too afraid to tell her otherwise.

“Congrats on your promotion!” She sang out as I barely stepped out onto the sidewalk. The summer heat rested on my shoulders. The air was a cocktail of street food, exhaust fumes, and trash. 

“Thank you,” I said as we walked. “I’m still kinda shocked I got it so soon.”

“Nooo,” She sorta said in the way a stereotypical ghost would moan. “You should be shocked you didn’t get it sooner.”

"So, what are we doing?” I had trouble keeping up with her pace.

“Eh, so there’s a guy we’ve been trying to close a deal with, and he’s been really reluctant. You know the kind.” She said, as if I knew the kind. “We just gotta pressure him more, and you’re good at that.”

“I don’t pressure people,” 

“You wouldn’t be assistant manager if you didn’t, *honey*.” She said. I recoiled at the ‘honey’.

We were standing in front of a 24-hour bodega and evening had approached in the callous way it often did. Masses of people had walked up and down the block that night, and as soon as they would see us, they would cross the street. Not out of politeness.

“You people are crazy!" A guy, probably around my age, shouted. He was wearing a white Baruch college t-shirt.

“*You’re* crazy if you think most people even know you exist,” Evelyn spat. Her saliva splashed my eyes. It was pulpy with crumbs of god knows what. I wiped it away. “How much could a world of 8 billion people really care?"

“It'll get better, I just gotta keep going.” The guy said it in a way that made me almost believe him.

You know when you feel so fucking awkward so you go on your phone and pretend to text someone? I was off to the side a bit, pointing my new shoes in a different direction and burying my head into my lock screen.

A feeling of injustice began slowly preying on me. All the memories of being dismissed washed over me, like the time people somehow made it about themselves after telling them my brother died or all the times my parents told me I needed to take my pills after I said almost anything to them. 

“Jude,” She flicked my forehead, dragging me back into the conversation. “You graduated like a year ago. Tell him,”

“Things don’t ever get any better,” I said. I barely looked at him as I shoved my phone into my pocket. “The world only exists to fuck you over.”

“What?” Some form of naivety began to drain from him.

“I went to college. It does nothing."  I began to befriend a rage that only one near extinction could feel. The words plopped out of my mouth. “Nothing makes sense. Here you are draining your money, hoping for a normal future, yet you don’t even have a chance at one. You’ll work some meaningless job, marry someone you only halfway love, and have a few stupid kids. Then those stupid kids will grow up just to be like you. You’ll fill up the days with pointless hobbies to distract yourself from the fact that this is all for nothing.”

A bus’s brakes hissed, deep bass pounded past our ears as cars drove by, and the heat hung over us. It was a beautiful night as a full moon governed the sky. A star or two presented itself, fighting the pollution of store signs and headlights. Evelyn was smiling.

“I’ll be okay,” He whispered as though he were the only person standing there.

“Is that what your therapist said?” I laughed. His face reflected on the Bodega’s window. It looked a lot like mine.

It was a bit after 1:00. My eyes were heavy, and every muscle was relaxed. I was watching YouTube on my living room TV and decided to just crash on the couch for the night. The vastness of the room had become my norm, and I closed my curtains to the skyline. 

A few hours later I awoke to a shuffling sound in my kitchen.

“Stop. He can hear us,” a voice whispered.

A type of fear that I could describe as syrupy sat at the bottom of my stomach. The animal in me wanted to get up from the couch, to bash and punch, to yell, to raise a knife to a threat. Yet something within told me to keep my eyes closed and pretend to be asleep. 

You know that feeling when you're falling in a dream and you wake up because it feels as though your heart nearly stopped? I felt like that and thought that if I didn’t move, I’d die or something. I wiggled my fingers and scrunched my toes a little bit. 

“Soon he will realize.” Another one gasped. Its voice was all grainy and raspy, it sounded as though someone had dropped gravel down its throat. 

My consciousness shriveled as exhaustion dragged me away. I’m not sure if it was instincts or stupidity. 

The next afternoon, Sam rushed to my desk. She waved her phone at me, excitement intoxicating her. 

“I’m so proud of you!” She then flashed the screen at me. It was a news article.
