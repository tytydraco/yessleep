It’s been four nights since I posted.
I’ve read every comment. Every message. Every warning. I didn’t expect it to get so much attention, and honestly, I’m grateful — even to the ones who said I was lying or losing my mind. Part of me wishes they were right. That would be easier.

I thought sharing this might help… I don’t know, release it somehow. Give it shape. Make it stop.

It didn’t.

The voicemails still come. Every single night. 3:16 a.m. Not a minute before, not a minute after. I used to bolt upright when it happened, heart in my throat, breath caught. Now I just lie there and wait for the buzz. Like a ritual. I don’t listen anymore — not all the way through. I just let them pile up in my inbox, collecting like dust in a forgotten room.

But last night… I couldn’t ignore it.

It started with Emma’s voice again. Soft. Wavering. The way she used to sound when she was trying to be brave but needed me.
“I’m scared, Daddy,” she said. “He’s getting closer. I can’t hide here much longer.”
Then static — sharp and sudden. It hurt my ears through the speaker. Then something I couldn’t quite catch. A whisper, slurred or maybe layered over itself, like multiple voices saying the same thing out of sync. Then I heard it:

A clicking.

Like fingernails tapping glass. A slow, deliberate rhythm. One-two… pause… one-two-three. I didn’t recognize the pattern, but it felt intentional — like something trying to signal. Or get my attention. Then it just… stopped. Dead silence.

I didn’t sleep. Couldn’t. I waited for dawn like it was a promise.

This morning, I checked the house. Every window had scratches. Thin, fine marks, like something sharp had traced lines across the glass. Some of them were so high up I needed a step ladder just to get a closer look. I live alone. I have no pets. No trees brushing the house. No explanation.

And then, out front — in the grass near the road.

That road.

I saw something caught on a low branch by the ditch where the accident happened.

It was a piece of fabric. Blue. Faded denim. Torn in a pattern I knew too well. I ran inside and climbed into the attic, yanked the old sealed storage box down with shaking hands. Her jacket — the one she wore the day she died — was still inside. I keep it for the smell. The memory. It’s zipped in a vacuum bag, untouched since the funeral. I opened it, just to be sure.

The tear in the shoulder matched exactly. But the one outside…
It looked new. Like it had just been ripped. No dirt. No weathering. No fading from sunlight. Not even dew. Fresh, clean fabric.

That was the moment I stopped pretending I could logic my way through this.

Tonight — just an hour ago — something changed.

It wasn’t a voicemail.

It was a text.

From her number.

Just two words:

“Come outside”

No punctuation. No context. Just that.

I won’t lie — I stood there with my phone in my hand for what felt like forever. My thumb hovered over the screen like I was going to reply. My heart wasn’t racing. It wasn’t panic. It was something worse — that warmth. That aching familiarity.

It felt like her.
It felt like those nights she used to crawl into bed after a nightmare. Curl against my chest. Her breath slow and even as she drifted back to sleep. I could almost feel her weight again. Her little hand tangled in my shirt.

I almost opened the door.

My hand was on the knob when a phrase someone had commented came back to me like a jolt of cold water:
“If she ever asks you to go somewhere, don’t.”

I stopped.
I turned off the porch light. I waited.

And then, I looked.

Just a quick glance through the curtain — but I saw something.

At the edge of my driveway.
Small. Still. Dressed in a blue jacket.

Her size. Her shape.

But too still. Like a photo standing upright in the dark.

I blinked.
Gone.

No sound. No movement. Just the soft hum of the streetlight overhead and the sudden certainty that something out there knew I was watching.

I don’t know what this is anymore.

I don’t know if it’s my daughter… or something that remembers her better than I do.

But I do know this:
It wants to be let in.
And it does not want to be ignored.

I’ll update again…
If I’m still here.
