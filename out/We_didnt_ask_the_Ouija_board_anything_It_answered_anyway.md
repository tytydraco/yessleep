The planchette started moving before any of us touched it.

I know how that sounds. I know every Ouija story starts with someone swearing they didn’t push it, that’s not what this is. My hands were still in my lap, so were Jenna’s and Marcus’s. We hadn’t even finished arguing about whether this was a stupid idea. The board was already spelling something.

S-T-O-P

Jenna laughed, sharp and nervous. “Okay, who’s messing with us already?”

No one answered. The candle between us flickered hard, bending like something had breathed on it. The room smelled faintly of burnt matches and dust. We were sitting on the floor of my flat, lights off, windows closed. It was just after midnight, Marcus’s idea, because “that’s when it’s supposed to work.”

The planchette slid again.

N-O-T Y-E-T

My stomach tightened. “That’s enough,” I said, reaching forward. “We haven’t even.”

The planchette snapped to the center of the board so fast it knocked the candle over. Wax spilled across the letters, hissing softly as it hit the floor. The room went dark except for the faint glow from the streetlight outside.

Something shifted in the corner. Not a shape, not a shadow. Just the sense that the corner was suddenly… occupied.

Marcus swallowed. “Okay. Joke’s over.”

No one laughed this time. I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. The beam cut across the walls, the couch, the door. Everything looked normal, too normal. The kind of normal that feels staged, like a set after the actors have left.

When I lowered the phone, the planchette had moved again.

H-E-L-L-O

Jenna’s hands were shaking now. “We didn’t say hello.” 

The board answered anyway. I felt a pressure in my ears, like when you change altitude too fast. The air in the room went thick, hard to breathe. I became acutely aware of the sound of our breathing, three uneven rhythms trying to pretend they weren’t panicking.

“Who are you?” Marcus asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

The planchette dragged itself slowly, deliberately, as if whoever was moving it wanted us to feel every second.

N-O-T W-H-O

The candle flared back to life on its own. The corner of the room darkened, swallowing the light. I had the sudden, overwhelming urge not to look directly at it, like my brain was throwing up warning signs faster than I could process them.

“What do you want?” Jenna asked.

The board paused. Then the planchette slid in a wide, looping circle before settling on the letters.

Y-O-U D-I-D-N-T A-S-K

The temperature dropped. Not gradually, instantly, my breath fogged in front of my face.

“I think we should stop,” I said. “You’re supposed to say goodbye, right?”

The planchette jerked hard, scraping against the board.

T-O-O L-A-T-E

The lights in the flat flickered on. All of them, every lamp, every overhead light. Even the one in the bathroom down the hall. In the sudden brightness, I saw something I hadn’t before, there were fingerprints on the board.

Not ours. They were pressed into the wood around the planchette, too many, overlapping, some too long, some bent at impossible angles. They looked burned in, dark and permanent, like the board had softened just long enough to accept them.

Jenna screamed. The planchette shot across the board and landed on the word GOODBYE, cracking the wood beneath it. The lights went out again, when they came back on, the board was blank. No fingerprints, no cracks, no planchette.

Just cheap printed cardboard and a stupid plastic surface that suddenly looked harmless again. We didn’t talk about it after that, we cleaned up in silence and went our separate ways. I tried to sleep, I  failed.

At 3:17 a.m., my phone buzzed. A notification from an app I didn’t have.

VOICE MEMO – NEW FILE

I stared at it for a long time before pressing play. Static filled the speaker at first, then breathing, three breaths, not mine. Then a voice, close and quiet, like someone leaning down beside my bed. “We said hello.” My screen went black.

The room didn’t feel empty anymore.
