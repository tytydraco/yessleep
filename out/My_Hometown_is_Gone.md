I can hardly describe driving through the complete devastation of my hometown.

We passed dozens of familiar homes from over the years. Some of them had bullet holes. Some had bent frames or broken glass. Some had dead bodies in their front yards, and I tried not to look at those too long, because I knew the faces, but it’s hard to stop yourself from looking once you start, you know?

I saw Alice. I saw Mr. Hallow. I saw neighbors. I saw friends. Some of them died running. Some died fighting. But all of them seemed to end up the same way… in scattered bits and pieces, cast like trash, almost decorating their own immaculately made front lawns. 

My father drove the car. Only one road led us out of town, but it passed through a few hiccups along the way. The supermarket on Grand Street sat behind two apartment complexes that tended to be crowded. The gas station on Main would allow us to fill up, but they didn’t call it Main for nothing, and more people would almost certainly lead to more problems. 

All of these issues swirled around my head in unison with the backdrop of my entire town carved up like origamis right in front of my face. 

And my dad didn’t even seem phased by it. 

He actually hummed for the first ten minutes of the trip. My dad is not the type to hum. At first, I thought it might be a nervous thing, but then my mother started to join him. 

“Guys?”

Mark glued himself to the car window. He wouldn’t look at me. Not even a shared glance of misery. I knew from his reaction that something bad was about to happen. I guess I just didn’t want to admit it to myself. 

“Dad?”

My father slowed down around the grocery store. He pulled into the lot unceremoniously, as if it were any other Tuesday, while the corpses of our neighbors lined the streets among us, clearly baking in the heat of the rising sun. I actually thought we hit one of them. 

“What are we doing?” I asked.

Nobody answered me. 

“Hello?”

My father parked the car. He leaned over to give my Mom a peck on the forehead. She nodded and smiled back. After a moment of silence, he gingerly unclipped the seatbelt and moved to get out. Nobody bothered to stop him.

“Dad?” I shouted. “Wait, are you serious? You can’t go out there.” 

He smiled at me one last time. Looking back… I like to think there was still some small part of my dad in that smile. He looked like a weight had just been lifted from his shoulders, like he got us this far, like his job was done. I didn't understand it then. I do now.

I only saw the scratch when he got up. Right above the belt, hip to hip. 

His shirt had always been tucked. 

My mother took a deep breath.

“Mom?” I whimpered. “Mom, no, no, no, please…”

She looked back at me and grasped my hand. She was cold to the touch. Mark whimpered something small. I knew then that he knew all along. 

“It happened the first night,” he whispered. “They can’t fight it anymore, Matty, it won’t let them.”

The car door opened. 

“Mom, you can’t go out there,”

She pulled her hand away. 

“Mom, please.”

“It’s okay honey,” she murmured dreamily. “Okay honey? Okay honey.”

She got out of the car and sprinted after my father. I never saw my mother sprint before. She looked so strange doing it. I watched the two of them go towards the store. Hand in hand. In a moment they were there and the next they were gone. 

“We have to follow them,” I begged. "Please."

A soft boom sounded from somewhere inside. 

“Okay,” he whispered hesitantly, “But be ready to run when I say run, deal?”

A second boom followed. 

“Deal,” I muttered.

“I am the oldest,” he insisted. “We don’t know what we’re going to see inside there. You have to listen to me.” 

“Shut up and let’s go.”

We hopped out of the car and ran across the empty lot. Rain and heavy wind swooped in with our arrival. Mark slipped and fell into a particularly nasty pool of blood. I raced back to help him. By the time we both made it inside…. our parents were gone. 

We looked around for a minute. The store seemed to be shelled. Overturned shelves made it difficult to get around. Smeared floors made the entire place stink worse than a slaughterhouse. 
At the center of the store was a staircase that leads to the basement level. Normally larger items like water jugs are stored down there. We got the distinct feeling that we weren’t totally alone, because we could hear some kind of movement in that area, so we moved towards it. Mark found some cover behind a blown out register. We used it to peek down the staircase.

An enormous pit sat below us.

We couldn’t actually see where it ended. Mark picked up a can and dropped it. Ten to fifteen seconds later it made contact with the bottom. The closer we inched towards the center, the more that movement seemed rhythmic, almost pulsing, like a heartbeat. 

We heard footsteps. 

Mark ripped my collar and pulled me back. Approaching the center of the store were a man and woman who both looked familiar to me from different places. That was my first thought, you know, that they must be together without me realizing, and that it really is a small city after all. 

The couple walked up casually to the edge of the pit. They looked at each other and smiled. Then they jumped, hand in hand, as if expecting to land in a ball pit. 

The splat came after the boom. 

The store grew quiet.

Something seemed to be slurping down below. 

“What the fuck,” Mark whispered. “You don’t think…?”

“It drinks the blood.”

Suddenly the pulsing grew louder. Horrible scraping ripped somewhere below it. I can’t adequately describe this sound - almost like a giant moth breaking its way out of a cocoon. A familiar rhythm to the din took over. 

*Rat-tap-tap.*

“Rat-tap-tap.*

“Checking for weaknesses,” Mark muttered. “Even at birth.”

**RAT-TAP-TAP.**”

**RATTAPTAPRATTAPRATTAPTAPTAP.**

“Time to go,” Mark shouted.

“Definitely,” I answered.

Each of us put in our best track performances to date. The building gave way as if an earthquake were underneath it. We skidded out of the front entrance just as the overhang dipped down to smash the carousel door. 

My brother got to the car before me. He jumped into the driver’s seat, and thank God, the keys were still in the ignition. He smashed the gas and all but left me with the passenger door popped open. I hopped in at the last possible moment. 

The store collapsed behind me. 

Mark doesn’t know shit about driving, and neither do I, but any idiot can hit the gas and steer away from the explosion. We picked up speed while debris rocked the car. Just as we got back on the road, Mark pointed into the rear view, and I wish he didn’t. 

Standing in the wake of the grocery store was a creature three times its size.

I didn’t look at it twice. 

“

We managed to drive to the gas station before nightfall. We found it pretty much untouched. I don’t think anybody else made it that far. 

We took the mountain road into the next town and drove past sundown.

We are safe and sound now in a place called White Valley. The people here are friendly, but none of them, including the sheriff, can tell me a damn thing about Follaton or what happened to it the past few days.

Go figure. 

I hope more than anything that my posts can help drive more survivors out of the woodwork. Please, please message me if you or someone you know lived through the attack on Follaton City. I can’t over-stress the importance of that plea. We cannot let our town be forgotten.

One day we will go back. I don’t care if it's just Mark and me. I know we can find the entrance the same way we found the exit. We don’t expect to find anybody alive. That’s just hope that’s not worth having. But we all have a right to know what is living there instead. 

Signing off for now,
