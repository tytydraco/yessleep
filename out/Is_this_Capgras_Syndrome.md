My friend has recently passed away due to her taking her own life. We believe that she had Capgras Syndrome a rare condition however, she was never formally diagnosed since she would isolate herself and refused to see doctors. I wanted to post this, not to expose her privacy but to see if anyone had more information about this syndrome or her case.    
“Capgras syndrome (CS), or delusion of doubles, is a delusional misidentification syndrome.\[1\] It is a syndrome characterized by a false belief that an identical duplicate has replaced someone significant to the patient. In CS, the imposter can also replace an inanimate object or an animal.\[1\] Contrary to the earlier belief that CS mainly affects women, it occurs in both genders.\[2\] It is widely regarded as the most prevalent of the delusional misidentification syndromes and appears in psychiatric and non-psychiatric cases, including patients with brain damage”

Hello,  
I recently got into a minor car crash where I hit the right side of my head, nothing serious. However, ever since, everything and everyone has been off to me, I believe that everything has been replaced by an exact look-a-like, an imposter. I’ve tried talking about it with my family, my friends, and my therapist, they all dismiss me. I’ve tried doing my own research, and nothing seems to match my symptoms. I don’t know who else to go to; I wish someone could help me.   
The day after I woke up from the crash everything looked exactly the same but just slightly off. Things weren’t the way that they were the previous day, things weren’t how they used to be. I thought this was just my morning brain fog getting in the way but as I looked in the mirror, I didn’t see myself looking back.   
Well, it looked like me, but it wasn’t. Its eyes were too close together, its teeth slightly too straight, its skin too tight or too loose on its body. There wasn’t another person with me though, it was me. My eyes grew in shock a bit and I stumbled back from the mirror. This person isn’t me. I’ve been replaced.   
I gathered my thoughts and tried to think rationally about everything. This must just be from hitting my head yesterday, it will go away.   
A week has passed and everything and everyone was still a fake. Why are they doing this to me? No, they are not doing anything; it’s me I hit my head, everything is going to be ok. It will pass.   
I look into the eyes of my mother, it’s her birthday and I can’t even show her any love, she is not my mother. Why? Did I do something wrong? Why did everyone leave me? I wish everyone would come back, I want to see my mom again.   
 My fingernails are nothing but keratin deposits on my digits my inner anatomy is being replaced too, nothing about me is real. Nothing about this world is real. I want to go back. No one listens to me; they say I am delusional, but I'm not they won’t believe me because they're fake too.   
Today I’m going to fix everything. I’m going to get my body back, and then everyone will come back, too; the imposters will flee from the mirror world I’m in. I will be able to go back. I am going to remove and replace each one of my organs, starting with my skin. I plan to replace it with all the imposters. It is going to work I know it will.   
I killed one of them today.  A little “girl”. They are not human so it doesn’t matter. I don’t feel bad. It’s not my fault that they decided to take me here. It is just paying the price.    
My plan is working, I have made a superficial cut along my upper torso. I have peeled back my skin and start ripping it out. Its not my skin anyway it doesn’t matter. I begin to take the creatures skin and sew to replace it. My plan is going to work, I can’t wait to see everyone again.   
I think that the creature is trying to poison me. Its skin has turned a greyish purple and it smells too. Its ok I need to replace more than just my skin for it to work after all. I’m going to replace my liver today it is going to let me see my friends again.
