A wave of shock shot through me. It was our knock. I didn’t dare respond. If that isn’t her… That means whoever it is has been listening to us. Now they’re reaching out to me. They know I can hear them... But what if it’s just her? She came back and was trying to see if I’m still awake. The thoughts whirled around like a hurricane. I couldn’t bear it. I couldn’t bear the silence. I couldn’t bear the uncertainty. It was all too much.

 

I got up, I grabbed my keys, and I left. As I walked out into the hallway, I saw her door. It looked the same as it always has; but to me, right now, it was a portal to hell. Someone… or something… was on the other side of that door. It might be pressed up against it. It might be looking out the peephole at me. I darted away. I simply couldn’t be here anymore.

 

I got outside and suddenly I could breathe again. The noise of the bustling city greeted me like an old friend. I never thought I would find such comfort in it. I sat down on a bench in front of my building. I wasn’t going to go back. Not while the sun was down.

 

I knew where my window was, so I knew where 402’s window was. I didn’t want to look at it but I had to… It was completely black. I couldn’t see anything inside. That was good, I thought. But that didn’t stop me from feeling like I was being watched. I felt eyes up there looming over me. I couldn’t rationalize it, but something inside was telling me that whatever was in 402 wasn’t a person. I fought against that thought for a long time, but I was starting to accept it.

 

I tried my best to ignore it all. It wasn’t easy. Eventually I laid down on the hard wooden slats and was able to some much-needed shut eye. I slept better than the last few nights.

 

I called in sick to work the next morning. I wanted to be here when Jane got home… Or to see if she was already home and last night was a massive overreaction.

 

I felt safer seeing the sunlight beaming through my windows when I got back inside. I tried to occupy myself by catching up on some household chores, as the back of my mind waited anxiously for the next sound.

 

I heard nothing all day. The longer it went on, the more sure I became that Jane wasn’t home. As the sun set, it was apparent that she decided to stay with her sister for another night. Meaning that yesterday night… definitely wasn’t her. Also meaning that I was here alone for another night.

 

I tried calling again… I don’t know why I expected the outcome to be different. Still wasn’t in service. I made extra sure I got the number right. It was exactly the number she said. Why would she give me the wrong number? Was it a new phone and she got it wrong by accident? Or did what I said to her really freak her out and… Maybe she thinks I’m not to be trusted. She placated me with a false number and then got the hell away from me. That outcome would’ve hurt the most. But a third idea crept into my mind too… The idea that maybe SHE couldn’t be trusted. I vehemently resisted that idea.

 

Night fell and the dread came with it. Part of me wanted to go outside to the bench again, but another part of me had to hear it one more time first. One more time to confirm that it was still in there, and then I could call the cops, because this needed to end.

 

I don’t know why the noises always seemed to start at 2:00, but that’s what I was waiting for. As 1:59 turned over, my senses sharpened. I waited, and I waited, expecting that sit-up sound. Only it didn’t come.

 

I had hoped that not hearing it would put my mind at ease… But that was not the case. It only put me more on edge. I felt like I was being watched. I felt like the thing on the other side knew I was listening.

 

I couldn’t hear anything… But I could feel the presence. It was there. I knew it. I just needed confirmation. The longer the silence went on, the more doubt began to creep in. The doubt infuriated me. All of this was doubt. Every second of this nightmare was doubt, and possibility, and “maybe.” I knew nothing. Nothing made sense. I was afraid, and I was frustrated. So… I made a decision.

 

I stood facing the wall, carefully picking up my phone in one hand and my keys in the other. Ready to run and dial 911 at a moment’s notice. I gathered up all the courage I had, and prepared to speak. I had to call out to it. I had to know that I wasn’t crazy. I opened my mouth, but before the words could escape…

 

“Leigh.” A soft voice whispered through the wall… It was… Jane. She sounded further away and her voice had a slight echo to it but… It was unmistakably her voice.

 

“Jane?” The word fell out. My voice cracked.

 

“Help me.” She sounded afraid. Hushed. Like she didn’t want to wake something.

 

“Jane, what’s going on?” I had a million questions, I was frantic, but I quieted my voice to match her’s. Suddenly I was afraid to wake it up too.

 

“Please help me, Leigh.”

 

“How are you there? When did you get back?” I whispered, not covering my desperation.

 

“I see it.” She continued. A shiver went down my spine.

 

“I’m going to call the cops right now. They’ll be right there.” It was the only solution I had.

 

“I don’t want to die.”

 

She fell silent after that, but I heard the breathing against the wall again. The hair on my arms stood on end. I was too scared to think straight, but I knew this wasn’t right… It was her voice but… It can’t have been her.

 

Knock Knock.

 

Knock Knock.

 

Knock Knock.

 

I had enough. I ran out into the hallway and dialed 911. I told them there was an intruder. I kept it vague because vague is all I had. As I spoke, I kept my eyes on her door. I wouldn’t let it out of my sight. If it left, I would see it. If it stayed, they would catch it… I hoped. They advised me to stay in my apartment and lock the door. I didn’t listen.

 

It took around 40 minutes for them to arrive. Two officers arrived on my floor and the building manager was with them with keys to let them into her unit. I think his name was Larry. Like I said, I forgot a lot of names and faces. He shot me a brief glare when he saw me standing there. I probably woke him up with all this.

 

I wanted to get a glimpse into the room but I was ushered away, back into my unit. My stomach was in knots with stress, I just wanted this to be over. I didn’t know what to expect. Would there be shouting? Would I hear a fight? Would there be gunshots? A part of me had a feeling… A dreadful feeling… That they would get in there and they wouldn’t find anything.

 

Minutes passed. I waited and waited, but I couldn’t hear anything from the wall. Not a peep. “Why aren’t they going inside?” I thought out loud. Suddenly there was a knock at my door. I opened the door and sure enough it was the officers, flanked by Larry.

 

They told me what I was afraid of, “We searched the apartment, and we couldn’t find any signs of someone living in there.”

 

“You WENT inside?” I questioned. I knew they didn’t go inside.

 

“We searched the entire unit, up and down. There was no one in there. But if you hear anything again-“ After that point I tuned out. I exchanged the default pleasantries and they went on their way. I couldn’t find a shit to give in any of their words, and I was too frustrated and exhausted to search for it.

 

I tried to get answers. Instead, I ended up with yet another question atop the pile. Why wouldn’t they go inside? What did Larry tell them?

 

I knew I wasn’t getting any sleep that night. All I could do was sit on the bed and overthink. This was all bigger than I thought it was. Jane could have been in on it. Larry could have been in on it. The police could have been in on it for all I knew... I really didn’t want to believe that Jane was in on it…

 

The way Larry glared at me… Maybe it wasn’t “screw you for waking me up in the middle of the night.” Maybe I stirred something up that I wasn’t supposed to. Maybe the problem wasn’t with Jane. Maybe there wasn’t an intruder, a creature, or even a ghost. Maybe it was the room itself.

 

As I sat and drove myself crazy with these theories, a new sound shot into my ear and sent my heart up into my throat. Some kind of rapid clacking sound. Almost sounded like someone button mashing a controller, but not as plastic-y. I jumped off the bed, and the sound stopped. The room wasn’t done with me yet.

 

I had never heard this sound before. I couldn’t place it at first, but once the initial shock wore off I knew exactly what it sounded like. It sounded like teeth chattering. I didn’t want to believe that’s what it was. There are lots of things that sound similar to teeth chattering. If it was any other circumstance, I could easily debunk it as the place settling. Little rhythmic cracking of hard materials rubbing together, bending. But this isn’t any other circumstance.

 

I was frozen in fear once again. The images my mind involuntarily conjured up were instantly traumatizing. A wide, chattering, horse-like, bloody mouth upon a gaunt, sunken face. A naked man with hungry mouths strewn all over his body. A zipper made of teeth going all the way down a human head so it can open like a venus fly trap. Those chattering mouth toys you get from a joke store haphazardly sewn into human flesh.

 

I pleaded for my imagination to stop but it simply wouldn’t. The mouth abominations. The veiled woman. The ghoulish watcher pressed against the wall. All my imagination, but imagination is powerful when reality is vague. One of them could be real, if this thing even has a form. Maybe it was just a shadow in the dark.

 

The sounds began again, now I heard scratching at the wall. Not hard. Not ferocious. Little light scrapes, nearly inaudible. Like it was just kind of… picking at it, or scribbling against it. It sounded like having a rat in the walls. I used to be afraid of rats, I thought. Now I would love nothing more than for this to only be a rat.

 

The sound began to change. Those little scrapes and scribbles along the wall morphed somehow. I couldn’t tell if it was just my tired mind changing them the way that my tired eyes could make the stucco ceilings move and warble, but the sound changed nevertheless. The scribbles began to sound breath-y. They started sounding more like whispers than scribbles. The content of the whispers was indiscernible. My mind went to someone in a small padded room, sitting in a corner with their legs curled up to their chest, shaking and whispering incoherent gibberish to themselves.

 

There was an almost hypnotic effect to the whispers. I resisted the urge to move closer to try and make out any words hidden in the almost silent muttering. I wouldn’t have the opportunity to try, however, because suddenly a blood-curdling scream exploded through the wall. I almost leapt out of my skin. It wasn’t just any scream; it was Jane’s voice again. I had never heard a scream so horrific in my life, but it was enough to break me from the trance I was falling into. I grabbed my keys and ran outside as fast as I could.

 

I spent another night on the bench outside. At least whatever was left of the night by this point. Even outside and far away from the room, sleep wouldn’t come. The images I conjured were too horrific, and the sounds replayed over and over. The deep, frustrating, impossible uncertainty of the situation loomed over me heavily – as did the eyes that I still felt watching me from the window. I was terrified, and I felt truly alone.

 

Morning came and I felt the relative safety of the sun. It took a while for me to gain the courage to re-enter my apartment, but I did. Then I went to work like always. Despite all this, despite being scared out of my mind, sleep deprived, and feeling like I’m going insane; Life doesn’t care. The world keeps turning. I still gotta eat. If this monotonous routine wasn’t already so deeply ingrained into me, I might have had a full psychotic break by now, but my body was on autopilot. Plus, I didn’t like being home anymore. Even in the day time. Last night was too much.

 

I didn’t go home right away after work. I delayed as much as I could. I thought about staying somewhere else, but if Jane was back – and if she really was the friend I thought she was – I had to be there to warn her about the thing that uses her voice. There was also one more thing that compelled me to come back. A breadcrumb I had to follow.

 

I got into my building, but instead of heading up to the fourth floor I went straight into the front office... I hated this little room. Unkempt. Smelly. With a thick hum of fluorescent light tubes. Luckily, he was still there. Head down in some papers. I knew he had to have some kind of answers for me. He had to know something.

 

“Larry, you got a minute?” I asked, trying my best to put some extra bass into my voice.

 

“It’s Mike.”

 

“Fuck.”

 

“Don’t worry about it.” He replied with a slight chuckle, then looked up to meet my gaze. When he saw me, his expression slightly changed.

 

“Ah. Um, Have a seat.” He seemed to be expecting this visit. He knew something. I could see it in him.

 

I took the only seat without papers and envelopes all over it.

 

“What can I do for you?” He asked.

 

I had so many questions, but I wanted to choose the simplest and most broad one to start, just to see where he takes it. Only four words popped into my head right away.

 

“What’s wrong with 402?”

 

Mike gave me a half hearted grin. He knew this was coming. “Look, kid, maybe it would do you good to just get out of there for a while, okay? Stay with a relative or something.”

 

“What are you talking about?” I responded, bewildered.

 

“You know, city life, it’s not for everyone. It drives us all a little crazy sometimes. I know I love to go camping every now and again with the old lady. Once or twice a summer, get away from all this. It just gets your mind right.”

 

I saw through his words, and I knew that he could read on my face that I wasn’t accepting them. “Tell me what’s wrong with 402.”

 

Mike sat back in his chair and let out a deep sigh.

 

“I don’t know.” He said that like it was an answer. But he continued before I could press him. “I wish I knew. It’s just one of those things.”

 

“It’s just one of those things?” I repeated, immediately put off by his tone.

 

“Okay… I don’t really like to talk about it. I try not to. I find that’s best…” he paused, took a few seconds to find the words, then continued. “People don’t do well in 402. Meaning they get scared and they leave or… You know, whatever. I don’t know what it is, and I’m not a superstitious type. There’s just something wrong with it. That’s all I can say.” He explained. His body language changed, I saw him begin to fidget with his hands.

 

“Did anything happen in that room?” I questioned.

 

He took another big sigh. “A lot of calls to the police, like yesterday, thinking there’s an intruder. A man in the closet. A man under the bed. Things like that. Spookhouse things. That’s how it started. It all sounded like nonsense. Of course, police find nothing every time. We get the place tested for a gas leak or what have you. Nada. So we carry on. What more can I do, right?”

 

A shockwave shot through me as he said all this. I was stunned. This was the first kind of confirmation I had gotten about any of this. It’s all real. All of it. It’s not just me.

 

He continued, “Then things start getting worse. People started doing things to themselves. You know what I mean? They started… carving themselves up. Paramedics would be in and out. It was getting really bad. Sarah, my wife, she cleans the rooms up for new tenants. They were in and out of 402 all the time, so she was in there a lot. One day she tells me she can’t go in there anymore. I ask why, she says because something is watching her. She says it ‘knows her’. She says something terrible is going to happen in there. I don’t know what to make of that. But she never went into 402 again. She doesn’t even like going near the door because she thinks there’s someone at the peephole. Then… There was the disappearance... That girl went missing. You heard about that, right?”

 

I was ashamed to admit that I didn’t. Maybe it came up… Maybe at one point I was told… But it was long since forgotten.

 

“They presumed her dead. Never found her. I knew… I knew it had something to do with the room, so I closed it for good. Nobody in or out unless absolutely necessary.”

 

I didn’t know what to say. I was horrified. What must all of these people have seen? I shuddered to think. But also… I still had questions. This sounded right, but there were glaring inconsistencies. I had to keep prodding.

 

“How did you get the police to go along with that?” I asked first, attempting to remain composed.

 

“I didn’t… They do their business, they’re in and out quick. They never find anything, and they don’t really ask. It’s the city.”

 

“No but… They didn’t go inside the room last night. Why didn’t they go in?”

 

Mike shot me a confused look. “They DID go in. They went in, they searched, they found nothing like they always do. New guys, its been a few years, but none of them do.”

 

I was getting frustrated again. Things weren’t lining up.

 

“Why are you lying? Why lie about this? I know they didn’t go in. I would have heard them if they went in, I hear EVERYTHING that happens in there. And you clearly didn’t close the room because you rented it out. It’s occupied, right now. And Jane said you told her about previous tenants when she moved in, so there were people even before her.”

 

Mike’s expression completely dropped. “You think someone lives there right now?”

 

“Yes. Someone lives there. Don’t lie to me.” I asserted.

 

“No one has lived there for eight years. I promise you.” He said coldly.

 

I was boiling over. I lost my composure entirely. “Someone lives there! Jane lives there! We both know damn well she does. I’ve spoken to her almost every day since she moved in. I’ve heard her cook, I’ve heard her clean, I’ve heard her shitty music. She’s my friend, and she’s in danger living in this fucking room and you just let her go on in for what? Your bottom line? You really needed that extra rent money? What, for your camping trips?”

 

Mike raised his voice to match mine, “Listen buddy, I don’t know what to tell you. Nobody lives in that fucking room. I won’t allow it. You wanna go see for yourself? Here-” Mike rummaged around his desk and threw a set of keys at me. “You have at it. Go have a look. It’s an empty fucking room. And after you see that it’s an empty room, do the smart thing – don’t stick around. Don’t go inside. Lock it back up, then pack your shit and get out because your room isn’t safe anymore.”

 

I was stunned. I was angry. I was confused, and slightly ashamed. I had no more to say, so I turned to leave, but then he spoke up one more time.

 

“Oh and by the way, you really are shit with names because ‘Jane’? That’s the name of the girl who went missing. Jane Lewis.”

 

My whole body went numb as I walked out. This couldn’t be the truth. I couldn’t have been talking to a dead person this whole time. I had guessed that this thing was using her voice somehow, but that was only at night. It can’t have all been fake. Jane was my friend. I couldn’t believe it. I refused to believe it. That walk up to my floor was the longest of my life.

 

I approached 402 with the key in my hand, but stopped in front of the door. I stood for what felt like hours. I just… couldn’t bring myself to do it. Not right now. The thought of opening that door even for a moment, especially at night, was far too horrifying. I had to sit down and collect myself. I went inside my apartment and immediately sat on my bed. I wanted to cry. This was all too much. But all I could do was sit and shiver in silence until-

 

Knock Knock.
