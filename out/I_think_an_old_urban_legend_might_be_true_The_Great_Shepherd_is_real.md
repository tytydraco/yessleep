My story spans back many years, more than I'd care to admit. It started back when I was a young, impressionable boy, who was afraid of pretty much everything. I think most people knew that I was easily spooked, and they must've found joy in provoking fear within me. 

Classmates would hide around corners and jump out at me, which always resulted in a loud scream followed by even louder laughter. Even on one or two occasions, they would dress up as some sort of monster or ghoul and chase me around the schoolyard. Their favourite way to scare me however, was by telling me scary stories.

Of course, many of the stories that they told would undoubtedly keep me awake at night, and plagued my mind and filled me with anxiety. Though now I couldn't recount any of those stories to you as they have become just another forgotten memory of a time long ago. However, there is one exception.

One of my cruel classmates' stories has continued to be permanently stuck inside of my head for all of these years. The story has both haunted and perplexed me since my ears first heard it. The story I am referring to is that of 'The Great Shepherd'.

The story of The Great Shepherd is as follows:


Long ago, before your parents, or even your grandparents were born, there was a reclusive farmer that lived on a run down farm. The farm had not seen any rainfall for many months and the crops were beginning to wither and die, and the animals were doing the same.

 No one knows exactly how long the farmer had lived or worked on this farm, but everyone knew that he kept to himself and never came into contact with any other living human. 

The only living souls that this farmer did actually interact with was his large flock of sheep that he kept on the farm. But, due to the lack of water that fell from the sky, his water supply was diminishing and so his flock were slowly dying. 

The talk in the closest  town to the farm was that his flock were more akin to family, then they were to livestock. This meant that the farmer was watching his 'family' slowly die. 

The townspeople, when walking by the farm, would report the ever-declining number of sheep. The ones that were still surviving were growing thinner each day. The farmer could no longer keep the flock alive. His water supply was too low. Yet, the farmer still tried his best to preserve his flock. 

The sight of the malnourished and dehydrated sheep must have upset the locals, and one of them decided that the sheep didn't deserve to live in that condition. It is unknown who exactly, but one of the townspeople poisoned what little was left of the farmer's water that the sheep would drink. 

Over the next couple of days, the flock started to shrink even quicker than before. Before long, only one sheep remained, and even this animal had already ingested the toxin.

It is said that the final sheep died only three days after the water had been poisoned. At precisely 10:16 at night, the animal passed on whilst in the farmer's arms.

The day after the entirety of his flock had perished, the farmer was seen wandering aimlessly through the nearby town. He was stumbling, with no clear sense as to where he was going. Wherever he went, he muttered the same singular phrase to himself over and over again.

"*The Great Shepherd will save the righteous and punish the wicked….The Great Shepherd will save the righteous and punish the wicked"*.

Of course, the townspeople passed this off as ramblings of a man gone mad with grief, and so tried their best to steer him back towards the farm he called home. They did manage to get the farmer to exit the town and venture back towards his dwelling, and they thought that would be that. But, they were wrong.

That night, one of the locals was killed at precisely 10:16. He was discovered the next day with a penny-sized hole tunnelled through his neck. It was unsure who or what caused this bizarre death.

 But then, the following night another person was killed with a hole bored through their neck. They also were killed at exactly 10:16. The same time as the previous victim, and the time that the farmer's final sheep died. 

This continued for many more weeks. Each night, someone new was found dead with a hole burrowed through their neck. Each time, killed at 10:16. Soon, everyone in town was either dead, or they had fled the town in fear that they were next. 

It is now said the farmer, who is now known as 'The Great Shepherd', is still out there. Looking for more souls to join his flock. Every night, at precisely 10:16, another poor soul is killed by something being forced through their neck. 

Their soul then joins the rest of them, in one big flock. So, every night at 10:16 you need to be careful. If you have been wicked, The Great Shepherd may come for you, and you will be his next soul. 


Now, I know what you are thinking. That this story is just the average story that is made up to scare young children, and that it has no real basis in reality. As a child though, it did really creep me out, as I was told that the farm was located close to where I lived.

 I spent the next couple years scared to sleep. I would find myself watching the clock, just waiting for it to tick over to 10:17. That's when I knew I was safe and had successfully survived another night. 

I did genuinely believe that The Great Shepherd would hunt each night and kill a new victim at the exact same time every 24 hours. I had a ritual of staring at the clock from 10pm until 10:17pm every night, my heart racing and my level of fear steadily growing.

 I could only relax once the clock moved past that fateful minute and I knew I wasn't The Great Shepherd's victim for that day. 

Of course, this only lasted a year or two and then, like my childhood clothes, I also grew out of my childhood fear. I stopped watching the clock and I could rest easy, even if it was still before 10:16.

 It wasn't until I was a few years older that I noticed these two numbers beginning to make an appearance in other areas of my life. 

Over the span of the following two decades, I would often see these numbers pop up, which would remind me of the story from my younger years. I would then promptly forget about it again and move on with my life. But, the constant reminders of the story meant that the tale was never fully removed from my mind. 

I would constantly notice that clocks in movies and television shows would be set to 10:16, and often when I would check on my own clock at random, that would be the exact time.

 I remember that even on one occasion that I received a catalogue from a jewelry store that had a whole page that advertised watches. Of course, each and every watchface had the hour hand pointed to the 10, and the minute hand lined up with the 16. 

It was the little reminders like this that meant I could never be completely free from the fear of that precise time. It would always cast my mind back to the story of The Great Shepherd.

There was one event, quite recently, that conjured up this memory once more, and this time it made me realise that there may be more to the story. The event in question occurred whilst driving through a quiet back road on a dark night.

I was driving along one of those roads that has nothing down it for long stretches of time, then suddenly a solitary building appears and it seems as if it is lost. The back road was quiet, with only my vehicle to embrace it's tarmac. 

The only light visible was the white glow emanating from my headlights. It had been a while since I passed anything that even slightly resembled civilization, when I saw the silhouette of a building further down the road. 

I drove towards the building and as I approached, I saw a light flickering close to the road. I slowed the vehicle down slightly, so that I could get a better look as to what the light source was. As I got closer, I figured out that it was from a large billboard, and the building behind it was a church. 

The large billboard that belonged to the church was constantly flickering, and each time the light flicked on, it revealed a set of thick black letters. The light stayed on just long enough for me to read what was written on the sign. It read, 'Proverbs 10:16'.

As soon as I saw what was displayed on the sign, the story of The Great Shepherd rushed back into my brain. I was still alone on a dark and quiet road, and so I actually felt myself become scared of the story for the first time in many years. I pushed my foot further into the accelerator, and rushed out of the area. 

When I arrived home, thoughts of a soul stealing shepherd still plagued my thoughts, and my curiosity grew. I needed to know what Proverbs 10:16 said. I doubted that it would be related in any way to the old story, but I still had to know. 

I dug around the house for a while, rummaging through drawers and a bookcase, trying to find a copy of The Bible. I managed to find one that was hidden inside a drawer in the kitchen. It was slightly dusty and the cover had seen better days, but it would still do the trick.

 I opened it up and flicked through, trying to find the book, verse and chapter that was exhibited on the church's billboard. I quickly found it and read what was written. 

**Proverbs 10:16**
'The wages of the righteous is life, but the earnings of the wicked are sin and death'.

At first, I couldn't determine any relation to the story and the Bible verse that I had just read. Then, two of the words within the text stood out to me. Righteous. Wicked. The two words that I realised were in both the Bible and the story of The Great Shepherd. 

The Great Shepherd was heard muttering that he would save the righteous and would punish the wicked. He was doing almost exactly what this Bible first was saying. Being righteous would lead to life or being "saved", and being wicked would lead to death. Surely, this was more than just a coincidence. 

I pondered it for a moment, and decided that I would continue to look through the good book, to see if there was anything else that related to the old scary tale. I found two more examples. 

**Matthew 10:16**
"I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves".

**John 10:16**
"I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd".

Another two bible verses that related to sheep and flock. And another appearance from those two very familiar numbers. I was starting to come to the conclusion that there was something more to the story and to these numbers. 

I placed the Bible back down and sat in silence for a moment. My heart rate was steadily increasing and I felt a sense of dread that I hadn't felt since my younger years.

 I then decided that I needed to find out if this farm was actually real or not. To do that, I would need to come into contact with some historic documents. 

The local library is where I headed, just in case it was true that the farm was nearby. I spoke to the librarian, a little old lady that looked as if she may have been alive when the story was set. She claimed that she didn't know anything about it, but she pointed me in the right direction of old property deeds. 

I spent the next few hours sorting through these documents, searching for anything that resembled the old farmhouse. I actually managed to find it. The property deed was a photocopy of the original, but even the copy looked old and dated. 

Paperclipped to the deed was an old newspaper article that contained details about the farm and how the livestock was slowly dying due to lack of water. Due to this article, I knew I had the right property. 

I quickly came to the realisation that the old farm was only an hour or so drive from where I lived, so it was close. The address of the farm was 10 Sedici Lane. So, that's where I headed. 

I drove out to the old farmhouse that I was surprised to see was still standing. The old bricks and stone were crumbling and any paint that was once there, was now long gone.

 The old wire fence that ran around the farm's perimeter was beginning to sag, and now only hung just above the ground. I easily jumped over the fence and made my way towards the farmhouse. As I got closer, I saw that the wooden front door was rotting and falling away, which provided me with a small gap to climb into. 

I climbed into the house and stepped into a large open area that was filled with dust and stone that had fallen from the ceiling. I walked over the ground, my footsteps crunching with each step. I walked out into another room, this time it was dimly lit as not much natural light seeped through the roof. 

I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight. It immediately lit up the back wall of the room, and I saw that there was writing on the wall. It was scribbled onto the wall in what appeared to be blood. 

'A flock is nothing without a Shepherd. The Shepherd is not Great without his flock'. 

It was messily scrawled onto the wall. It looked as though it was written with fingertips rather than a paintbrush. As I read it, I felt the hairs on my neck stand up, as if they were alert and searching for danger. 

My eyes were then drawn to the side of the walls, towards a wooden stick that was propped up against it. The stick was upside down and, due to the smooth curve resting against the floor, I recognised it as a staff that is commonly associated with shepherds. 

The long, straight portion of the stick stood upright, and I immediately saw that it was sharpened to a point. At the tip of the point was dried blood.

That was a week ago now. The story of The Great Shepherd has been etched into my brain ever since my discovery. I am now afraid to sleep again, not until the clock has ticked over to 10:17.


 I don't know exactly what any of this means, but I am afraid that there may be some truth to the scary story. I didn't know what else to do but to warn others of what could be out there. I am now living in fear, which I don't wish upon any of you reading this, but I want you to be warned. Warned that, at 10:16, The Great Shepherd may come hunting for another soul to join his flock.
