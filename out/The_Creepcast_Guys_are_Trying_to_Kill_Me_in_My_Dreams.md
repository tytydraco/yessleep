Every night I have a dream where the hosts of Creepcast try to kill me. For those who don’t know, Creepcast is a popular horror podcast where the hosts read creepypasta. 

As of writing it’s number 40 on the US Spotify charts. 

The hosts are Hunter and Isaiah. Isaiah’s YouTube name is Wendigoon. Based on the creature from Native American folklore. He chose the name shortly before “goon” took on its modern meaning of chronic masturbation.

He’s a Christian and loves guns. He came to fame with his “iceberg” videos, delving deep into topics like conspiracy theories and serial killers. 

Hunter goes by the name Meat Canyon or Papa Meat. He gained fame with his animated shorts. Riffing on famous IPs, often with a body horror aesthetic.He’s obsessed with horror movies and has an unhinged, wild man persona. 

For the show Isaiah reads the prose with reverence while Hunter does the character voices, using the skills that made him famous. Together they’re a perfect double act. Hunter loud and crazy, always going off on weird tangents, reigned in by Isaiah. 

For a solid year I watched them every Sunday. It was the perfect end to my week. Putting them on felt like having old friends over for tea. So it wasn’t surprising when I started dreaming about them. But it’s what happens in the dreams that’s the problem. 

I’m a writer myself and have often dreamed of being featured on the show. In one dream, one of my stories, "I'm a Tour Guide in a Place that Shouldn't Exist", is picked for Creepcast. It's the best day of my life. I share the episode with every single one of my friends.

It couldn't get any better but it does. The guys start development on a Creepcast movie, an anthology of their favourite stories and they decide to include mine. I'm flown to the States along with other writers from all over the world.

Overjoyed, I hop on the plane without hesitation. It seems like everything I have hoped for is coming true. On the 14 hour flight I listen to old episodes, wishing I could fast forward through time.

For the first night, I stay at Isaiah's house because they can't find me a hotel. His wife makes chicken and we stay up late talking horror stories. Ironically, I feel like pinching myself to see if I'm awake.

That night I can't sleep, being thousands of miles from home and wired with excitement. I go downstairs for a glass of water. I sit at the kitchen table, taking in the unfamiliar sounds of the Appalachian countryside. 

Isaiah, also unable to sleep, gets up and hears me in the kitchen. Half-asleep, he has forgotten that I'm staying there. Taking me for an intruder he takes his Desert Eagle and shoots me as I turn to greet him. It feels incredibly real. The bullet tearing through my chest, the chair toppling over with me in it. My blood leaking out on the indifferent tile floor.

Isaiah is right beside me, on the phone with the ambulance. He holds a dish towel against the hole in my chest. The bullet wound is so deep that part of the towel enters my chest cavity.

With my fading vision I see something in the darkness of the kitchen window. The white glint of horns reflecting the moonlight. The last thing I hear is Isaiah asking for forgiveness.

In another scenario I stay at Hunter's house in Kansas City. He asks me: “You want to watch a horror movie with me and the guys? Drink some tiny rums?” The whole gang is there. His wife Alison, his buddies Nick and Harry. “Of course!” I say, trying not to sound too desperately eager. What could be better?

The movie is extreme, even for a guy like me who enjoyed movies halfway down Isaiah's extreme movie iceberg. The plot is hard to follow. Just scene after scene of people being tortured. The torturers are members of some religion, worshiping an entity that feeds on pain. It's beyond my limit but I don't want Hunter to think I'm a pussy so I power through.

It's at the 45 minute mark; I'm watching a naked screaming man struggle to free himself from a rusty bear trap. I recognise him, it's one of the other writers. That's when I realise what I'm looking at isn't artifice, it's a snuff film.

They lured us here with the promise of fame. We're writers. Loners. No one would miss us. The others on the couch sense that I know. They all turn to look at me and laugh in a terrifying moment of paranoia become real.

I’m formulating excuses to leave when I start to feel groggy. I only took the mini rum bottles he handed me, stupid...I pass out.

The pain makes me come to. Hunter is ripping flesh from my body with a curved knife, to add to the real meat suit he's wearing. I feel the knife exploring my guttyworks. I try to scream but he’s cut through my vocal chords and all that comes out is a wet whistle. He chortles as he goes about his work.

In yet another dream the boys come to Ireland with a live show. In a dream come true moment I'm invited onstage with them to read the voice of one of the characters. I'm so happy to be chosen that I flub most of my lines. They interview me and I'm able to plug my story and they promise to read it on the show.

I'm invited backstage to an after party. The atmosphere is charged. We’re all psyched to hang out with our heroes. We’re asked do we want to go to a second location for a "surprise". We figure it must be some extra content for the Patreon. As any true crime fan will tell you, never go to a second location.

We're taken somewhere, blind-folded. When we take them off we see that Papa and Wendi are wearing black robes. They have other robed acolytes with them. Looking at the signs and machinery I realise the place is an old dog food factory. With giant meat grinders.

Papa grins as he takes a control pad and hits a button, the grinders stutter to life. We try to run but the acolytes are big guys and hold us down. When I look again I see they’re not guys, they’re powerfully built, Amazonian women. Seven of them.

I guess they were fans too. I could see the face of the one holding me under her hood. She looked at Isaiah like he was a saint. 

Wendi takes out a mockery of a bible bound in human skin. He reads passages in an impossibly old, pre-human tongue.

Papa laughs, "you think we got to number 40 on Spotify by talent alone?", before feeding the first fan into the mincer while the rest of us are forced to watch.

“It's a bit right? It's just a bit!” says a fan. She's a larger young lady with green hair and a long sleeved metal tee with that impossible to read writing. Tears and snot run down her face. She's shaking hard like she’s been dragged back and forth by invisible hands.

“I don't think so.”

It's my turn. I wish I woke up the second the blades cut into me, but I remain unconsciously conscious for every instant, as my body is shredded into chum.

I feel something watching from the shadows, something that approves of my suffering.

Hunter turns on the other machines and further down the line my soggy remains are sealed into a can.

There are subtle variations, sometimes Isaiah kills me, sometimes Hunter. Sometimes they do it together. The pattern is always the same. They begin as hopeful dreams, and end as horrible nightmares.

I need these dreams to end. They're too real. Some of the scenarios last days and I feel like I've lived them. The experience of dying over and over is a strain the human mind was never meant to bear.

6 months of this. I sleepwalk through my days, barely functioning. Dreading closing my eyes.

I don't know if the boys are somehow responsible. Could they be involved in the occult, gaining power from the worship of their fans? But I don't want to blame them. My parasocial love is too strong.

Maybe it's an entity that lives in dreams, hijacking the image of something I love to better torment me.

I just know I need it to stop.

I booked a ticket for Kansas. Studying their socials, it was easy to predict when they'd be doing a collab and be in the same place. I don't want to hurt them. I just want them to explain.

I know they'll understand. They're my friends.
