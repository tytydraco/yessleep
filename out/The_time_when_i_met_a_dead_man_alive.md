This happened three months ago, i still remember it thanks to the news. 

It was a Wednesday night, i had woken up because i needed to take a piss, but as i was finished, someone started knocking at the door. I washed my hands and went to the door, checking the peephole first.

There was a man standing there, he was so still, almost like a lifeless statue, but i couldn't see him very well because the porch light wasn't on. I knew that answering the door to a complete stranger, especially in the middle of the night, was a *very* bad idea, but i was too curious.

I turned on the light and opened the door slightly, with the chain on, of course. I looked through the gap and i can see him much clearly now; He looked chubby, he wore a black zipped-up flight jacket, ragged jeans, dirty trucker boots, and a black beanie on his head.

But that wasn't all, i couldn't tell if it was the shadows, but his skin looked bluish-grey. His eyes were baggy, as if he was really tired and needed better sleep.

"Hey man, i can-"

"Does Derek live here?" the man interrupted me before i ask, he said in a monotonous, yet serious sounding voice.

I gulped and waited for a second if he was going to interrupt me again, then i said "Derek? I dunno any guy named Derek, i think you got the wrong house"

The man just stood here, still motionless, before saying "Sorry dude, have a good night" as he turned and walked away. I closed the door, and as i did, i heard his footsteps that sounded squelchy, as if he was completely soaked in water.

In fact, i forgot to mentioned this but when i opened the door, there was a faint odour of salt lingering off this guy. Another thing i noticed was when i looked at his shoes, there was a rope tightly around his right ankle, it looked like it was snapped off of something heavy.

Days went by and i nearly forgot about him, i theorised that he was probably some homeless man looking for his friend or something, until i heard the news.

Long story short; A man named Derek Mart√≠nez, a co-leader of some cartel drug operation, was found murdered in a cheap motel, which served as his hideout from authorities. He had been strangled and stabbed with a kitchen knife multiple times, but it was clear that the strangling killed him first.

It was a personal killing, and to their surprise, no DNA evidence was found.

And this is where shit gets fucking crazier; The police also fished a body of a man, twenty-three miles from the local beach. He was identified as Samuel Austin, a drug dealer who worked for Derek and apparently, Derek was very abusive towards him. The abuse got to the point where Samuel snitched on Derek and the other members of the drug operation. Everyone was arrested, except for Derek as he managed to get away.

After the DEA got the operation shut down, Samuel was at a phonebooth, trying to get a lawyer until Derek knocked him out by slamming his head viciously against the dial pad, then stealing a boat where he tied a cement block to Samuel's right ankle and pushed him into the dark, cold, and unforgivable ocean.

I knew that guy looked familiar, we weren't friends but i remember walking my dog the other day and passing him. He first offered if i wanted any of his "stuff", which i declined, and he never got desperate for cash unlike most dealers. He was actually very understanding and even gave me a thumbs up for making the right choice. I'm glad he got his revenge.
