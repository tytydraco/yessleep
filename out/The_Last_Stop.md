I boarded the midnight bus at the deserted terminal, the yellow sign flickering overhead: Route 27 – Crescent Avenue. The driver was an old man with tired eyes and a cracked smile. He nodded once, silently, as I climbed the steps and settled into the last seat. The interior lights hummed, casting a jaundiced glow over empty rows. Outside, the rain hammered the asphalt like a drum.

I checked my watch: 12:02 AM. The next stop was three miles away, at an abandoned station they’d closed years ago after a fatal accident. I shivered at the memory—five commuters crushed under a runaway freight train. The station still appeared on maps, marked by that ghostly red symbol.

Rain streaked the windows and distorted the street lamps into smeared orbs of yellow. I pulled my coat tighter, listening to the squeak of tires on wet pavement. No other passengers boarded. No one disembarked. The bus whispered through the night, as if it knew secrets nobody else dared share.

At 12:15 AM, the driver flicked a switch, and the route indicator above the windshield changed: Station 13. The old man glanced at me through the mirror. His eyes held a glint—unease or warning, I couldn’t tell.

We rolled to a stop. Outside, Crescent Terminal stretched dark and empty. I rose to pay the fare, but the bus fell silent. The driver stared ahead, expression unreadable. I tapped the fare box, and it clinked hollowly. When I turned back, every seat was now occupied.

They sat motionless, faces hidden beneath drenched hoods and umbrellas. Their coats were soaked, but their hands rested on their laps, unmoving. I counted six of them. All stared straight ahead; none looked at me.

I swallowed and asked, “Do we stop at Station 13?”

The driver’s eyes flicked to me. “We do,” he said, voice low. “But only tonight.”

My heart thudded. I’d meant to get off earlier. I peered down the aisle. Each figure was eerily still, as though carved from marble. I remembered the accident: five victims. Yet here were six.

“Why six seats?” I whispered, turning back. The driver had already closed his eyes.

The bus lurched forward. At each intersection, the driver let out a deep sigh, as though burdened with every turned corner. The lights inside dipped with each turn of the wheel, then snapped back on. Rain pelted the windows.

At 12:27 AM, the sign switched to Station 13 – Last Stop. A chime rang. The driver opened his eyes slowly and spoke without looking at me: “This is where they all got off.”

My skin crawled. I rose again, voice trembling, “I—I need to get off too.”

He nodded, glancing at the rearview mirror. The figures hadn’t moved. He reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a worn notebook. He flipped it open to a page filled with names and times. One name was missing: mine.

“You’re late,” he murmured.

I swallowed hard. The lights dimmed once more, and the rain seemed to hammer harder. The bus slowed to a crawl. Outside, mist clung to the pavement. I peered out the window. Station 13 was a hollow shell of concrete and broken glass, lit by a single flickering streetlamp.

The door hissed open. I hesitated. The driver stared at me, expressionless. I thought of stepping off, but the rain would wash away my footprints—and perhaps everything else I hoped to leave behind.

I slipped out onto the platform. The bus sighed and pulled away, carrying its quiet congregation into the darkness. I stood alone beneath the lamp, water soaking my clothes.

Moments later, I saw them: six silhouettes stepping down from the shadows, moving toward me. Their faces remained hidden, but I recognized the way they moved—stiff, hesitant. The station sign flickered once, then went dark.

I took a step back. They stopped. The silver tracks stretched behind us, gleaming in the wet night. One figure raised a hand, beckoning.

I realized then who they were. The old driver’s notebook. The missing name. The empty seat I’d chosen.

I was the seventh.

As the silhouettes closed in, I felt the cold press around me. The rain fell harder, erasing any trace of my footprints. And behind me, the station sign blinked back to life for one final message:

Welcome to Station 13.
