This is the last time I am going to be writing to you all. 

I realise now that there never was an escape.

It’s waiting for me in the kitchen. There is nowhere left to go, the faces of people I know stare at me through familiar glass. Breath hot against the window. 

When I woke up I was greeted by the sight of my colleagues standing around my house. They haven't done anything yet, I don't suppose they will unless I try to leave. 

Turns out me and Natalie were the last ones to be replaced. I don't even know if the people I grew to know were even the real versions of themselves or not. My trust in everyone around me has shattered and there's nothing left to do except face the music. 

I didn't see any of their bodies in that place, but that doesn't mean they weren't there. Buried amongst the copious loss. They are here to make sure I do my part in their fucked up cycle. How naive I was to think that there was any other option. 

There's a box, sitting atop a crooked pallet in my kitchen. It's soaked in grease and blood and I know exactly why it's there. I know because if I look long enough I can see it for what it truly is. It's a nest, there's little white eggs that cling to the edges of what I once assumed was cardboard. It isn't. It's fleshy and wet with tiny veins pulsating below a thin layer of stretched skin.

I'm surprised it's trying to keep up the illusion, maybe it only looks the way it does to mess with me, break down my mental state enough to make it easier. I know I’m marked for death but I refuse to go out the way it wants me to. 

I spent some time watching the familiar faces at my window. Their eyes tracking my every movement. They started smiling about an hour ago.

Whispered reassurances float through my walls at random intervals now. 

“It’s okay Tyler” 

“we’ll look after you” 

These are the main two things I hear them say. There’s been a few outliers here and there. Natalie stands behind my front door. A gentle knock…knock… knocking of stolen knuckles against a wooden frame as she tells me Natalie is one with her now. 

“Join us” it says in an encouraging and friendly tone, so matter of fact in what it speaks, as if it is gospel. As if I should believe it. 

This isn't my home, I just wanted it so desperately that I fooled myself into blind faith. Didn't stop to question the convenience of it all. I don't know why they play with me like this. To break down their prey? Or maybe it's because they simply enjoy it. 

I don't know anymore. 

How long have I truly been stuck here? Maybe myself and Nat were sucked into this warped reality the moment we started working for the warehouse.

 Maybe It's why only three songs played on that little old radio. 

Or Maybe these things aren't that powerful and it really has been a few weeks but when I try to think back on the people I had seen, the life I had lived for the past year. I can't seem to recall spending any time with my family, or any other friends. 

All I remember is Natalie. 

All I did was work. 

Same route, same times, same faces.

When did I stop noticing that nothing had changed in the past year? 

I had known Natalie for two, we had never been all that close before we started working together, friend of a friend kind of thing. But then we started our new jobs, she was the only one that ever felt real and now I know why. 

It's because she was.  

I think the warehouse is some kind of breeding ground for these things. And I don't think it's the only one that exists. 

So I’m urging you to look back on recent events in your life. Were you stagnant? Does it feel like you're trapped in a monotonous routine? Who have you seen recently? And are you living your life? Or are you simply existing within one. 

I don't think it'll make a difference now if some of you out there are stuck in a similar place but aren't aware yet but maybe if you know sooner than me and Nat did, you can find a way to actually get out. 

I can hear it now, tapping against the box’s edge. It's waiting for me to join it there. There's a strange yet intoxicating smell coming from the pallet now. It's sweet, reminds me of the perfume my mum likes to wear. 

I feel, floaty? Yeah… relaxed now. I know that it's a trap, I still have half a brain left somewhere amongst the thick fog. 

I just simply don't care anymore. 

A part of me feels welcomed, like going into that box will solve all of my problems. I wonder if that's how Natalie felt. 

I know that isn't how she felt when I found her, it's enough of a deterrent for now. Though I don't know how much longer I can fight against its will. 

So I think it’s probably about time. 

I've barricaded myself in my room upstairs. I have something with me that will help get it done. 

I feel calm but I know deep down that I’m scared. 

Can feel it the way my fingers shake. 

It glints under the fake light above me. 

If anyone out there cares enough, can you pass on a message for me? To my mum. Can you tell her that I love her and that I really have missed her. 

Tell her that it wasn't her fault. 

Julia Wilkins, that's her name. 

I hope Natalie found peace. I hope that I do too. That if there really is a God he will forgive me for what I am about to do. 

If there is a God, I have questions for you. 

And if there isn't and this is well and truly the end. I hope it's a restful sleep. I can’t even explain how tired I am. 

This is Tyler Wilkins and I bid you all farewell.
