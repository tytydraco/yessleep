I was lucky that Sheriff Benjamin Lloyd was in his office and not in a squad car waiting to pull me over.I was so disturbed by what I’d seen that I made the twenty-minute drive across town in less than ten. The office was quiet, and Sheriff Lloyd called me into his office right away.

“Yeah, I recognize some of these names.” he grunted, twirling his mustache as he read through the list I’d presented to him. He seemed nervous, but I wasn’t sure why. “Linda Newsome, for instance. She tried to chew the postman’s face off, back in ‘07…”

“What?! She tried to eat someone?”

“Yep. Happened in your store, too…” the sheriff eyed me suspiciously, as though this was somehow my fault. “She came running outta the automotive section and started biting this poor fella. When we finally dragged her off of him, she was screaming about how she’d been lost in the store for weeks, and how she was so, so hungry…”

I shivered; Linda’s story sounded too familiar for comfort.

“Do you have any idea why my grandfather’s name would be on this list? He went missing in a fishing accident…”

“Well, I mean, that’s what we figured. We found his truck in the store lot. Plenty of people parked there and dragged their canoes to the creek across the road…”

“The store lot? You mean Pop’s?!” I couldn’t believe it.

“Course. Back then, Pop’s was the only store there was.”

“So let me get this straight–” I took a deep breath. “You’ve got a bunch of disappearances and murders and weird events that all happen in the same place, and no one has done anything about it?!” Sheriff Lloyd reclined in his chair with a mean glint in his eye, like he was sizing me up for an orange jumpsuit.

“I’m not sure I like what you’re implying, son. We’re talking about very different crimes here. Look, if you take a sixty-year-history of anyplace, you’re bound to find some unexplained deaths and odd happenings. It’s around us all the time; we just don’t pay any attention to it…” the sheriff got to his feet and opened his office door. “I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help, but I need to get back to work.”

“So there won’t be an investigation?” I demanded.

“There already was an investigation,” Lloyd sneered, “Back when I was a deputy. My predecessor, Sheriff Paulson, led it personally.”

“Your predecessor! Could I speak with him, then?”

“Sure you can…if you can find him.” Lloyd handed the list back to me, his finger hovering over the final name: *“James Paulson.”*

I drew some strange looks from customers as I skidded into the “Reserved For Manager” parking spot at Pop’s Grocery, leapt from the car like a drunk, and ran straight for Irene.

I found her beside one of the new automated cash registers I'd installed. The machine had swallowed a customer’s money and was making a hellish whirring sound–until Irene smacked it expertly. The machine made a sad robotic beep and spat out a twenty.

Satisfied, she turned to me.

“You knew.” I snapped, careless of the people around. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

“I used to tell lots of people about what goes on around here. Then some of them disappeared, and I stopped talking so much.” She eyed me coolly. “The more you notice this place, the more it notices YOU.”

I looked helplessly around at the freshly-painted aisles, the bright shelves brimming with the new organic produce I’d ordered, the employees chatting while on break. This place had been my dream, my investment, my hope for the future…what would I do if it failed? I had no idea.

I hung my head.

“You want my advice?” Irene clapped me on the shoulder. “Forget about it. Stay where it’s bright and crowded, ignore anything unusual, get paid at the end of the month and get on with your life. That’s what I do, and forty years later, I’m still here.”

“But what about my grandfather? What about Frank Kelch, Sheriff Paulson, and who knows how many others?!”

“What about them?” Irene sighed. “Look, I like you, kid. You’ve done a lot of good for this place, and I’d hate to see you throw it all away the way those three did.”

I nodded, but inside I was reeling. “Those three,” Irene had said. Was my grandfather investigating Pop’s Grocery when he’d disappeared, like the others were? Grandpa Eddie Lee had been a tough man, an ex-factory machinist whose thoughts didn’t go much deeper than the trivia on the bottom of a beer coaster–or so I’d always thought.

After work, I stayed up past midnight going through my grandfather’s old things. I found something I never would have imagined in a hollowed-out Louis L’Amour novel: my grandfather had kept a diary! It chronicled Frank Kelch’s discovery of the nightmare inside his store, Sheriff Paulson’s investigation, and the three mens’ attempts to explore the strangeness that they’d uncovered. It was full of sketches, expedition-style supply lists, handmade maps, and detailed directions for navigating the surreal labyrinth on the other side of Pop’s Grocery.

The last entry had been made just two days before my grandfather disappeared, and I decided to start there. I knew that there was no way I could sleep after what I’d read, and besides, according to my grandfather’s diary, the “hungry place” inside of Pop’s was most active at night. I loaded up a backpack with everything the diary suggested–spare water and food, light sources, warm clothing, fishing wire–and headed back to Pop’s.

I felt a little silly walking around a grocery store with enough gear for a caving expedition, but soon enough I was glad I had it. The changes began just as they had before, with the unsettling sensation that the aisle I was walking down had gotten just a bit longer than I remembered.

I tied the first roll of fishing wire to the endcap, and when I turned, I experienced that stomach-churning sensation for the second time. The checkered tile floor was stretching out in front of me, extending like a cartoon carpet. The roll of fishing wire whirred, then finally came to a halt. I looked forward, then backward. There was no end to the aisle in which I stood. I hitched the backpack a little higher, hoping that the rattle of the food and water inside would calm my nerves, but it had the opposite effect. My supplies were limited, but the ‘hungry place’  apparently wasn’t. Did it even have an end? And by the time I found it, would I come out raving mad and hungry for anything, even human flesh?

I had been worried that there would be monsters in this hellish ‘other side’ of Pop’s supermarket, but as I trudged down the infinite aisle, I realized I had been mistaken: I’d brought the monsters in with me.

I clung to the fishing wire like a child clinging to a magical rabbit’s foot, repeating to myself again and again that as long as I held it, I was safe. The further I walked, however, the more I began to have my doubts.

The new lamps I had installed were retreating upwards and away, like stars expanding into an empty, lightless universe. Before long, they were just pinpricks in the dark–and then, not even that. I turned on my headlamp and realized that I could see my breath.

I chanced a look at the products on the shelves beside me. At first, they appeared to have been altered in the same way as before–the labels misspelled, the products inside charcoal-gray and strange. Now, however, they were hard to look at: bent, rotten, and wrong. Whatever change was affecting them, it was stronger in the dark. They reached out for me as I passed, as though attracted by the warmth of my blood. The black spots covering them might have been mold…or maybe clusters of eyes. I forced myself to look at the tile floor and keep walking.

And walking. And walking.

The first roll of 3000-meter fishing wire ran out. So did the second. While I was attaching the third to an aisle endcap, the things on the shelf above me began to move. They were no longer simply squirming and squelching: they were actively trying to attack me! Black, writhing shapes wrapped in plastic and cardboard launched themselves off of the shelves to splatter on the checkered tile floor: I could hear slithering in the dark. The splattering became as loud as a heavy rainfall: there were thousands of them. I lost it: I started running.

The backpack hammered against my back. Sweat poured down my forehead, but the sound was fading out. Whatever was back there, I had left it behind–for now.

Something new was ahead of me: a wall of glass-doored refrigerators. I focused the beam of my headlamp left, then right. There was no end to them in either direction, apart from a metal door that I recognized: it led to Pop’s cold storage area. I took a step, then felt a tug.

Another roll of fishing wire had run out.

My throat was dry. I had an insane urge to shout ANYONE HOME? Into the abyss just to break the awful silence of the place, but I knew that making a sound here would be suicide. I couldn’t see what was on the other side of the clouded, freezer-burnt refrigerator doors, and I was pretty sure I didn’t want to. Holding my breath, I tied my second-to-last roll of fishing wire to the handle of the metal door and stepped inside.

There could be no doubt about it: I was in another world [now](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify).
