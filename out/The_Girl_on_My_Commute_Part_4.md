I apologize for being gone for so long without an update. Yes, I am ok. I just had to take time to process everything, and I believe I’m ready to talk about it now. But from here on in, my experience gets even darker.

We all looked at Zoe, a little bit taken aback by her unfavorable situation. Percy was the first to question her. 

“What do you mean you don’t have anything?”

Zoe snapped back. “I mean, I don’t have anything. Not like you guys. Nothing specific, nothing special I guess.”

“You gotta have *something*.” I didn’t realize how harsh my words were. I know my soul was on the line, but that was still no reason to take it out on her. Unfortunately, my lips moved faster than my brain.

“Sorry, I just don’t ok?!” She raised her voice for the first time. It was always so sweet and gentle, it felt surreal to hear it at that volume. Before I could think to apologize, she stormed off to a different car. I genuinely didn’t know what to say or do, until Percy patted my back. 

“Go after her, kid. Don’t worry about us, we’ll be here when you get back.”

I took his advice and followed after Zoe, calling out to her. She kept walking from car to car near the front of the train, while clearly ignoring me.

“Zoe, hey! Zoe, c’mon. You know you literally can’t go any farther than this, please, can we talk?”

She sighed and slumped down in the seat next to her, and motioned her head in a way that asked me to sit next to her. I followed suit and we sat in silence for few seconds. I figured I’d break the tension with an apology. Before I could say a word, she beat me to the punch. 

“I’m sorry, it’s not your fault.”

“No, I shouldn’t have gotten upset. I mean, it’s not your fault either. It’s just this whole thing is insane, and I don’t know what to do.”

“Well you haven’t really had a plan since we started, and you already managed to free Julia. We’ll figure something out for me, just worry about the others for now.”

I turned and looked into her eyes. “I *will* help you. I promise.”

“I hope so, your life is on the line too.” She chuckled weakly. As her laugh faded, she kept her head straight. “You’re a good person, Isaac. Don’t forget that.”

As I got off at my stop, I examined at the objects handed to me by the rest of the group, this time trying to pay attention to any important details. From Percy, an old half dollar coin with John F. Kennedy’s face molded into the side, the numbers below claiming the year 1974. From Claire, a thin necklace with a small but beautiful looking blue pearl in the center. And from Dex, a black pin that said “The Dead Rabbit” in bold purple letters, with a minimalist logo of said rabbit even with tiny flies surrounding it, and his name right below it. It seemed to be some type of name tag. 

After a bit of research, I found that “The Dead Rabbit” was a small bar/sports grill not far from one of the stops. A brass plaque on the bar door confirmed it in curly lettering.

The bar looked nothing like I expected. For a place called The Dead Rabbit, I imagined something darker, maybe gothic—skulls on the shelves and smoke curling from cracks in the walls. But it was warm inside. Dim, yeah, and old, like the floorboards had stories to tell if they ever felt like creaking them out. But it wasn’t creepy. It was… tired.

I stepped inside, clutching the name tag in my pocket. *Dex*. No last name. Just a name, cracked and faded, barely clinging to the little metal rectangle. It was all I had. That and the necklace tucked under my shirt—the one handed to me by Claire. They were both on the train, both stuck, but they didn’t know why. And I couldn’t tell anyone the truth, especially not the man behind the bar.

He looked like the kind of guy who could win a bar fight just by glaring. Late forties, maybe early fifties, beard going gray in patches, arms crossed even while wiping down the same glass for the fifth time. He wore the same name tag, except the name on it was “Charlie”. 

I walked up to the bar and I cleared my throat. “Hey. I was just passing through, and someone mentioned this place.”

He looked up without looking at me. “Uh-huh.”

I pulled the name tag from my pocket, and placed it gently on the counter. “Found this a while ago. Thought it looked familiar. Was wondering if this guy used to work here?”

He picked it up slowly, turned it over in his hand. His face didn’t change much, but I caught the subtle stiffening in his jaw.

“Where’d you get this?”

I shrugged. “Friend of a friend. Said it came from this bar.”

He didn’t answer right away. Just looked down at the tag like it had crawled out of his past and sat on the bar to haunt him.

He stared at the tag a moment longer, jaw tightening. “Dex. Yeah, he worked here. Long time ago. He was good,” the man muttered. “Reliable. People liked him. Never said much. Just… showed up one day. Like he belonged.”

I leaned casually on the counter, trying to seem harmless. Curious, but not too curious. “What happened to him?”

He narrowed his eyes. “Why are you asking?”

“I don’t know,” I said carefully. “Guess I’m into people’s stories. Especially the ones no one tells anymore.”

He studied me as if weighing each word I said. Then, after a long beat, he muttered, “Come with me. I got a few things left of his in the office. Never could bring myself to throw ’em out.”

I followed him through a narrow hallway lined with crooked frames. We passed a few photo of different people standing in front of the bar, each from different years. What stopped me was in the 90’s frame. It was Dex, the resemblance was uncanny, only his hair a little shorter. I was definitely in the right place. 

The office was dim and cluttered, and smelled like paper and whiskey. He pulled open a drawer in the desk and took out a small wooden box. Inside was a broken bottle opener, a photo, a few matchbooks, and a sketchbook with some worn pencils. “This all that’s left,” he said. “Funny how lives can shrink down to little scraps like this.”

He ran a hand through his hair, then sat. I stayed standing. Not moving. Not speaking. But I wasn’t here to get his stuff, I needed to see what Dex meant to him. 

I asked “So what else did Dex do around here? Were you two close?”

He didn’t look up. “Something like that.”

I kept trying to pry for more information but he just kept giving me vague answers. I was clearly getting nowhere until I noticed the picture on his desk that made my heart drop. It was him and a woman with a curly afro, and wearing the same necklace with a blue pearl, the same one hidden around my neck. It was Claire. 

I shifted the conversation, “Who’s that?” I pointed to the picture. 

“Don’t worry about it.” His speech was slow and methodical. 

I pressed on. “Is that your wife? You seem happy, where is she now? Does she work here?” I didn’t realize I was asking too many questions until he snapped at me. 

“That’s none of your business! I don’t who you think you are, asking questions of people who don’t concern you, but I gave you Dex’s things. Now get out of here-”

Then his eyes drifted somewhere else and stopped. “What’s that?”

My breath caught. I looked down. The edge of the necklace had slipped from under my shirt, the pearl just barely visible. Before I could hide it, he stood, walked around the desk, and stopped in front of me.

“Where did you get that?”

I hesitated. “It—it was given to me. I just saw it in the picture, I didn’t know it was hers.”

His face twisted with something sharp and aching. He reached out—not grabbing, just hovering—then took it gently off of my neck, I didn’t stop him.

“This was Claire’s,” he said, voice low. “My wife.”

I didn’t say anything, I couldn’t. He held up the necklace, eyes distant from me now, like something was opening up inside him.

“She wore it every day. Even when things got bad between us. I think it reminded her of something. Or someone.”

He glanced down at the name tag in his other hand.

“They left together,” he said finally. “Her and Dex. One random night, no note. Just… gone. And I hated them for it. For a long time. Who knows where she is now, I never looked into it. I figured it’d be better that way.” He looked up at me, eyes tired. “But I loved her more than I hated them.”

He held the necklace in one hand and the name tag in the other, like the weight of memory had finally found its balance. And in that moment—I felt it. Like the air shifted and thickened. Something old, buried, was waking up. I didn’t need to see it to know: the memories were flowing. The truth locking itself into place. Dex and Claire. What they were, what they ran from, what they meant to each other. What they left behind. Charlie sighed, long and hollow. He set the name tag gently back into the box, then the necklace beside it.

“I don’t know why you’re really here, kid,” he said quietly. “But… thanks for asking in the first place. Seeing this again, I think I’m at peace now. I’ve accepted I might never see her again. But I do like the memories.”

I nodded, heart thudding. “Some stories deserve to be remembered.”

He left me alone for a moment to grab something from another cabinet. I moved quickly and the necklace slipped back into my pocket like it had never left. The weight of it was warmer now. By the time he turned back around, I was at the doorway, holding the box he gave me, expression neutral. I thanked him. He nodded.

And I walked out of The Dead Rabbit with both objects in my pocket and something far more important—memory—wrapped around them like a pulse. Dex and Claire were waiting. And now, maybe, they were ready to be free.

The air had thickened while I was inside—humid, still. Like the whole city was holding its breath. I tugged my jacket tighter around me, fingers brushing the necklace in my pocket, the name tag resting against it. Still warm. Still pulsing faintly with memory.

I took a few steps down the street, keeping to the shadows. That’s when I noticed him.
A man, maybe mid-thirties, leaning against the brick wall just outside the alley to the left. Too still. Too quiet. A cigarette smoldered in his fingers, but he wasn’t smoking it. He was just watching me.

“Nice night,” he said. I didn’t stop walking.

“You’ve got something,” he called after me. His voice—calm, casual—curdled my blood. I froze, halfway down the block.

“You’ve felt it, haven’t you? That weight. That buzz under your skin.” He pushed off the wall and started walking toward me, slow and steady. “Memories that don’t belong to you. Echoes.”

I turned slightly, just enough to meet his eyes, which now only showed two endless pits shrouded in darkness.

My throat tightened. “Do I know you?”

“You should,” he said, grinning. “We’ve never met, but we’re always watching, remember?“

No. Not again. I could tell by the cold vapor of my breath that this was another monster sent by the Thin Man. I stepped back, only to see his face begin to *split*. Not like a wound, but like a transformation, similar to the nurse in the hospice. The skin peeled sideways, his jaw cracking unnaturally wide. Eyes bulged, teeth jagged and too many, stretching from cheek to cheek. His fingers bent backward, nails curling into claws. A black, tar-like substance dripped from his mouth, steaming where it hit the pavement.

“You shouldn’t be meddling,” the thing hissed. “They’re *meant* to forget.”

I ran with what little energy I had. Behind me, I heard the thing drop onto all fours with a wet slap and begin to chase. The sound it made was somewhere between a snarl and laughter—high-pitched and bubbling. I cut down an alley, then another, vaulting a trash bin, skidding around corners slick with puddles. The buildings blurred around me, but I knew where I was going. I had to make it to the train, it wasn’t too far. 

I looked ahead to see a nearby basketball court. If I cut through, I could probably make it. I threw the box over the fence and leaped onto it, climbing as fast as I could, but it wasn’t fast enough. I felt the creature’s claws dig into my leg, its tar dripping on my calf. I managed to pull away and tumble over the fence, landing on my back. When my vision came to, the monster was gone, though I could still hear his laugh in my head. 

I scraped up the contents of the box and made my way over to the station, almost limping to the back of the cars. Everyone was concerned seeing what bad shape I was in. Zoe ran over and saw my leg was bleeding, but I assured her I’d be fine. It became clear I had to tell them the whole truth, about my deal with the Thin Man, and how his “friends” were watching me. 

I showed them the box of Dex’s stuff, and he froze when he saw the sketchbook.

“I was…an artist?” He never sounded so confused yet sincere. He looked through it to find several drawings of Claire. That must’ve been how he showed his love. He stopped when he saw there was one last empty page. He smiled and looked at Claire with stars in his eyes, gesturing that he’d like to draw her one more time. She shared that same gaze, and she crossed her legs as he grabbed a worn pencil and got to work. 

The way that looked at each other was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. What seemed like an unjust affair, really looked like two people appreciating each other and their beauty. It really seemed like love. 

When he finished, I felt the glow from the necklace and the name tag in my pockets. It was warm, it felt like it was alive. The two looked at me in amazement. 

Claire was the first to speak. “Does…does that mean..?”

I nodded. “Yeah, are you ready?”

Dex and Claire touched their respective objects and I was once again hit with the same blinding light. Like Julia, we stepped out of the train into a white void. 

A black-and-white reel flickered to life around us—grainy, colorless, soundless, like watching someone else’s dream.

We stood there, in the middle their memory. Claire and Dex were there, younger, real. Laughing through the silence. Her hair curled like waves around her cheeks. He looked lighter, like the world hadn’t quite landed on his shoulders yet. They stood at a bench in a desolate, empty train station, arms around each other. No other people, no trains, just them. And two small paper cups. She lifted hers to her lips and so did he. Then—just like that—they slid down onto the bench, leaning against each other as their bodies stilled, still smiling. 

The void faded back around us like fog unrolling. Dex’s eyes were wide. Claire’s hand had flown to her mouth. She whispered, “We died here.”

There was no drama in it. No scream. Just quiet acceptance. Like they had always known, deep down. 

Dex looked at her. “We were running.”

Claire nodded. “But not away. We just wanted a way…out.” She grabbed Dex’s hand. “I’m glad it was with you.”

They looked at me—really looked.

“Thank you,” Claire said softly, her voice warm. Clear. Whole.

Dex stepped forward and placed the name tag in my palm, I could hear his voice breaking. “I’ve been on that train for so long, I…thanks, kid.” 

Claire added the necklace, pressing it gently into my fingers. “It belongs to you now.”

As I headed back to the train, I turned back one last time to see them walking hand in hand, finally free. Three down, two to go. 

“You really did it,” said Zoe, flopping down in the seat across from me, copper curls bouncing around her shoulders. Her freckles lit up like constellations in the dim light of the train car.

Beside her stood Percy, always buttoned-up, even in death—tie straight, coat folded neatly over one arm, like he still had a meeting to get to. He gave a small, respectful nod.

“I’ve seen people try,” Percy said. “They don’t usually get that far, let alone survive it twice. At this rate, you’ll empty the train before your time’s up. Although, I think mine might be a bit more difficult.”

I offered a small smile, but I didn’t feel like celebrating. Not yet. “*He’s* not going to like it,” I said.

Percy’s expression darkened. Zoe sat up straighter. That was when the cold hit, the temperature dropping like a trapdoor under our feet, which only meant one thing . It rolled in like fog, thick and heavy, turning my breath to ice. As it curled over my mouth, the windows frosted over instantly. Zoe and Percy saw the shift in my face as I looked behind them. They turned, only to join in my horror. 

It was the Thin Man, and he did *not* seem pleased.
