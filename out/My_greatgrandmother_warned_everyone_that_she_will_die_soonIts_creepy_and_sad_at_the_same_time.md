(According to my mother and relatives, this literally happened.)

A short background story:  My family comes from the Balkans, we are a multi-ethnic Roma family, which is not unusual for families from that region. But in the story my mother told me, it’s about my Bulgarian Roma great-grandmother and how she once warned my mother.

I unfortunately never had the chance to meet my great-grandmother, as she died about eight years before I was born. Ever since my great-grandfather passed away, she became somewhat of an outsider — she was the only Bulgarian in the family, her mother tounge was Bulgarian, and the rumor that she possessed “unnatural powers” didn’t help. My mother, who was her favorite, is still convinced to this day that she indeed had such powers. She’s told me several stories about them, but now I’ll get to the main story.

My mother was in her early twenties when she went visit my great-grandmother. She was supposed to stay for just a few weeks, but in the end, it turned into months. She said that everything was normal at first, she helped my great-grandmother around the house, but also went out with friends. However, when she finally wanted to go back, my great-grandmother stopped her and supposedly said: 

“Please don’t go, my child. I will die soon — please stay here.”

My mother was puzzled, she had never said anything like that before. My mother’s aunts told her she was “just talking nonsense” because of her old age. But my great-grandmother cried when my mother wanted to leave. In the last moment, my mother decided to stay a few more days, which, as I said, became months, two in total. Eventually, my mother had enough, she argued more and more with my great-grandmother and couldn’t take it anymore.

One day, she packed her things. A relative was going to drive her back. Before leaving, they argued again. My great-grandmother simply said in a mocking tone: 

“Well, you won’t get far.”

 My mother replied: 

“Are you cursing me?” 

And my great-grandmother only said: 

“You’ll be back here soon enough — to bury me.”


 My mother ignored her. In the end, they managed to say goodbye normally, but my great-grandmother still seemed very confident about her claims.

Now, from what my mother was told afterwards by her relatives who were there:

On the very same day, my great-grandmother suddenly came out of the house and told my aunts, who were in the front yard: “Come quickly, the time has come. I am going to leave you — I’m going to die.” My aunts didn’t believe her, but they followed her inside. They found her carefully laying out my great-grandfather’s belongings on the bed. They didn’t know why she was doing it. Then she lay down, closed her eyes, kept breathing… and breathing… and breathing… and then… she was gone.

My mother arrived back in her hometown around midnight. She had just entered her apartment when she got a call, it was one of her aunts. She said: “Grandma has died. Come back.” My mother truly hadn’t gotten far at all, and she went back to bury her grandmother...

On the day of the funeral, everyone was in the house. The atmosphere was, of course, heavy and sad. Then suddenly, they heard laughter outside, children’s laughter. At first they ignored it, but after a while it became annoying. My mother and one of her aunts went outside to shoo the children away, but there were none. They looked and looked — my mother said they really wanted to find where the laughter was coming from, it sounded so close. Then suddenly, one of her aunts looked up at the sky, smiled, and said something that still gives me goosebumps: “So, she has arrived. Her children are welcoming her — can’t you hear how happy they are?”

For context: My great-grandmother had lost some of her children in her lifetime, which had always weighed heavily on her and my mom and her relatives thought that those laughters weren't just children or bad spirits, but a sign, that she made it to the gates of heaven, and that they shouldn't worry.
