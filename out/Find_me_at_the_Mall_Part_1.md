Honestly, I don’t know where to begin. I spent hours searching this damned mall for any semblance of a computer that could connect to the internet. Of all places, I’m sitting in the manager’s office of a Spencer’s. I should probably explain exactly what I’m doing here. There used to be a mall that resided in Neenah Wisconsin, I think it was called “New View.” I used to work there as a Janitor, walking around this large mall and just kinda cleaning what I find. Due to me working at night, I often found myself bored and watching a bunch of videos on my phone. A lot of the stores were closed, abandoned and empty. So, what did need cleaning was very minimal. I often thought it was all a bad dream, I still do even as I write this. As much as I’d like to get into the whole backstory of why I’m here, let me be clear, I got no clue how or why. I remember falling asleep in the break room after a long day, and then boom, I was here, in this Backrooms knock-off. So, what do I know? Well, I’m alone, until I found this computer, I went a whole day of just looking around. I know that the food court is constantly refilling itself from some unknown force, always fresh and hot though, I can’t complain too much. Lastly, I know I’m stuck here, I tried the doors, they open, but when I walk through, they just loop me back into the mall. I did this for hours my first night here, before I gave up and went to a small Furniture store here to sleep. 

However, I’ll add this, I lied when I said I was alone. Sure, there are no other humans here, but there is a place that didn’t exist in the mall until I came here. It’s a Bar and Grill called Zapp’s, which is interesting, considering the wolf and lion animatronic that’s in there. Zapp, the wolf, is designed like an old mobster, he’s got a Boston accent and often make jokes about alcoholism, alimony, and any other topic a “divorced parent” would have. Was funny the first time, got old fast. On the other hand, there was the king. A 9-foot-tall lion animatronic dressed like, well, “The King.” They were shut down; I couldn’t get them to work at all no matter what I tried. But Zapp worked just fine, I found myself last night sitting and experimenting with the electronics and controls of the animatronic that they used. Turns out, it was modern tech, and easy to learn. Granted, each button is labled. I figured out how to connect my own downloaded music from my phone to the show, so I ended up making him say some line like “Here’s another one of my favorite songs I drown my woes away with.” And then immediately put on something like “Party in the USA” or “Around the World.” It gave me a good laugh, and I remember falling asleep there. That leads to this morning, returning to this computer while searching for ones that connect to the internet. I can hear something in the distance right now, I’m trying to ignore it, but, dammit, it sounds like it’s calling my name. I don’t know, I’ll probably ignore it for now and explore this place some more, see what I can find. I’ll update you all when I can, until then, you can find me at the mall, maybe leave a gift, I have something I want to try.
