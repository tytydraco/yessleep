I know it sounds like a stupid childhood nightmare. Everyone says that when you tell them about monsters. But what I experienced still feels real. I was nine back then. Today I’m an adult — at least on paper — but at night I still sleep with my back against the wall.

My mother had one sentence she kept repeating.

“If you see them… just say nothing.”

Not “everything will be okay.”  
Not “I’ll protect you.”  
Just that one sentence, spoken as if it were a rule older than both of us.

I started seeing them shortly after my father left. He didn’t disappear dramatically. No arguments. No shouting. No police cars. He simply packed a bag quietly and walked out. No explanation. No goodbye. Just an empty space in the hallway where his shoes used to be.

The first night after that, something was standing in my room.

I was lying awake, staring at the ceiling, counting the cracks in it, when I heard it — that quiet breathing. Not my own. A second one, slower, too deep for a human.

I didn’t turn around right away. I felt it first. Cold. As if someone had stopped the air itself.

Then I did it anyway.

In the corner stood a figure, taller than the door, too long in every way — arms too long, neck too long, fingers too long. Its eyes looked like holes at first. Then I realized they weren’t holes at all, but something black shimmering inside them, as if something was moving beneath the surface.

It didn’t say anything. But its mouth opened. Not quickly. Inch by inch. As if the jaw were quietly cracking.

I screamed.

My mother ran in, switched on the light — and, as always, there was nothing there.

I was shaking, pointing, barely able to speak. She just looked at me for a long moment. Then she knelt beside me, placed a hand on the back of my head, and whispered:

“You mustn’t talk to them. You mustn’t look at them. You mustn’t feed them. You mustn’t say anything. Then they’ll leave.”

“What are they?” I asked.

She didn’t answer.

She pulled the curtains closed, turned off the light, and left me alone.

I thought that would be the end of it. But they came back.

Not every night — only when the house was especially quiet. When the refrigerator didn’t hum. When no cars passed by. When I felt like the world had forgotten me.

I learned to stay still. I held my breath. I didn’t move. I pretended to sleep.

They didn’t like being noticed.

One of them often crawled under my bed. I heard the scraping of its nails against the wooden frame. Another would stand right next to my ear. I felt cold breath in my hair. Sometimes they whispered, but not in words I understood — more like wind passing through hollow wood.

The wardrobe sometimes moved on its own. Just a little. Just enough for the gap to turn black and for something inside to blink.

I told my teacher eventually. He laughed and said imagination was a wonderful thing. I learned not to say anything anymore.

But then something changed.

They started looking at my mother.

I noticed it first in the kitchen. I was sitting at the table, she was cutting bread. Behind her, in the doorway, stood one of the figures. It wasn’t just in my room anymore. It was here, in the light. It leaned over her, its jaw almost touching her shoulder. And my mother did — nothing. She kept cutting. As if no one were there.

I clenched my teeth.  
I wasn’t allowed to talk.  
I wasn’t allowed to say anything.

Then the figure turned toward me.

Slowly. Head first. The body followed with a delay, as if moving through water.

It knew I could see it.

I was the only one close to breaking the rule.

For the first time, I wondered whether the rule was really meant to protect them — or my mother.

At night, I sometimes heard her talking quietly through the wall. Not to me. Not on the phone. Pauses. Whispering. As if she were waiting for answers I couldn’t hear.

Eventually, I decided not to stay silent anymore.

That was a mistake.

That night, it was especially cold. The heating worked, but my room felt as if someone had deliberately turned the temperature down. I heard the crawling. The breathing. I knew they were all there.

I sat up.

One stood directly in front of my bed. It almost reached the ceiling. Its head was tilted, its mouth too wide, its skin gray, as if stretched too tightly over bone. Its fingers touched the mattress.

“What do you want?” I whispered.

The room grew even quieter.

Something moved behind it. More of them. The darkness was full of joints.

The tall one leaned down toward me. Its mouth was right in front of my face now. I saw something inside — not teeth. Something like hands. Many small ones.

Then I heard my mother in the hallway.

Don’t come in, I thought. Not now.

The door opened. Light spilled in. She looked at me — and then she saw them.

I recognized it in her eyes. Not surprise. Not shock.

Recognition.

She had known all along that they were real.

She looked at me, and there was no panic in her gaze — only strict fear. The kind you see when someone yells at a child who’s standing too close to a cliff.

“You talked to them,” she said.

Behind her, in the hallway, there were more. They filled the walls, bent beneath the ceiling. Their heads twitched sharply, as if they had smelled something.

Me.

“What… are they?” I whispered.

She closed her eyes, as if she had been waiting for that question and still had no answer.

“They don’t hear us,” she said. “They only hear you.”

Then she said the sentence I will never forget:

“And now they won’t go away anymore.”

The figures moved closer. The tall one in front of my bed placed its hand on my chest. It didn’t feel heavy — just cold. Colder than metal left outside in winter. I couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t scream. My mother just stood there, silently crying.

The light flickered.

Something pulled at me. Not my body.

More like a thought that didn’t belong to me.

I tipped to the side and looked under my bed. Eyes. So many eyes. All focused on me. All waiting.

Then everything went black.

I woke up in my bed the next morning. My mother was sitting beside me. The curtains were tightly closed, the door locked. She looked like she hadn’t slept all night.

“You have to learn to stay quiet,” she said hoarsely. “You’re still alive. That’s more than can be said.”

“Where did Dad go?”  
I don’t know why I asked.

She didn’t answer.

But I knew.

They hadn’t taken him. He had left because he knew they would stay.

I’m old enough now to dismiss all of this as imagination. Trauma. Loss. Childhood fantasy. That would be the easy explanation.

But sometimes, when the house grows quiet again, I hear it scratching under the bed. The wardrobe shifts slightly. The air turns cold. And I feel the pressure on my chest, gentle, almost caring.

They are patient.

They know I’ll talk again someday.

And my mother isn’t here anymore to warn me.

Now they say it to me themselves:

“Just say nothing”
