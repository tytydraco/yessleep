I was walking up the hill to my house after school, when all of a sudden the wind stopped cold and the weather went from freezing to warm. It was the end of autumn in New Hampshire and it shouldn’t have felt as cozy outside as it did. That’s when I saw them for the first time in person… the dancing spiral of orange and yellow leaves. Even with no wind nor breeze, these leaves danced anyway. Almost as if they were alive, they then proceeded to chase me all the way to my house. Even at full sprint up my hill, I couldn’t feel the faintest bit of gust hit my face the whole way. Along with the leaves there was a voice. A booming voice that sounded like steam coming out of a teapot. And this voice was hissing my name…

“Shaun!”

I would say that’s the weirdest part of it all but it’s not. The weirdest part was that I had seen it in my dreams. Just like everyone else on my street. If you haven’t read the first part I suggest you do, because I don’t want to waste my time reintroducing everyone. So now, this is where we left off.

The leaves never left my mind. They haunted me every minute of every day. They lingered at the back of my mind even when I was occupied. Has anyone else who had the same dreams seen them? I don’t know. Maybe I should find out.

I got off the bus at my stop and said my usual “thank you”. It was quite chilly this afternoon but I hadn’t really noticed that until it had suddenly become kind of hot. Still not processing what the change in weather could mean, I just took off my jacket and tied it around my waste. While walking up the hill I say them again. They danced there almost antagonistically. When I saw them I started to get startled again and almost screamed out my mom’s name but stopped. Instead I just stopped and stood there, watching them. Almost felt like they were watching me back.

They slowly began to move towards me and lost their elegant spiral. Less of a breeze and more of a hover, the leaves came over and swirled around my feet. I closed my eyes tight and cringed. Could this idiotic act of curiosity be my undoing? I don’t know yet. What I do know is that I heard the voice again.

“Shaun…”

I replied. I actually freaking replied. 

“W-what do you want?” I said, slowly loosening my body and prying my eyes open.

I got no answer. At least, not right away. I had completely stopped shrugging and my eyes were fully open. I was looking into the sky as if looking for whoever or whatever was calling my voice. That’s when I remembered I had a bunch of leaves hovering off the ground around me. I had almost forgotten about the voice when I heard a screeching cry for help.

In the same misty screech I heard, “Help us!”

It caused me to shrug back up and cover my ears. The leaves on the ground had vibrated and moved around almost as if reacting to the sound as well. 

“W-what?” I cowardly ask.

The leaves speedily darted away from me and made me jump from startlement. They had picked back up to their dancing spiral of wind. Once again it was just me and it staring at each other. The funnel shape had started to sway like a snake and slithering into the bushes behind it. When it was almost completely out of sight because of the branches in the way, it stopped and stood still. I just stared at it for a moment before looking up the hill towards my house. I could just make out the top of the house and could see the lights coming from our windows. Inside were my mom and dad patiently waiting for me to come home, but I wasn't thinking of that at the moment. I looked back towards the leaves and took my first steps towards them.

Off the road and onto the parallel sidewalk from mine, I was now at the edge of the woods across from my house. I hadn’t been in this forest for a long time. The eeriness of them had always just repelled me from exploring. So for the first time in forever, I stepped into the dead leaves that had drowned in the shadows of the branches above. 

I pushed my way through thick bushes and probably have tics that I still need to search myself for. The spiral of leaves I followed was somehow visually separated by all the other leaves around them. They were moving so smoothly and elegantly through our thickly settled environment, that I couldn’t help but feel awe looking at them. I’m pretty sure that most of the time walking I was actually looking at the leaves more than my own feet, which I should have been doing. 

After a little while we came to a small clearing where the leaves then reverted back to hovering silently right off the ground. I could also feel a transition in myself as well. I suddenly had a sense of fear, almost like I was being watched. I creepily followed the leaves where we made it to the edge of a larger clearing, barley a few yards away. This clearing was not empty like the last one. The ground was grass and clear of leaves, but there were cut down trees with large burrows in them. On the adjacent edge of the clearing was also ground protruding upwards like a small hill and in it, a cave mouth. At first glance I didn’t notice anything besides that. I soon realised however, that there were small constructions of twigs around the stumps and cave. The twig structures included what looked like racks, spitting pits with char in them, stools, compartments, and baskets. 

“What is this place?” I quietly spoke to myself. 

I thought the leaves were responding to me when they started vibrating. Perhaps it was to warn me that I had almost walked into a big open pit. When I looked into it I gasped loudly. There were, and I swear, what looked like big bones and meat down there. They were half buried in dirt so I couldn’t tell what it even was, but the smell definitely helped me come to that conclusion. The stench made me make an auditory gagging sound.

“SHHhhhh…” The leaves breathed into my ear. I almost forgot that they talked to me and it made me jump a little.

I tiptoed around the pit and into the center of this tiny town in the woods. The baskets were made of twigs and rope and filled with sand. Each of them sat outside a decently sized bottom of a tree that was hollowed out like a small home. Inside were some small blankets made of outdoors materials, but also some blankets that clearly belonged to kids. The blankets were almost arranged in a way like a dog or cat was sleeping on them.

Some of the racks had long sharpened sticks in them. Others that were smaller held arrow-like pieces of wood. Next to these small racks were little jars made of clay and rock. In these jars were crushed up frogs, mushrooms, and plants. It smelled disgusting so I turned my attention to the roasting spit. As soon as I looked down at the charcoal I froze. Inside was a fresh ribcage about the size of mine and I’m 5’4”. I untensed when I realized it was just a pig or something. After all, that's what my dad uses in our more modern roasting spit in the backyard. 

I started walking over to the small cave mouth, when I heard rustling in the woods just ahead of me. It startled me and I looked back for the leaves but they weren’t there. I have no idea how long it had been till I realised that the breeze and cold was back. I put my jacket back on to soothe my shaking arms. It was also getting really dark. Why did I follow those leaves for so long? It’s the middle of December for crying out loud. I was curious but shouldn’t have been so stupid to stay out that late. Even with this, I wasn’t in as much of a hurry to get out of there until I heard the voices.

It was not the same hissing, windy voice from before. These voices were more groggily yet high pitched and sounded mischievous. They were talking amongst themselves animalistically, and about to come into the clearing. Worried about what animal this could be, I sprinted back the way I came from narrowly dodging falling into the pit. The pack of animals sounded confused and murmured amongst themselves before suddenly screaming as if realisation hit them that I was there. They all started running after me and this caused me to drop my silence and start screaming. I screamed as loud as I could for help, and hoped it would scare these things away.

It felt like I was running for forever when I suddenly bumped into someone. I heard a familiar oof sound come from them. Don’t worry, it was just my mom. She started to ask me what I was doing out there but was cut off by the sounds of the animals gaining on me. She helped me get up and we rushed out of the forest and into our house.

My mom slammed the door behind me and locked it. This caught my dad’s attention.

“Honey? What took you two so long? I was kinda getting worried.”

My mom ignored him and crouched down to my eye level.

“What do you think you were doing?! You could have gotten hurt! There were literally coyotes chasing you!”

Almost as if he was following a code, my dad ran over and unmounted his gun from the wall and opened the door.

“Those fucking bastards. Killed the neighbor's cat too.”

My mom shot him a look and snapped, “Donald, language!”

The rest of the night was short and I was kind of dazed through most of it. I ate dinner that I don’t remember what it tasted like, unconsciously talked to my mom and dad, and then went to bed. I couldn’t sleep though, so I stayed up to write all this. I have to “wake up” in less than an hour now and haven’t gotten any sleep. I should probably go to bed now, but I want to know what people think about this place I found. Should I call the police? Was I just trespassing on someone’s campsite? If so, then if I call the police I’ll be in trouble. It’s not illegal to have a camp in the woods after all, right? So what if they just leave a ribcage in the fire pit? It’s not a crime to be a slob either. Plus I’d have to say I was following leaves that I saw in my dream. I’m thinking too much. I really need to sleep. I’ll update this tomorrow. 

I was absolutely exhausted this morning. Patrick kept trying to talk to me in our classes but I was basically on autopilot and don’t even remember if I responded to him once. Hopefully he doesn’t take it personally. He even had to wake me up in history so I wouldn’t get in trouble. No matter how exhausted I was though, I could not stop thinking about what had occurred the night prior. Those animalistic chuckles will forever be implanted in my mind. Even if they were just coyotes, being out there all by myself in the woods was nightmare fuel. I don’t even remember being scared until the leaves had ditched me and the cold air returned. 

I kept looking for the leaves on my way home this morning, but didn’t see them anywhere. Maybe because my dad was there. It felt like kids on the bus were making fun of me when my mom was waiting for me not too long ago. I could feel their gazes once again now that, once again, I had a parent at the bus stop. All just to walk a few yards.

“Don’t get any funny ideas.” My dad said almost jokingly. I could tell he wasn’t as mad as my mom was.

We ate dinner silently and I went to my room right after. Shortly after, my mom was knocking at my door. 

I sighed, “Come in.”

“Hi sweety.” She said as she found a spot to sit on the bed by my legs. “You never told me why you were out there last night.”

“Huh? Oh. I… I saw the leaves again and I followed them.” I almost had forgotten that I told her about them and was about to make up some poor excuse. 

“Why would you do that? You don’t know what kind of spirit that could have been. What if it wanted to hurt you?” Sorrow and worry filled her voice. 

“I- a spirit? I hadn’t thought of that. Umm, I guess I followed them because I thought I heard them say help.” I never believed in any of this stuff, so what was happening with the leaves was beyond me. 

My mom lost eye contact with me and looked towards the floor, her eyes darting back and forth like she was thinking about something. She looked back up at me and put on an assuring smile. 

“It’s going to be alright honey. Just promise me you won’t run off like that again.”

I nodded my head slowly. “I promise. I didn’t mean to scare you like that.”

“It’s alright sweetie.” She pinched my cheek and kissed me on the forehead before leaving my room. 

I rolled over in bed and slept peacefully through the night. No dreams, nor nightmares. Just the peaceful void behind my eyelids.

I came home today after game club and my mom was waiting for me at the bus stop. I got off the bus with a smile expecting one back but she didn’t even look at me until I said her name. She had been looking off into the woods and not even blinking. She just stood there and scanned the tree line like she was looking for something or someone.

“Mom?”

“Oh hi sweetie! How was school today?” She snapped her attention towards me.

“Um, it was alright. What were you looking at?”

“Huh? Oh. Thought I- thought I saw a coyote.”

We went back home and enjoyed our chicken with Mac and cheese. All my mom could talk about were her scary stories from when she was little. When she was younger, she lived in a log cabin with grandpa and grandma. She would always tell me about the bears she’d hear outside her cabin at night, ghosts moving stuff around, and eerie silhouettes of “shadow people”. Grandpa would just tell us it was her imaginary friend, but still couldn’t explain why things were rearranged in the kitchen. Me and my dad just glanced at each other all night and rolled our eyes. 

When I had dessert and was ready to sleep I looked over to see my mom looking out the front window. She was staring at the woods again like she was waiting for something. 

“Mom?”

“Yeah?” She said, not even looking away from the forest.

“Why do you keep looking at the trees?”

“I’m not. I’m just- just looking outside. It’s supposed to snow tomorrow. I’m excited.”

“It is? Do you think I’ll have school?”

“Probably. It’s not supposed to be too bad. You should still get some sleep though. You never know.” She had finally pulled her attention away from the window.

We walked to my room and said our goodnights. I get that she believes in the paranormal, but it was startling to get a bit weird. I could tell what she was looking for.

“Damn man. I was really hoping we wouldn’t have school today.” Patrick whined, slouching in his chair.

“What would you do all day anyway?”

“I don’t know dude. Maybe invite you over or something.”

“If school was canceled, I don’t think my mom would even drive me if the buses couldn’t even drive on the road.” 

WHAT’S UP REDDIT!!!

Sorry, Patrick wrote that. He saw me writing the conversation we had last class on my laptop. He took it and obligated himself to add that in. Said he’d whoop my ass at Boss Monster next game club if I removed it. He wouldn’t stand a chance but I think it’s funny so I’ll keep it.

She’s gone. We don’t know where she is. I came home to police cars outside our house and one of the officers was taking a statement from my dad. It went like this:

“Dad?! What’s happening?! Where’s mom?!” 

“Not now.”

“But dad,”

“I SAID NOT NOW! I’m- I’m trying as hard as I can.”

I overheard my dad talking to the office as I snuck by them and into the house.

“I don’t know. She just left me a note saying that she ‘saw something like Shaun did’ and was going to go help. I don’t know what she’s talking about.”

I did. I knew. She must have seen the leaves, just as I did, and followed them into the woods. She must have taken my dads rifle with him because another officer was taking pictures of the mount where it used to be.

I walked into my room and found a paper on my bed. On it was a note from my mom that said,

Sweetheart,
I saw something like you did and decided to go after it in hopes that I could help those poor spirits. It wasn’t leaves though. I can still see it from outside your window! It’s a spiral of sand and it’s waiting for me. I promise to be home later, please don’t let your father worry. I wrote him a note too, telling him what you had seen and heard all those nights ago. Ugh he’s going to think I’m crazy. I love you sweetie and I’ll be back in time to make dinner. I promise.
Love, mom.

I started to recall something about what my mom had written before I felt a hand on my shoulder. It made me jump a little.

“Sorry to startle you Shaun, I just have a few questions.” Said the same officer that had been talking with my dad.

My dad stood behind him, looking very anxious. “It’s alright son. Tell him what you know.”

“What’s this?” The officer asked, looking at the note in my hands.

“Oh uh, it’s a note from my mom. She said… she said she saw a spiral of sand and was going after it into the woods.”

“Mind if I have it? Going to give it to our detective so we can find your mom as quickly as possible.” The officer held out his hand, expecting the paper.

I looked down at it one last time and just read the words “Love, mom” one last time before I watched it slip away and out of my hands. 

As of me writing this, the police and my dad are in the woods looking for my mom with a small search party. I probably won’t be getting much sleep tonight. All I can think about is her hugging me and telling me she loves me. This is how she must have felt when I went missing, but even I wasn’t out this late. She has to make it back, she has to. I don’t know what I’d do if anything happened to her.

I love you too mom. Please come home.
