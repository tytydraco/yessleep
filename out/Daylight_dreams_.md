Growing up I always had vivid dreams, or I guess you could call them nightmares. The degree always varied but that’s not what was important. It took me till I was about twelve for me to realize they weren’t your standard traipse through the subconscious realm. 

I woke up smelling mold, at least it felt like I woke up. I knew this feeling well as it was the tail tale sign of switching from realities but at the minute I couldn’t tell which one I was entering. That damp mildew smell the reminds you of cleaning a damp basement or exploring an abandoned house for a cool hide out. 

I was in the woods, something that made me excited at first but quickly left a pit weighing heavy in my stomach. I wandered forward hoping to see my brown paint horse Animus. 

When I had first told my mom about him she tilted her head and chuckled a warm note. 

“Why that name and not like, Patches or Applejack?” She said poking my shoulder teasingly at the mention of her catching me watching my little sister’s show without her once or twice. 

I bateted her away grinning “I didn’t pick his name, he just had it when I found him.”

She looked at me like what I said was a tad odd but only shook her head and sighed, a grin painted across her sun kissed and freckled face. 

Animus didn’t show this time and without his presence I felt a little more anxious and weary. That was never a good sign. The next time I turned a tree I was in my fourth grade classroom. The desks were still in the same arrangement as I could last recall. Even including the lone desk that Sammy the “class clown” had been moved to when Mrs. Arlio was done with his disruptions. 

I smiled at the fond memories but staggered back as another wave of rot filled my nose. That’s when the walls started leaking water. It was like those old cartoons where a hole would appear and once you put your finger in it to stop it, another would appear just out of reach. Before I could even try to stop the water, flooded paper stuck to my legs in the rising tide. 

A spray of droplets cascaded onto my face and as I looked up the ceiling collapsed with a gush of water. That’s when I woke up. 

I was a little slow getting ready that morning which wasn’t uncommon for me who was dubbed “lazy bones” by mom just a year prior. Just as I sat for breakfast mom walked in with my bag. 

“My dream was odd…”
“Oh yeah? Tell me about it honey.”
Just as she said those words the squeal of bus tires penetrated the house as my sister Emma ran out the door. 
“Emmy you left your gym shoes, go on Porter get your stuff and go babe.”
She kissed my cheek as I rushed out the door grabbing Emmy’s things on my way. 

The whole day was uneventful and I spent most of the time dozing off, running in fields with Animus when I could. Someone grabbed my shoulder and I jumped 

“I know you have some medical stuff going on but try to stay awake for me, you can walk around if you need.” My English teacher was one of my most understanding of all my teachers but she did have to get me to do my book report after all. I had developed narcolepsy at a young age and I was constantly getting yelled at in school, still she didn’t fault me for it. 

I nodded and decided to stare out the window to try and stay awake, our school was on the same lot as the elementary school and you could see the other building from my classes. I looked on at the kids enjoying recess with envy. Sure I was in 7th grade and was certainly too old for it, I really missed recess. 

A loud thud echoed through the school and everyone panicked either crouching under the desks or trying to locate the source. Screams were heard from the elementary as people fled the building. Something was happening. After five or so minutes people stopped trickling out but it was nowhere near empty. Thank God someone pulled the fire alarm, that was all it took for the building to empty and the police get called. 
Rumors of school shooters and earthquakes spread like rapid fire.

We were all sent home early. I always sat near the back of the bus but today I ran straight to my sister’s seat and I’m not going to lie to you, I did cry when I found her safe. 

“Porter…” Emmy was crying as well and latched onto my shirt before I could sit down.

“I was in class… Mrs. Arlio’s class was next door and… the ceiling just fell.” She sobbed into my clothes. She wasn’t the only kid crying that day.

Normally this wouldn’t have been a big problem, but the elementary school was an old brick two story building. They didn’t stand a chance…

That’s when I started to put together maybe my dreams meant a little more than your average persons.
