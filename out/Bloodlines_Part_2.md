For weeks after the fire, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. The city buzzed around me, people rushing to work, horns blaring in traffic, but I was always looking over my shoulder. Every shadow seemed to stretch toward me, every whisper on the wind seemed to know my name.

I had nothing but the clothes I ran out with and a handful of cash I’d hidden in my room. It wasn’t much, but enough to rent a small, dingy apartment on the edge of town. The walls were thin, and the smell of mildew clung to the air. At night, I’d huddle under my blankets, clutching the dull knife I kept by my side for protection.

The nightmares started almost immediately.

In them, I was back in the Varner house. The flames were gone, replaced by the suffocating darkness of the basement. The altar loomed before me, the twisted symbols on the walls writhing like living things. Gloria and Harold were there, their eyes glassy, their smiles too wide, their voices chanting in a language I didn’t understand.

I’d wake up drenched in sweat, gasping for air. But the worst part wasn’t the dreams—it was the marks they left behind.

One morning, I found a thin, jagged scratch running down my arm. Another day, there was a bruise on my ankle, shaped like fingers. I told myself I must be thrashing in my sleep, hitting the edge of the bed or the nightstand. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t true.

Something was still with me.

One night, as I was coming home from my shift at a coffee shop, I found a package sitting outside my door. It was wrapped in plain brown paper, no return address. My name was scrawled across the top in familiar, spidery handwriting.

My hands shook as I carried it inside. I locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob, and sat at the kitchen table. For a long time, I just stared at the package, dread coiling in my stomach.

Finally, I opened it.

Inside was the red ribbon.

The same ribbon I’d found in the trunk, the one that had bound the letters about the blood debt. It was frayed and stained, but unmistakable. Beneath it was a small, leather-bound book.

I flipped through the pages, my breath catching in my throat. The book was a journal, filled with entries written in Gloria’s hand. The words revealed things I wish I could unlearn.

"The vessel resists. But the ritual will proceed as planned."

"It has been decades since the last blood moon. This time, we cannot fail."

"Her blood carries the key. Our survival depends on it."

The final entry was dated the day of the fire.

"Tonight, she will fulfill her purpose. The flames will not cleanse her. Blood binds, and blood always returns."

I slammed the book shut, my hands trembling. That’s when I noticed something else in the box: a photo.

It was an old black-and-white picture of a group of people standing outside a cabin. They were smiling, but their eyes were hollow, their faces unnerving in their stillness. And there, in the middle of the group, was me.

I stumbled back, my chair scraping against the floor. It couldn’t be me—it shouldn’t be me. The photo was decades old, the edges yellowed with time. But the girl in the picture was identical to me, down to the scar on my chin from when I fell off my bike as a kid.

I didn’t sleep that night.

The next morning, I decided to leave town. It didn’t matter where I went, as long as it was far away. I packed my things and headed for the bus station.

The streets were unusually quiet. No cars, no people, just an eerie stillness. It reminded me of the moments before a storm.

As I turned the corner, I saw them.

Gloria and Harold, standing across the street.

They looked the same as they had the night of the fire—unburned, unchanged. Harold smiled, raising a hand in a mock wave. Gloria tilted her head, her eyes locking onto mine.

I ran.

I didn’t stop until I reached the bus station, my chest heaving and legs burning. I bought a ticket for the next bus out, not caring where it was headed.

As the bus pulled out of the station, I pressed my forehead against the window, trying to catch my breath. That’s when I saw it again: the photo, tucked into the seat pocket in front of me.

The same photo of the cabin.

But this time, everyone in the picture was smiling directly at me.
