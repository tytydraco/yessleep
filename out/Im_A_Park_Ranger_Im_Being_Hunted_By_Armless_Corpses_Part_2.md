The sun rose up from the night sky, blessing the forest with the onset of dawn. The birds began chirping their routine ballads.   
The chirps were like white noise to me.   
I hacked at a branch that loomed over the trail with my machete. The branch snapped halfway and dangled at the side of the path.

  
I stared at the aftermath of my sloppy swing.   
Admittedly, I was still dazed by last night's events. I wasn't even sure if all of it was even real. If some muddy corpse was huddled in front of your doorstep, you'd at least expect to find a drop of blood.   
I scanned the entire staircase in the morning. To my absolute bewilderment, the staircase was spotless. Nothing made any sense. 

  
I stood there, staring at the branch. My mind was numb.   
  
"Beautiful day for a hike.", a voice came from behind me.   
I snapped out of my trance and spun around.  
A man was walking towards me. He had camping gear on him.   
"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you." He said as he extended his hand. "I'm Nico."   
  
I slowly shook his hand, trying to calm myself down.   
Nico spent the next 15 minutes striking conversation, telling me about his hiking trips and how it was his first time on this trail.   
He started asking me about camping spots.   
I gave him a look of confusion. This man wanted to pitch a tent for the night.   
Images of that disgusting corpse flashed through my mind. 

  
"You shouldn't camp here for the night.", I told him.   
"Excuse me?"   
"You shouldn't stay here after hours. The authorities have advised everyone to stay off the trails after 8:30 PM."   
I gave him the same warning officer Clark did. I figured that's the least I could correctly say.   
Nico was perplexed.   
"That's strange," he muttered. "The ranger I met earlier on this trail said there's a lovely campsite a mile down West." 

  
He pointed down the dirt path.   
Ranger? I thought to myself. Rob.   
Rob's tower was right before mine. This guy must've met Rob.   
That's when the realization struck me.

Rob didn't give this man any warnings.   
Nico knew nothing about the 8:30 curfew, the missing people, nothing.   
Were these people withholding information from the civilians too?   
"You sure you're a ranger, buddy?", Nico asked me as he started walking down the trail. "Either way, have a great day."   
He waved at me and disappeared into the trees.   
  
My head was spinning. As I walked up to my tower, I realized all of this was a huge cover up for something. I sat down at my desk. In front of me was my radio set, and my cell phone. The numbers 9-1-1 were dialed on the keypad. These were the only 2 contacts I could realistically reach from this forest reserve, and both of them were potentially hostile. The police won't help me or get me out of here because they're probably the ones running this whole operation. I thought of escaping from the confines of this park, but Rob and Martin's tower were between me and the park entrance. If I am intercepted by them, who knows what will happen to me. 

  
For now, I'm alive because I'm behaving myself. I figured my survival depends on my ability to keep up appearances and stay out of their way.   
What I didn't understand, however, was why cover up the deaths, especially from visitors?   
What could they possibly gain?   
  
I looked at the bookshelf beside my desk. I've been here for a month already and I never really bothered to open it. Today though, I felt the urge to open it.   
I opened it up. A sea of dust poured out of the wooden chamber. I covered my mouth, waiting for the dust to settle. 

  
There were quite a few books in there.   
Stuff from an atlas of America, to a field guide for birds and butterflies.   
I scanned all the 3 shelves.   
When I reached the bottom left corner, I noticed a few stray pages wedged between 2 books.   
I slowly retrieved the papers.

The paper looked like it was a year or so old.   
These were ruled pages, most likely taken from a diary.   
There were notes scribbled all over.   
On the first page was the title 'armless corpse murders'.  
My eyes widened as I read the contents of the page.   
  
2016   
  
Jean Pierre P. - October 13th - statement: animal attack   
  
Muhammad Abdul - October 16th - statement: animal attack  
  
There were names of people who died or went missing since 2016. The details included whether their body was found or not, whether the body had its arms missing, and the cause of death as stated by the officers. Every single case, in which the body was found, was labeled as an animal attack.   
  
Who wrote this? What was this doing in my tower?   
I speculated that the person working before me must've been secretly keeping notes, for the new guy that would succeed them. That new guy being me.   
  
I had a list of 7 years worth of murders in my hand. 7 entire years.   
I turned to the last page.   
On the bottom was a symbol. A lowercase i, with small lines radiating outward around it in a circle.   
I stared at the weird symbol. Then it hit me. That girl. The cuts on her corpse formed the same pattern.   
  
I got up and began locking all the windows. The door had a deadbolt. I had a feeling my survival through the night was going to depend on more than just a latch. 

  
I opted to skip my evening patrol in favor of reinforcing my fortress. I dragged the desk and pushed it against the door. That should provide some stopping power. I put duct tape on the window locks. That was probably a useless move but I was desperate. As the night creeped in, I crouched down on the floor next to my bed, with my machete firmly in my hand. 

  
A couple of hours went by. So far, nothing had approached my tower, or at least nothing I could hear. My angst was slowly dissipating.  
Maybe tonight wasn't going to be so bad.   
Then, all of a sudden, I noticed it. A peculiar feeling that was growing inside me. A guttural, primal sensation. I realized that I needed to take a piss.   
  
I stood up. The outhouse was on the ground, at the base of the tower.   
There was no chance in hell I was going to go down there this late.   
  
I looked at the window next to the door, and an idea struck me.   
  
I removed the duct tape and unlocked the window. Slowly, but surely, I thrust my hips outward and took aim. Once I was in a somewhat comfortable position, I let her rip.   
I stared into the dazzling night sky as my fountain glistened under the moonlight.   
I must say, the experience of unadulterated freedom was immaculate. 

  
I noticed a light fog off in the distance, deep into the forest reserve.   
I thought about it for a while. That fog was never not there. Every single day I've gazed upon this vast expanse, I've always seen it.   
  
I looked towards the ground below, near the trail.   
The pressure of the stream slowly began to subside. It waned and waned until I felt the clutches of my own fear hold my piss in.   
  
She's there. Standing at the edge of the treeline. That dead girl is back. She's staring at me with those lifeless eyes.   
I took a step back. The girl didn't break eye contact. I noticed movement in the treeline. 2 dark figures were approaching the treeline.   
They trudged on, slouching, and stepped foot into the moonlight. They were 2 men. But they looked battered and bruised. Neither of them had arms. I took a closer look at their faces. They seemed familiar. 

  
I remembered the missing posters 2 weeks ago.   
These were the hikers that went missing before the incident with the girl. All 3 of these people are supposed to be dead. 

  
A cold sweat dripped down my forehead.   
The girl took a step forward. This night had just begun. I pulled my hips in and slammed the window shut. The duct tape. It was on the desk. I grabbed the tape and ran back to the window.   
The 3 undead corpses were still at the treeline. I froze. They were staring at me. Suddenly, they started running to the tower in unison. 

The little girl jumped 5 feet into the air and landed on one of the stilts of the tower. I looked down. The girl was gripping the wooden pole with her mouth and legs.   
I heard the sound of scraping, as gravity pulled her body back to the ground, dragging her teeth along the wood. 

  
The other 2 were quick to follow suit. All 3 undead jumped at the stilts, trying to climb them like inchworms.   
The frantic squirms of the armless corpses as they bit down and dragged their teeth up the height of the stilt were horrifying.   
Streaks of blood stained the wood of the tower.   
The corpses were relentless. Stopping at nothing, not even the mutilation of their own jaws, to get to me. 

  
They were almost at the top.   
I snapped back to my senses.  
I doubled down on the duct tape for each lock.   
The window at the back of the tower was the only one left to tape down a second time.   
I grabbed the tape and faced the glass. 

  
There, right on the other side, was a dead hiker's disfigured mouth. Teeth jutted out of his gums and lips. His front teeth were either missing or bent at extreme angles. He probably couldn't even close his mouth properly.   
His body violently twitched, desperately trying to stand up on the edge of the planks.   
  
In a panic, I ran to the radio set. I desperately tried to reach either Rob or Martin. I picked up the box.   
"Hello. Hello, is anyone there?"   
I cried into the microphone.   
"Please, Martin, Rob. Please respond." 

  
I heard static. I stopped talking, and listened closely. All of a sudden, a loud screaming erupted from the radio. It was a little girl's scream. My blood ran cold. Instinctively, I dropped the radio on the floor and crawled to my bed. A man's screams joined the little girl, as a cacophony of pain filled the cabin.   
Before I could even react, I heard loud bangs on the windows. They were trying to break in.   
Something began smashing the door in. 

  
Luckily, the desk was holding.   
The banging on the windows grew more aggressive. I wasn't sure how long the glass would hold.   
I grabbed the machete on the bed and held it close to my chest. The banging and screaming kept growing and growing in intensity. I could feel my soul shake.   
I closed my eyes.

  
Silence. Everything just stopped.   
I looked around at the windows.   
What the hell just happened?  
  
I gave it a minute. I still didn't feel like risking it. Still nothing.   
Did they give up?  
I slowly stood up. The cabin was desolate.   
I approached the window next to the door.   
The 3 corpses were standing at the treeline again. But this time, they were facing away from me, into the forest. 

  
I lowered myself a bit, afraid of being noticed.   
There was a 4th person there.   
Something was different however. This one had hands. I looked at the person's face. Nico. It was the dude I met on my morning patrol. He was walking into the forest. 

  
No. Something was holding his hand. An arm. An arm was extended out from the darkness of the forest. He was being led into the woods by someone. I couldn't see the person who was taking Nico into the woods by hand. But the arm, it was so slender and lanky. It was pale and clammy looking.   
It looked more like a stage prop.   
I wanted to call out to Nico and stop him.   
But I couldn't. I was frozen over in fear. All I could do was watch the long, pale arm lead Nico into the dark forest. 

  
I stared at the black void behind the trees. All of a sudden, another arm reached out from the darkness. This time, the arm was pointed at me. My eyes widened.   
The 3 corpses turned to stare at me.   
The arm slowly flipped upright. The bony finger now slowly curled backwards. It was beckoning me to come. 

  
I didn't move. I couldn't.   
The arm slowly retreated into the darkness, slithering away like a snake.   
And with it, the corpses followed.   
  
My eyes were glued to the trail.   
I stood in front of the window.   
One hour. 2 hours. 3 hours. I don't know how long I stood there.   
All I know is that the sound of my radio snapped me out of my trance. 

  
I picked up the radio and sat on my bed. The sun rose above the horizon once again, and with it came the worst announcement of my life. 

  
"We've received a missing person's case on \[REDACTED\] trail. All on-site park staff are required to participate in the search group today at 7:30 AM. Please be present half an hour early for the briefing."
