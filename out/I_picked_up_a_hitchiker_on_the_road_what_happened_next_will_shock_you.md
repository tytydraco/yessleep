 It was a dark and stormy night, the kind of night that gives you the creeps. I was driving down an old dirt road in the middle of nowhere, trying to get to my friend's house for a party. The rain was coming down in sheets, and I could barely see the road in front of me.

Just as I was starting to regret leaving the comfort of my warm bed, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a hitchhiker, holding a sign that read "Anywhere But Here."

I've always been a sucker for a good Samaritan story, so I decided to stop and give the poor guy a lift. As he got in the car, I noticed something strange about him. He was wearing a creepy mask, and his eyes seemed to follow me wherever I went.

"Where are you headed?" I asked, trying to break the awkward silence.

"Anywhere but here," he replied in a low, menacing voice.

I started to feel a little uneasy, but I figured I was just being paranoid. After all, it was Halloween night, and people were probably just trying to scare each other.

As we drove, the hitchhiker kept making strange noises, and his mask seemed to be getting tighter and tighter. Suddenly, he reached out and grabbed my arm.

"You'll never leave this road alive," he growled.

I slammed on the brakes and tried to get out of the car, but the doors were locked. I was trapped with this crazy hitchhiker, and I had no idea what to do.

Suddenly, the hitchhiker's mask fell off, revealing my friend Steve underneath. He started laughing hysterically and said, "Gotcha!"

I was relieved and angry at the same time. "That wasn't funny, Steve," I said, still shaking from the scare.

"I know, I'm sorry," he replied. "I just wanted to prank you for Halloween."

We finally made it to Steve's house, and the party was in full swing. There were people in costumes, scary decorations, and spooky music. I started to relax and enjoy myself, forgetting all about the hitchhiker incident.

That is, until I saw something moving in the shadows. It was a figure dressed in black, with a hood over its head. It was slowly making its way towards me, and I could hear its breathing getting louder and louder.

I froze, not knowing what to do. The figure was getting closer and closer, and I could feel its breath on my neck. I turned around, ready to face my fear head-on, and came face to face with a giant spider.

I screamed and jumped back, knocking over a table of snacks. Everyone at the party started laughing, and I realized that the spider was just another prank.

I decided to get my revenge on Steve and came up with a plan. I went to the bathroom and put on a creepy clown costume I had found earlier. Then, I snuck up behind Steve and tapped him on the shoulder.

He turned around, and I could see the fear in his eyes. "Who are you?" he asked, trembling.

"I'm your worst nightmare," I replied, and chased him around the party, making him scream like a little girl.

In the end, we all had a good laugh and enjoyed the rest of the party. The hitchhiker, the spider, and the clown had all been pranks, and we had all survived Halloween night. As I drove home, I couldn't help but smile at the thought of all the hilarious scares we had pulled off that night.
