I still have a weird headache. It’s strangely on the top of my head. 

I can’t stop thinking about it her though. Every time I close my eyes to sleep I dream about the scene vividly. 

Here’s how the rest goes. 

As the docent told us about it, my classmates were busy deciding who they’d sacrifice to go in but I volunteered willingly. I wasn’t afraid of it, in fact I didn’t believe my classmates and figured there was some elaborate jumpscares set up by the museum since the docent was so agreeable. 

She lead us all in to the spooky dim-lit room where in front of a covered window was a real looker of a wax stature. It was a spider woman, obese and wearing a culturally offensive travelers outfit. She sat in front of a crystal ball on a table, two of her many flabby-skinned and wrinkled arms over the ball. She had a sinister smirk on her face, many eyes set into it that seemed to look at every one present. 

Unlike other wax sculptures, her skin did not appear smooth. Even the folds of her stomach, thighs which were folded criss-cross applesauce style, and her hanging arm skin were dry and consumed with an impossible amount of tinkles. She had liver spots on her hand, her exposed chest as droopy and speckled with sunspots, and her lips were dry and crusty. She had sickeningly long nails, thick like claws and painted a gaudy red. After about two minutes and some scolding from the docent not to touch the sculptures as some pervy boys chatted about touching the “spider boobs”, she ushered us out of the room. 

I stayed back though, ready to fulfill my mission. I stayed quiet and when everyone left I tucked myself behind the wall so no one would catch me while descending the stairs case. Once the footsteps stopped on the steps, I headed back over to the statute. She was marvelous, taller than me so she had to be at least near 6ft sitting. 

I stared into her eyes, the ones that were where a normal humans would be. I held my flip phone in my hand and noted the time before going back to staring. I started to count to 700, silently noting the details of her glossy glass eyes. They had so much detail, brown with flecks of vibrant green, gold, and brown-red. They were so glossy like they were sitting in liquid, like when you look into your grandmas eyes. I was completely lost in them, forgetting the details of the room or the space and hardly noticing that the door was slowly closing other than the creak which seemed somehow distant. 

Suddenly I was brought out of the strange trance when I heard my full name being called. I blinked my eyes and stepped back, realizing I was only inches from touching one of her held out hands. My teacher was in the door way, saying my name in a scolding tone as I looked up at her. She ushered me out, scolding me the whole time and I was quiet until she left me with my shocked looking classmates. 

When the cost was clear, everyone began to question me. They said I was there for at least an hour, but we were kids so I’d probably say it was more like 20 minutes which is still too long if you ask me. I don’t know but I have this vague feeling like she was moving her arms, when I think back I don’t remember looking back as I was leaving but I have a strange feeling I can’t explain. Something in me feels like I did and I saw her head turned towards me and an arm outstretched to grab where my head would have been had I still been stranding close to her. 

I think that teacher unknowingly saved my life. 

Does anyone have any memory of this place? 

I remember it was a traveling exhibit so it’s possible others in other states might have seen it too. 

I just can’t shake it, this feeling, I have to know it was real and not just a hallucinations or a dream. 

I know it was real. It has to be.
