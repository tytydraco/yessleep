It wasn’t over.

I thought it would be—the whispers, the unease, the oppressive silence. I’d locked myself in the basement for days after that night, eyes glued to the floor, refusing to look at the sliver of light that crept through the cracks. No one knocked on my door, no one called. It was like the world outside had… paused.

Until tonight.

I couldn’t take the isolation anymore. The moon couldn’t be following me, could it? That was just paranoia talking, the remnants of a fevered mind. I needed air. I needed to know.

I stepped outside into the cool night, the quiet hum of the streetlights doing little to ease my nerves. My neighbors’ houses were dark, the sidewalks eerily empty. The wind carried a faint, familiar hum that I tried to ignore.

The moon wasn’t visible at first. Good. Maybe I was safe. But as I walked, the hair on my neck stood on end, that primal instinct screaming at me to stop.

And then I saw it.

Not in the sky. Not far away.

The moon was on the horizon, hovering low like a giant unblinking eye staring directly at me. It wasn’t the pale, serene moon I remembered. It was wrong—yellowed and cracked, with dark, twisting veins pulsing beneath its surface. And it was closer now.

Much closer.

I stumbled back, my breath hitching. The hum grew louder, vibrating in my skull. There was a shadow beneath it, shifting unnaturally, moving as though it were alive. The shadow stretched and bent, spilling across the ground like a liquid, flowing toward me.

I ran.

I don’t remember when my legs started moving. All I knew was that I couldn’t stop, couldn’t look back. The streets twisted in impossible ways, every turn leading me back to the same desolate road. The moon loomed overhead now, impossibly large, its cracked surface glowing faintly.

The whispers started again, faint at first, like voices carried on the wind. They grew louder as I stumbled forward, clutching at my ears.

“You shouldn’t have looked.”

“We warned you.”

“It sees you now.”

I stopped in the middle of the street, gasping for air, and screamed at the top of my lungs. “What do you want from me?”

The whispers stopped.

The moon pulsed, a ripple of light cascading across its surface. And then it spoke.

Not in words, but in my mind, cutting through my thoughts like a blade.

“Come closer.”

My legs moved on their own, dragging me forward, toward the glowing shadow beneath it. I fought against it, clawing at the ground, but the pull was too strong. The shadow reached out, curling around my feet, my legs, pulling me into its inky embrace.

Before I disappeared into the darkness, I saw something.

A figure.

Standing in the distance, shrouded in shadow but unmistakably human. They weren’t running. They weren’t hiding. They just stood there, staring at the moon, their silhouette sharp against its unnatural glow.

The whispers returned, different now, more frantic.

“Not him.”

“He remembers.”

“He knows.”

The figure turned, and even though I couldn’t see his face, I felt his gaze pierce through me. A faint smirk tugged at his lips before he raised a hand, pointing directly at me.

Then everything went black.
