[Things got a bit hairy on our shift](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/6Ac3wyUpZq)

I’ve had stitches when I was younger, and I still remember how careful I had to be while they healed. The experience taught me a lot about following instructions and being patient during recovery. Daren got some time off from work after the mustache fiasco, Mary didn’t believe the story I told the cops about a “shelf” falling on Daren. 

Mary told me she tried to check the security footage of the store, but conveniently the security cameras glitched out so there was no recording of what really happened. That only made the whole situation even more suspicious, especially since Mary is rarely convinced by my explanations—when it comes to weird things at night. I, of course, was relieved that there is no proof to disprove my claims to the cops. 

Turns out, Daren ended up with twelve stitches on his forehead, a concussion, and a dislocated shoulder. I’m surprised, that man wasn’t hurt even worse, well given he is just a twig. He won’t be returning to work for a few days probably and probably won’t intervene with the paranormal or mustache’s anytime soon. 

While speaking with Mary in her office, she included Daren on speakerphone to discuss our accounts. Daren stated that he had temporary memory loss as a result of his concussion, although I know he remembers the whole incident. 

So, I guess I’ve still got a coworker working with me on the overnight shift, he’s just taking a mini medical vacation at the moment. 

So, while he’s out, I get to go back to be alone again and figure out what I’m going to do with the mustache in the jar. 

Honestly, I don’t know what to do with it, although it is entertaining when I shake the jar, and the sentient facial hair, quivers and twirls and slams against the glass jar wall. Have you ever trapped a bug in a jar and had the urge to shake it? That’s how this feels, like I’m holding onto something a little wild and unpredictable, not quite sure what will happen if I poke at it too much. The mustache sits there, sealed in its glass prison, and it’s almost tempting to see if prodding it will cause some reaction, even though I know better than to actually try.

Working on the overnight shift, you learn a few things NOT to do, like Daren for example, don’t intervene in the paranormal. You get twelve stitches, a concussion and a dislocated shoulder. Of course, I was going to rub it in his face when he comes back, despite Daren’s can-do attitude, I actually like the guy. He’s not half bad for being inexperienced with the paranormal. 

It sucked I had to come in so early before my shift to talk to Mary about the incident, during the day, the gas station really does look like a forgotten relic on the edge of nowhere, but when the sun goes down. Its flickering sign casting epileptic shadows across the cracked asphalt, the numbers on the sign of gas prices flickers like a warning sign. As I got off my bus and walked towards the parking lot sipping lukewarm coffee and muttering curses at the moths dive-bombing me. 

The moment I opened the door and stepped inside of the gas station, the smell of it clings on to you like a parasite, I’ve washed my clothes so many times, no amount of showers gets rid of that smell. Like scorched popcorn and existential dread. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like the angry hornets’ nest that hangs above pump eight like a red flag. Coming back was a pain in the ass from early this afternoon; I clocked in at 9:59 PM— one minute early. Usually, I’m ten minutes late. 

I relieved Scott, who was practically already running out the door, without a goodbye, apparently, he’s got some gaming session to play with his friends. Knowing him, it’s probably in the basement of his mom’s house. No one has discovered the Mustache yet, I kept him hidden in one of the junk drawers no one looks in, if Mary noticed the tip jar missing, she didn’t comment about it. 

I started my usual routine, noticing Tommi didn’t come in to be a nuisance, he did text me and say that there was a festival tonight and he’d be far too busy to grace me with his presence, I didn’t mind. I checked the cooler for expired milk—the freezer ghost adamantly was slamming against the door. Restocked the gum rack—found a green glowing German roach. And wiped down the counter with a rag that smelled suspiciously like gasoline. I had one earbud in my ear; my playlist was something all alternative people could appreciate. 

About 2:17 AM, The bell sounded across the store,  I was in the middle of trying to make the slushie machine work, it’s usually the cherry that stops working and oozes out from the top. A man entered, not anyone I’d seen before, he wore a coat that looked like it had been stitched together by different fabrics. He didn’t speak. He didn’t blink. He carried an old, weaved picnic basket in one arm. 

There was something unsettling about the way he moved—deliberate, without a hint of hesitation, as if he’d rehearsed every step before even entering the store. I paused, trying to gauge if he was just another lost drifter that came down from the mountain or if he belonged to the category of oddities that seemed drawn to this place after midnight. 

The hum of the fluorescent lights suddenly felt louder, and for a moment, even the mustache in the jar seemed to sense something was off, twitching against the glass as if in warning (I kept the mustache on the counter during my shift). 

I watched him walk up the aisles as if he was looking for something. The way he moved and turned his entire body when he wanted to look at something didn’t feel right. 

I set the slushie cup down, wiping my hands on my jeans, my eyes fixed on the stranger as he made his way past the aisles with barely a glance at the merchandise. Every step echoed on the chipped linoleum, each movement sending a jolt of unease up my spine. The mustache rattled its jar again, almost frantic now, and I resisted the urge to slide it out of sight. somehow, I had the feeling that nothing in this store could really be hidden once you enter.

The knocking in the freezer stopped, the ticking of the clock on the wall did too, everything felt still. Like the store was holding its breath. I walked over the cash wrap and walked behind the counter and stood at the register, watching the man silently. 

He finally approached the counter and set the weaved old picnic basket down with an unnerving gentleness, its surface frayed and faded with age. The handle creaked as he released it, and for a moment, he simply stood there, staring straight ahead while the basket seemed almost out of place against the battered counter. I swallowed; my hand unconsciously tightened around the rag, waiting for him to say or do something or anything to break the silence that pressed down like a heavy blanket.

So, I broke the silence, “hi, did you find everything you were looking for?” trying my inner Daren customer service voice. 

“Matches.” That was all he grunted out, his voice rough and gravelly, as if the single word cost him more effort than it should have. I blinked, trying to read his expression, but his eyes remained fixed somewhere behind me, unfocused and distant.

Normal gas stations don’t have matches, but Mary was old school and carried them. So, I pulled out a pack for him and rang him up. “That’s going to be $3.08, I also need to see your I.D. before you pay this, it’s the rules and all.” 

He slid the card across the counter, his movements slow and deliberate, never breaking eye contact with some invisible spot over my shoulder. I glanced at the name, trying not to let my expression betray any hint of recognition or concern. It was a woman’s I.D. and I quickly realized I’d better pretend this was his. The air felt charged, like a storm looming just outside the flickering glass doors.

“Will that be cash or card, sir?”

He held up a plastic card, with blood on it, and a woman's name glinted in the fluorescent lighting. I don't get paid enough to ask. I kept my face neutral, swiped the card, and tried not to dwell on the metallic tang that lingered in the air. The register beeped, and for a moment, I wondered if it would refuse the transaction on principle, but it spat out a receipt as if nothing at all was amiss.

He reached for the matches and left the store. He left the weaved picnic basket on my counter, its faded pattern suddenly looking more sinister beneath the harsh fluorescent lights. I tried to yell after him that he’d forgotten his basket, my voice echoing through the silent aisles, but he was gone, just vanished into the night, leaving only the lingering chill in the air and the strange, uneasy quiet that seemed to press closer with every second.

I’m not touching that basket, so I grabbed a pen to push it to the side and something inside shifted. A faint, muffled clink echoed from within, like glass tapping against metal, and I froze, the pen poised midair. 

For a heartbeat, I was certain the basket itself was breathing, its weave tightening and loosening with some hidden pulse, until the sensation passed, leaving only my own rapid heartbeat drumming in my ears.

“Nope,” I said dropping the pen. I looked over at the mustache in the jar, “I was stupid enough to tango with you, not going to mess with a haunted hamper.” 

I grabbed the Windex and sprayed it with good measure, the basket stopped breathing, I’d learned that for some reason most supernatural things in this store are repelled by Windex, or at least this kind. But I have a working theory the Windex Mary buys isn’t actually Windex. 

It smells sharper, more like ozone and lavender than actual glass cleaner, and it leaves behind a faint shimmer on anything it touches. I’ve stopped questioning it. I just keep extra bottles beneath the counter, replenishing my stash whenever Mary restocks. Some nights, when the store feels especially restless, I spritz a little into the corners and watch the shadows recoil, huddling away from the gleam.

When I was sure nothing was going to pop out of the basket like a jack-in-the-box, I went back to working on unclogging the slushie machine. My hands shook just a little as I pulled out the sticky tray, half expecting to find something lurking beneath the grape syrup. It was quiet, almost too quiet. except for the hum of the cooler and the occasional drip from the busted ceiling tile.

I turned around with the tray and nearly dropped it when I saw the weaved basket on the table behind me. I could have sworn I'd pushed it far out of sight, yet there it sat, somehow closer than before, its faded colors looking even more warped under the harsh overhead lights. For a moment, I just stared, unsure whether to run or grab the Windex again.

“This is how the blondes die in horror movies, there is no way I’m going to open that thing,” I said more to myself than anything. 

But the basket just sat there, indifferent to my refusal, its shadow stretching out across the linoleum like a warning. I edged around it, keeping one wary eye on the weave as I dumped the slushie tray in the sink. Behind me, the basket gave another faint clink, almost as if something inside had shifted again or was trying to get out. I shivered and glanced at the clock, silently willing the next customer to walk in and break the tension.

When I turned back around to replace the tray at the slushie machine this time, I tripped over the weaved basket. It scraped across the linoleum with a hollow thud, sending a jolt of panic up my spine as my foot tangled in its faded handle. As I stumbled forward, instantly, I was somewhere else. 

I was no longer in the gas station but at a familiar park I used to go to when I was a kid. The air felt warmer here, thick with the scent of cut grass and sun-warmed earth, and the distant laughter of children echoed from across a playground I remembered like a dream. I was surrounded by towering oaks and the faded green of the old swing set, as if the years had folded in on themselves and brought me back to a moment, I thought I’d left behind.

“Mommy!” I heard the faint cry of a young girl from afar; excitement was laced in her tone. I walked around one of the oak trees, to see a mother and daughter having a picnic, with that same old weaved picnic basket that was in the gas station. 

The memory hit me hard, I remember this, it was my sixth birthday, and the park seemed bigger back then, every corner bursting with possibility. My mom set up a picnic beneath the oaks, balloons bobbing in the gentle breeze, and I wore a paper crown that kept slipping sideways on my head. I could almost taste the sweetness of melted ice cream and hear the crinkling of wrapping paper as I tore into my presents, it was just the two of us.

But the sky was wrong, the sun flickered like a dying bulb and my mom’s face was blurred, as though I was peering at her through warped glass. The colors around me seemed slightly off, too vivid at the edges and strangely washed out everywhere else, making everything feel both familiar and unsettling at the same time. I tried to focus, to latch onto a detail that felt real, but the scene wavered with each breath, as if I were standing in the middle of a memory that didn’t entirely belong to me.

I shook my head and glanced around, *this* wasn’t how it happened. My memories felt slightly jumbled, but I distinctively remembered that my mom gave me presents, she got up telling me she was going to go to the bathroom but never came back. 

When I turned back toward the picnic, my six-year-old self was standing all alone, gazing at me with an intensity that sent a chill through me. There was something unsettling in her stare like something darker lurking behind those wide eyes, a shadow of malice that hadn’t been there in my memories. The paper crown wobbled on her brow, but her lips curled into a strange, knowing smirk that made the sun seem to flicker even more violently overhead.

“ARLEN!” 

Tommi’s voice pulled me out of the weird dream, jolting me back to the harsh glare of the gas station’s fluorescent lights. I blinked, disoriented, realizing I was sitting on the cold linoleum floor with Tommi crouching beside me, his brows knit in worry as he asked if I was okay. The sounds of the station, the hum of the fridge, the distant ring of the cash register, slowly filtered back in, grounding me in the present as I tried to make sense of what had just happened.

“Are you okay?” he asked softly. 

I swallowed, the taste of memory lingering thick at the back of my throat. For a moment, I couldn’t find my voice, haunted by the vividness of a place that was gone yet somehow still part of me. I nodded slowly and tried to steady my breathing, the echo of that strange vision still reverberating in my head. “Yeah,” I managed finally, my voice shaky but determined. “I just got a little lightheaded, I guess. Must’ve tripped.”

He helped me on my feet to a chair; he grabbed one of the plastic cups and filled the fountain plastic cup with water and held it out to me. “Are you sure you’re, okay?”

I took the cup, my hands trembling slightly as I sipped the cold water. It felt almost unreal, how a simple taste grounded me, pulling me back from the edges of that disjointed memory. Tommi watched me, concern etched deep in his face, and I forced a small, reassuring smile. “I’m really okay. It just… all hit me at once.” Even as I spoke, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something from that memory was lingering, just out of sight, waiting for another chance to surface.

I don’t know exactly what happened, it was like I was transported through time, but in a different distorted place, it felt more like a messed-up nightmare than anything else. I gingerly sipped the water as I flicked my eyes back up at him, his brows furrowed and his sharp intelligent eyes stared down at me with concern. 

I tried to laugh it off, “it’s nothing, nothing happened, maybe it’s because I haven’t eaten anything at all.” I took another ginger sip. “I thought you were busy with the festival at your tattoo shop.” 

Tommi shrugged, still looking uneasy. “Yeah, I was, it ended hours ago. You didn’t answer your phone.” His voice was gentle, but there was an edge underneath, like he was second-guessing whether to push further. “You know you can tell me if something’s wrong, right?” He leaned forward a bit, resting his palm on the table. 

I blinked, “hours ago?” I was baffled. I pulled my phone out of my pocket to see my shift was going to end in an hour. “It didn’t feel like it was that long . . .” I muttered to myself. 

My mind raced, grasping for a sensible explanation as I stared at the flickering phone screen, its blue light feeling almost foreign in my hand. The minutes felt stretched and bent, as if the world had skipped ahead without me. 

I looked up at Tommi, swallowed again, and tried to shake off the lingering haze. “Honestly, it just feels like I blinked and missed a chunk of time,” I admitted, the words sounding strange even to myself. The faint hum of anxiety buzzed beneath my skin, urging me to stay alert, to search for clues in the ordinary.

“Time is actually irrelevant, but here it matters I suppose,” his voice sounded far, as if he instantly was across the store. When I looked up from my cup, he was gone. I was alone in the gas station again. 

“Tommi?”

My breath caught in my chest. The sudden emptiness pressed in, thick and strange, and for a heartbeat I wondered if he'd ever really been there at all. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, their hum growing louder in the silence, making the whole world feel artificial, as if I’d slipped out of reality and into some hollow echo of it.

I stood up quickly and set the cup on the table and walked around the cash wrap to find the weaved basket still where I’d left it. Untouched, withered, unmoving, I glanced at where the mustache in the jar I left, but it wasn’t there. Slowly looking out the front windows, it was inky blackness outside, no lights, no pumps, no sweeper. It was like the gas station was swallowed by a blackhole. 

My heart pounded as I stepped closer to the windows, straining to see any hint of life beyond the glass. Even the familiar neon sign above the door seemed to have vanished, swallowed by the dense, suffocating dark. 

For a moment, I wondered if I was dreaming, locked in some strange liminal space between memory and reality, where every ordinary detail turned uncanny. I hesitated, the silence pressing in on me, unsure whether to call out again or just listen for any sign that I wasn't truly alone.

“Arlen, wake up!” Tommi’s voice filled my ears, and I gasped awake, heart still hammering in my chest. The fluorescent lights snapped sharply back into focus, as I looked up from my head, laying in the crook of my elbow, hunched over the table as if I had fallen asleep. “You must have fallen asleep while working last night.” 

I glanced up at Tommi and squinted my eyes up at him, “are you real?” 

He gave a short, almost sheepish laugh. “Last time I checked, I was pretty real.” The way his eyes searched my face made it clear he was trying to read my mood, to reassure me, or maybe himself, that everything was normal again. 

The world felt shaky under me, reality stitched together by thin threads. For a moment, I just listened to the familiar hum of the lights and the distant whir of the cooler, grounding myself in the small, ordinary sounds.

“You couldn’t come in because you were too busy at your shop,” the words felt hollow in my throat, a repeated conversation I had with him. 

He leaned in closer, his tone sharper and more urgent than before. “I told you time is irrelevant here, but seriously, wake up or you might not ever. Just open your palm, you’ll see I’m right.” His words hung in the air, heavy with warning and a strange certainty, making me hesitate before glancing down at my hand.

I didn’t see anything in my hand at first, just the faded lines of my palmbut I did as he said. I opened it anyway. In an instant, the world shifted around me, and suddenly I was standing behind the register, the pen slipping from my grasp and clattering onto the counter as I realized I’d just used it to push the basket away. 

For a split second, everything felt both familiar and impossibly strange, as if the mundane act of dropping the pen had snapped me back into reality, I wasn’t sure was truly mine.

I glanced out the window, there the floodlights at the pumps flickered normally, Sweeper was sweeping around pump four as if it was a regular Sunday. I choked, a breathless laugh escaping me as the tension in my chest eased, just a little. It was all back again—the harsh glare of the lights, the hum of the refrigerator, the ordinary sounds that proved I hadn't drifted too far from the world I knew. 

There was honestly something about that basket, I opened and closed my hand. When the door dinged, I looked up to see Tommi walking through the door in his usual leather jacket, and smudged ink on his jaw and neck and hands. “Please tell me this is real. I’m not dreaming right now, right?” my eyes weld up with tears. 

He seemed confused and nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’m just stopping in to grab some energy drinks before I have to deal with all the drunk people from the festival downtown,” he said, his voice carrying the tired resignation of someone already bracing for a long night. The familiar way he spoke-half exasperated, half amused—helped steady me, anchoring the moment in something real and ordinary.

“Oh, thank god, I’m back.” I said relieved. 

He laughed, shaking his head. “If you weren’t working, Arlen, where else would you be, at some secret beach getaway? Or maybe finally catching up on sleep?” His sarcasm cut through the haze, bringing a hint of normalcy back to the conversation. He walked towards the cooler doors towards the energy drinks. 

I glared at the basket, “I wish, I dozed off and had a bizarre dream and kept waking up in the gas station and you kept waking me up.” 

He had a strange smile, one that twisted at the corner of his mouth as he grabbed several cans from the shelf. “That sounds like one hell of a bizarre dream,” he replied, eyebrows raised with genuine curiosity. “What happened in it? Did I actually manage to wake you up, or was I just a figment?”

I paused, honestly, I didn’t know. “Well, I’m awake,” I said softly, it was almost a prayer, I hoped I was awake this time. because if the basket was messing with me again, I swear I was going to light it on fire. “You kept saying time was irrelevant.” 

He slowly walked up the aisle with cans of energy drinks, tossing them lightly from hand to hand. “Depends where and who you talk to,” he said, his voice echoing in the quiet of the store. He looked at me with a crooked grin, then added, “Some people swear time’s a loop, others think it’s just a line we’re all stuck on. Guess it’s all about perspective.” The way he said it made the ordinary person feel mysterious again, and for a moment, I found myself listening to that strange shift in reality, just in case.

I nodded, “what do you think?” 

He walked up to the counter and sat the energy drink cans down on the counter and glanced at the weaved picnic basket. He hesitated, weighing the question as if it deserved more than a casual answer. 

“I don’t know,” he admitted after a moment. “Sometimes it feels like everything repeats, like we’re stuck on the same track. Other times, it’s like things only move forward, leaving us scrambling to keep up.” He shrugged, the movement almost apologetic, and looked away, thoughtful. “Maybe it’s both. Maybe time bends around us without us noticing.”

I started scanning the barcodes on the energy drinks, “you sound like an old man, is that what you really think, Mr. Philosopher?” 

He shrugged, grinning a little. “Hey, someone’s got to balance out all those energy drinks with some wisdom, right?” The lightness in his voice didn’t quite mask the seriousness beneath, and for a heartbeat, I wondered if he was actually onto something. “Maybe we just notice time more when it gets weird,” he continued, his gaze flicking from the basket to me, “like moments that don’t fit, or dreams that bleed into real life.” It was a thought that lingered, unsettling and oddly comforting at the same time.

“I suppose so,” I said softly. “Cash or card?” 

He slid a crumpled bill from his pocket, handing it to me with a thoughtful look. “Cash today. Figure I’ll keep it simple.” He waited for me to give his change, still glancing at the basket as if it might start moving on its own. “You know sometimes I think we’re all just trying to find the edge of the dream. Maybe real life is just the part where we remember to pay for the energy drinks.” He gave a small laugh, then paused, watching me for a reaction. “Or maybe we’re still dreaming, and this is just another layer. Either way, I’m glad you’re awake for now.”

I handed him his change, and he reached out and curled his fingers into a fist and knocked on top of the basket lid. “What are you doing?!” I panicked from my earlier experience. 

But nothing happened. He just shrugged, unfazed, and continued talking as if my outburst hadn't startled him at all. “Relax,” he said, voice low and easy, “sometimes you just have to knock to see if the dream bites back. Usually, it doesn't.” He gave me a reassuring grin, then leaned casually against the counter, waiting for my nerves to settle.

“That doesn’t make sense, why knock?” I asked wondering what happened to me was just in my head. 

He tilted his head, considering. “Maybe it’s just habit, or superstition. You know, like knocking on wood for luck, or maybe it’s a way to check if something’s really there, if anything responds. It doesn’t have to make sense. Sometimes rituals are just how we keep ourselves anchored, even if we don’t remember why we started them.” He watched my face, a hint of amusement flickering in his eyes, and then added quietly, “Sometimes, asking why part is of waking up, too.”

He gathered his energy drinks and left telling me to have a good night. His words echoed in my mind, mingling with the half-remembered fragments of morning dreams and the faint hum. There was something oddly comforting in the way he spoke about rituals, as if every small gesture like knocking on basket lids, paying with cash had held its own secret logic, a thread tying us to reality even when it seemed thin. I found myself nodding, unsure if I agreed or simply wanted to believe in the sense behind it all.

I reached out and knocked on the lid of the basket. 

The clanking sound came back, and the basket moved, just a little, enough to make me freeze and stare. My breath caught as I watched it shift, the faint echo of metal on metal reminding me that maybe dreams did bite back after all. Suddenly, I wasn't sure which layer I was in, and the fluorescent lights seemed to hum a little louder.

Heart pounding, I hesitated, half expecting the basket to leap or whisper some secret only dreams could carry. But after that brief, uncanny movement, everything went still. The quiet stretched, charged with possibility, and I found myself listening for any sign that reality had shifted and wondering if I had crossed some invisible threshold, or if the world was simply holding its breath with me.

Then I heard the familiar knocking from the freezer door, and jolted, shouting, “Enough already, freezer ghost!” My voice echoed back at me, rattling alongside the knock, making the moment feel both ridiculous and real. For a second, I half-expected an answer from behind the frosted glass, but the store just settled into its usual silence, the only reply the low, steady hum of the coolers. 

I suppose I’m back in reality now, well I hope so. . . . .
