“Thank you for meeting with us Mr & Mrs Hart, and Jonathon we look forward to seeing you tomorrow for your first day of classes here at Oakwood Academy.” The head teacher said, as she shook my parents hands. My parents exchanged pleasantries, before we let ourselves out and left the school gates.

“See, that wasn’t so bad now was it Jonny?” My mum said as she pulled me in for a hug, in an attempt to cheer me up.

“I guess.” I nonchalantly replied, walking alongside them.

“I’m just glad we found such a school near our new home.” My dad said with a chuckle as he ruffled my hair a little.

I suppose I should give some backstory, although I assure you there isn’t much interesting to tell. There’s no big secret or mystery behind my family packing up and moving up to another side of England for anyone reading this to enquire about, my Dad simply got a promotion at work, nothing special. 

He asked me of course, but it seemed I didn’t have much of a choice so I more or less said my goodbyes to my friends with the promise of keeping in touch and now…we’ll I’m here. Oh and don’t get too excited,

But that’s the past, and now I’m here at Oakwood Academy, some school that happens to exist near the woods. 

I got home that day, kicking off my shoes and throwing my jacket on the bedroom floor as I went to go log onto my Xbox and see who was up for a round or two of rocket league. I had to tell my friends to wait a second when my mum entered my room with a letter in hand.

“Sorry to bother you dear, but there’s a letter from the school for you.” She told me before kissing me on the forehead and closing the door behind her.

I checked out the letter, opening it and looking at the top, it was your typical introduction letter

‘Welcome to Oakwood Academy’ We’re excited to have you here!’ Type of opening.

I went onto the second paragraph which read “Like any other school, we at Oakwood have rules, but we find it imperative that you read the rules stated below”

I groaned in annoyance, knowing it would be your typical type of school rules, I was going to go onto read them until I flinched at the noise coming from my head set

“Yo Jonny are you back yet or what!?” My friend Mike screamed.

“Yeah yeah, one moment.” I sighed, I hate when I forget to mute. I put the letter on my nightstand and headed back onto the game.

Eventually my mother called me down for dinner, I went back up to my room after to play some more games and before I knew it it was 11:00PM. I figured I should sign off and head to bed before tomorrow, being late on my first day might not be the best first impression.

I woke up to the screeching sound of my alarm, rolling over and pressing the snooze as it read 7:00AM

I got up, stretching and changing into my uniform. I remembered the Head Teacher telling me Form Time started at 8:15AM but it was very important I arrived between 7:30-7:45AM for the beginning.

I did the usual morning routine, brushing my teeth, eating breakfast, making myself a lunch before walking out the door and heading on my way. I checked Google maps the night before, and my walk to school was only 25 minutes from where I lived so I figured I’d do that rather than get the bus. I did need to find a local shop to stop at and buy a redbull, the only thing getting me through the day.

By the time I found a shop and was nearing the end of my walk it was already 7:45. I shrugged, remembering form didn’t start until 8:15 so I still had time, but when I got to the school gate, something felt…off about it.

There were still students walking in, so I assumed the rule wasn’t taken that seriously, but there was something weird about them. As I made my way to main reception I noticed the students all moving the same, they were staring forward walking in the same type of unison, but most of all it was quiet. Very quiet. I looked around and noticed no student was talking, just looking in the direction they were walking.

I found main reception, and saw the same chatty lady I met yesterday who led me and my parents to the Head Teacher. 

“Umm…hi, I was told to come here for my first day.” I said, grabbing her attention.

As she turned in her chair to look at me, she had a blank, emotionless stare. Her eyes were dull and void, as if she was looking through me and I didn’t even exist. It was hard to believe it was the same lady from yesterday.

“Oh…yes they told me we were getting a new one today…” She said, in a monotone voice. “Your form is 10ADH, you’re in the Science building on the first floor.” 

“Okay, thank you.” I said, doing my best at giving her a smile despite my unease.

She nodded, and turned back in my chair leaving me to find my own way there.

I made my way to the science building, and thankfully saw ‘10ADH’ on the outside, I took a deep breath before knocking on the door and walking in. 

The teacher at the front and all the other students immediately turned to me, giving the same blank expression.

“Oh…I take it you’re the new one?” The teacher eventually said, breaking the silence.

I felt too uncomfortable to speak, so I walked further in and simply nodded.

“I see…well you can take the open seat at the back of the classroom.” The teacher said, before going back to the board.

I found it strange that he didn’t ask me to introduce myself, but shrugged it off.

My seat was by the back window, next to some boy.

“Hey.” I said, in an attempt to be nice as I dropped my bag under the desk.

The boy turned to look at me, with the same blank stare.

“Hi.” He said, before turning back to face the front.

I sighed before I took a good look around the classroom, and noticed it. Nobody had anything out on the desks. Everybody was still staring ahead, I understood it was only Form, but for nobody to even be doing homework, or speaking to their friends was strange.

I opened my phone and saw I had a missed message from my mum. I raised an eyebrow as I opened the app.

The school just texted, you weren’t in form!? Where are you?’

‘What are you talking about? I’m right here’ I replied.

I could see the little bubbles, as my mum texted again. ‘Well that’s not what the school is saying, I’m checking your location and it’s not at school so where are you!?’

I was going to reply again when I noticed the kid next to me staring at my phone, and then back at me. Something was different about him, it was very faint but it was there. The position of eyes were slightly lower than they were before, it was enough creep me out.

I pretended not to notice as I raised my hand. “Excuse me sir, is it okay if I use the bathroom?” I said.

The teacher barely turned and said yes, before I was out of my desk and out the door.

Here I am now, sitting in the bathroom stall texting this on my phone, my hands refusing to stop shaking.Please, I’m begging. If anyone reading this is an Oakwood Academy student, or knows someone who is, help me. Please.
