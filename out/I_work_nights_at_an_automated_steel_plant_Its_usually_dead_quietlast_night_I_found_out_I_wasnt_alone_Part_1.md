It was 10 p.m. when I pulled onto the highway, music playing, no other cars around. The factory lights were already glowing ahead, the hum of machines almost in my head before I even got there.

At night, it’s just me. The day shift handles the hands-on work. My job is mostly panel checks—HMI/SCADA screens, making sure everything stays in spec.

When I parked, I noticed something odd: a crooked old sedan in the abandoned lot by the decommissioned wing. That part of the plant’s been dead for years, connected but sealed off. No one ever parks there.

Probably day shift, I told myself. Someone forgetting something. I snapped a quick photo of the car, just in case.

Inside, everything felt normal. I grabbed coffee in the break room—still warm from the day crew—and looked out through the tall glass windows. Below me, the aisles stretched on forever, conveyor belts moving like veins under the lights. The sound was strangely calming, a kind of mechanical breathing.

Then I saw someone moving at the far end of the hall.

Looked like a worker in standard gear.

I pushed open the heavy fire-rated door and headed down, coffee in hand. The place is huge—it takes me about four minutes to reach my booth. I checked a few corners along the way, but the figure was gone.

I told myself he’d probably already left.

In the control booth, I tossed my keys onto the console, logged into the HMI, and scrolled through process trends. Everything was nominal. I put on some music (not allowed, but who’s gonna know?) and leaned back.

Sometimes I close my eyes for a bit—“resting them,” as I call it. I must have drifted for half an hour before a deep clang jolted me awake. At the same time, a red banner flashed on the screen: **Line 4 fault.**

Of course. Line 4—right at the transfer to the old mill. The stretch I hate the most. Patchy lighting, shadows that look like they move.

I muttered, *“I hate this job,”* as I zipped up my coverall, clipped my helmet, and grabbed the high-lumen flashlight.

When I got there, the bridge crane had dropped a steel bar across the conveyor. I killed power at the E-stop, wrestled the bar aside, and reset the drive. Everything looked fine. Morning shift could deal with the rest.

On my way back, I froze.

One of the heavy sliders rumbled shut. I knew the sound immediately: the fire-rated shutter at the break-room landing.

I ducked into the booth, half-expecting alarms on the screens. Nothing. My flashlight clinked on the desk as I reached for my keys.

They weren’t there.

They were just… gone**.**

I forget things a lot, so I tried not to panic. Maybe I’d left them in the break room. I grabbed the light and walked to the shutter. It had slammed so hard it bounced back half-open.

I pushed it wider. The break room looked normal, but the air felt… thicker. Wrong.

The lights buzzed to life, and I headed down to the vestibule. That’s when I saw it: a long black trench coat hanging on the rack.

I swear it wasn’t there before.

A chill crawled down my spine.

For the first time, I thought about that old sedan outside.

I turned back toward the stairwell—and my beam caught him.

The worker. Standing at the top of the stairs.

The instant the light hit, he was gone. Not like he ran. Just… gone.

The door slammed again, hard enough I heard the lock throw.

I bolted up the steps, nearly tripping at the top, and yelled:

“HEY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?”

My voice echoed down the stairwell.

No answer.
