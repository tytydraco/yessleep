This is not an intentional suicide note.

I’ve been up for 87 hours. The kind of wakefulness that’s so loud your thoughts echo off the walls of your skull. It’s not insomnia; it's a necessity. The caffeine, it’s… it’s the only thing keeping the engine running, and I’ve driven the thing straight into hell.

The first thing to go was my teeth. It started with little black lines at the base of my molars, like dirt shoved under fingernails. Then came the rot. I’ve seen apples left out on the counter longer than they should be—that’s what my smile looks like now. Brown, mushy spots where enamel used to be. And the smell? I’ve stopped talking to people just so I don’t have to see the recoil on their faces. Sometimes, I’ll catch a whiff of it myself when I’m sipping coffee, and it smells like meat left out in the sun. Rotten, sticky, rancid. My gums bleed every time I take a sip of something hot, but that’s just part of the routine now.

The real problem isn’t the teeth—it’s the cravings. I don’t think about food. I don’t think about sleep. I think about the next hit. The bubbling gurgle of a coffee pot is music to my ears, a Pavlovian trigger that sends shivers down my spine. It doesn’t matter if it’s sludge scraped from the bottom of a gas station carafe or a canned espresso shot I found half-crushed in a dumpster—I’ll drink it. God help me, I’ll drink it.

A few nights ago, I stumbled into a gas station at 2 a.m., looking like I’d just crawled out of a grave. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the coffee cup, spilling hot liquid onto the counter. The clerk looked at me like I was some kind of animal. Maybe I am. When I reached for the energy shots, my hand knocked over the entire display. He told me to leave. I begged him, I actually begged him for just one bottle. When he wouldn’t give it to me, I screamed at him. My voice cracked like dry wood, echoing through the empty store. I don’t even remember leaving.

I’ve started noticing things I can’t explain, things that don’t feel like hallucinations. Sometimes it’s small, like a metallic tang in my coffee that lingers even after I’ve rinsed the pot, or the faint aroma of burnt blood mixed with the steam. But last night… last night was different. I was staring into a mug, black as tar, the surface rippling with tiny oily swirls, when I noticed the color was off—darker, thicker. I tipped the cup slightly, and that’s when I saw it: streaks of red swirling into the black.

It wasn’t a trick of the light. It was real. My gums had been bleeding again, more than usual. As I sipped, I must’ve swallowed some, must’ve let it drip down into the mug. The taste was sharper now, salty and sour, like iron melting on my tongue. I tried to pour it out, but my fingers wouldn’t work right—shaking, sticky, weak. It took all my strength to wrench the cup from my hand, the handle leaving an imprint on my damp, pale skin.

When I dumped it into the sink, thick streams of coffee streaked with blood spiraled down the drain, catching in clumps on the metal grate. The sink filled with the smell—rotting, sickly sweet, a stench so powerful I gagged, tears streaming down my face as I clawed at my own gums, trying to stop the bleeding. But it didn’t stop. It never does.

I’ve started hoarding. The cabinet under my sink is full of expired instant coffee jars, cans of sugary energy sludge, and half-empty bottles of cold brew that smell like vinegar. I don’t throw them out anymore. I can’t. Even the sight of them comforts me, knowing they’re there if I get desperate enough.

And desperate doesn’t even begin to cover it. Last night, I did something I can’t stop thinking about. I was out of cash. No loose change for the vending machine across the hall. Nothing. I was pacing the kitchen, clawing at my scalp, when I remembered the coffee filter in the trash. It was wet, soggy, the grounds clumped together in a cold, slimy mess. I scooped them out with my bare hands and squeezed them into my mouth. The taste was indescribable—bitter, yes, but also sour, rancid, like something decaying. I gagged, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

My skin reeks. Not like sweat, not like someone who needs a shower... it’s sour, it's acidic, like the inside of a trash can after it rains. My armpits, my neck, even my crotch—it all burns. The caffeine’s eating me from the inside out, sweating its way out through every pore. My fingernails are turning yellow. My toenails are brittle. I pulled one off last week without even realizing it was loose.

I’m sweating constantly. My skin sticks to my clothes, and the salt burns when it seeps into the cracks of my dry, peeling lips. My heartbeat is a machine gun, a relentless tattoo against my rib cage that keeps me on edge. Sometimes, it skips. Just stops for a fraction of a second before resuming with a vengeance. That’s when I think, This is it. This is where it ends. But it never does. I have learned that the human body can take so much punishment.

I think I’ve poisoned myself. There’s a pain in my gut that’s been growing for weeks, a gnawing, acidic ache that radiates into my back. The acid’s eaten through something important, I'm sure of it.  A constant churning, gurgling knot of acid and gas that won’t go away no matter what I do. Sometimes, I think I can feel it moving, like something’s growing in there. I’ve stopped looking in the mirror because my stomach is starting to bulge. It's not fat, because when I press on my abdomen, I feel something solid. A mass. Hard, immovable, and just wrong. A knot of caffeine-soaked bile twisting inside me like it’s alive.

I pissed blood this morning.

It wasn’t the first time, but it was the worst. The toilet bowl looked like someone had poured rusted motor oil into it. The pain was so sharp it doubled me over, and I sat on the floor for an hour afterward, trying to catch my breath. When I stood up, I saw the stains on my underwear—dark, red streaks... it looked like someone had slashed a knife across my bladder.

Do you know what I’m most afraid of? Not the heart attacks that linger on the horizon, or the seizures that might be brewing. I’m afraid of running out. I'm afraid of standing in an empty kitchen with nothing left to brew. The thought of being sober is more terrifying than death. I’ve considered… other options. Boiling tea bags and drinking the water like a shot. Scraping the inside of old coffee filters with a knife and swallowing the grounds dry. I’ve even eyed the powdered instant coffee at the bottom of a jar and wondered what it would taste like if I snorted it.

I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. The idea of stopping feels like staring into an open grave. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. The thought of silence—the absence of that jittery hum rattling through my veins—terrifies me more than the pain, the blood, the rot.

Last night, I found myself in the kitchen again, staring at the sludge I’d squeezed out of another old filter. I don’t even remember walking there. My hands were shaking so hard I could barely keep the mug steady, and for a second, I thought about smashing it. Just throwing the damn thing against the wall and ending it all right there.

But I didn’t. Instead, I took a sip.

It tasted like dirt and regret. The texture was gritty, the kind of grit that sticks to your teeth long after you’ve swallowed. But it didn’t matter. It went down like all the others—burning, choking, filling the hollow space inside me that keeps getting bigger.

When I finished, I sat there for hours, staring into the empty cup, waiting for the next craving to kick in. I could feel my body breaking down in real-time. My fingers were cold and blue around the edges, my vision tunneled, but the caffeine kept my heart stumbling forward like a drunk.

I think it’ll stop soon.

Not the cravings—those won’t stop until I’m dead. I mean the machine inside me. The one keeping me upright. It’s been firing on fumes for days now, and when it finally gives out, I’ll collapse, I’ll puke up whatever sludge is still inside me, and I’ll disappear.

But until then, I’ll drink.
