As I thought about where to go next, a familiar voice called out to me.


"Hey!" they shouted. "What happened there? You were missing for a day and a half."


I looked over. The woman in the suit stepped into the open bushy area.


"I was taken back," I said. "I had to find my way back here. What happened to you?"


"I'm struggling to remember," she said. "It's… a blur. I got caught off guard by… something… I looked at the time and 1 hour had passed."


"Can you help me with the three murderers?" I asked.


"What I can do is investigate you, and while doing so, you'd be protected from interference. If anything actually happens, we'll just get the police on the phone." she said. "But come on. You need to come with me."


She walked me through the forest. I was glad to be in better hands. I didn't know which agency she was from, so I asked her.


"I'm affiliated with the Directorate of Science and Technology," she said. "CIA."


The CIA? I could only think of the worst things they've done. MK Ultra, enhanced interrogation… hopefully they've toned it down by now.


We walked onto a parking lot with a single black car. She unlocked the doors and told me to get in the passenger seat. I climbed in, buckled up, and hoped for the best. I decided to ask her some questions, as my curiosity was piqued.


"Is it okay if I ask you questions?" I asked.


"Depends on your intention," she said.


"Curiosity… about how much the government knows about my situation," I said.


"Well, yes, but don't push too hard or it'll be suspicious," she said, starting the car.


"The CIA… is investigating anomalies…?"


"Yes," she said. "We are studying natural scientific anomalies. Our goal is to go on a deep dive and discover everything about the physics of our reality. In this case, alternate realities and teleportation."


"How many people like me have been investigated?"


"Not too many to count," she said. "There's incomplete to no evidence for most of them."


"Was the Man from Taured real?"


"Man from Taured?" she asked.


I explained the story to her. 


"Oh, no, that's an urban myth," she said.


"Any similar stories?" I asked.


"There was a man who mysteriously appeared at an airport in Virginia," she said. "That's all I can tell you at your level."


"Is NASA involved in this?"


"That's a bit above what I can tell you," she said.


"How long has the investigation into anomalies been going on for?" I asked.


"The 90s," she said.


"This is so interesting," I said.


"I'll give you a non-disclosure form to sign," she said. "Until then, I'm going to put the radio on."


"Am I asking too much?"


"No, not at all," she said. "It's just that it's going to take six more hours to get to where you live, so we're definitely going to need some music."


She turned the radio on. A Pop music station was playing The Weeknd and 21 Savage. Seemed normal enough. Nothing was off about the instrumentation or vocals. I relaxed myself, bracing for the rest of the long ride.


I caved in and asked her if I could receive full time protection from my alternate self, despite what she already told me.


"A helicopter is going to circle the area and scan for anomalous signals while 15 agents watch the area," she said. "They're just part of the investigation though. I'll need evidence of danger in order to act against said danger."


Luckily, all those agents were going to be around, so if my claims were proven true, I would be defended. It was nice to hear. I could rest assured, but I wasn't feeling right about the timing. What if my alternate self got tired of chasing me around, then shot me with something he pulled from some alternate reality I've never been to before? I could try to predict what those realities may be, but we didn't have the exact same things happen to us over the past six years, so there was no certainty.


As we drove through rural Pennsylvania, I asked her some things about me.


"How much do you guys know about alternate realities?"


"What I can tell you is we have always speculated about parallel realities. We didn't have much evidence until the 2000s when there was a sudden uptick in anomalous events that pointed to the existence of realities parallel to our own. Again, most of the time, we'd have little to no evidence of the alleged travels, but also little to no evidence disproving those travels. We have images and videos of stuff anomalous people took that we have hidden in our databases that we're… unsure of. The footage we've gotten from you is stuff I've never seen before. But anyway, we've run test after test after test. It's not safe for us to go in ourselves, so we only have what's alleged."


"So no teams came into our reality to talk to us?" I asked.


"We've witnessed anomalies in which people who looked like agents followed… well… other anomalous stuff into this reality, then, brought them back into a portal. We have no idea who they are. They've never spoken to us. Do you know who they are?"


"No," I said. "I've never seen or heard of them before. They must be chasing chaotic things."


"Sometimes they bring people here," she said. "We investigate those people, it turns out they're from here, and they start talking about… terrible places."


"How long has that been going on?" I asked.


"Late 2018," she said. "Even we feel like stuff is being kept hidden from us. We have agents in blue, but they're only one level above mine."


"I mean, I've been to 485 realities… or… well… 490 realities now, and I've never been contacted by them," I said.


"490?" She asked. "Are there any you don't mind talking about?"


"Oh boy," I said. "I've been to realities where the sun was half its size, the Earth had two moons, zombie apocalypses, zombie endemics, a reality where the dinosaurs were still around, where Mu was a real continent… it might sound like I'm ripping stuff from YouTube alternate history videos, but those are some of the ones I was curious about going to."


"Do you have any evidence of you being in these realities?" she asked.


"Well… I've taken some pictures," I said. "But not a lot. As I told you before though, I would like to go back and film all the interesting stuff."


She nodded her head.


"Are these pictures on your phone?"


"Yes, you'll find some on there," I said. "Just look for ones of pink sunsets, very realistic dinosaurs, dilapidated cities, and advanced technology. Smart homes and such. Oh, and I have some pictures I took in personally interesting realities too, so there's those ones, but it'll look like I just edited some webpages or found deleted scenes."


She nodded her head.


"Can you tell me about these personally interesting realities?" she asked.


"They're not very serious, but… I guess if it's important because… alternative realities…" I said, unsure of how much of the lesser serious stuff I was able to explain.


"You're under investigation," she said. "You need to tell me everything you know."


"I've been to realities where certain hyped up video games had been announced and released, where certain singers were much more popular, where one of my favourite shows went on as normal despite the pandemic. It was pretty interesting…"


"Try not to bring any personal opinions into this," she said. "This is just an investigation. We need unbiased information."


"Yes, of course," I said.


"Can you tell me of a specific one of those realities?" she asked.


"There was one where video of the Austin J. Tobin plaza on 9/11 was never lost," I said. "Whoever decided to call it LOL SUPERMAN back in 2006 was a piece of shit. I just wanted to see a rare historical angle."


She nodded her head.


"So, lost footage of historical events?" she asked.


"Not just lost footage," I said. "Unknown information. What if certain things were easy to figure out and had been figured out?"


"Anymore examples?" she asked.


"Well, I found out what happened to that Malaysian flight that went missing," I said. "I'm not sure I want to go there though, in case it turned out to actually be different from this reality."


"Anything else then?"


"I found out who shot JFK by going to a reality in which the shooter was identified," I said. "That sounds like it would be important to you."


"If you're sure of any details potentially being the same as those in our reality, you can tell us," she said. "But remember, we won't just believe everything you say. We'd need to travel to the realities in question for proper evidence."


I told her who the shooter was, then I got in over my head telling her everything else about my travels. I gave her every last detail of most of the other realities I have traveled to. I guess I never opened up about them. It helped me escape the anxiety I had about my alternate self. I was actually having some fun above the fear. I knew it was going to end soon, but with traveling to about 500 different realities, I learned to just live in the moment.


As we drove into Aurora, I was fidgeting with my hands. It was half an hour away. I asked the agent one last thing.


"Is there any advice you can give me?" I asked.


"Lure your alternate self into your room and get him to use the alleged device," she said. "As you've implied, we may have a small window of opportunity here. As I've said, we will be watching you. We have five plans for this scenario. Each one of them is committed to ethics and morality."


Well, it assured me once again. But not completely. With the unpredictability of this, it seemed just as likely things were going to get messy as it was for everything to turn out to be fine.


As we pulled into the driveway, I was frozen. This was it. It was time to face my alternate self. I climbed out of the car, expecting to be shot at any second. I gently opened the door. Once I could peek my head in, I did so gently. Nobody was around.


"Hello?" I shouted.


Nobody answered. I climbed the stairs and checked the living room. No one was there. The silence was killing me. The doors to the other rooms were closed, but I wasn't going to check them anyway. I needed to be in my room. When I walked into my room, nobody was in there. Thank god. I looked out my window. A black helicopter flew in the distance, probably just posing as a training exercise helicopter. I looked at the driveway. The agent was sitting in her car, talking into a radio.


My guts were tight. It was only a matter of time before my alternate self arrived. As I looked at the agent's car, I wondered if there was an alternative to having me face my alternate self. As I thought to myself, I heard three familiar voices. I looked in the direction they were coming from. When the three walked into my view, my stomach clenched harder. I sat beneath the window and listened in on what they were saying.


"It was so satisfying when she stepped on those nails," Billy said.


"Yeah and she was like oh my god! No!" Alternate me said.


The three chuckled in unison.


"And that was the 200th alternate Nicole we killed too," Billy said.


"Yeah… wait," alternate me said. "Who's car is that?"


"The light's on up there," Ian said. "Someone's home."


Well… I hope this ends well.


The front door creaked open. I felt like sinking as I heard their footsteps come in.


"Hello?" Billy shouted as she, along with the others, stepped in. The thumps of footsteps came up the stairs. What was going to be their first reaction? The footsteps got closer and closer, then Billy stepped into view. She looked into the room and stopped. Her eyes widened up.


"Nicole?" she asked. "How?"


I explained to her the whole government agent situation. How I explained every reality I visited. Then I told her if she tries anything, government agents are watching and they will intervene. There was a look of frustration on her face as I gave the warning. She opened her mouth, but then alternate me walked up behind her. She expressed the same amount of surprise.


"What's going on here?" Alternate me asked.


Billy repeated to my alternate self what I had just said. After hearing about what was happening, my alternate self had a confused look on her face.


"How aren't you dead?"


"I guess that place wasn't dangerous enough," I taunted.


Alternate me took out her device and pressed the big button, opening the portal. Her look of confusion turned into a look of determination.


"Step back in," she said. "Right now."


"I'm going to do what makes me comfortable," I said. I stood still, worrying she'd get aggressive, but remembering she wasn't strong enough to pound me.


The front door creaked open again. Multiple footsteps rushed up the stairs. Billy walked up to me, with the deepest look of frustration on her face, and grabbed my hands. I pulled my hands away, but Nicole and Ian walked up to me and grabbed me tight. While I was acting confident, I still felt as if I was about to throw up. I didn't want to go back to that reality. Come to think of it, I no longer wanted to go to any unfamiliar horrific reality for another year. Flashbacks of me watching people hit the ground and explode, seeing the tentacle creatures eat people, and the specks of death flying around all kept popping into my head and triggering anxiety attacks. I needed a break for the sake of my mental health.


I slowly attempted to move, but the three grabbed me tighter in response. I begged for them to let me go, even though I knew it wouldn't work. The dread was only getting deeper. The three brought me over to the portal, and with an overbearing strength, they pushed me back in.


I fell and landed on my back. I stared up at the ceiling, letting myself lay on the soft carpeted floor, wondering why I was still alive.


Well… hopefully I live, right?


I got back up, then I looked out the window. A distant trail of black smoke outlined the horizon. What made it worse was the dead silence. It was pretty surreal.


A light began to reflect in the window. I looked behind me. The portal was open again. A man in tactical gear walked out, stepping onto the floor. He asked me to come with him. As I took a step towards him, something pushed him forwards, straight into me. I fell backwards into the wall with a thud. The man stumbled over to the wall on my right and regained his posture as the Billy, Ian, and alternate me marched out of the portal. Alternate me closed the portal, then walked up to me. Looking me dead in the eyes, she spoke with deep frustration.


"Please understand that I just want you to feel bad for me."


"Um… you want to torture me," I said, still seriously not understanding her logic. "And I want to be comfortable and not scared because I'm about to die."


"You're so stupid," she replied.


"What is going on here?" asked the man in the gear.


Alternate me pointed her device at the man and pressed the button. A portal opened up under the man's feet, causing him to fall. I watched as the portal closed, hoping he wasn't sent to a different gruesome reality.


Two men in suits carrying handguns ran out of the portal. They asked us to freeze and pay attention to them. As they explained they needed us to follow some instructions for research purposes, the front door creaked open. Who could that even be at this point?


"Who's in here?" a male voice shouted.


"I think that's my dad," I said. "But an alternate one of course."


One of the agents walked out into the hallway. He told the man there was a classified investigation happening so he had to stay out of the bedroom. What he responded with chilled me.


"Alright, I see. I guess it has to do with my daughter's death? I know you can't tell me much but I'm looking for someone to talk to after she and her mother were… killed in Richmond Hill."


It was about time I thought more about my parallel self from the reality of the Giant Attacks. It was like speculating on what the fictionalized version of you would be doing in movies like the 2005 remake of War of the Worlds or 2012. Except this was a reality. Another parallel version of me died.


I felt a pain on my neck again. I glanced at my alternate self. She was smiling, Ian was giving me an evil glare, and Billy was giving me a look of disgust while resting her hands on her hips. That was the last thing I saw before I woke up sitting up against a wall in what looked like a bank. There were five others, all looking to be in different age groups, sitting across the room, in the corner to my left. Billy was standing in the middle of the room, speaking to them.


"No one is going to spoil this for me," she said. "I'm going to take the reality hopping stuff further. You know there's realities where advanced weapons exist in easy to use ways. You know there are realities where stuff that's unknown to us has been learned and is very well known. I could learn so much about the universe."


"Please… can I call somebody?" asked one of the older men. "It's not the police, I swear."


She walked into a room on my right. About a minute later, she walked out with a plastic box. She set the box on the ground, then she looked at the group.


"Give your phones to me," she said. "Put them in this box."


The hostages pulled out their phones, stood up, walked over to the box, and dropped their phones in. Then they went back to their spots.


She walked into the room again, this time returning with a water bottle. She twisted the cap off, then she threw it in my direction. She poured water into the bin. The five had distraught faces. The girl kept dumping water into the bin until the bottle was empty. She then threw the bottle at me. She carried the bin over to the five, then she set it down in front of the woman who talked.


"You can take your phones back now."


Alternate me and Ian walked in through the front doors. They raised their eyebrows, looking at Billy as she looked back at them.


"What are you doing?" Ian asked.


"I drowned their phones," Billy said. "Is it time to make them watch?"


"Yes, let's cut to the chase," Alternate me said. She glared at me, staring into my eyes with her usual look of entitled anger. "Nicole, we're tired of chasing you. I'm going to make sure you die here, and I'm going to make sure those people watch it happen."


She pulled out a chrome blue handgun with a design I had never seen before. She walked past Billy, then stopped a couple meters away from me. She pointed the gun at my forehead. There was no higher level of dread I could feel. It was time. In the back of my mind, I knew something like this was going to happen. My alternate self was going to get me somehow, somewhere. Part of me doubted it, as I didn't know what I would've done if I were psychotic and angry. I felt like time was slowing down.


"What k-kind of gun is that?" I asked, expecting little to no explanation.


"It's a brand that gives you the illusion of slowed time while pumping your nerves and organs with sharp pinching robots until you bleed out," she said. "It's from a reality where pain is always ensured as anybody dies."


I shook. Of course she'd explain it with that much detail. I was going out in pain, because of course I was. My alternate self knows all the personal events that have built up to my fear of dying in pain. There was nothing I could say, nothing I could do.


"No," Billy said.


"I need this," Ian said.


A gunshot rang out, striking Ian in the head. He fell to the tiled floor. The people in the corner twitched. The older ones covered their mouths while the younger ones looked more distraught. Alternate me turned around.


"What the hell are you doing?!" she shouted.


"It's best if I do this alone," Billy said.


"Well… I… okay… it doesn't matter," alternate me said. "Don't shoot me."


"As long as you don't interfere, I'll leave you alone," Billy said.


Alternate me pulled the trigger. My stomach was struck an excruciating pain. A painful tingling ran up to my face and down my legs. Alternate me lowered the gun and stared into my eyes with her look of determination. The tingling grew stronger. The excruciating painful bites started on my intestines, making me twitch. I laid on my side, almost jumping at every bite. My stomach and kidneys were the next to be bitten. I wailed. The tingling had grown strong enough to make me lightheaded.


"When will this fucking end?!" I screamed.


The pain was too excruciating for me to talk anymore, so I accepted those as my final words.


Screams echoed from somewhere outside. Billy stepped outside and looked to her left. As the screams continued, she walked towards their source, out of my view.


"Billy!" alternate me shouted. She walked up to the front doors. "Stay there or each of you get what Nicole has," she said, looking at the five hostages. As she pushed the doors open, a white light illuminated everything in the room. Alternate me stopped and looked back at the source of the light. A dark haired woman stepped out. She looked the room over, which included her making eye contact with me. I didn't see a way out of what was happening to my organs, so I didn't bother to scream for help.


The portal woman looked at my alternate self.


"Can you explain to me what's happening here?" the portal woman asked.


"I'm defending myself against my fake alternate self," alternate me said. "Who are you?"


"Agent Arilyn Campbell," the portal woman said.


Arilyn held her gun up at my alternate self's forehead and pulled the trigger. A silver dart struck her. She opened her mouth, but froze before she could speak. Arilyn walked up to her, then she pulled out a handheld device. She held the device up to my alternate self's face. From my angle, I could see a brain was going on. Different parts of my alternate self's brain were lit up. A minute into the scanning, POV videos of walking down side walks, riding in advanced cars, and using advanced phones played.


"So you're the one who's from reality 57470.1 in relation to this reality," Arilyn said. "Let's look at your wrongdoings."


The cool POVs switched to POVs of planting bombs, running people over, throwing people in front of trains, shooting people speaking to an audience, shooting people in various government buildings, drowning people, pushing somebody into a portal, shooting somebody with a glowing blue gun… it wasn't until I watched the repeated portal shoves that I realized the ones in the videos before all had the same oval head shape and facial feature orchestration as me. I had watched my death a couple dozen times over.


Arilyn slid the scanner into her vest.


"I'm taking you in," she said. She put my alternate self's hands in cuffs. This was amazing! I guess there is a team or two out there! Arilyn sprinted up to me. She took a smaller handheld scanner out of her vest and held it up to my face.


"Fuck," she said under her breath. "I'll be right back. Stay here while I get you something."


She took her device out of her vest and opened a portal. She ran into it, leaving me with my frozen alternate self and the shocked looking hostages. My shirt was soaked in tears. My nose, my hands… were red. I threw up on the floor. The portal reopened, then Arilyn sprinted out with a glowing red handgun. She knelt down in front of me, pointed the gun at my stomach, then pulled the trigger. A force hit my stomach. As I squirmed some more, the biting stopped. The tingling began to decrease. The tingling was going back down to the wound. Yes! Arilyn put the gun in her vest, then she pulled out some eye drops she put into both of my eyes. Within a minute, I was in a state of euphoric calmness I hadn't felt in years. Arilyn finished up by putting a bandage over my stomach.


"I'm going to get you to a surgeon for some repairs," she said.


"You're awesome," I said, slipping further into a euphoric high.


Arilyn stood up and walked up to my alternate self. I was glad this was ending, and that I was going to get to stay alive. Arilyn's equipment looked quite advanced. Maybe she was from my alternate self's home reality. That would be quite the narrow-minded assumption, however, considering all the advanced realities there has to be.


Arilyn opened another portal, beside my alternate self. She then grabbed my alternate self by the hands and dragged her into the light.


Three minutes after having left, the portal opened back up. Arilyn stepped out with a look of relief. I made eye contact with her. She looked into my eyes with a look of concern. She closed the portal, then she opened a new one to my left. I noticed right then the hostages in the corner were staring in my direction… likely at the portal, with looks of determination on their faces. Concern accompanied the determination when a certain growling noise echoed in from outside. From the sound of it, it wasn't too far away.


Two paramedics came out of the portal with a stretcher. I was carried onto the stretcher, laid down in a direction giving me a view of the front doors. The growl got louder and louder. A tentacle creature ran in front of the doors, stopping as it saw me. Chills ran down my spine, even despite the medical drug I was put on. It's appearance was still so uncanny. As the paramedics looked me over, there was a bang at the doors, followed by a clicking sound. The hostages' eyes widened. There was another growl, and with that, the hostages got up and ran towards the portal. The paramedics moved to either side of the stretcher and wheeled me through the portal.


"We don't have room for them," said the medic behind me.


On the other side, the portal closed right behind the medic pushing me, revealing a concrete wall. It was over. Well, sort of. I was wheeled down a concrete hallway with windowless steel doors. I was taken into one of the rooms. A surgery room, where I was asked a couple questions about medication, then I was given an anesthesia pill.


"Where am I?" I asked.


"It's best if we let Agent Campbell choose whether to give you that information," the medic said as he put an oxygen mask on my face.


Some time later, I woke up near a waiting room. A flat TV hung off the ceiling above me. A news channel was on. A female reporter talked about released footage of a cyberterrorist's terrifying memories of shooting hostages in the head. Apparently the footage was released via the Freedom of Information Act, and that they captured the terrorist's memories using a brain scanner called HICS.


Am I in some future reality or something?


The date was on the top of the screen, but only the month and day. June 18th.


What year is it?


In the midst of my confusion, Arilyn stepped into the room.


"How are you feeling?" she asked.


"Better," I said. "A little bit drowsy too, of course."


"Well once the anesthesia wears off, I'll take you back to your reality," Arilyn said.


Great! I was finally going back to the comfort of my home reality. All I needed to do was start the discussion about multiverse journalism. I'm going to hold off on going to the darkest realities for about a year, so until then, I plan on going to the tamer realities.


"I just have one question," I told Arilyn.


"Yes?" Arilyn asked.


"I want to become a journalist," I said. "But I want to record the events of different realities. Is there an extra reality hopping device I can have?"


"Well, I could work something out," I said. "But only because when you were asleep, I scanned your memories and saw many of the realities you have gone to. You have much more experience than I do, and it seems you have learned from your reality hopping mistakes. I know I've learned from mine. Hold on a second."


Arilyn stepped out of the room. Once she was gone, I remembered Billy. She said some things, then she left the building. Hopefully she was caught as well. If Arilyn caught my alternate self, she had to have caught Billy too, right?


Anyway, I have a lot of work to do. I'm posting this from an alternate reality on a computer that's able to send signals to different realities. It's pretty cool. I might not give any updates for a while, if I ever do. If I never update again, don't worry. I'm just busy.
