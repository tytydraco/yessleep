**LOG 1:**  
The walls aren’t just closing in, I’ve been willing them closer. As if the dimensions themselves collapsed. Or folded, yes that’s it. I’m reaching out and folding the space here smaller and smaller until only I remain. In this folding room, no one can hurt me. I’ve lost another window, leaving me with only my bathroom window. The bathroom door has shrunken down to a sliver. I have to walk sideways to even get inside now. But it’s fine, I’ll shrink the room around me until only I remain if I have to. 

It’s only been 4 months since I’ve locked myself away in my room and every day since has been… stranger than the last. My final trip was to the grocery store, stockpiling as many supplies as I could fit in my car, the last time I’d use it before selling it off. I bought an ungodly amount of boxed and canned non-perishables and an array of disposable dishes. I planned to never leave my house or room ever again. I also switched to remote work and even though it cost me a pay cut, I didn’t mind. I don’t need the extra money now. 

That first night was tedious, spent it setting up my room with a mini fridge and some plug-in cookery, rearranging my bed so I had direct access to the side yard window so I could fling my trash into the garbage bin, I even had a specially modified pole I could use to open and close the lid and also grab deliveries left by the fence. I set up my mail to be sent electronically and the rest would be dumped into the trash by my housemates. I told them as well to never bother me again, never knock or call under any circumstance. The landlord didn’t care as long as I paid my rent.

The first month came and went without much trouble, only the first week was impeded by adjustment. But we all know that people aren’t supposed to be isolated for so long, we are social creatures after all. Even then, I wasn’t ready to talk to someone else, don’t think I’ll ever be ready again. So I fell into routine and complacency and with each passing day, it must have chiseled away at my mental fortitude. It only took a few weeks for me to fall prey to paranoid ideation as I spent more time reading conspiracy theories and anti-government forums. I ended up blocking those sites since regardless if the narratives were true or not, they were inconsequential to a hermit. Still, some mark had been made, an erosion of the mind had already begun.

It was a slow gradual build to the first hallucination, or that's what I hoped it was. In the proceeding weeks, I’d feel phantom itches and sounds that weren’t really there. Nothing overt, subtle things like someone calling my name while I wore headphones, I’d throw them off to be met with only silence or the sound of my housemates shuffling around the house. Twice I felt the presence of something in the room with me, watching. Skin prickled with gooseflesh, solidifying my fear as real, but subsequent searches turned nothing up. I started to grow weary of the dark corners in my room but it all came to head 2 months ago.

I was sitting at my desk, watching random videos when I thought I felt something wet hit my neck. I grasped it to find it was dry, nothing but a cool sensation. I tried chalking up to some quirk of isolation but twice more I felt the cold tickle of some viscous fluid snaking down my back. I shifted around and searched for a leak, but found nothing every time. I set down a glass of water on my table as I rummaged around my drawers looking for a pill to pop when I heard the wet plop dripping water. My eyes darted to the glass and for an infinitesimal moment, I saw a black wispy tendril descending deeper into my glass and then it was gone, as if it was never even there. A moment of shock, and disbelief passed by before I hefted the glass and inspected it. 

“It’s nothing, you’re tired. Probably vitamin D deficient, been up too late. A man isn’t supposed to be locked away this long, you’ll get used to it, with time.” I told myself.

I ground the pills in my hand together, simple painkillers but hoped they’d bring forth some placebo-induced calm. Casting aside hesitation I threw my head back, tossed in the pills, and took a long drink. I dropped the cup in a panic, water soaking into my carpet as I tried to heave up the water and pills. I swore that the moment I had opened my eyes and stared into the glass I was drinking from, I saw some long insectoid *thing.* Saw the wriggling legs and the writhing segmented body, felt the rasp and scrape of its body in my throat, the clack against my teeth. But when I tried to purge nothing but bile and the two pills spewed forth. 

I think that’s when it started, a man could only say a trick of the mind so many times before he had to face the grim reality. But this is hindsight and I was still blind then. So shakily, stomach churning like a dark storm across the horizon, I told myself it would be fine. 

I can at least construct an illusion of contact with these… logs. For my mental health, I’ll go through the facsimile of social interaction, I won’t fall into madness, I’m too smart for that. I’ve even ordered plenty of multivitamins and make it a point to pace around my room at hourly intervals to try to make up for my new sedentary lifestyle. But I won’t lie, it takes its toll. I sleep like shit and dream like shit. I dream of my childhood and all its injustices. Of every awkward social grace that left people staring and off put. And of every painful moment of reaching out to someone, thinking you’ve found solace only to be shrugged off. Once it hurt me so bad I wanted to pray, to believe something else was out there. Forgiving and promising, absolution. But everything in my life drove me away from something so naive and optimistic. That’s why I've done this. That’s it then, my first entry. I want to write more, but I’m tired, so for now, I’ll try to get some rest. Even as this room shrinks, I’ll search for comfort. I won’t date these, I don’t count the days much anymore, no reason to anymore. This is only for peace of mind, hopefully, the delusions and waking dreams are eased by this.

**LOG 2:**  
It’s been a few weeks since my last entry, I think. Used up the last of my original supplies and I’ve been reliant on several weekly deliveries since my room has shrunk again, folded smaller. I don’t have as much space to store things. I think I did it because my mind is deteriorating. God, I hope it’s just that, afflictions of a diseased mind poisoning itself further with this shit. My resolve almost broke too, I nearly reached for my door knob handle and flung it open but stopped at the sound of a giggle emanating from the house's living room. My face burned with shame, anger, and resentment. 

I don’t care where or who it came from. I don’t want to see them, I don't want to know that they’ve had any joy. This is the reason why I chose to hide away from the world in the first place and it affirmed my choice. That was the moment my world grew smaller and the walls groaned as they shifted and warped until, for the third time, they folded into a smaller space. 

I figured out how to do it in a dream, or it could’ve been a vision, I was lying down, curled up. I wanted nothing more than to fall into myself, smaller and smaller until I wasn’t here anymore. Hours passed in that daze until the sound of my walls groaning and cracking stirred me to life once more. Roots had started to grow through the walls, thick and woody. Twisted and jagged they spread like cancer, destroying the foundations of my prison. Paint flaked from my ceiling and it started to split apart as one particularly large tree root forced its way through, the end pointed and sharp as a blade aimed directly at my heart. I screamed at them to stop and they did, the tangle of roots that had invaded my room and made it look fae came to a deathly stillness. The moment I tried to sit up they began to rot, putrefying and blackening to oily slick tendrils in a matter of seconds, and once more they came to life. Failing and lashing out at the open air like a swarm of eels. Snaking closer and closer to me. I screamed and they slowed but never stopped undulating. With every spasm details etched themselves onto the black flesh, ridges, segments, and protrusions. Until they burst open full of wriggling legs and antennae, centipedes. Hundreds of them writhing and chittering as I struggled to flee.  
  
Casting my gaze to the ceiling I saw that the largest tree root had transformed into a massive coiled centipede, its body as thick as my torso. Shiny beady eyes focused on me as it hungrily gnashed its mandibles. It tensed its body, preparing to strike. I had no strength left to stand and so I reached out to the walls, towards the corners, grasping at them with more than just my hands. Something deep within my mind reached out and found purchase on some unseen corner, a metaphysical dimension. In the moment of my doom as the creature arced through the air towards my throat I pulled some unseen threshold closer. And the room shrank, folded, and collapsed into smaller dimensions. The walls closed in, leaving the wriggling monstrosities trapped behind what used to be. 

I awoke and felt the shift immediately, and knew that the space had changed. I gave a cursory inspection and almost missed it, but the space between the window and the door had shrunk. An old movie poster tacked onto the space signaled this phenomenon through the way it scrunched into itself. I tried yanking it free but it refused to give from the wall until it tore, the entire midsection of the poster gone, as if the wall had taken a bite out of it. 

A scream welled up from the deepest pit existing within me. And yet I could not give it voice, shame and self-loathing drowned out even fear. Dejected, I collapsed onto the floor, curled up, wondering if it was another nightmare. With the passage of countless hours the shock numbed and got up, logged onto my computer, and started working, as if nothing happened, in that I’m not so different from others.The second folding came in the heights of rage and despair. I had adjusted to my new dimensions in a matter of days and I hardly noticed the missing space. Days dragged on wistfully and I started to feel the cracks, the urge to just leave my room and give up on my endeavor to close myself off forever. I paced back and forth just working up the courage to touch my doorknob. Eventually, I did come to rest my palm on it, feeling the way my heart thrummed anxiously through the cool metal. I held my breath as I turned the knob only to feel its refusal to budge, locked. Of course. Another half hour was spent working up the nerve to unlock the door and try again. 

Muffled sounds from beyond the door, snaking through the hallway, burning themselves into my mind and shattering my resolve. Soft creaking and moans.  My two housemates were both single before I had cut them off. A friend or lover didn’t matter. I’d forgotten that I wasn’t alone, not truly. No matter how deep the pit I’ve tried digging myself into just beyond the walls they were still there. With their joys and triumphs, their desires and passions, theirs, not mine. Never mine, never mind. Fuck them. I found the contours again, easily this time as if I had always known them, and with a determined grip and grit teeth the world collapsed around me again. Smaller, safer, better. 

The moment of jaded indignity drained out of my strained muscles over a few seconds and guilt crept in to replace them. But that too settled to the bottom of my being, along with the rest of life’s sediment and all I was left with was my ever-shrinking living space.

I’ve tried to feel something, panic, confusion, horror. But today I just feel numb, I can’t even muster the strength to try to rationalize. It’s only when I look at the wall where my poster and window used to be that I feel anxiety prickle throughout my body once more. Most inconvenient is my bathroom door now, it’s a hassle to squeeze through and I’m grateful to actively be losing weight. 

I crawled into bed again, wishing to fall asleep but it never came. So I just let the hours tick by, sleepless. Once I dreamt of better days, always putting all my hopes on tomorrow. Days blur together now, meaningless. Sunlight is just an abstract concept I almost forget about until I’m forced to open my black-out curtains and even then that’s only sometimes and if this room keeps shrinking even that will be a fading memory. Maybe I’ll join them.

**LOG 3:**   
It’s been a while, I think 6-7 days. I’ve shrunk my world again. Not the physical space of my room more so I’ve been cutting off avenues to access it online. Blocked as many news sites as possible, closed any social media accounts I had, and turned off notifications to all my devices. Considered chucking my phone out the window but it still serves the purpose of keeping me distracted during the fleeting time I actually lay down. I’m sleeping less, I think I go days at a time without its release.  Fatigue clouds my mind, and the equilibrium of my perception shifts to and fro making working out difficult, which it already was because of the collapsed parameters. So I find myself staring at my computer screen for nearly every waking hour. 

I don’t even do anything on it most of the time, just absent staring and savoring the darkness in between blinks. I don’t work much anymore, I’ve started to fall behind on my duties. I tell myself that I'm going to force myself to spend some serious time just catching up but I know I lack the willpower to do so. I’m afraid of being fired, and losing my paycheck. That means I’m cut off, no way to pay rent, they’ll throw me out and that means… death. I don’t care about the eviction but I'll die before I suffer the indignity of seeing another face, though  I know I’m too much of a coward to go through with that promise. I thought the ability to hope had died out long ago but against the grinding surface of my resentment, I still find its spark and it burns just holding it. I want to toss it away and be done with it but it eats away at my flesh and burrows into muscle. It is part of me now and it hurts, yet I hope anyway that things will work out in the end.**LOG 4:** Time has passed, but I’m not sure how much. By some miracle, I’m still employed so maybe It hasn’t been too long but I have to write this down. I think the room is shrinking again and it’s not me this time. I haven’t slept since my last entry so it could be a hallucination or my mind giving in to paranoia but I can't help but shake the feeling that when I’m not looking the corners inch ever closer, slowly and gradually.

I’m falling victim to microsleep. I’ll lose moments of consciousness at frequent intervals but I know they never last longer than 30 seconds, but it’s then when the walls cave in and will themselves closer, I am their center, this I know somehow. I’m going to try to lie down, I’ve been sitting here at my desk for god knows how long, only broken by the need to use the bathroom. I don’t want to sleep, I need to catch up on work, or else, I die. I don’t even know why I want to keep fighting to live. I just know that I don’t want to die. I only wanted to be forgotten. And what if I close my eyes and awaken to a coffin, the walls collapsing to vacuum tight seal and I’m left to suffocate, or worse, live? Maybe I’d be lucky and never wake up again, that would be nice… In an hour or so, I’ll try and hope.

Another lapse of consciousness befell me, I don’t know for how long, had to be less than a minute but I was awoken by the wet scratchy tongue of something vile and desiccated running alongside my neck, around the rim of my ear and into my ear canal. I jolted awake a scream rushing up my lungs but it beat me to it, Its raspy wheezing shriek killing my own in its infancy. The echoing wail bounces around the room but I can’t find the source. I jump up to flick a light switch and instead trip over my wobbly legs and fall at the feet of some gnarled obsidian fleshed monstrosity. I reel back with a yelp to look at it, see it illuminated by the pale glow of my computer, and am met with nothing but the fading afterimage of its silhouette. An ironic wake-up call, I crawl to bed, heart still pounding, adrenaline flushing out of my system and leaving me more exhausted than I ever have been in my life. The bed is noticeably smaller. The first few inches of it, along with my headboard and part of the pillows fused to the wall. The wall at least has pushed it closer to the center. Maybe there is something else here with me, hiding in some corner not yet fully revealed, they do say when you close one door another opens. Or maybe it’s subconscious, maybe my sleeping mind remembers the contours and edges of this room and grasps at them, either through instinct or desire. I can’t say, but mercifully, and cruelly, sleep has me in its hold. If I wake from this, I’ll try and escape my prison.  
  
**LOG 5:**  
I awoke to the sound of knocking. I deluded myself into thinking that I could escape this room, that I could find the will to open that door and walk out and rejoin that world that drove me here in the first place. But when I heard the door knob jiggle, any hope or confidence disintegrated into dread bordering hysteria. I had faced no greater fear until that moment. My entire life I’d been stalked by longing and bitter disappointment, driven away farther and farther from what I ached for. So I resolved to want nothing, a foolish wish just like the rest of my dreams. A mere shadow dissipated by the promise of a better tomorrow. For once, I thought I found someone who looked at me the same way I looked at them, someone who understood someone who knew. My touch was shrugged off before it could be laid and I was left forgotten, abandoned. I should have known better, I had forgotten that this was nothing, that we were nothing, that I was no one. Still, I felt the sting of hope’s venom, a dream turned to agony, and what I thought I wanted, I grew to hate. Never again I said, swearing a new oath, casting a new wish, throwing myself to the flames. Etching it into my heart, like a mantra.

As the knocks rose to banging on my door and intelligible words gleaned through the walls I screamed back, begging them not to come, begging them to spare me of the curse of hope. That some salvation lies beyond the doors, the walls, the prison of my making. I feared falling prey to the promises of “maybe tomorrow” more than anything that lurked in this room. Tears streamed down my face as a scream so visceral tore at my throat as it clawed its way out of me. I desperately grabbed at the corners of this little section of ever-shrinking reality and pulled with all my might. I imagined I was slamming the doors shut on encroaching hell with such force it rattled the very foundations of its being and yet it wasn’t enough. I pulled and pulled until the room groaned in agony as it fell and folded once, twice, and once more before I was left with silence, the incessant knocking and voices cutting out in an instant. Looking around there were no windows left, nor bed, nor door leading me out of this place. Only a closet-sized dark space containing my computer desk and chair. That and a thin sliver leading to my bathroom. I had to contort myself into uncomfortable angles to squeeze through. Once inside I realized the walls here too shrunk in. A sink and toilet were all that remained. No windows, no escape.

A demented laugh came over me as I realized that now, I’d be truly alone and safe. Even if they fired me at this moment, no one would be able to force me from this place. For once, I got what I wanted. I left the bathroom and sat at the computer desk. No internet, cut off from the world all that remains are these documents. 

I wondered about how I’d feed myself and how I’d sleep but the urge to do either had been gradually fading. Maybe I’d eventually starve to death and my mummy would be left here in this inaccessible place. So I sit and stare at this screen, let the irate glow and wash over my eyes and flesh. Maybe my mind would fracture slowly over time in its hypnotic gaze, splintering further and further until it was unable to interact with itself. Maybe my eyes would burst then and leak down my cheeks and I’d feel no pain since no one would be at the helm anymore. A new wish, as if I hadn’t drank my fill yet. Maybe that's part of human nature. I don’t know if such introspection even matters anymore. I’m alone, no one will read this, only I exist here, so I recline back, try to get comfortable, and wait for oblivion to claim me.

**LOG 6:**  
I don’t know how long it’s been. I usually start these entries saying something to that effect but this time I truly mean it. Time has lost meaning, there is no time here I think. I haven’t eaten since the last entry, nor found the urge to excrete any waste. Thirst however still hounds me, I feel parched, flaking. In the dim glow of the computer, I look at my hands, see that they are aged, withering, I cannot recognize them as belonging to me. I am emaciated and thin, yet hunger is a sensation so far gone I hardly remember its pain. Sleep is ephemeral and dreamless. I blink and in a moment I am its depth, within the next blink, I am awake, never losing the stream of consciousness. I only know I slept because my exhaustion is alleviated, if only for a fleeting time. Is this heaven turned to hell? Or did I try to fashion hell into paradise? Maybe this is the limbo the poets wrote about, stuck in a space in between. Does it matter? All I know is I’m not alone. 

There’s something in the walls, it’s always been here, I felt its presence a few times. I think it can only manifest periodically, Maybe when I'm not looking and my mind is fatigued. Only through the folding of this room have I been able to keep it at bay. I think in my bouts of microsleep my subconscious inched the walls closer in an attempt to keep me safe. I shrugged off the visions as nothing more than lapses in sanity. But now I know it’s real, I have felt its touch. In the midst of sleep, it held me by the throat and took a bite out of my flesh. I awoke screaming, and looked it in the face, a writhing mass of insectoid tendrils draped its form, hiding its true visage. Blood poured from the wound it left on my cheek and I yelled and tried to pry myself from its grip. But it held firm as more of its form unfurled. Like a maturing fern, a spiral of glossy black chitin length curled around me and a mandible-lined maw blossomed before my face and went in for another bite. Time slowed as I found purchase of the contours again and folded this place once more in a blink it was gone and I was met with walls touching my chair on all sides.   
  
No bathroom anymore. Not even a desk. My computer screen was now embedded into the wall, the keyboard jutting out just beneath it. I think there are two possibilities now. It lured me here, letting me isolate myself so I made easy prey, or maybe it’s opportunistic. Seeing easy prey it chose to strike but I’ve foiled it through this ability to fold space into itself. Maybe it’s something else and this thing is toying with me, giving me the ability to shrink this one space so that it has a challenge, seeing how much It can wear me down before it strikes. Or maybe I’ve gone stark-raving mad being isolated for so long. I’ll do the only thing there's left to do and leave it at that, condemn myself to whatever fate awaits me. I’ll lose the chair, and my computer, grip the edges of this place once more, and make a coffin for myself. If anyone is reading this, though I hope no one does, this is the last time. Never again, I commit myself to eternity. 

**LOG 7:**  
I crawled for years in that endless place. Inching ever forward, painfully contorted, scraping away flesh and scabs. The Beast trailed me every moment, lapping up the stream of blood left behind by my efforts to outpace it. Occasionally it catches me and scrapes its toothy tendril-like tongue across my feet and ankles, stripping the flesh and relishing the taste with a bone-rattling howl. 

When I last collapsed this room I hoped it would be a skin-tight coffin and that I’d slowly succumb to suffocation, or have my mind splinter into sweet oblivion. Instead, the dimensions warped into an infinite, narrow tunnel. I was caught in its vice grip, left to panic until the ceiling gave way and gravity shifted so that I could crawl through it. This final folding swallowed everything, my desk, my computer, and shut it behind some now unreachable door. Darkness was all I had left, that and this endless race against the Beast. 

Always the Beast was preceded by a horrid sound, a creaking and seismic shifting that forced me to action. I slept when my strength and body gave out and even then I almost always awoke to the pain of the Beast’s maiming.  

In the past, I thought it was punishment, divine or profane. I didn't know and didn’t care, I simply roiled in the anguish that the hate for my existence transcended humanity itself. But that’s an arrogant thought, I don’t matter to anyone and in that, I found a little solace. Then I thought I had been unlucky enough to slip into some recess of existence known to few and prowled by the Beast. I’ve come to decouple myself from caring about justifications now, all I seek is sleep most of all, salvation was a dream beyond me.

I hadn’t been able to find the edges of this room anymore and couldn’t shut away. It makes sense, this space cannot shrink anymore, this is its final configuration. But I was still too afraid to give in, I chose to crawl, even if it was hopeless, I chose to crawl until I couldn’t. I clung to the hope that my mind would shatter before my body could, so when the Beast came for me there would be no pain. That didn’t sound so bad. Time immemorial came and went and I crawled forward as a ragged strip of flesh. I imagined that I had rasped my skin away and I was a flayed sinewy thing slithering through this dark tunnel. The pain had dulled and only the Beast’s attack stirred true agony. Each fleeting rest came with greater fatigue in my awakening, a fog was drifting in behind my eyes and I tasted it, oblivion. I screamed. For the first time in an eternity, I managed more than a weak moan, a shrill, whistle-like vocalization I couldn’t recognize as my voice.   

Something gave way. It must've been only a difference of a few millimeters, and yet it was like a long-held breath had finally been expelled. The corners of this room had known my touch once more, this time hungering for space. In its bliss, I slept. I dreamt for the first time in eons, dreamt of a distant abstract warmth. Sunlight, I forgot what it even looked like, let alone felt like. Only a mirage of a fragment remained within me but it was enough for me to break and wake with tears and wail, this time certain the cry was my own. The curse was upon me once more, longing, hope. 

The quaking roar of the Beast and the tremble of the tunnel signaled its proximity and fear flushed into me, fueling my final desperate grasp. I reached for the corners of this room and felt the Beasts bite into muscle and bone as I found purchase. I didn’t know what I was grasping at, but knew that I wanted out and for the first time since this hell began, I pushed against the walls, screaming with all my might for them to open. Before the Beast, my Beast, could devour me. I broke through into overwhelming, oceanic pain and sensory overload, the agony of birth. I couldn't open my eyes, my head swelled and ballooned at the smells and sounds, and my limbs ached with their unfurling. It took some time for me to adjust to my surroundings, I had forgotten what a forest was, but the damp mossy earth beneath my feet was unmistakable. A canopy of trees shielded me from the full extent of the sun’s cruelty and I felt my lungs come alive with every verdant breath. Skin pricked with goosebumps at the bliss of a light misting. Looking around I saw the hole I had burst out of, a tiny cramped space only a few feet deep. Coiled ferns, lichen-laden bark, rugged rocky walls, these are the things that brought fresh tears to my face. The sound of cars, like roaring wind, was echoing in the distance, I was not far from civilization.

The transition into normalcy wasn’t as hard as I expected. In the end, I had been dealt no major wounds and though I was left with dozens of permanent scars, my body healed. I relearned to speak in under half a year and by month 8 I was working again, as a janitor in the dusk hours so that I wouldn’t be overwhelmed by people. I saw my family again, they rushed to greet me and hug and sob at my emaciated form, two years had come and gone since I’d last seen them. I didn’t think they’d care. In all fairness, my welcoming party was only 6 people, but that was still more than I had ever fathomed.

I don’t want to give anyone an empty platitude. I don’t know if things got better or what I could have done to prevent my descent into that hell. Maybe I had to suffer through it to see an end, maybe I’ll fall back into habit. Maybe forces beyond my control and tragedy will see the world fold and collapse around me once more and I’ll be face to face with the walls of my prison and the Beast once more. But I do know one thing. Fools are those who answer the beckoning call of that which harms them. I am nothing but a fool then, even though it’s hurt me countless times. I want to hope again. I want to hope that there’s a better tomorrow for me. I want to try to connect with people again, even if it’s only a few. I want to try to live again, I want to feel the sun’s warmth and know it’s ok.
