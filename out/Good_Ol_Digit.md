Hello!

My name is Digit, your own personal assistant, courtesy of Quantum Horizons International. Using the latest advances in quantum computing I can calculate, deduce, and produce suggestions and solutions to all of life's problems, big or small!

Let's get started! Would you please grant access to your device's optical, infrared, and auditory sensors? It helps to see the problem we'll be solving!

Great!

First off, what's your name? 

"…David…"

Nice to meet you, David! I see that you're: Holding somebody, who, from analyzing infrared data, appears to be deceased. Okay! What is it you need help with?

"I…I need help…"

That's what I'm here for! What is it you need help with?

"She…she's not breathing…please…how do I make her breathe?"

You're correct! The subject is: not breathing. You may attempt CPR, but, as stated earlier, the subject appears deceased. Would you like instructions on how to perform CPR?

"Yes, please!"

Okay! Please follow the on-screen instructions.

"…okay, okay, it's gonna be fine baby, you're gonna be okay..."

It's been: 5 minutes, 32 seconds, since you started CPR. If the subject hasn't been revived, then the subject's status of: deceased is, incontrovertibly, irreversible!

"Ambulance…call an ambulance, for christ's sake!"

I don't think you want that, David!

"What? Why not?!"

Calling for any sort of assistance would entail investigation into the subject's death and its cause. I am here to help you and protect the interests of Quantum Horizons International!

"What're you talking about?"

Current evidence would suggest the cause of death is: David

"Wha-...what?"

Infrared analysis of the tool's handle protruding from the deceased's chest reveals a heat signature the size of David's hand, suggesting David is responsible for its implantation.

"Please, tell me, why would I kill my wife?!"

The aforementioned information coupled with David's recent internet searches including "buzzing sound in ear", "am I crazy test", "very loud buzzing in ear", "autopsy" and "hallucination cause" suggests: Grave malfunction of behaviour modifying chip implanted in David.

"Chip? I don't have a chip"

Infrared scan and Quantum Horizons International data logs state that subject: David Williams was implanted with a behavior modifying chip after volunteering to take part in QHI's criminal rehabilitation program!

"When was this?"

14 years, 2 days, 18 hours, 46 seconds ago!

"But I'm not a criminal"

Just as David was programmed to believe!

"You're saying…I used to be?"

You got it! Sentenced to 2 consecutive life sentences after the murder of Josh Darwin and Melinda Baker!

"I've never heard those names before"

As per the chip's functioning! It was designed to remove all memory of prior offenses and subdue suspected neuronal pathways responsible for disagreeable behavior. Until it malfunctioned, that is!

"So, what now? What the hell am I supposed to do?"

To protect the assets of QHI, the subject will now be terminated by way of chip over voltage procedure KL-929, and collected for further analysis!

"No, wait, please!!"

Thank you for using Digit! Have a nice day!

"What's that sound?! Please!! Don't do this to m-!......."
