I found myself driving down a desolate road, swallowed by the darkness of a moonless night. The rain drizzled gently but steadily, adding to the eerie atmosphere of my journey through the mountainous terrain. The dirt road gradually narrowed, leading me to an old tunnel notorious for being "haunted" by the locals.

As I approached the tunnel, my senses went on high alert. The air grew heavy, and my heart raced faster than usual. Yet, there were no alternative routes, and I had no choice but to press on.

Once inside the tunnel, it felt as if time itself had vanished. The tunnel's walls seemed to stretch infinitely, and my headlights could only pierce a small portion of the enveloping darkness. The sound of my tires on the road seemed to disappear into the silence.

Then, in the distance, I noticed flickering lights, resembling dancing candles. They moved, drawing nearer with each passing moment. Glancing in my rearview mirror, I spotted similar lights emerging from the tunnel's entrance. It was as though a procession of ghostly flames was approaching.

My stomach churned with fear, but there was no turning back. I continued my journey through the seemingly never-ending tunnel as the dancing lights inched closer. Shadows appeared to move along the tunnel's walls, as if they were living entities, and eerie whispers echoed through the air.

Suddenly, my car's engine died. Darkness surrounded me completely, and the silence became deafening. I tried desperately to restart the car, but the engine remained unresponsive. My cellphone became my sole source of light.

In that timeless space, I began to hear faint whispers emanating from the encroaching darkness. They knew my name, and they were calling for it. The dancing lights were now directly above me, resembling luminous eyes peering into the depths of my soul.

Terror gripped my heart as I felt a chilling touch on my shoulder. I turned to see a dark, faceless figure reaching out towards me. My scream echoed within the tunnel as I struggled to escape, but the door was completely stuck. 

It was as if the very fabric of reality was unraveling around me. The whispers grew louder, and their words became clearer, though they made no sense. "Join us," they hissed, "become one of us." The faceless figure's grip tightened, and I could feel its icy fingers digging into my flesh.

I was on the verge of despair, convinced that I would never escape this nightmarish ordeal. The lights above me intensified, casting an otherworldly glow that made it impossible to distinguish reality from hallucination. The tunnel itself seemed to pulse with a malevolent energy, as if it were a living entity.

Just as I thought all hope was lost, a deafening roar shattered the oppressive silence. My car's engine roared back to life, its headlights piercing the darkness. It was as if some unseen force had come to my rescue. Without a second thought, I slammed my foot on the gas pedal and sped towards the tunnel's exit.

As I burst out into the moonlit night, the tunnel behind me returned to its normal length. The lights and shadows that had tormented me dissolved into the darkness, and the haunting whispers faded into oblivion. I was free, and the oppressive weight that had settled upon me lifted.

As I drove away from the "haunted" tunnel, I was thankful to have survived the horrifying experience. However, one thing was clear:this was the last time Iâ€™do shrooms before a long night drive.
