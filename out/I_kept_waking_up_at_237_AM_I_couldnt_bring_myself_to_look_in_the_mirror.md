I looked over at the digital clock on the nightstand. 2:37 AM. Again. I didn’t dare turn over, and check the mirror, ever since it happened.



A single moment, after which time and space seem to have stopped. Days became meaningless, losing their names, numbers or colors. Everything that mattered to me, did not matter anymore. It was gone.



Moving slowly from my side of bed by habit, I stood up, and got out of the room with my back turned to the mirror. I was too scared to look at her again. Our little brains play little tricks on us all the time, especially in the dark. We see things that we know are not there, spending the rest of the time convincing ourselves that we didn’t.



That is at least, what I told myself. I went to the bathroom, through the already opened door, thinking it was my bladder that woke me up, not the…*I lied to myself once again*. I knew that was not true. As I stood above the toilet having my back turned to an already covered mirror above the sink, I could not relieve myself. The cover should have given me some relief, but it didn’t. I still felt as if a gaze coming from under it.

Having no mirrors in the hallway, I stayed there for a moment, darkness shrouding me. Four days have passed since I have seen her eyes for the last time. In flesh. But it’s been two days since I actually saw her last. She was terrified, but so was I. It was the only time I turned my back on her, literally and figuratively, in our 17 years of happiness. Echoes of her could be often heard around the house. That was no trick however, I wish it were. I could hear faintly and distantly crying. But, I knew I couldn’t help her. Not anymore. I didn’t want to go back to the bedroom. If I laid there, I knew I would feel her on the other side of the bed.

Going downstairs, I looked over at the pictures by the stairs. Our date, our first vacation, our first gender reveal. It should have made my gut sink, but it didn’t. I felt something far more terrifying. A vast emptiness inside me, from the life that seems to be gone. I sat in a dark living room, trying to collect my thoughts.

Her parents insisted that we should be there for her sister’s wedding. It’s a big event, and she was nearly nine months pregnant, not fit to travel. They made us change our plans at the last moment, but I should have listened to my gut four nights ago. I should have insisted we stay at home. I should have not taken the wrong turn. I should have taken a rest at the roadside motel. I should have prioritized getting rest instead of making it in time. I shouldn’t have fallen asleep on the wheel.



One of us lived, and the other did not. I felt it in my soul, which felt ripped from her warm presence. I don’t remember much, except that last moment, part of a moment hearing her scream and me running into the tree on the roadside immediately after. Only darkness after. The next thing I remember was waking up at 2:37 AM in my own bed, exactly at the time the accident happened. She was there though. As I woke up and looked in the mirror by our bedside, I could see her there. Her sorrowful face twisted into screaming, and I did not dare to look in the mirror ever since. I felt I was betraying her, but she shouldn’t have been there.

The weight of it got to me. I was frightened to do it, but I owed her at least that much. I slipped into the guest bathroom, ready to look into the mirror again. Streetlight dimly illuminated the bathroom through the window, and I raised my head, ready to face her. I did not see her in the mirror though. I didn’t see myself either.
