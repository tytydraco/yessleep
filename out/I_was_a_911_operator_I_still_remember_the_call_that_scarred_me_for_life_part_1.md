“911, what is your emergency?” I said, answering on the first ring. It had been a slow day up to that point, but that was all about to change in a moment.

“I just saw something bad,” a hysterical female voice cried on the other end of the line. “My neighbor, she’s outside, and she’s bleeding…”

“Bleeding from where?” I said.

“Everywhere!” she screamed. I tried to get her address, but she was so hysterical that she kept yelling for help. Eventually, she calmed down enough to give me her street. I heard new voices in the background, all shrieking.

“We have a unit on the way,” I said. “Just stay on the line with me. It’s going to be OK.”

“No,” she whispered, barely audible over the screaming in the background, “it isn’t.”

\*\*\*

A few minutes later, I was in the break room, getting a coffee, trying to stop my hands from shaking. I was hyperventilating, full of an incomprehensible terror and anxiety that I had never felt on this job before. Before the call had cut out, it sounded like a street full of rabid people had surrounded the caller’s house. Then the radio came on from the police unit that had been first to arrive at the scene.

“Dispatch, you there? This is Shea.” I heard the voice of Trooper Shea crackling. I immediately picked up on the back-up unit we kept in the break room.

“This is dispatch,” I said. “What’s going on?”

“I came down Kansas Street from Union Road, and it’s totally empty except for a few bloodstains. Were you able to get the house number of the caller?” he asked.

“Negative on that,” I said. “Do you see any broken glass or smashed down doors? It sounded like pure hell at the end of the call. She claimed she was being attacked by her neighbors.” Trooper Shea consulted with his partner on the street for a moment before responding.

“We just heard screaming and glass shattering. It sounded like it came from number 67 on Kansas Street. Send back-up.” I ran back to the main room. We had a new system that could livestream 911 calls directly to the cars of police in the area, as well as livestream audio from the car back to dispatch. I turned it on, entering the number of Trooper Shea’s patrol car and listened intently.

“Come out with your hands up!” I heard Shea’s partner yell. Shea gasped.

“Oh God, she needs medical attention,” he said. “She’s got blood coming out of her eyes, her ears, her nose… and vomiting blood. What do you think she has?”

“Ma’am, stop right there!” Trooper Shea yelled. “Do not come closer!” Then I heard a rash of swearing and yelling followed by a gunshot. I dropped my coffee cup on the floor, hearing it shatter and spread burning hot liquid across my shoes, but I was so engrossed and horrified by what I was hearing that I barely noticed.

“Oh God, she bit me!” Shea’s partner said. “She bit my fucking thumb off!” I heard another series of gunshots, then the slamming of car doors.

“Go, go, go!” one of them said, and I heard the squealing of tires.

“Oh, fuck, what is that?” Shea said, then his voice came in over the radio. “Dispatch, this is Shea, and we have a major obstruction blocking the intersection of Kansas and Main. It looks like… I know this is going to sound batshit insane, but it looks like a pile of bodies. Literally hundreds of them, stacked on top of each other like firewood. Maybe they’re just mannequins, I don’t know, but most of them look like they’re bleeding. We need back-up immediately, and emergency medical services as well. Trooper Ingraham lost a finger when we got surrounded by a dozen drugged-up or sick lunatics back there. One of them bit me on the damn calf through my uniform, but I don’t think it will require medical attention. They were biting, scratching and hissing like snakes… there’s something wrong here, I’m telling you.”

“This is dispatch,” I said, “and back-up is on the way.” I wanted to tell him to get the hell out of there, drive the other way, but I wasn’t a cop. I had no authority to do any such thing. They would likely think it was their primary duty to secure and protect the scene until other police arrived.

My shift was about to end in a few minutes when this insanity began, and my replacement walked in just as I hung up the radio. She looked at me, one eyebrow raised.

“You are not going to believe this,” I told her, and briefed her on everything that was happening. Her mouth opened more and more as I recounted the story, her eyes widening in horror. And by the end, I still hadn’t heard from Trooper Shea or his back-up. I was having anxiety and just wanted to get out of there. My family lived nearby, and if there was some sort of crime spree or pandemic happening, I wanted to be home to protect them. My son was only seven-years-old, and I knew he couldn’t protect himself in such an apocalyptic calamity as was occurring in our little town.

As she sat down in the dispatcher’s chair, another 911 call came in, and I took the opportunity to get my stuff and head out of there.

I had only a five-minute drive back home. My knuckles were white as I sped down the residential streets at thirty miles over the speed limit. Traffic was sparse, and I saw nothing out of place.

Until I turned onto my street, that is. My neighbor was an elderly man whose six-year-old granddaughter lived with him. Both of them were standing in the middle of the road, staring up at the sun, their mouths open. I saw long knives in each of their right hands.

I slammed on the brakes a few feet away from them, but they didn’t stir. I tried honking my horn, but they just kept staring up at the sky, without any awareness.

As I looked down from their faces, I realized they were both viciously sawing at their bodies, opening up shallow slice after shallow slice. A waterfall of blood began to run down their skin, soaking into the pavement. I nearly threw up in disgust. I backed up, driving on my neighbor’s lawn to get around them, putting down the window to yell as I passed by.

“What the hell are you doing, Mr. James?” I screamed at him. “Stop this now!” I wondered whether I should jump out and try to stop them, but with their current mental states, I felt they might be just as liable to stab me as not if I got out.

Suddenly Mr. James’ eyes came down, focusing directly on mine, and the knives stopped moving. The little girl grinned at me, waving the blood-soaked butcher knife back and forth, sending droplets of crimson spraying on my car and on her dress.

“It’s… she’s telling me to cut myself, to let the viruses in,” Mr. James said, and his granddaughter stared straight ahead like a doll. It was as if they felt no pain. I saw the blood-covered tendons and muscles of their legs, stomachs and chests as they stood there, slicing deeper and faster, wavering like trees in a hurricane. Mr. James fell to the ground, blood continuously pouring out of him, and his granddaughter pointed behind me, nearly tripping, her head lolling from side to side as her lips started to turn a light blue, probably from the constant blood loss and impending physical collapse.

“She’s here for you, too,” she said. “She wants to play with you. She wants you to open up and let the viruses slide in… they look for the soft, warm spots. They’re so cold. Open it up and let them in, and you’ll never be sad again.” Slowly, I turned, seeing the corpse of a girl standing there next to a tree in my neighbor’s backyard. Her skin was bleached-white, and her mouth was sewn shut, ugly black stitches marring her cyanotic, purplish lips. Her stringy black hair hung down past her shoulders, framing her face as she stared directly at me. Her eyes were milky white, like cataracts, and I saw countless maggots wriggling throughout her body, eating away at the skin of her arms and legs.

“Do you feel the wetness of their tongues? The dead ones just want in,” her voice rang out in my head, distorted and demonic and low. Her lips never moved, and her eyes never moved. The corpse girl just continued to stare in my direction. I felt hypnotized, sitting there in my car. Then I felt them- cold tongues that drew across my back and chest. The car filled with the smell of sulfur and decay. Then my vision began to turn black, as her voice took over my mind, and I fell into a dreamless sleep.

\*\*\*

“Dad?” I felt little hands pushing on my chest. I opened one eye groggily, forgetting where I was for a few moments. Then I shot up in my seat, adrenaline coursing through my body as I looked around for the corpse girl. “She’s gone, dad. I got rid of her- for now.” I looked down at him, amazed.

“Anthony,” I whispered, looking at him. My head throbbed painfully. “How did you get rid of that *thing*?” I asked. He shrugged.

“I can do weird stuff sometimes,” he said. “Like during my birthday party last year.” I remembered the birthday party clearly. We had a clown who juggled and cartwheeled and did all sorts of tricks for my son and his friends. My son said he could juggle too, and he wanted to show the clown.

He had run into the house, grabbed a few of our knives and started throwing them up in the air. They seemed to slow down as they rose, floating slowly over his head. They fell as if through water, and Anthony grabbed them easily and threw them back up in the air.

“How is he *doing* that?” the clown had asked me, breaking character. I had no idea, and simply stood there, speechless. Then I yelled his name, and the knives had all clattered to the lawn.

“She was strong, and I felt her mind. It was so cold, like an icicle going into my head, but I kept her back by building a wall-” he pointed to the backyard where the corpse of the girl had stood- “and kept her there, dad.” I realized he was not talking about a physical wall, but some sort of mental wall that he made in his mind. I nodded.

“She was trying to take you. I could feel the words that came out of her head and into yours. I heard everything she was saying. And she was *showing* me things. Really bad, really scary things from where she comes from. She told me that, in her home, all the roads are paved with bones of kids like myself, and that the girls like her have their mouths sewn shut, so that they never have to rely on using their mouths to speak. They use their *brains* somehow. The whole place is run by an insane god who lies by this silver stream. She showed me the god, and I felt it looking at me. It was like insects were looking at me, like insects with huge brains and big, dark, scary eyes.” He shuddered. “What kind of god is that, dad?”

“A god we never want to meet, that’s for sure,” I said, tousling his hair, trying to get him to smile. “The god that we believe in is eternal love and light. Whatever that little girl worships, it isn’t God.” Anthony’s eyes continued to look blankly ahead as he recalled what the eldritch girl had shown him. Then they looked up at me sharply.

“I don’t understand that stuff about viruses that she was saying. What’s going on? Are we going to be sick?” he asked, looking so little and helpless in his tiny windbreaker and jeans.

“I don’t know what she was talking about, but we need to get out of here right now. I’m sure we will be fine if we can just get past the borders of the town- at least, I think so. And I also think some sort of biological outbreak is causing people to go insane…”

As if on cue, a car sped past, fire leaping out of the shattered windows. I smelled burning rubber, hot metal and roasting meat, a disgusting combination of aromas that the nightmarish scene left in its wake. The driver hit a tree, flying through the windshield and smashing his burned body into the trunk at an incredible speed. I saw by the awkward angle of his neck that he was either dead or dying. He looked like a bird who had flown into a window, the neck snapped and the head lolling weakly at a 45 degree angle on a totally broken spine. I turned to look at him sharply. “Where’s your mother?”

“In the house,” he said. I took the keys out of the ignition, grabbing Anthony’s small hand and running towards our home of ten years. I kept looking left and right for the corpse girl, but she hadn’t reappeared yet. I wondered if Anthony truly was so powerful that he could scare her away for good. I seriously doubted it. I had a feeling she was biding her time, and probably watching us at this very moment. The thought sent chills down my spine.

As I walked into the entranceway, I started yelling her name, trying to get out of here as soon as possible.

“Margaret?” I screamed. Anthony was next to me, screaming, “Mom! Where are you?” I led him to the kitchen first, where I grabbed a butcher knife, and gave Anthony a smaller but still very sharp knife from the kitchen drawer.

“Don’t stab yourself by accident with it, kiddo,” I said. “Only use it as a last resort.” He nodded. “I wish I had guns here, but we…” At that moment, my words were cut off by a wailing, pain-filled shrieking from upstairs. I took Anthony’s hand, unwilling to be separated from him for any reason now, and kicked open the master bedroom door.

There, I saw our priest, Father Lanagan, with a pistol to my wife’s head. He was very clearly sick, bleeding from his eyes and nose, a waterfall of gore spilling out of his heaving, gasping mouth. I put my hands up.

“Father Lanagan,” I said loudly and simply. “Put down the gun. You’re sick.” He just breathed louder and faster, his gray eyes beginning to film over with milky, blood-smeared cataracts. He reminded me more and more of the corpse girl. Even his stare was similar- an almost reptilian, sadistic glower that looked down on everything and everyone around.

I took a step forward. All of his attention was focused on me. His gun hand shook hard.

“Look, Father, you aren’t like this,” I said. “You can…” But I never got to finish my sentence. At that moment, my son, small and brave, ran through the alternate door to the master bedroom, his small knife raised above his head like a tiny Amazonian warrior.

“Let go of my mommy!” Anthony said, plunging the knife into Father Lanagan’s stomach. The priest howled in pain, and I ran forward, grabbing his gun hand just as he was aiming at my son. I pushed it up with all of my strength, and the shot went high, blowing apart a dresser drawer. I took the knife and shoved it directly through his right eye. His other eye widened in surprise, the bloody tears coming faster for a moment, then he slumped to the floor. My heart racing, I grabbed the gun out of his hand, making sure it wasn’t pointed at my son or wife in case he had the strength to pull the trigger one last time.

And, as it turns out, he did. The last shot went through the window, the tinkling of glass mixing with the ringing in my ears from the gunshots at such a close distance, and then I had the revolver out of his hand, putting it in my back pocket, sighing.

“Let’s get out of this madhouse of a town,” I said to my wife. She just cried and hugged me, putting her face against my shoulder for a few moments. Then we ran outside, grabbing some bottled water and canned foods on the way and throwing them in a plastic bag.

I drove out of there as fast as I could, quickly entering the fields and woods at the edge of town. But just as I was about to cross over into the next town, I found that the road was blocked.

Dozens of bodies were stacked one on top of another, across the road and the sides of the road. There was no possible way around them. Half of them were naked or wearing torn rags, and some of them still twitched and moaned. They were all crying blood, vomiting gore that ran down the group. I pulled over, putting my head against the steering wheel and crying.

I tried calling for help, but no phone calls would connect. The internet still worked, so I wrote up what had happened. In case my family and I don’t make it out of here, I wanted someone to know what really happened in my town.

Sighing in frustration and despair, grabbing the revolver and handing the butcher knife to my wife, we all got out of the car and started walking.
