I’ll come out and say it: I ran with a gang during my teen years. I’m not proud of it. My parents tried their hardest to raise me right despite the neighborhood we lived in, put me through school, but that wasn't enough for me. Every day, I would see guys swaggering around, flashing guns or knives at the slightest provocation, and above all, having respect. See, back then, I always felt like my family didn’t respect me. Amazing how the lens of your teen years can distort things. So I ended up getting with a gang of two other guys, Joe, the brains, and Mark, our leader. I was just the guy who counted our money, took inventory, stuff like that. Looking back, we were nothing but a bunch of try-hard hooligans who thought they were the shit, the next big gang to hit the streets. But I didn't try to leave because of a change of heart or anything like that. That came with age. The traumatic events that led to our gang being dismantled in one night all started with a gunshot.

We had taken the wallet of an old man at gunpoint, or rather, Mark had. There was something odd about the man, though. He just grinned and laughed at us. We just figured he was drunk, crazy, high, or all three. As I began counting out the contents of the wallet, which totaled to $15.36 and a slip of paper with odd writing on it, a loud pop echoed next to me. Blood began running down the man’s ratty old shirt as he slumped against the wall of the building. In shock and confusion, I turned and saw Mark holding his handgun, smoke leaking from the muzzle. 

We didn’t have the time to process what had just happened before Joe exclaimed, “Let’s get outta here!” 

We immediately began running as the man began gurgling something that sounded like gibberish at the time. We didn’t stop until we were at least three blocks away in an old railyard. Once we had caught our breaths sufficiently, Joe stalked up to Mark, then grabbed him by the shirt collar and slammed him against a nearby wall, prompting him to drop the gun. Despite being the brains of our gang, he was deceptively strong.

“What the fuck was that?!” he demanded of Mark, who was shocked by the sudden display of rage. “You were supposed to show him the gun, not shoot him!” 

The weight of what had happened hit us then, or it hit Joe and I. Mark just shrugged carelessly. 

“Shit, Joe, he was just some crazy hobo. Nobody’s gonna—”

“Goddamnit, man, do you know what you’ve done?” he continued, clasping the back of his head and pacing around. “Someone coulda heard that shit! Maybe someone saw it! We’re in deep shit, man!”

Seeing Joe get this stressed and upset was jarring, to say the least. Normally, he was cool and collected, and his smarts had often been what kept us out of jail. When we’d formed this gang, he’d made us swear we wouldn't kill anyone who didn't try to first. Really, Mark was the name and face of our gang, hence him being the only one with a gun. 

Now here was the smartest guy in our gang pacing around in a panic, and our leader acting confused about why everyone was looking so upset. And I was standing there, holding the meager prize that had been paid for in the blood of a strange but harmless man. 

In a daze, I slumped against a wall. I thought I’d seen enough shootings from afar to become desensitized. But seeing someone I knew commit the deed, then act like he’d done nothing wrong… It was almost too much. Then I did it. Maybe our fates had been sealed since we had decided to rob that man, but as I removed the slip of paper, I condemned us. I saw that it contained three names. Ours. Above them was an odd symbol, and it was glowing. Before I could say anything, I felt a burning sensation on my forehead. Joe and Mark, previously busy arguing, cried out in pain as well. The same symbol had appeared on their foreheads. 

I tried to tell them what I had seen, but everything after that happened so fast. Smoke rushed by us, carrying the scent of decay with it. As the smoke gathered in the center of the yard, it gradually took on a solid form. How do I best describe what we saw that night? It looked like a man, but its skin was the color of obsidian, and it had red, glowing eyes and long fingers with black, sharp claws. It was tall and unnaturally thin. If you had told me that I was staring at a demon that night, I would have believed you. We could do nothing but look on in disbelief at first. 

Then its eyes flicked upward, and its lips parted, revealing blackened, sharp teeth in a hideous grin. Mark was the first to snap out of his fearful reverie, and he began bolting in the other direction. With a single step, the creature seemed to warp ahead and reappeared in front of him, holding out its clawed hand and wrapping its ghastly fingers around his throat. It all happened so fast. One moment, he was being lifted in the air, trying to reach for his gun, the next, with a sickening snap, his neck crumpled in its fingers and he went limp. This was followed by the creature tearing his head off of his shoulders, as easy as removing a bottle cap. If only that was the worst part, though. As it inspected the head, Mark’s face gazed at its new owner, impossibly still alive. His mouth tried to scream, tried to beg, but he had no lungs. 

Joe was quicker to act than me, rushing for the gun. He screamed at me to run before he went against his cool demeanor by opening fire on the creature. The bullets struck it, but they just seemed to mildly amuse the beast. Smiling maliciously, it vanished and reappeared again, impaling Joe’s torso and pulling his beating heart out. He stood dumbfounded for a moment as his body caught up with his injury. He slowly turned me, and he tried to gurgle my name before he fell to the ground. I tried to run, but the monster was too fast for me. Still holding my friends’ head and heart in its hands, it gazed down at me as if contemplating what horrors it could inflict. Then its expression changed. No longer did its grin seem malicious, but instead affable. Placing Joe’s heart in its left hand, it reached down. I flinched, but nothing happened. It patted my head in an almost affectionate manner. Somehow I was more disturbed by this than I would have been if it dragged me to Hell. This thing had just murdered my friends, and now it was acting like a kindly, grandfatherly figure. 

Its eyes turned towards the gun and its free hand released my head, taking the wallet before it immediately caught on fire. It wagged its index finger at me in a warning gesture, then took Joe’s heart, before their bodies rose up and began sluggishly following it like marionettes operated by an inebriated puppeteer. Then, just like that, they vanished.

No investigation was launched regarding the death of the old man or the disappearance of my friends. I went back to school, managed to graduate, and eventually got a job. I stayed in the city I had grown up in, and I quit having anything to do with gang life, with one exception. You see, the symbol placed on our foreheads has stayed with me all these years. Just last night, I heard a pop outside my apartment building, and the symbol began to burn. I looked outside the living room window, and I saw a group of young men running away from a dead body in an alley. Within seconds, I saw a gangly, red-eyed figure emerge from the shadows and stare at them as they ran toward the derelict railyard. It then turned its head up to meet my gaze, and despite the distance between us, I could see it smile, then raise its finger to its lips in a mocking “Shh” gesture. 

Maybe we got what we deserved that night. Maybe even though I hadn't directly participated in the murder, it decided I should still be punished by being forced to watch helplessly as it sadistically hunted down young gangsters like us. I know this is a punishment because I could have stepped in and prevented Mark from pulling the trigger, but I didn’t. Each time I see it, I see little “snapshots” of its new acts in my head, hear the screams of the teens it kills, and sometimes, it gives me a front-row seat, letting me “feel” the sensation of holding someone’s decapitated head as it lets out silent cries for mercy. And sometimes, unbidden, I feel my lips curl into a painful smile.
