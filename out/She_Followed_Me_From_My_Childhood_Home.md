When I was a kid, I punched through a wall in my childhood bedroom. I didn’t remember doing it, and insisted I hadn’t, and tried to prove this because there was blood on the broken drywall and none on my hands. My parents didn’t believe me. My father patched up the hole, though poorly, and the spackle left an odd-looking ripple pattern.

I felt something strange when I looked at that ripple in the wall. It was a nameless, seething rage. I had to cover it with posters, or a shelf when I was a teen, just to feel at peace. I’m twenty-five now and have long since moved out of my parents’ house in the country. I had no reason to go back. The city had my university and later my job, and all my childhood town did was descend into poverty.

A few years ago, having sworn off roommates, I moved alone into a high-rise with my dog. One day, out of boredom and curiosity, I started researching my childhood home and stumbled across a website with a rather uncreative name  - [www.diedinhouse.com](http://www.diedinhouse.com/) \- that would tell you if someone had died in your house. I put in my childhood address and paid the fee.

Someone had died. And it had happened right before we moved in. Within a few minutes of intense googling, I found a newspaper article that fit the neighborhood and year of death. It seemed the family who lived in that house before us had killed their foster daughter – sad, but not as uncommon as you’d think. I called my mother.

She already knew. This upset me because I feel like someone being murdered in your house is kind of important, you know? She said she hadn’t wanted to scare me. My parents were poor when I was little, so buying a highly discounted house was a dream come true for them, even if the discount was because someone was killed there.

As she told me what she knew, it made sense. This was why there were cameras in my room when we moved in, which my mother quickly took down. This was why my windows were nailed shut, and with so many nails we could never get them all out. This was why there was that odd smell in the carpet we could never afford to replace, and the smell of must and decay in the walls.

My childhood bedroom was the murdered girl’s bedroom. My bedroom was where she had been trapped for days, starved, killed, and then left to rot. Her last attempt to escape was to break through the wall, but she wasn’t strong enough to get all the way through.

When we got off the phone, I felt sick. My dog, who was also my childhood dog, came up to me to comfort me. I should note that strange things tend to happen around my family. Maybe it’s because we buy houses where people have been murdered - big surprise - but I assumed I had escaped all that by moving to the city. But three nights later, I woke up around 4:00 a.m. to my dog barking at the wall.

She had barked at random things before - chairs, my piano, even me from a distance, but she was senile and blind so I didn’t take it seriously. But she had never barked at night, and the only other wall she had barked at was the wall I’d punched through as a kid in my childhood bedroom.

“What is it, girl?” I asked, groggily working my way out of bed to comfort her.

I turned my light on, and beside my bed was another hole in the wall, the size of a fist. Blood was streaked around it, but my hands weren’t bleeding, just like in my childhood bedroom.

This happened about two years ago. Some things are never meant to be understood, but since then, I’ve had time to think about what happened and why. I believe the girl’s spirit had attached to me. Maybe she saw in me the childhood she wished she had, or maybe she was living vicariously through me as I grew up like she was never able to. Whatever the case, I didn’t leave her in that home.

I sense her often when I’m alone, and I feel that same nameless, seething rage I did all those years ago when I looked at the ripple in the wall she couldn't escape from.
