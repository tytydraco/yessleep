when we’re young we do stupid things, probably because we haven’t yet experienced the consequences. For me i would live with the consequences for the rest of my life.

when i was younger i didn’t have many friends, i mean i wasn’t disliked i just was never part of any friend groups. Because of this i had to resort to the ones none wanted to talk to, the creepy kids. At first they were very welcoming but i would soon realise i would have to prove myself to them.

I never really believed in spirits or demons or anything, like when i heard people did believe in them as a kid i would silently chuckle in my head. There wasn’t any prove worthy evidence of it anyway, whats the harm? i thought. sadly, i was gravely mistaken.

One day i was invited over to one of the creepy kids house’s for a sleepover, the whole friend group was invited too so i wasn’t worried. my mam dropped me to her house and said goodbye. As soon as i was greeted by her father, i felt a dark aura. i knew something was wrong, i just couldn’t put my finger on what or.. who.

i tried to ignore the scared feelings i had and decided to try enjoy the night. we all set up our blankets and pillows on the floor and after we played some games. It was going good, I was having fun. Later on we had all settled down for bed, her dad told all of us where the bathroom was and other things like the kitchen for water or where his bedroom was incase something happened , after he said goodnight he turned off the light and went upstairs to his room. 

“this is where the fun starts” said one of the girls. Safe to say i was intrigued.
Before i even had time to think all the girls shoved me into the bathroom and turned off the light. It was so dark in there but then again i didn’t believe in myths and spooky things so if anything, i was mad they just shoved me in the bathroom.

They told me that they wouldn’t let me leave until i said bloody mary 3x. I immediately did it without thinking,
i wanted to get out of the bathroom 
and be liked by the girls. i said it in the mirror and as soon as i finished saying it, the mirror broke. I screamed i managed to push the door open. 

None was there, the whole house was empty. I was really scared and tried to call my mom to pick me up. I had no service, when i found that out i fainted.

when i awoke i was in a hospital bed. What? why am i here?? what happened?
i looked up and saw my mom by my bedside. my mom was asleep. my wrists hurt so i looked down and all of my arms were cut up. It looked like self harm but i don’t remember ever doing that to myself. a doctor was walking by and when he saw i was awake he sped up to me.

“you’re probably confused” he said.
