After travelling for almost 800 kms from Delhi, I reached the religious capital of India. The city of Varanasi. There's a century old story that once Maa Parvati ( wife of the diety Shiva ) lost a bangle in the River Ganges. Unable to find it, she cursed the Manikarnika ghat on the banks of Ganges with everlasting death pyres. It is said that since then this particular ghat was under the influence of a strong curse that brings misfortunes to those who interfere with the sacred rites.

I could instantly feel a heavyness in my throat and the weight of century old rituals in this city. It was the last day of Shivratri ( a Hindu festival celebrated in the honour of Lord Shiva ) and the streets were bustling with devotees. The chats of " Har Har Mahadev " and the smell of burning incense and flickering pot lamps made the city felt alive.

Making my way through some old alleyways and crowded roads, I finally reached the sacred river of Ganges. The riverfront steps ( the Ghats ) were lined with pilgrims offering prayers to Lord Shiva, the river came alive with floating diyas and people travelling in old wooden boats. At some distance I could see pyres, hundreds of them being prepared as the final resting place for hundreds of bodies and some of them were burning. Despite all the celebrations, the sight of the pyres unsettled me as I moved through the crowd. A strange undercurrent, a brief tension filled the air as I moved closer to the Manikarnika Ghat.

Finding solace from the noise of the city, I decided to sit and spend some time on the very edge of the Manikarnika Ghat. Introspecting as I looked at the burning pyre I couldn't help but feel the weight of mortality pressing down upon me. The river lapped softly at the shore, and it stretched out before me, silent and empty. That's when it happened, a faint, silent almost incomprehensible rise and fall of the steps beneath me as if the stairs breathed. A cold breeze gushed against my face. I paused looking at the burning pyre and turned sharply to look at the dark, mist shrouded river. Where did all the floating diyas go? I quickly looked at my phone and it was 3:03 AM in the morning. Just how long was I sitting there? This felt wrong..very wrong. I had no sense of time for the past 7 hours? How was this possible? Just as I was questioning my thoughts it happened again.

The stones - shifted, as if they had a pulse, like lungs taking in shallow breaths. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and for the first time I noticed it - the whispers, the faint whispers in the air. At first it sounded like the rustling of the river, but as I listened longer they became more tangible, as if the river itself was speaking to me. The words felt ancient, incomprehensible yet they filled a deep, primal fear within me, a fear that the very earth beneath me was alive. I quickly stood up to leave the place but the stones beneath my feet rippled fanatically, the whispers became a defeaning chorus, my legs froze in place against my will and my body trembled as the air grew thick with an unnatural force. In the distance, from the depths of the river - I caught a glimpse of it, It's eyes...EYES that didn't belong to this world. It's shape so vast, so incomprehensible that my mind refused to register it's form. It's presence felt ancient, as if it existed before the river, the city. 

My vision blurred, darkness creeping in at the edges as the whispers wrap my throat, suffocating me. My mind flashed back to the smoke from the burning pyre, twisting and rising into the night sky, like a soul being torn from this world. It haunted me now, the fleeting nature of it, the vanishing into the void. I realised with a sickening clarity that this was how my life was going to end. Like smoke disappearing into nothingness. 

I accepted my fate just as the stones beneath me shuddered again, when something unexpected happened, the air cackled with energy behind me as if something far more older, protective was behind me. I couldn't see it, but I could feel it. The eyes in the water flickered with what I could only describe as fear. And in a moment, everything was gone. Whatever had saved me was gone. Whatever was beneath the ghats disappeared. I collapsed to the ground, no longer feeling the weight of the darkness, or the suffocation of whispers around my throat.

I quickly ascended the steps running back to the streets with my heart pounding in my chest, my body drenched in cold sweat. The Manikarnika Ghat was behind me now, but the unease lingered.

Even now, as I sit here, writing this - the memories of the smoke, the eyes, the divine intervention continues to haunt me.
