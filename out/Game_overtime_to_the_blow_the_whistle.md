My fingers are shaking bad right now, real bad...

But I gotta get this out because the walls are closing in. 

I'm already fucked. I don't want you to be. Maybe it's too late already.

They're pounding on the door now––I've got it closed, barricaded, but they'll cut it down, just a matter of time––

Okay, fuck it, back to what happened...

The chief science officer of the lab, Wilkins––she saw it before the rest of us. Hit the big red STOP button just in time. 

Electromagnetic pulse, boom, all the nanomachines––tick-like clusters, billions of the things rolled into singular masses––dead. 

Unmoving mulch on the bottom of the holding tank, like the  shit you spread over bare spots in the yard in spring, the stuff you water that expands to 10x its size.

*Dead.* But are they really? The nanomachines we've been developing? For now, this batch, at least. But the experiment isn't going to just stop here. Too much money wrapped up in it, billions and billions. Trillions. The kind of money that makes Sam Bankman-Fried's evaporated fortune look like change in a beggar's cup.

Too much R&D––scientists and corporate fat cats playing god, thinking they're in control. 

All it takes is one crack in the glass, one broken seam, one tear in the protective suit...

Like what happened to Ellis, which is how we knew something was wrong.

*"It stings––"* that's what he started saying. He'd been drawing a sample from the tank...

Millions of the microscopic machines poured through the tear in his suit. A gray, gangrenous blanket. Unstitching his skin, which sloughed off, filling up his suit...

I thought about Ellis's kids while I watched him die. Horror on his face, realization that it was over. I thought about his wife. About the company picnic a month ago, drinking root beer floats together, all smiles. 

The company won't tell his family how he died. Maybe they'll make them forget.

Weyland-Yutani motherfuckers. Tech bastards are no different. Alien and Aliens and Alien 3 were auto-fucking-biographical.

Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk don't care about you or me or anyone else, they don't care about the Ellis's of the world who are nothing more than collateral for their ambition.

Ellis. The nanomachines. The tear in his suit––

I can't scrub it from my mind, and each time the tape plays back, the deeper it burrows––

Revulsion, terror, and a fundamental understanding that I'm powerless to stop any of it, save for writing this––

Ellis. Eaten alive by microscopic things that know nothing better than to eat. Thick liquid, skin and bone and muscle, *mulched*. The legs of his suit looked like a plastic bag filled with lumpy porridge. His eyes went wide before the things ate through his organs.

He'd moved to hit the red button, but his leg broke under his weight, the nanomachines already having burrowed through the marrow.

That's when Wilkins moved in, our CSO. Brilliant woman, dangerous obsession with understanding what we aren't meant to understand...

Just in time. Ellis was goop, but the rest of us made it––

...more pounding on the door now, they just started up a saw of some kind, they're getting ready to cut through the metal...

The sparks are falling, a rain of fire, the screeching sound of metal saw teeth biting through the metal door, my concentration is slipping away from me, but here I am, blowing the whistle because no one else will.

No referees. No one managing the game. No one regulating what happens.

None of us are safe. While they play god, while we work for their companies, they go rogue behind closed doors, like they did in the lab where Ellis is probably seeping through the grated floor by now

All it takes is one crack in the glass, one broken seam, one tear in the protective suit...

And there are more faults in the system than you might think.

One piece of the jenga tower gets pulled, the whole thing will come tumbling down.

Go to your company parties. Drink your root beer floats. Feel the sunshine on your skin.

Don't take it for granted, because sooner than later, it will be game over over.

Maybe this is the last good thing I do. They're almost through the door now. But this message will get through the firewall because a fucking ace with computers––

Vent––air vent. Overhead, in the corner. I'm going to try to climb through. Will stay in touch if I can. But now I'm hitting send. 

Go to sleep tonight knowing how fucked we all are. I hope you have nightmares. 

Don't sign up for Prime. Don't fund these bastards. Don't buy fairy-dust ETH or FTT or whatever the fuck else, because they're playing with fire, and we're giving them gallons upon gallons of fuel––

More sparks falling from the severed door, they're almost through...

Makes me think of a spark hitting a spreading puddle of gas, an out of control technology industry with no regulation, no one stopping them, no checks and balances despite the efforts of an honest few––

The world will burn by the time they're finished.

Whistle blown. Game over––

Maybe it doesn't have to be. Your move.

I'm out through that vent in the wall if I can fit through. If they don't catch me first––

Now, it's your move.
