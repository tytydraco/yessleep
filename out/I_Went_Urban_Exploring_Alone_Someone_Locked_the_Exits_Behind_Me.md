I am writing this on my phone with my left hand because my right one is wrapped in gauze and taped to a splint.

If you’re going to comment “don’t trespass,” save it. I already learned that part. I learned it with blood on a concrete floor and someone close enough behind me that I could smell cigarettes through my own panic.

I’m seventeen. I live in a town where nothing happens unless it’s the kind of nothing that ruins your week. My friends and I watch those urban exploring videos where people wander through dead malls and old factories and it looks quiet. Dusty. Empty. Sad.

This was not like that.

I went alone because I’m an idiot, and because my friends are all talk. “Yeah bro I’m down,” and then it’s “my mom said no” or “I got work.” I told myself I’d just go in, take a few pictures, and leave before midnight. I told myself I’d be smart.

I picked the Hollis Distribution Center because everyone in town knows it. Huge gray warehouse off the service road behind the old strip mall. When I was little, trucks were always coming and going. My dad used to point at it and say, “That’s where all your Christmas stuff sits before it gets delivered.”

It shut down last year. They chained the gates and put up No Trespassing signs that faded in the sun. People started saying it was empty, then people started saying kids were going in to tag it, then people started saying they heard generators at night.

That last part should have been my warning.

I parked at the back of the strip mall like I was going to the late movie, even though the theater has been closed for years. I took my backpack, my cheap headlamp, a flashlight, and my phone. I wore gloves because of broken glass and I felt stupid the whole time. Like I was dressing up as someone brave.

The service road was cracked and littered with shredded tire pieces. I could see the warehouse over the weeds, a long wall with loading bay doors like sealed mouths. No lights inside. No movement.

I found an opening at the far end where the chain link fence had been cut and bent back. Not ripped by a storm. Cut clean, like someone used tools and did it on purpose.

My stomach did that quick dip. The part of my brain that still works said go home.

Then the other part said it’s just other explorers.

I slipped through and walked along the wall, keeping my light off. The air smelled like wet cardboard and old oil. Somewhere, a loose metal sign clinked softly in the wind.

There was a side door, steel, with a push bar. It had a fresh scrape near the handle, shiny where paint had been rubbed off. I pushed.

It opened without resistance.

Inside, my phone didn’t “fade” to no service. It just flipped to SOS and then to nothing, like the building swallowed it. I told myself it was the thick concrete and all the metal. Warehouses are dead zones. I’ve lost signal in my own school stairwell.

Still, the timing made my skin prickle.

The silence hit right after, big and flat.

The first room was an office area with glass panes and dusty desks. Someone had smashed a window and the glass had been swept into a neat pile in the corner. Not scattered. Not random. A neat pile, like whoever did it didn’t want to step on it.

There was a smell in there too. Not mold. Something sharper. Warmed plastic, and a faint tang like exhaust that didn’t belong in a room that was supposed to be cold and dead.

I moved deeper, past the office, into the main floor.

The warehouse opened up like an airplane hangar. Rows of empty shelving reached into the dark. Conveyor belts ran overhead, frozen in mid-motion, their rollers dull with dust. Yellow safety lines were painted on the concrete, worn from years of forklifts.

My flashlight caught a sign on a pillar about required PPE and forklift traffic. The kind of sign you don’t even see when you’re working because it’s just there.

Then I saw fresh boot prints.

Near a side entrance where mud had dried in a streak, there were clear treads. Wide heel. Recent enough that the mud was still darker than the concrete around it.

I stopped and listened.

Nothing.

Then, far off, something clicked.

Not the random pop of a settling building. A deliberate click, like a switch.

I whispered, “Hello?” which was the dumbest thing I could have done because it told whoever was in there that I was real and I was alone.

No answer.

I kept walking anyway, slower, trying to find the obvious “people hang out here” spot. That’s what those videos always show. Spray paint cans. A mattress. Beer bottles.

I found something worse.

Near the center of the building, under one of the conveyor lines, there was a folding chair facing a blank wall. Just one chair, centered like it was placed for a reason. On the floor in front of it were three chalk marks in a little triangle, like someone had been measuring distance.

On the chair was a cheap set of ear protection, the kind you’d wear around loud machinery.

My throat tightened.

I backed up without thinking, my heel scraping concrete.

From somewhere in the dark, a sound answered my scrape. A soft shuffle. One step. Then stillness.

I killed my flashlight and froze.

Total dark.

I listened so hard my ears hurt.

Breathing. My own. Too loud.

Then I heard it again.

Another step.

Closer.

I turned my flashlight back on and swung it across the aisles, trying to catch movement.

Nothing.

But the feeling changed. The warehouse didn’t feel empty anymore. It felt occupied. Like the air had shifted around a body.

I started walking back the way I came, fast but trying not to run. Running in a warehouse is how you fall into a hole or hit your head and nobody finds you.

I passed the office again and aimed for the side door.

The door was closed.

It had been open. I knew it had. I could still picture the push bar.

Now it was shut, and the thin gap of light under it was gone.

I reached for it, pulled, and the door didn’t budge.

Locked.

My hand went numb around the handle.

I tugged harder. Nothing.

I put my shoulder into it. Metal rang. Still nothing.

That was the moment the fear got simple. Not creepy fear. Survival fear.

Someone is in here with me, and they can lock doors.

I turned, scanning the office. There was a security desk near the hallway that led deeper into the building. On the desk was a clipboard with a paper that said VISITOR LOG at the top. It looked old, but the pen beside it didn’t. The pen was clean, like it had been placed that day.

I don’t know why I did it. My hands were shaking and I wanted them to do something that wasn’t yanking on a locked door.

I wrote my first name on the log. Just “Eli,” and the time. I didn’t even think. I wrote it like a joke, like I could laugh later about signing into a dead building.

The ink looked too dark on the page, too fresh.

I regretted it immediately.

I went down the hallway instead, trying to find another exit.

At the end of the hall was a stairwell door. I pushed it open.

Cold air hit my face. The stairwell smelled like wet cement and rust. Metal stairs went up to a second level, probably a maintenance mezzanine.

I stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind me.

The latch clicked.

Then, behind it, I heard a soft tap.

Knuckle on metal.

Once.

Then again, slow.

Tap.

Tap.

Not banging. Not trying to break in. Just letting me know they were there.

I backed up a step onto the stairs.

Tap.

Tap.

The tapping stopped.

A few seconds of nothing.

Then I heard the latch move on the other side. A quiet sliding sound.

The door handle turned.

It didn’t open. But it turned, like someone was testing it.

Then, very softly, a voice said from the other side, “You lost?”

It wasn’t a monster voice. It wasn’t a whispery ghost voice. It was a normal adult voice, calm and almost bored.

That terrified me more than anything.

I didn’t answer.

The voice sighed like I was inconveniencing them.

“Wrong place to be,” it said. “Come on. Let’s get you out.”

The words sounded helpful. The tone didn’t.

I backed up another step. My shoe scraped metal.

Silence.

I started up the stairs, faster now. The metal clanged under my feet. I hated every sound I made but I couldn’t stop.

Halfway up, the stairwell lights came on.

Not full bright. A flicker, then steady industrial glow. The kind you get when power comes to a place that’s supposed to be dead.

I froze, staring up at the fixture. Dust drifted through the light like slow snow.

Below me, the stairwell door clicked open.

I did not look back. I ran up the rest of the stairs and pulled myself onto the upper landing.

The upper level was a long catwalk running along the inside wall of the warehouse. Grated metal floor. Safety rail. From up there I could see almost everything below. Shelving rows. Conveyor belts. The chair.

And now I could see the generator.

A small portable generator sat tucked behind a stack of pallets near the far wall. The little fuel cap glinted in my beam. A heavy extension cord ran from it into a junction box. Someone had taped a label on the box with a strip of white tape and black marker. It said “LIGHTS / PA.”

My stomach dropped again.

Whoever was here didn’t just sneak in. They set up power on purpose. They planned to turn the building on when they wanted.

I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me.

Slow. Patient.

Like the person wasn’t worried about catching me because they already knew where I could and couldn’t go.

I moved along the catwalk, flashlight sweeping for a way down. There was a ladder in the distance, and a second stairwell on the far side.

I chose the ladder because it was closer.

My hands shook as I ran. The grate under my shoes made a hollow clatter. The warehouse threw the sound back at me.

The footsteps behind me stayed steady.

Not sprinting.

Just following.

I reached the ladder and started down. It was bolted to the wall and dropped to the floor near a row of shelving.

I was halfway down when something hit the catwalk above me.

A heavy thud, like a boot kicked the metal.

The ladder vibrated. My hands slipped.

I climbed faster. My glove caught on a sharp edge and tore. My bare palm scraped metal and pain flared.

I dropped the last few feet instead of climbing properly. My feet hit concrete hard. I stumbled forward, catching myself by slamming my shoulder into a shelf upright.

Above me, on the catwalk, a figure leaned on the rail and watched.

I only saw them for a second in my flashlight beam. Adult. Dark jacket. A headlamp on their forehead, but it was off. Face kept in shadow.

They didn’t yell. They didn’t threaten me.

They raised one hand, slow, and pointed toward the aisle in front of me like they were directing traffic.

I ran.

I wove between shelving, trying to use the rows like cover. I kept expecting them to jump down and chase me, but the footsteps stayed above for a bit, tracking, then stopped.

I couldn’t tell if that was good or worse.

I found a side exit door near one of the loading bays. It had a panic bar and a chain looped through the handles from the inside.

Not a normal chain. A thick one, like someone brought it from home. The padlock looked new, shiny, almost proud of itself.

I yanked the door anyway. The chain held.

I turned and looked for another way out, and that’s when the lights cut out.

Not gradually. Off.

Darkness snapped back in.

My flashlight was still on, but the warehouse swallowed the beam. Everything beyond a few yards was black.

Then the PA system crackled overhead.

A speaker popped and hissed, then a voice came through, slightly distorted.

A recording at first.

“Hello?”

Pause.

Then it said, “Eli.”

My knees went watery.

The name came again, clearer.

“Eli.”

I felt my stomach turn cold, because I knew exactly how it happened. I could see the clipboard. The pen. My own handwriting.

The calm voice returned, live this time.

“I told you it’s the wrong place,” it said. “Now you’re making noise. People hear noise.”

I spun in a slow circle, trying to see where the voice came from. It could have been anywhere.

My flashlight beam caught something hanging from a shelf upright.

A strip of reflective tape. Bright orange.

Then another on the next upright. And the next.

A path.

A line of orange markers, spaced just far enough apart to pull your eyes along the aisle.

The voice on the PA said, “Follow the tape. You’ll get out.”

It sounded like a test.

It sounded like a trap.

I did not follow the tape.

I turned and ran in the opposite direction.

That decision probably saved my life and it also got me hurt.

I sprinted down an aisle, cut left, then right, trying to head back toward the office windows. I figured even if the door was locked, I could break glass and crawl out. I didn’t care about trespassing charges anymore. I cared about daylight and people.

My flashlight beam bounced. Shadows jumped. Shelf columns turned into bodies for a split second and then steel again.

Then my foot caught something low across the floor.

I didn’t see it until it hit my shin.

It wasn’t a wire. It was a strap, like a ratchet strap laid across the aisle at ankle height, pulled tight.

My legs went out from under me.

I hit the concrete hard, shoulder first, then my face. My teeth clacked together so hard I thought one cracked.

My flashlight flew and spun, painting circles across the shelves.

Before I could scramble up, something heavy landed on my backpack and pinned it.

Not a boot on my spine. Not a knee on my neck. Just enough weight to trap me in place.

I bucked and twisted, trying to get free, and that’s when my right hand slid across something sharp.

Pain ripped through my palm. Real, hot pain.

Glass.

Someone had scattered broken glass right where you’d catch yourself.

I jerked my hand back and saw blood immediately, bright in the flashlight beam.

I tried to close my fingers. They didn’t listen right away.

Above me, the calm voice spoke, not through the PA this time.

Right behind my head.

“You really should’ve followed the tape.”

I couldn’t see him. My face was pressed to the floor. The flashlight was angled wrong. I could only see his shadow stretching across the concrete.

He didn’t sound excited. He sounded mildly annoyed, like I made his night harder.

I kicked backward. My heel hit something, maybe his shin, because the weight on my backpack shifted.

That tiny shift was all I needed. I yanked my arm free of the straps, crawled out of my backpack like I was shedding it, grabbed my flashlight, and ran one-handed.

Blood ran down my wrist into my glove. My hand throbbed in time with my heartbeat.

The PA system crackled again, and the live voice said, “Now you’re bleeding in my building.”

Like I owed him an apology.

I ran toward the office area, following memory, not tape. I could taste metal in my mouth. My ankle burned from the fall, but I couldn’t slow down.

I shoved through the office and saw the glass panes.

I raised my flashlight like a hammer and swung. The glass spiderwebbed but didn’t fall.

Safety glass.

Of course it was safety glass.

Footsteps hit the office threshold behind me, closer now.

I grabbed a chair and swung it into the glass again.

This time it shattered outward in thick chunks. The noise was insane in the small space.

Cold air rushed in.

I climbed up using my left hand and shoved my injured right through anyway because there was no other option. The broken edge tore my sleeve.

I dropped outside, landing wrong. My ankle rolled and pain shot up my leg. I almost went down again.

Behind me, the window popped as someone climbed through.

I ran anyway. I limped-run toward the bent fence opening, one hand clamped over my palm, leaving wet prints on my forearm.

Behind me, the calm voice called out, almost casually, “Eli.”

Not yelling. Not panicking. Calling like you call a dog that slipped its leash.

I got through the fence, scraping my back on the chain link. I didn’t care.

I hit the service road and stumbled toward the strip mall lights. My car was a dark shape at the far end. I fumbled the keys with my left hand and nearly dropped them twice.

I got inside and locked the doors so fast my fingers cramped.

For a second I just sat there, panting, staring at the warehouse in the distance.

Nothing moved.

No flashlight beam chased me across the road.

It was like the building swallowed him again.

I drove straight to the hospital. I didn’t stop. I didn’t call my friends. I didn’t call my mom until I was sitting under fluorescent lights with a paper wristband on and a nurse telling me not to look.

The waiting room smelled like coffee and antiseptic. A kid across from me had an ice pack pressed to his forehead and was trying not to cry. The TV was on a news channel with the volume down. Every few minutes a triage door opened and that same bright smell of disinfectant rolled out.

They cleaned my hand. The cut was deep enough that they asked me to try to curl my fingers and then looked at each other when my ring finger didn’t move right away. They numbed it and stitched it anyway. The numbing shot burned like fire for two seconds and then my palm felt huge and distant, like it belonged to someone else. They wrapped it tight and put my hand in a splint.

They X-rayed my ankle. Not broken, but bad enough that they wrapped it and handed me crutches.

While I sat there, still shaking, my phone buzzed.

A message request on an app I barely use anymore.

No profile picture. No name.

Just one line.

“You forgot something.”

That was it. No details. No proof. No photo.

It should have been nothing.

It made me feel sick anyway.

The police took a report. My mom was furious in the way people get when they’re scared and don’t know what else to do with it. The officer asked if I saw his face. I didn’t. I told them about the generator, the orange tape, the strap, the PA system, the chained doors.

I told them I signed the visitor log like an idiot.

The officer wrote it down and looked at me like he wanted it to fit into a neat box.

Trespasser. Squatter. Scrapper.

But those words don’t explain the tape path. They don’t explain the labeled junction box. They don’t explain the way he spoke to me like this was routine.

Two days later my friend drove past the warehouse in daylight, just to see if anything looked different.

He sent me pictures.

The cut fence had been fixed. Not patched. Replaced. New chain link, new ties, straight as a ruler. The side door I used was painted over, fresh gray paint like someone cared about the place suddenly. The No Trespassing signs were new too, crisp, with a phone number for a property management company.

There was also a new camera bubble mounted above the corner of the office wing, like the kind you see outside grocery stores. Maybe it was always there and I never noticed. Maybe it wasn’t.

My friend called the number out of curiosity. It went to a voicemail box that wasn’t set up.

Maybe it was just a guy who didn’t want kids in his building. Maybe it was someone running something illegal and I got too close.

I can live with that explanation, even if it makes my stomach turn.

What I can’t stop thinking about is how fast it all tightened around me.

I handed over my name because I wanted to pretend I wasn’t scared. And he used it like a leash.

So if you’re a kid like me and you see an “abandoned” building and you think it’s just a place to take pictures, listen.

If the glass is swept. If the doors lock from the inside. If the lights come on when you didn’t touch a thing.

Leave.

And if someone offers to “help you out” in a voice that’s too calm, do not answer.

Get out before they learn anything they can repeat back to you.
