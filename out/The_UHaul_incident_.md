As the title implies I work at U-Haul. My job consists of working behind the counter, doing paperwork, inspecting the U-Haul vehicles and of course sweeping and cleaning the front and back when the renters return the vehicles. It’s an alright job I mean it’s simple enough and pays the bills for right now as I’m studying in college. 

The stock of vehicles we have constantly change as people will rent a vehicle at our location and move far away and return it at their new closest location and the same thing goes for people moving near our location. Sometimes it’s people just moving across the city so they’ll return to the same location but mostly we never see the renter again after. 

Anyways I’m rambling here. Cleaning out these things you’ll see some weird shit people leave behind. Some valuable stuff like the nightstand in my room right now that whoever had it last decided they didn’t want anymore. Another time I found a used condom in the back (what the fuck). Also I’ve found some illegal things such as bags of coke, meth, heroin, and pills. Our city has a huge drug problem but I digress. I just throw them away and shake my head it comes with the job. 

Nothing that I’ve seen or cleaned up over the years could’ve ever prepared me for what I saw yesterday though. It was around 5pm almost time for me to leave and go home so I could shower eat and go to my night class when my manger tells me we got one last truck for me to clean out and I’m free to go after that. I grab my cleaning supplies, some gloves, a broom and I walk out to quickly get this over with so I can leave. This was our biggest truck the 26 foot one so this would be around 30 minute to clean. Walking up to the truck I can smell an insane odor coming from it and I was standing 25 feet back at this point.

“What the fuck dude. I’m not doing this shit alone.”

I went back inside and grabbed my manger to bring him out and see this for himself. I grabbed a mask for me and him and we went outside to open this thing up and see what the fuck could possibly be causing this smell. As we were walking up he said “man it smells like a coyote or something got in the back and died.” “Oh great just what I wanted to deal with today.” I rolled my eyes and opened up the back.

Now what we saw when I opened up the back will forever stick with me and I’ll try to describe it to my best abilities. What was in there was 5 bodies naked and torn to shreds. Some were cut in half at the torso others looked like they were crushed and completely flattened. All of them had their heads cut off and rolling around in front of their bodies. All around where their entrails and other organs strung up hanging from the ceiling like Christmas lights and blood covered the entirety of the walls, floor and ceiling. By the heads of the victims I could tell that it was 4 women and 1 man. At this point I’m throwing up and crying at this scene in front of me. Somehow this got even worse though as in the way back of the truck was a muffled crying noise. When I peered under the entrails that obstructed the view of the back it was revealed that a woman was hanging from chains naked with her body cut in half from the waist and intestines hanging below her. Her mouth was taped and she looked me in the eyes right before I saw the light in her eyes go out and I knew she was dead.

My manger stood there completely in shock not moving a muscle. I ran back inside crying in absolute hysterics and gagging wanting to throw up more but had nothing left inside me. My manger followed me back in called the police and sat down at his desk wide eyed staring at the wall not saying a word until the police arrived and brought us separately to the station for questioning. From what I know from an update I just got an hour ago from the police is that the victims are missing people all from areas around an hour outside of our city. The date of these people going missing range from a few months ago to a week ago. One thing remains is that they were all killed at the same time which would have been 2 days before my manger and I stumbled upon them. They asked for records of the truck. When it was last rented and where it came from so I’m bringing them that paperwork now as we didn’t have it in our office at the time. Now the craziest part about all this is that that truck is brand new and hasn’t been rented to anyone in our area yet.
