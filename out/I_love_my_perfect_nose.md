“You have quite the nose, young woman,” some guy catcalls as he passes me on the street. I take note, honored that he thought I was a young woman. 

My therapist told me to write down my thoughts so that’s what I am doing.

I partly got offended. It enrages me when these men in blue uniforms critique a woman’s natural beauty. I constantly see them and despise their snarky remarks.

Sure, my nose is wonderful. But what about my brunette, matted hair with blonde highlights? Or my silky — yet shaggy — pink princess dress? What about my crooked, crescent smile with shiny yellow pearls? 

I do like my nose quite a bit. Its perky edges and button-like features make it stand out. I think my brown eyes, gleaming with a partial sparkle, would have been a more suitable compliment. 

My small nose sits on my face like decoration, useless but pretty. The woody and fresh scent of a newly cracked book; the strange, synthetic tang of a freshly unsealed can of tennis balls; the smoky-sweet perfume of firewood curling through a summer night — all of them drift past me, untouched.

At least I don’t smell the bad: the mildew’s damp, suffocating sensation; the sour stench of my wet dogs after a bath; the metallic, soul-spilling scent rising as I impale someone with a long, rusted rod in the rotting shed behind my house — the dogs watching, silent, mortified.

Unfortunately, I can’t smell fear — that and the glue. At least I have a nice, smooth nose. And when I look into the mirror I remember every person and honor their contribution.

I am happy that so many people comment on my nose. Their compliments give me purpose. A reason to keep doing what I am doing.

I’m happy the guy likes my nose. I’m sure he’ll be the perfect addition.

Looks like I’m back to this! Hopefully I don’t forget about this thing again.

The summer heat really made me clear out most of my closet in search of some gorilla glue. I’m sweating more and more and am unsure how much longer my nose will stay on my face. Hopefully I will find it soon.

I found the glue yesterday!

This journal really makes me reminisce about Dr. Gordon. Every now and then I miss our meetings and wonder how he’s doing.

Every thought that started that way leaves me chuckling. How could I forget? He’s on my face — he’s a part of me now.

The gorilla glue is too strong. My nose is rubbing against my skin, burning it. I need to take my nose off, I hope it doesn’t hurt. 

It’s now peeling off like string cheese, but it’s weird. Parts are clumping together and, well, I think my nose is now part of me. 

I’ve been pulling for hours and some finally came off. Some of the skin between my mouth and eyes were ripped off in the process. At least I can finally smell. I smell the rotting flesh that grafted on top of my real nose for months, maybe even years. 

I smell the metallic blood pouring down my face, even getting a small taste of the blood dripping over my lips. 

I don’t know who I am without my nose.
