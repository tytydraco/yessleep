I don't know how long the pair of us stood there staring at the door, listening to the knocking, and the barely heard voice that whispered. I think, maybe, each one of us - those of us still able to listen and focus - heard something different in those whispers. Me? I heard an offer, a choice. My name, my \*self\* and I wouldn't have to be afraid anymore, I wouldn't have to hurt anymore. I could be at peace.

I knew that was a lie though, Adam - that was his name, the man that had pulled me in here - confirmed those suspicions when I told him what it was whispering.

"There's no peace in oblivion, you'd have to exist, to be real to feel that. If you listen to that thing, if you take that offer, there won't be a you around anymore to care."

The thought of death...I don't want to die, but it wasn't frightening to me. I've always viewed it as just another part of life. Not something I want to happen, not something pleasant, but inevitable and necessary all the same. But being unmade? Having everything about me erased? To never have existed? The thought of that terrified me, made me nauseous, and made it easy to resist the whispering voice.

"Has this happened before?"

It was my voice that broke the silence once the knocking and whispering had finally ceased. Adam's only response was a single shake of the head, his gaze remaining locked on the door. I tried to get something more out of him, anything more, but he remained quiet and still. He didn't seem afraid, though, more so that he was deep in thought, and slowly becoming resigned to whatever he was considering.

"When did you first notice things were changing?"

His question, out of the blue and completely ignoring my own threw me off guard as I blurted out the answer, "Just a few days ago, maybe two, maybe three?" I replied...and immediately wished I hadn't as I watched the dread slowly overtake his features.

"Too fast, they're never this fast." He muttered, I don't know if he intended me to hear that, I think he was more talking to himself, but there was no way I was going to ignore that.

"What do you mean too fast? Is this something you've seen before? Who the fuck even are you?" My questions were hissed out in rapid succession, I was frustrated, afraid, and needed answers like I needed to breathe, but I remembered to stay quiet. They couldn't get in, the previous...however long had proven that, but I didn't want to draw the thing attention back to us.

"Adam's not my name, you know?" Out of all the things I thought he might say, that wasn't one of them. Not even close. "I don't think it is, at least. I don't remember what it might have been. I took the name Adam because..." He hesitated here, a look of frustration and despair crossing his features, "I think it had something to do with whoever was here before me."

At that I glanced back to the people clumped around the room. Even those who were faded and faint were paying attention now as Adam spoke.

"These things, they've always been around. And someone has always had to be here. In this place. I don't know what it was before, I don't know what it'll be in the future. Right now it's an empty store with a breakroom that has shit coffee on tap, and me. I've been here...I can't remember. It feels too long, and it feels like it's not been nearly enough time, but I've been here. I remember the ones that have faded, I forget myself, and I keep them at bay. Mostly."

As Adam fell silent, the entire room stared at him, those that were faded, those clinging on, and me. I stared and tried to poke holes into his story, tried to find some way for it to be a ruse, a lie. But what sane person would go to the lengths I had experienced for a trick, a joke? Not to mention what I'd experienced. Pieces of myself just...vanishing, like they'd never been there. My cat....my cat. It hurt that I couldn't remember their name. I could remember the feel of the fur under my hands, the sensation of them purring as they laid on my chest at night. I could remember these little, wonderful things, but not their name.

"What..." I tried, and had to clear my throat with a ragged cough that held the notes of a sob, "What do you mean you remember the ones that faded? How does any of that keep...keep whatever that thing was, things like it, from doing whatever they want?" I asked Adam. There was no demand in my voice, just a wavering request hidden in the words, begging for answers, for a solution, for a way to just magically fix it all. He had none of that to give me, though.

"This place... it can’t hold together without an anchor. Without something that remembers, holding everything in place. I don't know how it does it, or why... I only know that it works, why I have to be here, because the person before me knew this and told me, and the person before them, and so on." He paused then, looking at me with something akin to pity in his eyes.

"It's for that reason I know, too, that if this happening so fast now, if they're getting so bold, my time is running out. You could say I'm...degrading, and it come time for someone else to stay here." As he spoke, in the background I could hear one of them speaking, just a name, repeated over and over again. I don't know who's it was. Maybe they didn't either. But in the quiet, the name was repeated.

"Someone else? Who, exactly?" I asked him, dreading the answer. Knowing what it would be, and praying I was wrong.

"You already know who. Everyone here, look at them...us. Even the one's fighting to stay real, they're too faded. But you? You have most of yourself, you've lost pieces but not nearly as much as the rest." He paused then, stepping closer to rest a hand on my shoulder. The weight somehow both solid, unyielding and at the same insignificant in a way that left me wanting to recoil from the touch.

"For what it's worth, I'm sorry."

At that I finally grew angry, angry that this was happening to me, angry at his assumption that I'd just take his spot in this fucking purgatory, "What the fuck do you mean you're sorry? I don't have to do this, I don't have to be here, I can leave! I can go..." All the built up anger, the steam I had vented dissipated in a rush, leaving me feeling unsteady without it holding me together as I realized there was no home for me to go to. There was no job waiting for me, there was no cat. Soon, if he was telling the truth - and it seemed like he was - there'd be nothing left for me...and eventually there'd be no me.

Adam just stood there as I yelled, looking as if he'd been expecting that exact reaction. As I went quiet, he just nodded, as if following along with my train of thought - though by the look on his face it was clear he wished he didn't.

"If you leave, what's happening to you will continue to happen. Bigger and bigger pieces of your life will vanish until..." He trailed off, but his words echoed my thoughts. Leaving meant being unmade, ultimately. But staying? It didn't feel like a better option.

"Will I end up like them, if I stay here?" I asked, my voice small and meek, like a scared child asking a doctor if the shot was going to hurt.

"No, not like them. You'll take my place, be the new anchor. You’ll lose your name, your edges - but some part of you will hold. Maybe not clearly. Maybe not knowingly. But it will hold." His words were meant to be a comfort, I think. If so, they were a old one, at best. When I didn't reply, he watched me, looking me over as though searching for something. Whatever he sought, he must have found. Adam gave a nod to the others in the room, the faded and not, and they all began to draw close, forming a tight circle around the pair of us.

"You don't have to do anything." He told me as he reached out to grab my hand, "Just listen, remember. That's all."

"What happens to me?" I asked as I clutched to his hand like a lifeline.

He gave my hand a squeeze, offering me a sad smile. “You stay. You remember. Until you can’t anymore. Until someone who needs to finds this place, and you pass on the burden. And you rest."

The way he said rest, I knew he meant a genuine rest. Not oblivion. Not an unmaking. It was strange how much that filled me with relief, the knowledge that while I might die, I wouldn't be unmade in the end. When my turn was up.

"Right. Right." Was my only reply, what else could I say that would sum up what I was feeling. Nothing could come close, everything I could think to say fell short. I gave a nod then, and that was when a woman came up, faded, flickering on the edges, and began to speak, “My name was Emily Muir. I liked the rain. I worked in a flower shop that smelled like wet dirt and crushed petals. I was engaged. His name was Lyle. He forgot me first.”

Her voice started faint, like an echo, but grew stronger as she spoke. Steadier, more grounded. As she finished the woman, Emily, reached up to press gentle fingers against my forehead. As her skin brushed against mine she flickered -gone for a heartbeat- and then returned, solid and sharp, like she’d finally been remembered, and was remembering in turn. As she did so I began to \*remember\* as well. I could remember the pride I felt watching my flowers grow. I could remember the brush of Lyle's lips against mine the first time we kissed. I could remember the way I cried, happy tears, when he proposed in the middle of the flower shop.

"Emily Muir," I croaked out without understanding why, but knowing it needed to be said, "You mattered."

As I spoke I felt a sensation like burning spreading through my insides, it hurt, god, it hurt like nothing I'd experienced before. But when Emily smiled at me, and gave me the faintest of nods before dissolving, I knew I'd done the right thing. As I heaved in a breath, tightening my grip on Adams hand, another stepped forward.

"My name was Jonathan Reed. I loved to go fishing with my uncle. I read my little sister stories when she went to bed. I died such a long time ago, and no one ever noticed."

On it went like that, each person sharing what was left of themselves, the small pieces they clung to. And each piece burned inside me like a brand, etching into me with a permanence it felt like nothing could erase. Slowly, the gathering of people dwindled, each one dissolving as they shared their memory, until only Adam remained.

"I lied, you know. I think my name might have been Michael...or maybe that was just someone I tried to save. If it was, safe to say I failed." He said with a bitter laugh, "I remember a brother though, I know that for certain. So much of me has faded, but I remember a brother. Day's spent chasing frogs...coffee that always burned my tongue." He clasped my shoulder then, squeezing tight and reassuring, "I've been here a long, long time I think. It'll be nice to finally rest...and remember, you've still got a name. You've still got so many pieces of yourself, and now you have mine as well."

He faded then, dissolving as the others had before him. I knew, without knowing how, that they hadn't been unmade as the thing had wanted. they'd passed on, in a very literal sense, to a knew place. Somewhere, I hoped, was restful.

Sinking down into a rickety, plastic seat at the break room table, I remained quiet for a long while. Processing the memories I now held, the pieces of other people that lived in me. Eventually, I drew out my phone, and I began to type.

That's where I am now, typing out this story for all to see and hear. Don't forget them. Don't forget me. My name is Daniel. I matter. I had a cat. She loved... I can’t remember. But I know she mattered, too. And someday, when the time comes, someone will come to this place afraid and confused, and I'll say to them what Adam said to me 'You got it's attention, didn't you?'.
