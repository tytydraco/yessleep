And God looked at the world, and thought it good.

Those words had always comforted me when I looked around the world I called home. To know that it was the creation of the lord my God. A creation so perfect and good that God himself looked upon it with pride, made me always feel his love when I remembered it was where I was. As I watched that creation grow smaller and smaller from the window of my sleeping section, I almost felt the space that had been left by the comfort ache. 

When the church decided that they needed to have a representative on the first interstellar flight to a possibly inhabited planet, I had honestly not once thought to volunteer myself, and was more than surprised when I was informed by his holiness that I; due to my scientific background, was the church's choice.

I won't mention my name, or the names of those who are my companions on this journey, as requested by the Vatican when they asked me to make reports, I am not to include any personal details of anyone who is aboard. I will included here again, that while I will follow this instruction, I object to its necessity. The names of those who are undertaking this brave endeavor should be inscribed in all the records of man, including the church's. 

The crew in mention consists of myself and seven other. In lieu of their names I will note them by their titles. 

On my first day onboard I was greeted by the first engineer. She; a catholic, seemed very reassured to have me with them.  

"Welcome Father, first time in space?" She had asked me.

While my position in the church has allowed to me attend many wonderful events, space tourism had not been one of them.

As I entered into the ship through the docking bay, I made note immediately of the difference in how heavy my body felt. The smaller ship that had shuttled my up from earth had featured significantly lighter artificial gravity, meaning I had experienced the disorienting, though fascinating sensation of weightlessness once we had gotten far enough away from the planet, but now I was on the much larger craft, the gravity was almost that of earth's.

The ship really is a thing of beauty. When I first saw it on my approach I wondered at its strange design. As noted in my initial briefing, FTLUA01 is the first of its kind, the ships outer coating of polynano solar captive foam, provided the vessel with more than enough power through the absorption of solar radiation. While also having the side effect of making the ship have the appearance of a golden cloud. During my initial conversation with the first engineer, she mentioned that this strange appearance had earned the ship a more, perhaps, sacrilegious nickname. The Golden Lamb.

I was brought directly to the captain, who at the time was at her main control station at the heart of the ship. She greeted me with a military demeanor, but I could sense that she wasn't too pleased at my presence. 

"Welcome aboard Father, I hope your shuttle ride was comfortable enough for you." 

I smiled and sighed "I am still trying to get myâ€¦space legs?" I said.

She gave a restrained laughed and then, spotting them, introduced me to her second in command. He was a lot more open in his disapproval of my presence.

"So tell me father, how many hail Mary's do you think it will take to save us from being atomized if this whole things go wrong?" He asked me. 

I feel my worry about this possibility was clearly shown on my face, as the captain spoke up. "We have run this mission through the simulators thousands of times, that's very unlikely." She said too the both of us. 

I tried to not show the change in my demeanor caused by my fear, I want them to know I have conviction in my faith that God will protect us.

The captain then showed me to my quarters, I tried to say I could find my own way if she was busy, but she insisted. 

I must say, while I am very grateful for the comfort that the church apparently has insisted that I am given while on bored, based on reactions from the rest of the crew I believe it may have caused me to be somewhat resented. 

Now I am settled, I will set myself to the studies I was tasked to by his holiness before I left. I hope that the areas of our faith that he feels will allow me to better minister to the crew will aid me. Though I am still confused how brushing up on my ancient Hebrew will achieve this.

I will send my next update in four days as requested. 

\*Notes from handler

We can confirm that the father had made it onboard and is able to send us communications.

From the father's notes, it seems that our insistence that his quarters have a level of luxury above what is available to the rest of the crew, has created some hostility between him and them. This will hopefully form an emotional border keeping them from bonding too much with them. 

No mentioned on him finding and questioning the Mandata desuper, but we can confirm that it was placed in his belongings before he left. He should find it soon.
