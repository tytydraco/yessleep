It was just before Halloween and I wanted to do something fun.

I always loved spooky season, and my appreciation had only grown as I did. 

That’s why it wasn’t a hard sell when I saw the flyer.

“The World’s Longest Corn Maze.”

“Come and get lost in the longest corn maze in the world. Thrills! Chills! Scares for all ages! A terrifying trip awaits!” 

It was corny (haha). But, it sounded cute. I decided to make the trip, it wasn’t very far anyhow. A bit of a drive, obviously, I don’t live in the middle of endless cornfields, but not a vacation trip or anything.

So, I headed out, leaving the borders of my city behind and watching the view from my car window slowly turn to sprawling farm fields. It was a relaxing setup for a fun afternoon. 

“Wow! This really could be the world’s largest.” I whistled to myself. 

At a point, the farms had turned to just a single, sprawling field of corn. I picked up the pace, realizing that it wasn’t surprising the field had felt so huge when I was running a few minutes later than my GPS had predicted. 

Finally, a small dirt road split the field, decorated with a white banner declaring “The World’s Largest Corn Maze”. Only now it said “The World’s Largest Haunted Corn Maze”, with the world haunted crudely scrawled on in bloody red paint. It looked like they had stylishly modified the usual sign for Halloween, not that I had assumed this place to be open any time but Halloween. 

I slowly trundled my car up the path to the impromptu parking area of flattened corn husks. A few other cars were already there. The flat area was roughly a circle, at the back of which was a narrow opening flanked by stanchions, the entrance to the actual maze I assumed. 

A small crowd was standing in front of that opening. I headed towards it. 

“Oh! Good. Another one. I think that rounds out your group.” A young lady stood behind the shuffling crowd, she was in jeans, a grey T-shirt, and had a lanyard dangling from her neck making it obvious she was the ticket taker. She smiled up at me after addressing the crowd. “You want to brave the maze?” 

“Absolutely!” I chuckled. “Let’s get me some thrills and chills.” 

“That I can promise!” She laughed back. “It’s just five dollars for admission.” 

“Five bucks?” I was shocked. Halloween experiences, even simpler ones, hardly ever cost less than twenty these days, even a little strip mall haunted house is fifteen at the lowest. “Alright then, maybe I should go twice!” I joked as I handed over the money.

“Trust me, that won’t be necessary.” She took the bill and stepped back to address the whole crowd. “Okay, everyone! As I’m sure you already know, this is the world’s largest corn maze.” 

“Damn right!”

“Yeah!” 

The crowd playfully agreed, mostly young guys trying to build enthusiasm. 

“It’s also notoriously haunted. There will be scares, please do not touch the spirits. That is the first rule. Do not ever, ever, walk into the corn. That is the second rule. Finally, no matter what route you take, you will reach three rest areas. You may do as you please in them.” 

“Wow, rest areas?” Another guy in the crowd, a young tanned man, asked. “How long is this?” 

“I can’t give everything away. But, I think most of the flyers indicated that this isn’t a short maze. Let’s just say, if you have anything scheduled, you will want to go now.”

“Wow.” One of the young women in the crowd muttered. Several people started whispering to each other, working out if this fit with their day’s plans. Surprisingly, everyone stayed. 

“Okay. You will all enter ahead. Just navigate the maze and have fun! I do recommend staying in groups, that’s why I held some of you until we got enough people. One last warning: things will get scarier after each rest area. You can split up to check out the different routes, but do take care not to stray far, especially after the first rest or two.”

“If it’s this big, what do we do if we really get lost? Is there a way to signal? How can we get out if we really have to?” Another man asked. This one was much older than the high school to college demographic of most of the people there. 

“Oh don’t worry, like I said; scares are everywhere. You are never alone in the maze. And if you need somewhere to go, just head to the farmhouse.”

“There’s a farmhouse?” A young woman from the crowd asked. 

“It’ll take a while, but you’ll see it.” She smiled. “Now come on! I think that covers everything! Let’s go! Enjoy the maze, everyone! And for the last time, follow the same rules as any haunted house: don’t touch the spirits, don’t touch the props, and don’t leave the path!” 

All of us went single file through the path into the maze. The first path only went ten feet before splitting left and right. 

“Well? First choice.” The same college guy who asked about the rest areas spoke first. 

“Does either way dead end?” I spoke up next. 

We wordlessly agreed and both jogged down a bit. My end, left, branched again after a right turn some ten feet down. 

“Keeps going over here.” I reported back. 

“Same.” He called while returning. 

“The choice is obvious then.” The older man joined next. “We split up.”

“Already?” I questioned. “Weren’t we just told to stick together?” I pointed back to the still-visible admissions woman.

“Yes, but this group is way too big to agree on every turn. It’s the perfect time to break into manageable teams. Anyway, it’s pretty much certain we’ll just have to backtrack and reconnect soon enough. We all know these mazes can only be so complex.” 

“Alright.” We all agreed. 

The groups mostly silently split as people headed over to either me for the left route or the tanned guy to go right until four people settled in each group. 

“Good luck over there.” Their informal leader wished us.

“Same to you.” I called back.

“Should we introduce ourselves? Might make things more fun.” The woman who asked about the farmhouse spoke up. “I’m Aubrey.” 

“Sure.” I gave my name.

“Brad.” The third member of our group was one of the college guys in a sports jersey. 

“Darius.” Another young guy, maybe High School, maybe college-aged. Either way, he was less sporty and more casual than Brad, wearing plain jeans and a tee. 

And so we headed further in. We scouted the next left-right fork to find the left quickly dead-ended, so went right. The next choice wasn’t obvious, so we went left again, and so on. 

As for what we saw in the maze? Corn. It was just towering walls of corn for the longest time. 

“Some haunted maze, eh?” Brad seemed painfully bored. 

I couldn’t say it was particularly exciting either, but at least the maze was soothing to move through. 

“They did was it would get spookier after the rest areas, whatever those are.” I reminded him. 

“We must be going in circles to miss those then, ‘cause it’s been,” he checked his phone and his eyes widened in shock “holy shit! Twenty minutes!” 

“‘Largest in the world’.” I laughed. “Can’t say she didn’t warn us. We’ll get some-wow!” 

My reassurance was interrupted by a scarecrow that in the fleeting glance of it I got looked to be holding a sickle dart across the path, disappearing into the corn almost as swiftly as it appeared. 

“There’s something.” I said after the spook.

“Whoo. One scarecrow. This better get better fast.” He grumbled. 

We continued through the maze. After another shockingly long time navigating the corn a flock of crows loudly shot across the path. 

“Ah!” This time Aubrey screamed. 

“Holy shit!” Darius cursed.

“Was that a coincidence?” I wondered after calming myself down. 

“Who knows? I mean, some tame birds can’t be that hard?” Brad shrugged. “Besides, they’re crows and we’re in corn.”

It was true enough. It didn’t much matter either way. We kept going. It became like a form of meditation, drifting mindlessly through the corn, unconsciously choosing turns. Even in that state though, it began to feel so endless and eternal that the softly rustling rows slowly became almost as oppressive as soothing. That feeling wasn’t helped by spotting scarecrow-like faces in the corn from the corner of my eye and eerie rustling noises following us, sometimes for minutes only to disappear without anything happening. It was a real shock when the narrow path opened up into a clearing. 

We found ourselves in a roughly six-foot circle. Sitting on the left end of it was a small table. On that table were bottles of water, granola bars, and a sign with the words “Rest Area”. 

“Well, here we are.” I tried to sound unbothered, but even I had to admit this was exhausting. 

“Hell yeah.” Brad’s cheer was dripping with sarcasm. “After only…” he checked his phone “Jesus, nearly two hours!” 

“Hey, we were told it might take all day.” I shrugged, trying to look on the bright side. “I can’t say I don’t have any regrets, but let’s try not to make things too sour. We are stuck here after all.” 

I grabbed a bottle and chugged the water while pocketing my granola bar. 

“Are we?” Darius questioned. “Hey! Spook staff! We’re bored as hell here! Can we get a ride back? Like, now?” He yelled into the corn.

Everyone waited to see what, if anything, would happen. 

Nothing did. 

“Come on guys.” Aubrey spoke while grabbing her water and snack. “In for a penny, in for a pound. Let’s do this.” 

“Yeah.” I agreed. “Worst case, it doesn’t get any shorter. But, it still won’t be as boring. We were promised better scares with each stop.” 

Clearly, neither young guy wanted to look too chicken, both grudgingly took their water and bar without more complaint. 

We headed back into the maze. 

It didn’t take long for things to start going differently. After just a few minutes of walking, we all heard something strange and turned around. 

Following us was another scarecrow, quietly walking in synch with our own movements. After just a second of staring at each other, it raised its sickle-clutching hand and waved it slowly back and forth while stepping sideways into the corn. 

“Okay, that was a little spooky.” Aubrey said. 

“Yeah, not gonna lie, he got me for a moment there.” Brad agreed. “Maybe this won’t all be a bust. They just better not drag this shit out for another two hours.” 

We continued, looking over our shoulders and listening more carefully for scares. Our efforts were rewarded only a few turns later. 

Crows burst out from the corn around us. Hundreds of black birds shrieked and squawked in a feathered hurricane. All four of us panicked and rushed down the path, no longer picking routes but just rushing headlong to get away from the equally panicked flock. Eventually, the last of the birds disappeared into the corn. 

“Jesus! That can’t be safe or legal!” 

“No shit.” Darius agreed. 

“I almost had a heart attack!” Aubrey gasped. 

“Come on guys! That was just effed up!” Brad shouted into the corn. “Just take us outta here and we won’t sue your asses!” 

Predictably, there was no response. 

“Nothing? Fine, fuck you.” 

“Come on.” I was still catching my breath from the run. “Let’s just keep going we’ll flag down the next performer and say we’ve chickened out. Would they even know if someone was dying here? Shouldn’t they have cameras or something?” 

I caught myself marveling at how amateurish and unsafe something this huge managed to be. 

Everyone agreed and we continued our long march. We walked for what had to be ten minutes for the path to turn left without branching. Then another ten minutes and another left. And again. Eventually, Darius stopped us.

“This ain’t right.” He said.

“It’s been looping.” I agreed. 

“It has to be getting bigger or smaller.” Brad argued. “Or we would have seen the way we came in.” 

“If it were getting bigger, we would have crossed over it on the first loop back anyway. If it were getting smaller, we would be reaching the turns a hell of a lot quicker by now.” I pointed out. 

“Then what is it? Crappy as this place is, I don’t believe it’s really a haunted corn field.” He insisted. 

“They must have covered up the entrance and the exit. It must be a puzzle or a game.” Aubrey theorized.

“Let’s look then.” I agreed. 

“Nah. Even better, let’s hoist someone up. It’s time we got an idea where we are.” Darius countered with his own idea.

“I’m in.” Brad agreed. Ma and Aubrey both nodded. 

“Come on.” Darius addressed Brad. “Let’s get this guy up.”

I didn’t argue. I was obviously lighter and less strong than either of them, but taller than Aubrey, so I would get the best view for the least effort. I worked with both of them to get myself lifted as high up as possible. 

“What do you see?”

“Corn.”

Despite the situation, they choked back laughter. 

“No shit Sherlock. Where are we? Do you see a road? Any buildings?” Brad asked.

“No. I literally just see corn. Like, there are no other paths, no maze, just corn.” 

“What the hell?” Darius muttered. “No. You have to see the maze. I’ve seen pics of this kind of thing. The corn is only a few feet thick between lanes.” 

“There is no maze here. Just endless corn.” I insisted. 

It was true. To my horror, from where I was standing, all I could see was endless, unbroken corn with only our path extending in a straight line in either direction as far as I could see.

They brought me down. Darius immediately rushed for the corn and started tearing chunks down. 

“Be careful man.” I warned.

“They told us-“ Aubrey started.

“I don’t care what they said!” Darius shouted. “They led us into what?! An empty cornfield in the middle of nothing? What kind of sick joke is this?!” 

“I don’t know.” I admitted. “But I know that running blindly into the corn with the sickle-wielding scarecrows isn’t the answer.” 

He stopped grabbing at the corn and sat down in defeat.

“Fine.” He grudgingly admitted defeat. “What do we do then?” 

“No matter what I saw, if we stumbled into this loop, there is a way out. We search the path and we find it.” 

“It’s all we can do, isn’t it?” Aubrey agreed in resignation.

“Then what do we do?” Brad questioned. 

“I assume we’ve all already seen there is zero reception out here?” I pulled out my phone. 

Everyone nodded. 

“I had five bars back at the rest spot.” 

Their brows raised in shock. 

“Okay then, sounds like we have a plan.” Brad agreed.

We returned to slowly shuffling down the path. All of us scoured the edges for concealed paths in. After an impossibly long and boring shuffle, we saw something, but it wasn’t an opening in the corn.

Another scarecrow was standing on the path. 

This was the first time it stood in place long enough for me to get a real good look at it. Not that there was much to see. It was a pretty typical haunted house scarecrow costume: Dirty, ragged canvas shirt, trousers, and mask with straw sticking out of the seams. Stitches ran across the mask in a mouth shape, and two big Xs stood for eyes. 

“Hey! You!” Brad immediately started marching towards it, squaring his shoulders and looking ready for a fight. “I don’t know what you’re pulling, but just let us the fuck out of here.”

The scarecrow sharply raised its hand. Brad actually stopped in place, probably more on instinct than anything else. The scarecrow then grabbed an ear of corn from a plant beside it and rolled it across the ground down the lane in front of it. 

*Clang*

A loud metallic snap sounded. All of us screamed or jolted as a bear trap snapped shut. The figure then darted into the corn. 

“Was that a threat?” Brad seethed. His best opportunity to confront the actors had just been denied. 

“And a warning.” Aubrey speculated. 

“Okay, now we need to watch the ground for traps too.” I sighed. 

“Let’s just get moving.” Brad grumbled.

And so we did. The loop ended there. Inexplicably, the path just forked left and right ahead of us. We agreed on a route and took it.

Now keeping an eye out at all times, the maze moved slower than ever. It seemed like an impossibly long time had passed, though now interrupted by numerous, almost oddly mundane jump scares. 

“You know what time it is?” Darius asked. 

I checked my phone, although I knew he had one too.

“9:15 PM.” I answered. 

“That’s impossible.” He pointed out.

I looked up. 

“Yeah, it is.” I agreed. 

“What now?” Brad sighed. 

“Look.” I pointed at the sky. “It’s October. The sun is barely starting to set even though it’s after nine o’clock in late October? That’s impossible.” 

“What the hell is happening? Why?” Aubrey breathed out in hopeless panic. 

The part that confused me the most was that time had not totally frozen. When I entered the sun was nearly overhead. Now, it was late afternoon, casting a golden glow over the fields and long shadows across the ground. The perfect time for a corn maze certainly, just not the time we entered, nor the time it should be.

We continued to trek through the oppressively endless rows. 

“Shit!” Darius wrenched at something that ambushed him from the corn.

A moment later, after we all leapt back in shock, we saw him throw aside the “ambusher”: a scarecrow mask stuck on a cornstalk. Darius grumbled at the cheap scare and marched on.

We all jumped at the snap. All of us except Darius, he collapsed screaming. 

Brad was the first to rush forward and help. A bear trap had clamped shut on Darius' foot. He had been too distracted by the prop scare to notice it. 

“Christ! What the hell!” Darius screamed.

“It’s not as bad as it looks.” Brad reassured as he worked to loosen the trap. “There’s no teeth, and it didn’t snap nearly as tight as a real bear trap.” 

“They’re still trying to kill us.” Aubrey lamented. 

“Which is why we need to get to the rest area.” I chimed in, trying to keep us focused on the one idea we had as possible. 

“Yeah,” Brad agreed “Come on man, let’s get moving.” He helped Darius to stand and walk again.

“What if they just kill us?” The injury had clearly shaken him. 

“Then they try to kill us. The only helpful thing for us to focus on is getting out of here.” I continued to try to keep things calm and focused. 

It was hard of course, this situation was insane. I didn’t fancy the thought of dying in there though. 

The trek was hellish. Our exhausted bodies walked for hours upon hours under a constant barrage of sounds and sightings of creeping scarecrows and flapping crows. Our clocks said we trekked through the night and well into the next morning. The sky never changed. 

Eventually, we stumbled into it. Our tired brains failing to reconcile for a few moments what had happened. We were in the next rest area. It was the same size as the first. Everything about it was identical at first sight. 

Aubrey almost dropped her phone in the scrabble to call out. All of us followed almost as quickly. 

“It’s not letting me call out.” Brad murmured in a panic.

“Same here. Nothing’s connecting.” Darius aggressively paced around the circle pounding in numbers.

“Why would they give us reception on purpose if they won’t let us call anything?” Aubrey questioned.

I was rushing around the clearing just as manically as the others, checking if any spot was free of this mysterious block when I saw it. 

I laughed. I couldn’t help but find it a perfectly dumb joke. 

“Guys.” They were staring at me like I’d grown a second head. They must have thought I’d broken from the stress. Maybe I had. I picked up the card lying beside the water bottles and granola bars and showed it to them. 

It had a QR code for us to scan with our phones and some text beneath.

“Please leave us a 5-star review!”

We were in Hell. 

And we weren’t leaving any time soon.
