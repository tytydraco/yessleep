Beanbag adventure is a Chinese TikToker who posts videos about exploring abandoned places on his account, but the place he is going to this time turned his life upside down. The place he discovered caused a huge sensation on social media in China and beyond.

The story begins several months ago, when a Chinese man was posting videos on TikTok featuring the exploration of abandoned places. However this wasn't the reason for his fame, as he had very few followers on his account and received very few views. But one day, he stumbled upon a giant building resembling a secret lab in the forest. The building was abandoned and emitted a foul odor. He decided to enter and explore its interior.

As he entered the place, the stench became even stronger, so overpowering that he had trouble breathing and began to vomit, forcing him to exit in search of fresh air. After a while, he returned wearing a mask to withstand the smell. However, even with the mask, he could still faintly smell it.

Inside the lab, he noticed it was vast, with many corridors, each containing numerous rooms. Whoever built this place had invested a significant amount of money. Not knowing which way to go, he decided to follow the smell to discover its source. He wanted to find out what was causing the repugnant odor, and that's exactly what he did. He roamed the place searching for the source of the smell until he reached a room with a large basin.
 The smell was overwhelming in this room, and when he approached the sink, he saw that it was filled with green liquid with small dolls floating on it.  The thing that horrified him was after he realized that these were not dolls but human bodies.  After seeing this horrific sight, he quickly left the place.

After he posted the video on TikTok, people had divided opinions. The first opinion claimed that these were just dolls resembling children, and he was only seeking followers. But many of those holding this opinion would change their minds after ten months.

If this was fake, why didn't he post the second part? The first video garnered a large number of views, but after posting it, he returned to his normal life and never spoke about the factory again. People kept asking him in the comments about it and requested a sequel, but he ignored them as if they didn't exist. However, the scene was truly terrifying, nearly impossible to fake to that extent, leading us to the second opinion, which asserts that they were indeed human children.

He remained silent for ten months until he returned and posted a new video reentering the place.


On his second visit, he found something different. Above the basin, he discovered a white plastic cover that wasn't there the first time. Additionally, there was a large quantity of empty chemical bottles and a lot of children's clothing. Considering this change, we can conclude that someone comes to this place, and naturally, what they are doing is illegal. It seems that they might be kidnapping children and bringing them to this location. 

However, there's something else I haven't told you. It answers the question of why this unknown person brings children here. When the man examined the bodies closely, he found that they were real flesh, meaning they were truly human. The second thing is that they were hollow inside. This suggests that the kidnapper might bring the children here, kill them, remove their internal organs, and then either sell them or perhaps eat them before disposing of their bodies in the acid-filled basin until they decompose.

The Chinese man returned to his home to come back the next day and explore the upper floor, and here, the shock was even greater. What he found on the first floor was just the beginning. On the second floor, he found a large quantity of empty bottles, children's clothing, and masks. But the most horrifying discovery was small children's bones.

So, the purpose of the basin in the lower floor is to dissolve the flesh, and when only the bones remain, it's easier to dispose of them. It is easier to hide a bone than to hide an entire body.
 The number of people who were saying this was fake began to decrease dramatically after this video, So the Chinese Tik Tok closed his account, but this was not enough for people to forget what they saw, as this caused terror in their hearts.

After a few days, the Chinese TikToker reopened his account, but what's strange is that the four videos he posted about the lab were nowhere to be found. This means that the things he found in the lab were real. The question that perplexed many is why TikTok deleted the account, then reinstated it, and deleted the videos. If the reason was that they contained Sensitive scenes, why didn't they delete the first video immediately after it was posted? Why didn't he speak about it again and inform his followers about the situation? Because this matter has occupied the entire Chinese society. 
Some amateur investigators tried to locate the factory based on images of the building, and they found a place that somewhat resembles a body factory.
I make a video about this 

Personally, I believe that the things found in the lab are real, what about you?
