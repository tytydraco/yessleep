I sat in my car, waiting for Pitty to text me his address. It was an odd feeling, I'll admit - to possess such a deep sense of urgency, yet also so much helplessness. I so desperately wanted to save my friend. But I didn't know *where* I needed to go.

After what felt like forever, my phone finally buzzed. It was a text from Pitty. No words. Just a GPS pin drop.

I turned on the car and slammed on the gas.

\*\*\*

As I pulled into Pitty's driveway, I wondered how he could afford to live in an actual *house* off his minimum wage job. Then again, I figured he could've inherited the place from a dead grandma or something.

But none of that was of immediate importance.

I sprinted up the front steps and pounded on the door. "Pitty! Open up!"

There was no answer.

I peered through his window.

All the lights were off and it seemed like no one was home.

I tried the doorknob, which was locked, then ran around the side of the house where I found a bathroom window, slightly cracked open. It was a tight fit, but I was finally able to squeeze my way through.

The moment I fell through and tumbled onto the tile floor is when it hit me...

I was now alone in a stranger's house.

And there was no telling what awaited me in the next room.

\*\*\*

"Pitty? Are you here? Hello?"

I was flipping light switches on, one by one, as I made my way through the unfamiliar space. Pitty's house was pretty plain, with not much on the walls in terms of decorations or anything. I almost started to wonder if I was in the wrong place entirely.

Then I checked the GPS ping again, which confirmed that I was not only in the right spot, but that I was almost *directly* on top of Pitty's phone.

In other words, I was fucking close.

I carefully inspected the bedroom, kitchen, guest bathroom, and living room (all empty), until I finally settled on one final door in the hallway that I hadn't opened yet. It was a closet.

I checked my phone again. The small blue dot told me that Pitty's phone (and hopefully the man himself) were in there.

I knocked on the door.

"Pitty? Are you in there? It's me. I'm... gonna open the door."

I slowly turned the knob and opened the door, bracing myself for something terrible.

And that's when I saw him.

Pitty was curled up in the corner of the closet.

A frozen smile permanently etched on his face.

His skin was pale and I could see the blue veins through the bulge of his neck.

"Pitty!"

I grabbed him and pulled him out of that dark, cramped space.

He was alive. Awake. But... not quite right.

"His face... his face..." he kept mumbling. 

I called 911 and stayed by his side until help showed up.

\*\*\*

I sat around all night in the waiting room of the hospital for the doctors to give me an update on my coworker's condition. At one point, I asked if they'd been in touch with any of his family members.

"Doesn't seem like he has any," one of the nurses said. "Not immediate ones, at least."

Somehow, that made me feel even more bad for the guy.

Since I wasn't family myself, I was told I couldn't visit Pitty until he was in more stable condition. But I couldn't go home. Not until I knew he was alright.

So I remained there in the waiting room, hour after hour, nodding off here and there.

At one point, I woke up to the flickering and flashing of the overhead lights in the room. At first, I thought nothing of it. I assumed maybe that was normal since the building was using a heap of electricity (ventilators? I don't know) but once they flickered again and stayed *off* for a bit too long was when I got worried.

I sat up in my seat and looked around. A clock told me it was now almost 4AM. I was literally now the only person in the waiting room. I looked over to the front desk, figuring it was time I should ask for another update, but it seemed the receptionist had temporarily stepped away from her station.

That's around the time when the tiny TV set in the waiting room was overcome with loud static, like the connection had gone bad. Then, the screen went blue, as if someone had inserted a VHS tape (though there was no VCR built into the device).

What I saw next convinced me that I was still dreaming.

It was another Happy Burger commercial from decades past, though this one was... different. Happy and his friends paraded down the hallway of a hospital that looked eerily similar to the one I was currently inside of - and they were discussing how their food has the power to make sick kids "happy" again.

Then, suddenly and without warning, the footage cut to Pitty's room, where I saw my friend, barely conscious and surrounded by Happy, Scowler, and the Tree Taker.

"There's nothing quite like Happy Burger to make you feel better, ain't that right, kiddo?" Happy asked.

Pitty simply shrugged uncomfortably, as if he was just as confused as to how and why he was suddenly inside of a commercial.

My heart dropped and I could suddenly feel a thumping in my neck.

"No..." was all I could say to myself as I watched the TV, still in disbelief. "Pitty!"

I couldn't take it anymore. I got up and burst through the nearest doors and sprinted down the hallway. I heard some nurse yell "Sir? Excuse me!" but I didn't even care. I had to make sure he was okay.

I ran all the way down the corridor and around the corner and eventually found my way into room 309 which is where they'd told me Pitty was being treated.

I was terrified of going inside that room, but I knew I had to face my fears.

I rounded the corner, but much to my shock... Happy, Scowler, and the Tree Taker were no longer in there.

*Had I dreamed that commercial?* No, it was so real...

Pitty, however, was awake. He looked up at me with a blank look on his face. I knew he wouldn't be 100% recovered, but... something was still wrong with him. He just... didn't seem like himself.

"Are you okay, man?"

He just stared at me.

"Pitty?" I asked again. "Can you hear me? Just tell me you're okay. I need to know you're okay. They won't tell me anything."

"Yeah," he finally said, so quietly that I could barely hear him. "I think everything's gonna be fine now..."

"You do?"

He nodded. "Totally. I feel... *happy."*

If *that* was happy, then I never wanted to experience joy again.

He didn't say much else after that. Eventually, one of the nurses found me in the room and told me I had to leave.

So I did.

\*\*\*

I was in bed by 5, which meant the sun was coming up before I could even close my eyes. I tried to sleep (I was so backed up it wasn't even funny) but of course, I couldn't.

After a couple of hours of rolling around and shifting uncomfortably in my sheets, I figured that there was one more person I needed to pay a visit to in order to get the answers I so desperately wanted.

Sometime around 10, when I knew Happy Burger would just be opening up for breakfast, I got in my car and drove down to the restaurant. I marched inside and headed straight into Rick's office, only to find my boss sitting at his desk, as if he'd been waiting for this very moment.

"Pittyâ€“" I started.

"I know," Rick said. "Close the door. It's time for us to talk."

\*\*\*

Rick told me everything.

And I listened carefully to every word.

"Back when I first bought the restaurant, I enlisted in the help of a small production company. They said they could help me make a commercial for cheap. We tried to come at it from a few different angles, but it just wasn't working. It felt forced and awkward. That's when one of their directors suggested we come up with a mascot."

"Happy," I said.

Rick nodded as he went on. "It was supposed to *cute.* That's what he said. Just some funny little clown to help us sell the idea that we were a fun place to eat at. So a week later, we show up and the guy's got all these *other* outfits that he claimed were designed by some costume designer friend of his. There was Happy, of course, who wanted to make kids happy by giving them burgers. Then some giant blob named Scowler, who wanted to steal away those burgers. And even some tree, who would take the kids away if they didn't finish their food."

I pictured those three in my head as I remembered what I saw on the tape.

Their awful faces.

"Then what happened?" I asked.

"We ran the ad. And at first, it worked. More people were coming in than ever before. But that's when we started getting the reports."

"What reports?"

Rick swallowed before he went on, as if his throat was suddenly dry as a desert.

"Children were getting freaked out. Which wasn't surprising. Even I thought the costumes were kinda creepy. But... that wasn't all. The kids were claiming Happy and Scowler and the Tree Taker were visiting them in their dreams. Apparently, these dreams were so real they were refusing to go to sleep. One parent found their six-year-old screaming "The Tree Taker! The Tree Taker!" and he was completely tangled up in his bedsheets. He almost suffocated."

"Jesus...." I whispered.

"So we cut the ad. And that was that. Or so I thought..." Rick shook his head. "Then a few years back, one of my night shift workers starts saying he saw a clown roaming the kitchen after hours. A clown named *Happy*. I figure it's someone who somehow got an old copy of the discontinued commercial, playing a prank on us. Few days later, my employee calls me and starts crying. Says Happy won't let him stop eating. *I can't finish my burger*, he said. *Now they're gonna take me*. I figure the guy's drunk or something. The next morning, I hear that... that he was found dead in his house. They said he accidentally choked to death while eating, but... I just knew, deep down, something was wrong."

"So you replaced him," I said.

"I had to," Rick claimed. "I was running a business."

"And when it happened again?"

"I just... kept repeating the cycle."

"Until me," I said softly.

"Until you."

I took this all in. I mean, there were *some* answers, but I also had more questions than ever. Questions that neither I nor Rick would ever know the answers to - and that alone was enough to drive me crazy.

"I'd go to the cops, but no one will believe me," I told Rick. "But this is all your fault. You *let* this happen. You almost killed Pitty. You're a fucking monster."

"I didn't know what else to do!" Rick whimpered.

I stared at my boss for a long moment before finally saying, "I quit."

Then I walked out of the restaurant and never went back.

\*\*\*

A few weeks later, I drove by Happy Burger and was absolutely shocked to find that Rick had shut the place down for good. I sat at the stop sign for a while, utterly grateful that no one else would ever have to go through what I went through.

Eventually, a car honked at me and I kept on driving.

It wasn't long after that I got a call from the hospital, saying Pitty had finally been cleared to go home. They warned me that he'd suffered some type of brain damage and that my friend would never be the same again, but also said that visiting him would probably make him happy, considering he had no family.

I, of course, told them I'd visit, but I'm being honest, I still haven't mustered up the courage to go over there.

Oh yeah, and if you're wondering what happened to my whole financial situation, I am in fact working a new job these days and am able to pay the bills.

It's actually a telemarketing gig (don't laugh), which is definitely lame and boring for the most part, but on the plus side, I get to sit in a brightly lit room with dozens of other people like me, and there's no night shifts or burgers or Ricks in sight.

Things have been pretty normal so far, other than a prank call I got the other day.

It sounded like a man on the other line, though I couldn't hear him very well because the connection was shit. 

"Are you happy?" is what I'm pretty sure he said.

"Yes?" I responded, almost like it was a question.

"How happy?" the prankster said through crackling static.

I hung up, not wanting to waste any more of my time and thought nothing of it.

During lunch that day, I was eating with Marlon, one of my new work friends in the breakroom. He'd had Happy Burger delivered to him via a food delivery service.

He shot me a weird look as I stared at the bag, watching him eat.

"What is it?" he asked, mouth full. "You want some fries? They're cold and soggy."

"No thanks," I said. 

"Then what is it?"

"Nothing," I finally responded.

I pushed my bag lunch aside.

Suddenly, I'd lose my appetite.

That's the moment I decided that after work, I'd finally go visit Pitty.
