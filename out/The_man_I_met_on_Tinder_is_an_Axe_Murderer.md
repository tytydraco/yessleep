As soon as I saw him, I swiped right without hesitation. He was young, and everything about him looked perfect. We were both in our early 30s, and when I discovered that we were a match, I was ecstatic. 

Me and Chris started talking over the phone, and he lived in the next state over. We both planned on meeting each other in person.

When I saw Chris in person that day, I knew this was the man I was going to love forever. Being with him made me feel like I was apart of something bigger then myself. 

I loved everything about him, his smile, his physique, his eyes, and most of all, his personality. 

I moved in with him that same exact day, and we made love on our first night together. 

1 year later, I noticed changes in my health. I took a pregnancy test and I tested positive. I didn’t know how Chris would react, but he seemed really excited about having a child. 

My parents scolded me for getting pregnant before me and Chris’s marriage , but we ended up having a gender reveal party, and found out we were having a baby boy. 

It’s been about 3 and a half years since we met on tinder, and our son, Tyler, is now a year and a half old. 

Chris proposed to me 6 months ago, and our wedding day is in 2 weeks. I just wish I never found out about his secret hobby. 

For the last 2 years, people in our town have been mysteriously disappearing, with the majority being women. 

He left almost zero trace of what he was doing. He was so good at hiding it. 

The one thing I found suspicious, was every night, after we’d put our son to bed, he would always give me a glass of water before bed. 

My entire life I’ve had sleeping issues, some nights I wouldn’t even sleep at all, but ever since I moved in with Chris, I’ve been sleeping perfectly, sometimes even 13 to 14 hours of sleep a night. 

It was when I became suspicious when I walked in on Chris sharpening that giant axe.

I never really bothered Chris while he was working in the basement on his tools. I went down stairs and saw the axe. The handle had to be atleast 5 feet long, and he was sharpening the shit out of that blade. 

He works as an electrician, and as far as I know they don’t carry an axe that huge with them. He didn’t hear or see me, so I rushed back upstairs. 

After we put our son to bed that night, when he offered me the water, I held it in my mouth, then ran to the sink to spit it out. I noticed that I wasn’t able to fall asleep whatsoever. I laid there pretending to sleep, and after about 2 hours, my husband got out of bed. I saw the hall light turn on, and the basement door creaked open. 

It was extremely hard to see what was happening, but I did see that axe blade. 

I then heard the back door open. I rushed to look out the bathroom window, and I could see him going down to that old storm cellar in the corner of the yard. 

I never asked about the storm cellar, he said it’s been there since he bought the house. 

He then unlocked the door, and walked down its stairs. He slammed the door behind him. 

I then ran out the back door, and put my ear up to the storm cellar. I could hear a voice, a women’s voice. The voice was weeping, and begging. 

“I sharpened my axe for you” I heard Chris yell in a sinister voice. The women then screamed, at the top of her lungs, and Chris started laughing. 

I unlatched the door and sprinted down those stairs. In front of me was a room which had walls stained red. Chris had his back toward me and had that axe in his hands, dripping with blood. The women in-front of him had a river of blood pouring out of what was left of her mangled arm. 

“Chris” I said in a horrified voice.

Chris then turned to me, with blood in his smile.

“I think it’s about time you found out” he said. 

I started vomiting, I couldn’t even see straight. How could someone be so evil, I thought. I started screaming curse words in his direction. He then grabbed me by my shoulders.

“Don’t be like that” he said while trying to calm me down. He then handed me the axe.

“Why don’t you help me finish her off” he said, gesturing toward the dying woman. She looked to be about my age. She looked at me with desperation in her eyes. 

“Finish her, aim for the head” Chris told me.  

She started sobbing, to the point where I could barely hear Chris. 

“FINISH HER” Chris screamed.

That night was the worst night of my life, but I believe that I did the right thing. I did what I did for Chris, and I love him. Now I’ve got a wedding to prepare for.
