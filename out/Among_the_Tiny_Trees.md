The Sunlight is almost unbearably bright reflecting off the snow, but my eyes have grown to tolerate it. Still, everything is blurry and the wind kicking up the frost into my face doesn’t help, but I don’t care. We’re far enough down the mountain that there are now some very small trees able to grow, about the same height as me. The snow is deep, and it’s been frustrating to trudge through, but right now it doesn’t bother me. I strain my eyes to see off over the next ledge, it’s quite a ways ahead but, I can see far into the wilderness beneath.  

We’ve been running and falling over, laughing, and screaming for an immeasurable amount of time, probably somewhere between an instant and infinity. I’m not too certain about anything, but I feel at peace with everything. Delirious probably. But I don’t care.  In this moment we don’t need anything.  

The sun is beginning to set. The orange light makes every drop of moisture sparkle on the trees, on our clothes, on our eyebrows. I feel like I can see every piece of snow as an individual tiny flake, every drop of moisture that drips melted from the sun's heat. And we march on, Godlike giants among the tiny trees.  

Daniel has spotted a fox, and he is trying to coax it over to him with something. This is the first animal we have seen. I should be excited and hopeful, finding an animal, clear skies, these are things we’ve gone without for so long. But the euphoria I was feeling has faded into worry. My mind back where it should be. How much longer can we go on? And Carrying Alex makes this all the more difficult, but we couldn’t leave him behind, in fact, we need him. 

I'm not sure exactly how long we’ve been out here. How long ago did the storm start? How long ago did the mountain seem to collapse on us, snow swallowing everything recognizable? How long ago was Alex’s fall? I start spiraling when I think about these things, it’s better not to focus on them.  

Once the questions start I become helpless to their repetition. I obsessively go over what we should or could have done. Should we have stayed put longer? But we didn’t have anything left to spare to burn for warmth. Should we have tried to see if we could find more supplies? But I feel like we searched and salvaged what we could. Could we have prevented the fall? No, it wasn’t anyone’s fault. Could we have waited longer? I’m spiraling again, I’m about to scream. 

Then, thud, right in the head, a snowball hits me. “What the fuck Daniel!”  

It’s becoming dark now. We’ve gathered some wood and I’ve been gathering and hanging on to anything I can use for kindling, trying to keep it dry. The fire starter was one of the tools I had, unfortunately the flares were all in Alex’s bag. When he fell his bag fell further, it was unreachable. At least I thought so, Daniel disagreed. He seems more indifferent to surviving than he used to be. 

The fire is getting going I open my bag to pull out the meat. Daniel asks, “So, what’ll it be?” I suppose, trying to be funny. I say nothing. I slowly cut a hunk off of Alex’s calf, sparingly, but we are also pretty hungry. I place it on the fire carefully. We’ve split the pieces between us for the purpose of carrying more efficiently. It’s been some time now since he passed. After he fell, we did our best to stop the bleeding. We tried to care for him, wait out everything. Some of the days were so cold and relentlessly windy that melting the snow to drink was almost impossible and eating it didn’t satisfy much of anything. But with so much liquid around I was really more concerned with what we would eat. We ran out of food not long before he died.  

We still have a decent bit of him left, but I hate to waste anything. So, as I’m watching it cook, I feel I have to say something. “You really shouldn’t be throwing food around you know.” I say without looking up from cooking duty. 

Daniel wrinkles his nose up, eyebrows furrowing. Then scowling he tilts his head sideways to show how baffled he is by what I’m saying. Though I know he’s not confused he’s just pissed that I said something. “What... waste?” he replies agitatedly. 

“You were trying to feed that fox, I saw wha..”  

 He cuts in, “It was a fucking finger are you seriously gonna eat..” 

“Do you seriously think you’re going to catch a fox dumbass” I cut in back at him. 

I eat silently, angrily. Daniel chews mouth open like a child, starring off vacantly. I wonder if he’s trying to irritate me. I’m not sure he’s the person I thought him to be. 

Biting through the rough skin proved challenging. I charred it to a blackened crisp because I feel that is better than undercooking it. It was chewy, tough, muscly. Tonight, the mountain is quiet. The only sounds besides that of our gnawing are the faint gusts of wind blowing peacefully. I try to pay attention to other things while eating. 

I stare up at the sky for a moment before burrowing back into the sleeping bag to try to sleep. In that moment I remember how Daniel would sob at night. In my head it plays out in a voice so pathetic and cowardly. “Why isn’t anyone coming?” he’d say. I remember how Alex, while suffering and dying, would console this selfish baby. 

Getting up the next day is more difficult than anything ever has been. Not because I want to go back to sleep. The sun is especially bright, blinding. It’s that the pain in my feet is so immense that standing seems impossible. I can’t look at my feet, not that I want to, but my socks are stuck like they’ve been grafted to me. I finally get to my feet with a loud roar of agony.  

And we walk on and as we move the pain moves to numbness. I can’t imagine this is a good thing. The wind is picking up as well. I can see a small grove of little trees. And I tell Daniel we should take a rest there. He keeps going, paying no attention to me. I yell to him that I’m going over there. My legs are about to give out and the wind is biting my face.  

As I approach the grove I look toward the blinding light. Then wham! Right in my face another snowball. “Dammit Daniel! that one really..” I pause because I realize I’m bleeding. I stumble, catch my balance and a glimpse of something running past me. My head and body feel light. Between the blood in my eyes and the blinding white, I can barely see. “Daniel what the fuck are you doing?!” I exclaim exhaustedly as I collapse into the tiny trees. 

I can see a silhouette of Daniel standing above me. Then I hear it! It’s the sound of a helicopter! I try to scream, and I see Daniel is moving toward it. I can hear him screaming “Help us please!” It’s getting closer I can feel the wind from its blades. I don’t know why Daniel was acting this way, but I don’t care because I’m surviving, this nightmare is ending.  

Suddenly an excruciating pain in my head like a metal stake driven through my skull. And now I hear nothing, I don’t feel anything. Wait, I can hear something, but where is the helicopter? Like being pulled out of a dream, suddenly I can see. Through the blinding white and red I see Daniel on top of me, his knife slicing through me.
