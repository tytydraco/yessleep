I shouldn’t have taken the job.

I tell myself that a lot these days. Not out loud, not in a mirror — I don’t have the nerve for that anymore. But the thought rings in my head like a bad radio frequency every time I close my eyes: you shouldn’t have taken the job.

I was a grad student with a specialty no one cared about: medieval codices, obscure languages, half-forgotten scribes who lived and died by candlelight. My professors used to say my thesis was the kind of thing people skim over in footnotes and forget.

And then I got the email.

A private collector in New England. Anonymous. Said he had something “rare.” Said my name had been recommended. Offered me six months of work, quiet, paid in cash.

I didn’t need to ask what it was. I already knew. Everyone in my field knows.

The Voynich Manuscript.

I expected to find disappointment — some high-grade facsimile, another imitation meant to keep the myth alive. What I found instead was the real thing. Not behind glass, not in some climate-controlled vault, but laid bare in a cedar trunk, wrapped in linen that smelled of smoke.

I remember my fingers trembling as I unwrapped it. The calfskin stiff but alive with the grease of centuries. The ink sharp, darker than it had any right to be after five hundred years.

And the drawings. Always the drawings.

Naked women waist-deep in impossible pools. Plants that never grew on this earth. Constellations that refuse to map to any sky. The words dancing between them in script that shouldn’t exist, like someone had taken Latin, Hebrew, Greek, and crushed them together until the meaning bled out.

I told myself I wouldn’t get lost in it. That I’d do the work, catalogue what I could, and collect my money.

That was three months ago.

Now the script is burned into my eyelids. I see it in coffee stains, in raindrops, in the cracks on my ceiling. The letters rearrange themselves every time I look away. My notebooks are a graveyard of half-translations, none of which agree with each other.

But sometimes… sometimes, I know I’m close.

There are pages that don’t sit right. One in particular. A foldout map, covered in loops and funnels that look less like geography and more like plumbing. Tubes feeding into chambers, chambers feeding into pits, everything flowing downward like water down a drain.

The women in those drawings aren’t bathing. They’re sinking.

I tried tracing the map once. I set my pen to the top left corner and followed it down. By the time I reached the center, my wrist was bleeding. Not a scratch. Not a cut. Just blood, as if the act of following the path had pulled it out of me.

I burned that page. I shouldn’t have. But the thing about burning is that the image never really dies. It just changes color. Now, every time I close my eyes, I see the map glowing red in the dark.

And the worst part? I think I understand pieces now. Just words. Fragments.

The vessel.

The root.

The marrow.

The keeper.

The drawings of the women — they’re not random. They’re not even women, not really. They’re diagrams. Anatomical. Not human anatomy. Something older. Something stretched across centuries and skinned alive in ink.

Two nights ago, I woke to find the manuscript open on my desk. I hadn’t left it that way. A single word had been written in the margin in fresh ink, still wet when I touched it.

My name.

I don’t remember screaming. I only remember the taste of blood in my mouth and the sense that someone had been sitting at my desk, quill in hand, waiting for me to notice.

Since then, I can’t shake the feeling that the manuscript isn’t describing something. It’s inviting me to it.

I started dreaming in its alphabet. Not reading—speaking. The words roll off my tongue like I’ve known them longer than English, longer than breathing. I wake up gasping, the taste of copper in my mouth, like the sounds themselves are cutting me from the inside.

The diagrams don’t stay still anymore. I’ll look at them, and the ink shifts like tidewater. Roots stretch. Pools deepen. Figures lower themselves further into the funnels, arms outstretched toward something beneath the parchment. Something that was always there, waiting for the right set of eyes.

Two nights ago, my neighbor pounded on the wall at 3 A.M., swearing at me for “chanting.” I wasn’t chanting. I was asleep. But when I checked my voice recorder the next morning, I heard myself. A rasping whisper, repeating the same string of words over and over in that impossible script.

Marrow. Keeper. Vessel. Open.

When I listened again, slower, I swear I heard a second voice joining mine.

Last night was worse.

The manuscript was on the floor, wide open, though I’d locked it away in the trunk. The new page was still there—the faceless figure hunched over the book. But now, beneath it, the letters had shifted again.

I translated what I could. It wasn’t much. Just a phrase.

You are already written.

I slammed the manuscript shut. Threw it into the trunk. Buried the trunk in the basement under concrete bags until my arms gave out. I thought if I could cover it in enough weight, I could bury whatever it was trying to pull out of me.

But tonight, when I came back upstairs, my desk lamp was already on. A single page was waiting there. Not parchment. Printer paper. My printer had spat it out, humming happily like it had done nothing wrong.

The same faceless figure stared back at me. The script wrapped around it like a halo. But this time, the letters had become clear.

It wasn’t the manuscript anymore. It was my handwriting.

And the phrase was no translation. No puzzle. Just English.

Read aloud.

I didn’t. I couldn’t. My lips trembled around the shape of the first word, and my chest seized like something inside me was clawing for escape. I crumpled the page and burned it in the sink. But the smoke curled upward in the shape of letters, perfect letters, before dissolving into the ceiling.

And as the ash flaked into the drain, I realized I knew the words anyway. Every syllable. Every break. I didn’t need the page anymore.

I can hear the manuscript whispering from under the concrete. Not words this time. Breathing. Waiting.

And I think I finally understand what all of this has been building toward. The Voynich Manuscript isn’t a book. It’s a mirror. A trap. A lineage.

Someone had to keep it alive. Someone had to carry the next verse.

Now it’s me.

I know how this sounds. I know what kind of people come here, and I know how this will read — another half-mad rant from someone who dug too deep into a thing best left alone. But this isn’t a ghost story or a campfire tale.

I’m writing this here because I can’t trust anyone else with it. And because if you start seeing the symbols too — in your dreams, in your coffee stains, in the cracks on your ceiling — maybe you’ll recognize them before it’s too late.

I don’t care if you believe me. I only care that when the manuscript finds you, you’ll remember I tried to warn you.

Because once the words learn your mouth, you do not own them.

They carve themselves into the marrow, until you are less flesh than inscription.

And when the last breath leaves you, the book does not close.

It simply turns the page.
