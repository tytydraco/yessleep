TW: guns and alcohol

I wasn’t expecting any mail that day, but still, I wasn’t too surprised when a letter fell through the flap in my door onto the floor. I just walked over and picked it up, thinking it was a bill or something like that. It was actually an invitation to a party. I didn’t exactly know the person whose name was on the invite, but I figured it was a friend of a friend. The rest of the day was normal.

When I woke up the next morning, I ate my breakfast, went to work, came home and sat down to watch TV. Then my phone went off, reminding me that the party was in half an hour. I quickly got changed and examined the invitation one more time to get the address. After that I was in the car and on my way.

On the drive, I noticed that I hadn’t ever been this way. It was deserted and although my GPS still recognized it as a road, it was lagging out. Like, the little car icon was disappearing for seconds at a time before reappearing again. 
“Weird,” I thought, but I continued the drive anyway.

When I eventually saw the house where the party was, I was shocked. This was more like a building dedicated solely to parties than a house. There was a pool, a grill, and it had a huge backyard. The house was at least 3 stories tall and massive.

I hopped out of my car and walked up to the door. It opened before I could knock and I pushed on it slightly. Already the stench of alcohol hit me in the face but it wasn’t surprising. I opened it all the way and saw what could only be described as a rager. People were dancing to the EDM that filled the air. There was a white folding table with red plastic cups that I assumed were filled with drinks. I walked over and picked one up. I didn’t recognize anyone there, but I wasn’t gonna leave just yet. A girl strutted over to me and asked me to get her another drink.
“Umm… okay?” I said, picking up another cup from the table and handing it to her.
“Thanks” she slurred and turned around. She then threw the contents of the cup onto another girl.

What came next was a flurry of swears from the girl who was drenched in beer.
“Are you kidding me, Carla? It’s my birthday!” The girl screams.
Carla then smirked and said
“Oops, it was an accident, I promise.”
But the wet girl wasn’t buying it. She pulled out her phone and called who I could assume to be her partner. She was unintelligible as she yelled at him to get over to the party.

I just took a sip of my drink but almost spilled it all over myself as a huge, burly man burst through the door with a shotgun. I immediately ran out of the room and found the back exit. I was feeling dizzy, the eminent danger almost making me fall. I heard screams from inside and I jumped into my car and drove away.

As soon as I got home I just hopped into my bed and went to sleep, trying to forget what I’d just witnessed. I would’ve called the cops but I was already panicked enough and I thought there might be scenarios where I could be at fault. The next morning I got onto my laptop and searched up the address of the party. A news article popped up first, it read:
13 PEOPLE KILLED IN PARTY SHOOTING!
Recently there was an altercation between two girls at a party. This led to a boyfriend of one of the girls, who had a criminal record of assault and even an attempted murder charge, to bring a shotgun to the party and shoot and kill 13 people. Another 2 were injured.

I couldn’t believe that they had written a news article about it so fast, but then I looked at the date at the bottom of the post. 14th August, 2013. I was confused as the previous nights events had only happened one night ago. I continued digging and learned that there was no record of anything happening at that house in over 8 years, so what happened there? How did I go to a party there and experience events that happened 10 years ago? I don’t have words to describe my panic and worry that something is wrong with me.

Has this happened before to anyone? I’ve tried to use any app or search website I can but there’s nothing. I can’t think of anything better than to post it here so that maybe I can get help. Maybe someone will have a reasonable explanation for why this happened. But even if someone can make it all make sense, one thing’s for sure: I am NOT going to a party again.
