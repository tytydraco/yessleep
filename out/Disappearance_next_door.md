This is a true story. 

I live on a 140 year old studio house style cottage. It's on a piece of small land with 5 other very similar units and a laundry facility. They are in the historic district and protected to a degree, but not like the large fancy Victorian homes around us. But it's extremely affordable rent and I get to live in a very fancy part of town. I love going on walks and being able to look at all these grand old Victorian homes. I raised my kid here and the loot you get during Halloween trick-or-treating is phenomenal. Now my son's an adult and moved out and I'm here alone. 

2 years ago I got some unavailable neighbors in unit #3. They're addicts and formerly homeless. They got some kind of grant for their rent and being the cheapest place they were able to move in here and basically pay nothing monthly. Their bills are covered, their rent is covered. They panhandle around the nearby busy streets and use all that money for partying. 

They are a problem. They have strangers in and out all hours of the night and day. There's frequent drug use. And these tenants are coming and going all day every day bringing back huge piles of refuse and garbage in their wagon that gets piled up high through their home but also around and behind it, spilling into neighbor's yards. There's garbage everywhere now. And they have this annoying habit of filling all six of the garbage cans completely full the day that garbage is picked up so that nobody else has space for their trash. All of us and neighboring homes have had issues with thefts, packages going missing, bikes stolen. My son's bike was almost stolen by sometime breaking down the wooden picket fence it was chained to before they realized the chain was through both tires and they couldn't ride it away. We had to do that because he's had tires and his seats stolen multiple times. They've let their homeless friends take up residency in the laundry room giving them keys and they've trashed the place and cut hoses so we can't even use the facilities. 

Because of this, I got a ring camera on my back door, which faces a little walk through between the laundry facilities and my place. I have a front door one. And I have an old phone using a free security camera app taped up in my living room window that faces the street and sidewalk so I have all areas covered for the most part. My neighbor directly across from me also has cameras so we basically cover the entire front of the property.

Lately things have gotten stranger than usual. Like I had mentioned I have have lived next to these people for 2 years and it is a daily occurrence that they are in and out. There has NEVER been a single day that has gone by that I didn't see either the husband or the wife on my cameras. This Monday I got home from work at 6 and I overheard officers knocking at their door. That's not uncommon, police coming by is almost a weekly activity because of these tenants. 

The next morning, I hear it again. I can hear them yelling welfare check. This was unusual. And concerning. I left for work and during my break I checked the cameras. To my surprise, I saw her walking to her house at 7:30pm Sunday, her husband arriving on his bike at 8:30pm. And then nothing at all from them on either camera. That was strange. Nobody answered the door during the welfare check. 

This concerned me because few months ago the wife had caught me up in a conversation I couldn't avoid outside while watering my plants. She had asked me for some shoes, because her husband had thrown all hers out. She was incredibly high and barely able to make a coherent sentence so it was hard to understand what she was saying, but apparently he had put a very strong lock with a key on the inside of the door to keep management from coming in, and they had lost the key and have been using the windows to get in and out for a few days. They had accidentally broken multiple windows and they were no longer on the tracks so she can't close and secure her house. It's over 100Â° f and their house is boiling hot inside. She said she couldn't call management to get it fixed because he doesn't want management over because of their drug use and when she tried to he broke her phone and now she has no phone. She went and stayed with family for a few days and when she got back all of her things were tossed. At least all of the things he could find because there's so much garbage in the house. 

I gave her a pair of flip-flops and an extremely large old Stanley thermos. I filled with ice and water for her and told her she could just keep it. Then, she told me that her husband has been very dark lately, full of dark spirit. And that one of their frequent visitors has a crush on her husband and she thinks that women had planted cursed objects to cause them to fight in the little patch of dirt in front of their home, and she was going to go taking up the entire area to find it and remove it. It honestly sounded like cracktivities so I didn't put much mind to that but the parts about her husband's violence and disrespect stuck with me. It's not as if she was without help though, whatever program they were in, they had a dedicated case manager who came by frequently and brought them food and referred them to services. She had family nearby enough to go to when things got hard. I honestly wanted to keep as much space between us as possible so I did not interact with them frequently and did not remain open for conversation long. I was polite but firm and protective of my life and privacy. 

So with that in mind, the sudden and unusual absence of the pair and their visitors was a little concerning to me. Especially following multiple welfare check attempts that continued to go unanswered. 

Over the next two days, officers were coming by four times a day attempting to conduct a welfare check. And through that time, I had seen the husband leave and return home twice. I have concerns yes, but I also considered maybe she left to be with family again. But then, who called in a welfare check? If it was the husband he wouldn't avoid the house and answering the door. I don't think anybody regularly visiting isn't any state of mind to even be aware. Something was wrong but if it was them, they know how to get in that house and look around. They know the door to the fork and the windows are always open. They are not the type to be shy about entering his house when he's not home, that was always a regular occurrence. They could go in and check.

 I had also seen a strange man arrive on bike and then leave with a VERY large heavy looking black bag. He attempted to walk the bike away with this large bag slung awkwardly over his shoulder. That was at 4am Friday morning. This was my day off, and I had been checking all my cameras looking to see If there was any video of his wife actually leaving the house after she arrived Sunday night. There was none. Now there's always the possibility that the cameras might not catch something where they don't record it so I ask my neighbor if she would just check her footage. And that was very little help because she is is weird in her own way and incredibly spacey, So she sent me dozens of videos of activity that had nothing to do with what I asked. But I sifted through everything. I called up the neighbor across for me who sent me the footage and told her my concerns. As I started explaining it more, it seemed to be even more frightening. And as we discussed and processed it together over the phone, I felt more inclined to believe that something had happened to this woman. And I started feeling really horrible for letting so much time pass in between making excuses and refusing to believe something like this could happen right next door to me. If something did happen, god forbid, that time I let pass might have been enough to stop it. 

Two officers arrived to doing their next welfare check at around 7pm Friday evening, soon after I had compliled all the relevant videos and timeline of events and spoken with my neighbor. I had waited a little while as they knocked before heading outside to greet them. They initiated first asking if I had seen the wife anytime recently and if she seemed to be out of sorts. Now I'm not trying to be a snitch or throw anybody under the bus but I did say she always seen out of sorts The last time I had seen her on video was Sunday. I showed them the videos. Before I had a chance to explain the timeline of events and my concerns, my other neighbor across from me came out with her own videos and told the officers that just 2 hours before her. She had seen the woman arrive on bike and rush right into the house. She was showing the officers the video and the woman did not look like the wife, it didn't look like anybody who had come by before either. She had roughly the same build but her hair was completely chopped off and bright blonde where the wife had very long dark hair. She was wearing clothing. I had never seen the wife have before and arrived on the husband's bike with the husband on the bike with her where the wife has her own bike which was out and available for use next to the house and it's not a very good video. It's a little difficult to see. So she had not considered it was the wife to begin with. However, this video told the officers that they were in the house. 

They had continued knocking as we went back inside our own homes. And then melon's later. There was about 25 officers all around. They had multiple dogs barking and ready to go. They were threatening to force entry and yelling that they had a warrant for the wife. They still did not come to the door. My neighbor came out and told them that the door had been stuck closed and they didn't have a key to open it so they used the windows. The officers got very annoyed with her and showed her back to her home and continued ordering she come out. No one does. 

The stand off was oddly long for the circumstances. 45 minutes of these officers yelling to come out or they will force entry, but they never did. Then finally, the door opens up and the wife appears. She had cut her hair and changed her style, even wrapping her arms up with bandages where she had visible tattoos. They dragged her out and also her husband. She had tried to explain that she had just been in the hospital and they cannot take her in, she was even trying to throw around paperwork and kick the officers away. This was untrue as I could hear on my cameras that the paperwork was aftercare instructions for a dog and dated over a year prior, which was just a funny thing to add but not really a deterrent for officers picking you up for a warrant. 

So there was a lot of commotion and I felt pretty silly jumping to conclusions. But I guess you never know what could happen. And I'm very glad I was wrong. Honestly, I think it taught me that I needed to be more aware of what's going on around me because if I had been correct and didn't act on it sooner I would have regretted that for the rest of my life. 

I have absolutely no idea what she was arrested for and apparently the husband is on probation and I have no idea what for either. I'm sure we can surmise some guesses, but that kind of turn out seems somewhat heavy-handed for lower mail stealing or drug use charges. Wish I couldn't tie this all up with a satisfying ending, I guess that's just how that life goes. I don't know, if I do ever find out more information maybe I will come back and update if anyone cares. I will certainly accept all the shame I might get for not doing something sooner as well. Just thought I would share this.
