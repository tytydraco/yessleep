To say I was worried when I got back to school that Monday would be an understatement, I was super fucking anxious, and for so many reasons. The memory of what happened to Elizabeth and I the day before, the, I don’t know, hundreds of questions that came with it, and that would probably find no answers, all this was running through my head endlessly.

 

There was also the simple fact that, the last time I saw Elizabeth, she was covered in bandages, covering deep wounds that would be hard to explain. If she came to school looking like the day before, I don’t know how she would explain that to people, and everyone knew we spent Sunday together for the homework.

 

The night before, when I got back to my place, the urge to text her to see how she was and if we remembered the same events was hard to resist, especially when I received a notification telling me that she started following me on Instagram, but she clearly told me before leaving “Not today, another day.” So, I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

 

When I got to school on that morning, I was looking everywhere for Elizabeth. I eventually saw her when we were all waiting in front of the classroom for the teacher to arrive. She was wearing all her bandages, and all of her friends surrounded her pretty fast when they saw her. I could hear them asking questions, and, of course, they gave me a lot of looks in the beginning. I don’t know what she told them, but they soon stopped. She was putting on a smiling and carefree face, but I noticed that her hand was slightly shaking.

 

The teacher finally arrived, and we started entering the classroom. I waited for Elizabeth to pass besides me so I could have a word, but when I tried to open my mouth, she lifted her hand in front of my face and whispered.

 

“Not now, meet me at lunch. In the meantime, I fell down the stairs, okay?”

 

I nodded yes. What else could I do.

 

Hours went by, and, before I knew it, it was lunch. I realized we didn’t had a meeting place, but figured it would be where we had our first one the week before. I joined her there. We sat, and for a moment, we stayed silent. I guess neither one of us knew where to start. Eventually, I started to speak.

 

“So, what do you remember from yesterday?” I asked.

 

“I don’t know what I remember, if I’m being honest, I think I don’t want to believe it, because that would make me crazy…” She answered.

 

“Well, I mean, I think I understand you, so, maybe you could tell me what your memories are so we can both be reassured.” I said.

 

She sighed.

 

“I remember my name, all the pictures, the paintings, they were saying it, and their hands, piercing their frame, coming towards me, hurting me… So, yeah, that’s what I remember.”

 

I was reassured. She remembered the same things I did, so, I wasn’t going insane.

 

“Yeah, that’s pretty much what I remember too. So, now, what are we doing?”

 

She looked at me, eyes wide open.

 

“Huh, nothing, there’s no chances I’m stepping in that house ever again.”

 

On that, she left. I could understand her reaction, especially since she came out of it harmed, but a part of me was still curious to figure out what happened and see what else this house was hiding.

 

Eventually, art-history class arrived, and the teacher asked every group to give a little feedback on how our first visit went. When our turn came, Elizabeth took the lead and explained that we had a talk with the owner but had to stop the visit after that because she fell down the stairs. Our teacher looked worried. He then explained to everyone that those who didn’t have enough material to complete the work could go back the next day. At the end of the class, Elizabeth went straight to the teacher, and they talked a little bit. She then left the room and Mr. Joseph came to me. He told me that Elizabeth had asked him to come with us to the house, as she didn’t feel safe there, and that he accepted.

 

I came home that day, and prepared myself for the next day. I wanted to know more about this house. I didn’t find much the first time, but maybe if I dug deeper, I would find more. The first thing I did was going back to the story that some guy had posted about his experience when he stayed there one summer. This was posted a few years ago, but I still decided to reach out to him, simply asking him if he was still active.

 

I then scrolled down in the search results for some time, hoping to find something interesting, but just like before, I didn’t find much.

 

So, I’ll skip to today, the day of the second visit. After class, Elizabeth, Mr. Jospeh and I met in front of the house. When we were all there, Mr. Joseph knocked, and the old lady opened to us. She looked a bit sad, and sorry when her eyes landed on Elizabeth’s bandages.  
  
We got in, and Mr. Joseph and the owner had a little talk, explaining the reasons of his presence. I heard she was apologizing, and he was reassuring her. Elizabeth and I, we didn’t wait in that hallway and went straight to the living room and sat. We gave each other a few looks, and eventually, Mr. Joseph and the owner came back.

 

“So, I will stay here with Miss, and you two can continue your visit. If there’s any problem, you can call me.” He said.

 

We both nodded yes, and slowly went to the stairs. We technically still inspected the main floor, so next was the 1^(st) floor. We passed through the hallway and Elizabeth accelerated. I stopped and looked at the painting of the old lady. The only one that didn’t do anything last time, but that I thought I saw move a little. She was still smiling like last time, and it still looked like she was watching me. Again, I could swear that she was smiling more as time went on.

 

“Joshua. Come!” Elizabeth whispered.

 

I followed her upstairs, and, without a word, we started taking notes in the first room. It was an old but pretty bedroom. We looked at everything, I took a few pictures too.  
  
We were ready to go to the next room, when the door suddenly closed itself. We both looked at each other, already scared. With what happened last time, this wasn’t announcing anything good. Elizabeth went to the door and tried to open it, but it wasn’t moving. I gave it a try myself, and it was absolutely unmovable, more than locked, it was like it was stuck to the wall. We started to panic, and I yelled our teacher’s name, but we got no answers.

 

Soon, the two of us were punching the door, and screaming. We were suddenly caught off guard by a soft voice coming from behind us.

 

“Hello you two…”

 

We turned in a second. I immediately recognized her. It was the young woman in the painting. She was still smiling, a pretty smile, she almost looked kind and friendly. Elizabeth and I had our back on the wall, and we fell on the floor out of fear. We were both sitting on the ground, sobbing and almost suffocating.

 

“Elizabeth, Joshua, welcome to my house. I can’t tell you how happy I am to have guests like you.”

 

We weren’t making a sound except the ones of our heavy and fast breathing.

 

“Elizabeth, I have to apologize to you for last time. All my… friends, they were a little bit too eager to get to know you, I’ll make sure that doesn’t happen again.”

 

She turned her eyes to me.

 

“And you’re Joshua, aren’t you? I haven’t seen a boy around my age in a while…”

 

She started to approach me. She placed herself in front of me, just a few centimeters away, got down to my level and smiled. I was terrified, petrified by the fear.

 

“Don’t be scared, I won’t hurt you too much.”

 

That wasn’t exactly reassuring me.

 

“I’ll even give you a little something in return, to make up for the pain.”

 

She placed her hands on my legs, and her nails elongated, piercing my skin and going deeper. I started to scream out of pain, but was cut. She just kissed me. A long, passionate kiss, as she stuck her tongue in my mouth. The surprise almost made me forget the pain. Like the dumbass I am, I instinctively responded to her kiss (I’m a bit ashamed of saying that, but that was my official first kiss). I don’t know how long it lasted, but she eventually stopped, and her nails got back to normal. The pain came back as soon as it ended and I was bleeding a lot.

 

“I hope you enjoyed it, I kinda did… I’ll leave you for now, I suggest you go downstairs…”

 

On that she entered a closet and disappeared. Elizabeth and I looked at each other, completely shocked. We were both shaking, and my eyes were tearing because of the pain. The door opened and we got up and ran downstairs.

 

In the hallway, we found Mr. Joseph sitting on the floor and shaking too, covered in wounds. We both understood what must have happened to him. He looked at us and succeeded to form a phrase.

 

“You, follow me, we’re leaving now.”

 

We all got to the door, and tried to open it, but it was completely stuck, just like before, in the bedroom. Mr. Joseph tried as hard as he could, but the door wasn’t showing any signs of weakness. I turned to the painting of the young lady, and she was just like before.

 

After some long minutes, Mr. Joseph stopped trying, and we got to the windows. That’s when we all understood that our situation was extremely complicated. On the other side of the windows, there was no street anymore, it was just a forest. Trees, leaves on the ground, a forest. We all looked at each other in disbelief.

 

Mr. Joseph tried to break the glass as hard as he could, going as far as hitting it with a chair, but it didn’t break it, not even a single crack. After some long minutes, we took a break, and talked.

 

Elizabeth and I explained to our teacher what happened to us last time, and today. He then told us what happened to him while we were upstairs. He was talking with the owner, when she said that she had to take out the trash. She got out of the house and he looked at the pictures and paintings in the hallway. Then, it happened to him what happened to Elizabeth last time: the whispers, the pictures moving, the hands coming out of the frames, scratching him, piercing his skin.

 

We talked a bit more, but soon Mr. Joseph started to hit all the windows again. I instinctively checked if I still had an internet connection, and I did. My first thought was to contact my friends. I tried to explain to them what was happening to us, but they all thought I was joking, even after I sent them pictures and videos. I was hopeless, but I knew that one person would believe me: Rosa, my little sister. I hesitated, but whatever we stumbled into was dangerous, and I didn’t want my young little sister to get involved. I decided to tell her that I was going to stay at a friend's house for the night. She was probably going to spend the evening alone, since our mom was working late, and, even with everything that was happening to me, my instinct still wanted to protect her.  
  


Elizabeth also tried to contact her friends, but from what she told me, nobody believed her too. After, maybe two hours of stress and panic, we all sat, and Mr. Joseph even fell asleep on a couch. He must have been very tired to fall asleep in that situation. I felt tired too, but the fear was too strong.

 

My legs were still bleeding. With all the confusion, I didn’t cover them with anything. Elizabeth noticed it too.

 

“Do you want me to put you some bandages?”

 

I said that I could do it myself, but that I’d like it if she could bring some to me, as I wanted to avoid walking too much. She went to look in the kitchen and came back with a little kit. She gave it to me, and gave me a strange look. She then leaned towards me and kissed me. I was surprised, and after responding again, because I’m stupid, I softly pushed her away. I was confused.

 

“What the hell?” I said.

 

“What?” She asked. She looked confused too.

 

“Well, why would you even do that?” I asked.

 

“God, I don’t know. It looks like we’re about to die, so, I guess I don’t want to die without having kissed someone, I DON’T KNOW!” She was clearly nervous.

 

“We’re not gonna die! And if we do, it’s done, you kissed someone now, so, if you all could stop kissing me without warning me, it would be nice okay?!” I was clearly nervous too.

 

“How do you know we’re not gonna die?!”

 

“I guess I try to be optimistic me!”

 

We were both exhausted and nervous. She was so close to me, and as we looked at each other, we kissed again. For a little longer this time. We suddenly stopped and got away from each other. We both looked confused now.

 

“Let’s just stop there maybe?” I said.

 

“Yeah, you’re right.” She answered.

 

We were clearly both making random things to distract ourselves. I am clearly not into her, and, as far as I know, she’s not into me either, so, yes, we didn’t wanted things to escalate too much.

 

She started to sleep too, or at least tried to, as it was getting darker outside. I got out my charger and plugged my phone. Fortunately, there was still electricity.

 

Since I’m unable to sleep, I figured I should update you all, so I’m writing this as Mr. Joseph and Elizabeth are sleeping. If any of you have any questions or advice, I’m all ears.
