The first several hours were spent tramping through this Florida forest swamp. I'd stopped to drink water from a stream, not sure if this was safe. I decided it was worth the risk.

  


The sun was already sinking beneath the treeline when I exited the forest and found myself walking in the tall grass next to a highway. I decided to stick to the tall grass and the trees. I knew I looked like a mess after tramping through that forest for hours. And I was paranoid that a cop might pull over and ask questions, which would then lead to him finding out I was a runaway.

  


My stomach rumbled. It had been several hours since breakfast, and I wondered how I would find my next meal. I didn't have any money, see. So I could beg or I could steal, I suppose. Neither sounded very appetizing.

  


Despite my efforts, I was spotted a few times by drivers. A few looked in my direction, scowling through sunglasses (okay, that was just one guy) and a couple raised their hands in greeting as their car passed. One cop car went past (I stood very still among the weeds until it left) but the cop inside didn't even turn to glance in my direction.  But that was when it was somewhat sunny. Now the sun was gone, and I feared less on getting spotted by someone. Now I just wanted to get to the nearest town. Still not sure what I'd do for food.

  


A thing moved in the woods to my right. Not sure what it was, I stood still and looked into the weeds where I'd heard the movement. A pair of bright blue eyes stared back at me. Not human eyes. This looked more like a cat's. I was sure I could even make out the outline of its pointed ears.

  


The headlights of an approaching car scared it away before I could get a clearer look. It bounded deeper into the woods.

  


“Watch out for alligators!” I called out. “This is Florida, you know. Cats shouldn't be wandering around at night on their own."

  


Neither should you. The thought entered my head. What choice do I have? I answered myself. “Should I have just stayed with ICE? Of course not."

  


So preoccupied was I in my own thoughts that I barely noticed the car coming up on my side until it was parking on the side of the road next to me. I jumped in alarm, prepared to flee.

  


"Hey,” called a girl, effectively ending my plan of escape. I turned to face her out of curiosity.

  


She looked to be around 20 years old, but I could have been either direction a year or two. She was thin and had brown eyes and pale white skin. Her skin was so pale that I did a double take, then realized that it was Gothic makeup. Her lipstick, eyeliner, and nails were black and her hair was the blackest thing of all. From her shoulders down she wore a black Victorian style dress and a black Victorian collar was around her neck. The window on the passenger side of the car was rolled down and she was leaning from her spot in the driver's seat in my direction. “Are you all right?”

  


“I'm fine,” I lied, though I knew I looked a mess.

  


Gothic girl regarded me with a dubious, raised eyebrow. (Her eyebrows were a little arched and accentuated her expression.) “Are you sure you wouldn't like a ride? It's a long way to town.”

  


I stared at her in surprise. A few thoughts went through my head at once. What kind of person offers a ride to a stranger who wasn't even asking? Usually adult men wanting to take advantage of children. Neither one of us fit that category. Secondly, was it really a long way to town? I didn't want to be walking all night. My legs were killing me. Thirdly, might this nice Goth be willing to help me find a meal?

  


“I would very much like a ride,” I answered. “If it wouldn't be too much trouble.”  
She smiled easily and opened the passenger door from inside. “Please enter my car, sir. It's no trouble at all.”

  


It was only then that I noticed the car's color. Red. I'd half expected black. My eyes instantly went to the clock. It was 6:45.

  


I entered the car and closed the door. “Thank you,” I said, looking forward and feeling more than a little awkward. Awkward, but relieved.

  


“You're welcome,” she replied, and she extended her hand towards me. with an easy smile “I'm Raven.”

  


I shook it. “Gabriel.”

  


Raven looked over her shoulder, signaled left, and merged back into the road.    I looked around the car. It was a small vehicle, with two seats in the front and two in the back. “Nice car,” I commented absentmindedly.

  


“It's my mom's” replied Raven, turning to give me a quick look. “She let me drive it down all the way from Minnesota. I'm vacationing with my friend.”

  


“Oh, you're from Minnesota? So am I!”

  


“No wait, really?” Raven beamed at me. “That's awesome. I'm actually originally from Australia, by the way. What are you doing down here?”

  


“Well...”

  


The discomfort must have shown on my face, because Raven hurriedly said “You don't have to say if you don't want. It's none of my business.”

&#x200B;

  
I considered before replying.   “I think it is your business since you offered me a ride,” I replied slowly. “I'll tell you everything.”  And I did. I know what you're thinking. Yes, it might look stupid. But I told her. Maybe it was the lack of food and the mental exhaustion I was feeling. Maybe it was because she was a pretty girl or maybe I was just thankful for the ride. Take your pick.

&#x200B;

  
Raven listened with rapt attention, and when I was done, she let out a long exhale.   “Thank you for sharing that with me,” she said after a few moments pause. “I am SO glad I found you, Gabriel. I'm an ally, so don't worry about anything. You've had some terrible experiences and I am so sorry. Please, don't worry about those ICE fascists. I hate them as much as you do. If there's anything else I can do for you...”

&#x200B;

  
I nodded, feeling relieved that she wasn't some “law and order” ICE fan. Though I didn't think she'd be, based on her appearance. An idea occurred to me. “I hate to ask for more favors, but -”

&#x200B;

  
“Ask away,” interrupted Raven.    She held her head high and sat up so straight her back may as well have been a ruler.

&#x200B;

  
“Well in that case, could I burrow a few dollars to buy a meal and maybe rent a hotel room? I haven't eaten since breakfast. I'm sorry.”

&#x200B;

  
“I'll pay for all that, don't worry,” Raven replied, and I saw her eyes light up. “Look, we're here.” She gestured with her head towards the sign welcoming us into town.

&#x200B;

  
“What about you, Raven?” I asked, curious about this kindhearted Goth. “You mentioned you were on vacation?”

&#x200B;

  
“Oh yes, me and my friend Lilly. We're staying in the same hotel. We're going to the Wizarding World tomorrow. You can stay at our hotel if you like. I'll buy you another room.”

&#x200B;

  
“Sounds great,” I said, very happy with how things had turned out. I wasn't out of the woods  yet, but I was getting there.

&#x200B;

  
A small alarm went off.

&#x200B;

  
“Oh, crap.” Raven groaned. “I need gas.”

&#x200B;

  
Right on cue, a gas station was one of the first buildings we came across upon entering town. A thicket of trees lay beyond, and beyond them I saw the McDonald's arch and a few more neon signs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We pulled into the parking lot, but instead of going to the pumps, Raven parked on the parking spots. A police car was parked within the same parking lot, just two cars to the right. I tensed.

&#x200B;

  
“I need to buy a few things,” said Raven, turning to look at me. “Maybe you can buy something to eat, I'll pay. I only buy organic vegetarian food for myself, by the way.”

&#x200B;

  
I shook my head. “Pick something for me, okay? There's a cop car.” And I jerked my chin in its direction, not wanting to point.

&#x200B;

  
Raven turned to frown in its direction. “Okay. Don't worry, I won't take long. I'll be right back, promise.” She winked before exiting the car and entering the store.

&#x200B;

  
There was nothing to do except sit there nervously and wait for her to come back. I watched her through the brightly lit windows in the store, I watched her move about, putting things into a shopping basket and look around at things. I thought she looked like a dark angle, moving about in that black Victorian dress all gracefully. I wondered vaguely if I should have complimented her makeup.  


&#x200B;

But then I saw him. The cop. Tall and muscular and in a brown police uniform, there he stood, moving around the store. Gun in his belt. Check. To my horror, I saw him approach Raven.  Raven paused and turned to address the cop. I watched their facial expressions carefully. Raven's was neutral, the cop was smiling. After awhile, Raven broke into a smile too and they began chatting about something which must have been amusing.

&#x200B;

  
Whatever happened to hating them as much I did? I thought furiously. Technically he's not ICE, but he works with them!  


&#x200B;

It got worse. The cop turned and pointed in my direction, a serious look now in his face. Raven moved to stand directly in front of him (blocking my view of her expression and continued talking. The cop frowned and put his hands on his hips.  


&#x200B;

She's selling me out!  


&#x200B;

I was sure of it. Paranoid thoughts went through my brain. Why else would they be talking to each other, only to have the cop point in my direction? Why was Raven in there anyway? She'd said she needed gas, and an alarm did go off, but I hadn't turned to see if we really were out of gas. Come to think of it, why did she think to pick a stranger up at dark? Sure, she presented herself as a nice white liberal, but what if it was a ruse?  


&#x200B;

The conversation between Raven and the cop continued. Why did she need to talk to him for so long? I clenched my teeth together.  


&#x200B;

That's when I made the decision to scram. 

&#x200B;

But my wits hadn't left me completely, and so I dug my hands into Raven's glove compartment and in the small opening underneath her can holder. There was a bunch of makeup junk (which I left behind) but I also came away with a bunch of spare cash coming up to $52 dollars. I stuffed the cash in my pocket, made sure neither the cop nor Raven was looking, and then bolted out of the car. I didn't even bother to close the door, so fearful was I that they'd hear it and come running outside. Once I was out of the car, I dashed behind a gas pump and sneaked my way out of the parking lot and into the line of trees beyond.  


&#x200B;

Some of you might be angry that I stole from Raven. My defense at the moment was that I was sure she was turning me in, so she would be the one betraying me, not the other way around. And if she hadn't betrayed me? It sucked, but I don't think she'd mind too much...considering she'd offered to buy me a hotel room and food. That would have cost much more than $52.  


&#x200B;

The thought of the McDonald's beyond the treeline drove away any feelings of guilt.  


&#x200B;

The restaurant that I entered was not McDonald's. It looked like it. The yellow arch's were there. It was a fast food restaurant. But looking back, I don't think this was McDonald's. I just thought it was.  


&#x200B;

Empty lobby. Lights on. That's how I found it as a I entered.  


&#x200B;

An ordering machine sat on the center of the room. I walked up to it and spent all of Raven's money on burgers and fries. I figured I'd be on the run for a couple days, and I'd eat up the extra burgers tomorrow.  


&#x200B;

“We have received your order,” I read the message appearing on the screen out loud. “Please pick a table. Your pork will be arriving soon. It is coming.”  


&#x200B;

I nodded and went to sit at one of the tables in the back. It was next to the exit door. Just in case Raven or the cop walked in.  


&#x200B;

“OINK!!”  
I jumped in alarm and looked around for the pig. That sounded to realistic to be fake. But in no direction could I see a cow or anything else that could have made that noise.  


&#x200B;

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw movement. Turning, I was surprised to see a mechanical device with my tray of burgers moving towards me. It looked like a silver block with wheels and several side compartments. On the top was the tray.  


&#x200B;

“Epic,” I said happily, taking the tray from the robot and putting it on the table. There was also a cup. A message was written on its side:  


&#x200B;

THE PIG GIVES MILK  


&#x200B;

“So there is a pig,” I muttered, taking the cup and standing to look around. The only part of the restaurant hadn't entered was the back book...and the restrooms.  


&#x200B;

“OINK!!!”  


&#x200B;

This time, it definitely sounded like that was where it was coming from.  
“What the hell?!” I exclaimed, shaking my head in disbelief. This wasn't a REAL PIG, right?  Curious beyond belief, I walked over to the restroom.  


&#x200B;

“Girls?” I read the word on the door out loud. “But there's only one bathroom.”  
Pushing it cautiously open (cautious in case the PIG was actually real, or in case there was a girl), I peered inside and instantly saw the PIG.  


&#x200B;

It wasn't real. Well duh. I let out a breath of relief and moved into the restroom.  
The PIG was a vending machine. It was about as tall as one too. Tremendously obese – it sat on its butt with its fat belly sticking out in front of it. A tongue that looked rubbery was sticking out of its mouth and was moving. It looked like it was blowing in the wind, but of course there was no wind in here. Its eyes were red. Its uterus...that was where you got your drink from. (It seemed more like a mixture of a cow and a pig.) An OUT OF ORDER pager was plastered on its forehead.  


&#x200B;

“Weird,” I said, and going against my best judgment, I tried my luck anyway, hitting the red lemonade button. (Remembering, I hadn't drunken anything since morning.) The uterus felt rubbery.  


&#x200B;

“MOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!” exclaimed the PIG, so loudly that I recoiled in shock and spilled some of the liquid on the floor.  


&#x200B;

The pig's eyes had bulged out to nearly three times their original size.  


&#x200B;

“I see why you're out of order,” I muttered angrily. Those eyes were freakish. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Geez, I thought you were a pig, not a cow.”  


&#x200B;

I made a quick stop to go to the bathroom.  Once inside the stall, I noticed someone had written on the walls. There were several messages. Nearly every part of the wall was covered in words.  


&#x200B;

Another bad day?  


&#x200B;

Everyday here is a bad day.  


&#x200B;

I don't know why I stay. No, actually I do.  


&#x200B;

Money. But you could leave.  


&#x200B;

He got mad again. Very mad.  


&#x200B;

He's always mad.  


&#x200B;

This time was different. He started by telling us the pork wasn't as funny as it used to be. What a strange thing to say!  


&#x200B;

And one of the customers was acting strange. He wanted us to lick the pork before giving it to him. And he ordered...twenty hamburgers.  


&#x200B;

That's not normal.  


&#x200B;

EW! Did you do it?  


&#x200B;

I wasn't going to, but the boss came in and started yelling at me when he saw me preparing the hamburgers normally. “DIDN'T YOU HEAR THE CUSTOMER WANTED IT LICKED?! LICK IT, FUCK YOU, LICK IT!” Like, how did he knew the customer asked this, he wasn't around, at least I didn't see him when the customer ordered.  


&#x200B;

Woah But did you lick them?  


&#x200B;

I started to, but he was impatient with how slow I was. So he came up and licked my face to show me how it's done.  


&#x200B;

DISGUSTING! You should have punched him!  


&#x200B;

I was scared! You don't know what it's like. You don't know what he's like. I was frozen with fear. His tongue...it was big. And it had holes in it. After he was done, he growled and walked away. The customer winked at me when I gave him the burgers. I'm quitting! After today, I'm quitting!  


&#x200B;

Aren't you afraid he'll read these messages?  


&#x200B;

They're only napkins. You keep mine safe, right?  


&#x200B;

Oh no, here he comes.  


&#x200B;

I see him. He's got the pork.  


&#x200B;

Yes Yes he does.  


&#x200B;

I stared at the stall walls, and it was as if I was coming out of a trance. For a long moment, I just stared. Then I realized...there were no more messages.  
“Napkins?” I said blearily, the last of the mind fog slowly exiting my head. “But these aren't napkins.”  


&#x200B;

Sensing that I was done in the bathroom, I flushed the toilet and stumbled out of the bathroom, passing the PIG without a second thought.  


&#x200B;

It was not until I was outside the bathroom that I saw it: The men's bathroom. It was further down the hall, a little obscured by a turn in the wall. Safe to say I felt stupid, and more than a little glad that I seemed to be the only one in the restaurant.  


&#x200B;

The messages I'd read in the girl's bathroom were haunting me. I felt drawn to the men's bathroom, if only out of morbid curiosity.  


&#x200B;

There was no pig in the men's bathroom. Peaking cautiously inside the men's toilet stall, I was relieved to find no messages written on the walls. But just when I thought this bathroom was perfectly normal, I passed the urinal.  
Written in red on the inside of the urinal was a message and an illustration. I groaned.  


&#x200B;

Should have kept better care of your napkins --- The Boss  


&#x200B;

Underneath these words was a picture of a smiling cowboy's face.  


&#x200B;

This restaurant was starting to get on my nerves. As I left the the restrooms, I made the decision to eat quickly and leave. I didn't want to spend too much time in a place like this.  I went back to my table in the lobby.  


&#x200B;

Unwrapping the first burger, I was surprised to see a cartoon in the inside wrapper. The cartoon was of a muscular man made entirely out of pork. He was naked and had horns made out of a darker meet. His eyes were bulging red and reminded me the eyes of a fly. A speech bubble was coming out of his head.  
I'M MR. PORKMAN. EAT ME SO THAT I TOO MAY EAT. I WAS DEREGULATED IN JUNE 2019. I AM THE PORK.  


&#x200B;

“You know,” I muttered out loud, looking around. “I don't think McDonald's has a mascot like this.”  


&#x200B;

It was freaky, surreal, disturbing. But I was hungry, so I bit into the burger. It tasted good. I took another bite. This one tasted just as good. It was not until the fourth bite that I noticed the meat was wet. I ignored this and kept eating. After all, I hadn't eaten since morning.  


&#x200B;

That was when the door opened. I paused mid-bite and glanced at the cop who had just entered.  


&#x200B;

The cop grinned at me. It was the same cop Raven had been talking to. Fear entered every fiber of my being. I wondered if I should run or even fight. Immediately my mind shot those suggestions down. He had a gun. I would be murdered if I tried to resist.  


&#x200B;

“Howdy.” He sauntered over to my table and sat in the chair opposite mine. “Didn't take long to find you.”  


&#x200B;

“That witch,” I growled, anger rising within me.  


&#x200B;

The cop raised his eyebrows. “Cool it, criminal. That bleeding heart told me nothing. She tried to distract me. When I saw you run out of the car, I knew you were the illegal we'd been warned about. The one who escaped ICE and broke a man's nose. I would have hunted you down like a dog, if your little friend hadn't attacked me. She's handcuffed in my car right now.”  


&#x200B;

I felt a sense of shame sweep over me. It only lasted for a second. Replacing it was something else. Terror. Something was rising up inside of me, something evil.  


&#x200B;

“I AM THE PORK!!!!” I roared in rage. I jumped across the table and buried my teeth in the cop's throat.  


&#x200B;

“AHH!” he shouted as he flung me off him. My body crashed into the chair and toppled to the ground.  


&#x200B;

“Son of a-!” swore the cop, clutching at his bleeding throat. He pulled the gun from his belt, but by then I had already crashed into him again. I bit his wrist, making him drop the gun.  


&#x200B;

“I AM THE PORK!!! I AM THE PORK!!! I AM THE PORK!!! I AM THE PORK!!!!” I roared again and again, and I bit his throat again. This time it was ripping from his throat. He toppled the ground, dead or dying.  


&#x200B;

None of this was my doing. I was possessed, possessed by Mr. Porkman. I could feel him inside me. I rejected him with all my being. I was horrified. Yet I could not stop him.  


&#x200B;

My body bent down over the dead cop. I found myself licking his wound. I cupped my hands where the blood was pouring out and drank it. When I had had my fill, I hoisted the body up like it was a piece of straw, and I carried it back to the kitchen. I dropped the body on the ground and watched as the automated droids began slicing him up and sticking the pieces in the oven.  


&#x200B;

I prayed and hoped with hope against hope that Mr. Porkman would not make me leave the restaurant. In all honesty, I found myself wishing I was dead. But soon I heard him, heard his voice talking to me and I felt his meaty arms wrapped around mine. I do not remember what he said, but the words damaged my mental defenses against him. I don't want to think about this anymore. I don't want to write about this anymore. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Please don't worry. Mr. Porkman did not leave the restaurant that day.  


&#x200B;

Eventually, Mr. Porkman exited my body. I could feel him move back into the meat. I left the restaurant.  Eventually, I would succeed in rescuing my younger sister and brother (two people much better than me) from the ICE fascists, and we are now trying to rescue our parents. I tried to forget the restaurant or to pray it away.  Only now can I reveal what happened that terrible, hungry night.  
I remember that night looking out the window before leaving and seeing Raven climb out of the cop car and escape into the night – her Victorian dress flying around her.  


&#x200B;

Raven if you're reading this, I have only one thing to say to you.  


&#x200B;

I'm sorry.
