10:28: we left the school this morning at 6:30, we are suppose to drive to a town that about 50 minutes drive from our city but after 25 minutes we were in traffic. why there is traffic so early in the morning? i don’t know. we are still in traffic and something fell weird so i came to here, I’ll update if something happens.

11:48: we are still in traffic and it doesn’t look like we are moving soon. i tried texting my mom to let her know we didn’t arrived but the message isn’t going through, I’ll try again later again.

12:13: I’m not the only one that can’t seem to text to my parents, other kids complain that their phone isn’t working.

13:28: we are still in traffic. some kids start to have panic attacks and some just laughing, my teacher Ms. Louise, tried calling the school many times but nobody answered. I’m starting to think that something bad is going to happen.

14:34: the town doesn’t exist. Brian, a boy from my class tried looking up the town name and nothing came out of it. i didn’t believed him but then i tried looking up for that and there is nothing. fucking nothing. where the hell are we going? Ms. Louise said that she is trying to find out what going on and that probably that just misunderstanding but i don’t believe that. I’ll update later if we found something.

15:56: we left traffic finally.

16:25: nothing is working. before just to some kids texts and phone calls didn’t work, but now everything doesn’t work for everyone. we are right now just keep going and hopefully we would find some place to stay and find help.

16:53: i just noticed that there isn’t other vehicles on the road and i don’t think I’m not the only one. some girls and boys from my class started to scream at Ms. Louise that they want to go home. i hope we are going home soon.

17:34: i have no internet but for some reason i can write here. we are still on the road and we are starting to be hungry, until now we ate snacks and drank some water that luckily we were allowed to take on the bus, but now we ran out of that either. i hope we are going to get out of here soon.

18:47: we are still doesn’t stopping. someone asked why we don’t talk to the driver, well because there isn’t one. yup, i don’t know when or how we didn’t noticed before but half hour ago Ms. Louise noticed that the man that was supposed to drive us is not there. she swears that she saw him and talked to him but now he is gone. i think she is losing her mind.

19:29: we are hungry, tired, and need to go to the toilet. at the moment we pee in empty bottles. it’s disgusting but that’s what we have for now. as to the bus it’s still didn’t stop. even without a driver it’s still going and there’s is still no car on the road. if this isn’t a cruel prank then i think we’re losing our fucking minds.

19:54: “do you think they are looking for us?” Amanda a girl from my class asked. we all said that yes ofc they are, but deep down we don’t think. as far everything that happened they think we made there or that actually we did made it, just not the real us, because by this point i wouldn’t be surprised if someone replaces us.

20:35: we saw another car. we banged on the window and screamed for their attention but nothing. no one pulled over or stopped. and soon enough they took off. but now we have some hope that in some time someone will notice us.

22:17: i went to sleep at around 9 and woke up 20 minutes ago to the sound of screaming. Miguel and Ross two boys from my class fight. this two idiots always had some rivalry but now of all times they took it out. the scream came from Alice another girl from my class who they accidentally hit in the face. Alice now have a black eye and crying in pain. that still didn’t stoped them so other boys separated them. we got to get out of here or we’re going to kill each other.

23:16: Alice lost it. she tried to break the window, ofc that didn’t work and she is now screaming in pain. she probably broke her hand or something. i can’t hear her screams anymore. and that birch Ms. Louise just sitting on the side and doing nothing.

00:34: finally there is silence. everyone is a sleep or tired. i think I’m going back to sleep and hopefully who’d wake up and this all be a dream.

02:57: i just woke up and the bus isn’t moving anymore. we are standing in place. i don’t know if i should wake up someone or to try to escape from this hell. i can’t risk that chance. 

03:23: i wake up Ms. Louise and told her what’s happening. she told me she would try open the door and to stay quiet. she is now trying to open the door.

03:27: she did it. she opened the doors. we are free.

03:32: we left. only me and Ms. Louise, we can’t risk that those idiots would ruin something. we are going to find some town or a any place with people and come back to help them.

08:45: sorry i didn’t update you all but a lot happened in the last 5 hours. after we left we walked for an hour until we found some town and went to there and knocked on some doors until someone opened their door. we called the police and they came after 10 minutes, they took us to questionings and they called my parents and Ms. Louise husband, at the meanwhile they started to look for the bus but still didn’t found anything. my parents would be here soon so I’ll update you then.

13:36: so i have new information to you. there was never a trip. yup. we got an email from the school the night before about this trip but apparently they didn’t send that. the police are working right now on finding the sender of the email. also they still didn’t found the bus, and honestly i don’t think they will. the parents did looked for us so that’s something at least. as for now that it, i don’t think that i can update about this in the future but I’ll try my best. the one thing i do know for sure is that this person or this thing wanted us dead. I’m just glad i got out of there before they found the body of the real Ms. Louise.
