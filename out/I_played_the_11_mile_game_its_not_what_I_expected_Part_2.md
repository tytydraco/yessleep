Running up to the old rotted wooden home, I can see the last of Gracie’s brown locks of hair as she enters and slams the door behind her. Rushing up the porch's decaying stairs, I grab the rusted doorknob and twist, pushing the door as I do. The door doesn’t budge. 

“Gracie, open the door!” I yell, voice filled with panic and slight aggression. 

Turning my head, I can see the humanoid shadows breaching the tree line on the far side of the road, making their way towards me. Turning my head back around, I pound my fist on the door, begging and pleading for it to open. I take 3 steps back and I ram my shoulder into the door, for how old the door is it doesn’t budge an inch. 

“Oh, come on, please! They’re getting closer.” I yell out, taking more steps back this time. 

Reaching the edge of the porch, I rush forward, slamming into the door for a second time, and it bursts open, and I fall through the threshold of the old doorway. I throw my arms out to brace my impact, but instead, when I land, it’s soft, well, not entirely. It wasn’t like I fell on a mattress; it was poky and crumbly. I look down and grab whatever broke my fall, picking up the pieces of green paper. Is it money? 

I bring myself to my feet and look around the room. It’s not a rundown house like I was expecting; it’s a good-sized room, maybe a 10x12. The walls are painted a creamy color, there’s a ceiling fan above me with a singular light bulb, and there are no pictures on the wall. 

The room is filled with money, all $100 bills, thousands of them. Looking around the room, there’s a brown wooden door on the opposite side. I look behind me at the door that I just came through, I definitely don’t want to go back out there. I make my way to the other door in the room, having to raise my knees to walk, almost like I’m treading through shallow water. 

Coming up to the door, I open it, and I step through to see a living room. In front of me is a grey couch facing a large TV that hangs mounted on the wall above a wooden electric fireplace. In contrast to the money room, this room has pictures on the dark blue walls. I step closer to get a good look. In every picture is a boy, about my age, with blonde hair and green eyes. The other person in the photo is a woman, elderly, probably the boy’s grandmother. 

There’s a little sofa chair in the corner of the room, matching the same light grey color as the couch. In the chair sits a woman, the very woman from the pictures. I quickly walk up to her, coming around the couch to get a better look. I stumble on something right next to the couch, quickly catching myself, and I look down. 

“What the fuck!” I exclaim, horror evident in my voice. 

Lying dead on the floor in front of the couch is the boy from the pictures; he clearly hasn’t been dead long. Finally, the woman notices my presence, looking up at me, her face has some emotion on it that I can’t quite read, it’s almost like she’s not surprised that I’m standing in her living room. 

“Hey, what happened to him?” I question, my voice coming out panicked. 

“He made the wish, he paid the price.” She muttered out, her voice hoarse from not speaking for a while. 

“W-what does that mean?” I stutter out, not quite knowing what to say. 

“He made the wish, he paid the price.” She repeated the same tone of voice and all. 

It was odd; she kept only repeating those words like she didn’t know any others. I tried asking where I was, or what was happening, but I only got the same 8-word response. Figuring this wasn’t going to help me, I saw another door just to the left of the TV. Walking over to it, I turned the handle, opened it, and entered. 

Walking into the next room was horrifying. I let out a shrill scream. The room was almost like the first, just plain grey walls, a door on the opposite side of the room. Except this one had a body in it, not a regular body either, it was a middle-aged man, his hair was brown and gray. What made me scream was his face, his eyes were squinting, not quite closed, his mouth was stitched into a wide smile. 

I walked closer, step by step, then his eyes darted towards me, his mouth made mumbling and moaning sounds. He was trying to get up I bolted, running to the next door, I opened it and burst through it, closing it just in time. Bracing for him to impact the door, I put my hands and body up against it, but it never came. 

“I’ve been waiting for you”. Said a voice I knew all too well.

I turned my head around, and there she was, Gracie was standing in a kitchen, it was beautiful, modern, but rustic. She was standing next to the giant island in the middle. She was as gorgeous as ever; she had changed clothes, no longer wearing the band tee that she loved so much. It was instead replaced by a plain white sweater, baggy jeans for the bottom. 

“Gracie! Thank god, we have to go.” I exclaimed while walking up to her and grabbing her hand. 

“Go? I don’t want to leave.” She replied sternly. 

“Gracie, hun, we have to leave this place. We can’t stay here.” I said softly, walking past her to the door, pulling her arm with me as I went. 

“No! I don’t want to leave! I’m staying here, I want you to stay too.” 

Hearing her say those words, I knew it was useless trying to get her to leave. She kept pulling me back by my arm, and I did the only thing I could think of; I ripped my arm from her hold and rushed through the door. I could hear her cries and pleas until I shut the door. Resting my forehead on the blue door, I cried. 

I cried for leaving her, and I cried in anger for this damn place doing this to us. Turning around to see what godforsaken room I was in now, it was a library. Bookshelves lined the walls of the room, and a small desk sat in the middle. A journal was open in the middle of the desk, and a pen sat next to the book. 

I slowly walked over and sat in the comfortable chair that was in front of the desk. I leaned down to read the journal. The words were pretty jumbled, I couldn’t make them out. Flipping to the first pages, I read what was on the page, I couldn’t believe it, whoever wrote this was trapped here just like me. The words read something like this. 

“I’ve been stuck in here for 3 days now, passing through different rooms, it seems to be wishes people had made that went wrong.” 

I flipped a couple more pages, taking the words into account; the money room had to have been someone wishing for money. The living room, the boy wished for his grandma to be alive, he didn’t know when he wished it, but his own life would be taken. The smile room, he wished for eternal happiness. Gracie’s room, she wished for us to stay there. 

I took about an hour to read through the journal; it told me everything the writer had tried to escape this place, breaking through the walls, ceiling, and floor; talking to the people didn’t work. It had everything but a damn way out of this place. On the last page was a sentence, just one, it read. 

“If you play, you stay.” 

The next four pages were ripped out of the journal. I searched the library for anything else that could help me, but I didn’t find anything. Sitting back in the chair, I started to think. There are four pages ripped out, and I’ve been through five rooms so far. 

“Holy shit! Maybe the pages are in the rooms.” I exclaimed aloud. 

The feeling of hope came to me for a split second before reality set in. I was still stuck, I don’t know if the missing pages are even in the rooms, and I have no idea if they will help me. Sending a quick thanks to whoever wrote this journal, I quickly stood up and made my way to the door. 

“Okay, I can do this. I can do this.” I kept repeating to myself, praying things would go okay. 

Taking one last look at the room I was in, I reached for the door handle, turned it, and pushed open the door. Stepping into the smile room, I cursed whoever made these rooms random. The man was sitting again, like when I first came through here. I slowly stepped towards him, he hadn’t noticed me yet. I looked around the room, and there was no paper; it had to be on him somewhere. 

“Great,” I muttered just loud enough for me to hear. 

Stepping closer, I could see it, the paper was in the man’s pocket, peeking out, tempting me. I took another carefully slow step towards the man, praying he was asleep. He wasn’t. He looked up at me. This time, he didn’t run at me; he looked defeated. I took another step, and now I was right above him. He looked up at me, moaning and groaning. 

“Are you trying to tell me something?” I questioned the man wearily. 

He rapidly shook his head up and down, pointing to his mouth. I realized what he was getting at. I reached a tentative hand up to the side of his mouth and pulled the stitch out. I slowly did the same to the other side. His face was scrunched in pain as I did this. Once the stitches were removed, his lips, bleeding and stretched, drooped on his face. Attempting to talk, he winced once more. 

“Thank you,” he said softly, words coming out slurred, and he had a lisp. 

“You’re welcome. Can you help me? I’m trying to get out of here.” I questioned him, almost begging him to help me. 

“Thank you,” he repeated, in the same soft tone he used before. 

“Oh fucking great! You repeat too.” I exclaimed angrily, my hands coming to hit my legs. 

He looked upset, like he wanted to say more but couldn’t. I looked at him, now that his mouth wasn’t sewn, he looked much sadder. At that moment, I could tell that making this wish was his biggest regret. 

“I’m sorry, but I really need that paper,” I said it more softly this time, hoping he could give it to me.

He reached into his pocket, grabbed the paper, and then handed it to me. He then said something that made me question whether these papers would really help me. 

“Thank you,” he said again, but this time he looked so relieved that I was taking this paper from him. 

I shot back a “you’re welcome,” and I opened the paper to see what it said. 

“Not of the game” 

What the fuck, why was I looking for these papers if they didn’t help me? Frustrated, I looked back at the man, and then to the door. Walking up to it, I ripped it open and stepped through. I was in the money room. This was going to take absolutely forever to dig through to find a tacky piece of paper that’s not helping me. 

Stepping through, I noticed something I didn’t notice before, resting up in the left corner, I could see a head peeking through the money. I ran over to see a woman, maybe mid-30s to 40s, and I pushed the money back from her face. Great, she was dead. I huffed in frustration, turning around, I started digging through the money. It took absolutely forever, but I finally found it; it was hidden in a little hole in the very corner of the room, behind the woman’s body. Opening it up, I read what this one said. 

“If you wish to leave.” 

What the hell does that mean? It doesn’t matter I just need to get the hell out of here. Walking to the door, all I can think of is Gracie. How am I going to convince her to leave? She’s not willing to leave this horrible fantasy, but I can’t just leave her, can I? Pushing the thought back, I open the next door. 

Walking into the living room, I start looking around, not even acknowledging the granny in here. Digging through the drawers, taking the cushions off the couch, looking under the couch, behind the TV, I couldn’t find it, I even searched the boy's body. 

“Where could it be?” I sigh out, hope diminishing as time passes on. 

Hearing a mumble, I turn my head to look at the other occupant in the room, her head tilted at me, looking at me expectantly. She slowly turns her head up and nods. Looking up, I can see something I didn’t notice before, tape on the underside of the ceiling fan blade. I quickly stand up, placing my feet on the couch, reaching my hand up to feel the top of the blade. I feel it, the paper. 

“Finally,” I mumble out, grabbing the paper. 

I quickly get down and open the paper, but the words written on it still don’t make much sense. I read and reread them multiple times. 

“You must lose all memory.” 

The words read out, loose memory of what? I don’t take much time to think about it before I’m headed to the door to the next room. I hesitate; the last room is the hardest, Gracie’s. I don’t know how this will go. Will she give me the paper like the others? Will she scream? Cry? I don’t know if I could handle that. Mustering up the courage, I open the door and step through. 

Stepping into the room I can’t see Gracie, but the room is bigger now. To my left is an opening to a huge living room; farther back, I can see a hallway with more doors in it. I’m not in those freaky wish rooms anymore. I’m in the house, Gracie wished up, seeing as she’s not in here anymore. I search the kitchen for the note. Digging through the drawers, the pristine white cabinets, even the microwave and trash can, it’s not here. 

“Fuck” I breathe out, frustration evident in my voice. 

“You won’t find it in there.” 

Turning my head, I already know who said it, i freeze as I make eye contact with her; it’s not just her, though. She’s holding a replica of my cat, and at her feet is her family dog. She looks happy, happier than I’ve ever seen her. Maybe this place is truly meant for her. Hell, maybe she can make a copy of me. 

“I’m not going to make a copy of you.” She speaks out once more. 

Maybe I said that out loud, or maybe she knew what I was thinking; she always does. 

“Where’s the paper, Gracie?” 

She doesn’t look shocked, she doesn’t even bat an eye at my questioning, she doesn’t scream or cry like I thought, she’s calm. I don’t know whether to run or cry. 

“Please, Gracie I can’t stay here. Just please give me the paper.” 

She’s trying to hide it, but I can see how much my words are affecting her. I take a couple of steps forward and grab the nachos out of her hands, putting him down. I grab her hands. Looking into her eyes, I whisper. 

“Please” 

It was a plea for her to free me, to let me leave this place. She grabs my hands and tries to lead me into the living room, but I stop her, I can’t go in there; something in me is telling me that if I cross that threshold, I’m stuck here. 

“I don’t want you to go.” She finally speaks out, bottom lip quivering. 

I do the only thing I can think of at that, I kiss her, it was slow and sweet, wrapping my arms around her, sitting in her back pocket is the paper. I grab it just as I pull back, and I look into her eyes; she’s smiling widely now, hope evident on her face. I turn away, not willing to face her disappointment, walking to the door, and she lets me. I can hear her faint cries just as I step through the door, leaving her in fantasy. 

Back in the library, I sit at the desk, with all the papers in front of me, and I try to find what order they need to be in. I swear it takes me another 30 minutes just trying to figure the jumble of sentences out. I slam my hands on the desk as I jump up, it can’t be this right. I could never do that; it must be wrong. 

“If you play, you must stay. If you wish to leave, you must erase all memory. Not of the game, but of the one whom with you came.”

I speak it out like a curse in a fairytale, not quite believing what I’m reading, I’ll have to forget about Gracie. 

If you’ve played the 11 mile game did you come across this house, are you missing memories of someone? I don’t know what forgetting Gracie will mean and I’m not sure if I want to know. If you have played or haven’t please comment about what the next 5 miles is going to look like for me, I’ve lost the paper with the rules so I have no clue. I will update you guys when I can, thank you for all your help. 

I’ve been sitting in the chair for another hour, and I know what I have to do. I stand up and walk to the beautiful redwood door that appeared in the room. I take slow steps towards it, tears streaming down my face. I open the door, a black abyss in front of me, I stepped through, everything went quiet, and I don’t remember who I was calling for anymore.
