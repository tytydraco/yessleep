My phone is running out of battery, so I better make this quick. It all started a couple of days ago, when my niece brought over a pet rabbit she'd found in a nearby forest, but something was... off. It seemed like it was starving (ribcage bones showing, drooling when seeing greenery), but it refused to eat. I snapped a quick selfie, and decided to go to the vet. 

"Well, everything seems normal here... There *are* some dark spots in the mouth, but they might just be rot. I'll see what I can do," the vet droned on and on and on... I couldn't help but begin scrolling on Shorts, watching video after video on how to make hundreds of thousands of dollars on posting AI slop and Family Guy clips. I love PHONK.

"SHUT THE FUCK UP!", I thought to myself. "When is this bitch gonna stop yapping?! I hate this stupid fucking bunny, I wish it'd burn in hell! God, I fucking hate animals! I'm going to be a fucking carnivore now out of spite! I - " My internal monologue was interrupted by the vet injecting saline directly into my muscles by accident.

 "OW, FUCK!!", I yelped in surprise as the pain coursed through my weak, skinny little mummy-like body. My overgrown fingernails gripped his forearm, nearly drawing blood. I curled up on the floor, writhing in agony. "IT BURNS!! OHH MY FUCKING GOD!! AAAAHH!!!" After the surgery, I saw something in that vet.

My God. Those beautiful, shrunken in amber eyes. Those succulent fingers. Her shiny, delicious little elbows. I'm going fucking insane. Oh, my God. She's so... beautiful... I hadn't even noticed that I'd touched the rabbit's delicious molars earlier (when appreciating her delectable physique).



After a couple of weeks, we started dating. My dirty fingernails dug into her pale, flaking skin as I walked in a nearby national park. Suddenly, I felt a sharp, rising pain in my teeth. "Owie! Ow! My beautiful, yellow, rotting teeth! MAKE IT STOP!! PLEASE!!" "I love you too, baby...", she grinned, oblivious to my sheer fucking agony. I'm dying. Oh my God new "PLEASE! THIS IS SERIOUFF!! FFFKCKCKC!!!" I started to suffocate as the tusk-like protrusions hit my upper jaw and began to penetrate it completely. They just kept growing and getting sharper and sharper, making my entire body gush blood violently (even my hair). "CKFKCKCFFKKCCK!@!! MMFKCKC!!" 

"Oh, yeah! I never even learned your name!" "CMMCMFFFF!! CKCKCCKFFF!!!" "What a weird fucking name that is. God, I hate you so much, actually! I never even realized the true hatred I've always felt for you. Every cell in my being has always hated you. Hatred. HATRED. HATRED! HATRED!!!!!", she lunged at my soon-to-be-dead body, kicking the absolute shit out of it with her stinky, wet little loafers. She smells so bad. I'm sorry. She's so fucking stinky. Her vile stench distracted me so much from my pain, that I managed to use my yellow, twig-like legs to stand up and walk my ass over to the nearest hospital, 

where I am now slowly suffocating to death and leaking near-transparent puss. Someone help me. Oh and the name is Shauexn, Shauexn Hope, but people just call me Shope!
