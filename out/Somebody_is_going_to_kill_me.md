It’s 9:31 pm right now. 

I am trying somehow to figure out how to write this. I had a friend who invited me down for dinner at her house, by a lake. I liked her. I wanted to know her more. I am shy and I felt she liked me. So I wanted to hang out. I just… I really just wanted to hang out.

I came there around 5 pm. Her family was there, and they were smiling. It took me one second to notice the goat skull and the upside down pentagram. And… yeah.

I looked at my friend, and she was nervous. So were her folks. And rightfully so. Obviously every thought ran through my head. 

You know I can’t write this crap. I just don’t know how I got into this. I am just crying as I type. I feel wrong.

The folks were nice. Believe it or not, they are not villains, at least I think. I don’t know much. What I do know is that her dad was a businessman, and sometime ago he started worshipping a demon. Because by his own admission he was an idiot. But now they have to stick with their stain. The whole family. But, my friend, she had a chance to escape. Turns out if she finds someone like me, she could escape.

They aren’t bad people as I said. Or at least they aren’t anymore. But they can’t run. Their son has to keep carrying this weight. He was only thirteen. But my friend, she can escape with me, or someone. It’s just that she really liked me.

I don’t know what to say. I am rambling. They were desperate. They needed a chance. I wish I would have spoken up earlier. Maybe I could have saved them, if I had just spoken up earlier. I really liked her. I didn’t want her to die. But she did.

I am so broken. It was two hours in, and then the lights went out. And I fell asleep. And then I woke up, and they were dead. They looked slightly blue. None of them were breathing. They had just died. I scrambled and quickly called 911. And as I did I began to cry. I became too much. And then I saw a note and told the operator. It said “They are going to kill me.”

I don’t know what to do now. A cop, who tired to speak to me while I had my thousand yard stare, thinks it might have been a suicide cult, and they needed to die and screw me over. I told him I don’t buy it. He said it’s not that hard. We may never find something. They have a lake. They will search it. But if they wanted to do this, they could do it. Or someone helped them out.

At that moment he stopped talking. He saw my eyes. He realized he screwed up.

I am so confused. All I know is somebody is going to kill me, and I don't wanna die.
