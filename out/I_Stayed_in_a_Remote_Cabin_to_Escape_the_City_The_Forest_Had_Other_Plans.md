When my friend warned me about the forest, I laughed it off. Now, I can’t stop hearing the howl. I know it’s still out there, waiting for me.

I never planned to stay in the cabin for long. It was supposed to be a retreat—a place to quiet my thoughts, far from the city’s suffocating noise. When my friend Chris offered me his family’s old cabin up north, he called it “rustic.” That was generous. The place was a relic, sagging under the weight of neglect, surrounded by a forest so dense it seemed alive. Solitude was the point. Forgetting was the goal.

The drive up was a blur of empty roads and wilderness, the kind that makes you feel untethered from reality. By the time I arrived, the sun was sinking behind the trees, casting shadows that stretched like skeletal fingers over the clearing. The cabin loomed there, stubborn and solitary, like it had been waiting for me.

Chris had mentioned the forest with a half-smile two weeks earlier. “Some people say weird stuff happens out there,” he’d said, swirling his beer. “Just don’t let it get to you.”

I’d laughed it off, even teased him. But now, standing in the shadow of that oppressive tree line, his words replayed in my mind like a quiet warning.

As I unpacked, the first cries of the forest rose in the air—sharp, shrill, and inhuman. My skin prickled, but I forced a laugh. “Just an owl,” I muttered, though my voice didn’t quite sound like my own.

Inside, the cabin smelled like decay and disuse. The generator coughed to life, throwing weak light into the gloom. I grabbed a book, determined to distract myself, but the sounds of the forest kept breaking through, a symphony of distant rustling and faint echoes. It wasn’t until the scratching started that I put the book down for good.

It was subtle at first, a faint scrape against the back wall. My fingers froze on the page as I strained to hear. Another scrape, slow and deliberate, like someone testing the wood.

“Chris?” I called, my voice wavering.

I knew it wasn’t him. Chris wouldn’t drive hours into the wilderness to prank me. But the alternative—that something else was out there—was a thought I wasn’t ready to entertain.

I grabbed the flashlight and opened the back door, the beam trembling as it cut through the darkness. Nothing. Just swaying grass and shadows that seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking. I forced the door shut, locking it with a shaky hand.

“It’s just an animal,” I whispered, trying to steady my breathing. But deep down, I felt it—that itch in the back of my mind, the primal knowledge that I wasn’t alone.

The sound didn’t stop.

Through the night, it continued: soft crunches of leaves, faint creaks of the cabin, and—once—a sound so close and deliberate it could only have been breathing. I told myself to sleep, but each time I closed my eyes, my body jolted awake, my nerves screaming at me to stay alert.

When morning finally came, I stepped outside to investigate. The sight froze me in place. Tracks, clawed and impossibly large, circled the cabin in uneven loops. They weren’t like anything I’d seen before, and their size suggested something… wrong.

The day passed in a haze, my mind trapped in an endless loop of questions. What had made those tracks? Why was it circling the cabin? I busied myself with menial tasks—splitting wood, scrubbing the kitchen counter—but my gaze kept drifting to the tree line. The forest seemed to press closer, its shadows darker and more tangled.

I locked every door and window as night fell. The noises started earlier this time—scratching, followed by the low rumble of something alive. Not just alive, but aware.

The sound wasn’t random. It moved. Circled. Tested.

I clutched the flashlight, my knuckles white against the cold metal. Then came the howl—a deep, mournful wail that carried through the trees. It wasn’t a wolf. It wasn’t anything I could name. The sound crawled under my skin, stirring something primal and ancient.

I wanted to believe I was imagining it, but the fear was too real. My mind spiraled: What if it gets in? What if I can’t stop it? What if it already knows how this ends?

Sleep was out of the question. I spent the night staring at the door, flinching at every noise.

By the third day, I was unraveling. Every shadow felt like a threat, every gust of wind a whisper of something hunting me. The solitude that once felt freeing now felt like a trap.

As dusk fell, I set up crude traps around the cabin—pots, pans, anything to give me warning. It was ridiculous, childish even, but it was all I could do.

I was adjusting one of the traps when I saw it. A shape moved in the trees, just beyond the reach of my flashlight. My breath hitched. The beam wavered, catching the glint of something watching me. Eyes. Amber and glowing, brimming with a terrible intelligence.

The light flickered, and the figure melted into the darkness. My heart raced as I stumbled backward, the weight of its gaze lingering long after it was gone.

That night, the cabin was a prison. I sat by the fire, shotgun across my lap, jumping at every creak and groan. The howling returned, closer now. Then the scraping began again—this time against the front door.

I rose shakily, the shotgun trembling in my hands. “Leave!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

The scraping stopped. For a moment, I thought it was over. Then came the growl—a deep, guttural sound that shook the air. My chest tightened as I aimed at the door.

The silence that followed was unbearable, every second stretching into eternity. Then the windows shattered.

Glass exploded inward as something massive lunged through—a grotesque hybrid of man and beast, its fur bristling, its eyes burning with malevolent glee.

I didn’t think. I didn’t plan. As the creature lunged, instincts buried in ancient parts of my brain took over. My first shot barely slowed it, but the deafening roar of the shotgun gave me a few precious seconds to move. I bolted through the back door, slamming it behind me as I stumbled into the forest.

The night swallowed me whole. The trees pressed in, their branches clawing at my skin as I ran blindly through the undergrowth. My breaths came in shallow gasps, the cold air biting at my lungs. Somewhere behind me, the creature howled—a sound that reverberated through the darkness, rattling my bones. It was playing with me. I could feel it.

The forest was a maze, every shadow a potential threat, every sound a harbinger of death. I tripped and fell, the earth rising to meet me in a brutal embrace. Pain shot through my knees and hands, but I scrambled to my feet, terrified of what might catch me if I stayed down.

I felt its presence more than saw it—a shadow that moved too fast, too deliberately. My flashlight flickered, its beam catching a brief flash of fur and those terrible eyes. I wanted to scream, but my voice was locked behind a wall of sheer panic.

It could have caught me. I knew that. It was faster, stronger, more capable in every way. But it didn’t. It wanted me to keep running. Why? Why didn’t it end this? What did it want? The questions spiraled, my mind grasping at answers even as my body screamed for rest.

By dawn, I was completely lost. The forest stretched endlessly, a labyrinth of gnarled roots and towering trees. Every direction looked the same, the light barely penetrating the dense canopy above. My legs trembled with exhaustion, my throat raw from gasping for air.

Exhaustion clouded my mind leaving only fear, but one thought stood out above the chaos: It’s not over. It’s never going to be over.

That’s when I stumbled into the clearing.

It was unlike anything I’d seen before, a stark contrast to the suffocating forest around it. The ground was bare and scorched, the air heavy with the scent of ash and decay. At the center stood a stone altar, its surface carved with strange symbols that seemed to shift under my gaze. The sun cast harsh shadows over the bones scattered around it—human bones, picked clean and gleaming white.

My stomach churned, the sight almost too much to bear. This wasn’t just an animal. This was something older, something far beyond my comprehension. This was its domain. I was trespassing in a place I didn’t belong, and I realized then that I’d been led here.

A growl rumbled behind me, low and deliberate. I froze, every nerve screaming in warning as I turned. The dogman stood at the edge of the clearing, its hulking form illuminated in the morning light. It was larger than before, its muscles rippling beneath its dark fur. Those glowing eyes locked onto mine, and I saw it—recognition. It wasn’t just hunting me. It was toying with me.

This wasn’t an animal. It was a predator, intelligent and malevolent. It was in control, and I was just the game.

My fingers tightened around the shotgun, the only barrier between me and certain death. The creature’s growl deepened as it stepped forward, its lips pulling back to reveal rows of razor-sharp teeth.

This was it. The end. No one would ever know what happened to me, why I vanished without a trace.

“Stay back!” I shouted, my voice cracking under the weight of my fear. The dogman didn’t stop. It moved slowly, deliberately, savoring every step as it closed the distance.

I fired, the blast echoing through the clearing. The creature flinched but didn’t fall. Blood matted its fur, but its movements were unbothered, as though pain meant nothing to it.

Desperation surged through me. My body acted on autopilot, grabbing a jagged bone from the ground and swinging it wildly as the shotgun fell from my grasp. The bone caught it across the muzzle, and it let out a guttural snarl—more annoyance than pain. But it was enough.

I ran.

The forest blurred around me, my legs screaming in protest as I forced them to move. Every second felt stolen, every step closer to freedom—or death. I could hear it behind me, crashing through the undergrowth, its growls reverberating through the trees.

I burst from the forest and stumbled back toward the cabin, slamming the door behind me and collapsing against it. My chest heaved, my hands trembling so violently I could barely think.

The growling started again, louder this time, reverberating through the walls. It was everywhere. Surrounding me. I pressed my hands to my ears, trying to block it out, but it seeped into my mind, into my very bones.

The first rays of sunlight crept through the trees, washing the forest in an eerie golden light. The growling stopped. The silence that followed was worse, heavy and oppressive, broken only by the sound of my ragged breathing.

I didn’t hesitate. I grabbed the car keys from the table, every muscle in my body screaming in protest as I stumbled outside. The woods were deathly quiet, as if the creature had never been there at all.

I sped down the gravel road, the cabin shrinking in my rearview mirror. My mind raced, the memories replaying like a horror film I couldn’t escape. The howls, the glowing eyes, the altar. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I hadn’t escaped—that it had let me go.

By the time I reached the gas station, I was trembling so badly I could barely keep my grip on the steering wheel. I broke down the moment I stepped out of the car, tears streaming down my face as the reality of what had happened crashed over me.

The police didn’t believe me. They found nothing at the cabin—no tracks, no broken windows, no altar in the woods. Just a rotting structure with nothing out of place.

But I know what I saw. I know what followed me.

And sometimes, in the dead of night, when the wind is just right, I still hear it—a howl, long and mournful, calling out from the distance.

And I know it’s not finished with me.
