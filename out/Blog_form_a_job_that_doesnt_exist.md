Has anyone ever had a crush on someone at work and just... completely lost the ability to function like a normal human being?

Like, you’re sitting three pods away trying to recalibrate a Type-4 tranquiliser rig, and suddenly the weekly “Safety Briefing” feels like the Met Gala.  
Her name’s Iris. I swear I’ve never seen anyone quite like her. Natural blonde hair that moves like it’s perpetually caught in cinematic slow motion. The kind of smile that feels like someone turned the oxygen levels up just for you.  
Wait—sorry. I’m getting ahead of myself.

Bit of background.

I just got back from a field rotation up in Scotland. Short-term containment op near Loch Lomond. The Loch Ness site’s been quiet for decades, Brexit the UK has become a little more lax on its supply of local mutton.

Turns out she’d ditched Loch Ness entirely and had been showing up all over Scotland. Can’t blame him honestly, or her wait, why am I scared of misgendering a dinosaur? We only tracked her down because she photobombed a kid’s Instagram post He was chucking a traffic cone on the top of the Rob Roy statue in Loch Lomond. Side note that is genuinely a thing Scottish people do. I think one in Glasgow had like 7 traffic cones piled on its head at once, truly remarkable. Gotta love Scotland, almost makes me want to be Scottish.

Anyway, containment was mostly routine.

Emphasis on mostly.

 

Until one of Ragnar Squad’s brightest minds—an American, obviously—decided he was destined to be a monster-slaying folk hero.

The guy (Derek. Of course his name was Derek) grabs a harpoon, yells “You should’ve known when to go extinct!” and launches it at a 50-foot slab of prehistoric rage.

Now, whatever else you want to say about Nessie, girl has a serious gym routine. I’ve stuck with her—it feels more respectful.

 

And yeah, I can already hear you:

“But isn’t a harpoon a good thing? Like, they use them on whales.”

Sure. Theoretically, a harpoon could work.

But not when we brought an entire reinforced net, hydraulic winch, carbon-fibre rig specifically designed for this overgrown salamander.

Worst part? Nature’s magnum opus, right here decided to strap the harpoon to his harness.

Correction: my harness. The dumb bastard nicked it while I wasn’t looking. I’d left it on the loading crate, assuming he was using it to secure the crane rig. Silly me. Turns out Derek had other plans. The man tethered himself to a living fossil like he was at a rodeo.

Speaking of, I have questions for the first guy to ever try rodeo.

Actually, no—the second guy.

Because the first guy? Fine. Curiosity, stupidity, maybe a dare. I get it.

But the second guy?

That dude saw the first guy get launched into low orbit by a furious animal and still thought,

“Yeah, that seems like a sound recreational activity. Let me just climb on this bucking beast and see what happens.”

Anyway, sorry got sidetracked back to captain America. His final words were both heroic and completely stupid. “Should’ve known when to go extinct?” What does that even mean? Like, is extinction a choice now? Like dinosaurs fill out HR paperwork and hand in a notice?

Anyway, Nessie evidently took his words to heart. Whipped her tail once, and Derek got launched off the deck like a misfired bungee jumper. You know those videos where someone’s harness snaps mid-jump and they just... vanish? Could never be me, too scared of that man. But yeah, It was like that, except more pink mist and fewer GoPros.  
And just like that, Derek was extinct.

This pissed me off, since it was my harness I got volunteered by my squad captain to clean him up. Thanks, Captain Rex…    
Credit where credit’s due—Nessie made it quick. Efficient, even. The man was reduced to scattershot within minutes. Unfortunately, we have this little thing called *Protocol Zero*—no biological trace left behind. So before even having captured the beats, I started to figure out how the fuck I was going my clean up water  while fish nibbled what I *think* used to be Derek’s glutes.

Luckily, Sasha Squad managed to get her down. Took four tranquiliser rounds the size of fire extinguishers, three boats, and one brave soul using bagpipes as a distraction (I wish I was joking, dude was playing Scotland the brave as well). Not sure how they got her back into the loch we built her—thing’s a full-blown luxury resort. Temperature-controlled, zero current drift, even a waterfall for enrichment. She’s got a better life than me. Though to be fair, my last apartment had damp and a haunted kettle.

Anyway.

You know you're in a weird career when you're arguing with a seagull over a coworker’s pinky finger.

There I was, wrestling a gull mid-air while trying to keep what was left of Derek from entering the local food chain, when Ragnar strolled over and introduced me to the newest member of his squad.

Apparently, they’d recruited her from a nearby pub.  
Standards have *plummeted*.

Her name is Iris.

She reached out, shook my hand, and smiled. And in that moment, I forgot every single one of my emergency protocols. I forgot what year it was. I forgot about Derek’s scattered remains floating just behind her like alphabet soup made of poor decisions.  
She said, “Hi, I’m Iris.”  
And I swear time stopped.

I conceded to the Seagull who flew off laughing at me little bastard even looked back at me mid-flight, just to rub it in.

 I forgot every word in my vocabulary. Tried to respond, choked on air instead. Real smooth.

Luckily, Ragnar stepped in before I could fully crash and burn, clapping a hand on my shoulder and going, “Why don’t you walk her through the cleanup op?”

Love that man. If I wasn’t in Rex Squad, I’d have defected to Ragnar’s ages ago. No hesitation.

So, off we went. I took her through the cleanup process—bucket of what’s left of Derek in one hand, clipboard in the other. She was surprisingly sharp, picking up procedures quicker than half the guys I’ve worked with. Honestly made me wonder how someone like her ended up in a job like this. The poor girl deserved a lab coat and a latte, not a biohazard suit and a mop with PTSD.

She told me she grew up in Dunblane. Spoke about it with this softness—like the kind you usually reserve for places you miss, or people you loved who aren’t around anymore. There was just… something about the way she talked. I was under her spell. Honestly didn’t mind repeating instructions a dozen times if it meant I got to hear her ask one more question.

I think I smiled the whole time like an idiot.

I started imagining our life together. Quiet mornings. Matching security badges. Maybe raising a Class-C entity together if management ever reinstates the domestic hosting program.

I honestly think she likes me. Or at least, she liked me. Just as I was about to hand her back to her squad, that fucking seagull flew right overhead and shat out  what looked to be the rest of Derek right onto my head,  I guess seagulls don’t like American fast food.  Great mood killer. Thanks, Scotland.

Any way, I still need to hunt that Chub that made off with aorta? I think,  well his something at least.

Ill keep whoever is interested updated on how it goes with Iris…
