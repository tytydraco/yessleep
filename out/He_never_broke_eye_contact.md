I don't know what the hell to do anymore. I just don't. My life has been in shambles. What I have witnessed was so goddamn disturbing I don't think I will ever be the same again. I've been suffering from insomnia and paranoia ever since this happened. Read this at your discretion.

It all started on September 14th, 2024. I'm a 32 year old catholic man with a wife and kid. I grew up in the country and I honestly just wanted to get out of the city. I hated it. Work was stressing the hell out of me and I had a mean-ass gambling addiction. A couple bad cards and a few bad choices led me down a dark, dark path. After a few drinks at the bar to my mind, I went to the nearest ATM. I ended up withdrawing all of my money and fled the state in a desperate move to start anew. I had enough money to last around a week. I had an old business partner in the area willing to bail me out and get me a small place while I got my shit together. It wasn't much, just some old property he bought a while ago and used for storage. I could tell he hadn't stepped in the damn place for years but I had no options. I brought my wife and kid along with me of course. The kid was sobbing like never before. I think the realization that he would never see any of his friends again really hit him hard. She stayed with him at the place while I went off to check out the church. Something I wish I never did.

This town was so damn small you couldn't even really call it a town. We had no neighbors and something you could barely call a road. The nearest church was roughly 12 miles up the road. I parked my car on the side of the road and walked up to the church. I clearly must have been misinformed because there was no way any sermons were still held at this church. It had vines growing all over it and the entire thing was damn near falling apart. This was I first saw him. That fucker. My blood ran cold at the sight. I still don't know why, maybe god was warning me to take my family and get the hell away from this place. He had a black robe on. It blew in the wind like he was the goddamn grim reaper or something. His hood had weird markings on it but they weren't consistent and I have never seen them before. He had the most blank stare I had ever seen, like he rarely blinked. My heart was pounding. When he locked eyes with me, he never broke contact. Never. I just shrugged it off as he must be some drunk weirdo hanging around the church. Deep down, I knew something was horribly wrong with him. I decided I'd seen enough of the church and drove home. He. Never. Broke. Eye. Contact. I looked in the rearview mirror and he was watching me from afar.

I got home and told my wife about the "drunk weirdo" I saw at the church. She had a good laugh about it. That was the last time she ever laughed. We turned off the lights and I went over to shut the window. He was there. I was scared shitless. I screamed. I fell to the floor. When I got up, he wasn't there. My wife was frantically asking me if I was ok. I just told her it was my overactive imagination and we went to sleep.

All I had were nightmares. One of them I remember clear as day. My wife told me about how she loathed me and about how I never spend anytime with our son.

"YOU NEVER SPEND ANYTIME WITH YOUR SON. ALWAYS OFF DOING WHAT? DRINKING? GAMBLING?" she screamed.

"WITHOUT ME, YOU WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE THIS PLACE. WHAT THE HELL DOES IT MATTER WHAT I DO WITH MY FREE TIME?" I retaliated.

"THE ONLY REASON YOU EVEN HAVE THIS PLACE IS BECAUSE OF YOUR OLD SLEAZY BUSINESS PARTNER. DON'T YOU DARE TRY AND ACT LIKE YOU HAVE THIS FAMILY AT YOUR BEST INTEREST." she yelled back.

There he was. I was ready to scream back at her, but instead I screamed out of terror. That same damn blank stare. He stabbed her straight through the abdomen. He pulled out the knife and she fell to the floor. My stomach knotted. I couldn't talk, I couldn't scream, and I couldn't cry. It felt like my entire body was shaking. He attached the knife to his robe and just stared at me. The surroundings faded and went slowly black. It was just me and him, staring at each other at limbo. Those. Damn. Lifeless. Gray. Eyes.

I woke up. My wife was on the floor with an expression as blank as his. She was dead. The police determined she died from a stab wound and the time of death was around 4:06 AM. The knife was next to her and it was ruled a suicide. I felt a mix of pain and fear. I was outside sitting with my son as the police investigated. My son cried. He was only eight and had to deal with his mother's "suicide." I fucking knew better. I stood up.

"WHO THE HELL ARE YOU? WHY ME? WHY PUNISH ME GOD?" I screamed.

My heart was pounding. I felt like I was going to faint. I wanted to wake up so bad. This had to be a nightmare. As morning broke, all I could do was finally break down and cry alongside my son. After minutes of straight sobbing, I finally looked up. I saw him in the distance with that same blank stare. The knife was no longer holstered on his robe. I went to go and tell the police who were inside my house but I must've been crying for so long that they just left. Their cars were no longer in the driveway. I looked back and the bastard was still there. He. Never. Broke. Eye. Contact. I grab my son by the wrist and took him back inside. He was still screaming and crying.

I'm now in the house writing this and I don't know what the hell to do. I'm thinking of calling the police again but they may think me as some insane madman who can't get over the loss of his wife. Still so surreal writing that. I can't believe she's gone. I fucking can't. I'm seeing him out of the corner of my eye. I see his stare in my son's eyes. Every creak sounds like footsteps. I'm on the verge of breaking down.
