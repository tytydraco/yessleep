I didn’t know I was dreaming until I awoke. Face down. Sore. Like my entire body was inflamed. I lifted my head and my cheek peeled off the floor in a glue of coagulated blood. It came from my mouth. Just like I could see in my fingernails, I could feel blood lining the edge of my gums. It felt like every bone in me had shifted and every muscle had atrophied. And I felt great. Powerful, even.



A fire was lit in the stove, casting dancing shadows over the brick walls, briefly making me think I wasn’t alone. I was, though. This place was familiar. Somewhere I had been before but couldn’t place just when or why. But it made me angry. All of it. I didn’t know why, but the books and the tools and the beakers and chemicals, I hated it all. And that hate felt good. It felt exciting. I had no idea who I was, but it didn’t matter. I was here, now. As I lifted myself from the floor, shattered glass crackled under my weight. A glass had broken around me. Must’ve fallen when I had. Footsteps hurried towards a nearby closed door up a small staircase.



“Sir, are you alright? I heard a crash.”



The voice knocked, and I stifled a laugh. This man sounded weak and comfortable. And based on the size of this…laboratory…this man had been comfortable for a long time in somewhere grand and warm.



I felt my jacket and in the breast pocket was a key. My eyes drifted across the room and landed on a small metal door on its other side. The weak man knocked again, and I knew I had to escape. Whoever I had been, I wasn’t now. This was my night. My time. I needed to seize it. A cane leaned against the wall and I snagged it and ran. Threw open the door. Stepped out into the night.



A new feeling.



Mist enveloped me and I stopped. Closed my eyes. Whoever I had been before, I hated. He had kept me from this. I took my first steps into the world and the night buzzed. I glanced in every window I passed, checked to see if they were locked. They all were, of course, but maybe one wouldn’t be. And I could slide in silently and smell the food they ate and listen to the stories they told their children.



A slim row home stood at the end of the street, the lights all off inside. As I passed I saw my reflection. It startled me. I stepped closer to the glass, then closer again. I was hideous. My skin was pale and bruised and wrapped tightly around the bone underneath. I now saw the cause of the blood in my gums: my teeth were jetting out and twisted; sensitive to the touch. My eyes were yellowed and the bags underneath them drew my eyelids low. A thin layer of fuzzy hair covered my face, and the hair on my head was greasy and thick. The closest thing I could think to compare myself to was a dog. Or maybe, a monkey. Whoever my other half was, whether I came from him or him from me, this wasn’t how he looked. If it was, he would’ve been exiled long ago.



I left my reflection not sure how I felt. The face matched the soul, I suppose…but why did it feel so unfair? Muffled voices pierced through the window from its other side. Not hushed, so I don’t think they saw me. Still, I ran off. I wanted confrontation, but I wanted it on my terms. When I was ready. I peeled off from the main street into a slim alleyway and slowed down. I glanced over my shoulder to confirm I wasn’t being followed. I wasn’t. My head down and pace fast, I propelled myself with my adopted cane, a piercing echo shot with every impact on the cobblestone.



And then I heard the music.



Quiet at first, louder as I reached the alley’s end. I stopped at its outlet and stared across the street, at the glowing cathedral in front of me. Some sort of celebration was inside, and out from the open entrance the sounds of an organ poured. Silhouettes filled the windows and their chattering voices melded into one droll note. Even from this distance I could feel the warmth inside. I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to steal it and make it mine. It shouldn’t be there’s when it could belong to me. My mind raced as I plotted my entrance, announcing myself and directing the guests’ attention to me and to my grotesque ghoulish face.



I prepared to approach, but just before I took my first step from the safety of the shadows, a sweet choral voice asked, “Are you hiding?”



It sent a jolt through me. I spun to face the voice, but no one was there. Until I looked down. At knee-height a little girl looked up at me, leaned against the wall of the eastward building. I tried to speak, but my voice cracked. I cleared my throat and responded with only, “What?”



The girl didn’t falter. With the same confidence, she again asked, “Are you hiding?”



My shoulders shrugged. “I suppose.”



“Why?”



I smiled. “Because that’s what I do, I’m a hider. I hide.”



She looked at the cathedral and then down to her feet. “I’m hiding too.” She sighed. “There’s too many people in there. I don’t want to go back inside.”



The little girl was dressed formally, in a way that didn’t suit her – dressed by people older and without care for the girl’s wants. Tightly and uncomfortably. Those people made her anxious, but not me. She seemed happy to have a friend to share in her discomfort. I smiled widely at her, and I could feel my lips curl over my concave teeth. “That’s alright. You can do as you like.”



She looked back at the gathering and watched silently for a moment. “I should go back. Will you help me cross the street?” The girl turned to me and took my hand. Her touch sent a fire through my nerves, like an unbearable electricity. Unconsciously I flicked my hand away from her, accidentally striking her on the cheek. I froze and watched as her eyes filled with tears. She grabbed at her face and began to cry.



I had hated myself gleefully until this moment. Now I hated myself truly. And this feeling of hate I hated. And I knew this girl wasn’t the cause, but still, I hated her for it. And so I slapped her again. She screamed after I did, and I pushed her to the ground. My chest fluttered as a cackle rose from my gut and left me in a squealing mania. I stomped down on her and she curled into a ball, doing her best to protect herself from my blows. And I wanted to stop. And I wanted to help her. And my eyes welled and my laugh only grew louder, as did her screams. Loud enough to draw the attention of those at the cathedral.



The first few figures who poured down the cathedral’s front stairwell didn’t concern me. Even when they saw me, and they hesitated to run over. But then more and more followed, and a mob formed and approached quickly. They screamed as they did, calling on me to stop. To “get away.” I knew if they reached me that I’d be at the very least maimed, most likely killed. And the short window of life I had would already close. With a final kick I spun and sprinted down the alleyway, back towards where I came.



The girl’s whimpers faded with every step, but the ferocity of the crowd helping her only grew. A stampede of footsteps followed behind me, but I was quicker. From the alleyway I ran back towards the home I departed from, giggling from the rush of the moment. A few passersby stopped and watched me, but they did nothing to slow my efforts.



The back door of the house came into view and I dug out the key I had found in my jacket. As I reached the door, in one fell swoop I unlocked it and slid inside, barely changing my pace or gate. I threw my cane and locked the door behind me. I fell backwards, crawling away and whispering curses at the people who thought they could catch me.



For the athletic ease I had experienced all night, I had trouble catching my breath again. Maybe it was the adrenaline wearing off. But still, even my eyelids began to feel heavy.



At the interior door of the laboratory, that man began knocking again. Harder now. His soft hands were probably getting bruised, poor thing. “Sir, is that you?” He asked.



I was really having trouble keeping my eyes open now. The heat in my body felt like it was cooling. It was clear I was returning to nonexistence. I curled my fingers into the floor and flexed every muscle in my body, desperately trying to fight against the big sleep.



The man again rapped at the door. “Dr. Jekyll, are you alright?”



My mind quieted and I lied flat. My heartbeat slowed and a fantastic relaxing tingle spread from my spine outwards into every part of my body. Sound disappeared. Then touch.



And then it went black.
