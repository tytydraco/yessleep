&#x200B;

After some conversations with Dean and the others, they think I should try to get my mind on something else aside from Ludus. Therefore, I've decided to relay another one of my earlier experiences which may seem counterproductive I know, but at least it's a breath of fresh air compared to what I've been steeped in for over a year now. This particular experience took place a few months after we dealt with the vampires. Quick aside from that, there has been some progress with Chaviva. While a cure still hasn't been developed, they have managed to help her with behavior therapy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She's able to resist the urge to bite someone's throat long enough to hold a conversation. Her family is even able to talk with her occasionally. The same can't be said of the vampire that bit her. Anyway, it was my first day back in school and for me, it was in a new school. As I mentioned in my first post, Dean's line of work required us to move frequently.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Usually, we didn't stay anywhere longer than a year, sometimes, not even six months. While I wouldn't call this an ideal environment for social growth, I did manage to make some friends and keep them in my contacts. One, Sheila would text me during the morning. It was a couple minutes before the bell when I felt my phone vibrate. Taking it out of my pocket showed me a text notification.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Help," it read.

"What is it?" I typed back.

"Wilson."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was both her homeroom and math teacher. Based on what she told me, he was also incredibly strict and would assign homework every chance he got. The first day of school was no exception.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Sounds rough. Wish I could help, but class is about to start."

"Okay, see you later."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I set my phone to vibrate and put my phone away. A quick aside, I was a gifted student with straight A's attending school. I'm not trying to brag, quite the contrary. Something I learned early was that as talent increases so does the amount of work someone must do. Thanks to mentoring by Dean and others I was already well into academics prior to enrolling.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In fact, the only reason I attended was that Dean legally couldn’t leave me home alone. It was a way to kill time while he was off doing missions he thought were too dangerous for me. There was some talk about putting me in a private school. However, he didn’t see the point in having that paid for when according to him, the truly important things are learned outside of class.

&#x200B;

“Hey.” someone whispered from my left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was my first time meeting another close friend of mine. He introduced himself as Brice and I told him my name.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you like Dragon Ball too?”

“How’d you know?”

He pointed to my wallet sticking from my pocket which had super saiyan two Gohan on it.

“Oh yeah, do you like it?”

“Hell yeah. I’ve seen every episode. Have you watched the original?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The teacher walked in, cutting our conversation short. As it turned out, Brice and I shared several classes together.  Over the next week, we talked more and more. Soon, I was talking to him almost as much as I did with Sheila. I told him about her as we were waiting to get picked up on Thursday.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think you and her would get along. She likes a lot fo the stuff we do,” I told him.

“She sounds pretty cool. Too bad she’s so far away.”

“We Skype sometimes. I could see about letting you on one of our calls.”

“If you can sure, I’d love to. Hey, why don’t we hang out sometime?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While Dean did encourage me to make friends, with our living circumstances things were complicated.  I couldn’t have anyone over due to some things we kept at home.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At your place?”

“Sure, what do you say tomorrow or Saturday?”

“Yeah, I just need to check with Dean.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His car pulled up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“See you tomorrow,” I said.

“Yeah,” Brice replied, giving me a wave.

When we pulled out of the parking lot, Dean went on a rant.

“Man, people have been up my ass all day.”

“About what?”

“I don’t even know where to start to answer that. First off, I got a flat on the way in. You’d think our people wouldn’t be slower than AAA, but apparently not. Secondly, the coffee machine broke and there was almost a breach which tops it all off with me having to spend most of the day on edge that something is going to break out. Anyway, how was your day?”

“Brice wants to hang out.”

“Does he? We’ll have to see about that then.”

“Well, I was wondering if maybe he could come over.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean shot me a brief glance and focused his vision back on the road.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I know,” I said. “I just wish we didn’t have to keep all these secrets.”

“Everyone has at least one. Just give it time. When you’re older you won’t be as restricted with this kind of thing.”

“I’ll take that as a no. Can I at least go over to his place tomorrow?”

“That depends.”

“On what?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean gave me a deadpan stare. A  sliver of apprehension grew within me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It's time for my second mission. Isn't it?"

"Bingo."

"Great, so what is it this time? Ghosts? Werewolves?"

"An exorcism."

“That was going to be my third guess. I take it we’re in for another long trip?”

“Actually, not that long. Where we’re needed is only a few hours away. With luck, we should be through and home by midnight. I already have the supplies we need in the trunk so we’re all good to go.”

“I better text Brice.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I let him know something came up and that tomorrow might work, but nothing was guaranteed. He replied back that it was fine and that he’d catch me later. During the ride, I inquired to Dean about the exorcism.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So, how exactly do we know if one is real? I mean, couldn’t it just be mental issues or something?”

“There’s a certain criteria they have to meet. Obviously, if it can be explained by conventional wisdom it’s best left to medical or mental health  professionals.”

“And if it can’t?”

“That’s where we come in. The signs of a legitimate possession revolve around drastic shifts in the behavior of the victim and unexplainable phenomena occurring around them. Say, somehow a door closes on its own and locks itself or something along those lines.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I nodded in understanding, then decided to pull out a book from my backpack to keep myself occupied. This time it was The Exorcist novel. While it did manage to get some things right, it was still far off the mark when it came to real exorcisms.  As an aside, it’s been a while since I had the time to sit down and get lost in a story. I keep finding my mind getting pulled back to my work.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It’s made it difficult to enjoy leisurely activities. Hopefully, I can get back to them someday. That’s not important right now, though. Getting back to my second mission, the home we arrived at belonged to a higher-class family. It’s more common with richer people since they can afford access to places where that sort of risk is greater or to buy objects with a similar property. I imagine warnings of curses tend to go ignored because the wealthy tend to think they are invulnerable.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At least that’s one advantage the poor have. We pulled up to a gate and Dean hit the intercom.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Hello?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The voice was shaky which made me nervous.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We’re the ones sent to deal with the Bairds”  problem.”

The gate opened and we proceeded. We parked near the driveway.

“I’m going in to assess the situation. You open the trunk and I’ll be out to let you know exactly what we’re dealing with.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He took the keys out of the ignition and handed them to me. We got out and he headed to the front door while I went to the trunk. In it were several different religious texts and corresponding items, varying bottles of different colored liquids and powders,  and clear crystals. These were all in separate bags.  I took them out and closed the trunk. I figured Dean might be a while so I decided to check my phone and saw another text from Sheila.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hey, you busy right now?”

“Kind of, but I can talk for a bit. I was meaning to talk to you about something.”

“What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I told her about Brice and how I thought they’d get along.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He sounds cool. Does he have a number?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I texted it to her and she thanked me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked up, seeing Dean with a grim expression. Right away, I knew that this was going to be more trouble than we intended. Putting my phone away, I asked how bad it was.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Fucking bad, this might be the worst one I’ve ever seen.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He l ran his fingers through the back of his hair, and let out a breath. I wasn’t even in the house yet and already I wanted to hop back in the car, speed away, and never look back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is there anything we can do then?” I asked.

“We can try. First, there are some things you need to know before we go in. There are different kinds of possession."

"So not just demons or ghosts?"

"No, I mean there are. Those aren't the only kinds, though."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He elaborated further. There are standard possessions where people are taken over by weak entities, be they demons or some other spirit such as a deceased soul or even something believed to be in folklore. These are the easiest to deal with. It gets harder when you have to combat the stronger ones. The reason is that they tend to have dedicated followers who are actively nourishing them through sacrifices.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fortunately, they don’t have too many so while difficult to banish, it isn’t impossible. The same can’t be said for this last kind. These are ones with a lot of name recognition and in fact, some aren't even native to Earth or known by anyone on this planet. Attempting to get them out of someone is like trying to scoop water out of a boat as more keeps trying to fill it. The short of all this is the hardest cases of this to face are ones where the entity is new to us and they have a lot of followers in places we can't contact.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"And it's the last kind in that house as we speak," Dean said, pointing to it. "The worst part is that  they lied about how long this has been going on."

"Does that matter?"

"A lot, it's like cancer, the longer you wait to treat it, the worse it gets. Now, we better not waste any more time. I have a feeling this is going to be a long night."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We grabbed our supplies, then headed in. Were it not for the current circumstances I would've thought the house looked rather nice and welcoming.  Contrasting its appearance, I got the sense it was looming over us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So, what's the plan here?" I asked as Dean knocked on the door.

"Persistence and just to warn you, I saw some fucked up shit in there so be prepared.”

“Easier said than done,” I murmured.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean didn’t hear me as he was in what I like to call mission mode. The door was opened by an older woman who I presumed to be the victim’s mother.  Her eyes were red and puffy. She introduced herself as Christa.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can you help Marcie?” she asked.

“We’ll do everything we can,” Dean replied, then we stepped inside.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A common trope when it comes to these situations is that the temperature of the surrounding home will drastically decrease. Although that does happen in some instances, it wasn't the case for us. Instead, there was this intense pressure. It felt vaguely akin to walking through a strong wind.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Before we go downstairs, tell us everything that has been tried so far," Dean said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In addition to the mother, the father,  Weston was there along with Marcie’s younger sister, Rosanne.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We've tried all we could think of," Weston answered. "Medicine, charms, you name it. We even tried to get some priests out here, but well, you saw how that went."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wondered what he meant by that and knew it couldn't mean anything good. Stone-faced, Dean motioned me to follow him. We got to the door going down to their basement.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Remember, things like this feed on fear. You can feel it, but do your best not to show it. Oh, and make sure you're out of her reach."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The basement was dim with only a single light illuminating it. The others were busted with the faint hum of electricity coming from the wires along with occasional sparks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where is she?” I whispered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My question was answered by a low moan. On all fours, she crawled into the light. It was easy to see why Dean was so freaked out before. She was in pajamas that I think were pink. It was hard to tell on account of the blood stains covering it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Speaking of, there were specs of it dried blood on her fingernails which were an unsettling length. Her toenails were in similar condition.  To make it worse I learned shortly that it belonged to someone else. Her skin had taken on a wilted complexion and there was a blindfold over her eyes. She sniffed the air.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Oh, you again.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don’t know how to describe her voice other than that it sounded unnatural. Dean’s face hardened further.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s with the blindfold?” I asked, thinking I was talking low enough for her not to hear me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Her head whipped in my direction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Someone new is with you.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My eyes were wide now. Dean glared at me, then focused back on the thing currently controlling Marcie.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You don’t need to concern yourself with him and we’re going to get you out of this girl,” Dean said.

“I see. Are you going to send more of those robed men? They tasted good You smell nice too. Why don’t you come closer?.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The implication of that made my stomach lurch. How completely would she have needed to devour them for there to hardly be any traces left? Dean then did something that I found shocking given the situation. He smiled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I doubt you’d want me. I probably taste terrible, but I have to wonder why someone as great as you would even bother with us lowly humans?"

"Don't think so highly of yourselves. You just happened to be the first species I came across."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*First? There are others?*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Well, allow us to show you out," Dean replied, reaching into one of the bags.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He pulled out one of the crystals and held it pointed at Marcie. It turned pitch black and a faint bead of sweat trickled down his forehead. My heart rate ticked up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What does that mean?" I asked, doing my best to make sure my voice didn't tremble.

"We aren't up against a ghost or some kind of demon. We're trying to vanquish a literal god."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart went from beating fast to abruptly ceasing. I tried backing away only for Dean to seize me by the arm. He squeezed hard, still keeping his gaze locked on Marcie. She cackled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"And I have trillions who bow to my whim."

"Regardless, you'll be leaving very soon."

"The others said something along those lines."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Suddenly, she lurched forward. I yelled and jumped back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Relax," Dean snapped at me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Breathing heavily, I willed myself to calm down. At the very least, the chains were doing a good job of restraining her. The downside was they did nothing about the scent which was iron mixed with rotted meat. She sniffed again and I asked myself why she kept focusing on me. Her face broke into a grin with her teeth also so stained with blood they appeared black.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How intriguing," she commented. "I can tell that there's something special about you, child."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I couldn't tell if she was serious or just messing with me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Just ignore her," Dean ordered, rummaging through one of the bags.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

From it, he pulled one of the jars. It was filled with pink powder. He poured some of it on his palm and threw it at Marcie. It hit her in the face and she breathed it in, coughing instantly. Dean then did the same thing with the other powders all with the same result.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I’m guessing none of them worked?”

“She rejected them. We’ll have to try something else. The problem is it requires us to get closer to her.”

“What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Marcie grinned wider and tilted her head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Please do, I want to know how you feel.”

“I don’t think this is a good idea.”

“We don’t have a choice. Just do as I say.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We began pouring out the jars of powder, creating a circle around Marcie. She tried to swipe at us. However, we were out of her range. When it was complete, Dean then pulled out the jars of liquid. One by one, he opened them and set them on the floor.  As he did, he ordered me to put crystals in each one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I did so, trying to ignore Marcie’s presence. When I dropped the crystals in, they started glowing, taking on the color of their corresponding liquids.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Okay, this next part is extremely important," Dean said. "You see the blindfold?"

"Yeah."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"They say the eyes are the window to the soul."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It clicked in my head what he wanted us to do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'm not going anywhere near her."

"When you're older, you'll be doing some of these alone. Do you trust me?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced from him to Marcie who gave off the air of a tiger ready to pounce. Every fiber of my being wanted me to bolt back upstairs. I trusted Dean, though, and still do.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yes.”

“Then watch carefully.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dean pointed to the circle, made a motion of breaking something in half, and then shook his head. I nodded in understanding and we walked forward. Dean went around the circle. Mentally, I cured him because that meant I had to be the one to distract Marcie. It did make sense, seeing as how she was fascinated with me for some reason.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Taking on such tasks at such a tender age, can’t leave a good impression.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My throat was dry. I coughed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s to prepare  me for dealing with things like you.”

&#x200B;

Dean was inching his way forward. He reached out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Is that so? Then I’ll show you what you’re in for.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She shot an arm behind her, grabbing Dean by the wrist. In the blink of an eye, she twisted her torso one-eighty and was crouching over him. My mind raced and luckily, I managed to think of something fast. I grabbed one of the crystals out of the jar and then ran at Marcie. From my viewpoint, she seemed to have her hands around Dean’s throat. Truth be told, I didn’t have a clue what the crystals were supposed to do and I was only hoping they’d help somehow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I touched the one I held to her face, she hissed as if burned. Now focused back on me, her neck extended slightly and twisted upside down, making her smile resemble a frown. Against my instant instinct to move back, I snatched off her blindfold with my other hand. Her eyes rendered me speechless. This is because, she didn’t actually have any, at least none that I could see.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In place of them was some kind of swirling mist with specs of flashing silver.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That was your last mistake, child.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I didn’t have time to react to what happened next. She breathed out and the mist stretched from her eyes and mouth, engulfing my head, I felt it enter me, through my ears. It was one of the most disgusting sensations I’ve ever experienced. It was as if there were worms wriggling inside me. I couldn’t hear, see, or even breathe.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then there was a voice in my head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I was right, You’ll make a much better host than this girl.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was so panicked I couldn’t even think. What happened next is something that even years later I still don’t understand.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Wait…No.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The way the tone sounded was bizarre. The best comparison I can draw is it was akin to someone cursing out somebody for cutting them off in traffic, then finding out it’s their boss. There was fear in the voice now. It kept repeating no. There was a feeling of bile in my throat. The next thing I knew, I was being shaken awake by Dean.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Zane,” he shouted repeatedly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I shot up, realizing first that we were still in the basement.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What happened? How long was I out?”

“Just a few minutes and your guess is as good as mine. I saw her breathing that shit into you and then you breathed it back out and somehow that cured Marcie.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I glanced back at Marcie who aside from her clothes wouldn’t seem different from any other deep-sleeping teenager.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where did the mist go?” I asked,

“It disappeared. I don’t think we’ll need to worry about it again any time soon.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I let out a long exhale.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let’s go home,” Dean said, helping me to my feet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We finished things with the Bairds.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We can’t thank you enough,” Weston told Dean as they shook hands.

“All in a night’s work,” he replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was accurate seeing as how the first rays of sunlight were already peeking over the horizon. I shook hands with Weston as well, then we left and began our drive.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How did that take so long?” I asked, exhausted.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He yawned before replying.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Eorcisms are like that. Plus, the one we did was exceptionally difficult, but you did well, Zane. Good job.”

"Thanks, I just want to go home right now.”

“You and me both.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My phone vibrated.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Talked with Sheila. Think she is cool. We still on for today?” the text from Brice read.

“Dean?”

“What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I showed him the text. Even though he was tired and annoyed, he agreed to take me to Brice’s house. I guess he figured I deserved something for helping out. Thankfully, we didn’t have to go too far out of the way, and following another text from Brice, we went to his address. Dean talked to me before I got out of the car.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I can’t lie. I am fucking beat so can you see about spending the night here?”

“I can try.”

“Okay.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He took out some cash and handed it to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What’s this for?”

“In case they decide to order something, you can offer to pay. It’s to be polite.”

“Oh, right.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I went into the glove compartment and took out an unopened toothbrush along with some toothpaste. We thought it’d be a good idea to have some in the future for long trips.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m happy you made it, Zane.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m glad to see you too. Hey, sorry to spring this on you and your parents, but would it be possible for me to spend the night?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’d be okay with it. Let me check. Hey, mom!”

“What?” came a voice from the other room.

“Can Zane spend the night?”

“Does he have a toothbrush and toothpaste?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He turned back to me. I held them up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, he has them!”

“Make sure he wipes his feet before coming in!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Before entering, I gave Dean a thumbs up. He waved, then drove off.

“Make yourself at home,” Brice said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After the horrors of the previous night, it was good to unwind. We played Budokai Tenkaichi 3 for a while despite my fatigue, I did decently. I wanted to enjoy playing with him for a lot longer and ended up falling asleep. Brice’s family was nice enough to put some covers over me.
