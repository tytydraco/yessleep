I met my boyfriend over a discord server, it was a server for people to find others to play video game's with. he was the only person I could find in the server that wanted to play deep rock galactic. at the time it was 10:47 he told me he didn't want to go on a voice call witch was fine.

after few months of a long distance relationship between us, we decided to meet at a McDonald's and he was as pretty as the pictures he had sent me. 

everyday I would play game's with him at 10 PM-1 or 3 AM and every time he would be muted while I talked, witch I always thought was weird. he lived nearby in an apartment so that we could hang out and go on date's without him having to fly all the time, though I knew he worked a low paying job so I always wondered how he could afford living in my state

a few months ago we started a Minecraft world and two days ago we finally beat the game, once we did he just left the discord call, it was only 11 so it was odd that he was going to bed then, but maybe he had a tough day so I didn't think much about it;

the next day I went to the taco bell he worked at on my lunch brake, I went up to the counter and one of our mutual friends told me that he wasn't there, I just ordered some food and left.

when I came home from work checked the dm he sent me, it said "stay up, I'm coming over." I responded with a "k" at 2 AM I was getting ready for bed, thinking he wasn't coming over when I heard a knock at the door.

I unlocked the door and opened it, a deep voice said "hey Sindy." I slammed the door and locked it, that was not a human, it wasn't even an animal I had no idea what the hell that was, I just knew it wasn't bill.

"Sindy, please let me in and explain." it said, how the hell did it know my name, I kept telling myself that I was dreaming and I was pinching myself, trying to wake up but I couldn't this wasn't a dream, this was real "please open the door." it said, I yelled back "why the fuck would I do that?!" it then told me that I could point my gun at it the whole time, I ran to it, picked it up, and before opening the door I turned off the safety.

it walked in and sat on the couch it's blue eyes glowed bright in the darkness, I pointed my gun at it from the kitchen "how do you know my name?!" it calmly told me that it was my boyfriend, how could this thing with bight blue eyes and long brown fur be my partner?!

"no! no your not! if you are my boyfriend then when is my birthday?!" it told me 2001 September 1st, maybe it robbed will, maybe will told it that his phone pin was my birthday, I asked it what my favorite color was and it told me that I named a shade of blue 'tony blue' and that it was my favorite, I know I told bill that over dm's so I still didn't believe him, I kept on asking him questions, until I asked "ok here's something that only bill will know, what did I give you on our 2nd date?"

"you gave me a silver ring, told me 'I'm not proposing to you or anything, I just thought you would like it' I lied to you on why I wouldn't take it, I told you that I didn't like to wear jewelry." 

all of what he said was true, but why is he like this? why is he this monster, I asked him what he was, if he was a skinwalker or something.

he told me that he was a Jabberwocky, he only played at 10 because he changed back into this. he wanted to live the life of a human, after a few years of his human life he had a job and even a phone and computer, he downloaded steam and discord, that's when we met, and I've already told you about that. I then asked how could he afford the apartment, he chuckled and said the guy who was renting it ran in fear by the sight of him.

he looked at me and asked me "are you scared of me?" I didn't answer, I just asked "why tell me, why tell me your a this?"

he took out a copper ring and said "I want to marry you, will you marry me?" I thought for a minute and told him that I had to think about it and that I needed to be alone, he set the ring in my hand and left, I went to bed and slept.

now I'm here with a copper ring on my desk thinking about what happened last night, I didn't want to tell him and I am terrified of him, because the ring had dried blood on it.
