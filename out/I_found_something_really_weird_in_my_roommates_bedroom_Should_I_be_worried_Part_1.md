Hey guys. The question’s in the title - I could really use some advice on this, and honestly, I don’t know who to ask. I tried posting on other subreddits but everyone said I was just making this all up. I’m hoping someone here will be willing to listen and help me figure out what to do, if anything.

To start out, I’ll tell you what you need to know about me, and as much as I can about my roommate. 

My name’s Brennan, and I’m a junior in college - I won’t say the name, but it’s an “elite” school in the south that I honestly wouldn’t have been smart enough to get into without football. I’ve been here on a sports scholarship for the last two years as a kicker for the football team. At the end of the day, I never actually cared that much about football. I thought it was fun, I was good at it, and it got me a free ride at one of the best colleges in my region. Plus I got unlimited food from any of the school cafeterias, which always felt like a win. 

Of course I didn’t get the kind of attention a quarterback gets, but it definitely won me some cred on campus, and a few looks from some of the cuter girls in my class. I even made it onto the posters the student government would put up around campus to hype everybody up before a big game, though that was really more embarrassing than anything else. The coaches and players on the team were always asking me if I wanted to play professionally after graduation, and I’ll admit, I did let the praise get to my head a bit.

I hadn’t made up my mind back then what I wanted to do, but at this point, professional sports are a lost cause anyway. I tore my ACL at the end of last school year. The doctors told me I’d need surgery to get back to playing, not to mention extensive rehab, and I still would never be back to 100%. I thought it over, talked with my parents about it, and ultimately just decided it wasn’t worth it.

Most of my social interaction was with other guys on the team, and I spent so much time practicing I didn’t have time to join a frat or clubs. I went to parties often as a freshman, but once the hangovers started interfering with my football performance, my parents pretty much forced me to sober up so I wouldn’t lose my scholarship. I can’t really say they were wrong to do it, but it definitely hurt my social life. I never realized how much people my age were obsessed with drinking until I became the one guy on the team who didn’t, and people started acting like I was a total square. Still, I had some friends left that I’d hang with after practice or study for tests together, so it wasn’t too bad. But the same friends started treating me like an outcast once I lost my spot on the team.

All that to say, here I am starting the fall semester of my junior year with no scholarship money, no friends, and not much to do with my time other than get a part-time job. I started working at the school cafeteria this summer, which sucks, but at least I work regular hours and the pay could be worse. But even with the income, I realized I still wouldn’t be able to afford the apartment I’ve been living in for the last year. I didn’t want to move at this point - the landlord mostly leaves me alone, the location is practically on campus, and the next-door neighbors aren’t noisy, smelly, or creepy. So, my dad suggested I find a roommate. 

Which brings me to Aldous. 

I honestly don’t know that much about the guy, but he seemed fine when I met him. The first thing I noticed was how clean and neat his whole outfit was, even the backpack wasn’t grimy like mine. The second was his eyes. Maybe I just haven’t met many people with green eyes, but the ones I can remember have all had at least some blue or brown mixed in, and this guy had eyes that were just straight up green as grass. Which is weirder than you think when you’re actually seeing it in person. Maybe that’s what made me feel like something was just a little bit “off” about him, though that effect seemed to wear off after a while. 

He was in my year, though I hadn’t had any classes with him or actually seen him around campus before. That made sense, not only because it’s a decently big school, but also because he and I didn’t really have anything in common. I found out he had been taking classes in Chemistry, Biology, Art History, and Anthropology. Meanwhile I was taking entry-level math and science just to meet graduation requirements and filling up the rest of my schedule with business and Econ classes, plus whatever electives upperclassmen on RateMyProfessor thought were easy and chill. 

Still, he was clearly clean and smart enough not to trash an apartment, and seemed like the quiet type. I was sure he wouldn’t be one to have crazy parties late at night or invite strangers into our space when I was trying to get work done. Maybe his smarts would even rub off on me – apparently we were signed up for the same psychology class that upcoming fall, so I hoped I could at least ask him for help if it turned out to be tougher than I thought. 

So, since I’d decided he wasn’t going to be a total freak or annoying as a roommate, I moved all the workout equipment I used to use and started sub-letting the room to Aldous. Yes, I know that’s not legal, but my landlord is kind of a pain in the ass and probably wouldn’t have let him move in until fall, and I needed the extra money as soon as possible. He agreed to pay half the rent and half the utilities, and promised he’d be sure not to inconvenience me as a roommate. 

*That* at least turned out to be true. He was pretty much the ideal person to room with. He was always polite and drama-free, always paid me his half of rent a few days in advance, kept the kitchen clean (even washing my dishes sometimes if I put it off more than 30 minutes or so), never used up all the limited hot water in the shower, and even rearranged a few things in the living room that made it way more neat and organized. Even though it was summer, he spent a lot of time at the campus library or working in his room, so he never bothered me, but also didn’t complain when I played music or watched TV in the main area while he was working. The few times I asked him to hang out, he politely told me he didn’t have time but appreciated the offer. Sure, he wasn’t the most outgoing, maybe a little too formal if you ask me, but he made up for it - especially when he’d “make a bit too much” food at dinner and let me help myself to a free meal. He never cooked anything too fancy, but it was fresh, and a hell of a lot better than the cup noodles and frozen meals I usually eat while the main dining hall is closed on the weekend. *Man*, I miss the athletic center cafeteria now that I don’t have access anymore.

Overall, I pretty quickly got used to having Aldous around, and I felt like I’d struck gold finding this guy. He himself seemed happy with the arrangement too, and I figured once school started I’d be even more glad to have the extra help with chores, so I didn’t expect any problems this fall. Then things started getting weird. 

Aldous had told me before the semester started that he’d been planning to start a research project, which would take up most of his time after class in the evenings. Apparently it was for a course called “Science in Medieval Literature,” whatever that meant. When I asked, he told me the names of the other classes in his schedule, and they all seemed kinda obscure, except for the developmental psychology class we were both signed up for.  There was one called Mind-Body Medicine, some high-level biology or chemistry lab, and “Ancient Latin Philosophy” or something like that. I can’t remember the rest. He said he was triple-majoring, so I guess he really had to pack a lot into his schedule this year. What he was going to do with all that random knowledge is beyond me, but he told me he was “still deciding” what to do after college and he’d probably end up in grad school. That sounded about right- this guy seemed to be into school more than anyone else I’ve ever met. Even his name and appearance were nerdy. He wears round glasses, collared shirts, sometimes with sweaters on top, with long jackets and ironed pants. His hair is probably a little less than shoulder-length? (I’ve never actually seen it down), and he wears it pulled pack in a short ponytail most of the time. He always goes out in these “dark academia” style outfits that are all over TikTok these days. I’ll admit, he must pull it off well, at least based on the smitten looks I’ve seen him get from girls on the few times we’ve walked back from class together. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little jealous. Not that any amount of attention would be worth it to me to walk across campus in *that* kind of getup, but still. 

Sorry, I know it seems like a lot of random information at this point, but I’m trying to tell you everything I know about Aldous cause I have no clue what could turn out to be relevant. Anyway, when class started up, everything was normal for the first week or two. Usually he’d stop by the library on the way home, but 3 days a week we had our psych class together last period and like I said, he walked home with me a few times. He’d always talk to me if I started a conversation, and he does have a weird kind of charisma when he talks (maybe a little too smooth? Everything is starting to seem suspicious now), and he always seemed interested in whatever I was saying, so it was enjoyable enough. But once we got home he’d get all serious and say he had to “get to work” immediately. At first he kept up his routine with the cooking and cleaning, but by week three he was just taking cup noodles to his room every night just like I used to. He also wakes up super early in the mornings now - I’ll get up every time and see the light on in his room and a single bag of chips or something missing from the kitchen. He still keeps everything clean, which is great, but I have no idea how he has time for it. By now, a little over a month in, I hardly ever see him anymore, and I’m wondering if the only time he eats a real meal is when he’s on campus for lunch between classes. Even on the weekends, he disappears off to the library, either the one at school or the city public library, comes home with tons of books, and then holes up in his room.

That’s all weird, but I wasn’t actually worried until the day before yesterday. It was a Saturday, I was watching TV in the living room when all these packages started getting dropped off at the door. Some were from Amazon, but some looked like they were from some kind of specialty website. They were all marked with Aldous’s name. Some of them were heavy, most were marked as “fragile,” so I had to be pretty careful carrying them in. I wondered how much it all cost. I think Aldous has family money or something, but he usually doesn’t seem to spend much, so it seemed kinda out of character for him. He was at the library at the time so I went to leave the boxes in his room. 

I hadn’t actually been in there before, but it looked about like what I would imagine. He had bookshelves stocked with thick books, a large desk covered in papers and books with too many bookmarks, and a bunch of potted plants I had seen him carrying when he moved in. And of course, apart from the desk, everything looked totally clean and organized. It even smelled better than my room, I hate to say. But there wasn’t that much to see in there, and I didn’t want to snoop, so I just set down the boxes next to the desk and went back to watching my show. When Aldous got home, I told him about the boxes, and he only stopped to take his shoes off and wash his hands before hurrying to his room to unpack. I heard quiet clinking sounds every once in a while that night, even after I went to bed around 11:00, but I didn’t think too much about it. 

The next day though, it was Sunday and time for homework. I ended up getting confused on the Dev Psych reading so I went and knocked on Aldous’s door. I hadn’t seen much of him that day, other than when he went to the kitchen to get a bowl of cereal around 9 am and then retreat back to his room. It was 6 PM now, so I hoped he’d be done with whatever he was working on, or at least could take a break long enough to help me out. He opened the door, looking a little surprised but not mad when I asked if he could come out and help me. He agreed and then went to get some papers off his desk. It was then that I noticed something bizarrely out of place, sitting on what I think was a new table by the window. 

It was some kind of lab setup, full of tubes and bottles and with weird liquids and powders inside. Some of it looked a little too piss-colored for my liking, but then a worse thought occurred to me.

“Dude, what the hell is that?” I demanded as Aldous turned back towards me. “You better not be cooking meth or something in here. My landlord *and* my parents would kill me if I had let a drug dealer live illegally in my apartment for over 2 months. 

Aldous gave me a confused look, his head tilted to one side slightly. “Does this look like a meth lab to you?”

I thought back to watching Breaking Bad in high school and remembered how big the lab setups were. And I didn’t see any barrels full of chemicals around here, either. But then again, it’s not like I had any real-life experience. 

“Either way you can’t be doing chemistry in here,” I said, irritated. “You’re going to make the whole apartment stink. Or burn the place down.”

Aldous stared at me for a moment, his odd green eyes giving me a weird feeling as they met mine. He seemed like he was trying to decide on something, for a second. Then he said, “It’s not for chemistry.”

Now that I was sure was bullshit, I had to take an intro chemistry lab class my first year here and I know what the equipment looks like. I told him that.

“This isn’t for chemistry,” he repeated, not breaking his uncanny stare. “It’s for alchemy.”

“What is that supposed to mean?” I asked. I’d heard the word before, and I knew it had something to do with making stuff into other stuff, but then as far as I know, that’s also what chemistry is, so I wasn’t sure it was any better.

“I won’t be using a burner or heat source,” Aldous continued. “There won’t be any danger, I assure you. And it won’t create any smells. I promise,” he added, apparently noticing my narrowed eyes, “it’s perfectly safe and perfectly legal. It won’t cause any problems for you at all.”

I still thought the whole thing was weird as hell, but for whatever reason, I actually believed he was being honest. “Fine,” I said, “but if you jack up my apartment, I swear I’ll make you pay for all of the repairs and then some.”

“That won’t be a problem,” he assured me. “Now, what was it you wanted to ask me about the assigned reading?”

By that point, I had totally forgotten about the homework. I started to tell him about the passage in question when I suddenly saw something on a paper on his desk. It was some kind of strange symbol, like one of those astrology signs but way more complicated. I felt weirdly compelled to go look at it more closely. But when I got to the desk and the symbol was in full view, I started to feel sick. I couldn’t make myself look away from it, but the longer I stared, the more my stomach turned. I began to feel stressed, on the verge of sweating; like I was having a premonition that something bad was about to happen. 

Aldous must have noticed something wrong because he grabbed my shoulder. “Are you all right? What’s the matter?”

The touch seemed to snap me out of it, and I backed up quickly. *What was that? Am I losing my mind?* I wondered. 

“Nothing, I’m fine,” I lied. “Let’s just get this homework over with. I’m pretty tired, I think I’ll go to bed early tonight.”

“All right then, let’s have a look,” Aldous said, leading me out of his room and closing the door behind him. 

We spent about an hour talking about the homework. Busy as he said he was, Aldous didn’t rush me and took time to answer all my questions and share his own thoughts. By the end, I was feeling better, and the reading was crystal clear to me, like I’d unlocked a whole other way of seeing it. I was so grateful for the help, and even a little excited to be prepared to talk intelligently in class for once, that I forgot about the creepy symbol and chemistry set until I was in bed, closing my eyes for the night. It was then that the mental image of it came back to me in full force. 

I jumped up out of bed immediately and ran to the bathroom. I barely made it to the toilet in time to avoid throwing up all over the floor. I sat on the ground, staring at the remains of my dinner in the toilet for I don’t know how long before I got up, washed my mouth out, and stumbled back to bed. I had to work hard to think about other things, even tried counting sheep like the old adage, to keep myself from seeing that symbol in my mind. When I finally fell asleep, I had terrible dreams all night, full of images of twisted people and places like pictures generated by a shitty AI. I woke up this morning feeling like shit, though at least not nauseous again. I felt like I had been run over by a bus as I dragged myself to the kitchen. As I passed by Aldous’s room, I saw his light was on and he was already up. Probably mixing chemicals or writing creepy symbols, I thought. Immediately the symbol from the night before started to pop up in my mind, but I was able to shove it back, and a wave of nausea passed over me for a second. 

Since then I’ve been nervous all day trying to keep that mental image at bay. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve had stomach colds, even food poisoning before, but this feels totally different. I don’t have a fever or anything. I wasn’t even feeling sick at all until I saw that freaky symbol in Aldous’s room. Am I going crazy? Is something like that even possible?

Plus, on top of that, several times today I was hit with a strong feeling someone was watching me. It even happened once while I was alone in the bathroom washing my hands, and was sure there was no way anyone could see me. It really added to my anxiety about the whole situation.

I’m at a loss for what to do now. I don’t think going to the doctor is going to help, especially if it’s all just in my head. But, for some reason, I just *feel* like it isn’t. I don’t how how else to explain it, but it feels like there is something really bad going on here and this is only the beginning of it. Still, I don’t think I can just kick out my roommate because of a weird feeling and what logically is probably just a stomach bug. And I certainly can’t just find somewhere else to live at this point, with classes already in full swing.

Right as I’m typing this, Aldous is walking past the couch to the kitchen, and just knowing his bedroom door is open makes my brain feel itchy, thinking about that symbol again. And even though his back is turned, I’m again getting the sense of eyes focused on me. 

If anyone has any ideas about what all this means, or what I should do about it, could you please let me know?
