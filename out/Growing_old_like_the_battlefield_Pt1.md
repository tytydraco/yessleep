Wars had always been one of my favorite topics in history. The cleverness of generals, the advancements of technology. And especially some of the mysteries surrounding a lot of the older wars. Mysteries in modern wars had never had the same touch because it just felt like the government was hiding it, and not something unexplainable or the truth eroded by time.

Growing up I could never keep any friends because of these weird interests. Friends always coming and going as I got older. However the one friend that never left me was my brother. He was just as weird as me, if not weirder, he liked war because of the weaponry. He found the idea of loading a musket from the front, crude but genius and cool for the time.

Now we both talk giddily in the car as he drives, the destination? Spotsylvania, Virginia. To the battle of the wilderness.

We both lived in Florida so it took a while (A good eleven hours), but neither of us minded as we had each others company to prattle on about facts we both already knew but also knew the other enjoyed speaking about. I spoke about the tactics used by the famed General Grant and lee, as he spoke about the spencer repeaters fielded by the confederate and union cavalrymen alike.

The drive seemed to go by too fast, most likely due to our constant yammering as we started driving past Spotsylvania county both me and him went quiet as we looked around, two kids in a candy store. We passed it though and continued on to Fredericksburg, where we would be staying. Before we came up we decided to stay for one week so we could have time to explore both the Wilderness and Fredericksburg.

Continuing through the city, the conversation still dead, I pipe up to Lucas (my brother) “Luke, do you think we’ll find any treasures? or maybe at least some Minié (Pronounced min-YAY) shots?” Lucas turned to me then and exclaimed “I hope we find at least a rifle!” I laughed it off, knowing he was just giddy, and that they usually recover the weapons from the field for continued use. I think he already knew that but I didn’t put down his excitement.

We finally pulled into this small lodge called, ironically, “America’s Best Value Inn.” As soon as he put the car into park I opened the door and stepped out, cracking my back theatrically, continuing to stretch as he gets out. I look over to him and go “Hey do you mind checking us in? I’d like to check on the equipment and make sure we didn’t forget anything” I know that we could’ve double checked before we left, but we were both too excited to waste anymore time.

I was also sure anything that whatever we needed, we could’ve bought since this is a hot spot for people like us. Without a word he nodded and walked off, always the quiet man when he wanted to be. I walk around to the trunk of our car and open it, peering inside I find our two metal detectors along with the pair of shovels, our duffel bags and a few other trinkets to help with our searches.

After concluding that we didn’t have to waste anymore money, I pick up our duffel bags and close the trunk. As I start to walk around I notice a flash of movement in the trees. Our lodge was on the very edge of town so there was a considerable amount of woods around, but I couldn’t rack my brains on what would be red and living in an area like this.

I squint my eyes and the hairs on my neck as it felt like I was staring into the abyss, just then my brother slaps his hand on my back as I jump and I started panting.

I hadn’t realized I was holding my breath.

He looks to me curiously and inquired “what’s got you so spooked Derrek?” I looked back to him. “I just thought I saw an animal, it looked kinda creepy so I was trying to see if I could get a better look.” The adamant disbeliever of the paranormal or any kind of unnormal, he smiled and shrugged “You know animals don’t usually like hanging around more populated areas.”

I decided not to mention that what I saw looked blood red.
