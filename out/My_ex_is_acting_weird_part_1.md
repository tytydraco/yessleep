I'm  not going to lie I have a weird life.i won $1000  a day for life. Right after my year off. I went to college for music. I meant a girl who I dated throughout college we broke a few months after but were on good terms. Not long after she started dating my sister. Trust me that took alot of getting used to but not where the strangeness ends. 

After 6 months of her dating my sister. She moved in which wasn't a problem  my family had the house and rooms for it. 

I sometimes have a hard time sleeping. I've always been this way. So my sleep schedule is all over the place. One night I went to go to the gaming room to play some games for a bit then head back to bed. As I walked down the hall and passes the living room. I saw my ex. She was sitting on the couch with nothing  but a towel on. I guessed that she had just gotten out of a late night shower. She was flipping through channels as I walked passed behind her. She didn't seem to notice or didn't care. I went and played some games for about two hours before heading back to bed.  As I walked passed the living room again she was gone back the towel was still there. So I grabbed it and threw it in the laundry room. 

The next day I  pulled her side to talk to her about it. I told her it was fine to take late night showers but just don't l3ave the towel in the living room. She looked confused and just said okay. At the time I  thought that she just didn't notice me walk by that night. 

The day went by as normal there was nothing that stood out. Tho she seemed to get a bit embarrassed when she saw me. I just brushed it off as she was just embarrassed that she forgot her towel in the living room and didn't notice. 

A few days went by before the next time I saw her late at night. This time she was in a Bathrobe. I again just walked passed and played games for a few hours. As I left the gaming room  I was greeted with a sticky note  on the door. It said don't come down stairs tomorrow night. I figured her and my sister were let's say going to have some fun and didn't want to be interrupted. Morning came and she won't even come near me. We tried asking her why but she just won't say.  She spent most of  that day in her and my sisters room. My family questioned my about but there was nothing I could think of except for the times I saw her at night but that didn't make since to anyone. 

Night came I was just awake in my room watching YouTube. As I  heard a movie or show playing on the TV in the living room below. I was started to hear some creaks and banging. After awhile there was what sounded like muffled moans so I just turned  up the volume on my phone so I couldn't hear them. It was almost 6:30am when they stopped. I decided to get up at 7. I opened my door to find a doll. A small one handmade with thread. It was female with black hiar and blue eyes. I picked it up and something just felt off about it. I put in on my desk then went and made myself some breakfast. I saw her in the kitchen she was making something with my sister. She saw me and ran up to me and gave me a hug.  I was taken back. I asked if we were okay? Because she had been avoiding me. She just looked put at me and said we've always been okay then she smacked my ass and wentin to her room.  Me and my sister just looked at each other like wtf just happened. 

My sister said that she just might be really excited for the party later tonight. Apparently her and my sister are going  to have some friends over for the night. They also wanted me to be there because one of their friends is single like me. I said okay. 

Later that day their friends arrived  and the one the wanted to pair me up with was beautiful. Her name was Nicole. We wond up getting along really well  no one could separate us that night. We pair up for every game we played that night. It was amazing. At the end of the night the others went to the home theater to watch movies. Me and Nicole went up to my room. That night I didn't  play video games. I  woke up the next day right next to Nicole who was cuddling me. She was my new partner.  I got up to make everyone breakfast. After I went to wake everyone up but my sisters and the guest rooms were empty. So I  walked other to the home theater. I thought they had fallen asleep watching a movie. I opened the door and saw they had fallen asleep after having some fun. I closed the door as fast as I could and had Nicole go wake them up.when the got to the table where breakfast was waiting I asked how the rest of their night was. They said the fell asleep watching movies. 

After breakfast everyone left except for Nicole. We faced off with a game of pool and I didn't even stand a chance. She left I'm the afternoon but said she would be back that night. My sister Test teased about it my ex also joined in. 

Not long after Nicole was with me everyday. One night we woke up to weird sounds coming from one of the guest rooms. The sounds were animalistic. We went down stairs but by the time we got there the sounds stopped. They were replaced the sounds of people having fun. We figured they had just been watching some movie or something. We went to the game room played some games together for a few hours. We decided to got to the home theater and watch movies for the rest of the night. As we walked pass the living room. We saw my ex there naked just looking out the window.  Nicole called her name but she didn't respond. We walked up to her and waved our hands in front of her still no response we figured she was just sleep walking. She we left her be and went on to the home theater. 

The next day a woman went miss. It was all over the news she had just vanished. They were searching the woods behind her work and asked if there was anyone who know anything to please come forward.  
A few days went by and we found my ex again looking out the window not responding to anything.then thenext day another woman went missing. Me and Nicole started to get worried about  my ex does she have some to do with it? Why us she just looking out the window? We asked her if she remembers doing it  and she said no.
 
Few nights later me and Nicole  found her again looking out the window  so we went out to find out what she was looking at. We didn't find anything so we went back in side and my ex had just finished playing with herself. Me and Nicole  a
Were getting really worried about this. The next morning we told my ex what happed. She didn't believe us. She began to believe that we had never seen her at night and were just pranking her. After breakfast she turned on the news. One of the missing woman was found dead earlier that morning. Me and Nicole looked at eacher worried. We came up with a plan. 

The plan was to record me ex looking out the window and she what else she does and how long she stays there . A week later we catch her looking out the window again. We set up the camera and went back upstairs. The next morning again an other woman went missing. She showed her the tape and she still didn't believe us she said we edited the video. Even tho we were showing her on the camera.
