My wtf scary/weird experience



I don't believe in ghosts, I'm not religious. I mean that. Atheist pure and true. I'm like Thomas though, if I should someday, somehow experience something for myself, with my own eyes, while awake, I might just open my mind to it. After all, I don't believe because I've never seen, not because I think I know better than everyone else. That being said, my two younger sisters, do. I'm close to 40, they're early thirties. We sometimes have girls night and, when they start talking about their...shall we say, unexplained experiences or stuff they heard about, I do come here (love reddit) from time to time, to read them some posts about the paranormal, just to get a good scare out of them. (can't help it, please don't judge haha, we love horror movies ) This is where it gets interesting, 2 nights ago, we had one of em girls nights, I read some more stories to them and they ended up really trying to get me to believe in all that crap. I kept saying over and over and over, Sorry girls, I just don't believe in all that stuff. Though I felt kinda bad about basically saying, I do not believe your stories, in a way.... 

Later that night, when I went to bed in the basement guest room of my youngest sisters huge house, I was reading a few pages on my kindle app before falling asleep, tucked in, in the dark. Now, please note, my younger, scared sisters sleep on the top floor of the house which is 2 floors above me. When I finally put down my kindle, fluff the pillow and shut my eyes, I Distinctly hear, VERY close to my ear (it felt like I could physically feel the breath), You should. Not a whisper, just a regular conversation volume. I turned around so fckng quick, to make sure no one was there (pay back would've been pretty funny and well, deserved) but, no one was there. Besides, the voice had a male tone to it, suave, too. Sounded almost, amused. 

The house was so quiet, I would've heard if someone came down and then creeped back up two flights of stairs. I admit, I got some chills. Okay lots. Told my sisters the next morning and their faces were white as milk, (my sister who lives there started thinking it might be hauntedðŸ™„). Think what you will, I'm not even sure what the f that was or if I want to know...........next girls night will be romcoms and rosÃ© haha! We'll eventually get back to our usual scary stuff someday I suppose.... Btw, I think the You should was a reply to my earlier Sorry girls, I don't believe in all that crap.... Which I said a few times throughout the night (and No, I wasn't drunk, I don't drink much, maybe 3 coronas thru the evening, and I've got adhd meds I still take which keep me alert and awake later than most, thus the late night reading, must've been 2-3 am when we went to bed after washing our faces and all that). So yeah, weird......
