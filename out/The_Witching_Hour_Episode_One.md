

Welcome, dear readers of r/nosleep, to the first episode of my new ongoing series, The Witching Hour. Every week, I'll bring you a fresh tale of anonymous horror submitted by brave souls who lived through their nightmares. Names, places, and details have been altered to protect everyone—and everything—involved.

But this isn’t just another post on a subreddit. From now on, I’ll be actively engaging with you, reacting to your theories, comments, and fears as we navigate these tales together. Think of this as our own little corner of darkness, a place where stories and chills intertwine.

Tonight, we begin with an update to a story many of you may remember. Years ago, a redditor shared their harrowing experience of being stalked by a mysterious creature while homeless in the woods. Now, they’ve come forward with a follow-up, and it's more terrifying than ever.

So settle in, turn off the lights, and listen closely.

[I’m a homeless veteran living in the woods,something is stalking me at night ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x7sdp9/im_a_homeless_veteran_living_in_the_the_woods/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)


"I was a homeless veteran living in the woods, something has followed me to my new home."

“This is an update to a story I posted several year’s ago. I had left the military in search of a better life in Kansas City. When I first got here, I was homeless, I had to sleep in my car for a few weeks until my first paycheck came in, and I could afford a place to live. In those few weeks, I encountered a creature stalking the woods I was forced to park by due to my situation. I even attempted to change my camping site miles away from where I originally encountered the creature. It didn’t help.

Night after night, that thing would find me. It would lightly tap on my window to try to get my attention. It knew I was aware of it at this point. I never dared look back at it. Seeing that hideous grin once in my life was more than enough. It felt like every night got worse. It stopped lightly tapping my glass and started scratching at it, maniacally, desperately, so much that sleep was impossible. I hadn’t been able to sleep in days. In fact, my mental health was beginning to be affected to a point I thought about finally confronting that bastard one night. I had thought of it all day, I’d stay awake and wait for it, maybe run over it with my car, doing something was better than the nightly torture it put me through.

So I waited…and waited, hour’s went by until I passed out due to sheer exhaustion. Just when I thought I could finally get some semblance of rest that night, my car began to shake violently. I thought it was an earth quake until I ripped the sheet from my face and saw that the thing had grabbed the back of my car and was shaking it side to side. I never imagined this thing could be so strong. Then I came to a terrible realization. Upon seeing the crazed look on its face, I realized it was salivating. It wasn’t trying to scare me anymore. It was trying to get in.

In a dazed panic, I jumped over my driver’s seat and attempted to start my car engine. It felt like an eternity, but I was able to force my key in the ignition, only to have my car stall. I look back and see that the trunk door is ready to come off it’s hinges, I was moments away from certain death as a pair of headlights come into view. As the vehicle, the creature drops my car and seemingly vanishes. I keep trying to start my engine and begin worrying the thing might’ve sabotaged it so its meal wouldn’t squirm away. 

The vehicle that was approaching us had parked a few feet in front of my car, and a man came out pointing a flashlight in my direction. 

“Sir, get back in your vehicle!” I cracked my window down slightly to try and warn the stranger. “There’s something out here, get back in the car and—” before the man could get the confused look off his face, a burst of red mist came out of some part of his body. The bright light emitted from his flashlight turned to a bright red hue for a few seconds, he could only scream as that thing was on him, ripping chunks of flesh with those razor Sharp claws. 

I panicked and tried to turn my car engine on desperately, trying to ignore the horrendous carnage in front of me. Miraculously, my car roared on, and my headlights immediately activated. There was nothing left of the poor bastard that pulled over only minutes ago. There was only a pile of minced meat and snapped bones where I last saw that thing ripping into him. Before I could register the thought of where that thing had run off to, it slammed against the side of my driver seat window. It only stared at me for maybe five seconds before it licked the window that was between us. I stepped as hard as I could on the gas and got out of there like a bat out of hell. I drove for hours trying to put as much distance between that thing and me until my car was running low on gas.

I stopped next to a gas station to try and catch my breath after such a traumatic night when I got a notification on my phone. It was a message from my bank alerting me that my paycheck had just become available. 

 since that terrible night, I was able to rent a nice house and rescue a dog that I named Sam. I moved far away from the area that creature appears to have claimed as it’s domain and things have been very peaceful until…

Sam started barking around midnight, I tried to comfort her before heading to bed. My new house had a pretty expensive security system: cameras, lights, and motion trackers. If anyone or anything was lurking anywhere near my home, the security system would pick it up. Around 3am, I slowly woke up from a nightmare I could only faintly remember. I woke up only to realize my reality was much more terrifying than any dream my mind could conjure up. While laying in bed halfway covered in my sheets, I could hear something clawing away at the walls of my house. First, it was barely audible, and then the scratching became faster, more desperate. 

As if to confirm my fears, I reach for my phone on my nightstand where security notifications all read motion detected in multiple areas around my house. I jumped out of the bed and headed toward the living room. I saw Sam shivering in a corner, and she immediately moved towards me, I grabbed a shotgun I purchased in case this thing ever happened to find me again. “it should be enough to take it out if I get a good shot in, right?” I said to myself or maybe to Sam as some sort of reassurance that this confrontation would somehow end with me beating this thing. I swallowed hard as I opened the door to exit out of the safety of my house, I was done cowering in fear of that thing, and I would at least hurt it bad tonight.

 My confidence and anger faded fast as I took my first few steps into my backyard. It was large and dark, the security lights only able to illuminate so much. I felt watched by a thousand eyes in the darkness surrounding my home. As my eyes focused, I saw something that turned my bravery and wrath into cowardness even with the death dealing tool in my hands. Maybe 50 feet in front of me in the wood line, I could see a grotesque face smiling back at me. Then another, and another. I shot at the growing number of demonic creatures in front of me and bolted back inside, slamming the door shut with every ounce of strength I had left. My entire body trembled as I shoved a nearby dresser against the door, bracing it as if that alone could keep those things out. Sam was barking wildly, her normally loyal and protective nature replaced with primal terror. Her whines and growls only added to the oppressive chaos that had consumed my home.

The creatures didn’t wait long. The relentless pounding and clawing began again, louder and more forceful than before. It felt as if my house was under siege from an unstoppable force. The walls quaked, the windows rattled, and the sound of splintering wood echoed as they tested every possible way in. I scrambled to every window and door, ensuring they were locked and barricaded, my shotgun still clutched tightly in my hands. My palms were slick with sweat, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios.

Sam followed me everywhere, her tail tucked tightly between her legs. She let out sharp barks whenever one of the creatures came close to a window or door. The security lights outside flickered erratically, revealing quick glimpses of the horror. Through the small gaps in my boarded-up windows, I could see them—those hideous grins, their hollow, glowing eyes, and those long, clawed fingers dragging across my walls.

The notifications on my phone were relentless, each one confirming what I already knew: Motion detected in the backyard. Motion detected at side door. Motion detected in driveway. They were everywhere. The house groaned under the stress of their assault, and for a moment, I thought they might actually tear the place apart.

I fired more shots through the windows, aiming blindly at the grotesque shapes moving in the darkness. The loud blasts seemed to buy me a few moments of reprieve, but they always came back—hungrier, angrier. At one point, the scratching on the back door became so frantic that I feared it would give way. I moved to reinforce it, my heart racing, when a massive thud against the side of the house shook me to my core. Whatever had caused it was much larger than the others.

As I stood there, breathing heavily, the power in the house flickered. The security cameras displayed static for a few agonizing seconds before returning to their feed, showing multiple areas of the property swarming with those things. The lights outside dimmed momentarily, casting long, eerie shadows across the yard. The largest of the creatures stepped into view—a towering figure with elongated limbs and a face far more grotesque than the others. Its mouth stretched unnaturally wide, revealing rows of jagged teeth that gleamed in the flickering light.

I was running low on ammo and running out of options. My fingers fumbled as I loaded my last few shells into the shotgun. Sam whimpered, pressing herself against my leg as if begging me to make it stop. I whispered to her, "It’s okay, girl. We’re going to be okay," though I doubted the truth in my own words.

And then, just as despair was starting to take hold, the sound of sirens broke through the chaos. The faint but distinct wail of approaching emergency vehicles grew louder, their lights casting blue and red flashes against the walls of my home. The creatures froze, their attacks ceasing almost instantly. For a moment, there was an eerie silence as the sirens grew closer, the sounds of car engines pulling into my driveway breaking the stillness.

The creatures began retreating, disappearing into the shadows one by one. Even the massive one that had terrorized me from the yard seemed to melt into the darkness as the first set of headlights swept across my property. I collapsed against the wall, the shotgun slipping from my hands as I struggled to catch my breath.

Multiple officers approached the house, their flashlights piercing the darkness. “Police! Is anyone inside?” one of them called out. I staggered to the door and unlocked it, my face pale and drenched in sweat. The officers took one look at me and immediately grew concerned.

“What happened here?” one asked, stepping cautiously inside and scanning the room with his flashlight.

I tried to explain, my voice trembling as I recounted the night’s events. They looked skeptical at first—until I showed them the notifications on my phone and led them outside to see the damage. Deep claw marks covered the walls and doors, the porch light was shattered, and the windowsills bore the telltale signs of something trying to pry them open.

The officers were stunned. “What could have done this?” one muttered, running his fingers over the jagged gouges in the wood.

“No idea,” another replied, shaking his head as he took pictures of the destruction. “But whatever it was, it wasn’t human.”

Despite their efforts, no evidence of the creatures themselves was found. No footprints, no blood, no fur—nothing to prove what I’d seen. But the damage was undeniable, and my phone’s notifications corroborated my story enough to keep them from dismissing me outright. They promised to file a report and assured me they’d have patrols in the area.

As they left, I stood in the doorway, staring into the blackness of the woods where the creatures had vanished. The air was still, the only sound the distant hum of the officers’ engines fading into the night. The house was silent now, but the deep scars they had left behind—on my home and my mind—served as a chilling reminder. They weren’t gone. They were just waiting.
