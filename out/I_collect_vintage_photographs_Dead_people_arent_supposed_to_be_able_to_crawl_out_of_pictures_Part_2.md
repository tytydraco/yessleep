To say that Addy was a bit upset about what had happened to me would be making an understatement of epic proportions. She’d been on her way home when she’d seen the deluge of cop cars pull out of our driveway and panicked, almost running our mailbox over in a frantic attempt to get up to the house. I’d been looking out of the kitchen window when I’d seen the squarebody Suburban we used to haul groceries and camera equipment screech to a halt in front of our garage.   


For the next hour we sat together in the living room, her listening as I told her what had gone down in the basement. She’d sat in silence for a time when I finished. The only sounds that could be heard were the soft pops and cracks of the flames in the fireplace, along with the ticking of the clock on the wall. Finally, she let out a deep breath and spoke. “So…they don’t think whoever it was will come back?” She looked up at me with worried, slightly fearful eyes. I shook my head. “No, they don’t. They said he’ll either try and find another house to break into, or, more likely, he’ll just get out the area altogether, before he’s caught” She nodded, giving a small smile, but I could tell my words hadn’t fully convinced her.  


Even still, she stood up and made both of us a drink, bringing them over before sitting down again. As the two of us slowly sipped the gin and tonics, a thought remained in the back of my mind. I hadn’t told the cops about what I’d heard in the basement. But, as much as I felt hesitant, Addy was someone I didn’t keep secrets from. So, after taking a particularly large pull on my drink, I sat the glass on the coffee table and leaned forward. “Addy…” I began, tapping my fingers together as I tried to figure out how to say it to her. She looked at me, recognizing instantly that something was on my mind and leaning forward as well. “There’s…there’s one thing I didn’t tell the cops” A puzzled look fell over her face. “What?” she asked. I let out a loud *whoosh* of air. “I…I really don’t know how to explain it, or describe it, and part of me even feels like I either had a mental break from fear down there, or am thinking too deep into things…” I trailed off  


She reached out and rested her hand on my arm. “Babe, it’s okay. You know you can tell me anything, no matter how crazy you think it might sound” I couldn’t help but smile slightly. *Thank God for you, Addy*. I took a deep breath. “When I was down there, in the dark, hearing the intruder moving around…I swear…I swear I heard someone else yell out” Instantly, I felt her grip on my arm tighten, and though she kept her expression level, I saw her eyes flicker towards the kitchen behind me. I continued. “Right before the guy charged me, there was another voice. A woman’s voice. One that warned me about him” I shook my head slightly. “After I’d dodged him, it came again, yelling for me to run. And that wasn’t the only thing. Before the lights went out, I thought I smelled perfume down there. Strong as hell” I looked up at Addy. A serious expression adorned her face now.  


“Do you think she was with the guy?” she asked me, “Do you think she came with him and got cold feet?” I bit my bottom lip and gently shook my head. “At first, yeah, I thought *exactly* that, but after the police left…I don’t know…you’re probably gonna find this one of the most insane things I’ve ever said, but…” I took the biggest breath of all before finishing, “I think it came from the woman in that photograph I brought home” Now came the longest pause of all. I reached out and picked up my drink again, knocking back the rest before looking over at her. I’d figured I’d see a concerned look there. I was surprised to see a thoughtful expression instead. “What’re you thinking?” I asked. She stayed quiet a moment more, then answered. “Honestly, Jamie, I actually *don’t* find that, that far-fetched” She tapped her fingers against my arm.  


“You wanna know one of the reasons why I can’t help but find many of the pictures you collect in your gallery so eerie?” she asked. I nodded. “I find them creepy as hell because of something I was told when I was little. My father took my mother and me on trips to South America when I was a kid, mostly to watch him work. He would go to take pictures of the areas down there for magazines. But he would always ask permission from the tribes before taking their photo” She took a sip of her drink. “He told me that this was because many of them believed that cameras didn’t capture only moments in time. Many tribes, and, indeed, many places around the world, believe that when a camera captures a person’s image, it also captures either a piece of their soul, or all of it. That it’s frozen in the developed picture for all of eternity. And, as much as I tried to tell myself that it was simply superstition, part of me always wondered if there was any truth to it”  


She locked eyes with me then before finishing. “So, I don’t think what you think is completely insane. Although, part of me almost hopes it was just an accomplice, because…the alternative almost seems *worse*” For a time, we simply sat in silence, staring at the fire before getting ready for bed. As I took our glasses into the kitchen, a shiver shot up my spine. I froze, slowly turning my head to look at the basement door almost directly to my right. It was firmly locked by now, the key having been taken out and hung on the hook next to it. My eyes flickered on the keyhole. For a moment, I had a strange impulse to kneel down and look into it. And I couldn’t help but feel that, if I did, I’d see an eye peering out at me from the other side. The fear I’d had in the dark basement returned, and another shiver rolled up my spine. I turned away, dropping the glasses in the sink before quickly walking out of the room. Addy’s words had had more than a little of an effect on me. And they’d managed to stir up a thought. One that didn’t involve the woman, but the glaring man in the other picture. *What if…just maybe…* I shook my head and climbed the stairs. “Don’t be stupid, Jamie” I muttered.   


But as I lay in bed waiting for sleep to take me, I couldn’t completely banish the idea away. And when I fell asleep, it was to horrible nightmares. Nightmares of the man climbing out of the picture, a wicked smile spread across his face and bloodlust in his eyes.  


Sunday was a slow day, albeit a bit dreary one. Ominous looking dark clouds had moved in; the first traces of a storm on the horizon. The reporter on the the TV said that we’d be facing thunderstorms tonight, with the possibility of power outages in our area. Because of this, Addy took the Suburban into town to fill up a few gas cans to power the generator if it came to that and pick up some extra supplies, leaving me alone in the house again. Part of me felt wary about staying by myself, but I still needed to finish cleaning the photos before tomorrow’s unveiling. However, I wasn’t going to stay in the basement, so I elected to clean them in my home office on the ground floor. I brought them up one at a time, starting with the woman. As I set it down, the warm, entrancing feel I’d had looking at it earlier fell over me again. This time, I didn’t feel apprehensive about it. I remembered Addy’s words and smiled at her, drinking in her beauty.   


The same twinge of guilt I’d felt yesterday reared its head for a moment as I let my gaze wander over her figure, but it disappeared just as quickly. I let out a sigh of content. *God, she is so stunning*. The smile dropped from my face as I realized I’d left the cleaning rag hanging over the sink faucet. “Damn it” I whispered, turning to go get it. But I stopped, turning back to look at the picture. I debated for a moment before looking directly into her eyes. “Thank you” I said softly, my voice barely above a whisper. “For yesterday” Nothing disturbed the silence, but I thought I felt the air in the room grow lighter. Smiling, I turned and went into the kitchen, retrieving the rag. As I walked back down the long hallway, however, a familiar aroma reached my nostrils. *The perfume I smelled yesterday*. I walked quickly into the room, a strange, ridiculous hope that I’d find her out of the picture, sitting in my cleaning chair waiting for me. But everything still looked the same. A small wave of disappointment fell over me, but I shook it away, reaching out and tapping the iPod in its dock.   


I worked diligently for the next two hours, rock and classical music spilling out from the speakers as I cleaned the glass and frame. By the time the clock displayed it was *4:30*, I had removed every single streak in the glass and brought the copper frame back to its shiny original state. I took a step back and admired my handiwork. *Not bad, if I do say so, myself*, I thought. As I got ready to bring the picture back downstairs, the phone began ringing. I pulled the handset from its cradle, seeing Addy’s cell number displayed on the Caller ID. A wave of shame for making eyes at the woman’s picture fell over me, and I spared a quick glance at her smile before turning my back to it and answering. “Hello?” Addy’s voice came from the other end of the line. “Hey, everything going alright back there?” “Yeah, everything’s quiet here, just trying to finish up the work on these two pictures before tomorrow” I said, reaching out and shutting the music off.  


“Well, I got the gas; you wouldn’t believe the line at the pumps for it. People are saying the power is *definitely* going to go out tonight, so glad you said to get it. I’m about to head in and grab some food and other supplies from Wal-Mart now, so I should be home in about an hour to an hour and a half” The smell of perfume seemed to intensify in the room, and I felt myself relax into the chair. Addy said something else, but it sounded far away, as though she were speaking through a wall. A sudden chill rolled up my spine as I swear I felt the same sensation of fingers tracing along the back of my neck, along with the soft, warm feeling of being breathed on. I spun around in my seat, half expecting to find a pair of eyes and smile right in my face. Nothing was there. The woman still smiled from the photo. But something seemed to have changed. I leaned forward, squinting. *Wait a minute…I swear her eyes were looking more to the right. Or...were they always looking more in the direction I’m sitting?*  


“Jamie!”  


The yelling voice emanating from the phone in my hand snapped me out of my stupor, and I pressed it to my ear again. “Yeah, I’m here” I said quickly. For a moment, there was silence on the line before she spoke. “Are you okay, babe? You sound…I don’t know, distracted or something” I ran a hand over my face, rubbing my eyes and sighing. “Yeah, I think so” I finally answered, “I think what happened yesterday is still under my skin a bit, and I’m just off, if that makes sense” I heard her sigh on the other end of the line as well. “Yeah, I’ve felt the same way. I’ve actually been thinking. After you debut those photos tomorrow, you wanna take a vacation for a week, just to unwind from that? I was thinking about having us drive down to Bodega Bay. You always said you wanted to visit the filming locations from The Birds, after all” For a moment, I thought. Part of me still felt entranced by the sensation I’d now felt twice. But I shook my head. “Honestly, a vacation sounds freakin’ perfect. We’ll figure it out when you get home, okay?” She agreed, and after a quick “I love you”, hung up.  


I replaced the phone in its cradle, looking out the window facing the ocean. The clouds loomed almost directly over the house. *Storm’s almost here*. Then I turned back to the picture. My head still felt a little fuzzy, and I struggled to place what the two identical sensations had felt like. *It…it almost feels like I was trying to be seduced*. Shaking my head, I picked up the picture and brought it back downstairs. I eyed the other picture, still covered with the drop cloth. A part of me didn’t even want to touch the thing. “There’s no way out of it, you’ve got to get it cleaned before tomorrow” I said to myself. However, I kept it covered, picking the whole thing up and carrying it upstairs. Setting it down on the easel, I took a deep breath before pulling the cloth off. Immediately, I felt myself tense up. “Um, *what*?” I breathed out. I leaned forward, blinking my eyes to make sure I wasn’t seeing things.  


I wasn’t.  


When I’d last looked at the picture of the man, he’d been standing in a confident pose, his eyes glaring towards the top left corner of the photo, his striped suit buttoned up and looking like a million bucks. Now, though, the picture had changed. The suit was no longer buttoned up. It had been undone, revealing the vest he wore underneath. It also revealed something else. I felt a chill shoot up my spine as I saw the knife sheathed on his hip. From the current angle, I couldn’t tell its exact size, but it looked lethal enough. That wasn’t the part that made my breathing suddenly quicken. Part of me wished I was wrong, that I was imagining things. But his eyes had changed. They were now staring straight out of the photo. Directly at *me*. “*Fucking hell*” I managed out, standing up and backing away from the picture. My mind raced as I tried to comprehend. Dots connected; I knew now that I hadn’t been crazy, I had seen the woman’s eyes in a different position before. *This…this is…oh, you gotta be kidding me. BOTH of them can move in their pictures?! How in the hell is this even possible? I know Addy spoke about pictures capturing people’s souls, but how could they move in them? No other photos I’ve ever dealt with have done this. What kind of power does it take to make this possible?*   


Then my mind stopped. My breathing began to come in short, ragged gasps as I attempted to push away the thought worming its way to the forefront of my mind. But try as hard as I might to divert it, it still came forward. And the single question filled with as much terror and fear as I’d felt yesterday. *Can they climb out of the pictures…?* My mind flashed back to the black basement. “That…that was an intruder last night, *right*?” I asked myself out loud, my voice wavering slightly. Nobody answered thankfully, but the mental images burning themselves into my head were elevating the fear surging through me. Images of the man climbing out of the photo in the dark, grinning evilly as he crept towards me. *Oh, hell no*. As I stared at the picture, a thought suddenly occurred to me. “Justin!” Justin was one of my oldest friends, someone who I’d known since I was little. A goofball like myself, we always got into trouble until we were young adults. I also remembered that his mother was more than a little into things like the occult. If anybody would know anything about things of this nature, it’d be her.   


I snatched my cell phone off the desk next to me, making sure to keep an eye on the glowering figure in the picture as I turned on the screen. The first thing I saw was another email notification from eBay, the second one I’d seen since yesterday. Flicking it away, I opened the messenger app and began typing a text to my friend. *Hey dude, this may sound like a weird request coming from me, but could you ask your mother something? Could you ask her about pictures? Specifically about people who can move in pictures, or even crawl out of them?* I put the phone in my lap and kept my eyes trained on the man. Every fiber of my being was telling me to get out of the room now; screaming, actually. My phone vibrated, and I let out a relieved sigh as I snatched it up. *Never expected that from you dude, especially where you never believed in that sort of thing. Any reason why you’re asking? Hope you and Addy are battened down for the storm coming, it’s about to be a doozy*. Almost as if his text had summoned it, I heard the rumble of thunder come from outside, signaling the storm was minutes away. I typed back quickly. *As nuts as it may seem, I may be dealing with something like it... Just please ask, and quickly*.  


I put the phone down again and stared at the picture. As I did, the fear remained. But, something else began to well up inside of me. A feeling I hadn’t felt as strongly since my school days. Anger. When I’d been a young teenager, I’d often end up bullied by the older kids for so many damn things. For wearing glasses. For being into reading books. For liking history. I’d be picked on, beaten the shit out of and threatened by them. The fear I felt from the picture brought back the horrible memories of being cornered in the gym locker room, and as much as I knew it was a massively different situation, it still felt the same. The man in the picture felt like a much worse version of those bullies. And one thing I grew to hate feeling, was afraid. Rage now began to boil in my blood, and I turned to glare back at the picture. Spittle began to fly from my mouth as I spoke to the photo.  


“You know what? I really don’t know if I’m fucking nuts or not, but just on the off chance I’m not, and you can actually move in there and hear me, if you were the one who attacked me last night. *Fuck you*, buddy. Yeah, you heard me right. Fuck you! And you know what else? I’m not fucking afraid of your goon, mafia ass. You’re nothing more than a piece of shit. And you’re fucking long dead too, let’s not forget that one” I drew in a deep breath, righteous anger spilling out of me. A thought suddenly swam forward in my head as I remembered seeing the email notification, and my lips curled into an angry, vengeful smile. “And you know what, to top it off? I’m not keeping you. Tomorrow, I’m gonna try and return you to the person I bought you from. I’m only gonna keep the woman’s picture. And if they won’t take you back, you know where you’re going? Straight into the fucking dump. So put that in your fucking pipe and smoke it, asshole!”  


Vaguely, I felt the phone vibrate in my lap again. But I wasn’t paying attention. I kept grinning at the picture, now feeling like I had the upper hand. Deciding I didn’t want to be in the room anymore, I stood up, flipping the man the bird before turning and striding towards the open door. I was halfway through the doorway when it came.  


*WHAM!*  


I can still perfectly remember that sound. The sound of something slamming into the wall, almost directly next to my head. I froze in mid-stride, all of the righteous, vengeful anger I’d been feeling suddenly dropping out of my body like it was a sieve. The fear which had dulled returned in spades, and I felt chill after chill run up my spine, as if I were being doused in ice water. Slowly, I turned my head to the right. My eyes suddenly went wide as they found the source of the noise. I gasped, suddenly moving rapidly backwards to slam into the side of the doorway. My heart began to thunder in my chest, and I felt my blood turn to ice.  


Embedded in the doorframe, less than a foot from where my head had been, was perhaps the most sinister knife I’d ever seen in my life. The solid silver blade glinted wickedly in the overhead lights, and the obsidian black handle vibrated back and forth from the force of the throw. Realization suddenly crashed into me like a truck as I recognized where I’d seen that handle. Swallowing hard, I slowly turned to look back into the room, at the picture.  


If I hadn’t felt breathless, I probably would’ve screamed.  


The picture had changed again. The sheath the knife had been set in now sat on the man’s waist, empty and unsnapped. The right hand was clenched into a fist, the veins on the hand looking like they were bulging out. But the worst part was his face. The regular glare that had always been there was gone. Now, his face held an expression of absolute murderous rage on it. The eyes smoldered, looking black as coal now. I managed to whimper out three words. “*Fuck me, man*” It might’ve been a trick of the light, but I swear I saw a corner of the man’s mouth curl up ever so slightly into a smirk at my words. I didn’t wait to see any longer. I snatched for the door handle, yanking the door closed as hard as I could. I snatched for the key that hung from a nail on the wall, jamming it into the lock and turning it. As soon as I was certain it was locked, I turned and walked quickly down the hallway. Coming around the corner into the kitchen, I fought to catch my breath. *What the actual FUCK just happened in there?!*  


I knew immediately that I couldn’t keep that photo in the house any longer. I wasn’t completely sure if the man could actually come out of the picture, or just interact with the world like he just had. I wasn’t sure if they could be seen moving, or worked on some Doctor Who Weeping Angels-type shit. Either way, that picture couldn’t even stay the rest of the night in the house. It needed to get taken and dumped tonight. *Soon as Addy comes back with the Suburban, I’m going to help her unload the stuff, and then I’m going to cover the picture up again and stuff it face down in the back. I’ll tie it down and drive, not to the dump, but to the damn ocean. I’m throwing it into the churning sea and letting it sink into the* *fucking abyss. I’ve seen too many horror movies to wait. Fuck this shit, dude*.  


Light suddenly blazed through the kitchen window, rolling across the kitchen from right to left. My eyes flew up, and I felt a surge of joy and hope flow through me as I saw the truck pull up in front of the garage. “Not a freakin’ moment too soon” I muttered, then ran for the side door. As I sped past the basement door, for a moment, I thought I heard something come from behind it. A woman’s voice. But I didn’t stop to listen. I tore open the door, banging open the screen door and jogging for the truck. Lightning flashed, suddenly turning the world from night to day for a moment, and the wind whipped fiercely around me. Addy leapt out of the truck, slamming the driver’s door and turning to give me a smile. “Just in time, I need help getting all this inside!” I forced a smile back, not allowing her to see how freaked out I really was. “Sounds like a plan! Why don’t you take the supplies into the house, and I’ll take the gas into the garage to the generator?” She nodded and began to turn away when I touched her arm.   


“By the way, after we get this unloaded, I’m taking the truck for a few minutes!” Confusion spread across her face. “Where’re you going?” she asked, having to raise her voice as another rumble of thunder came. “Just to quickly take care of something, I’ll tell you later!” I half yelled back. The perplexed look remained on her face, but she nodded and walked to the back of the truck. Swinging open the rear barn doors, she grabbed the two bags of food and supplies and headed for the open kitchen door. As soon as she did, I grabbed the first two of four cans of gas and walked them into the garage, setting them down next to the large, hulking shape of the generator. As I began walking back to the truck, my cell phone began to frantically vibrate. Reaching into my pocket, I pulled it out and looked at the screen. Surprise filled me as I saw Justin’s name displayed. *I didn’t think he’d call me, just text me*. Shrugging to myself, I tapped the accept button and put the phone to my ear.  


“Hey, man, I didn’t think you’d ring me up!” I said, walking to the truck and opening the driver’s door. The wind was too loud now to hear him speak, but sitting in the truck would dull the sound enough. Hauling myself inside, I slammed the door shut and leaned back in the seat. “Did you hear me, man?” I heard him ask. An odd feeling came over me at his tone. *Why the hell does he sound so panicked?* “No, I was out in the wind, what’d you say?” I said. “I said, please, for the love of *God*, tell me you were joking about dealing with the whole people moving in their pictures-thing!” Now I *definitely* knew something was wrong. His tone was dead serious and he’d almost pleaded the last sentence. Dread began to form a pit in my stomach. “Justin, what the hell is it man?” I demanded. He answered before my sentence was even finished. “I just got done speaking with Mom, and she almost flipped when I told her you’d said something about it. She got white as a sheet and almost fainted!”  


A shiver ran up my spine. “What the hell did she *say*?!” I almost yelled into the phone. The words that replied chilled me to the bone. “Mom said she’s only heard rumors about things like that. She told me that it takes a metric fuck-ton of black magic to pull something like that off. It basically means either willingly splintering a piece of your soul from your body, or cursing someone to be bound to a picture forever as torture. You don’t age, you don’t die, and you can hear and see everything around you. But you cannot get away from the picture. The only way to break that curse is to destroy the picture and frame it’s in, itself”  


I felt my blood chill in my veins. *Oh, shit…* I forced myself to not panic, keeping my mind thinking as slow as I could. “Can they interact with people and things outside of their pictures?” I asked, trying to will my voice to remain calm. “Yes”, Justin answered, “Mom said they can physically interact with the world around the picture. It’s just that they don’t like showing themselves unless they want to. Or they’re trying for something” My eyes grew wide. “What would they be trying for?” I heard a deep breath on the other end of the line. “Jamie, think, man. People in old photographs are usually long dead, right? What do you think they want? They want life. But the way the spell works, unless you have an extremely powerful witch or warlock, and pray if you meet one of them that they like you, is that you have to make a trade. Someone gets stuck forever in the picture, and you can leave, living the remaining years they would have” I gasped. “You mean they possess you or something?” “No” he answered, “They don’t get your body; it’s not like body swapping. They come out looking exactly like they did in the picture, and you get trapped in it!”  


My mind was now picking up speed, putting the dots together. *The woman…trapped unwillingly. That’s why she’s been trying to help me. And him…he willingly split his soul to live forever. And now…he wants out*. A final question bubbled forward, the one I’d thought of earlier, but had been too afraid to wonder. Now, I forced myself to ask it. “Justin…I need to ask you one final question” Silence came from his end of the line as he waited for me to speak. I forced a shaking breath out. “Can they climb out of the pictures they’re in?” For a few seconds, there was silence, and then he answered, uttering only a single word.  


“Yes”  


Horror like I’d never felt in my life smashed into me with the one word. I knew for sure now that there had been no burglar in my basement yesterday. It had been something much, *much* worse. And if it hadn’t been for the woman warning me, I’d be trapped in that picture in the basement right now. I’d have been trapped down there when Addy….  


*ADDY!*  


My heart almost stopped as I realized that my girlfriend was alone in the house right now. It didn’t matter that the door to my office was locked; she was in the house with that thing alone. “Justin, I gotta go, man!” I said quickly, then ended the call before he could say anything. Pushing open the driver’s door against the now howling wind, I leapt out and began running for the door, wishing for the first time in my life that we weren’t so far from the nearest neighbors. “Addy!” I shouted as I charged for the door into the kitchen. No one answered me, and I took the steps to the screen door two at a time, ripping it open and shoving the kitchen door open. As I flew inside, I froze as a sound suddenly reached my ears.  


Screaming.  


“*ADDY*!” I screamed, sprinting through the kitchen into the living room. Leaping over the couch, I skidded into the hallway to my office, slamming my shoulder into the wall. At the end of the hall, I saw a crumpled figure and ran to it as fast as I could. As I drew closer, I saw it was Addy. And, to my relief, she was alive. I dropped to my knees next to her, about to ask her if she was okay. But the look on her face closed my throat up. Her face had gone as white as a sheet, and her eyes, seeming almost delirious with fear, were wide. But they weren’t looking at me. They were looking *past* me. A chill shot up my spine, and slowly, I turned to look behind me.  


What I saw will stay with me forever. I’ve had nothing but nightmares since that night, seeing the same horrifying, sanity-tearing image. And I’ll likely have them the rest of my life.  
The door to my office had been unlocked and opened. By Addy or…something *else*, I’ll never know. But I had a clear view straight into the room. Straight to the picture.  


*Dead people aren’t supposed to be able to crawl out of pictures. They’re not supposed to be able to climb out of them*. That’s what my mind repeated to itself over and over. The glaring man in the picture was decades dead, if not closer to a half a century. And he had pulled himself halfway out of the picture. Thick, meaty hands gripped the frame for purchase as he attempted to pull himself out completely. The fedora he’d been wearing had fallen to the floor of my office, laying face up. Slicked back black hair covered his head. The brown, almost black eyes glared out at us, at *me*. The mouth was curled into a cruel smirk as he watched me start to tug on Addy, trying to drag her away.  


And then he spoke, his voice deep and low.  


“Hello Jamie”
