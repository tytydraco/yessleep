When I was a kid, my mother told me stories every night. As I lay snug and warm, she would regale me with tales of spirits who wander the forests of Bar Island. There were small ones which she called "Fork Flyers", and larger ones known as the "Sledgestones", but the biggest of them all was Yorut. He was a massive turtle with a head and face like that of a snail. Seven large horns formed a mane around his neck, preventing him from ever withdrawing into his shell. My mother would tell me that this is what led him to become the protector of the other spirits. Because Yorut could never withdraw, his only option when threatened was to fight to the end. She would weave fantastical tales of the twenty foot tall beast batting away bulldozers, and leering at corporate lawyers in a threatening manner.  I had figured out by the age of 12 that most of my mother's stories were just that, stories. She had spent her college years among the environmentalists, and that was very much reflected in the tall tales she created. I guess I had inherited a bit of that drive from her, as I elected to join the Forestry Service. It was during my career there that I learned that Yorut was very real.


Tuesday, February 9th, 1994 


It started as a day like any other, and quickly took a turn for the bizarre. I stopped in at Henry's coffee shop as I did every morning. Henry and I exchanged our usual pleasantries and he set right to work preparing my drink. By the time he turned back around to hand it to me there had been a dramatic shift in demeanor. Henry had always been amicable, even friendly, but this was different. His eyes were as wide as dinner plates. His usually charming smile was just a bit more rigid than usual. It looked as if making my coffee had electrified Henry with happiness. 


"Uh, hey man are you okay?" I asked

"Oh you betcha, I just feel so good all of a sudden it's impossible not to smile." Henry replied, beginning to rub his own face as if his skin were velvet. 

"Well let's hope you put some of that sunshine into my drink" I laughed and asked Henry how much I owed him. 

"It's on the house!" Henry shouted, before adding "IN FACT, FREE COFFEE FOR EVERYONE" 


Henry's grand showing of goodwill had brought light into the hearts of everybody there. It's amazing sometimes how something so small can make people so happy. I was even more amazed to see the ripple effect it had caused. As I drove out of the town on my way to work, I passed John's used car lot where he was putting up crudely made cardboard signs which read "Zero money down? Zero money EVER!" People were filing out of the local Walmart with cart after cart full of unpurchased goods. Everybody involved, be they customer or staff, was grinning from ear to ear. I heard people on the streets shouting greetings to one another. I watched the town mayor, Jonah Newport, climb into a car with a perfect stranger just because he had asked. For all intents and purposes it appeared to be a new revolution of love and brotherhood unfolding before my eyes. The reality of the situation was much more... complex. 


After the chaotic charity and fraternity of the morning I was excited to get out into the forest and enjoy the stillness of nature. I spent most of the day walking the trails checking for litter and signs of wildlife. By the time I had nearly finished my rounds the sun had begun to sink in the western sky. If it weren't for the encroaching darkness of the evening I may never have seen the streaks of glowing purple light darting around the trees. As I approached the area where I had seen them, I began to hear noises. Wet, popping thumps followed by small screeches. The sound of rock striking against rock, each time accompanied by a breathy "kuh". Another twenty feet and I could see the purple streaks a little bit better. Leathery wings held their slight frames aloft, bodies no more than two inches across at their widest, with long drifting tails which ended in a two-pronged pitchfork. My eyes widened as the implications of what I was seeing began to dawn on me. "Flying Forks" I thought "no, wait. It was 'Fork Flyers'." 


Creatures straight from my bedtime stories now danced before me, each taking its place in a great ring which made its orbit around some unseen object. I was rooted in place as I watched their silent parade. I noticed after a time that not all of the Fork Flyers were glowing with that unearthly shade of purple. The ones who had lost their shine peeled off from the rest and flew inward. In the stories my mother had told me, Fork Flyers were never mean, unless they were hungry. That little tidbit is what drove me to make the unfathomably stupid decision to try and slip past the ring. I waited, taking care to identify a portion of the ring where the Flyers glowed brightest. I surmised that the brightest of them might have been the most satiated, so I counted the seconds it took for my group to come around, and when it did I ran like hell. 


Diving under the ring of Flyers I scrambled to my feet and ran for cover as fast as I could. The foolishness of my decision loomed over me, growing in size with each passing second, until I had made it far enough to feel safe hiding once more. I moved between the trees, ears alert for any sign of hungry Forks flying my way. When I finally saw him I was stunned. It was Yorut. He was everything the stories said he was. Easily 40 feet from head to tail. His seven horns protruded high into the sky. Each leg a mighty trunk like that of a Redwood. He was magnificent. He was awe-inspiring, and he was dead. The Fork Flyers covered every inch of exposed flesh. Hundreds upon hundreds of pitchforks stabbing into Yorut's increasingly mangled body. More stood in wait, perched along each of the seven horns which crowned his head. As they fed, the tails of the flyers began pulsing with a faint light which suffused their bodies. My earlier suspicions were confirmed when a flyer, the most luminous of his cohort, flew away to rejoin the great ring. 


I could see groups of blue humanoid figures sitting in tightly knit circles. Each one had a large, rough patch on their forehead. They took turns bashing these patches against Yorut's shell, attempting to break it open. When their efforts were successful the peaceful, cooperative circles turned into violent feeding frenzies. Elbows flew with wild abandon as each of the Sledgestones fought to rip away chunks of the Grand turtle's flesh. Unlike the Fork Flyers, the Sledgestones did not seem to ever reach satiety. 


I was so engrossed in watching the beasts of my imagination devouring the hero of all my favorite stories that I had failed to hear the sound of leathery wings slipping through the night air. The Fork Flyer must have been making its way to Yorut when it spotted me and decided I might be easy prey. As it approached me the Flyer's tail stretched impossibly far, impossibly fast. The twin prongs of its tail planted themselves on both sides of my neck, narrowly missing a fatal blow. The prongs atop its head were the next to come. Another miss, with the creature's vicious face held mere inches away from me by its own tools. Teeth lined its oval mouth, gnashing and screeching in its struggle to reach me. I would love to say I took action.  That I dislodged the creature's tail to make my escape, but I didn't. I didn't even scream. I just stared at the Flyer as it snapped and screeched at me, knowing I was trapped. 


A streak of blue obliterated the winged devil before colliding with a tree in its path. The Flyer had been destroyed, but the tail remained lodged in the tree holding me still. Its severed head continued to gnaw uselessly at the distance between us. A Sledgestone, late to the party, had arrived just in time to save my life. It got up, shaking the concussion out of its head, and locked its eyes on mine. The blue giant was easily 9 feet tall. It was covered in hair, like the fur of an animal, and it was beginning its charge. I moved as much as I could manage, only just avoiding my right leg being turned to paste. The vibrations from the impact loosened the Flyer's abandoned extremities. I pushed with all the strength of desperation and I was made free, but not yet safe. The Sledgestone was recovering quickly. I ran like hell through the forest, all the while made aware of my pursuer by the thunderous slam of its skull against tree after tree. I drove straight home and didn't come out of my bedroom for two days. 


Tuesday February 10th


I had thought that isolation would be good. That it would help me sort out my thoughts, but in reality I was only spinning in circles. I had a long list of questions to answer and I had gotten stumped by the very first: How was any of this real? These were supposed to be nothing more than legends that teach kids lessons. Like the legend of Yehankaru, a shapeshifter who would lurk in the shadows of prosperous civilizations, stealing away anyone who allowed it to lure them to a secluded area. Easily the most heavy-handed metaphor for "stranger danger" I had ever seen. 


Wednesday, February 11th


I made my way into town for a coffee and a bit of normalcy. As he made my drink for me, I noticed that Henry's lunatic grin now needed to be frequently reapplied. Whatever ecstasy had overcome the town seemed to be fading. The signs at John's now half-empty car lot had been changed to say "TWO DOLLARS DOWN?! Get outta town!" The employees of the depleted Walmart shrugged at customers perusing barren shelves. The same vehicle that had picked up the mayor was now offering Harvey Potler a steak dinner if he got in the car. Harvey accepted the offer in the end. On the surface it was all still friendly, but the cracks were beginning to show. 


I arrived at the Ranger's station to find my superior, Terrence Howard (not that one), with his head in his hands. People had been going missing along trails in record numbers, and not just near our station. All across the island, men and women were failing to return from things as mundane as trips to the grocery store. I tried to tell him what I had seen in the woods, but I couldn't find the words. In the end, I only irritated him further with my stammering.


"Damn it, Brantley, either spit it out or get the hell out of my office. I don't have time to play charades when half the fucking town is missing." He glared at me as he spat out the words. I couldn't find a way to explain without landing myself in a straitjacket. I thought maybe it would be easier if I showed him. 

"Will you come with me?" I asked timidly, "I can't find the words." 

Terrence Howard's expression softened. Terrence was a good man, albeit a good man under an extreme amount of stress. He sighed. "Fine," He said "but we need to be back before noon." 


We stared at the churning festival of consumption for what felt like days. The Flyers continued their skewering of the great beast. Sledgestones crowded in larger groups as the available real estate on Yorut's back dwindled. New species of creature had turned up to the feast. A face set in a flat area about the size of a beach ball with five appendages reaching toward the sky. They resembled human hands sprouting from the ground. Using their "fingers" to climb, they made their way to one of the Sledgestones' abandoned portholes before setting their rat-like faces down in the entryway. Wolves the size of moose stalked around the corpse, slipping in to tear away chunks of destroyed flesh before retreating to their pack. Their jet black fur danced with greens and blues as they ran. It was one forty five when Terrence turned to me and asked the question that had been burning in my mind since I found Yorut. 


 "What the fuck?" 

"...Yeah..." was all I could offer. 

"Why didn't you say anything when you found it?" Terrence asked. 

"Respectfully, sir, I had no idea how to explain this." I replied. 

"That's...fair..." he said. "What the hell are we supposed to do about this, Brantley?" 


I was relieved beyond measure to hear that. "We." If I were going to be grappling with the impossible, at least I wouldn't be doing it alone. Easy come easy go, I guess. 


We were halfway back to the station, walking together in stunned silence, when we first saw them. Dark shadows in the depths of the forest. Terrence must have noticed them first. He spoke quietly. 

"Keep your eyes trained forward and do not slow down. I don't know what they'll do if they know that we're aware of them. It's just a quarter mile to the station now." 


The small sign signifying the first set of guest restrooms verified his words. I did as I was told. Never letting my attention wander too close to the many lights of unblinking eyes. Through my peripherals I could see that not every figure was whole. Some only had a single glowing ember set deep into the skull. Others had tiny twin stars blazing in their ocular cavities. The figures were of different sizes. Some big, some small. Some thin, some more rotund. Their unified gaze followed us all the while. Quiet. Patient. Hunters waiting for a chance to strike. 


We reached the station after fifteen minutes which each felt like seven. The feeling of elation from safely completing our journey hit me like a truck. I felt that as long as we could reach the station, everything would be alright. It wasn't until we had shut the door behind us that I remembered what we were doing. Noting had changed. We had made no progress. We were only seeking a shelter from which to wonder about what the hell was happening. We were every bit as lost as when we had set out. We sat together in total silence for an hour or two. 

"My mother used to tell me about these things." I said. "In stories when I was a kid. I never thought any of it was real. Half of the time she would make Yorut, that's the dead guy, into a pseudo-Captain Planet figure." I continued, "the ones with points at each end are called Fork Flyers. She called the blue ones 'Sledgestones'. She never mentioned the wolves or the hands." 

"Perhaps it's related to some old folklore. Your mother had to get these stories from somewhere, right?" Terrence Howard posited. 

I had been thinking much the same. I was ready to look up information on the town's legends when Terrence told me there was no need. 

"I keep a book of old tales in my truck." And his face fell as if he were ashamed to say, "I...I use the stories to scare hikers sometimes." 


I laughed at the admission, as Terrence walked outside to retrieve the book. The mistake was revealed to me immediately. Terrence had been gone for just under a minute when the silence of the night was suddenly broke by the sound of a hundred footfalls. In the middle of the cacophony I could hear a single voice crying out. 


"Waitwaitwait NO. Brantley! Help...help...help" the voice of my only companion in this crisis faded meekly into the distance, drowned out by the whooping cries of his captors. 


Thursday, February 12th 


I filed a missing persons report. The clerk told me that Terrence would mark the 237th person to disappear. She informed me of this with an air that said "don't get your hopes up". I should have taken that bit of unspoken advice. 


The air in Henry's coffee shop seemed different today. He, along with his customers, had all adopted a slight scowl. The overall mood felt...melancholic. Henry grumbled at my coffee as he poured it, and gave it to me with his other hand outstretched. 


"What, no more free coffee?" I asked, unserious. 

"PLEASE. Just stop. I'm not in the mood for this kind of crap today." He bristled all over as I noticed the empty glass cases which usually held a variety of food items. "The city says I didn't have the proper permits for giving away coffee. If you ask me, they've got it out for me." 

"Oh geez, I'm sorry to hear that." I replied. I meant it, Henry had always been kind. The town had come to view him as a staple. After all, what is the linchpin of society if not the local coffee shop? I put a five dollar bill in the tip jar and went on my way. 

John's signs had changed once again. This time, they read: "I like money too, yknow!" I could see John through the window to his office. He seemed to be hard at work crafting tomorrow's message. Elizabeth Stoltz, an older woman with a fiery temper, was in a one-sided shouting match with the vehicle which had been collecting townsfolk. 

"How dare you proposition me, sir? I am a lady. I will not be getting into a car full of strange me-" her sentence cut off as a wiry arm reached out in a flash and dragged her into the vehicle through the window. I tried to catch the car's license plate number, but the letters appeared to be shifting constantly. If anybody else on the street had noticed, they didn't give any indication. I decided I would go and try to retrieve the book Terrence had mentioned. The journey was largely uneventful. Once or twice during the drive I caught sight of people hiding (poorly) behind trees. You know that thing kids do where they hide behind something that barely obscures your vision of them? It was like that. 


The book was not worth the uneventful drive. Aside from a passing mention of Yorut, I found absolutely nothing. No Fork Flyers, no Sledgestones, nada. If my mother were still with us I could ask her directly where her old stories came from. In that moment, I missed her more than usual. I sat back, drinking in the silence of the Ranger's station, thinking of the woman who had raised me. 


Bereft of answers. Still. I found myself curious about the state of Yorut. After what had happened to Terrence, I was taking no chances. I fired up the drone we use to scout for missing hikers and sent it on its way. 


Shards of shell littered the clearing. Every inch of ground not covered by the fragments lay soaked in a viscous purple fluid. The Fork Flyers had disappeared from the immediate area,  seemingly all moving to the great ring which still made its orbit around the corpse of Yorut. The Sledgestones were standing in a massive huddle, desperately beating back the titanic wolves which had appeared. The hands had grown additional appendages which slithered their way across the bloodied ground looking to grab up anything it found. One of the hands, which had used its newfound tentacle to snatch up a Sledgestone, was pierced from within by a coalition of crimson worms. Their slender bodies tapered into points that looked sharp enough to pierce Kevlar. I turned the drone around to bring it home, only for it to be chased down and knocked out of the sky by a curious Fork. 


It seemed to me that the feast was reaching its end. There wasn't enough of Yorut left to sustain the creatures, and they had begun to turn on one another. Perhaps this problem would solve itself. If I could just wait a few days, the corpse would be fully depleted and all this craziness might finally end. 

So of course, shit hit the fan the next day. 


Friday, February 13th 


Bedlam had come to town. Henry stood outside of his coffee shop yelling at passersby. 


"MY BUSINESS IS FAILING BECAUSE YOU GREEDY FUCKS DON'T PAY FOR YOUR COFFEE" he raged, stopping himself for a moment to say hello to me, before launching further into his tirade. I stopped in at the police station to check for any sign of Terrence, and I found more than I had bargained for. Two hundred and fifty missing persons had all shown up to the station that morning, and among them were Harvey Potler, and Terrence. I was elated. 

"TERRENCE" I shouted, causing him to stumble slightly in surprise. "I'm so glad you're okay, what the hell happened?"


"Huh?" Was his initial reply, hastily adding "Oh, that. Yeah I got loose about an hour after they took me. Ran all night. Thank goodness I found a trail. I could have died out there, Brantley." 


"Dude, I know!" I finally took a good look at him. Terrence looked like shit. His clothes hung loosely off his body. Occasionally a rib would show through the shirt as he moved. He was emaciated, as if he had been starving for days when no more than 36 hours had passed. In fact, all of the returning vanished looked brutally thin. I brushed it off, making a mental note to get this man a cheeseburger ASAP. 


As we drove aimlessly through town, the relationship between Terrence and I was flipped on its head. Usually I'm the one making impractical suggestions to irritate Terrence. Today, apparently, it was his turn. 


"Maybe we should go scope out the corpse again" he said. 


"I don't see much point in that." I replied. The scene had remained, at its core, largely the same since I had discovered it. With the feast tapering off, I didn't know what information we could possibly glean from another look. Terrence, to his credit, dropped that particular suggestion. However, it was immediately followed up with another. 


"Well, there's all these old sewer tunnels. Maybe there's something to investigate down there." He sounded desperate. I understood exactly how that felt. I just wanted an answer. I would have gone down into those sewers, had I seen anything at all to suggest they held clues for us. 


"The sewers? Are you feeling okay, man?" I was worried about my friend/boss. He had been abducted by creatures of the forest. Who knows what that's like, other than him? I could forgive him for being in a bit of a fog. 


"Yeah, I'm totally fine I just think we should go somewhere that nobody else goes. If there was something to see where people go, then somebody would have seen it. We should be checking the areas where there are no other peo-" his words were cut off by the shattering of the passenger side rear window. John stood at the edge of his empty lot, shotgun in hand. He had a look on his face of bewildered animalistic rage. He racked another shell and took aim once more. The pellets punched dozens of tiny holes in the passenger side door. They tore around Terrence's legs, some even leaving holes in his pants. Miraculously, he was unharmed. I sped away as fast as the vehicle would allow. 


Everywhere we went, there was chaos. Walmart was completely engulfed in flames. People shouted obscenities at one another. Fights to the death were breaking out over every minor disagreement. Terrence and I had been watching Jane Turnbull giving Gabe Trund a beatdown over "the good cart" at Aldi. Suddenly, Terrence stiffened before saying "too late" and sprinting away into the streets. I gave chase, but he was impossibly fast. I didn't catch up until we had made it to the town square. What I saw there made my next decision extremely simple. 


The formerly missing had converged on the area. They all stood around, slack jawed and staring at the clock tower in the center of town. A straggler, who I recognized to be  Jonah Newport, arrived on the scene and it was as if a switch had been flipped. Two hundred and sixty seven bodies simultaneously disrobed. Their heads sat atop bodies devoid of flesh. Held aloft and upright by nothing more than bones which had been brutally marred. Looking closely at Terrence, who was nearest to me, I could see the marks of gnawing teeth along every inch of exposed bone. The missing climbed over top of one another until they formed a massive human pyramid. Jonah Newport climbed to its apex and proceeded to dive  directly into the mouth of Lane Pommson. As Jonah made his way toward the ground, the rest of the pyramid followed suit. Those standing on the ground were flung high into the air. The pyramid stood inverted as Jonah slid into the dry earth with a squelch. The others did not follow Jonah on his subterranean journey. Instead their bodies smashed against the earth, their skeletons scattering in all directions, leaving only a pile of still animated heads surrounded by thousands upon thousands of bones. Each head was spewing a word salad the likes of which has never been seen. The cacophony of their pointless vocalizations was nearly as disturbing as what had led them there.


That was when I made the best decision I had made all week. I left. As my battle scarred Corolla rolled away from the town of Bar Harbor, I could just barely see a long line of purple streaks flying away from the clearing which had become Yorut's grave.
