August 31, 2024.



I've always loved reading horror stories. They fascinated me, especially those with a macabre plot twist. I enjoyed reading them while sipping my coffee, but ever since that damned incident last month, I haven't been able to open a single story again.



That morning, as usual, I was browsing creepypasta subreddits while drinking my coffee. I'd practically read them all. But that day, something strange happened. Amid thousands of posts flooded with upvotes and comments, there was one story... with no likes, no comments. Completely forgotten. I clicked. I started reading.



***WARNING.***



The story was cliché. Nothing special. It seemed inspired by those old slasher films where teenagers get massacred. THE IRONY. Just another recycled story among so many. I finished reading and went to work. Another shitty day, with my boss yelling at me as usual.



When I got home, I noticed something strange. The front door was slightly open. At first, I thought I'd forgotten to lock it.



***STOP.***



I entered cautiously. My town wasn't known for high crime rates. I searched the entire house. Nothing out of the ordinary. I tried to forget about it and carry on with my night.



At 1 a.m., I woke up. The hallway light was flickering nonstop.



"Damn faulty wiring again..." I muttered, going back to sleep.



Five minutes later, I woke up startled by the sound of plates shattering in the kitchen. Horror clichés are pure fiction, RIGHT?



I got up and went to the kitchen. Everything was a mess. I was organized. This wasn't normal.



As I picked up the broken plates, I saw marks... of blood. Messages written:



***YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE READ THAT STORY.***



My stomach turned to ice. How did someone know? This was always my secret hobby. I screamed. I called the police.



They arrived quickly. They collected blood samples. No signs of a break-in. The kitchen didn't even have a window.



Days later, the results: the blood was mine. But how? I wasn't injured. I had no history of sleepwalking. I didn't do drugs.



***OR DID I?***



The police dismissed it as a prank. They warned me. But the messages kept coming. Every night, in different places: on the bathroom mirror, on the bedroom window.



***I WARNED YOU.***



And it wasn't just messages. "Accidents" that could have been fatal started happening—coincidentally.



A brick fell out of nowhere, almost hitting me. A pitbull attacked me for no reason. I was nearly run over by a speeding car—I was the only pedestrian on the street. I slipped three times in the shower, with no explanation.



And then my house... caught fire. No cause. I lost everything.



Homeless, I got fired from my job. I had no peace. I moved back in with my parents, but I quickly realized I was putting them in danger.



Now I'm writing this on my phone. If you're reading this, understand: sooner or later, I won't be able to escape. This thing will get me. There's no use fighting.



The story I read... condemned me. And if you've read this far...



***YOU'RE NEXT.***
