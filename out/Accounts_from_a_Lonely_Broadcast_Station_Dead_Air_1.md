 

From up here, you can see everything: rows and rows of rich evergreens, hazy mountain peaks, a wide blue sky. You can see the sleepy little village of Pinehaven, the town where I was born, and miles upon miles of empty road leading to somewhere. And sometimes, if you’re really lucky, you can see the most glorious golden sunrise ascending over the mountaintop as if the whole world was on fire.

I was having one of those lucky mornings as I stood by the lookout window, here in the repurposed firewatch tower that had become the center of operations for 104.6 F.M.: the radio station that shouldn’t exist. 

My name is Evelyn. [I’ve told my story before, twice in fact](https://www.reddit.com/user/wendingus/comments/z5dn1d/the_lonely_broadcast_post_index/). That was a long time ago, but don’t worry - I’ll catch you up to speed. Yes, Pinehaven Radio is still on the air, the fog still rolls in from time to time as it always has, and every day is still a gamble between boredom, terror, and batshit stupidity. Sometimes the clocks run backwards. Yesterday, the staircase gained about 17 extra steps, but only for an hour. There’s still a bird with human eyes named Bartholemew who sits by the fire escape. He leaves weird little presents outside all the time just to mess with me: piles of earthworms, bottle caps, the occasional collection of sun-bleached human teeth. We don’t know where he gets the teeth. 

We’ve been feeling earthquakes lately. Now and again I see a pale, rotten figure floating upside-down at the treeline, but it only shows up on the security cameras. He’s shy, I suppose. The Amalgamate is still out there. Well, official sources call it The Amalgamate. We just call him ‘Big Boy', because it’s hard to be scared of something called Big Boy, even if it is an enormous, man-eating flesh-giant cobbled together from various human and animal parts. He’s a real piece of shit, too. He’s added a few more body parts since my last update, the greedy bastard. Thankfully, he still only has one of mine.

And sometimes, late at night when I’m listening to the radio after Dan has gone home, I see a bright magenta glow coming from deep in the woods. It pulsates a little bit and carries a strange hum on the evening wind, but then it goes away before the sun rises. I don’t know what it is or where it came from, but I’m not going out there to check it.

But, not everything has been bad.

Our buddy Finn got a promotion. He’s a fancy forest ranger now, with a cool uniform and everything, but he still hangs out here part-time as our official survival expert. I still don’t know his first name and we’re starting to theorize he doesn’t have one, but rather he was just born one day fully-formed with a beard and a gym membership. I finally got myself a set of wheels: an old red pickup truck. Daniel turned 33 this year and Finn and I baked a cake for him, which turned out surprisingly edible even if it did have the texture of cat food. I bought him a vintage Polaroid camera he’d been eyeing and some novelty patterned bow-ties, which he’s been wearing *daily* ever since*.* When we have time, he’s been helping me brush up on my sign language, which is going pretty well…And my Spanish, which is going terribly. 

We’re thinking of decorating the radio station for Christmas soon. You might wonder why we even bother to breathe life into this place, but the answer is very simple: even a little corner of hell can be a home if you’re stubborn enough.

I was watching one of the security cameras, glaring over a coffee cup. All night, I had been seeing this hunched-over creature, vaguely dog-shaped, staggering back and forth by the treeline as if trying to cross the boundary. It had been at it for hours and it was still there, only now it was staring directly at the camera lens, just far enough away that I couldn’t make out its face. I think it knew I was watching. I was about to try throwing a stick into the woods to see if it would chase it and leave, but it ran off when it heard a car pull up in the long gravel driveway. A few minutes later, the door swung open. A gust of cold air came blowing in as my *now full-time* co-host, Daniel Esperanza, stood there rubbing his frozen hands together like a cricket that made a wish to be turned into a man.

I had big plans today, and he was going to be joining me.

“It’s moving day, my good *bitch!”* I exclaimed joyously after chugging an entire cup of coffee in one go. Dan raised his arms up in triumph, whooping excitedly and then reaching out to give me a high five. I tried to slap his hand, but I missed completely.

“Good morning to you too.” He laughed at my pathetic display. “So, ya little vampire bat, are you excited to move out of the storage closet at long last?” 

I threw my head back with an exasperated sound. “Oh god, you have *no* idea,” I told him, already getting my coat on. I had packed already, so prepared to get out of that dusty cave and move into a slightly bigger cave with windows. “I’m gonna miss the smell of mold and the spiders, though. Made for a good midnight snack.” 

Daniel snickered as I snapped my teeth with a loud click. He was fishing his keys out of his pocket. “Oh, you’ll still get plenty of that, don’t you worry. Come on, let’s bust you out of this joint.”

As we left the broadcast station on a cold winter morning, filling the back of Dan's station wagon, Finn was already pulling up to take over my shift. He gave us a sleepy wave as our vehicles passed like two ships in the night. On the way to the apartment building, I felt…good. I felt like things were finally working out for me after all this time. Shocking, I know.

“So, the landlord kinda sucks.” Dan explained on the way. “He never shows up on time when something breaks and he tries to do a lot of repairs on his own, but he’s bad at it. So if the ceiling springs a leak, make sure you have buckets on hand. Oh, and I live on the second floor, so if you ever need–” 

“Dan, buddy, it’s fine.” I interrupted him with a laugh. “I know, I know, you’ve been through it all before. I’ll be *okay.* Really.*”* 

Daniel was grinning as he turned the corner, all while snow flurries melted against the windshield. He spared me the quickest glance of friendly brown eyes, so dark they were almost black, before watching the road again. “Sorry. I know. …I’m just proud of you, Lyn*.* You’ve come a long way and I really want this to work out .”

Me too, amigo.

For the first time in my whole life, I finally *did* feel proud. I mean, I *finally* had a real place of my own. Sure, the plumbing sucks and I’m pretty sure I heard a rumor that the last tenants were busted for selling cocaine, but it’s okay. It’s mine. It’s home. 

It’s better than my last residence. 

“Hey, Danny Boy. Uhh…how are we gonna get a couch up to the fifth floor?”

He made a popping sound with his lips and then sighed, long and displeased. “...I hadn’t thought about that.” 

\_\_

What do you do when you get that feeling that you’ve already lived this day before? You know what it’s like. It starts with one familiar word or smell or sight, and suddenly you’re back in that place you forgot about. You’re back in a place that used to be special. It was the strain on my muscles as I carried a cardboard box up a set of stairs, filled just a little too heavy. It was the jingle of a new set of keys and the embarrassing struggle of trying to open a sticking door for the first time. It was the familiar face of a friend, being just as incompetent as I was.

“Okay, go a little more left. No, left. Left! Danny, *left!”* 

“Your left and mine are *not the same*!”

Daniel and I were trying and failing to get a sofa through the door. We ended up having to put it down and rethink our approach, all while this cumbersome piece of furniture sat diagonally in a hallway under a flickering, dirty yellow light. 

“We’re a comedy of errors, you and I.” Daniel said as he stretched a long leg over the arm of the couch and climbed over, deciding to plop down. He sank into the cushions, half-disappearing as his whole body turned into a big, limp noodle. “It’s comfortable, at least. Where’d you get it?” 

“From the dump. Don’t worry, I scraped some of the mold off. Not the fleas, though, they can stay.” I let myself fall onto the couch, head against the cushion and my legs dangling over the arm. Daniel only briefly wrinkled his nose. He had stopped being bothered by my jokes a long time ago, learning to keep up with my annoying bull-fuckery. 

“That’s no issue, you’ve *always* had fleas.” He flashed a big, stupid grin and poked me square in the forehead. “Thrift store?”

“Yeah, thrift store.”

Side by side on a sofa too big to fit through the door, we looked like...well, a couple of absolute dipshits. And there it was again, the feeling that I had been here before. I could smell the fresh paint in my memory. I could hear the struggle and the laughter on the day Jennifer moved me into her apartment. Sometimes, when those thoughts were this vivid, I forgot that she had been gone for a long, long time. 

God, I miss her.

It’s winter now. The green of summer had turned brown and the warm humid air was choked by the bitter cold of the mountain. Another season, gone. No, not gone. *Survived.* Jesus, how long has it been? Three years? Four? Now as another year came to an end, Daniel, Finn, and I could say what was once thought to be impossible: we had lasted longer than anyone else. 

It only took 27 former radio DJs for a couple to finally stick, I guess.

It was another hour of struggling, lifting, and arguing, but the deed was finally done. My new place didn’t look like much, nor did it smell the greatest, but compared to a storage closet or the underside of a yellow park slide, it was fantastic. After taking a few pictures of me with the Polaroid, despite my protests, Dan parked himself back down on the couch. He was waving one of the photos around while it developed: a nice shot of me flipping off the camera while slumped over the back of the sofa, exhausted.

“You want some water?” I asked after I had time to catch my breath.

“Do you have ice?” Dan stretched out on the sofa, feet hanging off the edge. There was a hint of a shit-eating smirk on his face.

“No, sorry, it all melted in the moving box. Jackass.” I was grabbing a mug out of storage. “Stand outside long enough though, and maybe you’ll catch some snowflakes in your cup.” 

I made the tiny trip over to the kitchenette on legs that felt like two sticks of melting butter. I turned the sink handle but nothing came out. It simply made a weak gurgle of sound and dripped the tiniest bit of brown liquid from the spout. It wasn’t until I decided to give the faucet a nice smack that it actually worked. It rumbled and I watched an uneven spray of gritty, red-brown water start to burst from the pipe, leaving sediment and bits of rust in the basin below. The smell was bitter and it turned my stomach. 

I was eager to turn it off. This was another one of those familiar moments, when my logical brain knew that it was only rust but my memory brought back a feeling so powerful and so clear that I could *feel* the stickiness of fresh blood on my fingertips. I recalled the taste, the texture, and the way the kitchen sink bubbled. 

It wasn’t the same, I told myself. This wasn’t the broadcast room, where blood ran from the faucets and ghosts cried in the pipes every day. But why did it feel like I was still there, like I would *always* be there? 

“Water’s bad.” I wiped my hands on my jeans and turned to lean against the counter. “I’ll go to the store, get a couple of gallons and call the landlord in the morning. Probably just rusted pipes…I’ll be back in a few minutes. Just lock the door if you leave, okay?” 

Dan gave me a tired thumbs up, seemingly in no rush to go anywhere just yet. 

Walking into the shops felt like doing it for the first time, as if my mother had given me a ten dollar bill and sent me on a nerve-wracking mission for toilet paper. I really wasn’t used to having access to the outside world. The lights were so harsh, the sounds overwhelming. I couldn't remember the last time I had been in public like this.

“We’ll leave these outside tonight for Toby, okay? He’ll come back.” 

A woman’s voice caught my attention, and the rattle of a plastic container of dog treats from the other side of the aisle. A small child sniffled. 

“What if Toby don’t want to come out of the woods? What if he likes it better?” 

The woman shushed her child and I heard the squeak of the grocery cart’s wheels as she began to turn it around. “He knows where his home is, baby…” 

I put a bottle of dish soap in my basket without looking. Sometimes it hurts, knowing more than the people here in town. Other times, I envied the innocence of not knowing what happened to those we lost to the forest; Those who would never be the same…Then again, I think some of them knew. It was just easier and safer to bury your head in the sand.

I felt dizzy, walking from aisle to aisle. Sometimes I forgot which direction I was going in and saw the same things again and again, up and down the same few steps. I was seeing colors and shapes of items on the shelves, but I couldn’t tell what they were anymore. I couldn’t remember how to make myself *recognize* them. That swirling cloud of confusion fogged my brain and made it hard to breathe, and for *no reason.* Everything was just so overwhelming, so loud and bright. The anxiety has been getting steadily worse each year, I think.

Goosebumps rose on my arms as the cold from the refrigerators hit my skin. I could hear the blunt chop of a knife against wood as I passed by the deli, one sheet of glass between me and the slabs of meat on display. I could smell the blood, subtle and lingering with the numb scent of cold refrigeration.

I heard a wheeze from below. It was coming from a fish head, freshly chopped from the body but still moving, still gasping for water. Its dead, cold eyes stared directly at me, human and pleading for some kind of release from its pain. My spine began to tingle when I realized it was trying to form words…and that it had a mouth full of teeth that certainly didn’t belong to it.

I heard another loud *chop* from behind the counter, and looked up to see the butcher’s gray, lifeless face. He was smiling impossibly wide with eyes that were just two huge orbs stuck into his head: the eyes of a dead fish. They blinked one at a time with a wet, sticky sound. He brought down his knife again, a splatter of blood hitting his apron as he sliced into some unknown slab of fresh, moving, *breathing* tissue. All at once, everything in the display was alive and wriggling. *Screaming.*

Something cold and wet touched my shoulder. I jumped, a hoarse whimper leaving my throat the moment I heard a voice behind my back.  It was the dry, painful croak of something long dead that rattled in my ear. And out of the corner of my eye, I could see an open mouth, still filled with twigs, leaves, and the smell of woodland decay. Her jaw unhinged with a series of cracks and that dry voice spoke again, her whispers morphing into something that almost began to sound like my name. 

I didn’t want to look. I couldn’t look. The quick-building dread in my heart didn’t want to recognize the face again. *I never wanted to* ***see*** *her again.*

I squeezed my eye shut, every muscle in my body tensing and my fists balled up so forcefully and so tight that I could feel my fingernails cutting into the skin of my palms. If it hurt, maybe it could wake me. Maybe it could end this dream. 

*“Lyn, do you miss me?”* 

Her voice was like gravel; like sawdust in an old, withered, dead throat. 

“*Do you miss me? Do you miss...do you miss...”*

&#x200B;

“Miss?” 

The hand on my shoulder was warm and soft. And all at once, the sounds of the grocery store flooded into my ears and the bright light hit my eye with a sudden, migraine-inducing force. Calm music was playing overhead. I blinked. I was looking at the deli again. The man behind the counter had stopped what he was doing and was watching me, concerned. Everything in the display was…normal. 

“Miss, can you hear me? Is everything alright?”

My heart pounded as I turned my head. Where I expected to see a decayed and withered corpse, I saw the kind face of a lady in a green smock. How long had she been standing there? How long had *I* been standing there? 

“I’m...fine.” My tongue was dry as I spoke. 

I wasn’t fine, not this time. The fact was that I couldn’t leave the station without bringing it with me no matter where I went. That tower and I, we would always be bound together in this terrible, toxic relationship where everything I saw reminded me of that *place*.

It was in my thoughts as I checked out at the front of the store, the people in line behind me whispering to one another. It was there, floating around in my head as I looked up at the overcast sky and stepped into the cold air. And it was still in my thoughts as I headed home, both arms sore from the weight of the grocery bags filled with water, snacks, and a bottle of tequila. I don’t know how it got in my cart.

A cold, eerie wind blew through my hair. A dead leaf rolled across the sidewalk in front of me and I could hear the pines shiver in the breeze. I stopped, turning my head to look into the woods. There was no escaping it, was there? I recalled the night I lost my eye, the night we found Jennifer’s corpse in the tree, the night of the graduation party where I saw … 

Nevermind. 

&#x200B;

From between the trees, I could hear heavy, labored breathing. It was a wet sound, like lungs full of water but unable to cough. I put down my grocery bags and stepped forward, the snow crunching underneath my feet as I left the safety of the sidewalk just to get a closer look. 

I could see something hunched just beyond the treeline, half-hidden in the pines. It had light-colored fur with reddened patches of disease, facing away from me on all fours and vomiting some kind of dark, tarry liquid into the snow. The sound of its retching reminded me of an old man, making me all the more happy that I couldn’t see its face. I don’t think it had a dog’s face anymore. 

“Toby!” I heard a little voice. “Mom, look, it’s Toby!” It was that same young boy who was in the grocery store, pulling on his mother’s hand and pointing at the creature from the sidewalk. The beast bristled and ran off, its gait made clumsy by the fact that its feet seemed to be pointing in the wrong direction. I heard the jingle of a dog collar as it went. 

“No, honey.” The boy’s mother whispered. “That’s not Toby. Now come on, we have to get home. I don’t want you going over there, okay?” 

The woman and I made eye contact for a brief moment, but she looked away and quickened her pace, pushing the child along. As they hurried down the path, I could hear the little boy asking quietly: “Who was that lady? What happened to her eye?” His mother didn’t answer.

The beast from the woods was gone now, slipping deep into the pines. It left behind backwards footprints and a bubbling pile of hot, black acid that was currently sinking into the ground and melting the snow around it. Note to self…If you find more traces of forbidden goo in the woods, do not touch it, no matter how tempting.

The hallway of the apartment complex was dark, illuminated only by the ruddy yellow light above the stairwell and the glowing red exit sign at the end of the hall. I approached my own apartment door, listening. It was quiet, all except for the electric buzz of a malfunctioning light from the other side. 

When I opened the door, I was greeted with a darkened room and the sight of Daniel, standing on a step stool in the center of the kitchen, screwing a lightbulb into the ceiling. 

“It burned out.” He said, grunting as he tried to get the bulb in tight. “But I’ve *aaalmost* got it -- there. Finally...You okay?” 

As I watched the flickering light stabilize at last and cast a glow back on the room, my absent mind began to thaw itself out. 

“Yeah, I’m good. Wish they’d put an elevator in though.” As I watched the ladder underneath Dan’s feet jiggle under his tiniest movements, I cringed. “I'll give you a present if you promise to get down off that rickety thing before you bust your skull open.” 

I reached into my newly-purchased groceries and grabbed a bag of chips, tossing it towards Daniel once his feet were on solid ground again. I couldn’t help the smirk on my face as he fumbled both of his hands in an attempt to catch it before it hit the floor. “It’s the dinner of champions,” I told him.

He squeezed both sides of the bag, letting it pop open and wincing as he prepared for the jump scare it gave him. “Barbeque potato chips?”

I was already munching on my own bag of greasy goodness. I was surprised to hear him bitching, especially since the last time I tried to cook dinner for the three of us, I burned the soup. Who burns *soup?* “Champions aren’t picky, Daniel. Eat your fuckin’ chips.” 

\_\_\_

I had the night off. Dan was going to take over after Finn and I’d take the morning shift, giving me time to settle in and unpack. In the time we had before his departure, we ate junk food and used the dodgy public wi-fi to watch dumb videos on the internet. 

But as I watched my co-worker prepare to leave, I was faced with an unfamiliar anxiety: the safety and ignorance of being on the outside. I wanted to be happy to have a place to live outside of that godforsaken wooden tower. I was *proud* of myself and I was excited for this new adventure…but why wasn’t I *happy*?

Before he went, Daniel insisted on one more picture - one of the both of us to immortalize a hard day’s work. This time, we both made silly faces. He handed me the Polaroid and I stuck it to the fridge like a piece of macaroni art.

“Thanks for the help, Danny Boy.” I said, handing him his bag. 

His smile was generous and reliable. Selfless, as always. “Don’t mention it.” He said. “Let’s just say you owe me. Breakfast is on you tomorrow, ok?” 

He put a hand on the top of my head, ruffling my hair into a ginger bird’s nest. “Get some sleep, freckle-face. I’ll see you when we trade shifts.”

He left, the tap of his oxfords disappearing down the stairwell. Now it was just me, a room full of boxes, and an ever-persistent case of anxiety as I noticed the view of the trees from my place on the fifth floor. 

I could see everything from up here.

It was snowing outside. It built up on the sides of the road, leaving the black pavement wet and glistening. A bell rang out nine times, coming from the little church two streets down. The sound was shrill and metallic.

I pulled a dusty, battery-operated radio out of storage, setting it down on the floor next to the sofa after programming my morning alarm. The old antique still had some sharpie marker stains on the bottom - F. M., it said. Frank McKinnon. A pale memory came back to me, of sitting in a truck bed in the summer while wearing my dad’s coat, watching the stars and listening to the radio. I didn’t know any better back then. 

Man, I forgot I even had this thing. If I focused really hard, it still smelled a bit like the old firestation. Smoke and gasoline…

You know, I’ve been thinking about him a lot lately.

Curiously, I turned the dial, finding that rare, in-between station I knew so well: 104.6 F.M. An even number. Anywhere else in the country, it would probably be static. But here, it was the only station you could get. I heard the muffled voice of our part-timer, Finn, on the other end, his bored and deadpan tone reading out the end of the weather forecast. It was going to be a foggy night, he said. A good night to stay indoors…A good night to keep the doors locked and the radio on.

I put my pillow on the other side of the couch so that I didn’t have to face the window while I slept. I think I should have picked up some curtains. 

This is Evelyn McKinnon from 104.6 F.M. And despite everything, we’re still on the air.
