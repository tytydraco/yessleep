I don’t know why I’m bothering with this. Maybe it’s the whiskey. Maybe it’s the need to get some kind of outside perspective from people who won’t be able to tell my family how much of a psycho I’m turning out to be in my old age.



Maybe it’s both.



I run a small property out in the middle of nowhere. Not going to say where—just know it’s woodlands. I’m a craftsman. I sell pieces I make out of my shop. Nothing major. The usual things rich people who want to appear worldly and outdoorsy go for. Lights made from deer antlers—mostly sheds, but they don’t know that. Tables, lounges, cabinets made from odd pieces of wood.



The business was handed down to me from my uncle, who had enough connections with a few wealthier families to keep things moving. It used to be more of a side thing when I was younger, but… life happens.



I’m not rich by any means, but the property is paid for. A lot of my materials come from just walking the several acres my family owns. Fallen trees for “reclaimed” wood. Shed deer antlers are fairly common in the spring. Occasionally we get a group of coyotes wandering through, which means I end up with bone for knife handles and gun grips, along with some furs that sometimes sell well as wall hangers.



It’s not glamorous, but it keeps me supplied for my better-selling pieces and gives me something to feed the crayfish down by the creek.



I’m telling you all this to let you know that, well—



I’m not much of a people person.



I live alone. Family visits, sure, but since the divorce my kids don’t really have much to do with me. I’m not sure I really blame them. At least my son still takes my calls, even if he tries to get out of them.



So when I saw something like what I caught on my game camera footage two weeks ago…



Well, I don’t have many people to tell.



My brother, for instance, is too much of a drunken ass to really listen. He just thinks I’m going crazy like Mom did. But I’m not sitting here talking about angels trying to whisk me away.



It’s furry, whatever it is. My first thought was maybe a particularly large black bear, but that didn’t sit right. This thing moved pretty quick. I’ve seen black bears, and sure, they can run, but they’re used to being the biggest thing around this deep in the woods. They move slow—lazy even—unless food’s on the line.



Every time I caught a glimpse of this thing, it was moving quick and steady. Not stopping to sniff or investigate. Straight line.



Usually it was too far away to be in focus, or if I was lucky it’d show up right at the edge of a camera. I’d get a few seconds of black fur in frame directly below one, but never enough for a good look. Sure, it could’ve just been a really skittish black bear. Maybe it smelled me on the cameras.



But the way it moved always gave me the feeling of "I’m going somewhere."

That just isn’t right for an animal like that.



So my thoughts circled around to what else would be wandering around a big stretch of wilderness with nothing out there but the occasional buck and a stream not worth a damn for fishing.



Poachers, maybe. Or some druggies from town looking for a place to tent up for a while. Meth heads do that from time to time. Move out into the woods for whatever reason. After all, the shapes on the cameras were mostly just decent-sized black blobs. Could’ve been a coat, for all these old ten-megapixel cameras knew.



My routine was to check the footage once a week. The cameras mostly took pictures in bursts of five and would start overwriting older shots if you didn’t manually clear them out.



Usually I used them just to make sure nobody was doing anything too dumb out there—and for hunting, obviously. I’d never seen much worth talking about before.



After watching the footage, I figured I’d test the bear theory. That wasn’t hard to do. Black bears like an easy meal.



I still had offal from my last hunt that I hadn’t processed into fish bait yet. I let it thaw overnight, and the next day I tossed a few scraps out in plain sight of the cameras where I’d seen the thing pass by.



The week passed pretty quickly after that. I had an order for a classic armchair frame that needed some weirdly specific engravings done—by hand only. Weird, but nothing I couldn’t handle. I’ve had stranger requests that paid less, so I was happy to oblige.



Once I let the client know the chair was ready, I got myself set. Thermos loaded with coffee, it was finally time to do my rounds.



When I noticed the bait was gone, I felt a little smug. Figured I’d caught the dumb animal on camera. I swapped out the SD cards and took my time walking back home.



I wasn’t pleased with what I saw.



Coyotes. Lots of coyotes. Apparently the meat had attracted more of the pests. Or at least, that’s what should have attracted them.



Coyotes are annoying things. They eat just about anything, including each other.



But they’re not this stupid. They learn where people usually are and go around. Packs scrounge through my land or pass through it, but they don’t hang around. Every once in a while a few get brave and poke around, but I’m pretty quick about taking them down. Seeing more than a couple is odd—especially since I’d cleared a few out just last month.



And they certainly don’t travel close enough to my house to trip the cameras they did.



And the worst part?



That damn thing was still there. In the background. It looked like it was just strolling along a ridgeline while four or five coyotes stood around my camera, nipping at deer liver.



So I made up my mind. It wasn’t a smart decision, but it was the one I made.



I oiled up the family .30-06 and got ready for a classic coyote clean-out. I figured if anyone was hanging around, the sound of gunfire would “encourage” them to clear out. I wasn’t planning on keeping the pelts this time, and I didn’t feel like breaking out the .223 in case something was off with the “bear.”



I don’t need to think about it to know that was a dumb idea.



If it was meth heads, they’d probably just shoot me and be done with it. If it was a couple of local idiots, me just being there would’ve scared them off. It’s not like poachers around here were getting anything special—just regular old whitetail.



I should’ve told somebody. Left my kid a voicemail. Let someone in town know to maybe check on me in a couple of days.



But like I said, I’m not really a people person.



So I didn’t.



I checked the closest camera site first—the one that normally caught nothing but possums. Nothing left but coyote scat. Figured the pack was bedding down deeper in, so I kept walking.



Second site, more of the same.



It wasn’t until about two hours into my walk that I finally saw something odd at the third camera site.



A deer. Dead.



But not by coyotes. At least, I didn’t think so.



It was laid out with its back to me. Looked like it had taken a shot to the head, judging by the bloody spot on top of its skull.



Poachers, then. But why leave it? From behind it looked like a solid deer. Even out of season for antlers, that’s a lot of meat to walk away from.



As I got closer, I noticed the second wound.



It had been slit open—no, that wasn’t right. It had been cut. The cut was only maybe half a foot wide, just below the ribs, around lung height.



Weird place to start gutting.



That was when things started to click.



This wasn’t an old kill. Even if the coyotes hadn’t found it yet, something would’ve torn into it if it had been sitting overnight.



My chest tightened. I became very aware of the fact that I was a middle-aged guy alone in the woods with someone I didn’t know, leaving fresh kills on my property.



I glanced around, rifle low but finger twitching. I’d never thought I’d be getting into a firefight, and the idea had me staring wide-eyed at the tree line. Brush, low branches, hilly ground—plenty of places to hide.



I stepped back toward the deer and knelt, rifle still raised. I pressed my palm against its neck.



I’d never been so relieved to feel cool skin. Whoever did this might still be around, but at least I hadn’t walked up on someone mid-gut.



I looked back down at the incision, trying to guess what they could’ve been after. Lung height, maybe a little lower.



It wasn’t carved. Just a relatively clean cut, maybe pried open. I briefly considered a predator going for the wound, but there was no tearing, no hanging flesh to suggest a bite.



Standing back up took a second—my joints aren’t what they used to be—but movement in the distance gave me plenty of motivation.



Just beyond a hill, too far to see clearly but close enough to recognize.



A black, fuzzy shape. Striding with purpose.



Not a bear.



It was walking on two legs. Not too tall—maybe a little shorter than me—but big enough to be a person. I raised my rifle, started to line up a shot, and then it stepped into a thick stand of trees and vanished.



That’s where I should’ve stopped. Gone home. Called the wardens.



I’d found an out-of-season kill and seen some weirdo in a fur jacket trespassing. Every bit of sense I had was screaming to let the authorities handle it.



I don’t know why I followed them.



The thought that if I lost them they’d just leave and come back later wasn’t smart, but it was enough. I think part of me just wanted to see for myself the thing that had been sitting in the back of my mind for half a month.



I crept forward. Figured I’d lag behind, but if I kept a steady pace I might catch up when they stopped—or find a campsite and finally have this dealt with.



I don’t know how they moved the way they did. I never heard anything. No snapped branches. No crunch of leaves. That black blur moved like a ghost through my property.



No matter how far behind I thought I was, I always managed to pick them out. Sometimes just a speck at the edge of the trees. Other times close enough to make out the fuzzy outline—but never close enough to really see.



I guessed they were about five-three. They passed a fallen stump that came up to my chin, and they matched it almost exactly. 



It took me a while to realize they were walking from camera to camera, pausing just long enough for me to keep up without having to move too quickly.

It took a while longer to notice the carvings.

It was at the sixth camera when I finally saw it. The thing had lingered for a moment by the tree where the camera was strapped. I paused long enough to try swapping out the SD card, and that’s when I noticed a bare patch of bark not too far below the camera where a crude circle within a circle had been carved.

Maybe a marker. Still, why go through the trouble when an X would do?

I followed for another two hours. Past the last of my cameras. I’m pretty sure that after that, they walked me in a circle at least once before heading deeper into the woods—places I’d never bothered exploring. I was only barely sure we were still on my land. As far as I knew, nobody lived anywhere near where we’d wandered.

The black figure crested another thickly wooded hill. I still had no earthly idea how they’d managed it without stumbling or making a sound. I was moving at a painfully slow pace, trying to catch up quietly, while they moved like it was nothing. They didn’t even rustle the leaves.

Hands in the dirt, gripping at exposed roots. Crawling. No way I was going to do this without some kind of sound, but this was as quiet as it was going to get.

When I reached the top, hands covered in dirt and bits of dried leaves, I ignored the wet sensation under my right palm, mistaking it for mud. It only sank in when I put weight on it and felt something give, sending me flopping onto my side, my face landing on whatever had slid out from under me.

My first thought was scat. It took a lot not to come up cussing as I wiped what I was sure was digested possum off my face.



I stopped when I saw my hand coming away red.



I stared at my open palm. A small speck of purple goo sat near the center, a red smear trailing down from my fingertips.



“What the hell?” I mouthed.



I shook my hand and looked down at what I’d slipped on. An off-color hunk of meat, tangled with dirt and twigs.



It almost looked like the bait I’d thrown out.



Like a liver.



Did the coyotes bring it up here? I’d never known them to bother carrying scraps, but—



A loud creak cut my thoughts off. I hadn’t realized how long I’d been moving in silence, but whatever made that sound might as well have been right next to my ear.



Thud.



Soft, but definite.



I was looking at a house. Or maybe a cabin was more accurate. A simple log structure, sitting where I was certain nothing should’ve been. Planter boxes under plain glass windows.



A light came on behind red curtains.



I stood there, staring, trying to make sense of it. This wasn’t just someone passing through. Whatever I’d been following had settled in.



At least, that’s what I thought at the time.



This is getting long, and I’m starting to pass out. The whiskey catches up to me faster than it used to, and I’m still exhausted from all of this.



I’ll post the rest soon, if anyone’s interested.
