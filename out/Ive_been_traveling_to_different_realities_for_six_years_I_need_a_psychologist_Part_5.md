Their voices. My alternate self and her two fellow psychos. Things I didn't want to hear, aside from ruffling leaves, human screams, monotonous growling, and the wet sound of a creature eating human guts. I had enough of all that and the stuff it implied. I didn't want to go back. My body was filled with adrenaline. I navigated through the forest, making sure I made as little noise as possible. No stepping in bushes, no stepping on twigs, and hopefully no birds would chirp loudly in my vicinity.


After five minutes of walking, I thought I was alone, but somebody shouted at me.


"Hey!" they shouted. "Identify yourself!"


I glanced towards the source of the shouting. It was a woman in a suit. She looked like an agent.


"Nicole Winston," I said. "I'm kinda running from three psychopaths right now."


"Can you tell me more about this?"


"Three people who want to kidnap and torture me are chasing me right now," I said. "They want to take me somewhere dangerous."


"Where?"


"You would… probably think I'm the insane one if I told you that."


"Considering you popped out of an anomalous bubble, I'm willing to believe anything you say," She said. "You can run it by me in a way that's comfortable for you."


I explained to her the entire reality hopping situation, then the situation with my alternate self.


"So you took her device and left as a self defense mechanism, and then he found you, and now he wants you to die in a cataclysmic scenario…"


"Yes."


"Do you have any proof of you being in the alleged alternate realities?"


"Yes, but I kinda want to be a reality jumping journalist. I want to download recorded videos to my phone and archive them."


"Even if we confiscate the videos you have, you can get them back with a confidential request."


I showed her the video of the giant destroying the Empire State Building, the videos of the giants destroying the Burlington Skyway Bridge, and the helicopter footage of the Creature Dump I was caught up in.


"Who took this footage?"


"Their names weren't cited," I said, wishing I knew. "So I don't know."


"That's alright," she said. "What were those little black things the giant was pouring onto the city?"


I explained the creatures to her and showed her the video taken in a toll booth the creature was breaking into.


"Holy shit," she said to herself.


"It's all pretty heavy," I said.


"Very heavy… yes," she said, looking back up at me. "Where do you live?"


I told her where I lived, but then I explained I would need some defense if I were to go back to where I lived. She told me she needs all the evidence she can get. I took that as something promising. She took out her phone to text who I assumed was one of her affiliates, then she told me something I was happy to hear.


"We will be watching you for more evidence," she said. "If they show any harmful intention, we will intervene."


"Thank you so much," I said.


 "What is that?" She asked herself, looking to her left. Her pupils dilated, then she walked off into the forest, out of my view.


As I waited for her to come back, a pain hit my neck. I looked back and saw my alternate self standing by the trees, holding a white gun. My heart sank.


No… god no…


I woke up laying on a couch in a basement. I looked to my left and saw a window on a wall lined with pipes. I looked to my right and saw a TV. I also saw a bathroom nearby. I sat up, wondering where the hell I was. My alternate self or one of his buddies, or all three of them, took me somewhere I don't recognize. I don't feel this is going to go down very well.


I stood up and looked around for a way out. I found a staircase across the basement. I walked over to it, bindly hoping the door was unlocked. I took the steps up to the door and turned the knob, but it wouldn't move. Of course. I thought maybe they would've at least let me around the home.


I looked outside. The sky was cloudless. There we're at least a few homes lined up on the other side of the road. I could hear the sound of a lawn mower coming from the neighbors house.


I stepped away from the window.


Where am I?


I reached for my phone, but it wasn't in my pocket. I checked my other pocket, but it wasn't in there either. I went up to the TV and switched it on. CBS News was on. A female reporter was talking about the creature dump in Washington DC. I looked at the time. 11:34 AM. The news reporter talked about the fall of the United States and said people were speculating that each US city would suffer the same fate, including New York City. A witness was brought on the phone to discuss what he saw in Washington.


"Yeah, I was walking out of a clothing store when I saw two giants standing in the distance," he said. "They were dumping those… things, those creatures onto the city. It was scary. I ran for my life."


As the reporter began to talk about the military response, the TV shut off. All electrical humming stopped, including the humming coming from the lawn mower.


I went up to the window, hoping somebody would see me from where I was standing. I looked out. Nothing was happening. I couldn't see any people, no cars were driving by, nothing. I stood there, waiting for somebody to walk by. After probably two minutes, two people began to have a conversation next door.


"Your power's off too?" said one of them, in a light southern accent.


"Yeah and coincidentally the lawn mower died," said the other.


"There's better ones you can get anyway."


"I know and I want to look for some online but my phone is dead," he said. "I swore it was at 80% ten minutes ago."


"I'll check mine… wait, I don't remember turning it off or anything... why won't it turn on?"


A series of thuds, stopped the two from speaking to each other and lightly shook the pipes. Thud… thud… thud… it sounded like fuse boxes exploding in the distance.


Come on… please, no


The noises stopped.


Building smashing?


Gas attack?


Torching?


"Those better not be…"


"I'm not taking any chances"


Thud… thud… thud… thud thud.


My nerves choked me. I continued to stare outside, thinking I might as well catch a glimpse of the giants before they destroy everything. I threw up in my mouth a little.


I was drenched in sweat. I was in an EMP Bubble and a giant was walking around somewhere near whatever town I was in. I had to brace for the worst. No, the window wasn't big enough for me to crawl out of. I was trapped in a basement my alternate self knew something was going to happen to. I stepped back from the window and began to tear up. Tears streamed down to my chin as I thought back to the good times I had hopping to different realities.


I knew feeling scared was the point. Sometimes the giants would attack cities or wipe entire countries off the map. They couldn't be going for specific people in those places… they wanted us to feel scared. Maybe some good titans would arrive and take care of the bad ones. Stop them from committing their crimes. Stop them from inspiring fascism. I don't remember what day this happened on but sometime after the attack began and sometime before the Chechen area was wiped off the map, the Chechen Republic, Belarus, and Pakistan banned civilian travel on roads and proclaimed any protest against said measures would be labeled pro-terrorism and therefore acts of civil war.


I know those countries were always that way, but the fact they used the attacks as an excuse to attack their own people was scary and depressing.


I walked back up to the window. Where are the giants?


A flock of birds flew by out of formation and multiple dogs began to bark loudly.


"We're being gassed!" one of the men yelled.


There's my answer.


I stepped back. A shade covered everything outside. A mist of thousands upon thousands of black specs blew by, battering everything and obscuring my view of the outside world. They battered the window, covering it up until the room went dark. I couldn't see. All I could hear was the sound of dogs… choking. I noticed the birds were no longer chirping.


When is this going to end? I asked myself under my breath.


I got out of my frozen state and sprinted towards the far side of the basement, tripping over a box along the way. Pain hit me as I landed on the ground, but I dreaded the death specs too much to care. I got up and sprinted over to the pile of clothes on the ground. I didn't know how much it would protect me, but I had to cover my mouth with some sort of mask. I felt around for whatever I could find in the pitch darkness. I picked up a piece of clothing, then I held it over my nose and mouth, and tied it up. I sat down, staring in the direction of the window. A minute later, rays of sunlight began to shine into the room. I walked up to the window to take a look outside.


Bunches of specks were peeling off of the window. The bottom corners of the window still had some specks, which were peeling off at a slower rate, falling onto a pile of specks on the grass. The rooftops of the houses I could see were coated in dark grayness. Same with the trees and the parked cars. 4-5 birds were scattered across each rooftop. As I looked around at the frightening scene, a dark speck floated by my eyes. My nerves set off. I stumbled backwards, but the speck floated towards my mouth.


The speck landed on the shirt, above where my mouth is. It pushed itself against the shirt. I avoided touching it. I tried to shake it off of me, but it was stuck. It began to cut through the fabric, which inspired a huge rush of adrenaline. I pulled the tied shirt off my head and threw it onto the floor. Breathing heavily, I glanced in every direction, watching for more specks. There were none.


The speck sat on the shirt, not moving at all. In fact, it was turning grey. Maybe the specks only lasted a few minutes? I slowly walked up to the shirt. The speck still wasn't moving. Hesitantly, I kicked the shirt. The speck laid still. As I looked in confusion, I heard voices coming from outside.


I went up to the window and peeked outside. As the voices became decipherable, I listened in, blindly hoping there was a rescue team on the way.


"...no, that's lose sight."


"How do you pronounce the last name of the 21 people killed? The one that starts with a T? Not the W or the D."


"Tsaroas"


"I wish we could figure out the reason why specific surnames were targeted."


"They just wanted to get rid of them."


"Over what? It's not like the giants knew them personally."


"It could've been anything, even a small interaction. They've killed over 100 Million people so far, which would be insane in that case."


As they walked into view along the sidewalk, I noticed they were men who were in their 30s. They were both wearing all black with matching logo shirts. Although, as I looked at the matching logos, they began to look more like matching symbols. Two straight lines side by side with a bolded diagonal line shooting through both, along with four letters: COST. They kicked at the specks as if they were rocks.


I was confused. I heard the gass killed every living thing it touched. Were those two just dumb enough to exit their homes without being careful? Or did they figure out the specks die as well before I figured it out? Were they unlucky? Was this not their first time being caught up in a gassing?


The two guys took a right and walked towards the house. Oh shit, they live here? The front door creaked open, then shut. Do they know I'm down here? Footsteps went by until the door knob to the basement began to shake. A pit formed in my stomach. The door opened. The two guys stepped down the stairway.


"Okay, she didn't kill herself."


Once they reached the bottom of the stairs, they walked up to me with stern looks on their faces. The guy with brown hair spoke to me.


"Alright, my name is Alex and his name is Gerald," he said. "We see you aren't dead, so we're going to go with our other plan."


"What the hell do you want with me?" I asked with growing frustration.


"True Nicole wanted you to be taken care of," Alex said, giving me a smirk. He then spoke in a soft tone. "In a few minutes, six special people will be here. They will be giving you the slow treatment."


"Oh come on," I said, shaking. Special people? Who could they be at this point?


"Scared?" Gerald asked. "You shouldn't have gone around slandering the giants."


"Do you two really… like the giants that much?" I asked. "Why?"


"So far they've shown they're more powerful than us," Alex said. "If we don't do what they say, they'll come after us. That includes you."


"I like them because there's something about them that's just so calming and cathartic," Gerald said. "It's not difficult to understand."


"Is there ANY way I can get out of this?" I asked.


"No," Alex said. "You slander, you're trash."


Six people stepped down the stairs. They looked to be around my age. Once on the floor, they walked up behind Alex and Gerald, who moved off to the side and welcomed the visitors as they walked by. They walked up to me and introduced themselves.


A boy with blond hair introduced himself as Grady
A boy with black hair introduced himself as Johnny
A boy with dark brown hair introduced himself as Ryan
A girl with dark hair introduced herself as Chloe
Another girl with dark hair introduced herself as Kale
A third girl with dark hair introduced herself as Kali


Grady walked up to me and put his hand on my left shoulder. I froze up. I tried to move my feet, but they wouldn't move. I tried to move my hands, but they wouldn't budge. What's he doing? How is he doing it?


Johnny and Ryan walked up to me and put their hands on my shoulders. An ache invaded my head. Quick enough, it was like I was wearing a hat of displeasure.


Chloe and Kale walked up to me and put their hands on my shoulders. My nerves quaked violently. Anxiety causing imagined scenarios filled my brain. They went by too quickly to think about one by one, but they still troubled me. A lot of them involved having my actions be taken the wrong way, then getting in trouble. My brain fogged up.


Kali walked up to me and put her hand on my left shoulder. The anxious imagined scenarios swirled around my head faster. A pit of social dread formed in my stomach. A burning sensation hit me all over. It was discomforting to the max, but I wasn't able to do anything about it.


When the hell was this going to end!? Where did these people even come from? Where did they get these abilities?


This had to have been the beginning of my death. I was going to be tortured in every way possible until I slowly, but surely, passed out forever. The abilities these superpeople were using on me were chillingly strong and effective.


Kali kept her hand on my shoulder. Pain pulsated through my body. My eyes felt like bursting, my nose felt like it was being cut, my teeth began to ache, the rest of my body felt like it was being stabbed with a hundred knives. Naturally, I wanted to move, but again, I couldn't. I wanted to get out of the basement and travel to a reality so obscure my alternate self wouldn't be able to find me. As the pain cut deeper, a woman stepped down to the basement.


"What's going on here?" she asked.


"Who are you?" Alex asked.


"Victoria," she said. She looked at the six psychos and raised an eyebrow. "Well, I dealt with some others. I can deal with all of you too."


"Get away from us," Kali said.


"Why are you always around us?" Grady asked. "I don't understand. It really is like you can teleport."


"I haven't met you in my life," Victoria said with a confused look on her face. "Who are you?"


"You saw us before," Johnny said.


"I mean you look and sound familiar but other than that… whatever. Tell me what's going on," Victoria said.


"We're about to execute a girl for going against the giants," Alex said.


My mouth was frozen shut, but I let out as much of an audible "help" as I could.


"Wow," Victoria said. "There are cults for this shit? I mean, of course there are. You are seriously messed up."


"We're messed up?" Kali asked.


"You and your friends have killed people too," Grady said.


"Sometimes it's best to forget about people," Victoria said.


Does that really mean kill them though? What even was this dynamic? I'm now caught in the middle of some crazy fight between two groups I don't even want to know anything about at this point.


"We'll take you to hell," Chloe said.


"I don't understand what's happening right now," Alex said. "This isn't the Gangster Disciples. Why is there an argument? You six never mentioned there was an argument. Why is this an early 20s fest anyway? How about look more intimidating? You all look like babies!"


Meanwhile I'm being put into psychological and bodily unrest just my the touch of their hands. Their looks meant nothing.


"Whatever," Victoria said to herself. "This is stupid."


The barrel of a gun poked through the top of the staircase. Metallic darts flew at the group in quick succession. Grady, Johnny, Ryan, and Alex fell to the ground. Chloe, Gerald, Kale, and Kali jumped. Kali took her hand off me. The four were struck, then they fell at almost the exact same time. They laid still. Quiet. Victoria stood in her spot in front of the stairs.


"All clear," the gunman said.


"This is what happens when you let your equipment fall into the hands of people who just assume anything they want to," Victoria said under her breath.


"Alright," Victoria said. "I'm going to have these people killed so they can't bother anyone anymore. You are free now. Would you like anything?"


"Get me away from here," I said. "Far away… I…" I trailed off. I didn't know where to go specifically. Or even generally. Where was a random reality?


"Where would you like us to take you?" Victoria asked.


"If you do alternate reality travel, I'd like to be taken to a reality hundreds of thousands of realities away from this one," I said with an eager tone.


"Yeah, I mean, I could see what I can do," Victoria said. "I haven't done reality jumping before."


I was relieved. At least I was on their good side. Millions of people? How big was this feud?


"What did they mean by millions of people?" I asked.


"You don't need to know," Victoria said. "Okay, now I'm going to try to send you to an alternate reality. I don't know if it'll vaporize you or not, so you're going to have to confirm to me that you want this."


"If I die, at least I died escaping," I said.


The pain had pretty much lifted entirely. Same with the anxiety. I was even able to move my limbs and head again. Victoria, staring in my direction, squinted her eyes.


"Oh wow…" she said to herself. "Ok, which reality do you want to go to?"


"The furthest normal reality," I said.


"Okay," Victoria whispered to herself.


Everything went blurry, my sense of direction disappeared, and a sense of disorientation hit me. It all felt familiar enough. Next thing I knew, I was standing in a grassy field outlined by trees. The air was the freshest I had ever inhaled. It felt amazing. It was mostly sunny, with shade rolling courtesy of the clouds above. I sprinted up to the road. I took a right. After about an hour of walking, I noticed the silhouette of a city in the distance. I heard the roar of a motor behind me. A circular red car passed by. It was a design I wasn't familiar with. The car pulled over.


A balled man with a rectangular indent in the middle of his face peered out the passenger side. He tossed a rolled up newspaper at me. It hit my shoes. He then closed the passenger side door and drove off. I picked up the newspaper and unfolded it. The image on the front showed a group of people, all of which had similar indents on their faces, holding red and blue flags with triangular symbols on them. In the background were glass buildings and two crystal shaped glass skyscrapers in the distance. All over the paper were lines upon lines of black dots. The header colors were an oddly dark shade of orange, magenta, and a yellow with the dark energy of blue.


This is the farthest normal reality?


At least it's far away from my alternate self, but would I be able to sustain a normal life here? Probably not. Unless English was spoken somewhere.


I continued walking. Some time later, I passed by a glass house with a couple more of those people standing on the porch. They began staring in my direction. They didn't point, they didn't say a word. They must've never seen somebody with a face like mine before. I was in the same boat. I focused back on walking to the city.


As I strolled, I noticed a red moon hovering by. As if it were a satellite or something like that. Can a moon move that fast?


As I neared the city, I passed a light green sign with white dots all over it, along with a six digit line pattern at the bottom. I could only guess I was at the city limits.


Another minute later, three red and orange cars drove up the road in my direction. The one in front pulled up behind me, the one in the back pulled up in front of me. Out came more of those people. They wore blue suits and held large grey devices in their hands. They pointed their devices at me and I felt a numbness occupy my entire body. I collapsed, not feeling anything as I hit the pavement. The people walked up to me. My breaths got heavier with every step they took.


There's no way out of this situation. I'm a monster compared to them. What do I do?


I woke up in a glass cell. There were cells beside, behind, and in front of me. Each one of them had different looking things in them. To my right was a string-like thin swirl being that just moved around in its cell. To my left was a rectangular blur tall enough to reach the ceiling. As I stared at it in confusion, I got goosebumps. It flew in my direction, hitting the glass with a thud. In front of me was a human woman in a fetal position, tears streaming down her face. Behind me was what I thought was an empty cell until I had the realization I should turn away. I however forget exactly why.


A guard or agent walked by pushing a cart with a large camera-like device. She turned the cart, pointing the device's lens towards me. She pushed a button on a remote she had strapped to her waist, then the lens began to light up. Oh no, what's going on here?


I began to shake. A white void surrounded me. It was familiar, like the white light of… portals.


The white light disappeared. The first thing I saw was a sliding door with a view of a city I could vaguely recognize, along with a heavy looming thick fog in the distance. It stood out from the cloudy sky.


Where did that thing take me?


"W-who are you?" a feminine voice asked.


I turned to my left. A woman with a confused expression was sitting on a sofa. I jumped at what she was holding in her hand until I realized it was just the TV remote.


"I-I don't know how I got here," I said.


"Am I going crazy?" the woman asked.


"I was in some cage… now I'm here," I said, knowing how vague that sounded.


"The white light," she said.


She put the TV on. A news reporter's face popped up on the screen.


"The mystery fog has begun to cover Atlanta, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. Internationally, the fog has covered the majority of India, most of the African continent, and has begun to touch China. Still, we don't know why the fog has become so strong and persistent. It's important to mention the video from Mexico that allegedly shows what's going on in the fog is confirmed to be fake. We don't know what's going on in the fog or where expeditions into the fog have disappeared to."


Not this kind of stuff again. A mysterious anti-communication fog? I was curious, but had goosebumps again. I looked out the window and watched as the downtown skyscrapers got swallowed up by the fog.


The fog touched the window. I stood frozen and shaky for a minute, waiting for something to happen.


"The fog has engulfed our studio. We will be providing live coverage of everything we see."


Three staff members ran across the studio, behind him as he looked confused and concerned.


"Um… the-the camera…"


As he stared at the camera, the table creased. Five eyeballs formed along the center. They all glanced around frantically. The reporter kept staring into the camera.


"Are those…"


The reporter went red and bent down in pain, screaming his lungs out. His head inflated a bit, his suit seemingly flailing on its own. What the hell is this? Eyeballs are going to grow out of everywhere?


The lights in the studio went out. All that could be heard were screams until an EAS message popped up.


EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM


THIS IS NOT A TEST


A pit of dread grew in my stomach. I had to get out of there no matter what anyone said. I glanced at ,, , only to see her vanish into thin air. The room shook. The TV and kitchen lights went out, but ,, phone was still on, so it wasn't an EMP… thankfully. My feet began to sink into the floor, as if it were mush. I sprinted to the door, my footsteps getting deeper and deeper. I pulled the door open and stepped onto the hallway floor, which thankfully was still solid. I sprinted down the dark hallway. While I couldn't see anything, that wasn't the worst development. Painful screams echoed in from all directions. They were chilling to say the least. As I came across a wall at the end of the hallway, gunshots echoed from behind me, silencing a few of the screams.


I sped down a staircase, almost being thrown off completely by soft steps. Once I reached the bottom, there were less screams and more gunshots. I ran through the lobby, where three people were crawling on the ground. One of them… it looked like they were being moved by something inside their body. He wasn't moving at his own will. He wasn't breathing either. There was an eyeball on his neck. It was staring at me. I went cold and ran out of the building. The fog was too thick to see anything. I took a step forward. For a split second, I was in a green, yellow, and blue field. I had never seen that much blue in nature before. The air was the freshest I had ever smelled. It was euphoric. Unfortunately, I was there for just a second. Looks like this fog broke reality. I took another step forward and was transported to the field once more for another second.


As I began to feel a rush of euphoria, an echoing sound sent shivers down my spine. I began walking away from it, only to be surrounded by a beach and hit with a numbing nerve exploding heat for a second. I stumbled back in the direction I was stepping in earlier. The field, along with the fresh air returned. Another noise made the ground vibrate. I picked up my pace and the field began to flash again and again. In between the flashes, the dreaded noise shook the ground even more. A sinister heat covered me. I shivered. In desperation, I ran and jumped. Once I hit the ground, I landed face first onto the grass and flowers. I looked up. The sky was partly cloudy and the bluest I've ever seen it being. I took time to smell the flowers as well as that air. There were some smells I didn't recognize. They were all quite euphoric. I must've laid there for too long, as a short man who looked to be in his 30s was standing near me, speaking a language I recognized from my visits to the BC times. This is how our conversation went:


"What are you doing here?" he asked.


"I'm traveling, enjoying nature," I said. "None of your business."


"How long have you been here for?" he asked.


"Only a few minutes," I said. "Not that long."


"What is on your shirt?" he asked, pointing at my shirt.


"That's just the logo of the organization that made this shirt," I said.


"You're so… strange," he said.


My height and clothing were definitely alien to him. For fun I decided to give him a metaphor to pass around to his fellows.


"Say I'm a prophet," I said. "You are the messenger. Follow everything I do because I'm bored, lost, and hungry. Go cure boredom by playing prophet. Tell your people I will reward them for good deeds then promise eternal brutal torture for the ones who don't. At least, I'm assuming you guys are torture happy. It's like 5,000 BC here, at least going by what you're wearing."


"You're a prophet?" he asked.


"It's a metaphor," I said. "The god is a metaphor for inner peace and the… devil is a metaphor for inner suffering or whatever. You're important. Now go spread the word."


He smiled and ran off. I turned around and began walking in the other direction, hoping I'd get somewhere as soon as possible.


It had to have been hours of nonstop walking through grassy fields, dense forests. At no point did I come across a building or any man-made structure. Or a person. Some animals here and there, but not people. It was lonely. Once I got hungry, I once again had to wait. I didn't trust the food of far out there alternate realities, so I had zero known options.


In the middle of a blue sunflower field, my boredom nearly vanished when I came across a hole. When I looked in, it looked like there was a sheet of glass covering the entrance. Down the hole was a gray void with no edges.


Am I really going to jump down a random grey void in the middle of nowhere?


Well, I'd rather be somewhere if not finally my home reality.


I sat down on the edge of the hole, letting my legs dangle. Resting my hands on the grass. I was confused by the look of the void. The portals had their looks. This… was it a portal? Hopefully it was. Was it just a void? Maybe I was in a very different part of the multiverse. I thought I had seen every tiny thing, which was very important in my travels, but I couldn't have.


A man shouted at me from some distance away, though I couldn't make out what he was saying. He was holding a horn. He blew into it, creating a deep fog horn-like sound that echoed all around me. Seconds later, I heard cricket-like chirps coming from every direction. A lot of the flowers in my general vicinity began shaking. I shivered, letting myself slide into the hole.


It felt like I was falling at terminal velocity. I had trouble retaining my breath, but after about a minute of falling, I hit a fuzzy ground that bent down, then up, like a net. Feet in front of me was a hole. I could see tree trunks and grass. I even felt a whiff of air from the hole hit my face. I couldn't bring myself to stand up, so I crawled over to the hole. I climbed into the wilderness. The oxygen smelled… less fresh. I looked behind me and saw the hole was placed along a line-up of giant rocks. My stomach rumbled. There was no time to waste, so I walked into the forest.


As I walked, ten armored people with huge rifles ran towards me while telling me to stand down. A pit formed in my stomach. I got on my knees and held my hands above my head.


"God," I said, shaky and exhausted. "What do you guys want to do with me?"


"Taking Lord Winston's name in vain?" said the man in the center of the group.


I knew they were being sarcastic, but I couldn't help but cringe at armored soldiers talking religion in the middle of what I could only assume was a government mandated mission.


"Come on just tell me," I said.


"Which reality are you from?" he asked.


"One where it was 5000 BC or sometime around then," I said.


"Do you have a device and coordinates?" he asked.


"No," I said. "I just traveled through a slip."


"Are there any differences you can spot in your immediate environment?"


"No," I said. "The grass is the same, the sunflowers are still blue, and the smells… I still can't identify them but they're the same."


The man told me I was going to be brought in for further questioning. Was I going to be here forever? I don't even know if this reality is uncomfortable or not. Although, I was always able to tell through experience whether a reality was dangerous or not almost immediately.


I'll give this reality a chance.


I woke up laying back in a chair in a light grey concrete room with a metal door in front of me. A woman walked in with a handheld device in her right hand. She held it up to me, then she pressed a button. A red scanning beam hit my forehead. After a few seconds, the woman stopped scanning, then a holographic web page popped up in front of my face.


"This is your reality?" she asked.


I read the page over. It had a quick timeline of historical events, a list of common pop culture expressions, an image of our solar system, as well as some government-related events. All of it matched up with our reality. I told the woman it was indeed my home reality, then she tapped the top right corner of the screen, which brought up a map of the world with an orange dot on the eastern part of Virginia, USA. She zoomed in on the dot, which was very close to where I last was in that reality. The woman told me it was my last point in that reality, and that I would be teleported there within the moment. The page disappeared. The woman took out a black device that looked similar to the jumping device I used to have. She pointed it at me, then she pressed a button, opening a portal right at my shoes. I stood up from the chair. Hopeful, I stepped into the portal.


The light surrounded me. I lost my sense of direction, then the light vanished. I was standing in the spot where I last heard the voices of my alternate self and her friends. The trees were the same, the bushes were the same, the patch of grass I pressed flat onto the ground was still flat… I instantly recalled the pain in my neck I felt before waking back up in the Giant Attacks reality. Luckily, I wasn't hearing any voices this time.


Good, I'm home… Now all I need to do is figure out what to do next. Again.
