A pet. We call it that. Feed it, watch it, listen for its breathing beneath us. A pet we don’t understand. A pet we are afraid of. But not feeding it is worse.

Michelle sits on the edge of the bed, her feet over the black. She tilts her head. Listens. Smiles. I think it decides that. Her skin is cold. It’s just storage space. A hatch, a hole, a mouth. Shifting. Spreading.

\---

We packed our things, severed old ties, moved into a small apartment. Living area. Single bedroom. Single bathroom. Just big enough to share. Just small enough to feel confined. Conversations looped. The silence settled in like dust.

A pet, I thought. We should get a pet.

Instead, I found the stories. Not the kind with history. Not the kind with deaths. People swearing their homes were shifting. That the walls had taken on a kind of breath. A presence.

Not ghosts.

Something else.

\---

First the plates. The glasses. A little push, a little shift. Michelle replacing fresh milk with spoiled cartons. My toothbrush damp when I reached for it. Silverware bent at angles I didn’t recognize. We had a rule: for one month, we wouldn’t acknowledge any of it. The game had rules. The game had logic.

The light exploded in my hand.

December 1st. The month was up.

\---

The bed wasn’t where it had been before. A few inches forward, maybe less, just enough to reveal a black-edged gap where the floor should be. If I reached in, my arm would emerge tarred in shadow.

Michelle went to leave. Turned the knob. Stepped back.

I don’t know.

I just felt off for a second. Her pupils were too wide. The pressure in my skull thickened, like the air itself had gained weight. I reached past her. Twisted the knob. The door opened. We weren’t trapped.

Not yet.

\---

A knock. Soft. Deliberate. One knuckle against wood. I unlatched the chain and cracked the door open. No one. But if I shut the door too soon, whoever knocked would slip away unseen.

Michelle sighed. “Then close it.”

A breath of cold air touched my skin.

\---

“It wants something else.” Michelle’s voice, thick with sleep. Pressing a photo into my hand. Torn edges. A memory halved. I don’t think it’s just hungry, she said. I think it’s collecting.

She dropped the photo in. It was accepted.

“See?” she whispered. “It’s easy.”

\---

The electrician arrived at noon. Here for the lights, he said. His posture was slightly off—too still, too measured, like someone who had practiced standing naturally. He set his toolbox on the table. The clasp wouldn’t open. His fingers spasmed against the latch. Tap-snap. Tap-snap. A metronome of metal and bone, syncing with the faint knocking against the pipes, against the mirror.

“You’ll know what to do when the time comes,” he said.

Then he walked into my bedroom.

The bed creaked. Fabric shifted. A metallic rasp against the carpet. A slow, deliberate groan of hinges.

When I stepped inside, he was gone. But the bed had moved.

\---

We tested it. Tape measure, thread. No bottom to it. Just emptiness.

We fed it. The plate. The wedding ring. The picture. It stopped taking food. It wanted more.

We lost days. Time skipped. Conversations repeated in new phrasing. The same movements, same patterns, same sighs. Michelle watched me, head tilted. Her smile just a little too slow.

“You’re adjusting,” she said.

\---

The hatch has grown. Half an inch by half an inch. Then a full inch. Then two. It is still growing.

How much bigger?

I think it decides that.

\---

The walls shift when we aren’t looking. A breath in the drywall, the bones of the apartment settling deeper—reshaping. Michelle’s fingers drift over the mattress. "I think it decides that."

I open my mouth to speak, but the words have already been spoken. The words are already gone.

The first meal was accepted. Then another. Then my ring. We measured the hatch. It had grown. I measured the hatch. It had always been growing. Michelle ran a thumb over the photograph, the edges curling inward like fingers digesting. "I don’t think it’s just hungry. I think it’s collecting."

\---

The apartment is a closed loop. I see myself in the mirror, but my reflection stays longer than I do. Steam thickens, swallows the words. L I G H T B U—

Michelle calls it an experiment. I call it something else. The food stopped working. We had to start giving it more. The hatch refused the chicken. The hatch refused the silverware. The hatch refused the photographs. The hatch refused the bed. The hatch refused the time.

A knock. One knuckle against wood. Not the door. Not the walls. The sound from inside the floor. A pulse beneath us, dull and patient. The knocking moves closer each night. We sleep next to it. We feed it. We adjust.

"You’re adjusting," Michelle says. Her voice is unfamiliar. Her voice is a stretched recording, warping at the edges.

\---

The electrician yawned. Too wide. Too slow. His teeth weren’t teeth, but different, segmented. "You’ll know what to do when the time comes."

\---

Michelle stands at the threshold. Her pupils are darker now, her hands trembling over the edge of the hatch. "Maybe we just never noticed it before." But we did. We did. We did. The tape measure unspools into black. No bottom. No sound. No return.

I lost two days. Michelle says I was here the whole time. The air is heavier now, thick with waiting. "What do you want to give up?" she asks. Like the hatch is doing us a favor. Like it’s sifting through the weight of what we don’t need. Like it knows better.

The knocking stops.

It is replaced.

The hatch is still growing.

\---

The knocking woke me. The knocking woke me. The knocking woke me. Not the door. Inside the walls. Rhythmic. Deliberate.

I strained to listen, pulse sluggish from the antihistamines. 3 AM. The light was off. We left it on. We always leave it on.

The farthest corner where the walls meet. Paint splitting like old skin. I knew before I touched it. Soft. Wet. Blinking. A single pinpricked pupil, watching.

I stepped back.

It peeled.

A slow curling motion, damp wood sloughing flesh, revealing—

I don’t remember the rest. Heat. A pulse that wasn’t mine. Silence stretched too long.

Then the knocking stopped.

\---

It’s not a crawlspace.

It’s not a pet.

It is still growing.

Michelle said we should stop before it gets too big. But how big is too big? Too big for what? Too big for us? Too big to contain? Too big to feed?

The walls feel softer. The apartment exhales when we step inside.

Everything shifted overnight. I found a hole behind the couch. Tiny. Pinpricked. Like a knothole in old wood. I looked through it.

It looked back.

I dream in knots of muscle and wet breath. The floor drags when I walk. The door doesn’t close right. I place my hand against the wall and feel a push back.

Michelle doesn’t seem to notice anymore. She smiles in the dark, teeth catching the light. “It’s fine,” she whispers. “We just have to give it what it wants.”

I ask her what it wants.

She tilts her head, listening.

And the walls shudder like lungs filling with air.

\---

GROWTH ESCALATION ALTERED STATES THE OPENING UNEXPLAINED FIRST MANIFESTATIONS

A construct. A room in the mind.

Michelle's hands hovering above the hatch. My hands pressed into soft walls. The room shifting, curling, breathing. The first knock. The first whisper. A cabinet door flinging open—

Michelle's wedding ring vanishing.

We had been together for years. The bed moved. The walls widened. The hatch waited.

I ran my fingers along the wood, measuring, marking. It grew. Always.

A pulse beneath my palm, a dark thread unraveling. The hatch was not empty. It was not hollow.

It was feeding.

Michelle whispered to it. I watched. I did not interfere.

We were feeding it, yes, but we had been feeding it long before we found it.

The walls had already shifted. The light had already warped.

The apartment had never been ours.

The first meal. A plate slid forward, vanishing. No sound. No fall. Just gone.

The electrician said, "You'll know what to do."

The mirror fogged. Words written by hands that were not mine.

I stepped closer. The hatch yawned wider.

We sat at the kitchen table, eating breakfast. The knocking came. A cold breath across my skin. Michelle did not flinch.

She was waiting for it. Expecting it.

"How much bigger?" I whispered.

Michelle smiled. "It decides that."

She dropped into the hatch—

A photo. A ring. A thought. A memory.

The apartment folded inward. The tape measure unraveled.

There was no bottom.

It had never been empty.

It had never been waiting.

It had been growing. And it was still growing.

The walls soften. The hatch opens.

I reach inside.

It accepts me.

\---

Knocking came soft at first. Somewhere inside. Behind walls, under floorboards, in the blood-thread seams of the apartment.

Michelle stirred but did not wake. I lay beside her, skin pressed tight against a world too small. Stale air pooled in my lungs. My body sank. The apartment breathed out, pulling me deeper.

A voice through the walls. Not speech. Not sound. A slow, creaking flex of pressure, stretching the space we lived in. I rolled onto my side, feeling my weight shift, waiting for the apartment to settle back—but it didn’t. It held. Suspended. A waiting pause.

I moved my lips, but no words came. They didn’t need to. The apartment already knew.

A knock. Closer this time. The walls pulsed. Life behind them, pushing, pressing through layers of paint, plaster, time.

Michelle exhaled in her sleep, voice catching in the space between dream and waking.

The light flickered. Dimmed. Skinned itself raw in the wiring. The air grew dense with the smell of ozone.

I pressed a hand to the mattress. The pulse came from below now. Slow. Patient. The hatch had opened wider.

There was no furniture now. No objects. Just space. The apartment, stripped to its ribs, stretching wider than the building allowed. The floor no longer met the walls. The walls no longer met the ceiling. Just distance, expanding, an aperture widening in the skin of the world.

Michelle opened her eyes, but they weren’t hers. A deep red pinprick flickered at the center, wide and unblinking. She smiled.

“We need to feed it.”

I nodded. We both knew what came next.

\---

The hatch yawns wider. It is not a hole. It is a mouth. A wound. A thought split open scattering like insects under a flickering bulb. Michelle whispers things in her sleep, but she is not asleep. I see my own hands move before I feel them, reaching into the black, fingers sinking past the surface like they’ve always belonged.

The walls pulse with a slow, breathless rhythm. Not alive, not dead—in between, dreaming itself into being. The furniture shifts, pressing outward, rearranging itself in configurations that almost make sense. I find a chair where there was no chair. A door where there was no door. I open it, and the apartment is still here. But different. Stretched. Warped.

Michelle is in the kitchen, standing too still. Her head tilts slightly, as though listening to the floor.

She turns to me.

“You’re adjusting,” she says.

I don’t ask what that means. I don’t need to.

There is a knocking sound, but it is not from the walls. Not from the hatch. It is coming from behind my eyes.

I press my hands to my face, trying to steady myself, trying to hold myself inside my own skin.

The hatch pulses. The apartment breathes. The knocking continues.

It’s trying to get out.

Do I let it?
