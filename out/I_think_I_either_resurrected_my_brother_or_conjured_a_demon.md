It had only been a week since my brother died. I thought I would have given anything to bring him back… now I'm not so sure.

Only days after his body was found, I was in Ian's apartment, cleaning out his stuff.

If I could’ve waited another month, another *year*, I would have. Every item I looked at brought back a memory of the times we’d shared. But the lease was up at the end of the month, and no one could afford to keep paying for the place.

What made the whole experience worse was that we never really got any answers about what happened.

He’d gone a few days without answering calls. One of his friends stopped by to check on him and found his body on the bedroom floor.

The autopsy came back clean. No drugs, no trauma. By all accounts, Ian was a healthy, happy twenty-eight-year-old. He should’ve been alive for decades.

But he wasn’t.

And now I was sifting through his life, trying to keep it together.

Most of it was routine—kitchen items, paperwork, food. My task was to get as much into the garbage as possible. Our parents didn't live nearby, but they rented a small storage container for the stuff we wanted to keep. Too small, in my opinion. The process was going as well as it could have until I reached the bedroom. Every item I touched in there felt personal, like pieces of him were still present within those walls.

By the time I reached his desk, I was emotionally tapped out. I opened the top drawer expecting the usual junk—pens, receipts, maybe a notebook.

Instead, there was just one thing.

A phone.

Not a modern one, but an old flip phone—the kind we used to think were so cool back in high school. It was one of those RAZR phones, but… different. The surface wasn’t plastic or metal. It looked and felt like *stone*.

It was heavy, cold.

I flipped it open, expecting it to be dead, but the screen flickered to life.

And there, staring back at me, was a new message notification.

From **Ian**.

My breath caught. It had to be a joke. Or maybe some other Ian. Lots of people had that name, no?

But I opened the message and read:

"I’m so glad you found this. I know it’s hard to believe, but it’s me, Ian."

I stared at the screen, heart hammering.

This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real.

Still, my thumbs moved before I could stop them.

"Prove it."

A minute passed. Then another. Just as I was about to put the phone down, it buzzed again.

"Remember the bottle of gin we stole from Dad’s liquor cabinet when you were in ninth grade? No one knew about that but me. Or how about last year, when you called me after you cheated on Molly? Have you told anyone else about that?"

My blood ran cold.

No one—*no one*—knew those things except Ian.

It had to be him. Somehow, impossibly, it was him.

I could barely breathe. I typed back one word.

"How?"

"I’m not really dead. Not fully. I think there’s a way to bring me back."

Before I could reply, a warning popped up on the screen.

**Very low. Recharge now?**

It was a question… I searched the phone for a charging port, but found none. Confused, I selected *yes* on the prompt.

The phone clicked, and pain shot through my hand. I dropped it, blood dripping from a small wound on my palm.

“What the hell?” I whispered.

I turned the phone over. Searching for a sharp edge that may have caused the cut.

*Razr indeed,* I thought

After examining the back and edges of the phone, I returned my attention to the screen.

**Please hold the phone firmly.**

A loud, high-pitched beep filled the room. Against my better judgment, I placed the phone on my wounded palm.

Then… **Battery charged.**

When I looked down at my hand, the wound was already scabbing over. And the message screen was available once again.

Ignoring the pain, I texted him back, no longer settling for short replies.

"What is going on? How did you die? How am I talking to you right now? And what do you mean you can come back?"

His text came back almost instantly.

"Chris, I’m not entirely sure how I died. There’s a lot I still don’t remember. But talking to you helps. It’s like it wakes something up in me. Please—keep texting. It’s dark here. I’m scared."

"Can you tell me *anything*?" I asked. "Just help me understand!"

"The phone somehow connects me to the living world. I remember finding it when I was alive, but never figured it out. I think… I wasn’t supposed to use it then. It was meant for you."

The phone flashed again.

**Low battery. Recharge now?**

I didn’t even hesitate this time.

The pain ripped through my hand again.

**Charging complete.**

I texted right away, trying to stay calm.

How do we get you back?

I think you’re already doing it. Every few messages, I feel something changing. I remember more. I feel… stronger.

I wasn’t sure if he knew about how the phone was *charged.* But I had a sinking suspicion that my blood and his strength were connected.

We kept texting for twenty minutes straight. Each time the battery drained, I recharged—alternating hands, the skin on my palms raw and stinging.

I was too eager to be talking to Ian to really question what was happening.

Until the final recharge. Something was different. The phone itself was vibrating gently in my hand, as if it were anticipating something.

That’s when I paused.

What was I actually doing? Could anything that requires blood to operate be good?

I set the phone down. Just to see what would happen.

The screen buzzed, new messages piling up behind the recharge prompt. I couldn’t read them.

Then, for the first time, I heard a *voice.*

“Chris, are you there?”

Ian’s voice.

“I’m here!” I shouted. “I’m here!”

“Whatever you’re doing—it’s working. I can feel it. I think you’re bringing me back.”

“Where are you, Ian? What’s happening?”

“I don’t know,” he said, his voice breaking. “It’s dark. I can’t focus. Just keep going. Please. We’re close.”

My hand hovered above the phone.

“Chris, please,” he said again. “It’s dark in here. I’m scared. *Please.* Get me out.”

My resolve cracked.

“Screw it,” I muttered.

I picked up the phone and hit *Yes*.

The pain was immediate—but different.

The phone grew hot. So hot it seared my palm.

Steam hissed off its surface as I threw it onto the floor.

The screen went black. The body of the phone glowed red—brighter and brighter—as the rest of the room began to *dim.*

The all the lights from outside the window vanished. The moon, the streetlights—everything went dark.

The only light in my vision was that red glow from the phone.

Then it started to *vibrate.*

Something shifted above it, like a shadow or smoke coalescing midair.

The glowing red silhouette pulsed, flickering. The air grew cold. I pressed myself against the wall to get as far away as possible from whatever was happening. But also… my eyes stayed glued to whatever was taking shape before me.

The light dimmed further until I was left in total blackness. Total silence… the only sound, my own heartbeat pounding in my chest..

Then...

I felt a cold, almost wet pressure on my shoulder.

“You did it, Chris.”

Ian’s voice.

But wrong.

It was like two voices were speaking through one mouth. One of them was Ian's, the other sent a shudder down my spine.

“This wouldn’t have been possible without you.”

I wanted to run. I wanted to scream. But I couldn’t move.

“All that’s left,” the voice said, “is to find *his—* I mean, *my* body.”

And then—silence.

The lights flicked back on.

Everything was exactly where it had been.

Except for the phone.

It was gone.

All that remained was a small pile of ash, smoldering on the floor.

Maybe my brother *was* in that phone somehow… But I'm afraid *something else* was there [as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/MattBenjamin/).
