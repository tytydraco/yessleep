The council flat next to mine has been empty since I moved in three months ago. No one coming or going. No bins out. No lights on. The housing officer said it was under refurbishment.

But last week, I heard someone crying through the wall.

It was soft at first—like someone trying not to cry. Not sobbing, not wailing. Just these quiet, miserable gulps of air. It came from the bedroom wall, the one I share with the vacant flat.

At first I thought maybe I was imagining it. I hadn’t been sleeping well. You don’t, in this building. Radiators click all night. Pipes rattle like bones. You hear your neighbour’s dog fart.

But the crying kept happening. Around 2 a.m. every night. Always in the same place, like she was curled up against the other side of the wall. I say she because it was a woman’s voice. Young. Heartbroken.

I didn’t report it. I just listened.

That was the mistake.

On the fourth night I finally knocked on the wall. Just once.

The crying stopped instantly. Not faded—stopped. Like someone hit pause.

I held my breath.

And then—

*tap-tap-tap.*

Three knocks. Back at me. Right where I’d knocked.

I laughed, because it was easier than panicking. I said, out loud, *“Hey. You okay?”*

Silence.

Then: a whisper. Muffled. Croaky.

*“Please help me. Please.”*

I pressed my ear to the wall. The plaster was cold.

*“I’m stuck,”* the voice said. *“They walled me in.”*

My chest got tight. I thought maybe she was hallucinating. Off her meds. Maybe the flat wasn’t empty and the housing officer got it wrong.

I called the emergency line. They told me 2B was vacant, sealed for asbestos, no one’s been assigned. Said they’d send someone out next day.

But when they came, the key didn’t fit the lock.

The entire flat was sealed shut. Door painted over. Handle rusted stiff. The contractor tried to force it and the knob came off in his hand. He said it felt like the flat didn’t want to be opened.

They left. Said they’d file a maintenance request.

That night, the crying was louder. Almost frantic.

*“You tried,”* the voice said. *“No one ever tries.”*

I said, *“Who are you?”*

She said nothing. Just scratched at the wall. Over and over. Until I fell asleep to the sound of her fingernails clawing against the plaster.

Three nights ago, I woke up to my bedroom light already on.

*I don’t sleep with it on.*

There were lines on the wall. Long, pale scrapes like something was dragging a coin through the paint from the other side.

I touched one. My fingertip came away with dust and blood.

I didn’t go to work that day. I just sat at the edge of the bed and waited. Around 1:47 a.m., she returned.

Only this time she wasn’t crying.

She was laughing.

It started quiet. Breathless. But it built. A soft, giddy giggle that rose into shrieking laughter, pressing right up against the wall like she was inches away. Like she could feel how scared I was.

I covered my ears and yelled, ***“STOP IT!”***

She stopped.

Then whispered, so close I swear her breath fogged the plaster:

*“Let me in.”*

••

I haven’t slept since.

I see things now—movement in reflections. Smiles where there shouldn’t be. The wall is wet some mornings, like it’s sweating.

Last night I found something under my pillow.

A tooth. Human. Yellowed. The root still wet.

The wall had more scratches—only this time they spelled something. A word: **SOON.**

And today, there was a knock at my front door.

A girl stood there. Early twenties, white hoodie, tangled hair. Pale as dust. She looked like she’d been dragged out of a lake. Her lips moved but no sound came out. I said, *“Who are you?”*

She pointed to the bedroom wall.

Then she smiled.

I slammed the door and locked it. But when I ran back to the bedroom—more scratches. This time: ALMOST.

••

Tonight is different.

She’s not crying, not laughing. She’s talking.

Telling me about the man who lived in 2B before. How he fed her through the wall. Left food at the skirting board where a crack ran between flats. How he left a bowl of milk like she was a stray. How he let her through eventually.

She says he screamed for days. No one heard.

*She says she’s still hungry.*

The wall is cracking now. I can hear the plaster breaking like thin ice. I see movement. Fingers. Long and grey, feeling along the seam. No nails. Just bloodied nubs. Wrinkled and wet. Like something that’s never seen daylight.

I don’t think I can stop her.

She keeps saying my name now. Not a whisper. Full voice. Cheerful. Friendly.

*“Come on, let me out. I’m your friend. You’ve been so kind.”*

I’ve nailed a towel to the wall. Taped over it. Doesn’t help. I hear her chewing now. Something crunching—bone, maybe.

I don’t think the wall’s going to hold.

If you live in a flat with a sealed room next door, listen closely.

*If you hear crying—don’t knock.*
*If she speaks to you—don’t answer.*
*And if she ever laughs—*

***Move.***
