Funnily enough, I never believed in the supernatural up until a couple months ago. Hell, part of me *still* doesn’t believe in it, even with the things I’ve seen. 

For example: just this past week the division detained its first mermaid. Correction, sorry, *siren*. The two entities absolutely loathe being mistaken for the other. 

I’m still new to the job and am in the process of learning to disregard everything the media has told me. So if any Elders are reading this, I truly meant no disrespect. 

For those of you that aren’t aware of who Elders are, well, they’re elder. Beings that inhabited the Earth way before we came along. Some places around the world have different names for them: Fae, Sidhe, Neighbors, Diwata, Yōsei, Dokkaebi. Around these parts of Winchester, Michigan though, we call ‘em Elders. 

The very first thing I was taught is that long ago, us humans pushed them out of the lands they once ruled, so the least we can do is be respectful towards them. 

Thankfully, I’ve yet to encounter a real nasty Elder. I hear things can get pretty ugly if you upset one well enough. These beings can be quite powerful, seeing as Elders can harness and tap into an ethereal energy that is invisible and mostly inaccessible to us- magic (no I’m not shitting you, magic is real). 

Elders are also very clever and can look like anyone or anything whenever they want. You never know when you might unsuspectingly engage in a conversation with someone that is eons older than they look. So, as a reminder, respect everyone. *Especially* your Elders!

Getting back to our latest catch (pun intended), she was a real pain in the ass to track down. It’s not often you come across a fresh water siren. They’re more difficult to deal with seeing as they can go from one body of water to another. Sure the oceans are big, but in the event a siren comes ashore to feed, they tend not to stray far from the salty sea. It’s a completely different beast when your suspect can travel pretty much anywhere on land as long as there’s a fresh water source nearby. 

Our Lieutenant personally requested that Detective Dustin Davidson, my partner, and I bring our fish friend in after a news segment about local missing men aired. The only thing left of them were their empty wallets- which had been found either by a creek, river, or in one instance, a pool. 

In the segment the reporter also interviewed an old man who claimed to be a victim that survived his brush with the party responsible. There was a large bandage on his cheek and he had a pretty bad black eye. He definitely survived something alright.

The next two minutes of the broadcast consisted of a detailed rant about him encountering a luscious looking she-devil with claws, razor-sharp teeth, and a glimmering green fish tail in a pond while on his evening hike at a local trail. Poor guy had accidentally stumbled upon a feeding session. Siren’s are known to be territorial and very protective of their feeding grounds, kinda like resource guarding with dogs.  Seeing him as a threat, the “she-devil” lunged out of the water and attacked him, screeching out a horrible song as she did. 

He only got away because her prey in the water was still alive and started trying to run. The siren wanted her meal more, so she hissed at him then slithered back into the water to finish what she started. When he went back the next day, the only evidence he found that proved something had happened was a man’s empty wallet sitting by the edge of the pond.

Our survivor reported the incident to the authorities, but our counterparts didn’t believe him and called the guy a crackhead. Those lazy fuckers didn’t even bother to file a report. If they had, the case would’ve been flagged and sent directly to our division where we could start an investigation immediately. But, because this didn’t happen, and we found out from the news,  Lieutenant Dawn was pretty pissed. 

A guy ranting about lunatic mermaids on tv wasn’t exactly a good look for us. You see, civilians and the other half of Winchester PD don’t know that our division exists. The division’s purpose is to bring in supernatural perpetrators that make a lot of noise. We want to keep the general public from getting suspicious about the things that go bump in the night being real. The expression “ignorance is bliss” is an expression for a reason. 

Anyway, the news crew probably included that interview as an attention getter to the case, dismissing his testimony all together and deeming him insane. But to us in the know, he gave us valuable information and a great tip. Now we knew what creature to look for. The fish tail and horrid singing were telltale signs of a siren.

“Davidson, Rookie,” Lieutenant Dawn addressed Dustin and I after the segment ended, “track down our witness and get a proper statement. Then get a profile on our siren. We need to bring her in before she causes us even more trouble. The last thing we need are some siren hunters snooping around.”

“Yes, sir.” Dustin and I nodded in unison, graciously accepting the assignment. It had been a slow day and we were eager to catch some action. Not even twenty minutes later we were leaving to speak with our witness, Paulie Rutledge. 

Dustin grabbed his coat off his office chair then shot me a devious grin as he put it on. “Ready to go, *Rookie?*”

With a huff and roll of my eyes, I grabbed the rest of my things and walked off. I hate being called rookie. It’s so stupid because that’s what I am and he was just trying to be playful, but at my old department it was used derogatorily and wasn’t a good thing to be called. Plus being called a rookie brings up bad memories…

My therapist says I should try to reclaim the word, and I’m trying my best to, but as of now you can call me Lucky. She also said it might help me process my trauma a little better if I kept a diary. So think of this as a two for one special. I get to vent to the internet *and* make my job a little easier by giving life-saving advice on any supernatural’s that might cross your path. 

“Officer Hale,” Dawn stopped me on my way out of the precinct, whispering in my ear, “prove them wrong.  Show me you’re a good cop. Show me why I recruited you.”

My body went rigid. “Y-yes sir,” I barely managed to stumble out. He pat my shoulder firmly and shot me a reassuring smile. Dawn left as soon as Dustin caught up with me. The two of us then left the precinct without saying much about the encounter. I could see he wanted to pry but left it alone instead. I appreciated that.

When we interviewed Mr. Rutledge, he said the same thing as before. 

Paulie was on his evening stroll on a local trail when he heard a woman’s hums and intense splashing coming from the pond. Concerned, he went off-trail to see if he could help. That’s when he spotted the siren and she attacked him. 

The good news is he was able to give us a better description other than the one on the news. Right before she jumped out of the water and revealed her true terrifying siren features, Paulie said the woman had pale skin, long curly black hair, hypnotic blue eyes, and a tattoo of an anchor right above her right collarbone. 

Armed with that new description, Dustin and I got ready to leave. But before we could, Paulie asked if we believed him since we were there following up on his account. He looked at us with a glimmer in his eye, happy that somebody was finally listening to him. 

Dustin straight up told him no. Said we were doing a mandatory routine follow up, and if he was being honest with himself, the visit had been a complete waste of everyone’s time. All the while, I stood behind Dustin with my lips pressed shut. Our parting words with the man were to stay off the drugs or the next time we came back it wouldn’t be pretty. The last thing I saw as the front door closed were Paulie’s soul crushed eyes on the brink of tears.

Needed to take a breather after that. I had almost bitten my tongue off back there. 

“It’s all part of the job,” Dustin reminded me, gripping the steering wheel of his brown ‘78 Corolla liftback, staring blankly into the distance. “It sucks, but it’s a necessary evil.” Clearly it had affected him too, judging by how white his knuckles were. 

Pulling out into the street, he turned the dial on his radio and an old rock song came on. Dustin happily hummed along as we drove, energetically tapping on the steering wheel along to the beat.

It was almost uncanny the way he could switch from his usual happy-go-lucky self to bitterly ice cold in an instant. It freaked me out, but being dually personable and serious *are* good qualities to have in a detective. 

Back at the precinct, we started putting a case file together. Here’s what we knew about our siren: she was young and beautiful looking (all siren’s are), she had long curly black hair, and a distinctive tattoo of an anchor on her collarbone. And, for some reason this one *really* liked snacking on unfaithful men. That’s what our profiler, Jane, said anyway. She gathered all that after sifting through the files we pulled on the missing men. 

Friend and loved one testimonies weren’t worth shit, unfortunately. Jane only figured out the siren’s type after hacking into one of our bachelor’s phone records. And before anyone says anything, since we’re an unknown legal entity, the supernatural’s division is like the Wild West out here. Pretty much anything goes. Including magically aided hacking. Did I mention Jane was a witch?

Text messages between our bachelor and his friends revealed that our siren had matched with him on a dating site. The kicker? He had a girlfriend he was about to propose to. This guy wanted one last hurrah before tying the knot. *Yeah.* 

According to him, the siren’s profile said she was a singer. And judging by some provocative messages I will not be providing here, a bombshell with a great personality. 

Our bachelor and the siren talked for a few hours before she proposed they met up, an offer which Mr. Horndog readily obliged. Before the pair met up though, he told his friend all about the woman he was about to meet up with. And of course said friend didn’t want to say anything when the report was filed, because as he put it in one of his texts, “bro’s before ho’s.” 

After Jane cross referenced the other victim’s records with Bachelor one’s, she proved her hunch right. All the men that had gone missing were rich players looking to cheat on their partners. 

With a description, hunting ground, and an ideal victim profile, we were ready to get to work. The plan to catch our siren was simple. We were going to set up a honey trap. 

Being bait was out of the question for me. I’m single and have boobs. That meant Dustin would be our lure, a role he was fine with undertaking. It didn’t take long for the siren to match with Dustin’s fake profile. After all, we knew what likes of hers to cater to. After an impromptu photo shoot, we had some good looking photos of Dustin looking wealthy with his hands posed showing a wedding band on his finger. 

Audra was the alias she was going by this time around. The siren’s M.O was matching with her victim on whatever dating app, chatting and building a good rapport with them, then luring her prey out somewhere that was near the water never to be seen again. Once she was full and had taken all his cash, she’d unmatch with the poor sap and delete her profile before starting the cycle all over again a couple days later with a new name.

This is why it was a top priority to bring Audra in. If she was out killing men every couple of days, it was purely for sport. Sirens typically only hunt when it’s absolutely necessary. 

We knew we’d found our siren based off her profile pictures. Audra was stunning and could pass for a model. She glowed in every picture. The photo that gave us the positive ID was one of her at the beach in a red bikini. The great lake behind her sparkled, basking her in a glow that made her shine like a goddess. Peeking just behind her top’s strap was a little ship anchor. 

Dustin sent the first message. It was a corny pick up line. Audra sent back a quippy response asking him if that line ever worked. He asked if it did on her. She replied yes.

She’s the one that suggested they meet up. Dustin entertained the idea but played hard to get. He brought up having plans later that he just couldn’t miss, alluding to his fake wife. That was a good move on his part because after that Audra got really interested in going out with him. 

Dustin led her on for a bit before finally accepting the invitation. We let her pick the location. A bar that was a quick five minute walk away from Winchester beach on the shore of Lake Erie. She wanted to meet him there at eight pm. Siren’s are like sharks and do their hunting at night.

Of course he wasn’t going to meet up with Audra alone. I was going to follow them wherever they went. Dustin’s job was to get her to a secure spot on the beach where I’d set up shop with a high frequency sonar gun and a spotlight to stun her long enough for him to cuff her. Just like they use sound to hurt us, sound can be used to hurt sirens if the decibel is right. And because their eyes are extremely sensitive in the dark, a strong, bright flash of light can temporarily blind them, buying valuable time. 

But no matter what, we couldn’t let her get into the water. Siren’s are shifters and they’re pretty hard to take down as it is while on land. We’d die before getting the chance to bring her in if she were at full strength in her natural habitat- where she was at the top of the food chain.

Dustin left for the bar first, with me carefully tailing behind him. He’d slicked his auburn hair back with some gel and was wearing his classy business attire. Detective Davidson definitely looked like a rich asshole. Albeit a handsome rich asshole. 

Audra seemed to buy the charade. When they met at the bar she lit up like a firework, ogling over him and tracing her fingers on his skin seductively. Those pictures didn’t do her any justice, she looked even more beautiful in person. Her hair was pinned up into a perfect messy bun and she wore an expensive long white dress with red flowers all over. A scandalous slit revealed everything below the top of her thigh. 

I spied on the two of them from the passenger seat of my car as they laughed and drank with each other. 

Dustin was careful to sip his drinks sparingly, but played a very convincing drunk. He set the plan in motion after his second drink, sending me a text letting me know they were about to be on the move. 

I pulled out of my parking spot and drove down the road, closer to the beach. I had a better vantage point there with a good view of the bar and the walkway down to the water. A couple minutes later I had eyes on Dustin and Audra as they came stumbling out of the bar.

I got worried when she abruptly dragged him into a corner store by the bar. I was about ready to hop out, guns blazing, when they finally re-emerged with a white grocery bag and a bottle of booze. She was trying to get him as inebriated as possible- less of a fight that way. 

Back out in the open, Dustin looked just as relieved as I did.

The pair made their way over to the walkway that led to the beach, laughing and holding hands. In another life Dustin could’ve been an actor with how well he was pulling off this performance.

Discreetly I exited my vehicle, grabbed my equipment, and stalked along the tall grass towards our rendez-vu point. My earplugs and noise cancelling headphones went on once I’d set up the spot light. This was to prevent her song from influencing me or damaging my ears. I wish Dustin could’ve had some protection on him down there but then he ran the risk of being compromised.
Like a sniper, I trained my eye on Audra, ready to pull the trigger if she even *looked* like she would try to sing her song to Dustin. 

I watched as she slipped off her dress, revealing the same red bikini from the photo. She posed for Dustin before jumping up and down a couple of times while pointing at the water. She then grabbed his wrists, trying to pull him in with her. I tightened my grip on the trigger when he pulled back, digging his feet in the sand. He was trying to keep her from getting in the water. Audra looked displeased, her hands still on his wrists.

“Something about this smells fishy,” I mumbled under my breath. The look on Dustin’s face made me uneasy. Audra’s demeanor seemed to change as she was spoke. It didn’t look like she was singing, but whatever she was saying had urked him.

Then, doing the dumbest thing in my career so far, I took off the headphones and ear plugs. 

“I know you’re out there. Come out, I want to see you!” Audra yelled in a sing-song voice, stroking a sharp nail beneath Dustin’s chin. 

Shit. *He’d been made.*

I didn’t reveal myself and kept quiet. Dustin did the same.

After a moment, Audra broke the silence “Fine have it your way.” She pursed her lips and started singing. 

The spot light flashed faster than a bolt of lightning. Audra’s song was interrupted by her pained screams as she shielded her eyes, giving me enough time to get down to the beach.

Regaining herself, Audra screeched at Dustin. The shrill sound of her voice knocked him on his knees. A particularly sour note rang out, causing him to pass out.

I took the sonar gun and shot a pulse at her. The first blast neutralized her song. Then the next one knocked her back away from the water. If she escaped she’d have her pick of five Great Lakes that had access to two separate countries. Couldn’t have that.
Audra was so disoriented after the second pulse, she fell and hit her head on a rock. 

The next three rounds I shot in rapid succession just for good measure.

Panic gripped my chest as I went back to examine Dustin. He was unconscious, pale, and his nose and ears were bleeding.

I couldn’t go through this. *Not again.*

I looked for anything that could be used to wake him up. My eyes spotted the white grocery bag from the corner store. Rifling through it, I found an ice cold water bottle.

“Get up!” I yelled, dumping most of the contents on his face. I chucked the bottle behind me as my palm connected with his cheek. “I said get up!”

With a roaring start, Dustin came back to life. He sat up taking deep gasping breaths, rubbing his sore cheek. 

Relief flooded through me as I blinked tears away. “Are you okay?”

Dustin gave me a short nod before the wind was knocked out of me. Something had tackled me from the side. My head bashed against the packed sand as the siren threw me to the ground. 

Audra had me pinned on my back, the full weight of her tail pressing down on my chest. She wrapped her clawed hands around my throat and started to squeeze. Her black, soulless eyes stared into mine as she licked her lips hungrily.

How had she transformed? She was nowhere near the water. I managed to looked to my side near where Audra had fallen earlier.  Rolling around in the wind was an empty plastic bottle. 

*The god damned water bottle.* How could I have been so stupid, made such a rookie mistake?!

I struggled to breathe as the siren started to crush my windpipe like it was nothing. Digging my nails into her face and wrists didn’t seem to do anything.

“You smell delicious~” Audra whispered in a hum as she licked the skin by my ear. She took a deep breath in, savoring my scent, causing chills to run down my spine.

A choked gasp left my mouth as stars started to dot my vision. A tear slipped past my water line. A clawed finger picked it up before it could disappear forever. Audra’s finger made a popping sound around her lips as she lapped it up like a greedy puppy. She giggled, opening her mouth to eat my face off. “Your tears taste just as powerful as-“

*Squelch!*

Audra released her death grip on me as her breath hitched in her throat. I followed her eyes down to her shaking hands which were covered in blood. Bulging out of her stomach was the end of a metallic projectile. She shifted back to human as her body went limp from the sheer amount of blood loss. I’m pretty sure I cracked a rib when the full weight of her body collapsed on top of me. 

Standing behind the passed out siren was Dustin, with the other half of the weapon in his hand. The moonlight illuminated him and it well.

“A harpoon? Where the hell did you get a harpoon?!” I asked incredulously, harshly shoving Audra off me in the process.

Dustin stood there, panting heavily. He pointed to a lifeguard station behind him. “Over there.” 

Overcome with exhaustion and just grateful to be alive, I burst out laughing. After a minute Dustin chuckled with me, lifting the limp siren’s body off the ground. 

She let out a low moan as Dustin double cuffed her and hauled her over his shoulder. He then stuck his hand out to help me up. Together we carried the siren back to his car. 

Albeit bruised and banged up from this sting, we got the siren back to the precinct with everyone mostly in one piece. She would receive medical attention and get that harpoon arrow removed. But after that, our friend Audra would be sent to a secure, soundproof, cell where she will be spending the rest of her days.

Moral of the story here? Siren’s are gold diggers and don’t trust pretty women that can sing (I’m pretty sure Taylor Swift is a siren btw but nobody here has yet to give me confirmation).

I’m still pretty shaken up by the whole thing, considering I almost died. Lieutenant Dawn ordered that I take a couple days off to rest for the rib and everything. My neck is  still pretty stiff, bruised, and swollen. Every time I close my eyes and drift off to sleep, her face jump scares me, like a nightmare. My mind is trying to convince my body it was just that, a nightmare. But Audra, she was real.
Her words were real too, and they are constantly echoing in the back of my mind…

I go back tomorrow though. 

Everyone is required to work the Halloween shift. It’s the busiest day of the year for the division, so all hands are on deck.
 
As the big day draws near, all the crazies are starting to come out. It’s probably one of the reasons why Audra was acting like that to be honest.

The station has been stocking up on silver bullets, wooden stakes, cream, and other helpful little knick-knacks for the past couple weeks. Our reserves are pretty good, so we shouldn’t have too much trouble handling the supernaturals that head our way. It is All-Hallows Eve though, so something interesting is bound to come up. 

Do not fret, depending on how the shift goes, I’ll get a detailed report out sometime in the next couple of days.

It’ll be my first Halloween at WPD Supernatural’s Division and from what I can gather, It’s going to be on *hell* of a shift.
