When I was young, my family didn’t have anywhere to call home for more than a year at a time. We moved a lot. When I got older I learned this was due to my father’s job. 

It was around the age of ten that we finally were able to find a place to call home. I remember my parents were adamant that the house needed to be cleaned up and have some things fixed before we moved in.

A painstakingly long drive through the Colorado mountains accompanied moving day. It didn’t help that we drove during a light blizzard, but I didn’t care. I absolutely loved the snow and as we got higher in elevation, I was ecstatic to see the snowflakes grow in size.

“How much longer?” My younger sister, Madelyn, groaned from the seat next to me. 

“It should actually be right off of this road, just a few miles up.” My mom said, trying to keep the car steady while my dad followed in the moving truck.

“I hope the neighbors have kids too!” I said with so much curiosity. I had never had friends for longer than a school year. The idea of having one, knowing I wasn’t going to leave next summer, was what excited me the most.

We turned onto a tiny road that connected to the middle of nowhere highway. At the end sat a lone house surrounded by a snow covered field.

“Where are the other houses?” I asked with a hint of disappointment in my breath. 

“It’s just us! Your dad found us an amazing deal on this place. All of this is ours too!” My mom said as she gestured to the empty field surrounding us.

She looked back at me through the rear view mirror. I think she could see the disappointment in my eyes.

“Oh, honey. I know you were excited for a new city and friends close by, but we’re not too far out of town and from what I’ve heard, the school here is fantastic. I’m sure you’ll make lots of friends.”

As I grabbed my backpack from the truck, Madelyn charged past me to be the first one inside. I couldn’t let her beat me. I ran after her through the ankle high snow, but I was too late. She had already made it in and left the front door swinging in the wind.

As I stepped inside, I heard Madelyn yell from upstairs.

“This room is mine! This one’s mine!”

I found the stairs to the right of the front door and ran up to claim my room. That was a pretty easy task, as there were only two rooms upstairs apart from the bathroom that connected the two.

As Madelyn sang and danced from her room, I peaked into the second room. It was bigger than any room I ever had before. It had something else I had never had in a room before. A little door at the far end of the wall.

“I see you found the secret room.” My dad said as he hauled boxes past me.

I opened the door and tried to make out the second room through the darkness. It was maybe a fourth of the size of my room. The walls and floor were made from unfinished wood and it had a light bulb that dangled on a cord from the ceiling.

“No way! Evan, look outside!” Madelyn yelled from her room. 

I peered through the window. In the middle of a snow plastered field was a single, giant Oak tree with a treehouse built around it. It wasn’t your standard idea of a treehouse either, it was built in a circular shape around the tree, about 15 feet high. It even had an outdoor deck that extended further out. 

I ran downstairs to find my mother. “Mom! Can we go to the treehouse?” I could hardly contain my excitement.

“Well, that treehouse is one thing your dad and I haven’t had the chance to check out yet. We don’t know how old that wood is or how safe it is for you guys.”

I could feel that same wave of disappointment wash over again.

“How about this. If you give it a few days for the snow to pass, me and your dad will put that treehouse inspection at the very tip top of our list.” 

A week to the day passed, and my parents deemed the treehouse safe. I still remember that feeling in my chest as we made our way down the path to the treehouse. That feeling of excitement only a child truly knows.

Madelyn and I stood in awe underneath the giant Oak. A swinging ladder made of rope and wood hung near the center.

“Ladies first.” I said, gesturing Madelyn towards the ladder.

“No way, I’m going after you. I know if it can hold you, it can hold like three of me.”

“Are you calling me fat?” I questioned.

“Yes.”

I stumbled over my own frustration for a moment. 

“I’m not fat, mom says it’s just my metabolism. She said I get it from grandpa.”

I was fat.

Despite the harsh criticisms of my weight, I was happy to be first in the treehouse. I placed my foot on the first plank of wood and made my way up. About half way up the rope began to swing against my weigh. It was nerve wracking at first, but I soon found myself sitting in the entrance. 

“What’s it like up there?” Madelyn yelled from below.

“Uh, I don’t know. It looks like there was a bunch of stuff left up here.”

As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw a flash light sitting close by on the wooden floor. I picked it up and miraculously, it still had some juice in it. Through the flickering beam of light, I inspected the room. A cabinet sat to the left of me. To the right was a wall littered with band posters from the late 80’s, most of which I wouldn’t recognize until later in life. 

There was only one window in the treehouse. It sat within the door that lead to the wrap around deck. The light that shined into the room displayed one final piece. A wooden table and bench set. It was beautifully made. It was obviously hand made. Spiraling patterns were sanded into benches, both mirroring each other perfectly. 

Sitting on the table, was an absurd amount of art supplies.

“Woah, no way!” Madelyn exclaimed as she pushed past me. “I forgot my paint set when I was packing, but look at this!”

She was astonished. Ever since Madelyn was able to hold a brush, she was considered the artist of the family. Honestly, for a seven year old, she was pretty talented. Her eyes gazed over the table until-

“What is this?” She said, placing her finger on the end of the table.

It was a weird symbol. Three points jutted from the center and spun outward, clockwise. It was carefully carved into the wood and filled with a baby blue paint. We didn’t think much of it. 

I got thirsty and left Madelyn alone to get water and talk with my mother about the treehouse.

“Have you been out on the deck yet?” She asked.

I shook my head.

“Well when you go back you and Madelyn should really check it out. It’s got quite the view.”

I began to make my way back, following the trail my parents had made in the snow. I placed Madelyn’s water bottle in my jeans pocket and quickly climbed the ladder. 

“Hey, mom said we needed to look at the-“ I paused. Madelyn sat on the floor, sobbing. “What happened?” 

Her eyes were full of something heavier than fear. She didn’t respond.

“Madelyn…”

She looked at me, and said with a hint of dread in her voice “I want to go inside.”

“What happened?” She looked up at me from her red, tear soaked eyes.

“Someone talked to me.” She said in a soft whisper.

I tried to get more information out of her, but she wouldn’t speak. I ran out onto the deck, in hopes of catching whatever intruder had been in our treehouse. There was nothing to be found but the rustling leaves in the country side winds.

I helped her down by stabilizing the ladder from the ground below. The sun had began to set, painting the sky with bright orange and pink streaks. 

Our walk back to the house was quiet. Madelyn kept her focus on her boots as they swept through the snow.

“Are you okay?” She didn’t answer.

We made it to the back sliding glass door and as Madelyn reached for the handle I questioned her once more.

“What did you mean someone talked to you? I didn’t see anybody and there’s no way I missed anyone on the way up.”

Madelyn’s hands were still shaking, though I don’t think from the cold. She still would not budge.

Later that day, mom had the table set and dinner was ready. Everyone gathered around the table, everyone except for Madelyn.

“Mom do you want me to tell Madelyn dinner is ready?”

“I tried honey, she’s not feeling well. I’m starting to think we need to get you guys some heavier jackets, our Kansas immune systems aren’t built for the Colorado cold.”

After dinner, I did the dishes for my mom in exchange for an extra thirty minutes of computer time before bed.

As per usual, RuneScape would be the only thing on my agenda for the next hour.

As I booted up my old desktop, I couldn’t help but think about what had happened earlier. How did Madelyn hear somebody if there was no one there. I mean, there’s no way anyone else could have been up there.

Did she just imagine it? I know that’s the logical answer, but the fear that I saw in her eyes forced me to stray away from logic.

Anytime my mind started to venture too deep into the game, I was pulled back out of it. I couldn’t stop thinking about that damn tree house.

Whatever was happening, it made me upset. Now Madelyn would not want to play up there, and I surely did not want to go up alone.

It was at that moment my room was lit up with a beam of light emanating from outside. As fast as it appeared, it was gone. Almost like a cars headlights rushing by. There were no public roads for at least half a mile.

I jumped from my chair and peered through the window. I could barely make out the snow covered landscape at night. I flipped the light switch off so that I could see better. Still nothing. 

I could barely even make out the silhouette of the treehouse in the darkness. Nothing moved. Maybe I just imagined it. At least, I thought I had imagined it, until out of my peripheral I saw that same beam of light in the tree.

There was somebody in my treehouse.

I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night after what I saw. God knows I tried. Every time I forced my eyes closed, I was overcome with this unwelcoming anxiety that whatever it was would come back. I stared out the window until sunrise. 

I couldn’t stand the sight of that treehouse anymore. I wanted to tell my mom about the lights, but I remember being too worried that I’d be in trouble for staying up all night. Maybe I wasn’t the only one who saw it.

I forced my weight against the hinges of my door and it creaked open, filling the hall with silence. I looked left, then right. Nobody. I ventured throughout the house and still found nothing but an empty home.

A sense of dread began to set in. Just as soon as this house felt like a home, it was corrupted by the loss of all familiarity. 

I could feel tension in my chest as I frantically called for my mom. Tears began to well up in my eyes. Just before I could burst into hysterics, the garage door opened, followed by my Dad, Madelyn and my Mom.

My mom could tell I was scared.

“Honey, what’s wrong?” She said as she pushed past Madelyn.

“I couldn’t find anybody.” I said with shaky breath.

My dad interjected quickly. “Oh buddy, we were just helping Maddie. She had a little sleep walking fit.”

Sleep walking? Madelyn has never had any sleep issues as far as I knew of. 

Madelyn made her way towards the stars, pausing for a moment at the first step. She was visibly exhausted. Sluggishly, she made her way up.

My parents stepped into the living room and began to speak in hushed voices. Once again, it caught me out of the corner of my vision through the kitchen window. I didn’t know what was going on, but I knew it had something to do with that treehouse. 

Later that day, I decided to investigate the treehouse alone. When I climbed up, I reached for the flashlight, but it was no where to be found. I must have brought it inside with me at some point the day before. I sighed and pulled open the door leading to the deck to let some light in.

I paced around, analyzing the room. I needed answers. That’s when I noticed it, and it shook my entire being. As an adult now, I can recognize the band posters that were hanging up the first time we ventured into the treehouse. There were three posters. Queen, Aerosmith and Metallica. So it horrified me to see that the Aerosmith poster had been replaced by a Green Day poster. Even as a child, I could feel that almost primal sense of danger over something so mundane.

That night I was exhausted. I had hardly slept the night before due to the lights. I didn’t even bother asking for extra computer time. I just wanted to sleep. 

As I laid in my bed, I couldn’t get the days events to leave my mind. I tossed and turned, practically pleading with my mind to let me sleep. A storm began to roll in and surely was no help. A few hours passed and I finally stood up, frustrated, and swung my curtains closed. I couldn’t stand the sight of that treehouse. 

Right as I reached to get back in bed, something tapped on my door. It wasn’t a knock. It was quiet and effortlessly soft. I stood paralyzed. Again, three more taps. There was absolutely no way I was opening that door. 

Just as that thought entered my mind, I could hear Madelyn mumbling from the other side. 

I swung open the door and there she was. She looked straight through me. I had never seen somebody sleep walk before, but I immediately knew what was happening.

“Madelyn, it’s three in the morning.” I said as I rubbed my eyes, hoping that any kind of interaction would wake her up. Her demeanor did not change. I tried moving into her line of sight, but every time I did, she’d just continue to look over my shoulder. She then began to step into the room.

“No Maddie, this is my room.” I said as some sort of plea to snap her out of her trance. She then stopped, made direct eye contact with me and said “I’m ready to go play in the treehouse Evan.” And with that, she turned around and walked back to her room, leaving behind a trail of muddy footprints. 

I was so tired I could not even question what had just happened. I just wanted to sleep. I laid back in bed, the continuous thunder keeping my mind awake. Every flash of lightning illuminated the shadow of the tree house on my curtains. It’s like it was taunting me.

Just as my mind began to drift off, I heard the familiar sound of my door handle turning. I could see absolutely nothing through the darkness of the room. The hinges creaked as the door was slowly pushed open.

“Madelyn, go away I’m serious!” I yelled out of frustration. She didn’t respond. A flash of lightning struck outside and lit up my room for a split second. A naked man sat crouched on all fours in my doorway. I tried to scream for help, but it was useless. I was utterly petrified.

The floor boards creaked. Another flash illuminated the room once again and he was in the middle of the floor, still walking on his hands and feet. There was something wrong with him. His elbows and knees faced the wrong direction. 

The floor creaked a few more times, before I heard the cubby on the other end of the room open and then close. The final flash of lightning confirmed my worst fear. The man was no longer in my room.

My heart beat so fast through the rest of the night. I hyper focused on the cubby door and my fear spiked every time my room was lit up from the storm. 

I waited hours even after the sun rose to get up. When I stood, my legs became extremely cold as the air conditioning came in contact with my urine filled pants. 

I sprinted to the door and fled my room, screaming for my father as I left. I tried to explain to him what had happened, but I could tell he took it as seriously as a monster under the bed. Still, he humored me and stepped into the cubby. There was nothing.
I watched it all night and I know for a fact, that door never opened again.
