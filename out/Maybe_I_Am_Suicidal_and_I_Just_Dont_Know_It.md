TW: mention of suicide/sensitive or triggering scenarios

How can I even begin to express everything?
Maybe I’ll start by introducing myself.

My name is Yna. I live alone in a cramped apartment.
Actually — not entirely alone. I have a cat. Her name is Void. Of course she’s black.

I used to live with my family — two younger siblings and my mother.
Our father? Gone. I don’t even remember the last time we spoke his name.

But I do remember the mornings — waking up to my mother’s voice,
not soft, not gentle — but sharp enough to leave cuts you couldn’t see.

“Piece of shit.”
“Can’t even provide.”
“What kind of eldest sister are you?”
“Useless.”
“Fuck you.”
“You’re just my daughter.”
“No one asked for your fucking opinion.”

I learned early that silence was safer than explaining.
So one day, I left — quietly, trembling but determined.
I told myself: If I lose, I die.

Now I work in retail.
Sit on an office chair.
Do tasks for nine hours straight.
During breaks, I wave at people, ask how they are, smile when needed.
Then go back to my desk.
Clock out.

That’s my life — predictable, repetitive.
And for a while, it was enough.
I’d go home to Void, cook dinner for both of us, sit on my bed, and eat while she purred beside me.

But lately... it’s different.

I spend breaks alone.
No more conversations. Just scrolling, staring, sometimes sleeping.

I don’t feel sad. Not really.
Just empty.

Did I forget something today?
Did I finish all my tasks?
What will I cook later?

The basics.
The “I’m still functioning” checklist.

Except, I’m not. Not really.

“Maybe you should walk outside.”
A whisper.
“Huh?” I froze mid-chop, knife halfway through an onion.
But I live alone.

Hallucination? Fatigue? Hunger?
I don’t know.
It’s been happening — faint voices lately, like echoes trying to form words.

Who cares, right?
I’m still doing what I’m supposed to do.
Wake up. Work. Make money. Feed myself. Feed Void. Sleep. Repeat.

That’s survival.

“You okay?” my coworker Kat asked.
“Yeah? Why?” I smiled without looking up from my keyboard.
“You’ve been quiet. And that rooftop photo you posted— you were sitting on the edge.”

“Oh.”
I tried to recall it — me, dangling my legs fifty feet above the ground, grinning like I wasn’t afraid of anything.

“Are you not scared?” she asked. “It was windy.”
Scared? I don’t even remember what that feels like.

Fear, to me, is opening a message from my mother:
“How are you? Have you thought about coming home? Your siblings are starving. I can’t pay rent. They’re harassing us. Don’t you feel guilty, you stupid fuck?”

That’s fear. That’s guilt wrapped in love you can’t give back.

“I’m okay, Ms. Kat. Thank you for asking.”

That night, I lay on my bed, eyes closed.
“You seem heavy.”

A voice. Soft, like fog slipping through a crack in the window.

I opened my eyes. A figure sat by my door —
a woman-shaped shadow, her long hair dripping, pooling dark water on the floor.
Her eyes were hollow, like they’d cried themselves empty.

“Heavy?” I whispered.

“You carry too much,” she said.

I smiled faintly. “Is this what people see before they lose it?”

She tilted her head. “You’re already losing it.”

Days passed. Then came another one — a tall, faceless figure standing near my kitchen counter. His outline shimmered like smoke, and every time I blinked, he shifted, like my mind couldn’t decide what he looked like.

He never spoke. But whenever he appeared, the air thickened — like guilt had weight.

Then came the child — small, pale, barefoot. She sat under my table, humming a tune I half-recognized from my childhood.
When I asked who she was, she smiled with my sister’s missing tooth.

“You’re not scared of us?” the weeping woman asked one evening.

“Why would I be?” I said. “You’re probably just my brain protecting me.”

The faceless one tilted his head, voice like wind through metal:

“We can take you.”

I laughed. “Not tonight. I made beef brisket for me and Void.”

Void meowed loudly, as if agreeing.
They stayed quiet after that.

Weeks later, Void had grown — heavier, louder, alive in ways I wasn’t.
One night, I looked in the mirror and didn’t recognize myself.
Dark circles. Blank stare. My reflection blinked a second too late.

Then, my phone buzzed.
A message from my younger sister:

“Hi. I need $10 for a project. Please. If I fail, I’ll lose my scholarship.”

I opened my wallet. Two ten-dollar bills.
Next payday in two weeks.

I sighed and sent it anyway.

That night, when I came home, the apartment felt… off.
Void hissed at the corner where the faceless figure usually stood.

“They’re using you,” the weeping woman whispered.

“Who?”

“Everyone. Your family. Your job. Even your memories. You’ve forgotten how to live, Yna. You’re walking — but soulless.”

The faceless man stepped closer, shadows crawling across the floor toward my feet. The little girl reached out, touching my hand — ice-cold.

“You can rest now,” she said softly. “We’ll help you remember what it’s like to feel nothing.”

The lights flickered. My reflection in the mirror smiled — but I hadn’t.

“Wait…” I whispered, my throat tightening. “You said you could take me.”

“Yes,” they said together. “And now you’ve stopped fighting.”

Their darkness reached me — not burning, not cruel — just... accepting.
They didn’t tear me apart. They simply slipped into me.

And I felt something peel away.
Something light. Something human.

Void jumped onto my chest, purring, grounding me to the world.
The ghosts stepped back, fading into the walls.

The weeping woman whispered one last time,

“Your body stays.”

Morning came. Sunlight bled through the curtains.
Void brushed against my hand, purring softly.

I stood up, blank eyes staring at the light — feeling its warmth but not its meaning.

And I whispered,

“I’m still alive... I just did not know how to feel and live with it. I lost my soul.”
