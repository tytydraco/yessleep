I dont know why I\`m writing this, or why I think it will help. I guess I am just desperate- no, scratch that, I am desperate. Something is horribly wrong, and I don’t know what I\`m supposed to do.  I don’t know anything.

  
I am stupid. 

  
I am stupid, but I didn’t use to be. 

  
This may not be very coherent. I find it increasingly difficult to understand the passage of time and order of events. Things… just happen now. Its wouldn’t be so bad, in fact it would be kind of Zen, if I didn’t know I used to perceive the world in a different, more coherent fashion.

  
It all began some weeks ago, or maybe months. I find telling the passage of time harder than I used to. I was applying for a job and for some reason they required us to take an IQ test as part of the application process. I wasn’t overly concerned- I\`ve always been a good test taker and the last IQ test I took put me at approximately 150, which is well above the average. As I expected, I was called for an interview. They were, I was told, very impressed with my application and wanted to hire me. They were vague on the specifics of the job, something about conservation and protecting endangered species. The salary they offered was absurdly generous. I accepted the position on the spot. 

  
The job as strange. Hell, I\`d call it bizarre. I was given a small office with a chair and a desk and told to await an assignment. They told me to not bother my supervisor about assignments and just trust that they would be assigned when it was appropriate. I shrugged, reasoning that doing nothing while earning a massive salary didn’t seem like such a bad deal. 

I really should have questioned the whole arrangement.

The desk in my office was empty, save for a large bowl of bananas. At first, I played on my phone, but the battery is quite old and there wasn’t any electrical outlet in my office so the phone was soon out of power. With nothing else to do I sat on my chair and ate bananas. The whole thing was very strange, but I reasoned they would hand me an assignment soon. 

  
I waited for days, weeks even. Every day I showed up for work and sat in that empty little box, eating bananas. There wasn’t a breakroom or a kitchen, so I had no one to have lunch with. At first, I went out for lunch, but the building was quite far away from the closest restaurant. Soon I started staying in my office, and just had some extra bananas for lunch. 

  
I must have eaten… many bananas every day. I don’t know, more than a few. I find counting difficult these days. I\`ve never really liked bananas, but they kind of grow on you after a while.

I was bored at first. After a while, it started to feel meditative though. I just sat there, eating bananas. I usually threw the peels on the floor; someone always picked it up. 

  
At first, I thought about quitting, but I figured if I waited, I would get something to do eventually. At this point, I can’t really do any other job. 

  
 I can still write if I give myself a lot of time and use the spellchecker but talking is too hard. Other people just talk too fast for me to understand, and I can’t formulate sentences without thinking for minutes on end. I get angry easily- I couldn’t figure out how to use the microwave and I just lost it. I threw the microwave against the wall and proceeded to smash through my apartment, knocking chairs over and tearing every fabric apart with my hands and teeth. I still haven’t cleaned it. My apartment is a complete mess. I… forget to use the toilet sometimes, so there is human feces strewn about the place. On the plus side there are cockroaches and sometimes I manage to catch and eat one. That’s actually kind of nice. 

  
I can’t cook anymore, nor can I really buy food. I tried going to the supermarket, but they threw me out when I was found crouching on the fruit shelf, gorging myself on bananas. They just looked so good, and I was so hungry. I bit the cashier and ran off. I just got so angry- she stared at me and showed her teeth like she was challenging me, while making these soft sounds. I think she was saying something, but I couldn’t make it out. She was clearly aggressive though. 

  
Maybe I should eat something else than bananas though. I think I might have a vitamin deficiency. My whole body aches almost constantly. My face is the worst- I have these weird growth on my brow and my jaw feels funny. Some of my teeth dropped out, though I have some other teeth under them, so I guess its fine. I can’t see very well; everything is fuzzy and I cant really tell colors apart anymore. I\`m getting really hairy too, and I find it harder and harder to stand up straight- my back has gotten stuck in this really weird hunched position. I\`ve started habitually supporting myself with my hands when walking around my apartment so I don’t fall down. As a bonus, my knuckles have gotten really strong and it doesn’t feel uncomfortable to lean on them anymore. I should go to a doctor I guess, but I can’t figure out how to book an appointment. Reading is getting harder and harder, though I can still manage if I give myself time. 



I haven’t paid the bill in a while. Maybe in months. My landlord is angry at me, but I can’t understand what he is saying. Probably the money, right? I think I might lose my lease. I don’t know. My landlord went away when I threw some feces at him, so I think I\`m safe. He wont dare to come back.

  
Just in case, I think I can stay in my office though. There\`s lots of bananas there and my manager doesn’t mind if I sleep there. It sounds nice, just eating bananas and sitting around. Maybe it won’t be so bad. I know they clean up my poo too, and my manager had this exercise equipment installed. Its like a swing where I can hang and swing around and stuff. Its really neat. I can even eat bananas while I am swinging. 

  
My manager told me they are very pleased with my work so far. He said I\`m almost ready for field work. They\`re sending me to this nature preserve in Uganda. They are trying to protect the chimpanzee population there. 

  
He says I\`ll be a good fit. 

I think things are going to be OOK
