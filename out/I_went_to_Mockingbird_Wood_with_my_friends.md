My friends and I have always loved going out to the woods. It started with my friend Mark and I, going out and making small bonfires and coming home late smelling like wood smoke. We started doing this in our freshman year of highschool and just kept doing it as we got older. In that time, our other friends would start accompanying us. Before long, our weekends were spent camping out in the wooded area Mark and I had found when we were just barely teens.

I had found the place originally. It was a clearing about a mile and a half into the wooded area that we all nicknamed Mockingbird Wood. It had no official name, but the first time I went out there, I noticed a mockingbird, so I figured it was a fitting name for the place. The little clearing sat circled by trees with the trail heading in going over a river where a mass of large stones created a natural bridge, and another trail heading out along a cliff side that followed the river. We would go out there and set up makeshift shelters, have bonfires and even fished once or twice. The woods were a special place for me, like some sort of fantasy where my friends and I could have our own little world. All the man-made structures of civilization would disappear and it would just be us standing in the same surroundings as our ancient ancestors. There was something magical about that, something that felt primordial and ancient. Maybe that's why we kept going back, or maybe it had to do with our connections to each other and how that sacred place tied into them. Whatever the reason, Mockingbird Wood was special to us.

When we were in our early twenties, we decided we would go out for an overnight camp-out. We didn't get out as nearly as often as we used to since life demands jobs and responsibilities, but by some miracle, six of us found the time to hike out there and have some fun. Mark and I had sold the rest of the group on the idea, which hadn't taken much pushing. My guess is they were longing for the comfortable isolation and peace that the woods would offer.

Jessie was the first one I called after talking to Mark. I had a crush on her and thought this might be a shot to make something happen with her, so I was pretty delighted when she said she was going to be there. That delight was lessened a little bit when she said she was bringing her friend Maddie along. It's not that I didn't like Maddie, but she would always draw Jessie away each time I get up the courage to try to tell her how I felt.

I would later find out that Mark had called our friend Martin and his girlfriend Rachel to come with. I was pretty happy to hear Martin would be there. He was the third “M” after all. We called him that because Mark and I also had names that started with the letter M. Mason, Mark and Martin. The three Ms.

We rode up there Friday night, the mid spring air neither cold nor hot and the sky devoid of any clouds to obstruct the full force of the moon and stars. I couldn't have asked for a nicer evening to return to Mockingbird Wood.

I was riding along with Mark, rolling a joint for us to smoke on our way up there, when we saw Martin and Rachel on the road behind us. As Martin pulled alongside us, I sat up in my seat and dropped my pants to push my ass out the window. When I heard his horn blasting repeatedly, I knew he'd seen it and sat back down.

“You know he's got his girl with him, right?” Mark said chidingly.

“Hey, if she's gonna stick around, she had better know how we get down. If she's cool, she'll think it was funny,” I replied, lighting the joint and passing it Mark.

“You're not wrong, but maybe we should ease her into it instead of letting her see all the crazy immature shit we do at once?” came his muffled follow up as he pulled on the joint.

“Nah, it's like swimming,” I mused. “You jump in the deep end and hope you don't drown!”

We were still laughing about it as we pulled up to the empty field by the road where we all parked our cars before heading into the woods. Rachel and Maddie were already parked there, talking while Maddie smoked a cigarette and leaned against the back of her old jeep. Jessie smiled and waved to us as we parked, her long brown hair bouncing side to side with each motion of her hand. Maddie looked like the opposite of her, with short blonde hair and no reaction to our arrival.

We parked and Mark popped the trunk to grab the case of cheap beer he had brought, while I grabbed the high powered flashlight laying on the floorboard in front of me.

“Cool, we got a full moon tonight,” said Martin, looking up at the sky.

“I thought you saw a full moon earlier, numb nuts,” I joked around, prompting a laugh from him and Mark.

“More like a half moon! You looked like you had two pale pancankes where your ass should be, dude,” came Rachel's voice from the other side of Martin's car as she stepped out.

Martin had done well for himself with Rachel. She was a picturesque brunette with bright blue eyes and a warm smile.

I held my hands out to either side and turned towards Mark.

“Told you, man!” I shouted.

“So where is this place?” Maddie asked, sounding completely unamused.

“Just through the woods up here,” answered Mark, hefting the case of Natural Lite beer and closing the trunk.

“Follow me, I'll show you guys the way,” I said, turning on the flashlight.

It took about twenty minutes to make our way through the woods to our destination. We talked while we made the journey, my attention mostly on Jessie.

“So why do you call it Mockingbird Wood?” she asked me.

“Well, when I first came up here, there was mockingbird in the trees. I was whistling at it and getting it mimic me. They're cool birds, they'll even sing at night and stuff. Anyways, it was my first time being in these woods, so I named it mockingbird because of it.”

She smiled at me, her eyes moving down a little and then looking back up at my face. I smiled back and opened my mouth to say something only for Maddie to cut me off.

“Were you like a birdwatcher or something?” she asked in a harsh tone.

“No, I just spent a lot of time outside.”

“Huh. Weird.”

I silently wished Maddie hadn't come with us and kept pushing further into the woods. After a few minutes, we came to the little river that flowed past the large walks that we used to make our way across. I crossed first to the other bank and shined my flashlight down onto the rocks so the others could make their way across. After that, we walked uphill until we leveled out and came into the clearing where I had played with the mockingbird all those years ago.

Martin and Mark built a little fire where we always did, in a divot of bare earth that we dug out when we built the first one. I silently wondered how many fires we had burned there at this point and sat on one the logs we had nearby to start rolling another joint. While I did this, Rachel pulled out a little portable speaker and started playing some music, the air filling with Out Of Touch by Hall and Oates. Jessie and Maddie sat a little ways away, the crack of their beer cans opening echoing in the trees.

“I like you music!” said Jessie in a bubbly voice to Rachel.

“Thanks, I get my tastes from my dad.”

“Can we play some rave music after this?” Maddie cut in.

“Maybe,” replied Rachel with an uncomfortable expression.

I was more than a little relieved to realize it wasn't just me who didn't care for Maddie.

“Hey, you remember when we camped up here during the snowstorm?” Martin asked me.

“Hell yea, we made that weird hut thing and packed snow around it so it looked like igloo!” I said with a grin.

“Yea, and then we hot-boxed it until we couldn't breath,” Mark added, prompting us to laugh hard at the memory.

“Hey, you hear that?” came Jessie's voice.

“Hear what?” I queried, straining my ears.

“There's a mockingbird singing!” she said excitedly.

Sure enough, I could hear the tell-tale song of a lone mockingbird looking for a mate somewhere high above us.

“It's looking for a mate. They'll go on all night sometimes,” I said, smiling at her and basking in the smile she reflected back at me.

“Sounds exhausting,” chimed Maddie, on cue.

I got up, pushing down the annoyance I felt.  
“I got to pee real quick. I'll be right back,” I said, excusing myself.

I got up and walked up the trail that ran parallel to the river. Once I was sure I was far enough away, I started doing my business.

“Hey, you hear that?” I heard Jessie's faint voice drift out a little ways away.

“Jessie?” I whispered into the darkness around me.

“Over here,” she replied a little further up the trail.

I started walking that way, wondering how she had got past me without me noticing. I rounded a short bend and peered into the dark woods all around me.

“I'm over here,” she whispered just behind some bushes.

I started pushing my way through the bushes, wishing I had the flashlight to see where I was going.

“What are you doing-”

That was as far as I got before my question turned into a yelp of alarm and I fell twenty feet straight down to the rocky river bank below. I didn't shout or yell as I fell, just made a sudden gasping sound and down I went. I landed on my feet, feeling something pop and pain blossoming up through my ankle and knee in my left leg. That's when I registered what had happened and started yelling.

“Help!” I heard my voice trill and reverberate off the trees.

After a couple seconds, I heard the crash of footfalls through the overgrown vegetation accompanied by Mark's voice.

“Mason!” he shouted.

“Down here!”

I was suddenly bathed in the bright beam of the flashlight and was able to see how my leg looked. It was bent awkwardly and already swelling badly.

“Stay there! I'm going to get help!” he yelled down to me.

“Damn it, I don't have a signal out here...” I heard Martin say.

“You'll have to go back to the cars, it's the closest place you're going to be able to make a call,” I called up to them.

“Don't worry, Mason, I'm on it!” Mark reassured me. “Everyone stay here with Mason, I'll be back as fast as I can with some help.”

At this moment, I wasn't scared or anything, just in a lot of pain. I wanted to cry from how bad it hurt, but I was too aware of Jessie somewhere nearby and didn't want her to see me like that.

“Someone, toss me a beer!” I called up to my friends on the ridge.

A short second later, a beer landed in the mud next to me. I rinsed it off in the river and cracked it open, eliciting a blast of foam as I did so, and took a deep gulp of the carbonated beverage.

“Thank God, I thought I was going to be sober there for a moment,” I shouted back up the ridge, prompting laughter from everyone up there. “Crisis averted!”

I groaned in pain and rolled onto my back, using my good leg to push me up out of the water until my back was against the dirt wall behind me.

“I'd toss you a joint too, but it'd get wet,” came Rachel's voice.

“It's okay, I'm still pretty high,” I said in all seriousness. “I even thought I heard Jessie out here earlier. I think I've been smoking too much as it is.”

“You must have been stoned. I was with Maddie the whole time,” Jessie laughed far above me.

I sipped on my beer and tried to ignore the throbbing agony of my leg, wondering if I had broken it. I could feel the meat of it swelling so bad that it was making my pant leg tighter.

In that moment's silence, the whole wood started to come alive with the chirps of mockingbirds. I thought I heard someone say something up above, but couldn't make it out over the sudden cacophony of birdsong.

“What?” I shouted up to them.

“I said, there's a lot of mockingbirds all of sudden!” came Martin's voice.

I stopped and listened as the mating calls lasted for a few minutes and died away.

“That was weird,” I called up to them.

There was no answer.

“Guys, you there?”

“Yea, we're here, just hang in there. Mark should be back soon.”

We waited in silence for a while. After what felt like a pain filled eternity had passed, I shouted again to make sure they were still there, more to distract myself from the pain than to actually verify their presence.

“Hey, you guys didn't leave did you?”

“It's a mockingbird!” I heard Jessie say.

“It's a bunch of them. Is Mark back yet?”

Nothing.

“Hey, can you hear me?”

“You must have been stoned,” Jessie laughed.

“Yea, I must have been, but it's wearing off. Can one of you go check to see what's taking Mark so long?”

“Yea, I'll be back soon,” Martin answered me, his voice sounding monotone.

I figured he must be worried, so I followed up with some reassurance.

“Don't worry, Martin, my flat ass cushioned my fall!”

No laughter. They must be getting worried. I pulled my jacket tighter around me as the mud leached the heat from my body. It was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it was making me colder, but on the other, it was chilling my injured leg and surely helping with the swelling.

“Don't worry, Mason. Mark will be back soon,” came Maddie's worried voice.

I was a little surprised to hear her actually being comforting to me, having been convinced that woman lacked any kind of empathy.

“I'm not that worried, you shouldn't be either,” I assured her.

“Why do you call it Mockingbird Wood?” I heard Jessie ask.

I figured she was trying to keep me talking to make sure I wasn't going into shock or anything. I felt a little embarrassed that I was reduced to this state in front of her, but answered her anyways.

“Like I told you earlier, I was playing with a mockingbird when I first came here years ago.”

There was a thump in the mud next to me and I turned to see another beer sticking up halfway out of the mud.

“Thanks!” I hollered up to them and took the beer, downing the rest of my open one.

The alcohol was helping to ease the pain a little bit, so I decided another one would be a welcome addition.

“Seriously, where's Mark and Martin?” I asked, starting to get nervous.

“It's a mockingbird!” said Jessie again.

“Why do you keep saying that?” I asked politely, hiding the fact that I was getting frustrated.

Before she could answer me, I heard Rachel's voice.

“I get my taste from my dad.”

I got quiet. Something felt... off. I shook my head, wondering if maybe I was just concussed.

“Guys, maybe I'm just messed up, but you're acting weird.”

“I'd toss you a joint too, but it'd get wet,” Rachel said in response.

“What?” I asked in pure confusion.

“Sorry, just trying to think of ways to help!” Rachel continued.

“I'm not sure how that helps...” I said, feeling a little drunk.

“It's a mockingbird!” Jessie said again.

I was starting to get creeped out. I pulled out my phone, planning to use the light on it to look around, but it was either damaged or dead.

“What's taking Mark and Martin so fucking long? One of them should of come back by now!”

“Don't worry, Mason!” I heard Mark saying.

“Oh, thank God, I was getting worried for a moment there,” I laughed.

“Everyone stay here, I'll be back with some help!” he said.

“What the fuck, Mark? I thought you already went to get some help?” I asked.

“It's a mockingbird!” Jessie intoned.

“What the hell is going on?” I shouted.

“It's okay,” came Maddie's voice, making my blood run ice cold.

Her voice didn't come from above me.

It came from the dark on the opposite river bank.

“Maddie, how did you get down here?”

“It's a mockingbird!” Jessie's voice answered from the same place.

I yelped in pain as I tried to scramble to my feet and failed. There was no physical way Jessie could have gotten down here that fast.

“Stay the fuck away from me!”

“Don't worry, Mason!” I heard Mark say.

“You're not Mark!” I shouted at the dark patch of wood across from me.

“Remember that time we camped here during a snowstorm?” not Martin asked me.

“Yea, and hot-boxed it!” non Mark added.

“Help! Get away from me!” I shouted, throwing my half full beer can as hard as I could in the direction of the voices.

There was a thump in the mud next to me and another beer can landed.

“Stop fucking with me, damn it!” I screamed.

“It's a mockingbird!” not Jessie yelled from across the river.

I tried to stand again, my feet trying to function and only succeeding in pushing myself half way up the dirt wall at my back and sliding back down. The trees above me broke out in the cacophony of mockingbird mating calls again, drowning out every other noise around me.

I saw some movement in the shadows across the river and hurled the still unopened can of beer in that direction, hearing it make a heavy clang as it made contact with something. The roar of anger cut through the sound of the birds which fell silent after.

“It's a mockingbird!” I heard it say in Jessie's voice again.

“Yea, I get it, it's a fucking mockingbird! Help me! Anyone!” I shouted out into the empty woods.

The minutes seemed to stretch out forever. I wasn't even sure how long I had been down there anymore. I tried to stand up for the third time and managed to get my good leg underneath me. However, I didn't really know where I could go. The river was shallow enough that I could wade across it, but God knows I didn't want to be on the other bank with whatever was over there. I certainly couldn't make it up the sheer cliff behind me. That left only one other option: following the river.

I waded out into the cold water, hearing something stir in the woods on the other side as I moved.

“I'll be back as fast as I can with help!” came Mark's voice, moving along with me from the shadows across the river.

“It's a mockingbird!” came Jessie's voice above me again.

“I'm coming back with a gun! How's that for help, you assholes!” I yelled stupidly into the dark, hearing my voice vanishing among the uncaring trees.

I trudged my way painfully through the water, unable to bend the knee of my left leg. Each painful movement forward made me gasp through my gritted teeth as I moved. In some spots, the river came up to my neck, making me wonder if I was going to have to try to swim with my lame leg dragging me down. Thankfully, it never got any deeper than that.

At one point, the mud of the river bottom sucked one of my shoes in so deep that I couldn't free it. It was holding my busted leg in place, which didn't have the strength in it to yank the shoe free, so I slipped it off and kept going.

“Help!” I heard a new voice say.

I froze, realizing I was hearing my own voice repeating back to me. Whatever was stalking me, it was keeping right along the river bank, not leaving my side for a second.

“It's a mockingbird!” came Jessie's voice above me.

“You must have been stoned!” came Jessie's voice across the river.

I didn't respond and kept pushing forward, wondering what I would do when I got to the rocks we had used as a bridge to cross the river. At that point, I'd have to cross to head back on land, and I didn't think I'd stand much chance there with my leg being the way it was.

“It's a mockingbird, mockingbird, mockingbird!” came not Jessie's voice from the river bank.

I pushed forward again and felt my hand brush one the large stones in the river. In the moonlight, I could make out the trail on either side of me painted in silvery hues. I leaned back, trying to my head as close to the water as I could. I reached down, patting my hand along the riverbed until I felt the hard edges of a fist sized stone. As quietly as I could, I lifted it up out of the river and flung it as far away into the river ahead of me as I could.

It made a loud splash, and the entire wood erupted into birdsong again. I could make out something moving quickly towards where the stone had landed, leaving the bank seemingly clear.

“It's a mockingbird!” I heard further down the river.

Realizing I wasn't going to get a better shot, I lifted myself from the water as quietly as I could and started limping towards the entrance of the woods. I did my best to be quiet, but with my leg so badly injured, it was slow going. I gritted my teeth and did my best to not grunt in pain as I hobbled my way along.

I had been hobbling for a few minutes when I heard a voice a ways back behind me call out.

“Don't worry, Mason! I'll be as fast as I can!” came Mark's voice.

I started hobbling faster, still trying not to make too much noise.

“It's a mockingbird!” I heard the fake Jessie say, a little bit closer.

I started hopping on my good foot, lurching painfully as I willed my body forward despite the pain. The uneven ground threatened to topple me with every movement in the darkness, but I kept going. Finally, I saw a beam of light up ahead and felt a momentary glimmer of hope. That hope vanished when I reached it though.

It was the flashlight. The one Mark had taken with him. It was laying on the forest floor, shining into nothing. I picked it up as I felt something wet land on my neck. I looked up and saw Mark's body, horribly maimed and suspended in the trees above. His legs and arms were twisted and his face half tore off. I would have screamed if I wasn't too scared to do so.

“Stay there!” I heard Mark's voice call out from behind me. It was getting even closer.

I thought fast and hurled the flashlight as hard as I could into the woods off to my left. I then resumed my hopping gait, trying like hell to get out of the woods as fast as my ruined leg would allow.

Behind me, I heard something big tear into the undergrowth where I had thrown the flashlight. I had bought myself a little time, but only a little. I kept going, each movement sending fresh waves of pain radiating throughout my left side. I was almost ready to give up, to just lay down and try to allow whatever this thing was to kill me as fast as possible when I saw the trees give way to open air.

“It's a mockingbird!” I heard behind me as I forced my leg to keep moving.

“Can we play some rave music after this?” came Maddie's voice.

“I get my taste from my dad,” chimed not Rachel.

“I'll be fast!” came Mark's voice.

“We got a full moon,” said not Martin.

“Down here!” said my own voice.

I stumbled out into the field and, despite incredible pain, ran to Mark's car. Every step made me scream in agony, which the voices behind me mimicked perfectly. It sounded like an entire crowd was behind me now.

I climbed into the driver seat and closed the door, waiting for whatever it was out there to catch up. It never did. I sat there, shivering and watching the woods unblinkingly. After a long time of sitting there in silence, I heard a voice call out from the darkness of the woods.

“There's a mockingbird singing!” I heard Jessie's voice say, followed by Maddie's voice saying “sounds exhausting.”

Then nothing.

I shivered there all night, watching as the sun lazily rose up over the horizon. As the sunrise broke over the land, I saw a lone car winding up the road and jumped out to wave it down. The old man driving it let me use his phone to call the police and then gave me a ride back into town.

Later on, they'd say it was a bear that attacked and killed my friends. Their bodies were found mutilated up in the woods, or, what was left of them. They tried to tell me I must of imagined everything, but I know I didn't. Still, I didn't push the issue because I didn't want to end up institutionalized, and I couldn't make things right from inside an asylum.

I miss Mark. I miss Martin. I miss Jessie and Rachel. Hell, I even miss that bitch, Maddie. Not a day has gone by that I haven't thought about them and wondered what the hell really killed them. Maybe that's why I'm here now.

I'm parked outside the entrance to Mockingbird Wood. The sun is setting and I'm as ready as I'll ever be. I have a shotgun filled with slugs sitting on my lap and I'm sending this off in case I don't come back.

When I was in the river, I told those things I was coming back with a gun, and I don't intend to be a liar about it. I hope they remember how I screamed in pain running for the car. I hope they remember how to make that sound again. If they don't, I'm going to remind them.
