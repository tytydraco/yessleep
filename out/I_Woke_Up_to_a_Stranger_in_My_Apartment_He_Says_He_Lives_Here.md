I'm always so tired after going home. 

The fluorescent scream of the office lights still echoes behind my eyes, even here in the blessed dimness of the stairwell. I climb three flights, each step feeling like I’m dragging an anvil chained to my ankle.

My key finds the lock on Apartment 3B, my lock. The deadbolt thunks open. I shoulder the door in, smelling the faint, comforting ghost of last night’s cheap instant noodles and the dusty warmth trapped inside. 

I don’t even make it to the bedroom. 

The sagging, familiar embrace of my old couch in the living room calls out. 

I sink into it, the springs groaning their familiar complaint beneath my weight. The fabric smells faintly of dust and me as sleep drags me under.

A few hours later, I jolt awake in terror as a hand grabs my shoulder and shakes me violently. 

"Hey! HEY!" someone shouts.

I jerk awake, gasping, disoriented. Silver moonlight cuts the room into sharp shapes and deep, pooling shadows. A man leans over me, his face gaunt with sweat in the gloom. His eyes are wide, wild marbles reflecting the weak light. 

"Get up! What the hell are you doing in my apartment?"

 His voice is a harsh rasp, cutting straight through whatever dream I was trapped in.

Panic surges through me. I lurch upright, heart pounding. 

“Your *what*?” I blink hard, trying to steady my vision. “No. No, this is *my* apartment. This is 3B! I live here!”

The man takes a step back, just enough to half-merge with the shadows by the doorway. “Are you out of your damn mind? I *live* in 3B! What are you even doing here?”

“I don’t know who you are,” I say, trying to sound firm, authoritative, anything but panicked. “But you need to leave before I call the police.”

“Oh, I need to leave? That’s rich. You broke into my place and you're threatening me?”

I run a hand through my hair, eyes flicking to the hallway. Could I shove him out and lock the door? Could I grab my phone—where is my phone?—and call someone? I take a cautious step toward him, hands half-raised. 

“Look, I don’t know what this is, maybe you got the wrong floor or something, or maybe you’re confused, but this is my apartment, alright? You don’t live here.”

He stares at me. Then, with sharp, jerking movements, he points toward the kitchenette. “Oh yeah? Then tell me that’s your owl mug.”

I follow his finger. A chipped blue owl mug sits on the coffee table like a trap.

I blink. “That… I don’t know. That’s not mine.”

“Damn right it’s not!” he snaps. “That’s *my* mug. And where’s my sailboat painting? I had it right there!” He jabs a finger toward the wall above the TV. "Are you a thief?" 

I turn. My faded Swiss Alps poster is gone. In its place, a garish print of a sailboat on water so blue it looks fake.

 “Wait. I—I had a poster there. Mountains. Swiss Alps. I swear it was there.”

The man just stares at me, chest rising and falling fast. I hold up my hands like I’m warding off a wild animal.

“Okay. Maybe… maybe I screwed up.” My voice wavers, half-swallowed by the silence. “Maybe I’m wrong. I must’ve come in the wrong door. I didn’t mean to, shit, I’m so sorry.”

I take a step back, knees weak. 

“I’ll go, alright? I’ll just, get my stuff and go—”

But something stops me.

I glance back at the coffee table, at that blue owl mug. It’s not just unfamiliar. It’s *wrong*. The eyes aren’t painted right, they’re uneven. One stares forward. The other’s cocked sideways, like it’s watching the hallway behind me.

The man hasn’t moved. His expression has changed, less angry now. More uncertain. His eyes flick from the wall to the table to me.

“I don’t… remember this table being glass,” he says quietly.

I look down. The table’s wood. It’s always been wood.

“What are you talking about?” I ask, but my voice is too soft to sound confrontational.

“No, it was glass,” he mutters. “Round. Had a chip on the edge from when I dropped the takeout. This one’s wood. Square. And that lamp...”

He turns slowly. 

“That’s not my lamp.”

Something creaks in the bedroom.

Neither of us moves.

“I think,” he says, breath fogging lightly in the suddenly cold air, “I think this isn’t your apartment. Or mine.”. 

The frantic anger is gone, replaced by a mirror of my own icy fear.

"Keys," he rasps, digging into his pocket with trembling fingers. He pulls out a keyring. "We need to get out of here. We’ll figure out what the hell’s going on outside."

My own keys are cold, heavy lumps in my hand. We don’t speak again. The silence is a suffocating presence, thick with the smell of decay and the unnerving feeling of being watched by the very shadows that cling to the walls. 

The hallway to the door seems longer than it should be. I take a step, and the carpet squelches faintly beneath my foot, I glance down. The floor looks the same. Beige, ugly, a little stained. But now I don’t trust it.

Behind us, the bedroom door creaks again, only this time it doesn't stop. It opens slowly, with the hush of breath sliding between teeth.

He doesn’t turn. Neither do I.

“Don’t look back,” he whispers. His voice shakes. “Just walk.”

We move, inching forward. Every object in the living room seems shifted. The couch leans ever so slightly toward the wall, cushions caved in like something heavy just rose from them. The bookshelf is missing a shelf. 

My hand tightens around the keyring. The keys rattle too loudly, like they’re trying to call attention to us. Like they want something else to hear.

“We’re almost there,” I murmur, not sure who I’m trying to reassure, him, or myself. The front door is ten feet away. Eight.

A soft knock echoes from inside the bedroom. 

The man beside me flinches. I don’t dare look. The temperature drops. My breath fogs the air, hangs there, then drifts backward, against the laws of physics.

I choke on it. “This place… this *thing*… it’s copying us.”

“Badly.”

The front door looms closer now, but the handle seems… off., longer than I remember. 

He reaches the door first, his hand trembling violently as he tries to jam his key into the deadbolt. It scrapes uselessly against the plate. 

"It won't… it won't fit!" Panic edges back into his voice.

"It should just unlock from inside!" I hiss, my hand closing over the cold knob. I twist. 

It turns freely. *Thank god*. With a surge of desperate hope, I yank the door open.

We stumble out together into the hallway, gasping lungfuls of stagnant, unmoving air. 

It tastes thick with dust and that same underlying damp decay. The hallway light fixture is shattered, glass shards glittering dully on the floor below. Weak, grey pre-dawn light filters from a grimy window at the far end, revealing a scene that stops us dead.

The hallway is a ruin.

Wallpaper hangs in long, mouldering strips, revealing crumbling plaster underneath. The carpet is threadbare, stained with dark, unidentifiable patches, pulled up in places to show warped floorboards.

Doors to other apartments hang askew on broken hinges, revealing glimpses of darkness within. Cobwebs thick as gauze drape the corners and ceiling. The air is frigid, smelling overwhelmingly of damp rot, mildew, and neglect. Utter, absolute desolation.

"This…" the man beside me whispers, his voice cracking. "This building… it’s condemned. Look!" 

He points a shaking finger towards a large, official notice nailed crookedly to the wall opposite my door – our door. Apartment 3B. The notice is faded, water-stained, but the bold red letters are unmistakable: CONDEMNED. STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND. ENTRY PROHIBITED.

My blood turns to ice. 

We both slowly turn to look back at the door we just emerged from. Apartment 3B.

The wood is warped, the paint blistered and peeling. A thick layer of grime coats the surface, thick as old moss. The number—*3B*—is barely visible beneath it, the brass digits green with corrosion.

The keyhole looks rusted shut. It looks like it hasn’t been opened in years.

The man raises his hand, slowly, like lifting the key costs him something. I look down at mine. Both identical. Both for 3B. Both seemingly useless against the decayed reality before us… yet they worked moments ago. .

He meets my eyes. Our keys hang limp in our hands. The only sound is the frantic hammering of our hearts and the silence. 

And then the shadows behind the door shift.

At first, I almost miss it. just a flicker of movement in the dark. A smudge of black deeper than the shadows. But then it pushes forward, slow and deliberate.

It isn’t a person. Not quite.

The shape doesn’t hold together right. Limbs bend where they shouldn’t, joints jutting at broken angles. Where a face should be, there’s only a hollowed-out suggestion of one, like a mask left too close to a flame. And the worst part? The hallway isn’t big enough for it. The ceiling should scrape its skull. The walls should press against its shoulders. But it keeps coming anyway, folding itself into the space like it’s bending the apartment around it.

The shape tilts its head.

My ribs clamp tight, breath trapped like a live thing in my throat. The man beside me makes a sound, not quite a whimper, maybe a prayer.

A wet *crack* splits the silence. The doorframe splinters, just a hairline fracture, but it sounds like a gunshot in the still air.

We run. Stairs blur underfoot. 

We don’t stop until concrete turns to asphalt, until the sky bleeds dawn.

Our eyes meet, a silent scream passing between us. My stomach drops as reality rearranges itself in my mind.

*This isn't right.*

The street signs are unfamiliar. The buildings wear strange colors. And that terrible, clawing realization:

I don't live in an apartment.

I own a house. A blue colonial with hydrangeas out front. A mailbox with mine and Olivia's names painted on the side. A garage where my daughter's bike leans against the wall.

Cold sweat trickles down my back.

*How did we get inside that place?*

*Who let us in?*

But the most chilling question lingers between us, unspoken:

What in God's name did we just escape from?
