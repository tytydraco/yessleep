When you’ve been around for five plus decades and you’re still single, the loneliness hits you like a barrel of frozen shit to the noggin. Even a tug to my nudie magazines left me a sweaty exhausted mess. Out of breath, chugging tap water like there was no tomorrow. I was reading the Sunday paper during one scorching afternoon when my phone buzzed. Marla, one of those fifty-plus I connected with on an internet site, sent me an email inviting me over. I almost fell out of my lawn chair; it had been five years since my last date. That damn missing tooth front and center made it difficult to advertise what I had to offer. Beer gut and a bald head certainly didn’t help. But on that day Marla messaged me, it felt like a new chapter was about to begin.

I threw on my best shirt and pants and slid a trucking cap over my head. I stopped at the one gas station in town to freshen up that stinky breath of mine. Grabbed a pack of gum when I noticed an erection pill packet dangling from a hook.

*StiffPrick*

*From soft to hard in seconds!*

I threw it on the counter and the scrawny clerk locked eyes with me.

“Hot date?” he said and scanned it.

“I suppose you could say that. Not a lot of single women out in these parts. Most of the good ones seem to be popping babies out before their wrinkles settle in.”

When I finally made it to Marla’s place, she was sitting on her porch rocking back and forth. I stepped out and waved. She stood up and greeted me.

“Hey Ron, how are you, my friend.”

We exchanged pleasantries for half an hour, and then she took me into the bedroom and pulled off my jean belt. She went to work with her hands, but I’m not ashamed to admit that I was flaccid, having a little difficulty giving her my full attention down below.

“I got this pill, should help with that. I do apologize. Give me just a second.”

“No rush honey. Grab a condom in the drawer while you’re at it.”

After a little fun beneath the sheets, I strapped on my jimmy hat, and she climbed on top of me. Roughly ten seconds into thrusting, my penis went fully hard. Too hard. Too erect. Now, I’ve felt pain before. I mean, I once fell onto a cactus. But the pain I felt when I was inside Marla was far beyond my comprehension. Imagine shaving the hairs on your ball sack with a butter knife and then plunging that knife into your scrotum. I howled like a wild hyena, as my penis grew to such an inhuman size. I knew something was wrong when Marla’s body jerked like she had been stabbed. Just behind her, I noticed something moving in the dimly lit room. My penis had exited her back and was hovering around like a snake being charmed by its owner.

I flipped on the light next to the bed and gasped at the sight before me. My penis had impaled Marla. She slowly slid down my shaft and collapsed on top of me lifeless. My heart rate soared. On the verge of passing out, I rolled Marla off me and caught a better look at the monster that my junk had transformed into. My penis must have been at least three feet long. The tip of my shaft looked like a bird’s nest filled with hundreds of sharp tentacles. I walked cautiously to the landline to call medical personnel, as my penis violently thrashed against the walls and floor. 

When those health care workers arrived, they found me sprawled out on the floor with my enormous penis rummaging through a garbage can. The men shined their lights in my eyes. I was just barely hanging on. The pain was unbearable. 

“Cut it off,” I screamed. “Please, I can’t take it anymore. Cut it off!”

I dozed off. When I awoke, I was being operated on in the hospital. The doctors and nurses were just as shocked as me. Never seen anything like it. When the surgery was over, my penis was gone. Got a damn catheter with me the rest of my days.

I’m fortunate no charges were brought upon me with Marla’s death. Small town folks out here were just mystified by the entire ordeal. Swept it under the rug. Cops tried to track down the manufacturer of the erection pill, but there was no number or address on the package. And the gas station clerk said I had the only packet, doesn’t even know how it landed in his store. Never carried it before, he said.

Nowadays, I’m lonelier than a lost dog looking for his owner. I’m unable to experience pleasure down below. But maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe I was meant to ride this earth alone for the rest of my days. At least, I don’t have to waste energy getting hard.
