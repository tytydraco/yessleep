The new mayor of our town was elected almost a year ago now. The elections always come with some organisation and preparation, but the rules are rather simple. You can vote on a party or you can vote on a person. The person with the most votes, notwithstanding whether he belongs to the largest party or not, becomes mayor. No questions asked. And our mayor became mister Martin.

Mister Martin was a courteous, very well-groomed but also charismatic man and beloved by many people. Sure, there were a few who were not 100% behind his political agenda, but none of them really hated, let alone despised him. Because of his courtesy, he had no trouble putting together a coalition and making the city governable again. The city council got off with a smooth start: proposals to give vacant properties new life were approved, funding was gathered successfully to renovate the local hospital and initial building plans have also been made for a new primary school. Although there was still one big thorn in the mayor's side and that was the 127-year old cemetery which had fallen into disuse. None of the residents still had close relatives buried there. An agreement was drawn up that the remains would be exhumed. Later, a park would then come in its place. Out of respect, however, and for those who wished, a ceremony would be held on november 19th last year.

However, the ceremony never took place. I spoke to a friend of mine who has a seat in the council and he told me that excavation of the remains had already ceased after one day. I asked him what he thought that could be the cause. Had they found bomb from the first or second world war? Were there budgetary issues which made that the excavation could not continue?

All he could tell me is that he had no record of that. A possible new date for the ceremony was also not communicated. Normally I let these things pass me by, but rumours are rising all over town. The story that recurs most often is that people, when they drive past the cemetery at night, see the figure of a man with a long, leather coat wearing a hat. He would apparently always carry binoculars and a large flash light with him. They soon give the man a name: "Grave Eye". Apart from that no one actually knows who he is. A rare few dared to speak to him but they didn't get much out of him. "None of your business. Go home safely" , he said. Apparently he kept repeating that until you actually went home.

As always, the cemetery was closed at night, but not long after Grave Eye appeared during the evenings, they closed it during the day too. Apparently, some people thought the mystique surrounding the cemetery had something to do with a rich family supposedly lying there with pots full of gold and they brought their shovels.

A week before Christmas, it was probably one of the most disturbing nights my otherwise quiet town has ever known.

From what I heard afterward it started around 11 PM, people who lived within a few meters of the cemetery suddenly heard multiple loud and out-of-sync wailings. Multiple  residents came closer to its gates and started shouting on what was going on to the man in the long coat. He did respond in his usual way: "None of your business. Go home safely." I remember a text from a friend explaining how messed up things were. By the time I arrived there, he and a whole crowd was standing in front of the gate. The screeching was still audible and went on almost continuously. I saw some who were shrouded in their dressing gowns awakened from sleep by the murmur. There was also already a police patrol keeping the crowd at bay. They requested people to return to their homes. The crowd refused, not until they knew what was going on. They asked the police about Grave Eye and if he was with them. The police acknowledged that. They kept repeating their message for the gathering to go back to their homes.

Later that night, the mayor arrived. He struggled to pass by the crowd until he finally reached the cemetery gates. He and Grave Eye were whispering things in each other's ears. Until the mayor finally nodded and turned his head back to the crowd. He asked a police officer for his megaphone and pled the crowd to fulfil the police's request. He tried to comfort us by telling that the police suspect that these are just loiterers that want to scare people in the neighbourhood. He added:

"Nothing severe, people. Go home, sleep tight."

It was a cue for most to let the matter rest for now. Some were still worried, but the mayor briefly took the time to talk to them. I also spoke to him, but I couldn't get more information out of him than what he told others. He said some annoying fellas became an emerging problem in the town, but that the board was currently looking at how to address this.

In the evening, the next day, the local bar was packed with people. I've never seen anything like it. By entering the bar I heard a woman shouting: "I've seen it. I've seen him: mayor Martin, together with deputy mayor Haze and two others. They were carrying children covered in black blankets." While the crowd continued discussing, smartphones were going around the caf√©, with on it photos that had to serve as evidence. I have seen the pictures and although it looks like each of the four individuals are carrying something, it was really difficult what it exactly was. As it was also difficult to determine if two of the four individuals were indeed mayor Martin and deputy mayor Haze. I got my hands on another picture that was taken from a different perspective. On this I could see down below in the photo only the heads, though unrecognisable, but when I zoomed in I saw something orange-glowing, like a fire.

Through the people and the local press, the mayor was confronted with the images but outed them as being mass hysteria. He stuck to the story that it was problem youths who had run amok. He did add that the cemetery would not be cleared yet, nor did he give a date when it would be done in the future.

Most folks don't know what to think about this story. They have the feeling that they are not allowed the truth.

As for me, I just hope our mayor isn't in some nasty business...
