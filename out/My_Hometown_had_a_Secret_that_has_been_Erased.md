   Most kids are given little areas for them to grow and learn to be people, but not us.  Our city didn’t have the budget for personal development, so it gave us abandoned houses and vacant lots.  They were horrible hand-me-downs.   42 Cuckoo Bird Ln was one of those places that seemed to give us a place to hang plus collect memories.    

   Cathy found my house familiar and would revert to an introverted mindset and barely spoke and hid in her room as if I were an estranged uncle.  It’s something I had gotten used to and planned to do some soul searching in my old town. 

   Once in the house, I pointed upstairs so Cathy could run to the guestroom and pretend that no one in the house existed.  My mom gave me a hug that could make the toughest man cry as if his dog died, and my father came down and spun me around and told me to get ready for dinner.   

   I made my way upstairs and glanced in my brother’s room, where he was spying on the neighbors with his binoculars.  I passed Cathy’s room, which was locked and blaring My Chemical Romance, and made my way to my room which impressed me with how similar it looked to when I left twenty-five years ago. 

   I went downstairs and sat at the secondary table.  My parents made small talk with my uncle while I finished my potatoes and made my plans to sneak out.  I went to the backyard only to run into dad as he was grabbing another beer.   

“Hey bud!  Watcha doing?” 

“Hey.  I was just thinking of going for a walk to check out the old neighborhood,” 

“Ya might be too late.” 

Dad grabbed his beer and walked inside without giving me another look.  I left out the side gate. 

I recognized the cracked facade with all its manholes, shattered windows, and the gangs of children mowing about.  Somethings never change, and I don’t feel very bad about that.  I take another turn and hear that old dog that used to growl at me every time I moved a muscle near that house.  Somehow, the dog's growl felt deeper and more deliberate, as if he’d been waiting for me for some delusional revenge.  Its fangs reminded me ‘Cujo’.  I fought the urge to get a sandwich at ‘Pat’s Deli’ and made my way to the front steps of 42 Cuckoo Bird Ln.  Worse than I remember. 

   I jumped into the old shack of a building to search for the old hole where I’d speak with Martha and hear stories of this town when she was young and in love with a man who joined the service.  Her fiancé was considered missing in action and the grief caused her to spiral into homelessness.  She took refuge at this address. 

 

\*\*\*\* 

   I left the safety of my group and knocked on a door near a wide dark hole.  She spoke. 

   “I’ve been here for twenty years.  I enjoy some of the people who come here.  Even though, none of them notice me.” 

“Why don’t you leave?” 

“I wouldn’t know how to reenter society.  There are rules that change every so often.  I have been gone for a whole generation.....I would be lost out there.” 

“I’m sure the rules haven’t changed that much.  Where still the same place.” 

“No, you’re not.  You just aren’t old enough to know better.  I didn’t just hide.  I have not so much as read a newspaper.  I don’t even know what it looks like outside.” 

“It’s a bit rundown out there.” 

“Do they still have those beautiful hedges out front?  I know things started to look shabby, but certainly not everything?” 

“Eh.  The town’s sort of rundown.  At least, this part of town.  My dad wanted a bargain, so he chose the cul-de-sac with an abandoned car and a rundown house.” 

“That’s a shame.  I know we weren’t the prettiest town, but I always enjoyed the peace of this place.” 

“With all the people leaving, there’s more peace than you could ever ask for.” 

\*\*\*\* 

The hole is gone.  I knocked on the door to see if she was behind the door, when I felt a tap on my shoulder. 

“Can I help you?” 

“I’m looking for someone.” 

“You need to check at the front desk.” 

I walk back to the front and ring the bell. 

“Can I help you?” 

“I’m looking for Martha.” 

“Do you have a last name or room number?” 

“Uh....She’s staying around the corner.  It was the room that had a hole in it.” 

“That no longer exists.” 

“.............” 

“You can’t go back.” 

Something told me I shouldn’t be here.  I stumbled out the glass doors, and down the tiled steps and looked back to observe the fancy hotel that stood in the place of the old shack that carried my old things. 

   I made my way back to my father’s house, passing the new houses built for the new tech employees, and the apartment buildings made to look rustic.  I peaked at the cafe that replaced the greasy deli I’d be at after school.  I opened my dad’s new Mohogany door and saw Cathy saying goodbye to my family.  My dad smiled at me. 

“Find what you were looking for?” 

“No.” 

“I told ya.” 

   Cathy and I walked past the ‘For Sale’ sign and jumped in the car.   

“Are you feeling better?” 

I looked at Cathy and smiled as a response.  As we drove past the new coffee shop on the corner, I had the thought that I’d never feel better.  You can’t get closure when the place doesn’t exist.
