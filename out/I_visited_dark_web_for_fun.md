It started as curiosity. A few clicks, a “what if,” and suddenly I was deep in the shadowy corners of the internet. Just one browser tab. Nothing more. I told myself it was harmless—just some edgy thrill.

At first, it was boring. Broken links, dead pages, gibberish text. I laughed at myself. Then, the first pop-up appeared. Small, fast, almost invisible—a single line of text:

"Hello."

I blinked. It vanished before I could read it again. My pulse quickened. I double-checked the tab. Nothing. I shrugged it off. Probably an ad glitch, some leftover script.

Then, my webcam light flickered. I froze. Nothing should have been using the camera. I hovered my cursor over the icon—nothing. No application running. Just me, and the quiet hum of my laptop.

I told myself it was nothing.

The next morning, my phone buzzed while it was locked. Notification preview:

"I see you."

No app name. No number. Just those two words. I laughed nervously. Probably spam.

But then it happened everywhere. Files I hadn’t touched were open. Browser tabs I didn’t recall were active for milliseconds, disappearing before I could click. Text documents contained odd sentences I didn’t remember typing:

"Don’t look away."

I checked every security setting. Firewall, antivirus, camera cover—everything normal. No signs of intrusion. Yet, every evening, the anomalies grew. Cursor moving slightly on its own. Volume adjusting up and down. Phone opening apps when untouched.

I tried unplugging. Hard reset. Factory reset. Safe mode. Everything returned to normal. Or at least it seemed normal. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

Then I started noticing the shadows. Not in my room—but in my devices. Backgrounds that shifted subtly, icons that weren’t where I left them, browser history that included sites I didn’t visit. My own digital life was… watching me back.

One night, I swore I heard my notification ping when nothing was open. I glanced at the laptop. Webcam light on. No program running. And then, the cursor moved. Slowly, deliberately, across the screen.

It typed a single message:

"Look up."

My head snapped toward the ceiling. Nothing. No one. Just my dimly lit apartment. My pulse roared.

I returned to the laptop. The message had changed:

"Closer."

I don’t know how long I sat there, frozen, every nerve screaming. I couldn’t close the laptop, couldn’t turn it off, couldn’t even move my hands. It felt alive. Watching. Waiting. Learning.

Then my phone buzzed. I glanced at the screen. Nothing—except the flashlight turned on by itself. Blinding me. I spun around. The light reflected off every surface. My own eyes stared back at me… only, for a split second, they weren’t mine.

The next morning, everything seemed normal. Laptop. Phone. Room. My reflection in the window. Safe.

I tried to rationalize: stress, lack of sleep, too many horror stories online. Just imagination.

But every day since… small things happen. Files slightly moved. Notifications disappearing. Webcam light flickering for no reason. Phone apps opening themselves. I’ve even caught myself performing actions I don’t remember initiating.

And now, whenever I open my browser—even a safe one—I swear I see a cursor hovering over the tabs I don’t want it to. Hovering. Waiting.

I don’t know if I’m being hacked, or if… something else followed me back from that tab.

I don’t touch the dark web anymore. I don’t browse. I barely use my laptop. And yet, I can’t shake the feeling that it’s still watching.

Sometimes, when I look at my devices, I feel like I’m not the one in control anymore.

I’m writing this because… someone has to know
