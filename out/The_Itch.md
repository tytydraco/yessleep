It all started with a crack. It always starts with a crack. A minor imperfection that catches your attention during those brief moments on autopilot. For me, it happened while I was putting away laundry. 

I was going through the house. Upstairs to downstairs, kitchen to bedroom to bathroom to basement with folded clothes and towels in hand. That's when I noticed it. 

At first, I thought it was a trick of the light. Shadows messing with my vision. I continued towards the stairs but stopped short, curious for an answer. 

It's that feeling, you know. The one when something is off. Lying in bed at night, trying to remember if you locked all the doors or turned off the stove burners. Sitting in your car after work, wondering who you forgot to call. A word you just can't place. A memory you have the faintest recollection of. An itch needing to be scratched. 

So, I turned around and retreated down the hall. At the end, there's a light switch and mirror. Old antique thing my wife inherited from her grandfather, or maybe a distant cousin. Hard to say. Just something to fill the space. To make our house look a little less empty. 

The space between the mirror and the light switch had a piece of chipped paint. A small fleck of plaster had somehow come undone. Nothing crazy, I know. Happens all the time, especially in a house as old as ours. But it bugged me. 

I tried to laugh it off. Wave it away and return to my chores before my wife got home, but I couldn't forget about it. I walked two or three steps, and I could just feel the back of my head burning. An itch needing to be scratched. 

So, I went back to the wall and placed my fingernail against the jagged edge of chipped paint. Gently, I flexed my finger up and down, rubbing at the rim, slowly peeling it away. But you know how these things go. 

Little.by little, I started picking and pulling and prizing the paint away from the wall. A tedious task that I made faster with a flat-edge pizza cutter from the kitchen. I'm not much of a handyman, to my wife's chagrin, and I quickly realized I'd picked the wrong tool for the job. 

I went back to the kitchen and exchanged my pizza cutter for a knife. The process picked up some. I was peeling away entire strips of eggshell white paint. The more I peeled, the more jagged edges I found. The more I cut away, the more bubbles formed in the paint. I came to the conclusion that I would just have to do away with it all and re-paint the wall later on the weekend. 

But the tedious process was killing me. Figuratively speaking. 

In the basement, with all the tools I'd amassed over the years from friends and family, I found a metal scraper. I went back upstairs and dug in until most of the back wall was without paint.

There was a great deal of satisfaction there, I must admit, but as soon as I put my scraper down, I realized that there was a small crack in the drywall beneath. Same place as before, directly centered between the mirror and light switch. 

I thought about filling it with plaster or glue, or hell, maybe even enough latex paint would fill the gaps. But the very idea of that made my skin crawl. It wasn't right. It seemed insufficient, indecent, distasteful. No, it too had to be done away with. 

Backtracking downstairs, I went into my wife's studio and retrieved a small chisel from one of the dresser drawers. Like Andy Dufraine, I started etching and carving and digging my way through. 

Small chunks of plaster fell to the floor. Pockets of dust wafted with every stab, every incision. My eyes were starting to sting, but I couldn't pull myself away from my work long enough to grab a pair of goggles. I just kept chiseling, squinting against the debris. Much like before, my patience got the best of me. I couldn't stand how tedious it was, the amount of time it required. 

From under the kitchen sink, I grabbed a hammer. The drywall crumbled and collapsed with a number of swings. This too was, in its own way, satisfying. But still, a few pieces remained nailed to the studs. I ripped them off and tossed them aside. 

Stepping back, I admired my work. I could see the internal wires and pipes. The insulation in between each stud. Could smell the musty dew that reminded me of my father's truck. He was a farmer, never had time to clean his truck, and within a few years, it was less of a truck and more of an ecosystem for pests. Mice especially 

You could always hear them rattling around in between the metal panels whenever Dad got the engine going over forty-five. Squeaking in panic as their entire world shook apart. 

My satisfaction from a job well done was short-lived. When my wife came home...well, to put it simply, she wasn't happy. We had a very long discussion about my actions. There were accusations of being drunk or high or having lost my mind. 

I knew without a shadow of a doubt that at least two of those were not plausible possibilities. I only drink on the weekends, and I've never done any drugs other than smoking some weed back in college. 

My mind, my sanity to put it more appropriately, was a questionable matter. One that, realistically, I could not make a determination about without expressing some sort of noticeable bias. 

In the end, my wife was willing to chalk up the situation to a "heat of the moment" kind of thing. Impulsive thinking. Irrational behavior that occurs at odd intervals, a problem plenty of people experience on a daily basis. To put it in simpler terms: "a dumbass being a jackass." 

She helped me sweep up the mess and take out the garbage. I called a local carpenter and booked a time for them to come out and fix the wall. My wife made dinner while I showered. We ate in silence, her disbelief somewhere between concerned and amused. After, I washed dishes while she dried. Regular night in spite of what had happened. 

After that, we went downstairs and sat on the couch to watch TV. But if I'm to be honest, I couldn't focus on any of the shows. Couldn't tell you what we talked about, or if we even talked at all. 

I was too busy thinking about the chipped paint, the crack in the drywall, the grooves in the floorboards and the spaces in between. About the indents of our textured ceiling. A tacky popcorn look of jagged ridges and bumps. I kept thinking about the small squeak of the second step on the stairs. The hollow moan of the draft in the bedroom. The sound of the mice in my father's truck, rattling against the loose panels. 

But I couldn't tell my wife about it. At least, not in a way that would make sense. 

Honestly, I was getting worked up. I could literally feel my skin crawling about it. As if there were maggots in the narrow space between bone and flesh, interspersed with my muscles and tissue. Worms wriggling beneath the surface. 

I snapped out of my fit when my wife turned off the TV and asked if I was ready for bed. I almost laughed because how the hell was I supposed to go to bed? This wasn't the kind of issue where you just count sheep or clear your mind or listen to rain sounds on YouTube. It felt permanent, detrimental. But I had no plausible excuses, no rational explanations. So, I nodded my head and followed her upstairs. 

For about an hour or so, I lay in bed beside my wife, listening to her snore. Feeling the gentle rhythmic motion of her chest raising and lowering with every breath. Occasionally, the heat kicked on to help dispel the silence. But still, I could hear it. I could hear the quiet, the soft buzz of nothing in my ears. That flurry of emptiness like a light snowfall in the dark of night. 

Sighing, I climbed out of bed and stepped into the hall. To resist the urge to look at the wall was perhaps the hardest thing in my entire life. I was a child trying not to admit their mistake, hoping that if maybe I ignored it long enough, it would suddenly disappear. 

I walked into the bathroom and closed the door behind me. I used the toilet, washed my hands thoroughly, but it still felt like there was some residue on them. So, I washed them again, applying an extra lather of soap. 

Then, I just stared at myself in the mirror. I was almost afraid to go back out into the hall because I knew that if I glimpsed the wall, I wouldn't be able to walk away again. Wouldn't be able to ignore it. I was just biding my time, trying to build up a tolerance of sorts. Psyching myself up for possibly the most mundane battle in existence. 

Just as I was about to leave, I noticed something in my reflection. A small dot on my forehead. 

At first, I thought it was a mosquito bite or a spider bite, but as I leaned in closer to inspect, I recognized it as a pimple. Hadn't seen many of those since my college days. Let me tell you, it was not a sight I missed. 

I positioned my index fingers, one on either side, and pushed them together. A small spot of white pus came slithering out, and I wiped it onto a piece of tissue paper, tossing it into the bin. But for some reason, I wasn't convinced I'd gotten it all. Pimples always had a way of producing more fluid. 

So, I repeated the process, putting a finger on opposite sides and squeezing. More pus came, followed by a yellowish transparent fluid. I applied more pressure until it hurt. This time, a small dot of blood came out instead. 

Finally, I thought with a hint of relief. 

I turned on the tap, wetted my fingers, and wiped the blood away. Then, I opened the medicine cabinet and grabbed a small bandage. Peeling away the disposable paper, I glanced into the mirror again. Instantly, my eyes went to that small bump on my forehead. Flushed red with blood beneath the skin. Somehow bigger than before. Swollen by my interference. 

Ugly little thing. 

Just ignore it, I told myself. 

But it was there. That gnawing at the back of my mind. Unfinished business. An itch needing to be scratched. 

My mother used to tell me never to pop my pimples or pick at my scars. She would've been disappointed then because that's exactly what I did. I started picking at it with my fingernails, digging a small gouge in my forehead. But it wasn't enough. My tools were insufficient. I grabbed a pair of tweezers from the cabinet and pushed the metal tips beneath the skin, scraping away the stringy bits underneath. The remnants of pus and hair and oil and blood and all that built-up grime. 

When my patience had run thin, I snuck downstairs into the garage for a piece of sandpaper. I rubbed the skin raw; ignored the pain that ensued. Because more than that stinging sensation was an overwhelming dissatisfaction. A possessive feeling that slowly consumed me whole. But even it was paltry in comparison to the itch at the back of my mind. 

In the end, when my piece of sandpaper was worn dull, I returned upstairs and grabbed the cheese grater from the kitchen. Then, I locked myself in the bathroom. 

The pimple had become a vulgar mess of blood and raw skin. A hole in my flesh about the diameter of a golf ball. 

Putting the cheese grater to my forehead, I took a deep breath and exhaled. The itch needed to be scratched. And while I was cognizant of my actions, of the irrationality behind them, I just couldn't stop myself. Couldn't help myself from continuing this little conquest. 

My wife started knocking on the door, and when I didn't respond, she began pounding her fists against the wood. Rattling the door in its frame, making the hinges jiggle and squeal. Sort of like those mice in my father's truck. 

She called my name over and over. I had no words, no answers, no explanations. There was just the sound of the cheese grater scraping against my skull. Tearing away the skin in an attempt to unravel what laid beneath. 

It's a dangerous thing, focusing on the imperfections in life. To think about an itch. Once you start thinking about it, once you realize its presence, it just doesn't want to go away. And any mention of it has this neurological reaction, this incessant urge to scratch. 

But I intend to get rid of my itch, and I won't stop scratching until it's gone.
