I never believed in curses. I used to think they were relics of another age, superstitions whispered by the gullible, something you’d hear old ladies murmur under their breath in forgotten alleyways. But I’ve learned now that some things—some songs—are more than just melodies and words. They’re doorways, traps, even weapons.

If you had told me last month that a salsa song could change everything, I’d have laughed. God, I wish I could go back to that naive version of myself. I wish I’d never heard “Brujeria.”

It began innocently enough. I had just come off a brutal shift at the bar. The customers were unusually restless that night; every order felt like a battle, and my feet ached from running back and forth. All I wanted was a quiet night with a drink in hand and the television droning in the background. I was on my way home, dragging myself along cracked pavement, when my phone buzzed.

Carlos.

He was an old friend, the kind who always had a new conspiracy theory, a new obsession to chase. His text was brief, just five words: *“Come over. Got something crazy.”* I sighed, hesitating. Normally, I'd ignore this kind of bait, but I felt drawn to it. Maybe it was the exhaustion or the sheer monotony of my life, but something in me needed… a break from the ordinary.

When I got to Carlos’s apartment, I felt an immediate tension in the air. It was too quiet for one of his gatherings. The hallway was dimly lit, and the sound of distant salsa music echoed down the corridor, mixed with low murmurs and the occasional laugh. I knocked on his door, and he swung it open with a grin that was just a bit too wide.

“You made it,” he said, his voice tinged with an excitement that made my skin prickle. He looked… different. His eyes were bloodshot, and there was a nervous energy about him, like he’d been waiting for me.

“What’s going on?” I asked, stepping inside. His apartment was unusually dark, lit only by a single lamp in the corner. The air was thick, humid, and carried a faint, acrid smell that I couldn’t quite place.

Carlos closed the door behind me, almost too quickly. “I’ve found something,” he whispered, his eyes darting to the corner of the room where an old record player sat, the turntable spinning slowly. “A record… from Cuba. 1974. A single recording. Rumour is, it’s cursed.”

I rolled my eyes. “A cursed salsa song? Really?”

He nodded eagerly. “Yes, really. ‘Brujeria.’ You won’t find it on Spotify or anywhere online. There are stories about it… weird stories. People disappearing, some going mad. They say the band vanished after recording it. This is the only copy. I had to pay a lot to get my hands on it.”

I wanted to leave right then, but curiosity got the better of me. “Alright,” I muttered. “Let’s hear it.”

Carlos’s grin widened. “You won’t regret this,” he said, though his tone suggested he wasn’t entirely sure. He moved to the corner and carefully lifted the needle. The moment it touched the vinyl, a low, crackling sound filled the room.

The first notes were soft, like a caress, a whisper. The rhythm was slow, hypnotic, unlike any salsa I’d ever heard. It felt almost… alive, like the music was breathing, pulling at the edges of the room, making the shadows dance. And then the voice started. Deep, gravelly, almost a growl, singing in Spanish. I understood enough to catch the words—*“sangre bajo la luna”*—blood under the moon.

A chill ran down my spine. The melody wove itself through the room, wrapping around us like invisible tendrils, pulling us in. I felt a strange pressure building behind my eyes, like a migraine coming on. I blinked, trying to shake the feeling. I looked around, and that’s when I saw her.

A woman in a red dress, standing against the far wall. Her long black hair fell in front of her face, her head slightly tilted. She seemed out of place, like she didn’t belong there. Her lips moved, mouthing the words of the song, but no sound came from her.

I glanced at Carlos, but he was entranced, his eyes wide, staring at the record player. I turned back to the woman. Her gaze was fixed on me now, her eyes dark, hollow, endless. My chest tightened, a sharp pain shooting through my ribs. I tried to breathe, but the air felt thick, suffocating. Her mouth twisted into a smile, slow, sinister, as if she knew something I didn’t.

I couldn’t move. I was frozen, trapped in her gaze. The music grew louder, more urgent. The walls seemed to close in, the shadows thickening, creeping closer. The woman stepped forward, her red dress rustling like leaves in a storm. I could hear a low hum, a whisper that seemed to come from all around me.

Suddenly, the lights flickered. For a moment, the room was plunged into darkness. When the light returned, she was gone. The music stopped, and the silence that followed was deafening. My heart was racing, my skin clammy with sweat. Carlos was grinning, his face alight with some twisted excitement.

“Did you see her?” I whispered, my voice trembling.

Carlos laughed. “That’s the spirit of the song,” he said. “Isn’t it wild?”

I shook my head. “We need to stop this,” I said, feeling a deep, gnawing fear in my gut. “Something’s wrong.”

But Carlos was already reaching for the needle again. “Just one more time,” he insisted, almost pleading. Before I could stop him, he dropped the needle, and the music began again, this time louder, faster. The room felt alive with it, vibrating, pulsing.

The woman was back. She was closer now, her face clearer. Her skin was pale, almost translucent, and her eyes… they weren’t human. They were black, endless voids that seemed to swallow the light. She was staring directly at me, her mouth moving faster, the words silent but insistent.

I tried to back away, but my feet felt like they were glued to the floor. I could feel a coldness spreading up my legs, like ice creeping through my veins. I wanted to scream, but no sound came out. Her hand reached out, slender fingers stretching toward me.

And then, everything exploded.

The room was filled with a deafening roar, a blast of light so bright it seared my vision. I heard Carlos scream, a sound filled with pain and terror. I felt a force hit me, hard, knocking me to the ground. I lay there, dazed, my ears ringing, my vision blurred. The air was thick with smoke, the acrid smell of something burning.

I pushed myself up, coughing, blinking through the haze. The record player was shattered, pieces scattered across the floor. Carlos was on his knees, clutching his head, blood trickling down his face. The woman was gone, but I could still feel her presence, like a weight pressing down on my chest.

“Carlos!” I shouted, my voice raw, ragged. “We need to get out of here!”

He didn’t respond. He just stared at me, his eyes wide, filled with a fear I’d never seen before. His lips moved, but no sound came out. He pointed behind me, his hand trembling.

I turned slowly, my heart pounding. There, in the corner, where the record player had been, was a shadow. It was tall, thin, impossibly black, darker than the darkest night. It seemed to pulse, to breathe, like it was alive. I could feel its eyes on me, could feel its hatred, its hunger.

I backed away, my hands shaking. “What the hell is that?” I whispered.

Carlos finally found his voice. “It’s not the song,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “It’s what the song was keeping out.”

I didn’t wait to hear more. I grabbed Carlos by the arm and dragged him to the door. We stumbled into the hallway, slamming the door behind us. The music had stopped, but I could still hear it, faint, like a distant echo in my mind.

We ran, down the stairs, out into the street, into the cold night air. My breath was coming in short gasps, my heart racing. I turned to Carlos. “What the hell was that?” I demanded.

He shook his head, his face pale, his eyes wide. “I don’t know,” he whispered. “But we need to destroy that record.”

We drove in silence to my apartment, my hands gripping the wheel so tight my knuckles were white. I felt like something was watching us, following us, but every time I glanced in the mirror, there was nothing. Just the dark, empty streets.

We burst into my place, slamming the door shut, locking it tight. I grabbed my phone and started frantically searching for any information about the song. But there was nothing. No history, no details. Just rumours, ghost stories, half-remembered whispers.

And then I heard it again. The music. Soft, distant, but unmistakable. My phone screen flickered, then died. The lights in the apartment dimmed, then went out. I heard a soft tapping sound, like fingers drumming on glass.

I turned slowly, and there she was, outside the window, her face pressed against the glass, her black eyes staring into mine, her lips moving soundlessly. And I knew then… the song wasn’t cursed. It was a warning. A shield.

And it was gone.

I heard the tapping grow louder, more insistent. Carlos grabbed my arm, his grip tight, his face pale with fear. “We need to find another copy,” he whispered. “We need to play it again.”

But I knew, deep down, that it wouldn’t be that simple. Because whatever the song had been holding back was here now, with us, in the dark. And I didn’t know if we could keep it out.

For now.
