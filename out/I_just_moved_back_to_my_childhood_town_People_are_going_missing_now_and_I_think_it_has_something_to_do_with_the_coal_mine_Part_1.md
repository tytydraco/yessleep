 People have been going missing in my hometown ever since I moved back. And things don't really feel the way they did when I was a kid. I don't know if those two are related.

This has been really nagging at me lately. I had no idea where to post it to get some help or peace of mind. I just really need some support right now before I drive myself crazy over it. Maybe I'm overreacting because it's been a stressful few months since my parents died, or maybe someone can shed some light on the events that have been happening and show me that I am just being crazy...

I guess, I should probably start by introducing myself? My name is Jeremy Coleridge, as a kid I used to live in a very small coal mining town of about 7000 in a desolate area of the north called Calkirk. Picture every single midwestern small town Podunk you've driven to on your way to a bigger city, and you would be pretty close to what Calkirk looks like

I was there until I was about 17, when I decided to live with my aunt in New York, where I threw away a lot of money going into journalism which, if I have to be honest, was probably the worst decision of my life at the time. But, with my parent's kind of disowning me for not agreeing with their very strong religious devotions I kind of had no place to go. My aunt pushed me to attend college a year after I graduated high school because I really liked writing and investigation, so what better to study than investigative journalism right? Plus; she said I had to be in school if she was going to let me stay with her. Well, do you want to know how many investigative journalists are in New York?

The answer is: A lot.

So, a few grand down and four years of school wasted, I can’t get a job with that degree. I ended up living in a 2-bedroom apartment bunking with another dude while I work 50 hours a week between two part time jobs because that’s all anyone wanted to offer, and I was struggling. My aunt Clair moved back to Calkirk to take care of my mom who was diagnosed with some rare disease that she wouldn’t tell me about. Now, I’m 24, my mom passed away 3 months ago from whatever disease it was that she had gotten, my dad committed suicide the next day…

My aunt paid for me to fly back to Calkirk for the funeral and the Will reading. Being their only kid, I guess my parents willed me their small 3-bedroom one bath house in the town and with that, a small inheritance that basically would pay my student loans off and still leave me a few grand of left over money to put in savings. The life insurance my dad had from working at the Calkirk mine for almost 40 years paid everything off. I wouldn’t owe a cent on a single thing except my utilities and food.

I had to go back to New York for a few weeks to get my assets in order. I waited for my roommates to find some new, desperate fool to move in, sold my old buick, sent off the final check for my bank to cover my loan, flipped off one boss as I walked out of one job, and gave a respectable 2 weeks notice to the other, then I paid a company to pack up my small amount of crap I had and bought myself a plane ticket back to Calkirk.

Well, I say “to Calkirk” but as you may or may not know, a town of 7000 doesn’t usually have an airport so I had to fly into a city about two hours from there and get my aunt to agree to pick me up.

Two weeks living in the house, I got bored sitting in the place alone and decided to apply for a few jobs in town. I was able to score a job at the Calkirk Times. And being the only news outlet in Calkirk, business was actually booming. But when I asked my interviewer why the position was open, he said something that sort of freaked me out.

“Well, the last kid with your job stopped showing up a couple weeks ago…his house is empty, skipped town, no one can find him...”

I was basically hired on the spot, and I accepted immediately, call me desperate. But what my new boss said gave me a weird feeling… Everyone knew about everyone in this town. How could one of only three journalists go missing and nobody knows where he went?

When I met my new coworkers Abbigale and Tommy, they said the guy, Jim Remus, was an out-of-towner from Texas who came to live here with his girlfriend, a local girl we went to school with. They both went missing two weeks ago with no sign of them anywhere. Abby and Tommy, both thought it was way weirder than what our boss thought, he denied any articles even mentioning it. He even reprimanded Tom for asking another coworker about it, saying it was personal business and we shouldn’t be talking about it at work...

The second weird thing I experienced was a couple weeks after that, when I officially emptied my parents' pantry of all the nasty old people food they had. I decided it was probably time to go grocery shopping. I got home late on Friday night after writing a pointless article about news that had come out almost a week previously in bigger outlets, but people here ate up the content like it was breaking news so, who cares. I decided Saturday would be a better time to go grocery shopping.

Now, let me explain Calkirk a little better before the next piece of my story. Like I said, Calkirk is an old mining town in the Midwest part of the United States. I’m not saying where because I don’t want anyone trying to find it and something bad happening to them.

The town sits a few miles from the highway and has one main road with everything that’s not a house on it. Two gas stations, one on each side of town, two bars barely 3 blocks away from each other, the post office, the fire hall, the grocery store on one side, the K through 12 school on the other, then there are a few buildings with random business scattered between, a small vet clinic, a photo lab, a small coffee shop, stuff like that. The jail sat smack dab in the middle of town between the two bars. The town itself probably wouldn’t be visible from the highway if the factory wasn’t billowing out thick clouds of what I assumed to be coal ash and soot 24/7.

The factory was supplied by the Calkirk Mines and a tunnel delivery system had been made to transport coal to the factory from the mine about 15 miles away. The mine sat in a deep coolie with hundreds of trees around it, near a river, and a few long dirt trails in and out. The tunnel system was a long belt covered most of the way by piping. Inside, there's train cars that run almost constantly to the factory. With only small viewing ports for maintenance every so often. All of this knowledge was thanks to my dad working there for 40 years and a few take-your-child to workdays before he and my mom basically disowned me.

I should also mention before I get too far, since I came back here about 8 weeks ago, there have been three massive dustings, which the locals call “Ash events”. An Ash event in this town is when the factory spouts out way more of its black smoke than usual and the town gets covered in layers of black soot like material, it’s easily washed away with a hose and the fire department goes around each time and uses a low-pressure hose to rinse basically everything off. I remember these events from when I was a kid, but they never happened this frequently, at least not in my memory, or maybe it was washed off before I noticed.

It usually happened overnight and if you woke up too early, you'd have to wash off your own cars if you want to get anywhere. Part of the city ordinance was no one drives in town with their cars covered in the ash. It can be met with an almost $2000 fine. And, with the amount of police officers with not much to do all day, they were posted everywhere after a good dusting, so you’d be seen.

The first Ash event since being back home happened about two weeks after I got to town, two weeks before I got my new job. The second ash event two weeks after that got my dad's truck that I had parked outside so I could work on a dirt bike in the garage when I was bored. It happened the night I decided to go grocery shopping. The third one was just a week ago as I’m writing this...

Anyway, when I woke up, I could smell the ash in the air. It leaves this really heavy burning smell like someone burning ham bones with wool. It's hard to explain, but it's one of those smells you could remember from anywhere if you smelled it again. When I walked out, I already knew what I’d see, the dark dust caked on my dad's truck. I unraveled the hose in the front yard and sprayed the whole truck down before heading to the store to get there right when they opened. And yeah, I realize most people would look at this and say, that's weird, but for Calkirk, you kind of just grew up doing that. It's a generational habit, everyone did it.

In the store, I shopped for about two hours, packed a cart full of groceries and went to the registers to check out. Two older ladies were sitting at a small booth beside the windows sipping coffee. I recognized them as ladies that live in my neighborhood that would often have contact with my parents and I when I was a kid.

“Did you see Genie this morning?” I overheard one say, the other shook her head and made an exasperated face.

“I was just gonna ask you, haven't seen her at all!”

“That’s so unlike her…”

“Do you think…” There was a pause and the other shook her head.

I listened as they went back and forth saying how this lady always met them on Saturday mornings, every year for the past 25 years, she never missed a day.

I paid, I rolled my cart over to them and said, “I Uh, couldn’t help but overhear, you said your friend is missing?”

The women gave me a skeptical look then both suddenly perked in an almost robotic manner then one smiled, “Oh, little Jeremy Coleridge, you sweet little thing, when did you get back in town!”

I responded with “Like 2 months ago…”

“So sorry about your parents dear. Hope the town is treating you well.”

I nodded, but like a lot of crap in this town, their sudden change in attitude freaked me out.

I tried to divert the conversation back to the missing friend “So Genie…”

“Oh, I remember when you were just a tiny baby waddling over to my house for candies with your mom!” One spoke.

“Yeah, I did. But I want to ask about your friend…” I began again.

“Oh worse, as a kid he would follow my granddaughter for hours outside while they played.” The other said. She waved her hand at the other, “You two are about the same age, you should remember her, her name is Abbigale.”

“Oh and what about that time Marty found him playing in the mud puddle in the backyard.”

“Listen” I said abruptly over their talking. “I’m with the newspaper now. You said your friend is missing, have you gone to her house yet!? Have you checked on her at all?”

Their moods changed again, they frowned deeply, and went rigid for a minute as if they were really mad… Then they suddenly smiled again, big wide creepy smiles that *really* freaked me out.

“She’s fine Jeremy.” One said in a tight-lipped smile. “Just… resting…” her creepy smile widened, her lip twitched at the word ‘Resting’. Then, she shoo’ed me away with her hand without another word. My attempts to ask after were ignored as if I wasn’t even there.

Feeling thoroughly unsettled, I left the store, packed my stuff in my truck, and drove it home. I put everything away and pulled out an old phone book my parents had in the house. The only Genie I knew was Genie Carlson. She worked at the school as a nurse for a long time before retiring. I found her number, dialed it, no answer. I dialed it again, same thing. On the third call, the ringer was cut after 2 rings and flipped to voicemail, like someone had sent the phone to the answering machine. “This is Genie Carlson, Sorry I missed you… Please leave a-” but it cut itself off. The next call didn’t go through, I just got a “The number you dialed is no longer in service…” I thought it was odd that her phone would go off after I had just called it three times.

I, at least, remembered where Genie lived from my childhood and decided I’d pay her a small visit before going about the day just to make sure she was okay. I mean, maybe she was sick or something and just stuck in bed, or maybe she fell and needed help? Maybe she didn’t have a life alert, she for sure did not have a cell phone, and I think she was a widow, and all her kid's left town when they turned 18. So, if her friends hadn’t checked in on her she could have been lying there alone for lord knows how long needing help.

When I got to her house it was really dark, and quiet, the only way I knew it was still her house was the name inside the mailbox lid said “Carlson”. I knocked on the door, waited for a bit, but nothing happened.

“Ms. Genie! Ms. Genie! It’s me, Jeremy Coleridge! Jan and Cals son!” There was no answer. I looked in the little window in the door, but it was dark. I stepped to the side and looked into the front window and found an empty house. Her porch had signs that the Ash Event was never cleaned up properly, but the blanket of ash was disturbed by boot marks that weren’t my own. I tried the door handle, it opened, but almost like something pulled it open from the inside.

The house was completely empty, except for large boot marks made of the black ash from the porch leading into the entryway. And a few small blood splatters on the wall beside the stairs. It was eerily quiet; the house didn’t creak the way old houses were supposed to creak. There didn’t even seem to be wind around me. The whole area, inside Genie's house and outside, was just still and silent.

Before I took another step, I called the jail and asked if they could send a cop. I told them that it looked like something weird went down at Ms. Genie’s. They told me to wait outside and not touch anything. So, I turned right on my heel and planted myself on the step of the porch. I pulled out my phone to distract myself from the scene behind me. It didn’t keep my leg from shaking though…

Sheriff Nixon showed up about 10 minutes later. He was old, looked like a corpse himself, but he had been the Sheriff in town since before I could even remember. He was always super friendly and had a smile on his face, even now while responding to a potential disappearance.

“Little Jer Coleridge. My, my son, you’ve *grown.*” He patted my shoulder hard, almost threw me off balance.

“Hey Pat… I think something happened with Genie Carlson…” I pointed to the door, thinking he would be more surprised than what he was.

“Now, *why* would ya‘ think that, son?”

I told him I saw Ruth and Beth Anne at the grocery store saying they hadn’t seen her today. I even told him about them saying she was “Resting” and how they smiled the whole time, not acting like they were really bothered by it at all.

“Well, let’s just take a look here then. Wait out here.” He went inside with a flashlight, looked around for a few minutes then came back out. He clicked the lock behind him and shut the door.

“Well Jer, looks to me Genie moved out.”

“Without telling Ruth and Beth Anne?”

He nodded and his face suddenly smiled widely, the same way Ruth and Beth Anne had done at the grocery store earlier in the day when I kept pressing them to tell me about Genie. “Looks like it.”

“But the boot prints, and blood…”

“Probably a movin’ accident.”

I shook my head at him, trying to talk some reason into him. That didn’t make sense at all. “Pat… Genie is in her 80s. Why would she just leave without telling anyone? Genie has been going to the store every Saturday for 25 years, she hasn’t missed a single day, she wouldn’t just leave without…”

“Now son…” Pat grabbed onto my shoulder and squeezed hard, causing me to pause. He raised an eyebrow at me. “I think you’re reading too much into this. I bet Genie was needin’ a change of pace in her old age, didn't want to hurt herself with the goodbyes.”

“Pat, I don’t think she’d…”

His voice suddenly dropped into an angry tone “Son, I think you’re meddlin’ in people's personal business too much.” He titled his head closer to me. One of his eyes twitched at me, just like how Ruth's had at the grocery store. “Think you need to take your investigative head and go home, forget what you saw here.” He then smiled brightly as if he didn’t say anything and patted my shoulder again. “Nice seein’ ya Jer.” He walked back to his patrol car then tilted his hat at me “I’m sure I’ll be seein’ you around, son.”

I mean, Am I the crazy one? I seem to be the only one who cares that Genie Carlson is missing... Ruth and Beth Anne don't seem to be bothered, and it seems like Sherrif Nixon *couldn't* be bothered. And that's not even getting into the guy who went missing a few weeks ago whose job I took…

The following Monday at work, after finding out Genie Carlson had disappeared, I was typing up an article for a story that broke about a week before. Abby came to my desk, set a cup in front of me while she leaned against the edge and sipped her own. She told me it looked like I hadn’t slept all weekend. I told her I hadn’t.

“Why? What’s up?”

“Well, I saw your grandma and Beth Anne at the store on Saturday, she said that Genie Carlson didn’t meet them this weekend…”

“What? Genie has never missed a Saturday with my grandma…”

“That’s what they said, so I went to check on her, but her house was empty. There were black boot prints in the house and blood on the wall, but when Sheriff Nixon came to look, he said it was nothing and Genie probably moved.”

“She’s 87 years old…”

“That’s what I said… But he didn’t listen to me. He kinda gave me this really weird like… I don’t know, Cheshire Cat sort of smile, and his eye twitched and he just said I was ‘reading too much into this’ and to ‘go home and forget what you saw here’.” I put air quotes around those two. “He brushed it off, like it was some little, petty theft of a candy bar from a kid or something.”

“Sounds like what happened to Jim…” Tom said, walking up to us with his own coffee. He joined Abby leaning against my desk.

“Really?” Our boss had made it seem like Jim and his girlfriend had skipped town.

“Yup. We went to check on him the first day he didn’t come back and there were black smudges all over the place and his house was emptied out, him and his girlfriend gone. Cops told us it was a ‘moving accident’ and told us not to worry.” Abby agreed.

“Isn't that right after the Ash event like a month ago?” Tom asked.

Abby nodded “Yup, He was here on Monday and then just didn’t show up on that Tuesday. We figured maybe he didn’t get his car cleaned and got pulled over or something, but all of our texts went unanswered too… Greg tried to call him for hours. After work, Tom and I went to check in on him and we found their house empty.”

“Don’t you guys think it’s weird? I mean, three people gone, each event their houses were searched by cops who said it was them just moving all the sudden, unexplained blood?”

They shrugged again then Abby sighed heavily. “It is, but we can’t do any research on it. Greg is a hound in the articles, he won’t let even the smallest mention of an ash event or people moving to get published.”

“That’s just weird…”

“Jer, don't worry about it.” Tom said, “If we get caught talking about it we get in trouble.”

There was another half dozen people in the office that were doing whatever it is they all do. If even one heard and snitched on us to Greg we’d all get reprimanded like Tom did when Jim went missing. And I could see Greg heading our way with his morning coffee in his mug. We all gave uncomfortable, knowing looks before we all tightened our lips. He greeted us with a big “Good Morning!” and we responded with the same before we all exchanged another look.

When Greg disappeared around a corner, I turned back to Abby and Tom. “I’m going to look into it a little bit, maybe see if there is something connecting the two…”

“Just don’t let Greg catch you…” Abby shrugged, I nodded.

“I won’t.”

Then they both left to their own workstations and the week continued like normal. Any break I had I would sneak in some research on my phone to avoid Greg being able to look at my history, as well as asking Tom and Abby if they knew anything, trying to see if anything linked Jim Remus, his Girlfriend, who I found out was named Tammy, and Genie Carlson or Bill. I found nothing. No familial relation, they didn’t hang out with the same people, or at the same places. And why would they? Genie was 87, and god knows how old Bill is, and Jim and Tammy are both in their 20s.

It wasn’t until the next Monday that I really started seeing a connection between the disappearances and the Ash Events.

“Did you hear?” Abby asked, setting a coffee on my desk. Tom was close behind her as he scurried to join in on the conversation.

“No?” I questioned. “Hear what?”

“Bill Sanford went missing this weekend.”

“Who?” I asked.

“He was the janitor at the school when we were kids. He worked at the Mine for a while before he had to retire from his RA.” She paused to look around to make sure Greg hadn’t been in the vicinity. When she turned her attention back to us, she looked between Tom and me. “He was supposed to work on Saturday, and he never showed up. My grandma said he is never late or tardy without telling anyone.”

“So… another disappearance.” I sighed and shook my head, crossed my arms over my chest and looked between Abby and Tom. Then I made a thoughtful face. “Has anyone seen him since his last shift?”

“I was just getting there.” Abby agreed. “Grandma said she saw Bill at work on Thursday, and he was acting really strange, like super jumpy and nervous… Then, no one sees him on Friday, and then Saturday? He turns up missing?” She raises an eyebrow expectantly, waiting for me to put together the pieces on my own.

“First Genie, then Bill…” I responded while I scratched my chin.

Then we all turned as Greg screamed down the hall toward us. “Hey! Get back to work!”

“On break!” Abby sneered at him. He tapped his finger on his watch. She turned back to me while Tom left the desk with a nervous look. He was very much the newer guy who would listen to the bosses every command. Whereas Abby had been there long enough that she didn’t care about what Greg told her, she got her work done and she knew he likely wouldn’t fire her or even reprimand her for slacking off for a few minutes. She turned back to me and nodded, “Just figured you’d like to know since you’ve been trying to figure out what happened to Genie…”

“Yeah, Thanks Abby…”

That’s all I have time to type out today, I have to get back to work, But I think I am going to look into it and see if I can track down any information on Genie or Bill. I have resources at work that could maybe help me.

I guess I will post again when and If I find out anything about them. In the meantime, I guess just stay tuned.
