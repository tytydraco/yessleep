If you haven’t read my first encounter with my theater, I suggest doing so [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ku7tl2/im_a_theater_usher_and_this_was_the_most/).



To recap: I work as an usher at a movie theater, and I once had a chilling encounter with a ghost in Theater 12. No one believed me then, and honestly, I was starting to convince myself it was just my imagination. But then something happened the other day—something even stranger. This time, it wasn’t in Theater 12. It was in the projector room.



It all started when my General Manager was packing up boxes of wires to send to another theater in our company. He asked me to head up to the projector room and grab a few more boxes. Normally, he would’ve helped, but he said he needed to wait for the District Manager to arrive. Being the dutiful employee—and having no real choice—I agreed and made my way upstairs to the booth.



The projector room, or "booth" as we call it, always gives me the creeps. Not because of ghosts, mind you, but because of how eerie it feels. It's basically a long, dimly lit hallway with only the beams of light from the projectors piercing through the gloom. To make things worse, we tend to use the booth as a makeshift storage area, so it’s cluttered with random junk.



As I wandered through the narrow space, trying to find the boxes, I realized just how dim it was. The flickering light barely illuminated anything, and the clutter made navigating even harder. Frustration started to creep in as I searched and searched with no luck.



Then I heard a voice.



“Need help finding something?”



Startled, I turned around and saw an older man standing there. He had graying hair and was wearing an old-fashioned uniform—a white button-up shirt, a maroon vest, and a black bow tie. It was so outdated that I vaguely remembered seeing pictures of employees in similar outfits from before I was even hired.



Assuming he was someone important—maybe the District Manager—I tried to hide my surprise.



“I’m looking for some boxes of wires for the TVs,” I said.



The man smiled and pulled out a flashlight. “I can help with that. I used to be a manager here years ago,” he said. “I know this booth like the back of my hand. My name’s David Perth, by the way.”



His confidence put me at ease, and I followed him as he navigated the cluttered space with ease. He led me to a wire rack buried under a pile of holiday decorations. With a practiced hand, he moved the decorations aside and pulled out the boxes I needed.



“Here you go,” he said, handing them over.



“Thanks Dave,” I replied, relieved. I made my way back downstairs to the lobby, carrying the boxes.



When I got there, my boss was chatting with a younger man who was just getting into his car.



“Who was that?” I asked.



“The DM,” my boss replied. “He stopped by to tell me about a company meeting next month.”



I froze. “Wait... that was the District Manager?”



“Yeah,” he said, giving me a curious look.



I hesitated, then asked, “Do you know anyone named David Perth?”



His expression shifted to one of confusion. “David Perth? Yeah, Dave was the old Assistant Manager here.”



“Does he still work for the company?”



My boss shook his head, his expression turning somber. “No, Dave passed away about ten years ago. Heart attack. It happened up in booth.”



I felt the blood drain from my face. My hands grew clammy as I stared at my boss in disbelief.



“You okay?” he asked, concern creeping into his voice.



I nodded stiffly, though my mind was racing. If no one believed me about the ghost in Theater 12, how could I possibly explain this?



As I glanced up at the ceiling, I felt a chill crawl down my spine. David Perth. The man who had helped me just moments ago. A man who wasn’t supposed to exist anymore.



No one believed me the first time. Why would they believe me now?
