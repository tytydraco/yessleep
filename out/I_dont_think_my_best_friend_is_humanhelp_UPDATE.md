Well, I messed up. You guys tore me up in the comment section, and I realized how wrong it was of me to snoop around. So today, I texted him that we need to talk. I called him and he answered, asking if I was okay and asking why I hadn’t been to school in a while. I didn’t say anything and sent the link to the post I had made about him, and I waited for him to say something. But I didn’t hear anything except the faint sound of crying. 

“Are you okay?” I questioned. “Listen, I know I messed up and I’m sorry, I really didn’t mean to—“

“I should’ve just told you… I knew something was up when you just left suddenly after I came back. Well yeah…you caught me. I don’t want you to be scared of me,” He continued, his voice cracking.

 “My parents, they aren’t from this planet, and when I was 7, they decided that they wanted me to have a normal life on Earth. So they made a deal with the leader of their planet, that I would be able to live the perfect life with a consequence: I’d have to take off my skin and wash it every day, and make sure it was perfect. If I didn’t do this, my skin would end up rotting and it wouldn’t be a nice sight… the last thing I remember is my parents telling me to live my best life. Then I woke up, and I was suddenly just in my house. I had to teach myself English and somehow I was able to enroll myself in our school when I was old enough. I can’t exactly answer any questions you have because honestly, I’m confused about myself too. Knowing that I’m just this monster hiding in a perfect body fucking hurts.”

I was shocked. I don’t even know how he was able to survive. And I also felt horribly guilty for what I did. 

“So you’re telling me… you’ve just been living on Earth, without your parents? How does that work?” I questioned. 

“I told you, I can’t really answer any questions because I don’t even know myself that well.”

“Right…sorry. And I’m sorry for everything I’ve done. I accept you for who you are and I’m not gonna unfriend you because of this. To be honest, I find it pretty cool. I find you perfect in my eyes.”

“Thanks. That made me feel better, finally telling you my secret,” he said and sighed in relief. “I’ll call you back later, bye!”

He ended the call and I was still quite confused, but I was happy he was able to tell me about himself. But the fact that he felt so insecure about himself made me feel so disgusting for the way I described him. So thank you, guys, for humbling me in the comment section. I’m going back to school tomorrow and the first thing I’m going to do is give him a big hug.
