The engine gave one final, choking sputter before the boat knocked against the decrepit dock. Now it was just a matter of getting my bags to the house. Rico had always been the working hub of the island, first to greet arrivals, and last to send them off. Though I suppose that might’ve changed now that the local ferry had cancelled service here, rerouting instead to the more developed islands nearby.

A shame, really. I still carry vivid memories of arriving by ferry in the summer months. Transit used to be an entire sunny day of anticipation. Wake early for the two-hour drive to Bristol. Devour Boston cream donuts while Mom and Dad sipped coffee. Browse the comic book shop and pick out one, just one, issue of *Omni Magazine* while we waited for the ferry’s horn to summon us. Then two hours on the sea, watching the minuscule island swell into shape, counting the cottages east of the old McAllister place until ours finally revealed itself on the shoreline.

There were only twelve cabins on Watchman’s Island. None of them had electricity, at least not when I was a kid. Maybe they’ve since installed solar panels, maybe even Starlink. I really hope not. The island’s charm lay in its simplicity, in the hush of a place, untouched. Nights softened by crickets and the hiss of gas-powered Coleman lanterns cooling against the dark.

It’s been over thirteen years since my last visit. I truly hope it’s all still the same. If so, it should start with Rico. He should’ve heard the boat come in, should be on his way to the dock now in the island’s lone vehicle. That old pickup of his had hauled generations of families and their belongings from boathouse to cottage. It was tradition. It was how things were done.

Rico was a man out of time. A man of indistinguishable background  (also a man very likely to be just recently out of the bottle).  He had the kind of dark complexion that led people to guess he was of Italian or possibly Greek descent. But really, his color was more like that of a roofer left baking in the sun for thirty years, sustained daily on Wild Turkey. There was always half an inch of grey stubble across his weathered chin, always a bit of a swagger, and often a stagger, to his gait. And always the same murmured drawl, recycled from years of repeated conversations echoing through the island’s silence. I’d never thought to ask where he wintered. Surely he didn’t stay here.

Rico was in the boathouse, stalwart against the flow of time. He lay curled in the corner where the earthen wall met the floor, perfectly at ease on a bed of bat and owl guano. Blissfully asleep in the last patch of shade lingering inside the sun-beaten, crumbling structure.

It took some effort to wake him, at least enough to get a response. But the moment his eyes cracked open, there was recognition, however muddled, waiting there.

"Farnworth," he mumbled, rising slowly. He stretched, then began shambling his rail-thin frame toward the dirt path.

I’m not entirely sure he recognized *me*, exactly; more likely, he identified my lineage. I had inherited my father’s curly black hair and my grandfather’s solid build. Rico had known them both, at least for a few weeks each summer.

The man’s presence spoke of age, of old, untreated injuries, and a life lived hard and alone. He was the very image of a New England “Swamp Yankee” in its purest form. But his right leg told a different story, something darker, something I couldn’t quite place. It looked as if a potato-sized chunk of his calf was simply gone. Not cut away, but taken. The surrounding flesh was rotting. There’s no better word for it. A dark, wet mess of weeping tissue, threaded with something fungal, something that reeked.

Yes, I suggested he see a doctor. More than once. But all he offered in return were slurred and twisted variations of, “Good now, sorted it...” Rico had been slipping even twenty years ago, but the decline since then was unmistakable.

We got into his 1960s farm truck, more rust than metal, and started our short journey.  Rico wasn’t much for conversation, so I just listened to branches scraping along the sides and let myself drift into old memories. I also tapped my front pocket, as I had done every time I transitioned from one form of transport to another that day, just waiting for my casually clandestine meetup. Still there. Still got them.

As expected, the path was almost completely overgrown, forcing us off the road more than once. Each time, branches tore at my arms through the side of the cab. The truck hadn’t had windows for as long as I could remember. Welts rose where the branches struck, and the sting brought on a wave of nausea. I nearly lost my stomach when Rico slammed the brakes and we both lurched forward like synchronized headbangers.

There was a hole in the middle of the road. As wide as a man. A year ago, when I still had a 36-inch waist, I might’ve been able to crawl into it myself. Must be a sinkhole, I thought. But it wasn’t just deep, it extended off to the side. More like a badger den, except this was far too big.

"Quarter?" Rico held out his wiry, vein-laced hand, and I just stared at it. "Quarter. Got one?"

I fished around in my pocket and handed one over, mumbling, “Of course,” unsure why he was asking. He took the coin, creaked the door open, stepped out, and flicked it into the hole. I twisted in my seat to watch him as he pulled two weathered wooden slats from the bed of the rusty beast and dragged them over the opening. Then he climbed back in and eased the truck forward, rolling us across the makeshift bridge.

"What was that about?" I asked before I realized that I did not really expect, or perhaps even want, an answer.

"Island's been troubled. Holes opening. Overrun by the wilds.  People stopped coming when the Ferry stopped, and things went backward. I s'pose to where they were before people. Before we came with machines, an order, an cellu*lar* phones, and the like. Lucky I remember the old ways. Gran' Ernestice taught me the ways as a tike. How to offer'up, How to draw ya lines. Make ya space. Good for it, too. Kept me."

"I see," I replied meekly. I did not see. But encouragement would likely just encourage continued incoherent mutterings.

The remaining ten-minute ride passed in silence. We pulled up in front of the cabin, Rico swinging the truck around beside the old well pump.

Now came the toll. I’m a wealthier man than my father ever was, and a good deal more generous. I paid Rico well: two fifths of mid-shelf whiskey. Handing him a top-shelf scotch would’ve been like pouring it straight into that hole we crossed earlier. Still, I had one more bottle tucked away for the return trip.

He accepted the offering like a seventeen-year-old, half-blind, limping dog eyeing a slab of meat dropped on the floor. He lingered outside until I’d unlocked the front door, then turned and shuffled off, either to his own ramshackle cabin, or back to the dock to wait for a ferry that hadn’t come in years.

It takes all types, I thought.

\+ + +

Inhale. That deep, musky smell of mildew and charred firewood from a long-forgotten burn. Creosil and bug spray. The sweet, sour stink of mouldering books. A scent like memory turned to rot.

The state of the cabin was worse than expected. Unhindered wood rot. Sagging floors covered with carpets, which were quite moist with something closer to fish oil than sea water.  The rising smell from the threadbare carpet was the worst of it, though. Nearly unidentifiable in its soupy assault upon the senses. It clung to the nostrils, sweet and meaty like spoiled broth, unplaceable, but intimately wrong.

It also appeared that some clever creature had gained full access.  In the corner of the common room, to the left of the woodstove, was a nested hole. Surrounded by bits of dried woven grass and straw, its opening perhaps only two inches across. My first thought was rats, but I'd never known of a rat nesting quite like that. Groundhog? Gopher? Squirrels?  I'm not sure I had ever seen any on the Isle before, though my pre-teen attentions were unhindered by documenting the local fauna.

I withdrew the satchel from my pocket and placed it beside my bed, safe and sound. Its contents hidden away, swathed in black velvet, until I could meet the dodgy buyer in Bristol next week. 

I started on cleaning up the bedroom so that I could sleep comfortably and not awaken struggling to breathe through the allergens accumulating over the years past. Then I set my sights on closing that little entryway in the corner.  Nocturnal visitors would find their welcome revoked this evening. 

Three teeth. Three of them. I found them when pulling apart the wreath-shaped burrow in the corner. Each tooth was buried deeper in the assemblage than could be seen at first glance, and scattered evenly around the hole. They were too big to be rat teeth. They were also too rectangular.  They resembled human teeth but were clearly too small and strangely shaped. Smooth and clean. As if they had been waiting for me. Presented.

I put aside speculation on that point and finished the job, just in time for tea at sundown.  I enjoyed both on the front porch and pondered whether or not I would wait here for the stars as I listened to the sound of the sea retreating and returning, over and over, with varied effort but constant music.

That was when I first saw him. The boy.  Just for a second. He was peering through the bushes to the west of the clearing with a big smile on his face. Two things struck me about him. Well, perhaps three. The shirt he wore was familiar, not the shirt itself, but the style. It was one of those 1970s muted, striped shirts. With a dark collar and sleeves. Secondly, and more starkly, I noticed that his smile was lacking. Not only lacking in mirth, but also lacking three teeth. Evenly spaced gaps in his twisted mouth.

The third thing I noticed, I'm not sure how to express. An overall feeling of distance. Almost like this boy did not quite fit here, in this place, not comfortably. Like his very existence was the result of much effort. As though the world was holding its breath just to allow him space to appear.  Yesterday, I would have thought I was mad, but I've recently learned that trust, in your strange impressions, may just save your life.

The boy leaned over, picked up a wooden crate, and was gone in a flash. No branches swayed. No leaves were disturbed. And no sound was made. He was just gone. I knew it was worthless to try to follow or find him. In fact, I wanted nothing more than to simply forget what I had seen.  But I was not able to convince myself that it was a hallucination.

Instead, I lit the little gas lantern and ran my finger down the spines across the bookshelf, tilting my head and reading snippets of titles. "Strange Land", "Man, Myth", " of The Rose", "Mountains of", "Mailman", all familiar. All striking a note not quite right for my mood. These were titles waiting for another reader.

Then I touched upon a plain black spine, which turned out to be a thin journal. One I did not recognize but seemed rather old, given the penmanship. It was neither dated nor signed and only contained a single attempt at a poem. Maybe more of a limerick.

>"Johnny Jackrabbit crossed the way,

>Johnny JackRabbit had no say,

>The machines crushed him,

>The boy carried him,

>Then Johnny started to play."

Ok, well…. That was another book off the reading list…. 

I cursed myself when I opened my phone out of boredom and indecision, and decided a nightcap and a good solid sleep would be just the thing to settle. It turns out I would be allowed to enjoy neither.

Halfway through finishing the pour on a tumbler of rather nice cognac, I heard the scratching.  Construction had already begun on a new bypass through the rags and wood glue I had plugged the varmint entrance hole with. My makeshift bastion was completed not just thirty minutes ago, but life could be pervasive in the strange lands outside the cities.

I knocked the broom handle against the walls around the entrance, first tentatively and then vigorously as necessity required. Resulting in no change in the veracity of the intruder. I ran out the front door to the back corner of the house to try to locate the creature. Unsuccessful, I beat the broom handle around the propane tank loudly and soaked in the resulting silence, before returning to the kitchen, victorious. 

Then it began again.

Fine. If the furred fiend was going to be that avuncular, perhaps we should meet face-to-face. I lowered myself first to my knees, and then flat on my belly. Eye level now, I watched the cloth twitch and quiver as the ravenous gnawing continued. At this point, I was beyond being curious about what genus of rodent had been living in my inherited vacation home. Instead, I smiled, imagining how it would react to coming through and finding itself face to face with a pink-skinned monster ten times its size, staring it directly in the eyes.

My makeshift plug trembled and was soon partially pulled away. And there it was, that little black nose just starting to poke through the newly cleared passageway. A mole? Its work continued, and the crevice widened. Through the growing opening, the animal's face twisted back and forth, tugging and gnawing. A green eye flashed for a second as it tore another strip away. The teeth. They looked like little ladders.  A Badger? A Skunk? I could not recall seeing teeth like that in any guidebook or nature documentary. 

My questioning and theorizing stopped, and reaction took control as three long skeletal legs crowded their way through the opening alongside the peeking face. Dark, black, and insectoid appendages worked alongside the body of the furry, gnashing, green-eyed… something.

As I said, reaction had superseded rational thinking. I was up and throwing my drink at the creature, as best I could, through the opening. And immediately launched one of my Coleman lanterns, the one currently lit, into flight. Fire did the work that I hoped the intimidation and astringent drink would have. A rueful yelp accompanied the vermin's exit, and I was left to quell the remaining flames. The scent of scorched fur lingered long after the creature had fled.

Before crawling into bed, I shook off the experience by lifting the little velvet bag on my bedside table and once again thought, "This is freedom." As always, my finger dwelt over the knot of string, keeping it tightly closed. Five million, at least. This was independence. The race was over. I had won. I do have that.

I found the lingering smell of burning to be strangely pleasant as I lay my head upon the pillow and tried to reach those elysian fields of slumber. But sleep was not to come. Only a parade of mosquito bites, rodent migrations, unidentifiable house noises, and other strange cries from the wood out back. Along with a growing unease about the next few days before my meeting. I was not alone in this place.

\+ + +

The following day seemed to come to an end just after sunrise. I could list the things that I had accomplished. I could account for each estimated hour in retrospect. I could accept that perhaps I had sat by the water for three hours, not one. But then the light was simply… gone. The sky darkened without warning, and a cold gale surged in from across the ocean like a pungent breath, rich and knowing.

The wind brought other things as well. Or perhaps the boy had instead arrived upon the spreading darkness, rather than the change in atmospheric conditions. Regardless, I saw him again. Plain as day. At the very edge of the Brentworth property, carrying that same wooden box down the beaten path leading back to the boathouse. 

This time, I set aside my discomfort and resolved to approach the experience in a more rational way. Slipping into my jacket, I began to quietly trail him. Trying to get the boy's attention or attempting to call out to him would have been even more rational. But I could not ignore the voice that told me it also would have been fruitless. And perhaps worse than that. Instead, I obeyed this internal directive and simply followed.

I watched his small frame sway and stumble (albeit without noise, or disturbance to the stones at his feet, or the flora he brushed along the way). He drifted, not walked, skimming the ground like a marionette on slack strings, shimmering at the edges of perception as twilight retreated. I managed to keep pace, though, and eventually found myself with further company.

The boy stopped and knelt at the hole in the road that I had crossed just the day before. I'm not sure if he was aware of joining another visitor who had preceded his arrival. Rico was bent over the opposing edge of the pit, also on his knees, pouring the whiskey I had given him into that impossible hollow like it was a libation to some silent, watching thing\*\*.\*\* The boy followed. He leaned over, pulled a long, grey, and quite dead hare from the box, and lowered it into the hole, sobbing silently.

Without warning, I found myself on my knees as well, as the world turned and the earth twisted beneath my poorly rooted feet. It felt like what any New Englander thinks an earthquake \*would\* feel like. Although it was accompanied by a guttural cacophony and a stench reminiscent of wet copper and turned fish.

Rico must have departed before I regained my balance. Neither he or the wandering phantom remained. It was just me and the hole, here beneath the peering stars. 

This was not my first dark hole. Twelve years ago, I stared down another abyss. A cancer scare, what most would consider a midlife crisis, a bloodthirsty divorce, a home foreclosure, and more (wait, there's more!). I had fought my way through with action and perseverance. Leading eventually to the little satchel containing three quite rare pink diamonds I carried with me now after their long journey from China, through Jordan and then Antwerp in payment for my hard work. Though I suppose the work itself was not recognized by the purchaser. Only the plethora of sensitive data transmitted in the opposing direction.  Regardless, I managed to recover and eventually completely reverse my financial situation by taking action, digging in, and fighting. So I decided once again on this proven method. Just to **do** something about it.

I trucked back to the cabin grounds, grabbed a shovel out of the shed beside the outhouse, and returned to fill it. It took more than an hour, leaving me dusty and sweaty, but I headed back more than a little drunk on pride.

That was the last thing I clearly remember before regaining consciousness to find myself half buried and being devoured. Tearing at my skin, my mind. Taking me apart piece by piece. 

\+ + +

I now understand what had happened. Arriving home in the dark, I slipped on an accumulation of sand covering the steps of the porch. I must have rung my bell of the clothesline post on my way down, sending me into an unintended slumber. When I awakened, it was like surfacing through anesthesia. Gasping, thick-headed, and not entirely certain I had returned to the same world I left.

Confusion could not, however, explain why I was half-buried in sand and soil. Nor did it explain why the remaining exposed parts of my body were being pinched and pulled at.

I clawed out of my shallow grave to scare the creatures off. They were shelled like beetles but with mangey, furry faces and rat-like teeth. The critters had managed to take two pebble-sized chunks from my flesh before finally retreating into the underbrush. And I could already see angry red and matching blue-grey tendrils beginning to crawl up the veins on my belly and shoulder. A fifteen-year Scotch was all I had to treat the wounds. Such a waste.

At some point while dabbing myself with an alcohol doused rag, I began to consider my situation. The sands I had awoken beneath very much resembled the earth I had displaced the previous night. There was no questioning that. My more analytical voice countered and pointed out that most of the soil on the island was quite the same.

Tired from the lack of sleep and woozy from the injury, I still managed to soldier myself out to the hole. And confirm that yes, it was now cleared of my fill, and gaping once again.  That was when I decided I’d had enough. I would return to my condominium in Boston, stop at an urgent care center, and soak my disbelief away on my heated floors and in my steaming jacuzzi.

I was out the door in no time. Having no way to contact Rico (the man had never in his life had a working telephone), I hauled my bags up the path to the boathouse, careful to step widely around the dark pit. The way that things were unraveling for me, it will come as no shock that this plan for escape was bound to loosen and uncoil around my feet as well.

Pull after pull, the outboard motor would not start. I checked the electrical connections, spun the propeller to ensure it was not seized, and opened the gas cap to check the fuel level. I found it completely full. Full of sand.

"Got to be fucking kidding me…" under my breath.

I looked around, finding no other vessel docked, no other hope of salvation. I had no mobile reception. My transport was irreparably damaged, just as my cabin had been compromised; I was exhausted, and I was growing increasingly nervous about my position.

Rico was my only option. He might know if someone is scheduled to arrive in the coming days. He may have a boat of his own, moored elsewhere, out of sight. So I returned my things to mine and made the trek to his cottage.

Rico's place sported the classic front yard of any good old American hoarder. A washing machine frame here, an antique armoire slowly dying under the rain and sun there. As children, we used to joke that anything you lost on the island, a coin, a button, even your own excrement, would eventually turn up in Rico’s front yard.

Things had changed, though. Rather than spare parts and furniture, the man's frontage was now surrounded by piles of components organized into what looked like modern artistic sculptures. He did not strike me as the type for a gallery showing, sharing cheese and wine with financial directors and other Los Angeles hoi polloi. But frankly, the structures were strangely compelling. There were perhaps six "sentries" in an arc around the front of this cabin. Peeking around back, I found the same pattern mirrored by another set.

Luckily, Rico was home and opened the door wide. Though he got quite annoyed and cursed to himself when my entry spread a pile of salt into the room from the threshold, which he immediately swept back across the threshold with his hands, muttering something too softly to catch.

"You comeabout 'er then." He shot at me as we sat and cracked open two Pabst Blue Ribbons.

"Her? No, I…"

"'Er children?"

I sat for a moment in dumb confusion, and he nodded to himself. "My boat. There's sand in the tank and the motor is busted."

"Yahuh?"

"Do you know if anyone is due to arrive soon? Any idea how I could get back to the port?" I didn't want to ask him directly, but my hope was that he would be able to run me back.

Rico looked over his shoulder. "Selma's not run for two seasons now." I assumed he meant his little oceaner. "Mmmm… Thompsons don't come no more. Warnocks not been here since the ferry stopped. The only…. nah… not after last year. Ah Reggie. Reggie'll come Tuesday. Don't mind riding with the plastics, he'll take yah back."

Tuesday. Three more nights. The first two had gone rather badly, and I did not think that things would improve any time soon. If I were really stuck here, I should probably stop interfering with whatever the hell was happening on this island. Stay away from that gaping hole. Maybe if I just stayed quiet. Remained inside. Stopped messing with things, I could… you know… blend. Rico did. Apparently.

"S'rong with the motor? Ya said." He continued to look at his beer.

"Sand."

He scoffed. "Tried to fill tha' hole"

"Yes. Yes, I tried to fill it in and then…" Jesus, he knew what was happening here. "Then there was sand at my cottage, and in my boat. I… I can't explain it. What's happening here?" I scratched at the bandage on my arm and noticed the man's eyes twitch towards it and frown.

"Always gotta fix things. Improve, that's the word. All of 'em. All ya. Like there's a proper way an' ya wanna make the whole world right. Your way.  Sometime there ain't no winning battle, know what I mean. Sometimes life digs a hole that canna be filled.  The problem is, ya think it can."

I remained quiet, trying to follow.

"It's like here. They buy tha' summer homes, move in. Leave trash, live trash lives. Don't spect it changes things. Don't 'spect it's outta their control. An' one day… the hole shows itself. Built up over time. Gettin' deeper wit each lie. Each abuse. Every piece'a dirt and trash. Soon it's deep'nough for *her*. Soon *she* comes and makes things *her way.*"

"I…"

"You. Yeah, you. Ya' got three more days. Y'already bitten. Already got 'er attention. Best find something to give 'er. Or get gone, if ya'can."

"Give? Like what?"

"Like summa ya don't wanna give a'course. S'wat we all like best. Summa undeserved. Stolen. Somethin' hard to part with. It's why she came, after all."

Silence made space for itself then. Right about the time that my eyes settled on a small picture frame surrounded by dusty shells on the shelf behind Rico. A ten-year-old boy, missing a tooth but smiling energetically at the camera. The same boy I had seen for fleeting moments over the past few nights.

"Yours?" I gestured to the photo.

His eyes welled up immediately. "Was, yeah. Good heart. Good, good boy. Too good for this wicked world. Too good to learn the old ways… never shoulda taught him."

At my lack of response, Rico told me the story of his son.

The boy's mother, Rico's wife, had died when he was just 2 years old (I had never known Rico was married. He was always so… singular). In the parental wisdom of the 80's 

The obvious application for a wound like that was something small and furry. 

For little Sam, that was Johnny. Not just a white rabbit with crimson eyes, but an actual hare, carrying that wild blood that lengthened their frames and led to disproportionately large paws and pads. The boy took Johnny everywhere. They ate together, slept together, and at one point, little Sam actually set up a litter pan in the john so they could do their dirty, side by side, when nature called.

At the time, life on the island was thriving. Large families were coming in weekly to summer, and newly adult children were taking a split of land from their families to build cottages of their own, for their new wives and in some cases children. And where there is a market, the locusts come.

Santorini development and construction rolled their diggers, drills, and trucks right into the newfound goldmine. And in so doing, rolled a cement truck right over Johnny Rabbit on the way to yet another planned building site. Rico cried when he described the state of his boy at the time. "Such a soft heart. Such a loving boy." over and over again.  The pain in Rico's voice makes it clear that it pulls at the man to this day.

So Rico did what any father would. He took action. In this case, that meant teaching Sam what he called “the old way.” In essence, I took Rico's vague insinuations to mean that he taught his son how to bring Johnny back. To reunite them. With some obscure old local ritual.  Rico was sure to tell me that he had never attempted it himself, but the knowledge was passed to him from his Grandmother (a strange and ill-tempered woman by the sound of things).

The moon was full when Sam placed the remains of Johnny into a wooden box and headed out into the night.  He returned screaming that Johnny had "run widdershins and then into the wood".  Rico had some trouble understanding the boy due to the new gap between his teeth, and the blood building in his mouth and throat. 

The tooth was right. There had to be an offering, Rico explained. And that particular tooth was due for an escape soon anyhow. What Rico hadn’t realized was how generous and how desperate his son really was. That the boy would pay any price necessary for Johnny to return.

Rico tried to have a conversation with the boy when he returned the next night with another missing tooth. And on the third, they fought something terrible, and the boy's arm had been dislocated when the argument became physical. Rico wept openly at this point in the retelling.  And I understand why. It was the last time he saw his progeny. After his own violent transgression. Sam had crawled out of his window that evening, never to be seen again.

"But she's still 'ere. The *thing* ma boy fed and nurtured. Tha' thing he loved.  But that love is gone, and she feels it. Everaday. With a hunger can't be splained. And *you* just defiled her home." 

\+ + +

Did I want to return to my cabin, alone, ten minutes from nightfall? No, I did not. Was I going to beg Rico for a sleepover, like a five-year-old, and ask him to make me dinner? Certainly not. When the conversation waned and the quiet took hold, I made my exit, thanking him for his time and company.

I walked very slowly, in no rush at all, to my cabin and spent a few hours securing the doors and windows. I doused the burrow in the corner with the most noxious chemical sprays I could locate, and then kept watch through sunset on the front porch.  As the darkness spread, I began to hear the sounds pick up on the wind.

A distant deep drumbeat for one, two, three strikes, then silence. Scuttling in the bushes to the left and behind the house. A cry echoed in the trees, part anguish, part ecstasy, entirely unplaceable. Life. Fully present and abundant here. undeterred by pavement. Unfazed by cars and frantic human activity. This was held to be beautiful by many. From what I've seen and read in the poetic waxing of outdoorsmen.  For me, it was just fodder for growing anxiety.

How could I possibly do two more nights of this? The question was moot. The island had already decided for me.

Dreams came before true sleep did.  Flashes of images past and present. The night I spent sleeping off far too many drinks in a rowhome doorway, penniless and just as aimless. The last few heated arguments with Pauline, before the divorce. Screaming every insult I could at the poor woman as she tugged at her hair. The pain of frantic nips at my skin just this morning. Flashes of the boy, Sam, kneeling before the yawning Abyss, offering devotion to something far older than I could comprehend.

The abysmal menagerie of memory was broken by yet another intrusion, and I was on my feet. My eyes adjusted to the almost pitch black. I ran out into the kitchen, trailing after the scrabbling sounds. What I could only assume were the rodents, once again working their way through my barrier. Then I realized that the sound was coming from several locations at once. 

There must have been ten or more of them, scritching, scratching, tearing, and pulling with those needle teeth at the crumbling bastion of my inherited summer home. From every corner. My mind reverted to some Cro-Magnon place, and the solution it offered was singular. Fire. When the boma is under threat, fire is the last refuge of the frightened primate.

I grabbed the largest candle I had brought and lit it in a rush, the flame trembling in the dark. Then, with a grin, I upped the ante, raising a can of Raid bug spray behind it. Makeshift blowtorch in hand, I took to defending the encampment. Whiskers were singed. The receding, squealing gave me a sense of satisfaction as I turned from the corner to other areas of encroachment.

Running to the bathroom, I drenched the spaces between the pipes and the wall with flames and listened as the scrambling sounds spread lower and lower behind the walls.  Rattling windows were treated similarly, and attempts to squeeze between the window frames ceased. One after another. Each trespass was quelled by the open flame. I continued in a frenzy, running from room to room in the darkness, avoiding obstructions and raining fire on my aggressors until the house began to accumulate more smoke than my lungs could comfortably manage.

I looked over my shoulder while fleeing and noticed the obstruction outside the kitchen window. It was barely discernible in the darkness. If not for the fact that the moonlight was reflecting off the silver-coated tank behind the house. I saw an enormous brush of flesh and fur against the window pane before pushing straight through, shattering the glass and splintering the frame. A paw. The pad of an animal's foot. Muddy tendrils of fur and chipped, jagged claws were now probing across the countertop, struggling for purchase.

A Hare. It was a rabbit's paw that was clawing and searching for my pink flesh. Only the paw was the size of my head.  And now it was tearing planks and siding from the exterior and interior wall of the kitchen. The creature had gained a foothold that I could certainly not repel with my makeshift weapon. 

Let him come, I would exit out front, under the sky. Somewhere with options. On my flight from the kitchen, I took note of the now brightly lit bathroom. Lit in orange and crimson. My mind whirled as I beelined for the door and finally accepted the reality of what I had seen. 

Red coals. Smoldering and smoking. Five feet up the wall, threatening to burst at any moment. My little blowtorch had been more effective than I thought, too well in fact, and had set the crawlspace between the rooms alight.

No matter, escape was the plan. Returning to the confinement of the cottage was no longer an option, regardless of the fire damage. Before reaching the door, I ducked into the bedroom to salvage only what I needed. I didn't even consider my luggage or cell phone, just the necessities. There was only one. I snatched the satchel of precious stones from my bedside table and was circling the house toward the path in seconds. 

For a moment, I had neglected to fully consider the gargantuan Hare out back, and began frantically looking left to right when I realized its absence. The truth of the matter is that it had intuited my plan, stopped tearing into the cabin to gain access, and had simply lain in wait, hidden in the brush for the most fortuitous moment to pounce.

I immediately found myself on my back, with a mouthful of moist and mildewy fur, fighting for my life. Curling to my left at the sharp pain of tearing skin, screaming, and all the while punching at random sinew and muscle, still clutching the velvet bag in my palm. 

The creature reared up to gain momentum for a descent that would certainly crush my skull against the stones, and I took the opportunity to free myself from its mildewy bulk. To rise up and face the monstrosity.

It's eyes. Oh god, there was darkness there. Complex and endless entanglements of insanity. A universe of grinding, building and chaotic pain. I wanted to be there. To live there. Like standing on a cliff and knowing that you could, no you *desire* to jump. 

I looked away and did my best to avoid the possibility of making contact with those dark orbs again.  Twisting my hips, I wrenched its hind leg from the earth and regained my ground. I ducked an incoming swipe, then lifted a sharp discus of slate that had fallen from the old roof.  Just before I was swallowed again by those bottomless eyes. Maddened, shifting, and singing lullabies of lunacy that gnawed at the edges of reality itself, I hurled the slate with all my spinning might. 

Without warning, I was lifting myself from the ground ten feet from the cabin, remarkably closer to my intended destination. Bleeding from the mouth, ears, arms, and god knows where else, I blocked my ears to stop the incessant ringing. The slate tile I had hurled had missed its target. Sailing past the devouring spirit, it had instead struck and breached the propane tank. Which had been just outside the flames licking up the kitchen wall.  Boom. I don’t remember the blast itself, only the sudden relocation, the pain, the ringing.

It mattered not. I fled, my escape route now within reach. The boathouse, while not more defensible than my cabin, was the bastion of the island. The central touchstone during periods of coming and going. And I was doing my best to go. It was also the most likely place to find Rico once the sun rose. And hell, if necessary, I could jump from the dock and tread water for as long as required. Could hares swim? I prayed not.

Just before my lungs gave out, I was stopped dead in my tracks by the scene developing on the path before me. The boy, Sam. He was squatting in the middle of the way. Crouched over and twitching as if he were frantically playing a flute.  I slowly approached to see that, no, in fact, he was rooting around in his own mouth with a pair of pliers. Spelunking with that cold metal for another tooth, I suppose. Another offering. Even as tears grow at the corners of his eyes. Giving everything he can for the return of his childhood pet. And instead, unwittingly birthing the monstrosity that now stalked the island.

The monster that was, at this very moment, casually approaching the opposite side of the abyss in the road, having managed to pass me through the wood. Shining the yellow light of his eyes upon the child's morbid offering, and then at me.

Cold and ruthless clarity struck me then. A knowing beyond reason. The limitations of choice. The leveraging of loss.  How one thing could cost another. My life as a whole melted down into a coin and weighed against the suffering of existence. The coin. The offering. It was the price of passage. If I could pay. If I wanted to survive.

The black velvet bag rose before me, reaching eye level like a cosmic jellyfish, darker than the waters in which it swam. My head swam, and I was almost entirely disconnected from my body. I watched those fingers pull at the knots, and turn the bag over, as one, two, three. Three pink diamonds flashed in the starlight before sinking into the nothingness at my feet.  Sam dove in after them first. The beast followed just a moment thereafter. I was left behind. In darkness. In silence. And for the first time in days, at peace.

It's not so bad. The shower gets cold in under three minutes, and the kitchen faucet leaks more and more each time the repairman leaves. Still, I can live with it.

I even met someone important to me, for the first time in years. And I actually expect it to last. I never told her this story, of course. She has such a pure heart, and I'd rather not put this particular spot of cyclopean darkness upon her lovely shoulders. I met her on a trip to the park, with a four-year-old named Sam, strangely enough. Sam had lost both of his parents, not just one, unlike the island's Sam.

I had joined the Big Brother program just a month after my escape from the island. I also volunteered at a soup kitchen. It wasn't a very lucrative way to spend my time, but somehow the horrors I’d lived through on that island served only to sharpen my awareness of the quieter horrors around us. The ones continually unfolding in plain sight.

Sam is currently my crowning achievement in that regard. I was making a real difference to him; I could see that every day. Every time he opens up a little more, every time he lets me glimpse what he’s been through. Every time he smiles, not because he’s trying to please, but because he knows I see him. That he’s not alone.

I only wish that I could bear to take him to the zoo without breaking out in sweat at each whiff of wet fur. And that I had enough money to treat him to lunch. 

And I do so worry that the old, half-blind cat that curls up with him in bed at the care home might not make it past the next [winter](https://dmblackwell.com).
