I'm not sure if this is happening outside my county (Adams, OH), or if I am hallucinating because I haven't heard anything from anyone regarding the latest EAS announcement that went off on my TV just this morning.  The alert read simply:

"THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS."

Only on my TV; no other devices have been affected, most likely because the satellite for my TV  and my landline are the only things I have that have any connection at all to the government. I've been an engineer for 5 years now, off-grid for 3, but I couldn't figure those out by myself. 

I'm sorry if this story doesn't come out right. Lord knows I've never been an author. 

Anyway, I figured there must be some sort of glitch in the system or a hacker. So I called my mom. She doesn't do well with situations like this (if there's any other situation that can be compared to this one), so I wanted to check in on her, or even just to calm myself down in the process. But it was down. Even after covering my ears to listen closely after re-dialing, because the EAS alarms were still going off, it was just a dial tone.

At some point, enough was enough. That noise is just so grating, and it was designed to cause panic. But my TV wouldn't turn off. Even after I smacked the remote on the table and pressed the button on it manually. All I was faced with was loud, blaring, screeches and, "THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS."

So I try calling the police, but naturally, the landline wasn't working at all. Even though I called my mom just last night and it was working fine. There's still some hope that maybe this county is just run by fools who don't know how technology works. It was a feasible explanation; it's a small county. We probably don't have access to all that fancy federal stuff. But even that wouldn't explain why nobody else is here.

Because after I gave up calling the police, I got my gun and went out. Figured I would help some people, cause worse case scenario, this could be some sort of terrorist situation. But it's beyond. I don't know if terrorism is the right word for it. I don't want to say supernatural. I believe in science and technology and logic. I don't want it to be supernatural. But I don't know any other word for it.

Because everyone is gone. I went inside my nearest neighbors' houses (the crime rate here is too low for anybody to bother locking their doors), and it was all empty. Empty and orderly, too. No signs of struggle, no blood, no corpses, absolutely nothing.

My mom is gone, too, and all I found that was out of the ordinary was her landline phone dangling by its curly wire. No blood anywhere. Nothing else out of order, either, besides the phone.

No traffic, either, as I drove my way here to the public library. No librarians. I strolled right in. I searched for any other signs of humans before I went out to the car for extra rounds and locked the doors behind me. For whatever reason, whatever terrorist is here, was not entirely thorough with cutting us off. There is still wifi here. Probably assumed they had done a thorough sweep of the place, hopefully they don't know I'm here. I'm not fond of social medias like this. I know my grandson enjoys this website, and I know millions of others do, too. 

So I need to know that I'm not alone. I need to ask if anyone knows anything about this, maybe some government officials, maybe FBI, and if I can do anything at all. I will stay here at the library, and pray they don't find me here.
