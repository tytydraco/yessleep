“It is nice to finally meet you.”  

I leaned back in my chair. Usually, my potential clients are too eager or too nervous to go into the details immediately. Not this time.  

“How much does a person feel while they are in them?”  

“As much as you feel right now, Mr. Carter.”  

"John is fine."  

"Okay, Mr. Carter."  

“And cost?”  

“Non-negotiable.”  

I made little circles on the table with my index finger.  

“Now, this man. Give me his height, age, weight, and where he works.”  

"Thomas Doyle. I think he’s 6’2” maybe 6’3”?"  

“No, John, he’s way shorter than that.”  

“Well, what is he then? Where does he work? That bar?”  

“Yeah, the Duke or King or something.”  

I grimaced.  

“Listen to me. We provide the service. No problem here. But you specifically told me that you would provide me access to him. This isn’t our first rodeo, and due to your incompetence, it won’t be our last.”  

“Wait. Just wait a minute. You cannot speak to…”  

“I can. I can pull the plug on this any time I feel like it.”  

I inhaled. I was tired. Morally tired.  

I stretched out my hands as a sign of peace.  

“Listen. We can do this from start to finish. It will cost more, but you have our assurances that we will do this as professionally as we can. In saying that, we will need more from you than you’re willing to give me right now. This is where the rubber hits the road.”  

I pointed to the headset.  

“Put it on, Mr. Carter.”  

He stared at it blankly. I interrupted the silence.  

“Remember,” I said, “you’ll feel everything, but keep in mind that time moves differently here. One second outside equals fifteen minutes inside.”  

I handed him the headset. He put it on.  

The transparent visor buzzed and crackled. His eyes dilated rapidly, and his mouth opened and closed, miming words. I smiled at Mrs. Carter. She was speechless, looking on as her husband’s face played out a lifetime of experience in seconds.  

I kept an eye on the monitors, monitoring their vitals and reactions. After a few moments,  

“You think I am making a mistake?”  

“The only mistakes I care about, Ms. Carter, are the ones in that headset. If you want a morality lesson, talk to a priest or philosopher.”  

I actually did not know if she was making a mistake. I leaned over and removed the headset carefully. Mr. Carter jolted forward and inhaled with such severity he began coughing.  

“How long was I out?”  

“Only a few moments, but I am sure it felt like hours.”  

I let the silence exist while they stared into space.  

"I was on this beach. It was phenomenal. I tasted salt in the air. I felt the heat. I drank a cocktail. I actually did all that."  

“Do you want to say anything?” I asked gently.  

Mrs. Carter’s jaw clenched. “I just want him to understand what he did. To feel it.”  

Mr. Carter’s voice was hoarse. “Make him suffer.”  

I coughed and slid a briefing document across the table.  

>March 5th, 1998. Thomas Doyle was involved in a collision involving you, your wife, and your two daughters, Laurie and Lynda. His defense was that while he was at the bar where he worked, he did not imbibe alcohol and that the fault was on your reckless driving, Mr. Carter.  

I glanced up at the scorn on Mrs. Carter’s face. I considered my words carefully.  

“Would you like to try again?” I offered.  

“Maybe. What will his experience be?”  

They looked at each other and nodded in unison. I activated the headset once more.  

This time, I adjusted the parameters slightly, allowing them only five seconds of the experience.  

“Do you want to say anything?” I prompted again.  

Mrs. Carter’s voice trembled, “How bad will it be?”  

“Worse than what you’re thinking right now.”  

I rubbed my eyes, tired, slightly questioning my own sanity.  

“I just want him to suffer,” Mrs. Carter whispered.  

“The punishment you seek isn’t in the virtual. This device can prolong the pain, but it can’t bring your daughters back. It can’t truly make him suffer the way you are.”  

A silence fell between us.  

“Then what’s the point?” Mrs. Carter finally asked.  

“I don’t know. That isn’t part of my job, Ms. Carter.”  

I placed the headset on her head as it whirled and lit up in different flashing colors. After a moment, I took it off, and she fell to the floor screaming and gasping for air.  

“Jesus Christ, are you alright? Fuck, what happened? What was it?”  

“It... I was choking, but I’m alive?”  

I leaned back in my chair and presented her with the brief. We modeled it after an experience a cave diver had recently. It was in the news. The experience inside the cave would have been an increasingly suffocating nightmare, as darkness closed in around the trapped, helpless.  

Tight, claustrophobic passages would have squeezed the body, each movement met with resistance and despair. The silence would have been broken only by the faint, haunting echoes of muffled breaths and the distant, relentless drip of water. As oxygen dwindled, panic would have set in. In other words, you are in the dark. You cannot move. You cannot even flinch.  You're stuck. Forever. This will be Thomas Doyle's future if you choose this.  

She began crying.  

Mr. Carter shuffled with unease. 

"Maybe, maybe we should think this through more?"

Mrs. Carter lifted her head. Tears streaming down his face.

“I am so sorry, John.”  

With a puzzled look, he was jolted out of his seat. Two men grabbed him from behind, shoving him into a plain, white room. I could hear his muffled screams momentarily and then just the whirl of the headset. Mr. Carter was now experiencing the cave. 

"You chose the lifetime package, Mrs. Carter. Are you sure this is what you wanted?"  

She handed me back the folder.  

“The toxicology report indicated he was four times over the drinking limit.”  

“But not Thomas Doyle.”  

“No, not Thomas. ”  

She looked into the room at her husband.  

“Only one person was drunk that night.”  

"John"

"Yes. John" 

I handed her a headset. 

"If you want to be with your daughters, I can make that happen as well."
