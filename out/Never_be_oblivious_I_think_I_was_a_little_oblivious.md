A lot has changed over the course of this last week. I decided to finally leave my house after not hearing from anyone for 11 days now. I figured if something had taken over my social network but hasn’t gotten to me, the last thing I should do is leave the house. This is the only place where I can feel some form of safety after all. I stand up to these entities sometimes but going out regularly in this scenario is just asking for you to not be seen again. 

Nothing in my house had any leads onto what was happening so I figured I’d make a stop to the back rooms of the library. Whenever information on supernatural entities or anything alike is given to the library amongst other reading materials, they always set it aside. The majority of the world considers most of this information as compelled useless. Stories at best. But if they looked at little deeper into our world they’d realise these are the most valuable things we can have to help overcome the darkest elements of our lives. 

The librarians know only a select few people would put this to use and you need to build that notoriety to have access to the backroom. Over the last decade and a half I’ve done exactly that and if there’s anytime that I’d need to visit them, it’d be now.

 I made a calm and collected walk to the car, I knew something out here could be waiting for this exact moment, but I didn’t want them knowing I was prepared for it. I had a small pistol my my waist band and metal lining under my shirt. It wouldn’t be enough to kill anything, but it’d be enough to keep them off me until I was inside of the car. My car is filled with every charm necessary, crammed under the seats,  hanging from the mirrors and covering the dashboard. God knows what other drivers think of me when they look inside while I’m driving past. 

Despite all of this, I made it to the car without anything out of the ordinary happening. You’d think this would be fantastic, but many creatures function off instincts, a lot like an animal. They just see you as prey or some just kill for fun. Clearly whatever was around me had some sort of intellect, or simply wasn’t here at all. Regardless of the 50/50 I had to treat it as if I was being stalked. 

During the car ride into town my head started aching and I was struggling to focus on much, but I noticed it was almost silent. I figured I should see at least a few cars passing by, it was early on a Monday, but I was yet to see anyone. My head felt as if it was being compressed and I was debating turning to just go home and getting back to sleep until it had worn off. I decided I was almost in town and I’d get some medication to try and understand what was happening. I felt as if I’d already left it too long, no more procrastinating.

I pulled up in-front the store and once again found it empty, but my head was under so much pressure I couldn’t find room to care. I tore a pack of antibiotics off the shelf and stumbled into the bathroom. I crashed through the door and pulled myself up toward the sink. As I went to turn the tap on I looked up into the mirror. It was empty. I could see straight through myself. The corners at the top starting folding into each other and I saw a deep, gravitating abyss behind it. 

I threw up across the sink and closed my eyes. I wasn’t able to focus on what the fuck I’d just seen I was too distraught. I opened my eyes and I was back in my car. The overstimulation I was experiencing was enough to throw me into a frenzy but I couldn’t feed into it now. 

I didn’t want to blink again but my head was in so much pain I had to. In the few seconds before I had to prepare myself for whatever I might find before me. I opened them again and I was in between my car and house again, but everything around me was warped inwards and each edge and corner felt like it was tearing at my mind. Every detail of the world looked like fingers and hands trying to grab at my existence. I could feel the prickles on the sides of my head as I tried filtering through my keys to get back into the house. 

My ears were ringing and my throat was so dry I couldn’t swallow anymore. It felt as if all existence was trying to compress me into one atom. I felt the key slide into the door and I clattered through. 

Serene. My head almost exploded at the release of pressure. My ears went mute for a few seconds as I adjusted to normality. I pulled myself up against the wall and looked out the front door. The air was vibrating in the door frame, every little colour and feature outside the house was distorted into one. It looked like space was trying to invade my own house. The hinges of the door started rattling and I slammed it shut instantly. I couldn’t handle whatever that was being inside my house as-well. I felt vacuum packed. Every window and door to my house creaked and groaned from the presence outside pressuring against it.

I fear if I don’t figure out what’s going on I’m going to start hearing splinters in the doors and cracks in the windows. But if there’s anything I’ve learnt, the supernatural always has at least one way where you can win. My friends aren’t the one under attack, I am. I was looking for the wrong things for too long and now I’ve been pinned down to my own house. After having enough time to sit with what’s happened I think I know what’s going on. 

No creature is trying to kill me. The darker world is trying to take me, to remove my history from this world. I don’t know if they want me to be one of them, or if they want to diminish my existence, but I think I know how to find out. There’s always one way out, and I know mirrors have never done what I saw today. I need to take a closer look in my bathroom.
