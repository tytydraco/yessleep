So I’m F15 and I currently have a girlfriend who is 16 years old, we are both in High school and we’ve been dating for around 7 months now and everything has been going nice and smooth until the past few weeks came around.

 It started when she had randomly turned her Snapchat locations off, on a Saturday morning, normally we both share our locations with eachother because trust is a very big thing in every relationship right? she NEVER turned her locations locations off till this point so obviously I got very anxious and started speculating that she was doing dodgy things behind my back. I eagerly sent her over 10 messages just to check everything was okay because I couldn’t just assume she was cheating, I thought that it could’ve been home problems (since she did have a hard home life) but I didn’t get a response as far as that afternoon.

She did reply to me eventually but it was very late at night, and what I mean by middle of the night I mean 3am!! After all of those messages I sent she had given me one dry text “hey babe I’m fine, I went out and got wasted with friends but my phone died” 
Obviously I’d normally believe this and it made tons of sense because my girlfriend was the type of girl to sneak out of her parents flat and go get drunk/high with school mates. But there was still one problem with this, I never understood why her locations where off and why it took her nearly 24 hours to give me an answer when my messages where going through which means her phone was not dead!

2 days passed I forgot about the weird incident and everything went back to normal it was a casual school day and we had a big exam coming up. Normal all of the older teens in my class hang out by a wooded area near our school after school to just chit chat, but weirdly my girlfriend wanted to suddenly go home and study for her exams?? I knew she couldn’t care less about her grades and she flunked school a lot because her parents neglected her from a young age, and now she wanted to randomly decide to start doing better and get an “A+” .. she was in a rush to go too but I didn’t think too much of it and I let her go even though yet again it was strange 

I got home that afternoon and obviously checked her locations again and they were off!! Now I knew something was up this was the second time she did something sneaky like this and btw she always had her locations on, ALWAYS! and not to sound like a stalker but I checked pretty much all the time but she was completely fine with it
She actually enjoyed that I cared about who she was with and where she was. Then I started looking at everyone’s Stories on multiple social media’s just see who she was with and when I couldn’t find anything I really started getting shit scared ..
It was also a school night so i was thinking what the hell could she be doing this time! 

The next day i just had to bring it up at school, but she was being really indirect and suspicious, it was like she wasn’t denying anything but she also wasn’t saying anything that was truthful. It felt like she was pushing me away most of that day and were keeping to herself.. I don’t know what to do help me!!
