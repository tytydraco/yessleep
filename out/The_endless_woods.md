The forest stretched out before me like a sea of shadows, trees clustered so tightly their branches seemed to clutch at one another. I stared at the path if you could call it that, a thin thread of dirt winding its way between trunks older than anything I’d ever seen. The air was still, heavy with the scent of damp earth and moss. I took a deep breath, letting the chill of the morning settle into my bones before stepping forward.

I had come here for solitude, a retreat from the noise of the city, the smog stained skyline, the endless blur of faces that never meant anything. I told myself it would be good for me, that I needed time to think. But as I moved deeper into the woods, that sense of calm I’d hoped for began to fray, unraveling at the edges with every step.

The first mile or so was easy. The trees were familiar, maples and oaks, their leaves whispering in the faint breeze. Sunlight speared through gaps in the canopy, dappling the ground in shifting patterns. I paused occasionally to look back, catching glimpses of the trailhead, the car parked just beyond it, gleaming silver in the sunlight. A reminder of the world I’d left behind, if only for a few days.

But soon the path narrowed, its borders blurred by overgrown brush and creeping vines. I hesitated, glancing back once more. The car was gone from view, swallowed by the folds of the landscape. For a moment, I considered turning back just for a moment. But then I laughed, shaking off the creeping unease that clawed at my chest. I’d read too many ghost stories as a kid. That was all it was.

The trail became more jagged, roots knotting through the soil like skeletal fingers, rocks jutting out at odd angles. I picked my way through carefully, eyes scanning for any sign of markers or trail blazes. I hadn’t seen any since I’d started, but that wasn’t unusual. Some of these old paths were hardly maintained.

The sun climbed higher, its light filtering through the canopy in thin threads. I checked my watch—eleven past noon. I should have been coming up on the clearing by now, a small patch of open ground I’d seen on the map. But the trees only grew denser, the path winding in unpredictable twists and turns.

I stopped and listened. The woods were silent. No birds, no rustle of squirrels in the underbrush, not even the drone of insects. Just silence. My breath sounded harsh in my own ears, a reminder of how far I’d come. I pulled out my phone, glancing at the screen. No signal, of course. Not out here.

I turned back the way I’d come, expecting to see the familiar twists and bends, but the path was different. It veered off to the left where I was sure it had been straight before. I hesitated, staring down the new line of trees that framed the path. Had I really come that way?

A flutter of unease crept in, but I shoved it aside. I must have gotten turned around. It was easy enough to do out here. I retraced my steps, moving quickly now, more certain with every stride. I watched the trees, looking for familiar markings—anything to ground me. But there was nothing.

I paused, heart pounding a little harder than it should have been. I was alone. Completely alone. I took a breath, forcing my mind to still. It was fine. I just needed to backtrack further. I turned again, but the path was gone. Where it had been, there was only underbrush and towering trees, their branches stretching toward one another like bony arms.

I stepped forward, pushing through the foliage. There had to be a trail here. I’d walked it. I’d seen it. My hands shoved branches aside, leaves brushing against my skin like whispers. But there was nothing. No path. Just more trees.

I stopped and looked around. The sun was still overhead, but its light felt muted, distant. I took another breath, slower this time, and told myself to calm down. Panic wouldn’t help. It never did. I just needed to get my bearings.

I turned in a slow circle, marking the direction where the sun hung, and started walking straight. If I kept moving in one direction, I’d have to hit a road, or at the very least, the edge of the woods. That was how it worked.

I walked for what felt like hours. The trees grew thicker, their trunks gnarled and twisted, roots sprawling across the ground like veins. My footsteps grew heavier, the silence pressing against my ears until it felt like I was underwater. I checked my watch. Three-thirty. I’d been walking for nearly four hours.

I stopped. The panic was harder to push away this time, clawing up my throat with every breath. I glanced around. Nothing but trees. Endless, unbroken lines of trees. My heart thudded against my ribs, my hands shaking as I fumbled for my phone. I held it up, staring at the screen. Still no signal. The battery was down to sixty percent.

I swallowed, forcing my breathing to slow. I was just lost. That was all. I’d gotten turned around, maybe wandered off the path, but I’d find it again. I had to.

But when I turned back, the path I’d taken was gone. Not just overgrown—gone. As if it had never been there. The underbrush was untouched, the leaves undisturbed. I took a step back, and then another. My mind spun, grasping for logic, for reason, but none came.

I was alone, in the middle of the woods, and I had no idea how to get out.

My breath came quicker now, my vision blurring at the edges as I fought to keep calm. I forced my legs to move, stumbling forward through the brush. I picked a direction and walked. And walked.

Hours bled into one another. The sun sank lower, shadows stretching like fingers across the ground. I trudged forward, exhaustion gnawing at my bones, my throat raw from thirst. I tried to drink from a stream I found, the water clear and cold, but it only made me more aware of how alone I was.

When the sun finally dipped behind the horizon, the darkness came swift and total. I huddled beneath the trunk of a massive oak, its roots curling around me like ribs. The night was colder than I’d expected, and I shivered beneath my thin jacket. I listened, waiting for the sounds of the forest to wake the croak of frogs, the rustle of leaves, the distant howl of some nighttime predator.

But there was only silence. A silence so complete it pressed against my ears, filling the space where sound should be. I didn’t sleep.

When the dawn came, gray and thin, I rose on stiff legs and continued on. My body ached, my feet raw from endless walking. I checked my watch. Seven-thirty. My phone was down to thirty percent. Still no signal.

I moved through the trees, ignoring the whispers of panic that clawed at my thoughts. I just had to keep moving. That was what mattered. If I kept moving, I’d find the edge. I had to.

But the trees never ended.

They stretched on, twisting and knotting around one another, the path long forgotten. I stopped marking the hours, my steps blurring together into a haze of motion. I drank from streams when I found them, ate wild berries that stained my fingers crimson. I knew the dangers of it, the risks of poison, but hunger gnawed at my stomach with sharp teeth.

Days passed. Or maybe it was only hours. The light barely changed, the sun hovering just beyond the trees, never quite reaching the ground. My watch died. My phone followed soon after. I stopped caring about direction. I just walked.

The trees grew stranger as I moved forward, their bark smooth and pale, their branches bare despite the season. Leaves carpeted the ground, thick and wet, muffling my footsteps until I felt like I was moving through a dream.

I tried to scream once, to shatter the silence. My voice broke the air, raw and jagged, but the trees swallowed it whole. The sound died, leaving only emptiness behind.

And I kept walking.

The woods would not let me go.
