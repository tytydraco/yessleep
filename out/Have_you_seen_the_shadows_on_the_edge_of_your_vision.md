I've always seen them – shadowy figures flickering just on the edge of my vision. As a child, I assumed everyone saw them, a mind's attempt to make sense of what it saw.  My whole life I’ve seen them. I'd turn a corner, catch the glimpse of something, and vanish on a double take. I never really saw what they were, never really thought more about them. That was until about a month ago, when things started to get worse.

I stared blankly at my computer screen, struggling to keep my eyes open, like any other day. My desk, situated in a high-traffic area of the office, faced the main walkway.  It was a spot I’d grown accustomed to over the years, and I found myself glancing up whenever someone walks by. It's a habit, really - a way of staying connected to the world around me.  The computer screen started to blur, I had been staring at the same excel sheet for too long.  That’s when I noticed it.  From the corner of my eye, a shadow, creeping in slowly from around the corner.  So slow, hardly any movement.  Flicking my head over to where it was, was being the keyword.  It was gone.  I remember getting up from my chair, cautiously, because my mind was still racing from what I'd just seen. I had to check, though - I had to make sure I hadn't just missed someone walking by.  Normally when I had seen them, it was just a black shapeless silhouette. No details, no other color. This time it was in a more defined shape.  This time I swear I saw tendrils.  The shadow figure I'd seen earlier seemed to be seared into my brain. I found myself glancing over my shoulder, expecting to see it looming around the corner again.  But was I really seeing it? Or was it all just a product of my own fevered imagination? I started to wonder if I was losing my grip on reality.

I found myself staring blankly at the corner, my breathe coming in rapidly, the tendril wrapping itself around my mind.  What did I see? A shadow.  No.  But what made me look over there?  A shadow of a tendril. No, how could there be a shadow of nothing?  I couldn’t let the questions take over, so I threw myself into my work.  Shaking off the experience.  Letting out my breath slowly, dropping my shoulders.  Going through all the skills I knew for anxiety; I was soon calm.

These shadows never seemed to happen frequently.  At most 2 to 3 times a week at most and that didn’t change.  What did change was the shape. Now I saw detail. I saw the tendrils.  They seemed to extend out from the black body.  At first, I tried to brush it off as mere paranoia, but as the days passed, I found myself becoming increasingly obsessed with catching another glimpse. I started staying awake at night, scouring the room for any sign of movement. And then, it happened. I saw one.  Stretching out from behind the door, I kept my eyes on the tv, not daring to move or blink.  My eyes burned with the need to blink, but I knew I couldn’t look away.  I got you, I thought.  As I watched, the tendril began to move, creeping slowly across the carpet. My breath caught in my throat, and I felt my heart racing with anticipation. But it was no use. My eyes, pleading for relief, burned with the need to blink, but I knew I couldn’t look away.  Ever so slowly I closed my right eye, ignoring the increasing pain in my left. They stayed.  I tried the same process for the left, but as my eye lid started to move, the tendrils retracted with it.  My hands trembled, teeth clenched, I fought.  I couldn’t bare it any longer and blinked.  They were gone. I cursed at myself, frustrated and defeated.  Hours of waiting, wasted with one blink. And now, I have to be at work in an hour. Grumpily, I got up, rubbed my eye, and stumbled towards the coffee maker. Work was going to suck.
