Normally I wouldn’t post stuff like this, let alone believe in it, but I feel like I need to let this off my chest. Maybe not for answers, because I doubt anyone will have any, but perhaps it will make me less uneasy. Does anyone have any idea what this could be? Or maybe some Swede out there that has seen something similar?

Just a few weeks ago I got my drivers license and I’ve even bought an old car right after. I’ve almost been out driving every single day and pretty much always alone, since I don’t have any friends, only acquaintances. Most of the time, I drive on kind of off grid roads and foresty roads, since that’s what most roads are around me (I live in one of the most sparsely populated area in northern Sweden). 

I have personally never been afraid of the forest, having lived surrounded by it all my life and always enjoyed the tranquility of it (not during hunting season, obviously). However, I have always had an extreme respect for it. I guess the stories about folklore and myths my grandparents have told me all my life has really set its mark on me. 

Anyways, to get to the point of this whole post… Just a few days ago I was out for a drive again. It’s been pissing rain over here lately and bound to my shitty luck, the roads were practically collapsing, not that I’d expect anything else from the mainly gravel and dirt roads I drive on. Unlucky as I am the road has some sort of its own mini landslide and I end up in the ditch. 

Not thinking much of it, since I’ve dealt with it before with other vehicles, I simply step out into the rain and see if I can get it up without calling for help. I could, pretty easily, luckily. Like I said before, I’ve never been scared of the forest but this day I felt uncharacteristically and unusually uneasy, like I was being watched. I didn’t think much of it and instead focused on getting the shitbox car up on the road. 

Finally back on track I started the car and went to drive off again, I noticed a figure in the rear view mirror. Mind you, this is in the middle of fucking nowhere in rural Sweden, probably about at least an and a half hour walk away from any civilization and the tiny town I live in and where the trees are so densely grown you can barely walk anywhere but the road. Of course, the forest comes with its animals, but this was different. I’ve dealt with deers and moose before, even some boars up close, but I’ve never felt this much like being eyed as prey. 

The figure was probably about 190cm tall man standing on two legs, built almost like a regular human but the head wasn’t like a human’s, almost like a goat’s or deer’s instead.  I couldn’t see if it was wearing something or not, only that it looked like a tanish color. Of course, I know this sounds like the most cliché, fake story ever. Believe me or don’t, I fucking pissed myself when I saw it (not literally). 

I genuinely don’t know what to make of this, but I just had to tell someone about it. My parents already view me as some introvert, nature nerd that has zero social skills and no real sense of purpose, so telling them feels like signing up for getting forced into the psych ward. Despite what I saw, I’m thinking of driving back there. I probably won’t see anything or it again, but now I’m both upset and obsessed with not having answers. 

Does anyone have any other ideas of what it could be? Or am I just as loony as my parents think.
