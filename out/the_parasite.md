I'm writing this because I don’t think I’ll ever be able to say it out loud without sounding insane.

My uncle owns a farm in a pretty isolated area. Fields, animals, and a lake behind the property. I stayed with him for a while to help with work and keep him company.

It started with the animals.

Not disappearing. Just…damaged.

One morning we found chickens with deep wounds, still alive. Another day, a sheep with its side torn open. A pig with chunks missing from its neck and back. Whatever was doing it wasn’t trying to kill quickly. It was feeding and leaving.

Each day, there were more.

My uncle assumed a predator. A wild animal that came at night. He set up cameras around the pens and near the house to see what was sneaking in.

The footage showed nothing.
No animals. No movement. No shadows. Just empty frames.

After a few days, things went quiet. No new injured animals. No dead ones either.

That’s when my aunt showed up.

She hadn’t visited in years, but it wasn’t strange enough to question. She said she was passing by and wanted to see how things were going. She looked completely normal. Clean clothes. Dry hair. Calm voice. She hugged my uncle. Came inside. Sat at the table. Talked about family stuff. Old memories. Nothing alarming.

I remember thinking how relieving it felt to have someone else there. She stayed for about ten minutes before I noticed something was off. Not obvious. Just small things. She barely blinked. Asked questions that felt rehearsed. Didn’t eat or drink anything. And there was a faint smell, like stagnant water, hanging around her clothes.

My uncle noticed too. I could see it in his face. Then she said she wanted to see the lake. My uncle hesitated. Said maybe later. She insisted, smiling the whole time. Her smile didn’t change, even when his tone did.

That’s when he told me to go to my room and lock the door.

I didn’t.

I hid behind the corner near the back window. From there, I could see the yard and part of the path to the lake.

They went outside.

At first, it looked like a normal conversation. Then she stepped closer to him. Too close. Her head tilted slightly, like she was listening to something else.

My uncle staggered.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t fight. He just… dropped. Like someone had turned him off.

That’s when I realized she hadn’t touched him.

She grabbed him by the arms and started dragging him toward the lake. And as she walked, she changed.

Not dramatically. No snapping bones or loud transformations. Her posture straightened. Her movements became smoother. Purposeful. The way a person walks when they know exactly where they’re going.

Her face stopped trying to look like my aunt’s.

Skin dulled. Expression emptied. Eyes lost focus. The smell got stronger. Wet. Rotten. By the time she reached the edge of the lake, she didn’t look like anyone anymore.

Just something tall. Humanoid. Pale. A parasite dragging my uncle like he weighed nothing.

I stayed frozen, watching from the shadows.

She stepped into the water without hesitation. The lake didn’t ripple the way it should’ve. It swallowed them quietly.

I waited. Minutes passed.

Nothing came back up.

I ran.

I didn’t take anything. I didn’t check the cameras. I didn’t even look back at the house.

Later, the footage showed my uncle walking out with her. Calm. Normal. Like he trusted her.

The camera near the lake cut out just before they reached the water.

The animals were never attacked again.

I don’t know what lives in that lake. I don’t know how long it’s been there.

But I know this:

If someone you love shows up out of nowhere, acts normal, stays just a little too long, don’t let them take you outside.
