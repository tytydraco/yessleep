A few nights ago, something happened that I still can’t quite wrap my head around. It wasn’t dramatic or anything, but it was strange enough that it’s been lingering in my mind ever since.

It was a little after midnight, and I was getting ready to go to bed. I live in a quiet neighborhood, where most people are in bed by 10 PM, so it’s usually dead silent by that time. I had just turned off the lights when I heard a knock on my door. It wasn’t a frantic knock just a slow, steady tap-tap-tap, like whoever it was didn’t want to disturb me too much.

At first, I thought I was hearing things. Who would be knocking on my door at this hour? I checked my phone to see if I’d missed any messages or calls, but there was nothing. I waited a minute, hoping it was just my imagination, but then the knocking started again, a little louder this time.

I’m not usually the type to answer the door late at night, especially when I’m not expecting anyone, but something made me get up and check. I looked through the peephole and saw my neighbor, an older man who lives a few houses down. I don’t know him well just a few friendly nods in passing—but he’s always seemed nice enough.

I hesitated for a moment, then opened the door a crack. “Hey, everything okay?” I asked, trying to sound casual even though I was a little freaked out.

He looked at me with this strange expression, like he was trying to figure something out. “I’m sorry to bother you so late,” he said, his voice calm but serious. “But I need to ask you something.”

“Sure,” I replied, still not sure where this was going.

He glanced around, as if making sure no one else was around, then leaned in slightly and asked, “Did you hear it too?”

Now, this caught me off guard. “Hear what?” I asked, confused.

“The music,” he said, lowering his voice. “It’s been playing for the last hour. It stopped just before I came over.”

I hadn’t heard any music. My house was quiet, and the neighborhood seemed as silent as ever. I told him as much, but he just shook his head, looking more concerned.

“It was coming from around here,” he insisted, pointing vaguely toward my house or maybe the street in front of it. “I thought it might have been coming from your place, but if you didn’t hear it...”

I assured him that I hadn’t heard anything and asked if he was sure it wasn’t coming from somewhere else. He frowned, like he was trying to make sense of it. “I checked outside, walked around the block even. It was strange like old-timey music, something from a different era. And then, just like that, it stopped.”

We stood there for a moment in awkward silence, neither of us sure what to say next. Finally, he sighed and apologized again for bothering me. “Maybe I’m just hearing things,” he said, though he didn’t sound convinced. “Sorry to have bothered you.”

I watched him walk back down the street, and as I closed the door, I couldn’t shake the weirdness of the whole encounter. I’ve never heard any strange music around here, and the fact that he was so adamant that it was coming from near my house made it even stranger.

The next day, I asked a couple of other neighbors if they’d heard anything, but no one had. I even walked around the block myself, trying to see if there was anything that could explain what he heard, but everything seemed normal.

Since that night, I haven’t heard anything out of the ordinary, and I haven’t seen my neighbor around either. Maybe it was just a weird coincidence, or maybe he really did hear something that I didn’t. I don’t know, but it’s been stuck in my mind, making me a little more aware of the quiet nights around here.

Now, every time I hear a faint sound, I find myself listening a little more closely, wondering if I’ll ever hear that mysterious music too.
