This happened back in sixth grade, but I still remember every second of it. Me and a friend were sent to grab some capos from our school’s Performing Arts Centre (PAC) for our band practice. We weren’t expecting anything weird—just grab the capos and go.

But the second we opened the PAC door, we knew something was off.

There was this massive semicircle of chairs, maybe twenty or thirty of them, arranged around this old, fraying rug in the centre of the room. The rug looked ancient—dark blue with faded purple, orange, and yellow dots. Some threads were pulled apart at the edges, and there were rips all through it, like it had been... used a lot. But not in a normal way.

The whole room felt cold. Quiet. Way too quiet. Even when we turned on the lights, they flickered, stuttered—and then just gave out completely.

“What happened here?” my friend asked.

“I don’t know,” I said. It was all I could think of.

We went over to the corner where the capos usually were—near stacks of chairs and some whiteboards. I started digging through the drawers while my friend kept glancing around, clearly nervous.

Then she screamed.

I spun around just in time to see the bathroom door slowly shut. That door is always open. There’s no draft in that room. No windows. And it didn’t slam—it *closed*. Like someone was behind it.

“Did you see that?!” she yelled. “It closed itself! What the heck!”

We went over to check, of course. That bathroom’s weird anyway—it’s like a little room with three doors inside: middle for unisex, left for girls, right for boys. We opened each one. Nothing inside.

My friend was freaking out and begged to leave. I didn’t argue. We headed back to the music room, where our band was waiting. She kept muttering “Oh god, oh god” under her breath, and the others noticed something was up. We just said “nothing” and tried to brush it off.

But we only found one capo.

So we had to go back.

She was nervous, but I felt…drawn. Like I needed to know more. Maybe it was some staff setup? But the way that door had moved, the lights, the silence—none of it made sense.

Halfway there, one of our bandmates caught up with us. Apparently, the others had sent her to check on us because we were acting weird. We let her come with.

When she saw the PAC, she immediately picked up on the weird vibes. Everything was *exactly* the same—chairs, rug, darkness. As we searched again, we heard banging.

On the walls. Inside the building. But the PAC is a stand-alone building—there’s nothing on the other side of those walls.

Then we heard the wail.

It came from the bathroom. It didn’t sound human. I’ve never heard anything like it.

We checked again. This time, the lights inside the bathroom were dead too. We called out—“Is anyone there?”—but no one answered.

Then there was a crash.

We ran out and saw that the chairs that had been stacked neatly in the corner were all over the floor. One of the whiteboards had fallen too. The blinds were shaking. The kitchen sink on the side of the room was running at full blast.

We didn’t stop to think. We just ran.

Back in the music room, our friends were staring at us like we were insane. We tried to play it off, but then the teacher who sent us came over, asking if we’d found the capos.

We mentioned the semicircle of chairs. That was all we dared to say.

He frowned. “Why are they set up like that?”

“We don’t know,” my friend said.

So he came with us. For the third time.

By now my friend looked like she was going to cry. But we followed him in—and everything was still there. The chairs. The rug.

Then one of the chairs tipped over.

No wind. No one touched it. It just fell.

The teacher didn’t say anything for a second. Then, suddenly: “Girls. Go back to the music room.”

“But—” I started.

“Now.”

So we left. We talked about it in hushed whispers, trying to make sense of what we’d seen.

And then I remembered something.

“Guys,” I said. “Today’s the Day of the Dead.”

They stared at me like I had just betrayed them.

Later, we asked the teacher if he found out what was going on.

He just said, “It’s alright.”

But it *wasn’t*.

The next day, we tried to go back. The door was locked.

The next time we entered the PAC, it was for graduation. The chairs were gone. The rug was gone. Like none of it ever happened.

But it did.

And I still don’t know who—or *what*—that semicircle of chairs was meant for.
