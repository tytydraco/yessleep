1853; the west was still to be tamed.

 It was in this year we find the establishment of Camp Elliot. As you might know through some knowledge of niche history, this camp was founded by a caravan composed of twelve men all looking to set up their own settlement. The caravan was led by a “Jonathan Elliot”. He came from Seattle, back before it had even known that name. Since leaving the freshly dug out city, ambitions set on their own prospect, the company had already been travelling for about 3 days. In their overt ambition, they became careless. They had run low on fresh water, heads pounding and tongues gone dry. 

So, temporarily pitched in the wilderness, Mr. Elliot decided to send out a six-man party to search for some. He told them to stay together and not to come back until they found at least a pail’s worth of water. The six men went out. They stayed out for some three hours, until the sun was in its crimson crest; and the search was becoming hopeless. 

“We have to go back!” some had said. Others argued otherwise, sticking to what Mr. Elliot had instructed. To the latter, they caved; and it came to be a mistake. 

It soon got pitch dark and they had nothing but matches to see some inches past their faces. A panic quickly ensued. Many were on the verge of a breakdown, almost certain they were lost. 

Suddenly, there was a light. It was spotted first by the chief of the party. It was some ways off in the distance, pulsing in the night. 

They quickly calmed, believing they had found their caravan once again. They approached, clambering over branches and rocks, scraping more than just their knees. 

Before long, the light had become much more recognizable. It was a torch. The party chief ordered the other five men to prepare their rifles. They feared it to be anything. Hostile prospectors, moonshiners, perhaps a native tribe that had been left undisturbed or for that matter discovered. They walked covertly; coming to the edge of what turned out to be a clearing in the trees. In the clearing was a lake; Arrowhead Lake it would come to be known as. 

Standing on its shore, there were people; practically a riot. A group of shirtless men were seen dancing around a fire, reciting chants and rhymes in their own special tongue. One of them held a large rock in their right hand, a pointed arrow in his left. 
The rest of the men seemed to be goading him, applauding him in this bizarre ritual. 

These weren’t natives. They were pale as ice, eyes surrounded by darkness. Their hair was all but present. They almost didn’t seem human. 

Just then, one of the party members fired. The battle was short, but one of the so-called “drunks” managed to take down one of the six men with a bow-and-arrow. 

That is where the Arrowhead Lake received its name. 

The remaining five of the party slept by the fire until dawn, not bothering to look over their attackers’ belongings until then. They were too busy in mourning over the loss of their companion. 

The next day, what they found was, for lack of a better word, disturbing. 

What they had thought was a rock in the hand of one of their attackers was actually a small green turtle. The man who had held it had cut it open with the arrow, leaving it limp, distorted, and bloody. 

But that wasn’t the most unsettling aspect. The blood on its body wasn’t red. It was pitch black. Black as ink. As black as the night upon which it was gutted. 

Believing it to be poison, the men threw the mangled turtle’s corpse into the lake; tossing it as far out as they could. A couple of hours went by, and Jonathan Elliot with the other six in the caravan had then found the party and the lake. A brief funeral and burial were held for their one fallen man as well as his attackers. 

What followed was a conversation, a debate over what to do next. In the end, plans for a cabin were sorted out. The cabin was finished in 1855 and still stands on the Camp Elliot grounds to this day.

That is not where this tale ends, however.

After about a month of it being open, a strange power came over the camp. Each time that a caravan would stop to do business or even rest awhile, another person from the original founding group would have gone missing. They hadn’t died, they hadn’t moved on to elsewhere. They would just vanish. 

Then another would follow. Then another, and another, and another. With each time someone would visit, the camp would be found in worse shape than it was before. 

Then came one day in 1856: a caravan of travelling salesmen had come to the camp, looking to do some trade. What they found was a single person: Jonathan Elliot, the titular founder of Camp Elliot. He was found tucked beneath his bed, cradled himself into a ball, malnourished and in bad health. Members of the caravan described a look of pure madness in his eyes as he said something over and over. It was a single phrase, hard to make out, but it was something like, “NO GOLD HERE! NO GOLD HERE!”

He never spoke any other words beside these. What with it being the era of the gold rush, the claim from the sales caravan upon returning to Seattle was that a group of maddened prospectors had attacked the camp in search of gold, killing all except for himself. They would have brought him back to Seattle with them, but in a fit of hysteria, he put a rifle in his mouth before they could. 

In the passing of time since then, the camp has been claimed by many other groups, each coming and going. At one time, it was a trading post. Then it became a mine again but no ores were ever unearthed. So it seemed that Elliot was right. Then finally, in 1916, it became a Boy Scout camp; and so it has been ever since. 

As for the mystery of this place, there is something about it they often say. On certain nights, ones where the lake is its darkest and the moon and stars are almost extinguished, a shadow arises.

Nobody knows who of. Nobody knows what of. All they know is that it utters an ungodly sound, a sound that resembles nothing of this earth; nothing of this reality. 

Some who have seen the shadow are often too afraid to describe what it looked like. Others have not even lived to tell others. But their suicides have confirmed their experience. 

Now why do I write all of this? Because I have seen it. I was a counselor at Camp Elliot. The night that I saw it, it was just outside my window; staring me down like a wolf as I lay in my cot. Though I apparently had the mental strength to take it, to describe it in full would go against my superstitions. I care too much for others to risk you all sharing in my experience. But I will admit this: that no primal beast on this earth can bring such feelings of helplessness and desolation as the crimson gaze of its plate-like eyes. 

And I felt all the more helpless the next morning when I came to find that another child had gone missing. They searched in all manner of ways for months and the case remains open; as do the others that preceded it. 

The shadow exists. Likely borne of whatever unnatural and unholy ritual was performed at Arrowhead Lake; a ritual the caravan had unknowingly completed. It has taken men, women, and children; and it will continue to take more. That’s why now, all I can do is lobby to finally close that damned camp for good. It is the one piece of land I think in all the West that can never be tamed…and it never should be. 

Knowing all these things, I realize now that Jonathan Elliot was right. 

There is no God at Camp Elliot. Not until Judgment Day.
