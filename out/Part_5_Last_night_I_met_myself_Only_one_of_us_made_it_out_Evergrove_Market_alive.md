I clocked in at 10 p.m., yesterday’s images still clawing at the back of my skull. The man’s scream. The wet, splintering snap of bone.

I always knew this job could kill me. But last night was the first time I watched it kill someone else. The first time I understood what waits for me if I ever slip. The old man was there again, standing in his usual place like a figure in a painting. “There’s a new shipment at the loading dock,” he said, clipboard steady in his hand. “Bring it in before you start.”

I dropped my bag on the counter. “Yeah,” I muttered. He glanced up at me. “Are you alright?”

That simple, casual question—so human, so normal—snapped something inside me.

“You don’t even know what happens in Phase Three, do you?” My voice cracked, louder than I intended. “I just watched someone die last night, old man! Right in front of me!” For a heartbeat, he just studied me. His face didn’t change. Not even a blink.

“Two more nights,” he said quietly. “Just hold on.” I laughed, sharp and bitter. “That’s easy for you to say.” And when I looked back, he was gone, like he’d never been there.

I hauled the shipment in on autopilot. Tore open boxes. Tried not to think. But the quiet pressed closer with every second. Evergrove’s silence doesn’t just sit there.

It leans in.

It listens.

Even the shipment felt wrong. Too many cans of beans. Like the store was quietly replacing everything with beans, one pallet at a time.

The Pale Lady drifted in right on schedule, her feet never aligning correctly to her body. I didn’t look up. “Freezer aisle,” I said. My voice came out flat and empty. She floated past, leaving behind a cold, iron-scented draft. Of all the things that haunt these aisles, she’s the most predictable. And here, predictability almost feels like mercy. When she disappeared, I went back to the cabinet.

If there was anything in here that could stop another night like last night, I had to find it. But all I found was madness. The papers weren’t even words anymore—just curling, wormlike symbols that wriggled whenever I blinked. The ledger sat in the center, radiating a steady, suffocating No.

I shut the cabinet panel, throat tight, and drifted down the hallway toward the bathrooms. That’s when I remembered:

**Don’t take the promotion.**

The note from my first night.

For a moment, I almost let myself believe someone wanted to help me. Then I checked the time: 1:55 a.m.

And another rule whispered through my head:

**Do not use the bathroom between 1:33 a.m. and 2:06 a.m. Someone else is in there. They do not know they are dead.**

I turned to leave.

And froze.

“Heeeelloooo? Is someone out there? Can you open the door?”

The voice was faint, muffled by the door—but unmistakably human. The rule never said I couldn’t talk and I don’t know if it was desperation or plain stupidity, but against my better judgment, I talked.

Just… don’t open the door.

I swallowed hard. “Who… who are you?”

The voice brightened instantly, full of desperate hope.

“Oh! Finally! My name’s Selene. You scared me—I thought I was stuck here alone forever! Are you a customer?”

“No,” I said carefully. “I work here.”

There was a pause. Then confusion.

“…But I work here. Wait. What? Who are you?”

“I’m Remi.”

Another pause.

“I don’t know a Remi. When did they hire you? Are you sure you work here?”

“Yeah, I am pretty sure,” I said, thinking of all the times this store had tried to kill me.

“When?” Selene asked. “Because me, Jack, and Stacy—we all got hired last month. August.”

I frowned. “…August? It’s July. And… who are Jack and Stacy?”

The voice gave a small, nervous laugh.

“They are the people I work with. Jack’s tall, dark hair, never stops joking. Stacy’s blonde. Shy. She doesn’t like night shifts. Please—please tell me they’re okay, ‘cause they are supposed to be working but something happened so I am hiding. You should hide too, Remi.”

I pressed my ear against the door.

“I’ve never met them or you. I started here in June. Last month.”

A sharp inhale.

“June? No, that’s not… no, silly. It’s September right now.”

“No, it’s July. July 2025.”

“No, silly, it’s September 1998.”

The cold that slid through me wasn’t from the air conditioning.

I remembered the rule again.

**They do not know they are dead.**

There was no point in arguing. But maybe I could collect some more information about the store or maybe about what happened to this Jack and Stacy.

“…Selene, do you know what happened?”

For a long moment, nothing. Just her slow, uneven breathing.

Then, soft and trembling:

“There was a man. He wasn’t right. His skin was so pale it almost glowed, and just looking at him made me feel sick. He came in after two. Jack was supposed to ring the bell three times. That’s the rule. But I distracted him. He forgot. And then—”

Her voice cracked.

“The Pale Man grabbed him. Dragged him into the aisles. I hid in here. I’ve been hiding ever since.”

I closed my eyes. Now leaning against the door “How long have you been hiding, Selene?”

“Since… that night. I still hear him screaming sometimes. It also is really hot in this bathroom, is the air conditioning not working? I just have to wait until he comes back. Do you think… do you think he’s okay? Is Stacy alright?”

My chest tightened so hard it hurt.

“…Selene,” I whispered, “Jack isn’t coming back.”

“No,” she said softly, like a child refusing bedtime. “No, you’re wrong. I just have to wai-.”

And then—silence.

Not a whisper.

Not a breath.

For a long moment I stood there, ear pressed against the cold bathroom door, listening to the weight of that absence. I saw the clock on my phone, it read 2:06 am.

My throat was raw when I finally muttered, “Well. I guess now I can use the bathroom.” The joke tasted like dust in my mouth as I pushed the door open slowly.

Inside, the fluorescent light buzzed weakly overhead, washing everything in that washed-out yellow-grey that makes skin look dead.

The stall doors stood open.

Empty.

No Selene.

Only a single scrap of paper stuffed behind the mirror, the same place I had found the promotion note, written in shaky block letters:

“my name is selene...”

The handwriting looked frantic, like someone trying to leave proof that they’d been real. I tore my eyes away. The air inside was so thick with heat it felt alive. I left to find the ledger.

And this time, I wasn’t just curious. I needed to see her name. The store’s aisles stretched out before me, all pristine and quiet again—as if none of it had happened.

I walked back to the cabinet. To the ledger. I hated that thing. Hated how it seemed to wait for me. Still, my fingers reached for it like they didn’t belong to me. The air around it vibrated faintly, and for the first time since clocking in, I realized I was shaking.

I needed answers.

Even the wrong ones.

Inside, the pages weren’t paper so much as skin. The ink sank into it like veins. I flipped past symbols that moved when I blinked, past names I didn’t dare read out loud, until I found it.

Selene XXXXX.

The letters swam, like they knew I was watching.

Beneath her name, rules were circled and written in that same, perfect, merciless hand:

**Rule 6 – Ring the bell three times before the Pale Man appears. If you fail: hide.**

**Rule 7 – Do not leave the premises during your scheduled shift unless authorized.**

A red slash ran straight through her name.

I turned the page.

Jack.

The same rules.

The same slash.

And Stacy…

Hers too.

But hers had something else.

Under Stacy’s name, in handwriting that didn’t match the rest—small, cramped, almost gleeful:

“Attempted arson. Store cannot be harmed by mere humans. Terminated.”

The word terminated was written like a sneer.

Selene had said Jack was supposed to ring the bell. He broke the rule. But the ledger showed all three of their names slashed. With the rule being under all of their names.

I stared at the page, and something ugly clicked in my head.

The price of one person’s mistake wasn’t just their life. It was everyone’s. Even if you follow the rules, if your teammate slips—you pay.

Jack forgot the bell.

Selene didn’t know what that mistake would cost them—she thought hiding would keep her safe. But Stacy must have realized.

She must have known that Jack’s failure meant all three of them were already as good as dead.

She didn’t hide.

She tried to run.

She tried to burn this place down on the way out.

Selene had told me it was hot in the bathroom.

I’d thought it was just fear. Or broken air conditioning. Now I knew better. She’d burned to death.

And her ghost had been waiting there ever since, still thinking hiding would save her. My eyes went back to that last line.

The style of those letters.

That scornful, curling stroke.

It was the Night Manager’s handwriting.

I’d seen it once before on the card that is still stashed in the cereal section. He’d been the one to terminate her. He’d made sure of it.

My hands snapped the ledger shut. The air around me felt wrong, heavy—like the store itself had been listening to me figure it out. And then the bell over the front door chimed.

It was 2:45 a.m. The bell didn’t just ring—it cut. A cold, serrated sound that sliced straight into my skull. And with it came the rule, whispering like ice water trickling down my spine:

Rule Four: **Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m.**

I inched open the office door, just enough to peek. And froze. There, in the reception lounge, standing under the weak fluorescent lights—was me.

Same hair.

Same uniform.

Same everything.

Only… wrong.

Another rule slammed through my brain, louder this time, like someone was shouting it inside my head:

Rule Three: **A second you may arrive at any time. Do not speak to them. Do not let them speak to you. If they say your name, cover your ears and run to the cleaning supply closet. Lock the door. Count to 200. Wait for silence.**

The closet was near the loading dock.

Past the basement.

Past her.

I ran.

“Reeeeeeemiiiii…”

My own voice followed.

But it wasn’t my voice. It was wet, like it was gargling blood, dragging the syllables through mud.

The footsteps changed. They weren’t behind me anymore. They were ahead. Coming from the direction of the closet.

I spun.

I bolted the other way.

She was faster.

So much faster.

And the closer she got, the more wrong she became:

She looked like me, she sounded like me, but there was nothing human behind those eyes.

It was wearing my skin like a cheap costume.

That’s when I saw the canned goods aisle and remembered.

Rule Five: **Something new lives behind the canned goods aisle. If you hear it breathing, whistle softly as you walk by. It hates silence.**

I had always obeyed.

Until now.

I lunged for the nearest cart—heavy, overstuffed with beans—and shoved it between us, crouching low behind the snack shelves directly across the canned food aisle. My heart was pounding so violently I couldn’t feel my hands anymore.

Her footsteps dragged closer.

Closer.

Closer.

The shadow of my own body lunged past—

And I shoved.

The cart smashed into her, hurling her behind the aisle.

For one brief, doomed second, I thought it would just slow her down.

Then the shelves moved.

No—they breathed.

They split open like a mouth.

The cans burst with wet, meaty pops. From inside, pale worms spilled out like ropes, long and slick, hissing as they hit the floor. They swarmed her.

Into her eyes.

Her mouth.

Everywhere.

She screamed.

And it was my scream. My voice, clawing and ripping at itself, torn apart from the inside out. I could feel it in my own throat, like it was happening to me.

I ran.

I ran with my hands clamped over my ears, but I couldn’t stop hearing it: My own voice—shredded into ribbons, choking, gasping, splintering until it was nothing but wet gurgles.

I locked myself in the closet and counted.

“200

201...”

I counted until my voice gave out.

I counted long after the noise stopped.

When I finally opened the door, sunlight poured in.

The store was perfect again. Stocked. Clean.

No worms.

No blood.

The cart was gone.

The old man was waiting, clipboard in hand. “You made it,” he said, like he was congratulating a child for finishing a board game.

I stared at him. Empty. “Two nights left, Remi,” he said softly. “Then your final evaluation.”

I walked past him on autopilot. But inside?

Inside, I was still screaming.

And the worst part?

It sounded exactly like her.
