Ok, I posted this story in a few other communities yesterday and it seems like the vast majority of people were intrigued. If you haven’t already, and are curious, go back and read my last post to get caught up. I’ve linked it right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/Qywx56z2Zi

Additionally, if there’s a better way for me to link everything together on here please let me know as I’m not much of a frequent poster on here. 

Against my better judgement, I’ve decided to upload more. I’m writing this on the flight back home, as a preface to this next post. Contained in the package we found before leaving the island was a journal with loose pages placed carefully in between certain pages, and a hard drive, along with a note that served as a precursor to what was in the journal. What you are reading next is the word for word firsthand account of the man in the bunker. It reads almost eerily like a story at times, to which I can only assume was the result of a man who knew he was on borrowed time trying to put that reality aside for the sake of whoever found this (There are a lot of entries in this journal, so I will most likely be breaking it up again, whether for the sake of me typing it, or in order to give myself a second chance to stop digging and bury this once more):

…

(This was the note attached to the outside of the package)

Forgive me for any crude and borderline illiterate mistakes as my only method of recording these events lies with this dingy old typewriter I found on a desk in these old quarters.  This note, along with my personal logbook will be hidden away in hopes one day it finds someone who knows what to do with this information. If you are reading this, then maybe you are that person, otherwise… well I don’t know how else to say it other than good luck. The pages of this book are firsthand accounts of the preceding weeks and the events that transpired… The additional typed pages I am now working on will be put in chronological order to fill gaps in those retellings.

Additionally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, there is a hard drive tucked within the contents of this package. If you are going to open it, have a plan. They will come for you. They won’t risk anyone else knowing this, and I’m already on the clock. I risked my life for that drive in ways I only wish to have to recall one last time… It is a raw download of all the files and data stored and recorded in the ships computer system. Play the audio and video files if you must, but hopefully my words are deterrent enough. They serve as nothing more than evidence, and are described in detail when applicable. I know my time is limited as they’ve surely figured out someone is missing by now. I managed to get off that ship in a stolen life raft… Made it out here to the lighthouse. On this island. Or what’s left of the island.

For what it’s worth, a bit about me: I joined the marines back in the early 2000s as a means to pay for education. After a brief stint in the military, I went on to pursue physics, eventually narrowing my field of study to quantum theory. I don’t have time to explain great detail some of the projects I’ve been a part of, but a lot of it pertains to multi-dimensional research. Fast forward to three weeks ago. I got a call from an old Captain I had on my first deployment. It was very odd to hear from him seeing as we hadn’t kept in touch, but I remembered him nonetheless. He said he found my contact information through the school directory I had been doing research at. I knew a temporary research assistant wouldn’t have a page on their directory. But before I could question it, he asked if I had time to meet that evening. It was all very odd and fast but I agreed. He cut the line immediately after, and a few hours later I was on my way to the diner we agreed upon. 

There was Captain Downes, wearing a dark baseball cap tilted to cover his face, seated in a booth by the window. Before I could say anything, upon my sitting he opened his jacket and pulled out a Manila folder. He slid it towards me. SCI was stamped in bold red letters across the words on the folder: Project T.R.I.A.D. At the bottom in small text, the words “Property of United States Government” were underlined by the edge of the folder. I recalled SCI standing for “Secret Compartmentalized Information”, and is the government’s highest clearance level, although I never was privy to anything at that level during my time in the military. “I wouldn’t be doing this if it wasn’t urgent.” He interrupted. 

I flipped open the folder, inside was littered with old photos of a town under construction. “Back in 1915, right after World War One had just began, the government knew that the United States was far behind other nations when it came to scientific and technological breakthroughs, despite what the history books say. As a result, Wilson sent a whole lot of taxpayer dollars to fund a secret research project, hidden behind a government sanctioned paper trail. There’s not a lot about what the goal was other than to militarize some sort of breakthrough these scientists were after.” The photos were black and white, one depicting a small cul-de-sac. There were figures dressed up, but they weren’t people, they were mannequins. The Captain went on.

“There was a small island off the coast of New Zealand that had been bought by the government under a bunch of fake shell corporations. It was supposed to serve as the base of operations for the experiment. Despite their best efforts to scrub it, officially the record is that it was simply a way-to-early attempt at what later became the basis for the Manhattan Project.” That’s what those photos were. It was of a bomb testing site. The cars, the mannequins, the suburban houses, all very set up to look like a superficial town living the American dream. I slid the next photo behind the other papers and began scrutinizing the next one. It was of a tall lighthouse. It seemed very out of place considering it was just sitting on the near horizon behind the manufactured cul-de-sac.

“And unofficially?” I asked. Captain stiffened a bit. “There was some truth to the cover up. At first they were aiming to make some sort of weapon. There’s a few pages photocopied in there that explains more on it. I’m sure you’ll understand more than I will.” I found it. It was dated August 1, 1915 and was formatted like a report. It was outlining a lot of theory and hypothesis, along with rudimentary schematics. I only took a few classes that covered topics in nuclear physics during my studies, but from what I understood the information was about how the project was indeed for a nuclear bomb. At the time however, containing fusion and/or fission reactions was out of the question considering the given technologies. 

A group of scientists had theorized that they could harness enough energy from targeted and contained electromagnetic radiation as a means to initiate a detonation process. The big appeal was that it allowed for the device to be armed from safe distances, so long as the energy could be directed properly. There was a diagram that was sketched out which looked like a spotlight, only double sided, with equations and part numbers labeled all over. Captain Downes started talking again as I looked over the document.

“So basically they put this device at the top of that lighthouse. The town was then built as a contained environment for testing. At first it was working great. The test records show success after success for over a year. They’d shine the beam from the ‘lighthouse’ at the explosive device, and it would activate. It was silent, and basically untraceable. The implications of what they made became vast and the scientists concluded that since the war was over, they couldn’t let this project go any further.”

“So what happened next?” I asked with the curiosity of a child. “They buried it. Literally. Or at least tried.” He responded. I was confused. “There was a final test scheduled, and it failed miserably. They initiated what was called Erosion Protocol.” I pulled out a paper titled “Erosion Protocol and Procedures for Site Shrapnel.” Another post war document photocopy. In summary it said that the island was located on a fault line that ran alongside a deep ocean canyon. Before anyone stepped foot on the island, shortly after the government purchased it, high powered explosives were dug into the earth along the island, following the track of the fault line. Basically if things went awry, the plan was to detonate the explosives and sink all the evidence of this project down to the bottom of the sea. And that’s what happened.

“Now the last part of the story is that the scientists actually completed the test. They planned to tamper with the device beforehand so it would seize up and fail beyond repair. Whatever they did had the reverse effect and it harnessed levels of energy beyond what they could handle and the machine started sending out bursts of energy. The bursts should have faded but instead created what the reports refer to as ‘dimensional ripples.’ So hey sunk the whole town and all the facilities on the island related to that project. The only thing left is the old standing lighthouse and a few old scattered maintenance buildings or crew quarters from way back when it was in use.”

“A few weeks ago there’s a file sitting on my desk on the base when I get into work in the morning. That file.” He pointed at the folder in my hands. “Threshold Reconnaissance, Investigation, Assessment, and Dissolution. Project TRIAD. A few days ago, a private ocean research company, MaritimeX, had a vessel out near the island conducting sonar scans for seabed mapping. They were operating close to the site of the underwater canyon and they lost two submersibles. They notified the coast guard and about 48 hours later pieces of the submersibles began just floating up to the surface. They all looked to have severe heat damage and burn marks.” 

In the folder were pictures of the wreckage described on the deck of a very large ship. “Their submersibles transmit footage to the servers on the ship, so they were able to live stream the dive up until they lost contact.” He slid a tablet over to me. A video was queued up. I hit play and couldn’t make out much. It was clearly dive footage. A vast blackness with particles floating across the screen as the camera descended. The footage went static briefly then cut back. The depth gauge on the display kept increasing: 9000ft, 9100ft… I fast forwarded a few seconds to where the screen began to focus. The gauge read 15,000ft. The static was cutting in and out and the video was almost unwatchable. A toppled over house came into frame, littered with debris nearby. Wedged into the cliffside was another half standing home. I gasped as a mannequin floated close to the camera, quickly in and then out of frame. In the corner of the screen a sliver of an elongated silhouette flashed by and then the camera feed cut. 

“They found the town? Underwater? How?” I was filled with questions. “Listen, I’ve already said far more than I should have.” Captain Downes said. “I called you because the higher ups are having me put together a group to investigate this. The research vessel is still out there. Commandeered for the past few days by the coast guard under the guise of pirate activity in the area. It’s a big ordeal, and the less you know for now the better. All you need to know is that you’ll be in charge of the Project’s research efforts, and aid in any other capacity I might need a number two for. There’s a reason I called you. The first and most important is that whatever we find, if substantial, is part of an already big cover-up, and my guess is it will continue. You’re my failsafe. If this goes south, the world needs to know about what’s going on. Next one is pretty simple. You and I had each others backs when it mattered during those life or death situations overseas.” I flinched. I try hard not to think about my first tour. 

“That’s a kind of trust that doesn’t break.” He said, almost reassuringly. “Plus I don’t think the paycheck is all that bad.” He typed something into his phone and I got a direct deposit notification that was well over the entire amount of my savings thus far. I wish it hadn’t at the time, but that was more than enough to convince me. 

…

I’m going to end the post here. I was going to go into the first journal entry but after writing down everything and looking back over it… Well it’s a lot. I’ll post once our plane lands back in the United States and I’m back home. Jack and I agreed to meet later tomorrow after getting a good nights rest. It took a lot to convince him and I’m going to use the last hour of this flight to continue to do so…
