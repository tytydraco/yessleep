[Y’all read my posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1blj28l/how_to_survive_college_i_am_the_architect_of_my/) for the monsters and instead you get me talking about my relationships.  If you can’t handle it, just skip down about halfway.

Otherwise, it’s time for everyone’s favorite drama: dAtInG dRaMa but also we’re talking about our lives together after graduation and there’s some really serious family problems mixed in too.

I’m bad at replying, but I *do* read the comments and think about the advice you’re giving me.  I know I should be making my own decisions here instead of relying on all of you, because I’m my own person and this is my life to live.  Right?  But I’m not sure how much of *me* I can trust.

Because I didn’t ask Grayson about his dad.  I didn’t even *remember* what happened with his dad until I went to post this and was checking up on where I left off with the last post.  I’ve since texted Grayson we need to have another talk, about both his dad and another issue that’s come up, but I wanted to type all this out in case talking to Grayson is the trigger that causes the Forgetter (shut up I’m naming it because idgaf) to go after me.  I’m pretty sure that’s what happened, because that’s the most obvious entity that makes people straight up forget things around here.

I’m trying not to dwell on the whole ‘forgetting parts of my life’ thing.  Cassie seems to be handling it well.  I’m sure I’ll be juuuust fine when I finally decide to come to terms with this.  Either way, it’s a problem for Future Ashley.  She can deal with it along with all the other problems I’ve decided she can handle.

Future Ashley is going to be so pissed at me.

Anyway, opinions on what to do with Grayson were mixed.  I am similarly just as confused.  I can’t trust him, but also he needs support and help at this time.  Both of those are true, really.  Talking this out with Cassie and Maria wasn’t much help, either.  Cassie is firmly set on I need a bit of distance until I figure out what’s happening, and I suspect some of that is based in her own feelings towards the inhuman.  She doesn’t remember her former roommate, but she remembers all the fear and uncertainty she felt the previous year and it has affected her.  She’s afraid of losing someone else and is worried something will happen to me if I’m close to Grayson.

I’m not inferring, she straight up told me this.

Maria is well, Maria.  While she’s a lot more careful this year, she still has a bit of that naive invincibility lingering around and thinks that we can handle whatever is happening with Grayson’s dad.  She thinks that not only should I continue to support him but I should also bring her and Cassie into it so that all three of us can help him deal with these problems.  We’ve been working through things pretty well already, haven’t we?

I didn’t have the heart to tell her all the shit I’ve gotten myself into without them.

She also said that if I wasn’t sure about a romantic relationship right now, considering how serious of a problem we’re facing, then maybe just focus on building the friendship and re-evaluate later.  Maria is very much of the mindset that she has all the time in the world to find someone and get married, which is kind of weird for me to watch, considering I come from a town where most people marry their highschool sweethearts, often directly after highschool.

In the end, I decided to just tell Grayson everything about how I was feeling and maybe we could figure out what we wanted our relationship to be or if we needed to take a step back for a little bit and deal with bigger problems.  The conversation started normally enough.  We were both dealing with some pretty serious shit, I said, with him graduating and now knowing what to do afterwards and me dealing with - and here I paused.

What *was* I dealing with?

Everything that happened last year, it turned out.  And I finally crumbled.

Listen.  I’m not strong.  I’m not the competent and confident person I need to be.  I’ve been putting on a good front for a while now but honestly so much of this is an act, so much of this has just been pretend because maybe if I pretend hard enough I’ll become that person.  But I’m not.  It’s not working.  I’m not okay.

I regret killing the flickering man.

Campus is falling apart.  *I’m* falling apart.  Blah blah blah I’m not responsible for other people but the things I *am* responsible for feel like too much.  I killed the flickering man.  I did that.  I’m the reason everything is spiraling out of control on campus and why the creatures are acting weird and why there’s roots *everywhere*.  And what’s more, I can’t even say I did it for the right reason.  At least when I went after the eyeball I was righting a wrong.  This was… I just…

I felt like I had to be this person I’m not.

And I’m collapsing under the pressure.

I feel like such an ass now.  I dumped all of this on Grayson when this conversation was supposed to be about what was happening with his dad and how we could deal with that and support him.  Instead, he ended up having to comfort *me* and my seemingly endless litany of *problems* because I apparently can’t get my life together.  I’m not entirely certain what all was said after that.  I was pretty emotional.  But I do remember the conversation at the end, when we kinda-sorta-broke up?

“I’m not very good at relationships,” he said.  “I care about you, I want you in my life - but if this is *hurting* you -”

“Do you think we need to break up?” I sniveled.

He hesitated.

“Do we really need a *dating* relationship?” he finally said.  “Like - boyfriend and girlfriend and all those expectations that come with it?  Sometimes I feel like I’m putting on an act.  And… sometimes I feel you’re putting on an act too.  Can’t we just… be together without that?”

It’s weird.  I think we just mutually agreed to be friends but I feel so *relieved*.  I just thought that, I don’t know, Grayson was kind to me and it just felt like this was how it was supposed to go.  We were dating because that was the obvious, expected next step.  It’s like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders now that I don’t have to worry about whether I’m being a good girlfriend or not.  I don’t think I know what it means to be a good girlfriend.  But I’m getting the hang of being a good friend, so that’s what I’ll do for a while and then we’ll just see what happens.

If you skipped all that to get to this part, I don’t blame you.  I’m finding it exhausting and I’m the one living it.

To that end, after the talk with Grayson I was spending some time holed up in my room, desperately trying to ignore everything going on around me and focus on my schoolwork.  That’s at least nice and predictable.  Cassie wasn’t home, which meant when the door to my bedroom flew open, I was entirely not expecting it.

Naturally, I leapt into action, and by that I mean I fell out of my chair and lay on the floor, frozen in shock, staring up in mute disbelief and confusion at the devil.

Yes.  *Him*.  Standing there in my doorway, one hand on the door which he’d dramatically flung open, posing proudly with the self-importance of someone here to deliberately ruin my entire day.

If I’m being logical about it, I suppose I’m lucky I got the trickster stand-in version of the devil.  It’s… not much fun for me, though, which is kind of how it goes with the tricksters.

“I don’t recall giving you permission to enter my room at any time,” I finally said, once my heart rate was back down to something more reasonable.

I want to add that he hadn’t moved in that entire time.  He was still standing there with one hand on the door, as if frozen in time until I recovered from my shock enough to appreciate his entrance.  He finally let go of the door and leaned on the frame instead, crossing his lanky arms and hooking his thumbs in his suspenders.

“It was in the contract you signed,” he replied smugly.

“I didn’t sign anything!”

“Exactly.”

I just… what?  Does that make *any* sense to anyone else, because it sure sounds like a load of bullshit to me.

“Anyway,” he continued, “I’m just here to tell you that Maria is on her way here to ask a favor of you that you’re not going to like.  I am 99.9repeating% certain that you’re going to accept because you haven’t gotten over feeling like everything is your responsibility, but I just want to add that last infinite decimal point of certainty to the equation.”

“I-I don’t know if that’s how repeating decimal point math works.”

“I don’t know either.  But if you do it, I’ll give you a reward.”

There was an evil glint to his eye and one corner of his mouth crooked up in a smile.

“Honestly this makes me less willing to do it,” I said.  “Nothing you involve me in goes well.”

“I’m offended!  I’ve been such a good ally.  Didn’t I punch someone for you?”

“Can we not talk about that?”

His eyes narrowed and the other side of his mouth quirked up to complete the thin, sinister smile.

“Oh right,” he murmured.  “*Trauma.*  But I’m glad you realize my gifts have an edge to them.  You’re still going to do this.  And then you’re going to take what I have to give you.”

There was a knock at the door.  Maria was here.  I scrambled to my feet, but the devil was way ahead of me.  He reached the door before I even made it out of the bedroom and opened the door for her.

Sort of.  Her hand was on the doorknob as if she was opening it herself, but he gently eased it open in time with her to step through the doorway.  Then he tucked himself behind the open door and smiled at me as she waltzed right past him, oblivious to the fact that someone else had acted on the door and that anyone other than me was in the room.  He slipped outside behind her and eased the door shut, waving at me in the last second before the door shut behind him.

Maria had no idea any of this happened.  She was already launching into the problem the devil was so keen on me solving.

“The thing in the hallway,” Maria said breathlessly.  “It ate someone.  One of the Folklore Society members saw it happen.”

It felt like I’d been punched in the gut.  It was hard to register what Maria was saying.  They were talking about it in their meeting - which was still going on.  They were panicking.  She’d told them that she’d go get someone that might be able to help.

Me.

“They were looking at your list of rules,” she said.  “I think you can calm them down.”

I was shaking my head frantically.  Hadn’t I done enough for them?  Why was everyone on all sides pushing me into this again?

“I don’t want to do this,” I said, my chest tightening.  “I don’t want to get involved with them again.”

“I don’t either!” she yelled.  Then she took a deep breath and visibly tried to calm down.  “I’m sorry.  I get it.  I don’t want to be there either - I feel responsible for what happened too.  But they’re freaking out and I think they’re going to do something reckless. One of them was, uh, talking about driving home and getting a gun out of their parent’s gun case.”

“That… that’s probably not going to work.”

“I know!”  She stared at me, her eyes wide and I realized that she was as scared as I was.  “Please.  Just come talk with them for a little bit.”

Just talk to them.  So deceptively simple.  If I was naive, maybe I could convince myself that this was the favor that the devil was referring to.  That I’d just go and share my wisdom and experience and that would be all.

Hah.  We all know that’s not how it works.  If I went, I’d be *involved*.

“Fine,” I said quietly.  “Let me get my umbrella.  Just in case it rains.”

The Folklore Society members were sitting around in morose silence when we arrived.  They’d tried calling campus security while Maria was gone, with predictable results.  It was like the person they’d talked to couldn’t comprehend the words the caller was saying.  Like they were having two completely different conversations.  After relating this, they all turned their attention to me.  It was a small group, at least.  Only five people.  I’m not sure if they were all present in the graveyard, because I’m not great with faces.  I did recognize the club president, at least.

“Is there *anyone* we can go to for help?” he asked, once we were done rehashing what happened.

I could think of a few people.  Grayson.  The devil.  I wasn’t going to share any of these names with the club, however.

“The school isn’t going to help us,” I said.  “They’re okay with the status quo.  That’s why we created a list of rules.”

“Except the thing in the hallway wasn’t following them,” one of the other students said in a soft voice.

She was the one that saw it happen.  It occurred yesterday morning.  She tried to talk to the other students in the class, but when she realized that they had no idea that anything had happened or that they were missing a classmate, she began to wonder if perhaps it was *her* that was seeing things.  Then she went to the folklore society meeting, said something about a creature in the hallway, and someone pulled out *my* list of rules.

And it all came apart after that.  She told them everything.  They believed her.  And then Maria felt compelled to stay behind with the small group that was trying to figure out what to do.

I hadn’t been given all of the details yet, however.  When she’d said that she was in the classroom and someone was taken by the thing in the hallway, I figured it happened exactly the same as what I saw.  Except… it hadn’t.

It had reached *into* the classroom, she said.  She heard it sliding down the corridor and then the door creaked open and a single claw like a scythe had reached inside and… impaled the closest student.  Dragged him out.  He was screaming, clawing at the floor, the doorframe, and no one seemed to hear him.

“There was a trail of blood leading out into the hallway!” she sobbed.  “I don’t know why no one else noticed.”

Okay.  This was new.  My stomach was twisting itself into knots.  It was obvious what was happening here.  With the flickering man gone, the thing in the hallway was going to help itself to a little snacky-snack whenever it felt like.  I wanted to throw up.

“I kind of wonder if the bloodstains got cleaned up,” Maria said.

That was all it took.  I mouthed ‘not helping’ at her, but it was far too late.  Everyone else wanted to see if the bloodstains were gone too, because if they weren’t, then it was confirmation that everything had happened as described.  And if they were, then it was confirmation that the campus was covering all of this up.  The girl that saw the student get taken refused to come with us.  It was bad enough that she was going to have to keep going to that class, she said.  But the rest of the small group was willing to go look.

“It’s dangerous if that thing isn’t following the rules,” I said.  I felt obligated to point it out.

“It’s dangerous for *everyone* right now, it seems like,” the president countered.  “If we can get a photo of those bloodstains, then maybe we can force the administration to do something.”

It felt more like he was unconvinced of the story and wanted the evidence in front of his face.  Regardless, I could see where this was going.  They were going to go investigate no matter what I said.  Reluctantly, I agreed to go with them.  I wanted to keep an eye on Maria.  Besides, I rationalized as we walked over as a group to the English building, the creature didn’t have to feed that often.  I found that out last year.  If it’d just eaten, then we would hopefully be safe.

The classroom in question was on the second floor.  There weren’t many classes in session at the moment, so the hallway was quiet save for a distant murmur of a voice speaking from behind a windowed wall.  We clustered around the classroom door, staring at the floor.  While not exactly clean, it was still devoid of bloodstains.

“Maybe we got the room wrong,” someone suggested.

I was quietly standing a short distance apart from the group.  Or maybe the bloodstains only showed up when someone was in that halfway between space.  It felt like I was moving in slow motion.  I raised my head and stared off through the frosted windows of another classroom.  I could smell the rain in the air.  I tasted it in my mouth, sucking the moisture between my teeth with every breath.

It was starting to rain.  Of course.  Like it knew the absolute worst time for us.

The lights flickered.  Somewhere in the building, a door banged open with enough force to rattle the windows.  Everyone’s head shot up and they stared down the long corridor.  I could see in how their faces turned pale that they finally saw what I was seeing.

Bloodstains.  Layer upon layer of dried blood, built up over the years down the length of the hallway, like a rust-red river underneath our feet.

“We need to get out of here,” I said evenly.

Run?  No.  The door that opened sounded like it was between us and the exit, as someone quickly pointed out.  The club president grabbed the classroom door handle, clearly intending to have us hide in there until it passed.

“No!,” Maria snapped.  “Somewhere without windows!  Let’s try that.  It won’t know we’re there.”

It seemed like a reasonable enough plan to our panic-addled brains.  As a group, we ran down the hallway to the most obvious windowless room in the building.

The bathroom.

And because Maria was in the lead and picked on instinct, we all wound up in the ladies restroom.  She threw the door open and we all tumbled through, heading for the far wall as Maria quietly eased the door shut, letting it fall closed without a sound.  Then we huddled in a corner of the bathroom, as far away from the door as we could get.  None of us looked at each other.  We stared either at the door at the floor, our hands clasped over our mouths, each of us lost in our own private terror.  For on the other side of the door, we could hear the sliding, rasping sound of the creature making its ponderous way past our hiding spot.

There was another sound that I didn’t immediately recognize.  One that I hadn’t heard in my previous encounters with the thing in the hallway… at least, one I didn’t hear with its approach.  A sharp, intermittent cracking noise.

The sound dwindled.  Overhead, the lights stabilized.  After a long moment of silence, the president volunteered to check the hallway and make sure it was safe to leave.

“D-did anyone get a photo of the bloodstains?” someone asked.

Friends, I think you know what the answer to that is.  Of course no one did.  They all know beyond a doubt that the thing in the hallway is real, but no one has any evidence to compel the administration to do something about it.  The president made a half-hearted suggestion that they could look through the library’s resources and see what they could find about a creature like this, but I already knew they wouldn’t find anything.  The things that live here on campus aren’t creatures found in folklore.

But it would keep them busy for a little while, so I didn’t say anything. I think if I’d told them everything I’d noticed while we were hiding in that bathroom they wouldn’t be content with merely researching the creature.  They would do something reckless.  I know they would.

That noise. The wet smacking of something chewing and the crunching and cracking of bones breaking.

And the whimpering.  The whimpering that didn’t come from any of us.  The whimpering that came from beyond the bathroom door.  That wet, helpless noise of someone dying with no hope of salvation.

Either the thing in the hallway has found a new victim already… or it’s still chewing on [its](https://alderrayne.com/) [last](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/).
