I was always a good looking guy.  
Good eyes, jawline, abs, things of that nature.  
However, I've also always been helplessly awkward around women for whatever reason.  
After a lot of thinking and many times during family  dinners my dad drunkly demanded me to bang a woman already,  I decided to grudgingly install Tinder.   
  
I already had some exprience with texting women online, so it was the same usual crap that made me not want to install tinder in the first place:  
1)I text a girl.  
2)she takes hours to reply because she wants to seem like she's so cool and busy and because she frankly doesn't give a fuck about me.  
3)I do the same.  
4)I say some silly jokes so she likes me like I'm some fucking clown.  
5)I then ask to meet up.  
6)she ghosts me.  
7)on to the next girl.  
  
This frustrating pattern went on with 3 girls until I finally texted a girl who i thought was nicer.  
This girl, Casey, actually seemed to be interested. She said I'm funny, and handsome and that she'd love to meet up.  
I was very intimacy deprived, so that was enough to completely turn off any sort of rationale I had.  
Looking back, I should've been wiser.  
  
She proposed to meet at a park that was suspiciously right next to my house.  
She knew where I lived.  
Again, I was too horny to notice this.  
  
  
We meet up and start talking.  
As we talk, even my extremely thirsty ass notices...  
It's just \*too\* easy.  
She laughs at every dumb joke I make. She compliments me a lot. She's the one to initiate touch...  
Almost like... I'm where she wants me to me and she wants me to stay there...  
The more we talk, the more I notice her laugh seems... forced.  
Again, like she's  just using it to lure me in.  
At one point, even my horny ass began feeling uncomfortable and it started getting late.  
I hugged her and said goodbye.  
I was then stopped.  
I felt a sharp, burning sudden pain in my arm.   
I sighed and turned around cautiously, knowing it'll be an unpleasant sight.   
Turns out, it wasn't an unpleasant sight.  
It was much worse than that.  
Her hand was now covered in blood as her nails dug deeper and deeper into my forearm.  
I gasped and tried to release myself, only for her grip to strengthen.  
My eyes then traveled from her hand to her face.  
Her face was contorted in horror; her lips were pursed tightly and her forehead was scrunched, her eyes were wide and her pupils were so dilated that they were almost completely black. Her bottom lip trembled and a stray tear rolled down her cheek.  


"u-um... why are you sca-"  


She cuts me off

"Please," she whispered, her voice trembled as she forced out the words, "Don't go. I don't want to do this."

"Do what...?" I cautiously ask  


"...please just come with me. p-please..." she answers, her voice very shaken.  


I barely knew this woman. She showed a ton of red flags and this just escalated significantly.  
Although it created much guilt in me, I decided to run away.  


"COME BACK, PLEASE!!!" She screamed, her voice became so hoarse from her desperate screaming it hurt to hear her...  


Eventually, I arrive back home.  


I think to myself "Finally some peac-"  
I feel some liquid drip on my nose from the ceiling.  
I turn on the light and look up.  
My eyes widen.  
I swiftly run to bathroom and vomit for what seems like hours from the grotesque sight I've just witnessed.  
I return to the room and stare at Casey's corpse.  
It was such a grotesque sight that I won't even attempt to describe it, as I think there's such a thing as "too much".   
But to give you some idea of what happened to her, let's just say... she had very beautiful and clear skin... I wonder where it went...

I kept staring at her body as it hung lifelessly from the ceiling.   
I then remembered something she said at the start of the date...  
"I would panic if you didn't come hehe..."
