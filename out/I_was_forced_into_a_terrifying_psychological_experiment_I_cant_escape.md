I am writing this to you from a school-issued computer I hacked. The past few days have been surreal.

It all started the first day of 6th grade. There was no sense that anything was wrong, just the crisp late summer air. If anyone knew what would happen, they were doing a great job covering it up. Students from preschool to eighth grade were catching up with friends, renewing rivalries, and a slight sense of dread hanged in the air. I climbed up the stairs to the second floor and entered my new classroom. My homeroom teacher was a relatively nice woman named Mrs. Combs, whom I'd had for math last year. I found my seat (next to an annoying boy, no surprise) and eyed the door for my fellow students. Groups of students walked in the door, each seemingly more energetic than the last. Once everyone was settled, my teacher began the boring lecture we always listen to at the beginning of the year about all the rules. I was in my own world, thinking about stories, murder mysteries, fantasy epics, and everything in between. That's when the weird started to happen.

I heard 4 knocks on the door (bold, I know) and Mrs. Combs let them in. They were middle aged men in black suits with nametags. "What are you here for?" I remember Mrs. Combs asking. "Them." They replied, motioning to us.

All of us.

"You can't have them," Mrs. Combs started, "They're kids, you must have the wrong people." "I know we don't." The rest was a blur of screaming, kicking, and lunging. I must've tried to fight back, because one of them injected a serum into my brain.

I woke up in what seemed to be a truck, sharing the trunk with the same kid who I was sitting next to in class, named Agastya. "Hi." He said casually, as if we were randomly coming across each other in the street and not stuffed in the back of a truck. I replied with the first thing I could think of. "What happened?" I was a long story, so I'll shorten it for you. According to him, there was lots more fighting and yelling, until finally us kids got worn out and they loaded us into the trucks. I guess they were lazy, so they organized us according to Mrs. Combs' seating arrangements. No one knew where we were going, and it didn't seem like Mrs. Combs knew either. The rest of the long ride was pretty quiet, except for the occasional "Scared?" or the "What do you think's going to happen?" We finally got led out.

I saw what seemed to be a military base, with the flat, gray box of a building and barbed wire surrounding it. I think we were in the desert. Armed guards led us through the gates and inside, threatening to shoot if we metaphorically or literally stepped out of line. The inside of the building was just as drab as the outside. Gray walls surrounded us on all four sides. A man came out of another shadowy room. He was large and had a tough face, like a drill sergeant. "HEEELLLOOO!" He said a little too loudly and happily. Some kids were angry, some concerned, some confused, all scared. "I SEEE YOUVE ARRIVED> LEEEEEEET ME SHOWWWWW YOUUUU THE RULESSSSSS!" he said while unfolding a long piece of paper.

*Comply to all demands*

*Never fight back*

"DOOOO NOT BREEAAAK AAANNNYYYY OFFFF THE RULLES. YOU WILLLLL FACE SEEERRRIOOOUSSS CONSEQUUUENNCESSSSS." The man said, motioning to the armed men.

"DORRRRM ASSSSSIGNNNMENTSSSS! LUUUCASSSS, SAAAAAMMM, YUUUUSUUFFF, DAAAANNNYY, JACCCCKKKKSONNN, BOY'S DORRRRMMMM A. A group of guards led them away from the rest of us. "SSSSAAAIII, AAAGAAASSSTTYYYYAAAA, REEEEIIIIII, BRRYYAAANNN, JAAAYYYYDEEENNN, BOY'S DORRRRMMMMM B." Another group of guards led those boys out, and the head man (I had named him Mr. Rage) continued with these assignments into the girl's dorms. More and more kids left, until only 5 of us girls remained. Mr. Rage confirmed that we were sleeping together. "SSSOOOOPPHHHIIIIAAAA, AANNNAAAA, AAAUUUUDDRREEEEYY, VIVVVIANNAAAAA GGGGRRRRRAAAAACCEEEE, GIRL'S DDOOOORRRRMMM C." The last group of guards led us down the hallway. It was narrow and dark, but we made it through. We ended up in a room with 3 bunk beds. "Sophia, Anna, you're in bunk 1." One of the guards barked. "Audrey, Viviana, bunk 2. Grace, bunk 3. All of you must change now." He led us further down the hall to the bathroom. One bathroom. For more than 30 kids. There was already a long line, since we were the last group called. After lots of waiting, it was finally my turn to go in. It was old, outhouse quality. I managed to take my clothes off and go number one. I put on the uniform. It was white, not calming white, but more of a sterile white, like you would see on a lab coat. I exited the bathroom. The only person after me was Viviana. We all waited for her to come out. "OHHH-KAY!" Mr. Rage shouted. "Time for lunch." The guards took us to what seemed to be the cafeteria, with many tables. The guards told us to get into the lunch line. The cafeteria workers gave us a few crackers and some sludge. "THIS is lunch?!?" Danny exclaimed. He made a mistake. Mr. Rage seemed angrier than usual. I managed to force down the sludge. I was ready to puke.

Five minutes later, Mr. Rage shouted again. "TIIIIIME FOR CLASSSS!" The guards forced us into a room with many desks. Computers lined the desks. "You will be tested on your academic skills. You will receive personalized lesson plans based on this. STAAARRRT!" I tried to scramble what little algebra I could remember after today's chaos, but Mr. Rage soon came back. "TIIIIIMEEEE FOOOOOOR SACRIIIIIIIFICE!" 

Sacrifice?

They pushed us down the stairs to a basement and put us into glass capsules alphabetically. The capsule doors locked behind me, and I was alone. Soon, the platform under my feet rose. CLIK CA CHUNK CA CHUNK CA CLIK CHUNK. The platform made some more of those noises, until finally, I saw my fellow students in capsules in a circle around another, gigantic gray platform in the middle. Mr. Rage was in a glass box in the ceiling. "MIIISTERR LIIIIIOOOONEEEEELLLLL WIIIIILLLLLL GREEEETTTT YOOUUU!" Mister Lionel? What seemed to be Mr. Lionel emerged from behind Mr. Rage. He was skinny, young, and had narrow, scary eyes. He looked like the human version of a snake. "Hello, children." He said calmly, devoid of emotion. "It is time to vote. Each of you will receive a small piece of paper and a pen. You will write the name of the person in your class you want dead on the paper."

Dead?

"I will take the papers back from you when you finish. The person with the most votes will face a gruesome death tomorrow. Papers." Mr. Rage pulled a lever up in the box at this command. Each of us received a paper and pen. Strategically, I should want the person who hates me most to be dead, so I have a lesser chance at getting voted out if we continue to do this later. "Time."  I quickly wrote Danny's name on the paper, since he's my worst enemy in the class. Mr. Rage pressed a button, and a vacuum appeared over my head, sucking up my pen, paper, and some of my hair. "Oh, and one more thing." Mr. Lionel added. "You children cannot speak, or it's automatic death for you."

Today's the next day. I didn't have a good night's rest, but quite the opposite. My night was full of nightmares, mostly of me trying to escape but getting held by the leg by Mr. Lionel. Last night's dinner, today's breakfast, and today's lunch were just as awful as yesterday's lunch. I am writing to you during today's class period, since I figured out how to hack the computer. I have tried dreaming up ways to escape, but the guards and electric fence will stop me before I even breathe in fresh air. If anyone has any ideas on how to escape, get revenge, or just not die, I'd love to hear it. I'll check back in with you tomorrow.
