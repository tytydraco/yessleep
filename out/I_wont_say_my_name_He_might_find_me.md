(What I’m about to tell you is real. If I disappear, now you know why.)

Hi.
My name is… well, I shouldn’t say it.
Saying it out loud might be enough for him to find me.

It feels strange writing this.
I’ve spent my entire life running from something I can’t explain.
Something I did when I was just a kid—
something that changed my family’s fate… and mine.
Something that is now, as the deadline approaches, ready to collect its price.

⸻

It all began with a stare from outside my bedroom door

I was around twelve or thirteen, living with my parents.
Every single night, without fail, I felt someone standing outside my room.
A cold, heavy, unmoving presence.

I never heard footsteps.
Never heard breathing.
Just… eyes.
Eyes that pushed through the darkness and into my skull.

I barely slept.
One or two hours at most.
The rest of the night I lay awake, trembling, waiting for that thing to come in.

And my home wasn’t safe either.

My dad drank too much.
He yelled at us, hit us if something wasn’t clean.
My mom cried almost every night.
Fights, slammed doors, broken things—

And always, outside my room,
his eyes.
Patient.
Heavy.
Hungry.

I was just a kid.
There was nothing I could do.

⸻

When my grandfather got sick, everything got worse

My mom’s father suddenly became very ill.
His strength drained away like something was feeding on him.

My uncle—her brother and a severe drug addict—lived in the same house.
He treated my mom like a servant.
She came home every day in tears, exhausted and helpless.

For the first time in years, my parents began working together, trying to survive the misery.

But I… I was drowning in nightmares.
Nightmares where the thing outside my door walked into my room.
Where it touched my face with hands made of smoke.

And one night, for the first time, it spoke clearly:

“Offer her to me. I will make your dreams come true.”

I didn’t understand.
I didn’t know who it wanted.

But the words got stuck inside me like a hook.

⸻

The “game” that wasn’t a game

One afternoon at school, a classmate showed us a website that supposedly let you “contact demons.”
This was years before AI.

We entered it.
We asked simple questions:

“What’s my name?”
“Who’s next to me?”

It answered everything correctly.

We laughed—
until the letters typed themselves out on the screen:

“Your soul is a good price.”

A cold shiver stabbed straight through my spine.
I left the classroom without saying a word.

⸻

The pact

That night, my mom came home crying.
My uncle, high out of his mind, had urinated and defecated right in front of my dying grandfather’s bed.
The stress made his condition worse.
They rushed him to the hospital.

While my mom cried in the living room, the thing appeared at my door.

And it smiled.

That was the moment I understood:
my soul was what it wanted.

I barely slept an hour.
At dawn, I was broken.
I looked up rituals online—
ways to sell your soul.
None of them seemed real.

But that night, the thing walked to the kitchen without looking at me.
Like it wanted me to follow.

I did.

It was standing there, unmoving, a dark mass that breathed.
On the table beside it lay a shiny kitchen knife.

And a thought—
not mine—
slipped into my mind:

Cut your hand.
Press it to your chest.
Tell him it’s his.
Promise that no one around you will ever suffer again.

I obeyed.

I cut myself.
Pressed my bloody hand to my chest.
Spoke the words it wanted.

And everything changed.

⸻

The price started the next morning

I woke up with no wound.
No blood.
No pain.
I thought I had imagined it.

But when I went to the kitchen, my mom told me:

“Your grandfather died last night.”

She was strangely calm.
Relieved, even.
For the first time in years.

My parents began getting along.
My siblings seemed happier.
My girlfriend loved me more.

Everything got better for them.

But for me…

Everything went black.

⸻

Hell came to collect what it was owed

My girlfriend cheated on me—
with my best friends.

People at school kept trying to fight me.
I got sick.
Then sicker.
Nightmares replaced sleep entirely.

Whenever I tried to pray…
my body rebelled.

After going to church, my legs seized up.
I couldn’t walk for days.
When I tried to say the Lord’s Prayer, I vomited blood.

He didn’t want competition.

And every night, when I closed my eyes,
he was there.

Smiling.
Watching.
Closer every time.

⸻

As an adult, I tried running

I moved far away.
Cut my family off to protect them.
He stopped appearing physically.

But my life became poisoned.

Accidents.
Illness.
Loss.
Betrayal.
Money disappearing.
Opportunities failing at the last second.

Everything I touch falls apart.

And sometimes, in the corner of my eye,
I still see that smile.

⸻

The deadline

There’s something I never said.

Something I heard in my head the night I made the pact:

“When you turn 30, I will come for your soul.”

But there was a clause:

He cannot kill me.
I must reach 30 alive so he can take what’s his.

If I die before then,
I don’t know what happens.

But if I reach that age…

I don’t want to imagine it.

I don’t want to write it.

I don’t want to know.

⸻

Why I’m posting this

Because I have only a few months left.
Because maybe someone has been through something similar.
Because maybe someone knows what to do.

Because I don’t sleep anymore.
I barely eat.
I barely exist.

And when I close my eyes,
I see his smile—
the same one from the night I gave away the only thing that was truly mine.

My soul.
My identity.
My end.

⸻

**I won’t say my name.

Because if I do,
he will hear it.**

And he will come to collect.
