Hello everyone, My name is Henry, I’m a 78 years old retired Park ranger in Colorado. I’ve had many stories from the silly ones to borderline horror movie shit. Today I’ll be telling you about the stories that still haunt me to this day. Let’s start with my first weird story, I called it “Hell Deer”

When I was 23 My friend Carl and I received a report about a sighting of a grizzly bear. We spare no time and rush straight through the area, Grizzlies are a big problem because well, they’re fuckin’ bears. As we got closer to the area we began to smell something nasty. “Ugh, what the fuck is this smell..” Carl said while covering his nose. The smell is fucking god-awful It’s probably one of the worst things I’ve ever smelled in my whole damn life.  But that ain't gonna stop us because people’s safety comes first and bears especially grizzlies are some dangerous shit. 

After a while of walking, we finally got to the area that has been reported of grizzly bear sighting. And oh boy… What we found was not a bear. Well, it is, but it’s dead. Rotting. We walked for hours just to find a dead bear. I thought this was a waste of time until Carl noticed something. “What the fuck? Is that a deer?” Carl said while pointing at a deer. What we saw was well, a deer. Except it’s… it’s eating the bear. I’ve never seen a deer eating a beer before, let alone meat. I was shocked. I instinctively pulled out my gun and aimed at the deer ready to shoot anytime it made a move.

The deer slowly raises its bloody head. Staring at us dead in the eyes. An empty eyes with no thoughts behind them. Then it screamed. It fucking screamed. Before we could do anything the deer came running straight at us. Carl managed to dodge it But I’m not lucky like him. It pinned me down to the ground. It screamed straight into my face, I could smell the horrid stench of rotting flesh and blood. Before it could do anything, Carl pulls out his trusty shotgun and yelled “GET OFF HIM YOU FUCKING HELL DEER” and blows up its head. It collapsed next to me, lifeless. While Carl helped me get up.

We called the others and I was hospitalized. During that time there were many things I’ve been wondering about.  What the fuck just happened? Why is a deer eating a bear? **What killed the Bear?** and I got the answer for well, one of them. Carl came to visit me and showed me the result of the autopsy. It was the deer. The deer killed the bear. The autopsy shows punctured wounds with pieces of broken antlers. I was shocked. But that’s not all. What Carl said next is even more shocking.

“The Deer. It was long dead.”

And that's the story for today. Tell me if you want more of these stories because I have a bunch of them and this story is just the beginning.
Thank you for reading!!!
