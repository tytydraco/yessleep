I took a seasonal ranger job in the Cascades.

Mostly isolation stuff—watching fire lines, logging trail damage, monitoring wildlife. A few radio check-ins a day and the rest of the time was mine. Perfect gig for someone trying to get away.

The cabin I was assigned sits about twelve miles from the nearest road. Old place, nothing fancy. Radio tower. Generator. Propane stove. No internet. No cell service.

Just me, the trees, and a whole lot of quiet.

I liked it.

Until the third week.

That’s when the noises started.

Not animals. Not weather.

Footsteps.

They were subtle at first. Slow. Heavy. Always at night. I’d hear them circling the cabin—four or five paces at a time—then nothing for hours.

I set up trail cams. Eight of them. Motion-triggered. Infrared. I nailed them to trees in a perimeter pattern.

The next morning, I found all eight on the ground.

Not broken. Not chewed.

Just unscrewed from the trees and placed neatly in a pile beside the front steps.

Like a message.

Like a warning.

I put them back up.

Two days later, they were closer.

Three of them had been moved. Not far. Just ten feet in. Angled toward the windows now.

I didn’t sleep that night.

I brought the cams inside that morning. Locked the door behind me. Double-checked the windows.

Each camera had about five hours of footage. Mostly empty woods. The occasional raccoon. Branches swaying in the wind.

But then I got to the fifth one.

Timestamp: 2:13 AM.

Movement.

The camera jolts slightly, like someone’s adjusting it. Then it re-angles itself — pointing not at the trail, but at the cabin window. Mine. The one facing my bed.

It sat still for two full minutes.

Then something stepped into frame.

Not all at once.

Just a shoulder, then a leg — long, thin, but covered in something dark and matted like wet bark or hair.

It moved slow.

Too slow.

Like it didn’t care if it was seen.

Then it turned.

Just its head.

And I swear to God, it looked at the camera. Right at it.

Then—frame by frame—it smiled.

Not human.

Not animal.

Just a jagged split of dark between fur.

And behind it?

Another face.

Smaller.

Pressed against the glass of the cabin window.

Looking in.

I packed within ten minutes.

Clothes. Knife. Batteries. Radio.

I didn’t even turn the generator off.

I just left.

I took the west trail—steeper, but faster. It runs past three old fire lookouts and hits the service road at mile twelve. From there, it’s a five-mile descent to where I parked the truck.

I made it three miles before I realized I wasn’t alone.

It wasn’t footsteps.

It was the silence.

Birds, insects, even wind—gone. Like the forest had sucked in a breath and was holding it.

That’s when I saw the first cairn.

Stacked stones. Six of them. Carefully balanced in the middle of the trail.

Nothing odd on its own.

Except there was a scrap of red flannel tucked beneath the top stone.

I didn’t own anything red.

A mile later, I saw another.

This one had a tooth resting on top.

Human.

I kept moving. Didn’t stop to breathe. Just head down, keep walking, keep walking, keep walking—

Until I looked up and saw the cabin.

My cabin.

The same stack of cameras in a pile by the steps.

Same dent in the railing from when I slipped hauling wood last week.

I’d walked for five hours in one direction.

And somehow, I’d come back.

There were fresh footprints on the porch.

But only one set.

Mine.

I didn’t go inside.

I just sat on the porch, staring at the footprints. Same tread pattern. Same width. Same weight distribution.

Mine.

But I don’t remember walking in circles.

I don’t remember coming back.

I checked my phone. The timestamp said 3:08 PM.

Then 3:08 PM again.

Then 3:07.

I checked the radio. Dead. No static. Just that same low hum, like a throat clearing on the other end of the line.

I stayed outside until dusk.

Didn’t eat. Didn’t move.

When the first shadow passed between the trees, I almost didn’t see it. It didn’t move like anything should. Didn’t step or glide. It just shifted—like something flickering between places.

I backed toward the door.

The handle was warm.

Inside, everything was where I left it. Bags still packed. Flashlight on the floor. Window cracked open, just a bit.

And something new.

A photo.

Resting in the center of the bed.

It was old. Weathered. Black-and-white.

Five men in ranger uniforms. Cabin in the background.

All of them smiling.

All of them with my face.

And behind them?

A shape in the treeline.

Barely visible.

Except for the eyes.

Reflective.

Watching.

I turned the photo over.

Someone had written something in pencil. Faded, almost gone.

“Don’t forget which one you are.”

I tried to laugh.

But I couldn’t remember what my voice sounded like.
