\*\*\*\*







He was right.  It *was* fucking him.  But…I looked from the body in the tub and back to Gil.

 

“How?”

 

Gilroy shrugged.  “I mean, I could try to bullshit like I know, or give some lame scifi answer like it means anything.  But…well, it’s gotta be magic, right?”

 

Everything felt unsteady around me and my head felt overly full, but even if I hadn’t been teetering on the edge of shock I don’t know if I’d have a better answer.  Giving up, I returned his shrug.  “Um, okay.  So what, the pen just magically clones you but dead?”

 

He nodded with a frown.  “See, that’s what I thought at first too.  But they aren’t exactly the same as me.  I think they might be other versions of me from other realities or something.  I’ve even had some that looked a few years older or younger than me, which is weird.  Maybe where they grew up things were just different though.  Like they aged different.”

 

I was still processing that when a thought occurred to me.  “Okay, so let’s say that’s what’s happening.  And every time you click the pen, a body appears, right?”

 

His frown deepened slightly, as though he knew where this was heading.  “Um, yeah.”

 

“And you’ve had the pen for how long?”

 

“Um, almost three years?”

 

I swallowed.  “Jesus.  Okay.  So like, how many times have you summoned a dead body with it?”

 

Gilroy coughed awkwardly.  “Um, a lot.”

 

Rolling my eyes, I continued.  “Ok.  And every time, a body comes, already dead but like really freshly dead.”

 

He nodded.  “Super fresh.”

 

“Ok, super fresh.”  Rubbing the bridge of my nose, I went on.  “And like you can use the pen whenever right?  Like you could click it again now…*don’t do that*….but you could and another body should pop out of nowhere, right?  Like, you aren’t on a cooldown or having to wait until you feel the time is right or something?”

 

He gave a small, solemn shake of his head.  “No.  I know how it sounds.  I get it.”

 

I grimaced at him.  “Do you?  Because it sounds like your magic pen is just killing people, alternate versions of you maybe, but other people, and then dropping the body in front of you like a fucking cat bringing you a gift.  How else would a freshly dead version always be ready whenever you decide to click it.”

 

Gil shoved his other’s foot out of the way and sat down on the edge of the tub.  “I know, I know.  I’ve thought the same thing.”  He was staring down at his hands as they milled over each other anxiously.  "But if it is me, then is it really murder?  Isn’t it more like me eating too much junk food or smoking or something?  Sure, it’s kind of killing me, but not totally and it is me I’m killing.”

 

I opened my mouth to say something harsh and closed it again.  He just looked too miserable in that moment for me to pile on.  Instead I went with another pressing question I had.

 

“Why?”

 

He looked up at me questioningly.

 

“I mean, not why does it do it.  I don’t expect you to know that.  But why use it after the first time?  What good is it?”

 

Lighting up again, Gil went to answer when there was a knock at the door.  “Shit, that’s Christof.”  Paling slightly, he grabbed a bag from a small bathroom closet and pulled several black trashbags from it.  “Sorry, man, just give me a minute.  I should have done this already.  Lost track.”

 

Gilroy awkwardly straddled the tub and pulled a bag over the body’s head, then another over each hand and foot, pulling the plastic drawstrings tight and knotting them with surprising dexterity and speed.  He was puffing slightly as he stepped off the tub, but he didn’t slow down as he went past me and out into the entryway of the suite.  Putting his hand on the door, he shot me a harried glance.

 

“Stay quiet and be cool, okay?”

 

Without waiting for a response, he opened the door and smiled awkwardly at someone I couldn’t yet see.  “Hey, man.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  My friend is here helping and I was busy showing him the ropes.”

 

A pause and then a lilting accent that sounded faintly French.  “So there will be no issues?”

 

Gilroy shook his head.  “Nope, everything is cool.  We’re ready for the docs.”

 

“Very well.  Be gone in three minutes.  I will text when you can return.”

 

Gilroy nodded and shut the door back.  “Jesus, that guy is always nice enough, but he still freaks me out.”  He looked over at me.  “Okay, man. Time for us to bounce.  We’ll talk more outside.”

 

“Wait, what is going…”

 

His expression darkened slightly.  “No, seriously.  Move your ass.  We can’t be here when they come up the elevator.  We’re leaving and taking the stairs.  Less talkie more walkie.”

 

Battling a mixture of confusion, annoyance and fear, I allowed myself to be led out of the suite and down to the lobby.  Once there, we moved out to the patio seating of one of the restaurants that was open all day.  No one was close by, but I still felt like I needed to whisper when we finally got settled in.

 

“So what…you’re selling the organs?”

 

Gilroy did a quick fingergun at me.  “Bingo.”

 

“How?”

 

“Well, the ice helps, and they are in there in less than ten minutes.  I tell them ahead of time when to come.  I’ve googled some stuff that makes it seem like they’d still have issues with lack of bloodflow, but maybe the teleportation helps with that or something?  Again, magic, I don’t know how it actually works.  But they’ve only ever had one or two dud organs as far as I know.”

 

Frowning, I shook my head and hissed at him.  “*No*.  I mean at what point did you go from an assistant manager in a shitty strip mall to an international organ trafficker?”

 

He recoiled slightly, looking like I’d slapped him.  “I mean, like almost three years ago, like I said.”

 

“Again, how did you manage that?  Did you watch a YouTube video on it?”

 

His expression brightened as he gave a laugh.  “No, man.  It was my Dad.  Like less than an hour after I used the pen, I get a call.  It’s this dude, um my Dad.  He asks me if I’ve used the pen yet.  I’m freaked the fuck out still, but I tell him yeah.  And what the fuck.  He tells me to stay calm.  That I’ve already passed the first test by not running out yelling for the police or whatever.  I kept a level head.  So now he’ll tell me what to do next.”

 

“Did he?”

 

Puffing out a long breath, he leaned back in his chair.  “Oh yeah.  Told me how to get rid of the body first.  Once I’d done that, he told me about…” he gestured around at the hotel.  “All of this.  This was something he set up years ago.  The dude who came to my door owns this place, and one of the side gigs he runs is what my dad did and passed on to me.”

 

“Selling organs from dead versions of yourself.”

 

Gil nodded.  “Yeah, it’s fucked up, but yeah.  And I mean, maybe it’s bad, but I do feel like it’s just taking from myself, if the bodies are even other people.  Maybe the pen just makes them.  Either way, I’m also saving people’s lives indirectly, so that’s something.”

 

I stared at him uncertainly.  “Yeah, I guess that’s true.  How much do you get for it?”

 

He smiled slightly.  “I get 100k per click.  They harvest the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and pancreas.  Usually get about 800-900k for the batch from what I understand.  They don’t take other tissues or like the corneas, well because of the bags.”

 

“Yeah, what was with that?”

 

Gilroy leaned forward.  “So that’s part of the smart way my Dad and Christof set this up, right?  I never see the docs, the docs never see me.  They don’t look at the face or mess with the hands or feet, so they have no idea who they’re actually harvesting from.  They don’t *want* to know, none of us do.  We all have some ignorance to protect us.”

 

I glanced around at the empty patio.  “Don’t you worry about the cops and stuff?”

 

He snorted.  “Down here?  Nah, man.  This place is like a little kingdom.  It’s self-contained.  Christoph has an industrial incinerator somewhere on the resort, and he gets rid of the leftovers late at night.  Even if someone tried to report something, he owns the cops around here.”

 

I just stared at him.  “Okay.  I guess I can see that.  But what does he think you’re doing?  Just murdering dudes and putting them in your bathtub for collection?”

 

Gil laughed.  “Dude, you’re looking at it wrong.  I get it.  I’m the same way.”  He leaned forward more.  “But dudes like this?  That this is what they do, not because of some magic pen but just this is what they are comfortable with?  They aren’t asking those questions if it doesn’t cause them issues.  It’s not like a moral or philosophical thing or whatever.  It’s just business.”

 

As strange as it may seem, my next question didn’t strike me until I asked it.  “Why are you showing and telling me all of this?”

 

Gilroy sat back and grinned.  “Because I don’t want to do this forever, man.  Don’t need to.  I’m not greedy, and staying at a free fancy place like this half the time isn’t bad, but I’m not built for it long-term.  I’ve socked away most of my money.  I want to do it awhile longer and then pass the pen on.”

 

“But why me?”

 

He shrugged.  “Why not you?  I don’t have any close friends, and we used to be buds.  And what’s the odds of me running into you again, especially here?  I took it as a sign as soon as I saw you.”

 

“Shit man, I don’t know.  I have a whole life.  A job, a girlfriend.  I can’t be going off and doing this like you are.  Even if I was comfortable with it, which no offense, I don’t know that I am.”

 

Gil was still smiling.  “Maybe, maybe not.  Never say never.  Just…when, if, the day comes and I call, answer the phone.  Hear me out.  And then decide.”

 

\*\*\*\*

 

The call came two years later.  I had changed jobs by then, and me and my girlfriend were no longer a thing.

 

I’d like to say I told him no.  That the strangeness and the danger and the moral grayness of it all was too much.  That I was stronger and smarter and better than that.

 

But the truth was, I’d been waiting almost a year for that call.  Checking my phone every day for some missed message, heart picking up whenever it rang.  I wasn’t sure what that life really was, but it seemed better than mine, or at the very least, it would give me enough money to buy a better life.

 

By the time he did call, I’d almost started losing hope.  Wondering if I’d dreamed the whole thing or gone a bit crazy.  I didn’t even have his number, and I’d never given him mine again.  If he didn’t have it from the old days, how would even find me?

 

But he did.  And I said yes.  And eight months later I was sitting in the same chair by the same pool I’d been at when I ran into him before.  Except this time I was there under my own steam and I had nearly a million of dollars in the bank.

 

I’d texted back and forth with him a bit since then, but not that much.  He was living his life and I didn’t want to be reminded of the unsavory part of my life any longer than I had to be.  I even had Christof give me a different room on another floor for when I wasn’t doing a delivery.  Just twice a week, in there for ten minutes, click, bag, and out again.  Over like a bad dream.

 

When I’d done it the first time, I’d half-wondered if it would still be Gilroy laying in the ice-filled tub.  It didn’t really track with what I thought I knew, but I still worried about it.  It somehow felt less wrong when it was my face staring back at me.

 

Gilroy had been right though.  It wasn’t really my face, not exactly. 

 

Some were thinner or fatter, bearded or scarred.  Bigger or smaller even.  But the weirdest thing was the age difference.  I’d always thought if parallel worlds were real, it would all pretty much be running at the same time.  So other mes should be roughly the same age as me, right?  But these bodies?  About half were close to me, but the rest?  All over the board.  Some pretty old and a few were just kids.  I almost vomited the first time I saw a dead twelve-year old version of me curled up on a mound of ice.

 

But like the rest of it, I decided that avoidance and minimization were the best options.  Get in and get out.  Compartmentalize it away from the fancy life I was living and the freedom I was saving for.

 

And for the most part it worked.  Most days I didn’t get knots in my stomach until the morning of a delivery. 

 

Until I saw the writing.

 

It was a normal delivery.  The second one of the week.  The body was almost identical to me, which was strangely a relief.  I was so used to quickly bagging and dipping out of the bathroom by that point that I barely paid attention to anything else, and because of that, I almost missed it.

 

Writing across the other me’s chest.  Just one line.
