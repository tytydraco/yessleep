Hey all. A lot has happened during the past day or so. I’ve calmed down a bit, so hopefully my writing will make some sense.

Much to my delight, Annie was enthralled to join me in this, and came over to my place pretty much as soon as the text appeared as read.

I brought her up to speed on the info I’ve gotten, thanks once again to Davis. Annie is much more tech-y than I am, so she took the reins in researching any possible leads concerning the kid’s online presence.

After a few search queries and new tabs, she found a matching Facebook page for Aiden O’Leary. Luckily for us, he seemed to be quite active on the site, posting pictures and videos of events and places he’d been to.

Of course, what we were looking for was anything that could hint us to his last known location. And lo and behold, that’s exactly what we found. Well, we assumed that to be so, given his following radio silence.

It was a selfie picture of himself and a friend on a hiking trail somewhere up in the hills. Both were kitted out with the generic set of backpacks, cargo shorts, sunglasses, the whole package. The image was captioned,

“What a great day to be out in nature! Wish you guys could see the view from up here.”

Even better, there was a location tag on the post. Nothing specific, of course, but it was labelled as being in or around the Salt Point trails, a network of time-worn paths hewn throughout an area of the local hill range. The place was almost a 50 minute drive away, which, on the scale of the country, is nothing at all.

With some additional link-clicking, we discovered that the buddy he’d been out with, along with himself, had been reported missing over 2 weeks ago. I don’t mean to be rude, Davis, but during that time I hadn’t even heard of this, let alone any efforts to track them down.

Anyhow, Annie and I had a free schedule for a good few days, so we decided on heading out there straight away. We made sure to pack all the necessary things: food, hiking poles, a small tent, probably more power banks than we needed, you get the picture. I may be a journalist, but I’ve gone on my fair share of treks living in this part of the country. I mean, how could you not? Sure, it can get sweltering in the summer months, but quite frankly that is easily ignored in favour of seeing the exquisite landscape. Besides, it’s spring anyway; not too hot, not too cold, but just right.

I was relieved to find Annie’s backup screenwash bottle by the time we arrived. Must have used two thirds of the tank already washing away the orange dust, that gathered around the windshield the way iron filings would to a magnet.

Annie isn’t a small person by any means, but with myself being 6’1”, I was bestowed the burden of carrying the heaviest load. In other words, I ended up lugging the tent bag up rocky, arid slopes and through spiky tallgrass. No luck found us for over an hour as we plodded on through the heat.

After summitting a particularly merciless hill, I was caught off guard by Annie pointing something out with an abrupt, “LOOK!”

I came to a stop and dropped my pack, giving myself a breather.

“What? If you’re gawking at those trees over there, just keep in mind we didn’t come out here to absorb nature.”

“Huh? No, Lou, look at the ground over there.”

I followed the direction of her outstretched finger to see what looked like heavy and rushed footprints in the sand ahead of us. They weren’t anything special, maybe left behind by a jogger or something. I didn’t really understand what had Annie so captivated.

“Ugh, you really need me to point it out for you? An investigative journalist?” she gasped, still out of breath.

“Yeah, actually. They’re just footprints.”

“No, look. Clearly, whoever made these was running in the opposite direction to us, and they lead off the trail just over there.”

I looked over in turn and she was right. It still wasn’t anything particularly noteworthy, but it did stir my thinking brain into wondering where this person had come from, out in the brush, and why they had been in such a hurry.

“No stone left unturned.” Annie said smugly.

“That’s not even how you use that- ah, fine. Noted.”

We continued along the track, heads swivelled to the left to see if we could track the prints any further. To our surprise, the prints came back up onto the trail, at which point a large area of scuffed sand and rocks became apparent.

“Hmm. A scuffle, looks like. What from, though?” I pondered. Annie simply nodded as she observed the surroundings, panning around for any further details.

She seemed to do a double-take, and stared at something.

“Uh… does that look like a rock to you?” she said, her tone lowered.

I gazed over to what she was seeing and was struck with a similar confusion.

A football-sized stone lay beside the disturbed sand, but I’d never seen anything like it. Parts of it shined, glistened with an odd, desaturated hue. I say that because the stone here is generally orange or red, but the spots where the sun glinted off, almost dazzlingly, were much closer to grey in colour. On top of that, it had a bizarre texture to it, wavy and grooved, almost like…

Annie cautiously approached the foreign object, then crouched down, swiping brunette strands out of her face. She prodded it with her walking pole. My brow furrowed further when, in response, the thing *jiggled*. Like it was made of jelly.

“Wait, no, it’s- holy shit. Lou… it’s a brain.”

“Wh…what?”

“A brain! I’m no anatomist, but that looks awfully similar to a- a *human brain*.”

The realisation made me recoil in disgust, and with morbidly comedic timing, the smell hit my nostrils. The sickly-sweet stench of past-fresh meat, festering in the midday heat.

But it didn’t smell like your bog-standard rotten flesh. No, there was an almost smoky hint to it. One could have chalked that up to the sun acting as an open cooker, but after willing myself to inspect the brain more closely, I realised it was covered in scorches and severe burn marks.

“Hey, it doesn’t look like there was any wildfire here, right?” I asked Annie, who’d also noticed the oddity.

“If there was, it was a stealthy one.” she half-heartedly joked. Not the time, Annie.

We should’ve turned back, then. I don’t know why we kept going. Maybe because I’d been running dry on meaty stories, maybe to get to the bottom of this conundrum, I don’t know. It was irresponsible, yeah, but something deeper in the mountains was calling out to me, asking me to come and see what it’s hiding.

The terrain was more forgiving now, at the very least, and with the sunset came a cool blanket of dusk air, which felt great. We settled on walking for another 30 or 40 minutes before setting up camp and calling it a day.

I couldn’t help but feel uneasy, hiking through the quickly darkening valley, though thankfully the right of the path was mostly clear, giving the growing moonlight a straight shot to illuminate our route.

Darkness took residence in the shrubs and trees around us. At some point, I can’t remember when, I got the distinct feeling that we were being watched, from somewhere out of sight. A few times I thought I heard rustling nearby, but remained vigilant, keeping the lid on the creeping dread that wished to overtake me.

I was so focused on settling my mind that I didn’t even notice Annie had stopped dead in her tracks, and I bumped into her back. I went to apologise, before seeing her frozen stance. Understanding it was best to keep quiet, I followed her gaze to see, to my horror, a hairy face peeking out from the bushes to our left.

The fluorescent green eyeshine from Annie’s torch betrayed a god-damned mountain lion. Of course. Just our luck. The bastard had probably only just now come out to hunt, and its eyes were set on us. If you ever come across a mountain lion out in the hills, you can be sure that it saw you a good while before you noticed.

It seemed to register its hiding place had been foiled, and it slinked out onto the path ahead of us.

“Slowly, back away,” I whispered. I remembered then the rule of making yourself as big as possible, but we had no coats to spread open. So, I came closer to Annie, and said,

“Hey, get up on my shoulders, quick.”

She understood my intent and followed my instructions, after I had bent down onto one knee. I grasped her shins in my hands and stood back up with some effort.

The big cat didn’t seem to like this, and recoiled momentarily, before composing itself and letting out a low growl. If you’ve ever heard the growl of a mountain lion, you’ll understand the primal fear it instils.

Methodically, it resumed its movement toward us, testing the limits to see how close it could get before striking. Panicking, I kicked a stone at it with as much force as someone carrying a person could give. It yowled in surprise for a second, but this one was determined, and continued its approach.

It was then that the rapidly forming cloud formation that smothered the moonlight came to my attention. Somewhere far above the peaks ahead, swirling grey clouds grew into a dense mass of mind-bending coils.

It happened so suddenly that I almost dropped Annie. An intense light flickered on from somewhere inside that murky nebula, before an intense beam of light erupted from within. It was the most powerful spotlight I’d ever seen, panning across the valley in saccade-like movements, searching for… something. Every time it swivelled, a distant vibration could be heard, which I imagine is what also drew the mountain lion’s attention away from us.

Before it could even turn all the way to look, the white floodlight fell upon it. Instantly, the cat fell onto its side, yowling and screeching while it convulsed in pain.

Even from a distance, I could see its hairs singe and smoke, its skin bubbling as if exposed to the surface of the sun, before pale white flames spewed out from its eyes, ears, nose, and mouth, and in an instant completely engulfed the wailing animal.

The poor creature screamed unrelentingly for what felt like hours, when in reality it was more like 20 seconds or so, until just as quickly as it had settled, the spotlight started its frantic motion once more.

Annie broke our shared stupor, and pushed herself off of my shoulders with adrenaline-fueled agility. She grabbed me by the wrist and hauled me over to a large boulder off to the right to take cover.

Mere seconds after we reached it, the gleam cast the rock’s shadow, which stretched out far behind us. There we sat, shivering in fear, contrasting the unmoving light that waited for us to emerge.

For the following five minutes, my heart yearned to leap out from my chest. So when we were once again plunged into darkness, the relief washed over me in waves. I waited another few minutes, looking into Annie’s wide, grey eyes, before daring to glance out from behind the rock.

Those clouds were gone, but underneath where they once were I saw something that, somehow, I hadn’t initially seen. There looked to be some building higher up on the slope of a large hill – it was dark, and distant, but even then I recognised the architecture to be unlike any other structure you might find in the state, hell, the country even.

After feeling like I’d stared longer than considered safe, I returned behind the boulder and looked over to Annie, who was just as shaken as I. With an effort to ignore the smell of burnt hair and flesh, we set up our tent without a word, and climbed inside.

Thank god there’s reception out here. The sole fact of having access to the internet calmed my nerves enough for me to write this up.

We’re gonna sleep this feeling off, hopefully. I haven’t told Annie about that building up ahead. I’ll show her tomorrow, but even then it’ll take some convincing to get her to come. I know, I know, how could I possibly want to go any further after what I’ve just seen? Call me crazy, but the events of today have only added more fuel to the fire of my intrigue.

[I'll report back after whatever happens tomorrow. Stay safe, everyone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/11di5jh/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_2/)
