All right, I get it. I know what you're thinking: we're reading a story about a crazy motherfucker. Feel free to take off if you're super unnerved.

_(Viewer count: diminished)_

Damn. Well, I still need to get this off my chest. Because people might think I'm a freak if I just let this happen without giving any context first. You'll probably still think I'm a freak after said context.

But first I want to relate this to something. You know how people can form emotional attachments to inanimate objects? The closer they look to something living, the more powerful the bond. Just keep this in mind.

I'm Amanda. 20 years old. Soon to graduate community college with an Electronics associate's degree, or whatever it's called...fuck, I can't really wrap my head around the more trivial things I should be remembering right now. I'm just glad to be almost out of there, and to escape my ex boyfriend Donald. He's so pushy and aggressive and he just can't get that it's over.

I work Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons (and every other Saturday) at a place called Anthony's Trade's, 'Tiques and Thrift. Classy, huh? But I love cluttered, whimsical places like this, and as the staff is so small and unchanging over the last few years (it's a job people settle into for longer than they expected because of the pay), it felt perfect for me.

The owner, Anthony, won some large heap of money many years ago----lottery, investments, I dunno, he won't tell. But he opened this place, and pays his employees generously, just because he can, so why the hell not. Real big, jolly looking guy. You'd think he was Santa Claus, with the season being in full swing now and all. He even decorated parts of the shop, and with the ceiling being so low, it was easy to get creative.

Colored lights strung here and there...

Wreaths hung over some of the lights...

A paper-mache gingerbread house in the middle of the electronics display table (giving a wide berth to the products, of course)...

...And red hats and jingle-bell vests on the clothes department mannequins.

The mannequins. The fucking MANNEQUINS.

Look, I've never really been that interested in mannequins. And he shuffles them in and out from time to time, replaces them every so often. There are a few he likes and keeps around, though.

One is an old man sitting in a rocking chair, who models the more old fashioned clothes in the department. Anthony named him Fryder.

The second is a wavy-blonde surfer dude who shows off the latest styles (that Anthony can get his hands on, at least). Anthony named him Beau. Beau is the only one who wears a wig that can be changed out, but Anthony just keeps the blonde one on him, occasionally cleaning it.

The third is a young woman with a timid, gentle face and thick, bushy brown ponytail that hangs past her shoulders, who models the womens' modern styles. Her name is Alice, though Anthony said she was already called that when she arrived. Not when he _got_ her...when she arrived. Interesting word choice, maybe. Her hair is tightly fastened, woven in just like Fryder's, but easy to accidentally pull.

I know this because I did that on my third week by accident.

It was still late November, but we were getting a head start on the decorating. After the first couple weeks giving Alice shy sidelong looks, hoping she wouldn't notice and make me realize I was making a fool out of myself, I was placing a Christmas train set decoration on the little square table next to the pillar on the far left she hangs out at. I was blushing a bit as I did so; I routinely avoided Alice in those earlier days, as I never really could think of anything interesting to say, and I always wondered if she thought I looked kind of drab or anything, or would be boring, I dunno.

After placing the trains down and trying to avoid her lovely gaze (she was looking straight forward, almost right at me from the current angle), I noticed the corded lights wrapped around the pillar had become lopsided, as though someone had reached over and yanked them down slightly, just to mess with us. It really didn't look like it could have happened on its own.

I managed to glance at Alice, and stepped to the left just a bit so she was looking at me. My heart fluttered, but as I had a legit question now, I was able to keep my cool.

"Alice," I whispered, knowing Anthony would think I'd gone off my rocker if he could hear me, "did you pull those lights down a bit?"

She didn't answer me. I began to blush a little again; maybe it was obvious that she hadn't, and she thought it dumb of me to ask. Alice was here to model clothes, not to ruin festive displays, and maybe I was being a little rude.

I looked down a bit. "Sorry," I muttered. "Forget I said that." I reached up to pull up the lopsided section, but the bit on the back of the pillar slid up a little too far when I did.

I walked around behind Alice to pull it back down----and as I did, Alice's ponytail shifted. I realized too late that several strands had gotten caught in the light cord, and I'd just yanked them.

"Oh!" I gasped. "I-I'm sorry! I didn't mean to, I----" I quickly separated her hair from the cord, adjusted it, and scooted back in front of Alice. Forgetting my embarrassment, I reached up and stroked her ponytail, sifting it gently, apologizing quietly over and over as I tried to massage away the shock of pain I'd caused her.

She didn't move, though. I realized I might be acting a little too intrusive, and lowered my hands. "Sorry...is that okay?" I asked reluctantly, already realizing I'd made myself look like a total clown to her.

She didn't reply.

I looked around again to make sure nobody was watching (there's Anthony, and two other staff members named Shanika and Logan, both in their early twenties), and then whispered, "I'll be right back."

I went to the back of the store where the employees only hall was, and got my purse out of my locker. My hairbrush was in it. I stared at it for several seconds, realizing suddenly that there was _no way in hell_ Alice wanted me brushing my germs through her hair. That would be a pretty shitty way to repay her for my accidentally pulling it.

I went back outside and looked around; I wasn't supposed to shop on duty, but well, right now there were no customers and my only job at the moment was just to make sure everything looked tidy. Anthony was reading a magazine in the break room, Shanika was on her phone at the checkout counter, and Logan was off sweeping in a faraway corner.

This job is so peaceful. I love it.

Soon I found what I wanted: a used, but super disinfected and freshened up yellow plastic hairbrush. Shanika grinned at me as I purchased it from her at the counter; nobody really took that no buying while on duty rule too seriously.

I walked back over to Alice and faced her. "This is yours, okay?" I said softly, holding it up so she could see. "I'll only use it on you."

Suddenly, a lump formed in my throat, and for a moment my shyness was forgotten as a wave of emotion crashed through me. Tears sprung to my eyes, but I quickly blinked them away. "Bit dusty in here," I threw out lamely.

Trying to diffuse the awkwardness, I reached up with the brush behind her and began to gently stroke it through her hair. It was a pretty messy ponytail, after all; the least I could do was fix it up a little for her. It seemed to be that way naturally though, because I couldn't really straighten her hair out that well. It was like a bushy sponge; like how a woman with naturally curly hair looks if she tries to brush her hair straight.

It looked a little neater when I was done, but not much different. Still, I hoped it had been a little relaxing for her. It wasn't like she was up to anything. Again, I felt that emotion pounding against my insides, but I tried my best to ignore it.

At the end of our shifts, Shanika could tell something was bothering me. "You all right, girl? Didn't find a stray hair in that brush, did you?"

I waved off her teasing and said "I'm fine. School stuff."

"Well, don't burn out. With a job like this, I'd hope it'd be pretty hard to. See, I'm twenty-two and I need this job full time just so I can afford college later, but I feel great."

I had to clamp down on the rage that suddenly threatened to burst forth.

_When's the last time you were forced to stand rigid for years in a thrift store while other people touched you all the time, never bathed you, and changed your clothes only once a month?_

I cooled it quickly before she could notice anything was off. Shanika was a good woman, Anthony and Logan were good men, I had nothing against them. But I already had that innate knowledge that you NEED when dealing with things like this.

The knowledge that they were now, and would always be, so different. So close minded. They would never understand, and it was best that I leave that alone, not try to make them get it. They were unnaturally kind people...but to Alice? They treated her like store property.

I know the same thing about Fryder and Beau was true as well, but I didn't feel that same connection with them. They looked too stony, too unrealistic, and I knew it was because I wasn't on their wavelength. There were people out there who could see them for who they were, but I wasn't that person for them.

So why I could see Alice...I had no idea at the time. Everyone else would only see a product, something to be displayed. That's so nasty to me. Maybe I'm biased because I don't really care the same way about Fryder and Beau, but...again...they don't want me to care. I'm not the right person to notice them.

I just toss an occasional "what's up" their way, or pretend to talk to them like they're puppets, then laugh. Sometimes the other staff are there to laugh too. But that's really all Fryder and Beau want out of me, I'm sure. I'm just another person to them.

The same way everyone else must be to Alice.

"Amanda, you good with closing up shop?" ol' Anthony called out, showing me as he set the store keys on the counter. I knew the drill; lock up the displays and the employee room, put the keys in their coded safe, then leave through the store entrance and lock its coded dead bolt. "M'wife called. Sister's in town for a surprise visit, sounds like my niece is gonna have a baby."

I loved the way his eyes twinkled as he told me the news. Anthony's such a great guy.

"No problem," I called back, smiling. And like that, five minutes later it was just me.

I made one last round around the store to make sure everything was tidy, no products fallen over or knocked on the floor, no egregious dirt piles on the carpet that needed serious vacuuming...

Then I made my way around to Alice, about ready to get my stuff and leave.

Her expression was the same as always, just neutral and a bit glassy and lifeless with her rock-hard plastic eyes lacking human transparency, and yet...

I don't know why I couldn't hold it in. I started shaking, and the next thing I knew, I was hugging her and sobbing into her shoulder like a torrential downpour. She didn't raise her arms or anything; I don't blame her. I was a mess.

"I'm sorry," I sniffled. "I just don't have any idea what it's _like,_ you know? What you go through, day after day, for years...nobody understands, nobody loves you like you deserve, and the pain...the goddamn _pain_ you must feel, inside and out, never moving unless someone makes you, always looking at the same things for weeks on end..."

I finally managed to pull my pathetic ass together and stood in front of her wiping my eyes. I couldn't help myself, and leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek. "I wish someone would know what to do," I whispered. "Because I don't. I have no idea how to help. I don't know anything. I'm just...a human. But you, Alice...you're something incredible. You deserve so much more."

I hadn't realized I'd been holding her hands while I spoke. I let go of them, blushing for the millionth time, and excused myself.

I got my purse and jacket out of my locker, closed it and turned around, and there she was, standing in the door down the hall, leaning in just a bit to peek around the corner, smiling softly at me.

My heart skipped a beat. _She moved. She did it just for me._

"Alice?" I whispered nervously, hopefully. I approached her, but my hopes faded as I did.

Alice's gaze did not follow me. She remained fixed there, looking past me toward the spot I'd been standing, at my locker about twenty feet behind me now.

"Alice," I whispered again, stroking her ponytail, knowing now that she didn't mind. But she didn't move.

Alice wasn't too heavy, but it was a ways back to her pillar, so it took me a few minutes to carry her there. By the time I was done, standing up and looking at her, I realized this would never work.

There she remained in her fixed position, standing and leaning slightly forward, her hands up as though grasping a doorframe, a gentle, almost sympathetic smile on her face.

Everyone would realize she had changed. Alice was one of those kinds of mannequins whose limbs and head couldn't be detached or rotated, so there was no way anyone would believe she'd just been altered. Besides, that wouldn't explain her new expression either. Her eyes looked almost human this way.

Oh, well. It wasn't like there was any feasible way they'd blame me. There were security cameras, but only looking outside of the store. They wouldn't see my interactions with Alice. Nothing I could do now anyway.

_BANG._

I spun around in a fright, staring at the front door.

Donald.

He was glaring in at me, his face set in a deep frown, his hands on the glass of the door, which Anthony had already locked (out of habit, I'm sure). But I was thanking him deep down right at that moment.

Donald, twenty-one with a short brown buzz cut and looking more like he was cut out for the military rather than changing majors at a community college three different times out of sheer boredom, was the very picture of open-the-fucking-door.

"Amanda, I want to talk. You can't keep ignoring me like this."

"Yes I can," I yelled back at him. "I don't fucking want to talk to you."

"Well, I found out where you work now, so what's that do for you?" he threatened. "You wanna make this shit hard? Be all dramatic, play the victim like you always do?"

I folded my arms. "You're such a sad little boy, Donald."

"Look, I could have ANY chick at school, and I'm choosing you. The least you could do is open the goddamn door and hear me out. Give me another chance. Don't be stupid."

"I've been stupid for three months," I called back, turning away from him pointedly to adjust some random thing on Alice's shirt. Absentmindedly, I reached up and stroked her ponytail again; it was easy, the way she was leaning over slightly. "But I finally did the right thing and dropped your ass. You should really go, there's security cameras outside and I can call 911 if you don't fuck off."

He answered by pounding on the glass again. But Anthony's money had bought a pretty sturdy structure. The glass was like half an inch thick, and there was no way Donald's meat beaters were punching their way through.

He turned away and stalked back toward his truck. I smiled with satisfaction, and turned back to Alice.

I nearly jumped out of my skin.

Her posture had changed. She was standing upright, stiff as a board, staring right at me, eyes wide with terror. Haunted eyes.

What had changed to make her look at me like that?

"Alice?" I whispered, trembling. The look on her face was actually pretty terrifying. "D-did I do something? Did you not want to be touched?"

I glanced back toward Donald. "Or is it him? He can't do any----"

I stopped because Donald was now stalking back toward the front doors with a metal baseball bat in his hand.

"Are you fucking insane?" I shrieked, forgetting my fear at Alice's reaction.

_BAAAAANG!_ He whacked the door once. The sound echoed through the store like a gunshot.

"Alice!" I shrieked, turning back to her. I could hear Donald laughing at me through the door, but I didn't care. I wasn't going to just run off to the safety of the employee hall and leave her out here alone; what if he went after her? I wasn't _positive_ that he would see her as just a mannequin. I mean, you never know about some people. I don't know if Donald is one of the kinds of people who could see her.

_BAAAAANG!_ This time the glass visibly cracked. I stood my ground and planted myself right in front of Alice, fists balled. If he was going to go after her, he'd have to get through me first.

His enraged expression twisted into a wild grin as he saw the damage he was doing to the door, and quickly reared back for the third blow.

_SMASH._ A gaping hole opened up in the doorway. Donald stepped through. "Security system isn't going off," he taunted, looking left and right. His eyes landed on what he was looking for----the light switches by the door. He reached out and started flipping them on and off. "Guess the cops only come when you call them yourself."

_Security cameras, you dumb shit,_ I wanted to yell. _Not every set of them is a sophisticated system that calls the emergency number when a door breaks open._

The lights were off. He was coming closer. I realized I'd have to fake him out. "Alice, you go right! I'll go left!" I called, then quickly and as gently as I could, yanked her down toward the floor. In the darkness, the motion hopefully looked like she had darted out of sight. I set her down gently, squatted down, making sure her head didn't bump the floor painfully; she stared up at me with her wide, unblinking eyes.

Remaining too low for Donald to see, I scooted off to the left, toward the middle of the store. I could hear him stampeding after me, the bat banging and scraping against the floor.

But he lost track of me pretty quickly. "Where the fuck are you?" he snarled, racing this way and that through the clothes department while I hid inside a rack of thick fur coats.

"Now, there's no need for language like that!" called a stern, unfamiliar voice. I'd never heard it before. It sounded like an old man.

_No way..._ I couldn't dare to let myself believe it. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear it. Donald stopped moving.

"How many fucking people are in here?" he cried. He sounded a bit unnerved now; he hadn't burst into here expecting a bunch of others to see him. He probably thought I'd meant someone else by Alice's name, and now there was a third person in the store somewhere.

"Goin' nuts after a gal is no bueno, my man," called a cheerful, husky voice nearby. I froze as Donald came closer. Suddenly, I heard a metallic _whoosh,_ and Donald yelped----as though the bat had been snatched from his hand.

"Amanda, I'm gonna fuckin' kill your ass for this!" Donald shrieked, but he sounded terrified now. I could hear him running away, and heavy pounding footsteps went after him.

I couldn't think of anyone right then but Alice. I knew, of course, what must be going on----maybe in times of emergency, any of them out there, any one of them at all, could always show themselves, but right now I was only concerned for her.

I wanted to stay as hidden as possible, but I forced myself back out of the coat rack. Donald was far off by now, anyhow. I trailed back to where I'd left Alice, but she wasn't there. Even weirder, Beau was still in his spot further to the back of the clothes department, barely having shifted at all.

My stomach boiled with rage. "Donald!" I shrieked, balling my hands into fists again.

In response, I heard only pounding footsteps far away. Objects clattered and fell over on the far side of the store.

I dashed across the middle aisle. _"IF YOU HURT ONE HAIR ON HER HEAD, I'LL RIP YOUR FUCKING THROAT OUT AND SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!"_ I bellowed.

I'll admit, my head wasn't screwed on too well just then.

But even with the lights off, what I was seeing was unmistakable.

Alice stood upright facing away from me, and as I ran around in front of her, I could see that she was in the same neutral position she'd always been in. Looking straight forward. Normal expression.

But the smell that hit my nostrils was anything but normal. I turned around and, gleaming in the moonlight, I could see Donald with his chest covered in something dark, twitching on the floor.

His chest was open, ribcage clearly visible, as though something had clawed through it in a blind rage.

I stepped closer to him, stared down at him, and waited.

Waited for him to stop twitching.

When he finally slumped and stopped moving, I closed my eyes and breathed a shaky sigh of relief. I kept them closed, waiting. Hoping.

I felt them. Two hands. One that touched my neck, gently rested against my throat. The other one softly stroked my hair.

Inhumanly hard hands. Covered in something warm and wet that dripped down my neck, soaked into my shirt, mixed into my hair at their touch.

I closed my eyes, took a deep breath of the smell, and let it out in a long, slow moan of contentment, of relaxation. I wouldn't have to worry about him ever again.

I shivered with pleasure and let Alice touch me. I could sense her movement as she slowly leaned forward behind me. Closer.

And kissed my cheek back.

I'm not quite sure how I got home that night. I remember stumbling out to my car, dizzy and happy with the stench of Donald's blood all over me. The smell made me feel drunk and delirious. Elated.

Did I lock the door with the code? I don't remember. I do remember going home, throwing the clothes into the wash with plenty of soap, and getting the best sleep I'd gotten in a while.

The next day was Saturday. Lucky me, no class, and an afternoon to closing shift at the store. If I still worked there. If the place wasn't swarming with cops ready to arrest me.

Strangely, everything was completely normal. The door, as intact and unbreakable as ever, gleamed in the sunlight. Anthony, back near the old TV counter, smiled and waved. I waved back.

I walked into the store and saw that nothing was out of place. Nothing had been knocked to the floor. I was disappointed when I took a deep breath and only smelled the familiar, slightly musty pleasant scent of the store.

There was no trace of Donald. It was like he'd never been there. The door had been locked with the code, the keys had been put in the safe.

I wonder, wink wink, who could have possibly cleaned all that up and put everything back in order for me?

I do wonder _how,_ but that's a question for a never kind of day. I can say that safely because the days keep going by, and nothing crazy ever happens. No clues pop up, no elephant-in-the-room questions get answered, so I ignore them. If Donald simply doesn't seem to exist anymore, then maybe those elephants don't either.

Alice stands around, as always, but a nice change is that I'm now in charge of changing her outfits. I get to take her to the back and decide on a new set of clothes for her. Christmas was a success (for what you can say, considering it's a thrift store and our customer count, while doubling, still wasn't phenomenal), and now it's almost time for Valentine's Day.

Dressing Alice in lovely red and pink was a really nice time. I hope nobody thinks we were back there too long; I kept my eyes averted while changing her, she doesn't know me _that_ well yet, but I think we bonded even more in the comfortable silence back there while I went through the racks of clothes I'd wheeled back, smiling at her every once in a while.

Just before I got ready to carry her out, I gave her my usual translation of "thanks again for saving my life" that I usually did nowadays since actually saying the words breathlessly had gotten old pretty fast (probably to her, too) and kissed her on the lips.

Tee hee. It's not like anyone out front is gonna know. They never see me do it even out there, either.

But if anyone looks super close, they might see her cheeks turn slightly pink, just for a moment.

I guess Alice has answered me well enough, even if she doesn't speak. _You never had to do anything special. Just trying to understand, just being there, being a friend and maybe more, is all I want._ I can see it in her eyes.

I do need to be careful not to take it too fast. She does seem to like me back, but I didn't want to throw myself at her all at once.

I finally got her back into position, and stroked my fingers over her throat gently as I adjusted her hair back into place. I felt her shiver with pleasure at my touch.

The door opened. A tall guy with floppy blonde hair and a plain blue shirt walked in, looking totally bored, with a timid looking young woman trailing behind. She darted glances here and there as she stepped in.

"Ooh, look at this place, baby," she cooed in a falsely bright, cheery tone that sounded like it was intended to pacify. "I bet we could find some neat stuff here, what do you think?"

"I don't give a fuck," he shrugged. "Ain't got nothing better to do. Just don't take all day." He lounged around the front, then finally pulled out a cigarette and stepped back out the front door. Out of the corner of my eye, I could visibly see the young woman, just about my age, slump slightly and sigh with apparent relief.

Look, first impressions aren't everything, okay? But there's a lot you can pick up from them anyway. And as she walked past me and Alice, evidently thinking I was a mannequin too by the way I stood so still next to her, she reached up and touched the side of her head, wincing, and lifted a patch of hair up.

I stared as she felt around a dark bruise the hair had been hiding. Beside me, Alice stiffened as she sensed my change in attitude, and her head turned.

The look on her face was not happy.

"Well? You got what you wanted yet?" the asshole yelled through the door he'd propped open, and blew some smoke into the shop. Logan, far away, looked up at him with a frown. But we couldn't reprimand customers without Anthony on scene, in case of confrontation. "You're takin' all damn day in here."

I stared at him hungrily, licking my lips, and I could almost smell Donald again from all those weeks ago. The smell of someone who would hurt innocent people, maybe even kill them if he got the chance and was angry enough. The smell of him getting what he deserved. The smell of reaping the sight, the justice of it.

Sure, he might not be as bad. But maybe I could find out more about him, see just how horrible he could get. What if I could convince her to leave him? What would he say? What would he do? Maybe I should make friends with her. Get into her life. Be someone who could protect her.

I felt Alice gently squeeze my hand behind me, and I knew what her silent message was.

_Whatever happens, I'm with you._

That was good. I'd rather have nobody else by my side than Alice. And plus, I'd learned that she could help get rid of any mess that might be made. Maybe she could teach me those ways. I might need them pretty often in the future, now that I'd finally found something worth pursuing even more than a career in electronics. I wondered if there were jobs out there that thrived on experience in culling.

I imagined the young man with his stomach cut open, and savory warmth pouring out.
