Hitman, murderer, assassin, whatever you want to call it. I don't really care, but paid killer just sounds nice to me I guess.

Honestly, I actually never tried to take multiple targets for a contract. Normally it's a terrible idea, considering there is of course multiple people. Usually only received one target anyway, originally I was planning on declining, but when I got an absurd amount of money, I decided to take this.

My client even sent me a file of extensive research for each family member. There was Cody, Allison, Leonard, and Kelly, two parents, two children. Only issue is that there were no photos of any of the targets. Which was a slight problem considering I'd have no clue what they looked like. But I got enough information on them, such as location plus routines, also going to mention it, but money is money.

I immediately got to work on a planned date, 11:59 PM, December 31st. The family will be all gathered together for the New Years, it's perfect.

The time had come already. I had the perfect spot, the perfect weapon for the deed, and the perfect shot for each family.

Before hand I did make notes for the furniture if any of them try to hide. It seemed flimsy from my previous observations. A bullet from my rifle could easily penetrate it.

I layed on a hill, in a snow covered ghillie suit and some basic camouflage on my rifle, suppressor included. I checked my watch, 11:58. I scoped in and aimed for the father.

Unexpectedly, he stared back, right at me. I looked confused, shocked.

It was my client, did he actually just pay me to kill him and his entire family? Then every single member of that household stared at me.

Did they spot me, was it a glint from my scope? No matter, it was 11:59, I held my breath, and took the shot. I cocked my rifle as I exhaled and got ready to aim for the mother. My eyes widened. The father was still standing, a clear shot through the head, no blood even came out from his wound.

I was quick get up and swing my rifle over my shoulder to get out of there. That family is not human, and I got paid to do the impossible. I got into my truck and started the ignition.

When I slammed on the gas pedal to leave the vicinity, I didn't get far. My tires were slashed, definitely.

So this is karma. I couldn't keep my composure and I definitely started freaking out a little, my heart was racing.

Getting out of my truck was the best idea, either way I was going nowhere with my tires destroyed, so I ran. I couldn't run near the streets, but there was a forest where I constructed a hideout shack a place to lay low, that was my Plan B if something went wrong.

Although by wrong I meant the cops or a neighbor sighting me, not this.

So I ran to the general direction of the forest. I reached into the pockets I made myself and grabbed my compass. Directly North East, and that's where I went.

Luckily I did make it to the shack. However I only have one bar of connection, and I'm definitely certain that family could be hunting me.

My rifle is close to me, bullets didn't harm them, but maybe if I used it blunt it could work.

Do I regret my decisions in life for my choices?

No, I don't. There aren't any regrets I have, none.

But I'm definitely scared right now, if that family found me, I wouldn't stand any chance. I'm basically just screwed, really screwed.

If I ration my supplies properly, I'd say I have a week to survive. As in advance I did prepare food for this shack, since I usually lay low for a while.

Still though, this whole thing kind of scares me. What is that family, how didn't the father die, why did my client pay for me to kill him and his wife and kids, and if they aren't human, what are they?

I have a bad feeling, something is definitely close.
