Me 13 female and I lived in a haunted house.

When I was really younger I saw 2 ghosts every night standing in the bathroom while I was showering and that was not the only thing. I heard footsteps every time when I sat in my room playing with the barbies. I heard screaming noises in the attic in the night. This happend all when I was toddler.

But this isnt the end of it. I told it my mother is thousand times. She didnt believed me. Until she heard a screaming noise from the attic. She said the next day: 'You were true. I heard it too!' I said: 'I speak every time the true.' We got ghosts hunters and the ghosts hunters said: 'There are some ghosts but it isn't harmfull.' This happend when I was 7

The next day I woke up with scratches on my arm. My mom was again very skeptical. I said: 'the ghosts hunters weren't true!' My dad said: 'Believe her one time.' She said: 'She can be delusion.' It was time for school, so I did pick up me bag and I leaved. When I arrived at school. Some kids said: 'What's that m/n?' I said: 'I don't really know.' There was the one kid and she said: 'Also ghosts in the house, look out. You can become insane.' I said: 'Why?' She said back: 'After all the shit you hear and see, you can become insane.'

It was a boring day at school. When I went back to home. I heard that one kid screaming my name. After I stopped and I and lets call her Kristy were biking next to each other. She said everthing I needed to hear, about living in a paranormal house. I went back home and my mom was sitting in a corner of the sofa with a anxiety attack. I said: 'What's wrong?' She said with fear: 'My beautifull vase fell of the sofa table.... I saw it right in front of me!' I said: 'Let's life with it!'

After that thing turned crazy but not normal crazy but insane crazy. It was like the ghosts heared me!

About a week later I sat down on the dinning table with my dad, mom and little sister. We heard first footsteps in the hallway, than the door went open and like 2 second later the glass of my little sister cup fell down on the table. We looked shocked and eated further.

I sat with my ipad in my room with my little sister, that's when we heared at big slap on my room's door. We lived further like it was normal.

I moved houses, because of this: a creepy man stalked every night I was about 8 years old. We were sitting on the sofa one evening in the winter. My dad was looking outside the window. That's when he saw a man with a creepy face. His eyes were white and glowy. He freaked out and he started screaming aboutt the man. My little sis said: 'What! Dad! Chill! Tell about what you saw.' He told it. Night after night: we saw the man every night. My mom asked the neighboor and other people that were living in our neighboorhood. Some people said they had that 'phase' too, some said no, but a very old couple were saying said: 'Is the old man that was burried alive, but it is interesting that he still lives in this neighboorhood.' The old man asked which house number to you live. My mom said: '56.' The old man said back: 'Oke, I spare you the stories.' My mom said back again: 'What stories?' The old woman this time said back: 'We dont say that, dot.' and she and I walked back to home.

Everything was fine. Until the stalker climbed the way up to my room and pushed me out of bed. I was screaming so hard that everyone could hear it! My mom pushed and slapped the stalker. The hand of my mom went straight trough it. She slammed the door and she said in a freaked way: 'Come and sleep with me.' Dad was in the meantime awake and my dad said: 'What is happening?!' My mom and I told the whole story. My dad said: 'Let's sell the house now!' We called grandma right after and she said: 'You all can stay the whole day, but I have not the space to lay 4 matteres down.'

After the dining. We drove back to our house. I picked up the ghost hunting equiqment and I went to the attic with fear, because I heard scratching noises and disgusting noises. I invested the attic and I had no contact or anything. I stayed up all night. My dad and mom tried, but they fell asleep. I heardn't that one screaming noise the whole night. That was the time it stopped.

This thing what I'm going to tell you haunt me still everytime I think abt it.

This one night. The weird old man was watching me and my dad and mom probally the whole night. He said to me when I waked up: 'It's time, to terrorize youre whole life and you going to end up dead.' And he walked to my room. I waked up my mom and dad and said what I heard.

She called my billionare aunt right after. She said that we can live in her house in the forrest about 20 miles away. I was freaked out. I thought what if a monster lived in the that forest. and my aunt said:' I'll buy you food and clothes.'

My dad waked up my sister, my mom packed our stuff and I closed the windows. The monster came downstairs and it said: 'We are you goning to. Stay with me. Its safe I promise.' We ran with our jackets to the door. My little sister opend the door and we ran to our home. My mom forgot the car key. She ran back into our old house and 1 minute later she came out of the house and ran to the car and drove. We litterlay abon  that house. We drove to the house and after 2 years we still life here. Nothing happend to us... yet.
