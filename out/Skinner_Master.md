I tried reaching out to Dez, couldn't find him. Or get info about where he might be. His uncle was a deadbeat junkie who spent most of his time passed out. Nathan was awfully calm.I didn't ask him about Dez, but his words still lingered in my mind.

I opened the documents, it was a journal. Well pictures of a journal.

"Nathaniel D Parker"

Was written on top it was my grandpa's journal. It read:

What I did at the war, I'm not proud of. I'll refrain from putting dates so that it doesn't get traced back to me. During the war most of my men were gunned down, the rains came with heavy winds that left us no choice but to stay hurdled up in the trenches. These were my brothers, I trained with them. Fought with and I was about to die with them.

The enemy had us pinned down, no food no heat. No nothing, I only got warmth from my brothers in arms, my comrades. With no source of heat, I ripped off the clothes of my fallen brothers. That did nothing to help me ward off the cold I was freezing, death lingering waiting for a chance to snatch me so I took my knife and started carving their skin. I flayed everyone I considered a brother. I had ran out of water and rain water was too salty for me so I drank blood from those who were still fresh. Knitting the skin together to form a weighted warm blanket. It kept me warm on those lonely nights. Kept me sane kept me from going over the rail. The enemy thought they had wiped us all out, so they advanced to where i was. The skin blanket was a perfect cover, what they saw was grotesque, I had muffled reactions, some of them throwing up. That gave me the jump on them. With nothing but knife in hand I cut through over a dozen of those bastards for my fallen comrades. Then I advanced forward with the mission. Tales spread far and wide about the SkinnerMaster, wearer of skins, a mission that was supposed to last 3 weeks with 12 soldiers, only took 1 week. With one soldier. The Skinner Master, a man of many faces. 

I was awarded with medals and a big check, but the voices of my men still echoed in my head. I was a mess, no matter how much clothing I had on I was still cold. My wife Doreen was the only one who kept me home. Instead of staying in bed with me all day, she'd wake up and do chores and get my daughter ready for school. So I tried proposing a deal, she'd just give me her skin. For warmth, she called me a freak and we had an altercation which ended up with me covered in her skin keeping me warm all day long. I slept better, started working out. I needed something to rid the smell, so I tried bleaching it. The police rammed through my door after a few days. I was stupid enough to neglect my daughter who saw everything. But now, now the cold has my bones shaking. I need my Doreen. I need her skin.

The text ended there.

Dez had attached another message at the bottom.

"That's your grandfather. I found this journal in Nathan's room. To add fuel to the fire, during our interaction my incantation was in Latin. I'll translate *" Exi ergo, transgressor. Exi seductor, plene plene omni dolo et fallacia virtutis inimici innocentium persecutor"* *(Depart therefore, thou transgressor. Depart thou seducer, totally filled with cunning and deceit, Ohh thou enemy of virtue, thou persecutor of innocent )* 

His response was *"La Diablo etsas vivanta ene di mia korpo! (The devil is living in my flesh) Mi sangas pro la vundoj de inferaj trancxoji (I bleed from the wounds of hellish knives)"*

Also *"Ni vekigu la lordon de la abismo" (Let us awoken the lord of the abyss)*
*"Mia nomo estas Legio cxar ni estas multaj" (My name is Legion for we are many)*

Guess, what. These phrases were written in the back of the journal.  It's Spanish not Latin, I ran the words from the video on a bunch on Google translate. You know what this mean right? . Nathan killed Anne on purpose. He killed 2 more from his class. I had from his classmates that 2 students who rejected him in the past disappeared. I'm afraid they're with Anne.

This information sent my head on a spiral.
