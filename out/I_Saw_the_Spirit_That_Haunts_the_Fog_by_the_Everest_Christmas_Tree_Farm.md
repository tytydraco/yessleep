I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I gripped the steering wheel tightly, my knuckles turning as white as the surroundings were.



I had taken this route so many times before, but tonight seemed different. Maybe it was that I was alone this time, maybe it was because the fog was thicker than I had ever seen it. All this, coupled with the snow it made it so much worse to try and see anything. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. I tried to ignore the feeling and continued on. I was always a bit stubborn and I was determined to make it home with my prize, before it got even harder to see.



I pushed forward, ignoring the little voice in my head telling me to turn back. I had to get back home with the damn tree. Every year it was tradition to go to the Everest Christmas tree farm and get a tree for the family. I lived the closest, but I really did not like going. I was not sure why, but I just did not like the place, something unnerved me about it since I was a kid. Unfortunately, I was the only one who could get the tree back to my parent's place this time. Because of the snow and the timing, I had to go alone. What was worse is that I was late leaving work and it was the last day to get the tree and trim it before Christmas. I would be lucky to get there in time before they closed. Though I admit I was a bit scared for some reason going alone, I was thankful that my family was not with me in this blizzard, if something happened it would just be me who suffered.



I made a bit more progress but my heart sank as I heard a terrible sound coming from the engine. My car suddenly sputtered and came to a halt, the engine had died. I let out a frustrated sigh and checked my phone, but there was no signal. I was completely alone, stranded on an icy, deserted road in the middle of the night.



I stepped out of my car and into the freezing fog, the cold and damp air wrapping around me like a shroud. I could barely see a few feet in front of me, and the only sound was the crunch of ice and snow underfoot.



I started walking, hoping to find a phone signal or at least a house where I could ask for help. This area was sparsely populated and even if someone's house was here, I could barely see it in the haze of white and fog. I thought I might not be too far away from the tree farm, but could not be sure. The fog seemed to grow even thicker as I walked, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched.



As I trudged on, my thoughts began to drift to memories of my past. Memories of the years I had come here before. I started feeling a strange sense of dread, I remembered every year we would arrive, we would always look at the tree’s closest to the farm. It was a large farm and plenty of trees were available, but I always looked near a taller hill in the back of the farm and saw larger trees beyond. The ones further back were technically part of the tree farm as well, but my parents always told us not to go that far back, we could get lost in the tall, densely packed trees.



I shuddered as I started to see tall trees in the path and I remembered vague details about a certain year. My brother and I did not listen to the rule and went to go play in the trees near the hill. I remembered getting lost, my brother and I got separated and then I saw...... something, something in the trees I could not recall. All I could remember was it scared me.



I pushed the memory aside and focused on the present. I walked on and saw the snow-covered sign indicating, “Everest Christmas Tree Farm” I had made it and I thought maybe if they were still open, they could help me get a tree and get help to fix my car.



I walked up to the main building where they normally sold the pre prepared tree’s and to my dismay I saw no one around. I looked by the adjacent house and around the grounds of the farm and did not see anyone. There were not even any parked vehicles in the driveway and I was starting to worry that the place was abandoned and everyone had left somewhere. I slumped my shoulders and tried to decide if I should keep looking or try someplace else. It was getting even colder and I could not stay out here all night to wait. As I considered what to do, I noticed the freezing fog begin to thicken and intensify and it seemed to be following me specifically.



Suddenly, I heard a faint whisper in the fog. It sounded like my name, and it made my blood run cold. I stopped in my tracks and looked around, but I couldn't see anyone. I tried to brush it off as my imagination, but the feeling of being watched only intensified.



I quickened my pace, my heart pounding faster with each step. The fog seemed to be closing in on me, as if it was trying to swallow me whole. I could feel the panic rising in my chest, and I just wanted to get out of there. I started running past the main buildings and through rows of frosted trees, it was chasing me. The fog forced me to press on and I got to the edge of the main farm grounds and saw the ghostly images of trees standing silent on the hill above.



I stopped and felt an irrational wave of terror course through me. I did not want to go up that hill into the tall trees beyond. Something was out there, some half-remembered horror that I could not recall. I looked behind me and thought I might have escaped the nebulous grasp of the frigid fog, but then I saw a figure emerge from the vapors surrounding the trees on the hill. It was a woman, dressed in a tattered white dress, her dark hair hanging in tangled strands around her face. She had a serene and otherworldly beauty, but there was something unsettling about her. I realized that what terrified me was that I remembered her face. All of the sudden I felt like a child again,



I tried to turn and run, but my legs wouldn't move. I was frozen in place, unable to look away from the woman. She seemed to float towards me, her feet not even touching the ground.



As she got closer, I could see that her eyes were black and empty, and a chill ran down my spine. She stopped in front of me and whispered my name again, her voice like a soft hiss.



I finally found my voice and managed to stammer out, "Who are you?"



The woman just smiled, a hauntingly beautiful smile, and pointed up the hill.



I felt a cold hand grip my heart, and I could feel the fear consuming me. I had always been skeptical of ghosts and the supernatural, but in that moment, I knew there was no denying their existence.



The woman's smile turned into a sinister grin, and she reached out to touch me. I closed my eyes, expecting to feel her icy hand on my skin, but instead, I felt a sudden gust of wind and a loud crash of thunder.



When I opened my eyes, the woman was gone, and I was standing in the middle of a clearing surrounded by ancient looking trees. The fog had dissipated, and the moon shone down on me, casting an eerie light on the surroundings.



I looked at my arms and legs and I was a kid again. In fact, I remembered the outfit I was wearing I felt lost and out of place. Then I remembered I was lost; this was when I had gotten lost in the trees on the hill above the farm. My parents were looking for me, this was some sort of memory I was living through again. I felt alone and terrified, the memory came rushing back and the fear was as palpable as it was back then.



I tried to make sense of it all, but before I could process anything, I heard a voice behind me.



"Help me...... remember" the voice said.



I turned around and saw the ghosts. They were everywhere, floating around me in a haze of mist and fog. Some were whispering my name, while others appeared to be in pain or angry.



The nightmare image of the ethereal forms dancing and cavorting through the air was too much and I turned and fled. The terror compelled me to run but I felt a sudden weight in my steps and I slowed to a stop. I looked back and saw the ghostly form of the woman again.



She stared at me and pointed again, further up the hill and floated before me in silent judgment, never uttering a word. Memories flooded back, but this time, they were clearer. They brought understanding and a sense of purpose. I finally remembered.



I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, all the while feeling the ghost's presence leading me on. Then I saw it, the clearing in the forest. I remembered it well, despite trying to deny the memory and suppress its very existence. My body trembled as I looked down, just as I did so many years ago. It was then that I saw her, again. Her body being slowly buried in a small clearing in the forest on the hill. I saw her long hair laying on the ground, saw her lifeless eyes staring at me cowering behind a nearby tree. I saw an outstretched arm and heard the slow, methodical digging of a large faceless man slowly burying her in an unmarked grave.



The full weight of the memory came back to me and made me reel with the potency of it. I had seen her there. I saw her there and never said anything. I was terrified, too afraid of getting in trouble for getting lost. Too afraid of finding something I shouldn't have and most of all, too afraid if that man found out I told someone. I saw it all in silent terror and I never told anyone.



I blinked my eyes and I was back to my own body, at least my body in the correct time. I knew what I had to do. I claimed a shovel from the tool shed near the farmhouse and trudged up the frozen hill in silence. The spectral aura of the spirit never leaving the periphery of my vision. I traced a path I had no idea I remembered. I found the small clearing and I took the shovel in hand and started digging. It was not long before I had found her, what was left of her after all these years. I looked up in shame at the terrible face of the spirit. She did not look angry, she just looked thoughtful. She nodded to me and the heavy fog enveloped her and she vanished before my eyes.



The snowfall had lessened and the fog had begun to clear up as well. I reverently covered the bones and marked the spot they rested in. I started back down the hill and thought of the man I had seen burying the body back then. I could not recall his face, but it made me think of a big story I had heard about on the news a few years ago. I vaguely remembered hearing about a man arrested in this county for the murder of several women who had gone missing. They never found all of the women, but I realized I had likely found one of his victims back when I was a child.



I had a call to make to the police, I knew that someone, somewhere had gone missing and maybe if their families could have closure, it would be enough for the spirit to find some peace. I returned to my car and the desolate road. I turned the key and the car sprang to life. I don’t know how it had started working again. Suddenly my phone was ringing. I answered it and heard my mom’s worried voice on the other end.



"Where are you? we have been trying to call you for hours." I told her the truth; I had been held up by the weather. I apologized and told her I could not get a tree, but I was safe and, on the way, back now.



I looked around and saw that the fog had lifted, and the storm had passed. It was as if nothing had happened.



As I drove home, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace and relief wash over me. And as I looked back at the road, I hoped that I would never be afraid of that place again.
