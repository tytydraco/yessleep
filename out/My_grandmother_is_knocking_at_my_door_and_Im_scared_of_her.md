It was the middle of the night when I suddenly woke up. I could not understand what caused me to wake up though. I lived with my father and grandmother in a big mansion. A month had passed since my parents had separated. For last few months, their relationship was on its worst, with fights becoming a commonplace. We all knew that separation was the only way out. Nevertheless, the thought of my mom not being there for me still haunted me. I would wake up at odd times of the night, the memories of being alone flooding all over me. While my father and grandmother did try their best to make me feel safe and loved and comfortable, I still missed her. I still missed my mom. 


As I woke up suddenly from my sleep, I thought it was the same thing again. My anxiety and loneliness coming to haunt me. But somehow, I felt different. It wasn’t sadness that was gripping me, but rather an uncomfortable silence in the house. My senses told me something was off. Instinctively, I began walking towards my grandmother’s room. My grandmother was sick. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia few years back. While her condition had been deteriorating day by day, the last few months had seen her condition worsen drastically. She behaved erratically and sleep walked occasionally. I heard a faint mumble in the distance. Someone was singing a lullaby somewhere in our house. 


I looked both sides and stepped out of my room. Just beside my bedroom door, there stood a grandfather clock, which showed the time. 2:55 a.m. I hated this time of the night. I had heard many stories about haunting experiences occurring at 3 a.m. I stood at the edge of the stairs looking down. It was pitch dark. My father lived just across my room and my grandmother lived just next to his room. I stared at their rooms and saw that the door to my grandmother's room was slightly open. I walked slowly to her door and opened it carefully. The room was dark but there was a faint ray of moonlight entering the room. There was a rocking chair right where the moonlight stopped. My grandmother was sitting in the chair, rocking to-and-fro. She was humming a lullaby and holding something in her hand. I could also hear a little squeaking noise. I went close to her and stood directly beside her. 


My grandmother was holding a rat in her hand and humming to it. I knew this was another episode of Her’s. I shook her by holding her shoulder. She looked at me and smiled. She then looked at the rat and, in an instant, she began chewing on it. There was blood splattered all over her white dress. I was shocked seeing it. I had never seen her behave like this before. Suddenly, she threw the remains of the rat and sprung at me. I started screaming at the top of my lungs as she held my throat. My father was in the next room oblivious to whatever was happening to me. My grandma was chocking me and humming her lullaby. I could feel my eyes bulging. Suddenly, I heard a noise and realised it was my father. Somehow, he had woken up from his sleep and miraculously had rushed in to help me. My grandma was still on top of me when my father tried to pull her off. She held on to me with a strength that I hadn’t imagined. Somehow, my father managed to separate us. Grandma just stood up and looked at my dad with bloodshot eyes. She suddenly began convulsing and fell to the floor. 


My dad hurriedly picked me up first, then we both checked on her. She was shaking uncontrollably and making weird noises. Her face started contusing and her limbs started twisting. Her bones were crunching, and they made cracking noises. Suddenly, she stood on all fours and began running. She ran towards the door, through the dark stairs and ran out of the door. We only heard a noise of the front door opening. My dad immediately dialled 911. The cops came to our house and we filed a missing person report. They tried asking her about what happened. We never told them what did. How could we? We could not understand ourselves. The cops searched her for days, but to no avail. 


This happened three days ago. Today, I was sleeping in my bedroom and watching a Netflix show. I was lying on the bed. One of my legs was folded and the other leg was on top of it. From the gap between my legs, I could see the bathroom door. While watching the movie, I noticed something. I could see a face peeking out of the bathroom and smiling at me. I instantly who it was. It was grandma. She started humming that creepy lullaby again. Without wasting any time, I sprung from my bed and rushed to my father’s room and locked the door from inside. My father woke up immediately. I explained everything to him and he called the cops once again. Right now, my grandmother is banging on the door. We are waiting for the police to arrive. I am writing this post from my father’s room hoping someone could tell me what’s wrong with her. If anyone knows what’s happening, please tell me.
