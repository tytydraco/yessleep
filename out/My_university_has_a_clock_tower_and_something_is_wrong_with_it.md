What makes university life so difficult? Is it the crushing weight of student fees? The never-ending stream of assignments that seem custom-designed to drive us mad? Or perhaps it’s the professors who, with their monotone voices and dreary PowerPoint slides, could turn even the most curious minds into half-asleep zombies?

Honestly—yes. All of the above.

But here's the twist: there are some (undeniably crazy) people who don't see those as the hardest parts of university life. Rich kids don’t worry about tuition. Brainiacs breeze through assignments. Some professors actually make learning enjoyable. So what, then, is the great equalizer?

The answer, I’d argue, is the environment. And by that, I don’t mean social environment—I’m talking about the physical campus itself.

It’s a mess. A disorganized, oddly structured, geographically absurd mess. And I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one who feels this way.

Our university suffers from three major spatial problems. The first: it’s not centralized. While the main cluster of buildings—the library, cafeteria, and various academic blocks—sit relatively close together, some of our other facilities are randomly scattered across the city. You’ll spot our campus logo on obscure buildings in the strangest corners of town. I still remember one semester when I had a history lecture… located between a medical clinic and a cinema. Yes, really. History.

Second: the “main street.” This is where most of the action happens—several buildings, all arranged in a loose square. Each side hosts its own cafeteria and lecture halls. Seems efficient, right? Not quite. Because my classes aren’t confined to just one block, I constantly find myself passing through what is arguably the weirdest structure on campus: the Clock Tower.

Let’s talk about the third problem, the Clock Tower.

Old. Cold. Eerie. Deceiving.

Yes, it *technically* has a clock on top. Yes, it functions. But every two hours, it plays *“My Country, ‘Tis of Thee.”* The melody—famously repurposed by Britain—rings out like a national anthem for the damned. Worse still, at night, the bells toll with a haunting resonance that brings to mind propaganda broadcasts from North Korea—blaring hollow melodies through decrepit speakers. It’s not just unsettling. It’s hellish.

But what’s inside is even worse.

The interior resembles something out of Dracula’s castle—dim, sterile, and eerily silent. There are no posters, no flyers, no signs of student life. Though lectures do happen in some rooms, the place feels less like a university building and more like an abandoned estate. And we’re not the only ones who think so.

Homeless people agree.

Let me be clear. When I say “homeless,” I’m not just referring to unfortunate victims of circumstance. In our city, the term often describes a collection of drug addicts, perverts, and unstable individuals who’ve long lost any semblance of societal norms. Many of them are dangerous—my father, a police officer, once witnessed a colleague stabbed to death by one such person.

Now imagine them walking freely onto campus.

Our university essentially operates like a city district. There’s no perimeter lockdown, no emergency protocol for intruders. Security personnel patrol, yes, but beyond that, it’s every student for themselves.

The clock tower uses a keycard system. During the day—from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.—it remains unlocked, allowing public entry. But once 6 hits, only students and staff with valid IDs can access the tower.

Or leave it.

Despite that system, no one really knows what happens in the clock tower after hours. Rumors circulate—about homeless people sneaking in, locking students inside with them, mugging or harassing them. Yet, there’s never been an official report from the administration. Just whispers. Just speculation.

We say, *“The homeless lurk in the clock tower at night.”* But we never *see* it. No evidence. No testimonies. Just eerie silence.

That day, I was planning to explore the club scene for next semester. The university was hosting an expo across three different locations: the main square, the western district, and the far north. It was a big deal—students buzzing with energy, council members making announcements, even cops on standby to ensure no rules were broken.

I spent nearly two hours wandering through the crowd, checking out booths. Eventually, I ran into James, a close friend, and Adam—the student council president, and a mutual acquaintance of ours. The three of us decided to grab dinner.

Our destination: the pizzeria on the west side of the main block. In a campus with cafeterias on every corner, it’s the small places that hit differently. And that one—despite its chipped tiles and flickering lights—was always warm, always comforting. One of the few places on campus that didn’t feel haunted.

For once, it felt like we weren’t running from shadows.

Being a university campus, cafeterias are scattered all over the place, offering a surprisingly wide variety of food. The spot the three of us visited most often was a small pizzeria tucked away on the west side of the main block.

Dinner conversations tended to start light—daily routines, frustrations, and minor triumphs—but as usual, our discussion began to drift. That night, it gradually evolved into talk about philosophy, nihilism, and the nature of evil. Eventually, the conversation took a turn toward a peculiar rumor: that homeless individuals had been sneaking onto campus grounds at night.

To our surprise, this rumor seemed to hold some truth. Adam mentioned that he had once seen a homeless man entering a campus building just before it closed. James backed the story up, saying he’d once witnessed a homeless man being escorted out by staff.

Almost every time this came up, it was always the same building we were referring to: the clock tower.

Adam and James, in their usual mischievous tone, said they planned to “abuse their powers”—meaning, they wanted to sneak into the clock tower at night and somehow keep homeless people out. I wished them luck and wrapped up my meal, then headed off to the expo to help the club leaders pack up their materials as closing time approached.

Once the cleanup was done, I made my way to the bus stop, which would take me to the ferry headed toward home. But just as I was about to leave the central square, something caught my eye.

For a brief second, I saw someone—a total stranger—wandering near the clock tower. And not just near it. Inside. If I had to be precise, it looked like the stereotypical image of a homeless man standing within the tower itself.

If what James and Adam had said was true, maybe this was my chance to be on their side. Honestly, I also just wanted to see for myself—maybe that stranger was just a poorly dressed staff member. The door was still open during the last few minutes of public access, so I figured I’d take a quick look around before it locked for the night. (Not that it mattered much. I could still unlock it with my student card.)

The moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by the familiar, unpleasant odor that always seemed to cling to the clock tower—though at night, it was even more pronounced. The place looked duller than usual, stripped of its already limited charm. With most of its light coming from the windows during the day, the tower at night was reduced to a handful of dim lights meant only to prevent total darkness.

It almost felt like the school was unintentionally inviting people in with that kind of half-hearted illumination.

I decided to look for the man I had seen.

He was nowhere to be found—but something told me it was still worth searching further.

Despite its name, the clock tower wasn’t especially tall. Just three stories. The ground floor was mostly administrative: registration, the infirmary, counselors, reception—places the general public frequented. The other two floors were lecture rooms, with subjects that rotated regularly, just like most classrooms on campus.

There was an elevator, but it was restricted and—like tonight—usually out of order.

The clock tower was built at a low elevation, nestled within naturally-formed stone walls. Because of this unique architecture, there are two accessible entry points: one at the ground level and another at the middle floor. I entered through the latter while chasing the man.

I stood motionless inside, trying to detect any trace of human activity. Although the tower rises three stories, its compact size allows even the faintest of man-made sounds—footsteps, keyboard tapping—to travel easily between floors.

But it was silent.

Deathly silent.

The only thing I could hear was the soft rhythm of my own breath.

I began to wander aimlessly, unsure of what I was even searching for. Just as I turned to leave, something made me freeze.

A noise.

A meow echoed through the tower. It wasn’t ominous or unnatural—just a cat. Or so I thought. The echo bounced through the narrow stone corridors and halted me in my tracks. But what truly unsettled me was the cat itself, now sitting right behind me, staring at me with golden eyes.

The cat looked up at me, curious and still. I wondered briefly if it belonged to the man I had been following, but the thought didn’t trouble me. Not yet.

That changed when I looked down.

Paw prints trailed across the dusty floor. They were unmistakably feline… but red. Not a trick of the light. Not mud. Blood.

I gently scooped the cat up, wary of its claws, and immediately felt the sticky texture of dried blood on its paws. There was a fresh wound on its back leg as well. The cat squirmed violently in my arms, forcing me to release it. It hit the ground with a thud and bolted up the stairs, wailing the entire way.

And it left a fresh trail of bloody paw prints in its wake.

I followed them up to the next floor, thinking the cat needed help. This time, I moved carefully, not wanting to scare it off again. Its trail led me clearly—there were no corners to hide in, just a direct line forward.

But the footprints didn’t stop.

They continued—up another set of stairs.

I froze.

There is only one staircase in the tower that connects all the floors. Ground, middle, and top. That’s all. I knew this well. But here, before me, was a different staircase entirely. One I had never seen before.

It led upward… to a door.

To the roof?

That couldn’t be. The roof of the clock tower was inaccessible without a ladder, always requiring maintenance staff to bring one in. But here I was, staring at a staircase I knew *shouldn’t* exist.

And the cat’s bloody prints ended right in front of the door.

I approached slowly and pushed it open. Darkness.

Not darkness as in night—this wasn’t just a lack of sunlight. It was pitch black. A void. There were no environmental lights, no stars. It was clear I hadn’t stepped outside. This was something else entirely.

I pulled out my phone and switched on the flashlight.

The beam revealed a barren, dusty room. It looked like a storage space—but it was empty. Completely.

Still searching for the cat, I swept my light across the corners, where cats often hide.

What I found was not a cat.

I nearly dropped my phone.

Before me was a creature—on all fours, yes—but unmistakably *wrong*. Hairless, its muscles exposed like raw meat, with none of the grace or familiarity of a feline.

And it was feeding.

It was hunched over a human body, tearing into flesh with methodical hunger. The clothing on the corpse suggested it was someone homeless, someone unfortunate enough to seek shelter here.

The creature paused, then turned toward me.

I froze.

Its face was grotesque: vaguely feline, but distorted—human teeth, a long tail, eyes that glowed with a cruel curiosity.

And it stared.

Each time it moved, I heard cracking sounds, like the snapping of wood in an old puppet. Then it stopped moving altogether, as if considering me.

That’s when more of them emerged from the shadows.

Identical. Catlike in posture. Human in face. All grinning with the same grotesque smile. Many of their faces resembled the elderly… and I realized with horror that I recognized one of them—the very man I had chased into this place.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to vomit. But I couldn’t.

They began to move toward me. Slowly, deliberately.

I turned back to the door I had come through—only to find it gone. Where the doorway had been, there was now only a solid wall.

I was trapped.

Even without seeing them, I *felt* the creatures behind me, inching closer. Every instinct told me being caught meant a fate worse than death.

I bolted.

Somehow, in the dark, I found another door. A thin strip of light glowed beneath it—hope. Maybe I had panicked and run the wrong way before. Maybe this was the exit I’d meant to find.

I threw myself at the door, using all my strength.

And then—freefall.

I was falling—not from the rooftop, but through the interior of the clock tower. As if I had dropped from the ceiling of the ground floor itself. As if the room had spat me out.

—

They found me unconscious on the ground floor. I had suffered a severe concussion, according to the doctors. It was the students who discovered me that called for help.

When I woke up, my father was beside me, looking pale with worry. The doctors insisted I stay for observation. No other major injuries, just the head trauma. I remained in the hospital for three days.

On my mother’s advice, I stayed home to recover for the rest of the week.

But something gnawed at me.

There were no reports. No mentions of blood. No acknowledgment of what I’d seen. Just a single student collapsed.

And yet, I remember falling.

I *remember* the blood. The room. The creatures.

I never spoke of it to my parents.

But three days after I was found, two students—James Wood and Adam Lee—disappeared.

They were the ones who first told me about the tower.

Witnesses said they were last seen entering it.

That was three months ago.

No trace of them has been found. No bodies. No clues. And that mysterious staircase? Gone. Just a blank wall where it once stood.

I’ve returned to the clock tower once since then, only to find nothing. No stairs. No hidden rooms. No doors.

Adam and James are still missing.

And I have a terrible feeling. I know what happened to them.

Since that day, I haven’t stepped foot near the tower.

And I never will again.

I’ll take the long way. Always.
