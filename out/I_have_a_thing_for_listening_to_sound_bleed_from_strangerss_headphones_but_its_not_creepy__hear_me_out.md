The circle line is the best place to find them. The perpetually repeating train loop provides a steady flow of them throughout the day without having to change platforms or carriage. I know the hot spots (nothing too genius, any middle carriage would do) to guarantee at least one that matches my needs perfectly walks on. Blonde haired, blue eyed women, lost in the music they’re listening to on their headphones.   
  
They have to be blonde, they have to be blue eyed. And they need to be listening to music.   
  
I don’t care if you make any allusions to this being a Freudian thing because I’m well aware it relates back to my mother. You don’t need to ask me about my childhood to send me on a reverie back to those long days and nights. I’m in my thirties but sometimes I feel like I’m still there, being a sickly child, a confined convalescent in my bed, listening to the muted melodies of my mother’s headphones as she worked around me, tidied the room, entered, re-entered, fed me, consoled me, ignored me, heard me, hated me. Those headphones were how she made her imprisoned life with me bearable. Lost in her music, she didn’t feel alone.   
  
Me and her. Me, pining for her company, her pining for anyone’s but mine.   
  
She never failed to meet my physical needs so I have never hated her for hating me. But I would have done anything to have her beautiful blue eyes truly see me. See me as more than a burden. Yet every glance from her betrayed her thinly veiled resentment and sense of incarceration.  
  
It was in my twenties when I realised I had a thing for that. You know, how sore the subdued sounds trickling out of the headphones of a beautiful blonde woman left me. I noted repeatedly how being in the presence of stray notes from their headphones sent my heart racing, my jaw aching, my calves clenching, and my toes curling. I’d grit my teeth because it was both painful and so pleasurable. It wasn’t hard for me to quickly determine the link to my blonde mother.   
  
Before you ask, no, its not a sexual thing. It is an offence for you to even suggest that. It implies the greatest sensory experience a man can have is sexual, and that is where you would be wrong, and I pity you for not knowing otherwise.  
   
So I wait for the next one to come on the Tube. I’ve learnt over the years to pick strangers: you can’t pull it off with people you know. For one, they wouldn’t be sitting with music in their ears in your company, and you wouldn’t want to get a reputation for being odd. They wouldn’t understand. But also… going for strangers heightens the pain component of the yin-yang dance of pleasure and pain. The transient nature of sharing a carriage with you, with no idea when they’ll get off, when you’ll see them again – that, that, drives me absolutely wild.   
  
I need them to have blue eyes as I’ve mentioned. I don’t even mind if they close their eyes whilst they’re listening. In fact, it’s even better when they close them. Because sooner or later they fly open momentarily just to check the station they’re at, and these moments, these precious moments, they’re truly gifts. Cerulean surprises that send jolts through me, their fleeting nature hooking me in, keeping me despairing for the next hit whilst simultaneously hoping for a longer delay, acutely aware the prolonged crescendo of desperation mixed with pleasure would be deafening.  
  
It doesn’t work with redheads, brunettes, or anyone else. But on slow days, I can close my eyes and just let myself be subtly serenaded by the bleeding notes floating in from anyone, male or female.  I’m a pleasant enough commute-fellow and I’d give you no reason to be concerned. What I’m doing is harmless. That said, I do note I get annoyed with the Muslim passengers. The women cover their hair so there’s no way to tell if they’re blonde, but the most aggravating thing is that they tuck their headphones inside their headscarves so you can’t even hear a single note. It’s selfish.   
  
In any case, I’ve learnt to conduct myself in ways on the Tube that doesn’t cause concern. I have discovered over the years that women are perceptive, hypervigilant even, on public transport. So I can’t be too conspicuous. I’ve seen some pick up artists online that promote ‘negging’ which is where you try and subtly rip into a woman so they feel like they want your approval without them even understanding why. You then use that to lure them in. I’ve adapted this for myself – adaptations necessary as I don’t want to speak to them, and I don’t want to hear their voice. I just want them to stay in their own worlds, lost in their music rather than suspicious to the point they take their headphones off as if to have every sense at their disposal to manage a potentially risky situation. I’m not a perve. And I don’t want to be so intense they leave the carriage suddenly or stop their music. So my adaptation to ‘negging’ is to make sure on our first moment of eye contact, to have a slight frown on my face, sometimes followed by a subtle smirk. That does it. It seems to imply I’m not interested or attracted to them, which lowers their guard, and prevents them feeling disgusted towards me. After a few moments of slightly confused glances at me, they get lost in their own worlds again and I can focus on pretending to read something on my phone but discreetly watch them from the corner of my eye.   
  
I’ve also learnt to smell nice. This lets me stand near them. Lean in slightly during rush hour. Feathers tickling my ear. I sometimes close my eyes to sink into the tunes like a warm bath, expertly guiding my attention to discern the notes coming from the headphones against the noise of the screeching underground and polluting babble of the public sharing the carriage with me and her.   
  
There was a period I used to follow them off the train but competing against the crashing sounds of the outer world rendered the exercise pointless. Plus they ended up walking so fast I couldn’t keep up with them without looking like a creep, which I’m sure you can see I’m anything but. I’m just a man who has found a harmless heroin equivalent for his brain. I steal nothing: I’m simply raptured by what is already spilling into the surroundings. It’s subtle, innocent and I would argue wholesome. Perhaps without even realising it you’ve already met me and provided me great aural pleasure at no cost to you. Can you imagine that? You’ve made someone so blissfully happy without even realising it!  
  
Ah perfect. Another one has come on, just as I was feeling the itch. She’s wearing a bobble hat, which obscures a lot of her hair, but it’s okay as her hair is long enough for gold tendrils to fall around her shoulders. I hold my breath, praying for her to sit near me and she does. I adopt a slight frown, a grimace as our eyes meet and I look away.   
  
It is done. In a few minutes I will be able to enjoy her without causing alarm.
