Two weeks ago I moved to my new apartment and I love it! I love the large windows, I love the enormous living room, and I love how every little appliance is connected to the internet. It really is a smart house - smarter than some people I know. I wouldn't say I like the paintings on the walls, but they are growing on me. I'm not allowed to remove them anyway.

Generally speaking, it's a huge improvement compared to the shit hole where I used to live in the last few years. I certainly won't miss the huge rats that visited me a couple of times a week. I tried calling one of them Remy after the rat from Ratatouille, but it didn't make things any better. I hated living there. Dropping out of college just like Steve Jobs did, wasn't one of my brightest ideas, and earning minimum wage as a truck driver for a small furniture workshop left me with little choice. I could hardly make rent for this dump.

I found out about this new apartment through a text I received.

"Do you believe you deserve good things? Are you a believer?” it said.

At first, I thought it was a spam message. I get a lot of those. I get A LOT of spam messages lately. I suspect that my crazy ex signed me up for every spam she could find: penis enlargement treatments, special offers at the local store, and just plain scams. I got it all. So I simply ignored it, but the messages just kept coming.

"Aren't you sick of living in your shit hole?” they said”, “ You can do better. You have to believe!”,

"It's time to make a change! Believe in yourself!”, “We are waiting for you. Just say yes!”

When I blocked one number, they would send texts from another. They just wouldn't give up. So... I decided to play along, just for fun.

"Oh, wow...” I replied, “This sounds great.”

They replied immediately. They WERE waiting for me! We kept texting and pretty soon it seemed real to me. I wasn't just having fun anymore. I believed I could do better.  
They gave me an address and told me that the apartment was unlocked. If I wanted to have a look, I could come over any time, so I did.  
About an hour after I checked it out, they finally called.

“Hello, Moe?” they said.

“Yes... Hi...” I said.

“So what do you think?”

“It's great, but I'm pretty sfure I can't afford it.”

“1$ for the first month, and after that we'll work something out.”

"Are you kidding?” I asked.

“I like you, you seem like a decent guy.”

"I'm a decent guy? I might be a psychotic murderer as far as you know.”

"Even better.” he replied, and a few seconds later, "Just kidding. I have a sense for this kind of thing. Trust me.”

I couldn't tell why at the time, but I did trust him. I really did.

I know what you must be thinking:  
“The apartment was haunted.”  
“The owner wanted me to move in so he could kill me and then eat me.”  
“There was a portal to hell in the bathroom!”  
You couldn't be more wrong!  
This apartment is fantastic, I'm alive and well and doing better than ever.  
I didn't even have to sign the contract with my blood.

Anyway...  
The other night, I think it was the next day after I moved in, I was cooking dinner when I heard some loud noises coming from next door. It sounded like horrible music played by a terrible band, and it was loud. OH SO FUCKING LOUD.

“So that's why the rent was so low.” I mumbled, “I better start looking for a new place...”

After a few minutes when this awful noise just wouldn't stop, I decided to go and ask my new neighbor to turn the volume down, in a nice way, of course. I was a nice guy. I walked over to my neighbor's door and knocked three times.  
The noise stopped immediately.  
I smiled and turned away from the door when it opened just a little bit.  
A little blond girl, not older than 12 years old, stood there and looked at me.

"Can I help you?” she asked.

"I just wanted to ask you to keep the noise down.” I smiled.

"Noise?” she seemed confused, “oh, you mean our music. No, we can't do that.”

She tried to close the door, but I put my foot in.

"What do you mean 'we can't do that'? “ I yelled, “Do I have to call the police?”

"Don't waste your time.” she said with a sinister grin, “We'll be done in an hour or two.”

“Are your parents home?” I asked.

"Fuck off, you little bitch” she said and tried to shut the door on my foot.

"Are they home?” I asked and tried to stay as calm as I could.

"Yes,” she said.

"Call them. Now, please.”

"No.”

At this point, I was absolutely furious. I seriously considered pushing her out of the way and barging into her apartment.

"Oh no... you don't want to do that.” she said as if she knew exactly what I was thinking.

A door across the hall suddenly opened and an older gentleman came out and slowly walked towards us. Something about his face wasn't quite right. In the dim light, it looked more like a mask of a face than an actual face.

"Hello, you must be Moe.” he said.

"And you are?” I barked at him.

"I am Gor, your landlord.” he said quietly, “Do not yell at me.”

"Don't worry, old man.” I said, “I'll be out of here soon enough.”

He put his hand on the little girl's shoulder, pulled her away, and whispered to her something that I couldn't hear.

"Him?” she giggled, “You must be kidding me.”

"Angelica!” Gor frowned at the girl, “Apologize to Mr. Moe”.

"I'm sorry, Mr. Moe.” she said.

"The music will stop now.” Gor said and turned to go back to his apartment.

“He's not even a believer!” Angelica shouted angrily.

"Neither were you.” we could hear him say before he closed his door.

"Good night, Angelica.” I said and was delighted to see her smug face disappearing behind the door.

I went back to my place and as soon as I sat down on the sofa...

"O LA KOMO RAK!”

I heard voices coming from behind the wall.

"O LA KOMO RAK! DO RO FIL MO RAK!”

I could hear about ten voices chanting this nonsense together.  
“God damn it! SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I shouted, hoping the assholes behind the wall would hear me. I started banging on the wall again and again but then somebody knocked on MY door.  
Tired and agitated I answered the door. It was that little bitch, Angelica.  
"Stop banging on the wall!” she said and turned to walk away.

"O LA KOMO RAK! DO RO FIL MO RAK!”

This time this voice came from inside my head.  
"Stop the chanting!” I yelled, but she just gave me the finger and went away.  
"La la komo la...” I sang quietly as I closed my door. That day was absolutely exhausting; I only wanted to crawl into bed with a good book and fall asleep.  
I didn't hear any of the chanting or “music” for the rest of that night.

I thought that it was the end of it.

And then I woke up with a bloody knife in my hand.  
I'm not saying that it would have bothered me today, but it sure bothered me that morning.  
I had no idea what I had done or how I got hold of that knife, but I was sure that the red sticky stuff on its blade was blood.  
I dropped the knife on the floor and rushed to wash my hands in the bathroom but when I looked at the mirror I was shocked to see the words “FIL MO RAK” carved into my forehead. It looked like an old scar and not something that happened last night.

It was that little bitch, Angelica! I was sure of it. She did this to me! I had no idea how she could pull that off, enter my apartment, or carve those words on my forehead without waking me up, but I was sure it was her fault.  
I grabbed the knife and walked towards her apartment.

"Open the door!” I screamed, “O LA KOMO RAK I'll kick it down!”

A few seconds later, the door opened and Angelica stood at the doorway. She was smiling at me.

“Look what you did!” I screamed and held my knife to her throat.

“Good morning, Mr. Moe.” she said.

“WHY?” I screamed closely in her ear, “WHY?”

“This is what the good book orders us to do.” she said, smiling like a drunk priest,

“Put down the knife. I'm a believer just like you.”

“You're insane!” I said, “Where are your parents?”

“They're inside.” she said, “They're waiting for you.”

I pushed her out of the way and looked around. The apartment looked pretty much like mine, only this one had about 100 men and women sitting on the floor, holding hands and I was pretty sure they were praying for something. Something that was obviously not the god you know.

“We were all waiting for you.” a voice came from behind me. It was Gor. This time I was sure his face was indeed a mask and for some reason, I didn't want to know what was behind it.

“Did you read the good book?” he asked.

“Of course he did!” Angelica laughed, “He has the blood of the nonbelievers on his knife!”

She pointed at the knife I was holding, “Look, everyone! O LA KOMO RAK!”

"O LA KOMO RAK!” said the people on the floor, who were now looking at me with their black eyes.

"I DIDN'T MURDER ANYONE!” I shouted in despair, “LEAVE ME ALONE!”

And then it came back to me. I remembered what happened that night. That strange book on my desk... Those weird images... The screaming from below... That homeless person in that alley... That awful music that kept playing in my head! The BLOOD! OH MY GOD, THE BLOOD! O LA KOMO RAK!”

"Of course, you didn't murder anyone. We don't consider it murder.” Gor put a comforting hand on my shoulder, “Nonbelievers are... not... they are not... it's not murder.”

"Are you serious?” I asked.

“Dead serious.” Gor said and his face twitched as if he was trying to smile.

“Ah, ok.” I said. Wow, that was a relief.

“So, what do you want from me?” I said.

“As I told you when I offered you this apartment, I know you are a decent guy”, Gor said.

“I am a decent guy.” I said to myself. I was pretty proud of myself, “FIL MO RAK! Moe loves RAK!”

"We, the followers of RAK, have prepared for this day since RAK came to the blessed prophet in his dreams. The day of judgment is upon us!”  
  
"Of course, I will join you! Death to the non-believers!” I said with a smile.  
  
I hugged Gor. I hugged Angelica. I hugged every single person in that building.  
I have never felt such love.

So in the past two weeks, I was having the time of my life with my new friends. We were walking in the streets and killing non-believers, you know... it's not murder, because... you know... it's not.  
At the moment, we are still trying to avoid media coverage, disguising our murde... killings as accidents, gang wars, and suicides, but I can assure you it is our doing.  
I don't think I'm supposed to write about it, but in a few weeks, it won't matter anymore.  
We will find and dispose of nonbelievers wherever they live.

We are everywhere.

See you soon.
