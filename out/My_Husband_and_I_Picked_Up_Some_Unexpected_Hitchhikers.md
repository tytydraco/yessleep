I can’t believe I’m doing this. The only thing I ever used this site for was finding new books to read, but I don’t really know what to do. I’ve never been in a situation like this and I could use some advice. 

I’ll start from the beginning. My husband and I went on a brief vacation over two weeks ago to celebrate our four-year wedding anniversary. No one thought we would last, so we wanted to make it special and revisit the town that we met in Abilene, Texas. Everything was perfect. We had a wonderful stay; I spent more money than I needed to and my husband got to visit his old high school friends. Hell, the last day wasn’t even really sad when we had to say goodbye to our friends. We wished them and the town goodbye before we packed up and headed home.

Our eight-hour trip back home.

The drive was mostly uneventful until the end. As the sun set behind the trees, things became unsettling. We passed by a few crashed cars. They were just wrapped around trees or in ditches. What really stood out to me was the fact that there were no police or EMTs at any of the wrecks. I didn’t even see any bodies. I tried to pull over at the first accident I saw, but my husband’s hand wrapped around the steering wheel, stopping me. 

“No, it could be a trap of some kind. There could be people waiting behind the tree-line for someone to stop.” I know what you’re thinking. He’s heartless. It’s the opposite, actually. A couple years back, my sister-in-law disappeared on her way home from a business trip. My husband was on the phone with her when she said she needed to hang up, that there was something blocking the road and she needed to get out of the car and move it out of the way. She promised she would call him back when she was back on the road before hanging up. He never got that call, she’s been missing ever since. The police discovered only her car, the keys were still in the ignition, and her phone was left in the passenger seat with twenty-seven missed calls. Ever since then, my husband and his family have been super nervous about things like this. 

It was hard to drive past all of those cars but we continued on, he turned up the radio and tried to erase the grim sight from our minds.

We were about an hour away from home, driving down old back roads, when I saw something  — well, someone step out into the middle of the road. I eased on the brakes, coming to a slow stop when they didn’t move. I kept my distance, locked the doors, and waited. And waited. And I checked the doors again to make sure they were locked before looking back up, only to find they had disappeared..

“Wait, where did they- SHIT?!” My husband’s confused about making me nearly slam down on the gas pedal. I whipped towards him, ready to tear him a new one, but he wasn’t looking at me but past me, out my window. I followed his gaze to find two small children, no older than seven or eight years old, standing outside my door. One was a little girl with long curly blonde hair and a boy with short brown hair. I couldn’t see their faces; my window tint was too dark. I could tell they were distraught, crying and looking around frantically, as if trying to find someone. I rolled down the window to get a better look at them. They were begging for help, for me to let them in the car, for us to help them. I felt my heart break into a million pieces for them as tears dripped down their pale little faces. I figured that they must be survivors from one of the crashes. Without a word, I unlocked the backseat door. Whoever they were, they needed help, also I figured they could tell me more than once they were out of the dark and cold, once they calmed down some. 

When they did eventually calm down, I looked into the backseat through the rear-view mirror to begin my questioning, but I decided to wait. When I looked back they were fast asleep, wrapped up in a blanket I keep in the back for emergencies, you never know when a blizzard could start. 

“What the hell, Kyren?” I heard my husband question as quietly as he could through grit teeth.

“What? What’s your problem?” I glanced over, not appreciating his tone. I knew exactly where this was going. 

“What’s my problem? Maybe the fact that you pulled over after I just told you to keep driving!” He was furious, almost as furious as the day the police said they never found his sister.

“You can’t be serious, they’re just two kids. I couldn’t just leave them there, who knows what could happen to them out here? I can’t even imagine what they just went through!” I was starting to get annoyed, I was gripping the steering wheel so tight that I could feel my knuckles begin to ache as my nails dug into the faux leather.

“I don’t give a shit if it was just a couple of puppies back there, there could’ve been a group of traffickers waiting to-“

“I don’t give a fuck! I’m not leaving two kids on the side of the road, William! Especially at night! Besides, I only unlocked the back doors. It’s not like I had put the car in park and got out.” We both sat there for a moment, shocked by my outburst. I’ve never raised my voice at anyone like that before, sure I’ve gotten into arguments with him, but I’ve never outright yelled at him or anyone. I just couldn’t take it. He’s never been the most empathetic person, and it’s the only thing I can’t stand.

I couldn’t take it back though and I wasn’t ready to apologize either, so I simply turned up the radio so we didn’t have to finish up the rest of the trip in the awkward silence.

I honestly didn’t even realize I had pulled the car into the driveway until I heard William slam his door shut. My mind was just racing with questions. I shot him a glare for slamming my door before I turned back to wake up the children. To my surprise, they were already awake, the door slamming must have woken them. 

“Come on, let’s head inside. There’s a warm bed and a big guest room with your name written on it. I bet it’s more comfortable than those seats.”

They smiled and followed behind excitedly. I passed my husband, who only shook his head at me as he unpacked our things. I showed them the spare bathroom and laid out some clean clothes for them that I kept around when my nieces and nephews would visit. They would be a little big, but it was better than their wet clothes. I stayed nearby in case they needed anything in the shower before I tucked them into bed and told them where they could find us. 

When I made my way to the bedroom, I didn’t have to turn around to know that William staring at me as I got ready for bed. I simply sat down at my desk, opened my laptop top and began typing before speaking up with: “You can glare at me all you want, I’m not going to apologize for what I said or how I said it. I’m certainly not leaving them outside.”

What he said next surprised me. 

“You’re right. I’m sorry, I would’ve pulled over too if it had been me. You did the right thing. They’re just kids.” It wasn’t just home giving up, he genuinely meant it. “In the morning, we will sit down with them and try to find out more about their parents, see if they know their cell phone numbers. Hopefully, they’re alright and weren’t inside any of the cars we saw.”

If any of you have any suggestions on what we should do or what questions we should ask the kids, please comment below. Nothing like this has ever happened to us before and, as you can tell, we clearly lack kids of our own. I just want to make sure that we cover all our bases.
