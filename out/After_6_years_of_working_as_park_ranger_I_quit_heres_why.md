Hello, this is the story of how I quit my job. This isn't a liberating story of breaking the shackles and going to my dream job. This is a story of leaving a demonic place. I am a Park ranger, It all goes back to 1 week ago. 

I was in my truck taking the usual route around the park until I saw a white van, it wasn't even on the trail. It was just sitting there in the middle of the forest. I called in a 10-92 (illegally parked vehicle). Until my radio went off “10-4, permission to investigate.” I exited my truck and walked toward the van. 

The environment was completely silent, except for my engine still running, and my footsteps which seemed ever so loud. I walked around the van, nothing seemed odd till I got to the other side of the van. I saw a black pentagram spray painted on the van. I started to notice that there were scuff marks and little blemishes here and there. 

I was walking back to my vehicle to call in tow when I heard a roar, It didn't sound like a bear. It sounded like something more demonic. I walked toward the source of the sound. I walked past the van and walked, flashlight in hand. I heard its violent cries again. I pulled my gun out and stood frozen, I heard footsteps zoom behind me. 

I turned around to see nothing… I blew a sigh of relief. Knowing it was all probably in my head. I walked back to my car and called in a tow truck. I looked out into the forest, I noticed two red eyes staring back at me. I blinked and they were gone. I thought it had to be in my head, it had to. 

There's no such thing as monsters repeating in my brain like a broken record. Eventually the tow truck pulled up. The man got out and I got out of my car too. “You look worse for where,” the tow man said. “Lack of sleep” I said, that was somewhat true, I was too embarrassed to say I was terrified. Eventually we hooked up the van and that was that. 

I got in my truck and drove off. That was the end of it, or that’s what I thought. After getting a few complaints and other issues I started to relax again, the only thing that bothered me was I felt like I was being watched. Eventually I came up to a downed tree blocking the path. I checked my GPS and called in “We have a 10-53 at J,28 south east.” Then I heard “10-12, we are sending assistance.” As I got out of my car I walked towards the fallen tree.

 I tried to push it to see if I could make some progress, well I waited for backup. It was useless. I kicked it in frustration. Then I heard it. “Not again” I thought. My heart was racing. SNAP! I twig snapped and I instantly turned around. It was tall and muscular. I raised my flashlight and saw its face. Oh god… the face.

 It had long goat horns and the face of a goat, with dark red eyes. Those eyes… it-it had been following me. I was face to face with the goat man. I dropped my flashlight and ran with a gun in hand. I ran, but I could hear this thing getting closer.

 I knew it would catch me, so I turned around and fired off a few shots. That seemed to scare it. I looked and managed to get a headshot, yet I still stood. 

It looked at me and fled into the distance, I ignored the 10-53 and got into my car and drove off. I went to one of the ranger centers and reported it in, apparently there's been multiple reports. 

There have been multiple reports and they did nothing. I turned in my badge at that moment. I’m haunted by that thing, it’s eyes still appear in my nightmares. After 6 deadacted years of working there I quit. I regret it a bit, but I hope I never see the goat man again…
