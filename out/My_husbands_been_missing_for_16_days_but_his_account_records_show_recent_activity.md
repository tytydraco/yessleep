I need help. I don't know who else to turn to anymore.

This is my 3rd attempt at asking for help. Or maybe my 4th. The days are blending together now. I can't write a concise story anymore 

My husband David has been missing for 16 days now, and the police aren't taking it seriously. They keep saying adults have the right to leave, that there's no sign of foul play, but they don't understand. 

David would never abandon his work like this. He's been so obsessed with building his own little empire that sometimes I wonder if he still ~~remembered~~ remembers he has a wife to attend to. That's why I'm in his home office now, trying to keep things organized until he comes back.

Papers keep moving by themselves around his desk. He always left them scattered when inspiration struck–too absorbed in his numbers to even close the window.

**Time feels wrong in here.**

His mouse is definitely failing too; it drifts across the screen sometimes. Who even uses a mouse these days? I’ll have to order a new one, next day delivery. I need to keep his business running smoothly until he returns. Everything needs to work perfectly.

I haven't been sleeping. Can't sleep. Just as I was falling into whatever comes after three days of being awake, I heard muffled sounds coming from his office. Not the usual house settling noises, but something\*\*... deliberate\*\*. 

There's something about this particular noise that in the middle of a deadly silent night made my heart explode in my chest. It was like someone was there, but again, I haven't been sleeping much, as I said before. Or did I say that already?

I can’t trust my senses anymore. Sleep deprivation does strange things to a person. Makes them see things that aren't there. Or maybe makes them see things that are?

**I heard it again.** 

That soft scratching sound. When I forced myself to look, there were papers scattered across his desk that I know I had filed away. Client contracts, billing statements, transfer authorizations. And in the margins of each one, scrawled in handwriting that looked like mine but couldn't be mine, were numbers. Account numbers. Dates. Amounts. 

David was explicit about keeping me away from his personal finances. He made that very clear *that night*.

The police asked about his computer today, I told them I didn’t know his login info. I couldn't let them see. I've changed all his passwords, no one else has access, but somehow new documents keep appearing. Lists of transactions. Transfers I don't remember making. 

But that's impossible. I'm so careful with the accounts. So careful about everything now.

His chair was facing the door again this morning. I always push it in at night, but every morning it's turned around. 

**Watching.** 

The leather is wearing thin in places I don't remember. There's a stain on the armrest that won't come out, no matter how hard I scrub.

I'm writing this from his office now. It's 3:27 AM and I heard the sound again. But this time when I came to check, I found something new on his desk. Numbers everywhere, in my handwriting. Pages and pages of them. Transfer amounts. Account passwords. Three hours between each transfer - just enough time not to trigger the bank's suspicious activity alerts.

I didn't write these. Or did I? I couldn't have written these. But there's ink on my fingers. Or at least, I keep telling myself it's ink.Sleeping so little has made me wonder about the most simple things around me. 

The scratching sound is getting louder. It's not coming from the papers anymore. It's coming from beneath the floorboard under his chair. The one I fixed. The one I made sure was clean.

**Something's wrong.**

The room is too cold. There's something dark seeping through the wood. Something that smells like his aftershave, but sharper. *Metallic.*

I have to finish this quickly. The police are back. They're asking about the fresh dirt in the garden, but that's not where they should look. They never look in the right places. Never ask the right [questions](https://www.instagram.com/the._undying/).
