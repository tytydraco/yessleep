I don’t expect you to believe this story — I myself am unsure if it’s truth or the invention of a sick mind. And yet, I beg you: anyone reading this, try to remember — has a faceless shadow ever visited your dreams? Because it may do to you what it did to me.

I’ll start from the beginning. Lately — though I can’t say exactly how long — I’ve had memory lapses. At first, they were trivial. I’d forget where I parked my car, and I brushed it off. Then I began forgetting the way to my own apartment, my name, and — God help me — even my family. Each day I woke in this house, and though everything was familiar, it felt foreign, like someone had laid out my things for me.

I feared I was developing dementia. I was ready to see a doctor — if not for last night. God… that evening, I found one of the notebooks. It was behind my bed. I swear I never put it there. But I opened it. The first pages were written in my own hand — and yet I had no memory of writing them. I read: “My brother died in a car crash. Absurd. Accidental. A man ran a red light while texting and killed him. I had to identify the body. He was the only family I had left. Goodbye, little brother. I love you.”

I couldn't breathe. A panic attack gripped me. My legs gave out, I gasped for air, and my heart lurched between eruption and stillness. I swear on my life: I did not remember this. Shaking, I turned more pages. Memories — in my own handwriting — but not mine. I thought Alzheimer’s had devoured my brain. I decided to keep journals, to not lose myself completely.

Then I came to an entry that paralyzed me with primal fear. It followed a passage about my drinking binge — after losing my job, my brother, my will to live. The next page read: “I was lying on the couch, staring at the static of the TV. I couldn’t rise, couldn’t turn the damn thing off. Then the air grew heavier. I breathed through cotton. The room tilted. And in the doorway… it stood. A dark figure. Gaunt. Neither man nor beast. Towering shadow. Its face — blurred. I tried to reconstruct it instinctively, but couldn’t, as if it was never meant to be seen. Its voice didn’t come from its mouth. It buzzed in my head, low and distorted like radio static. It said it could take away what haunted me — take away all my pain. No soul, no blood, no price was asked. That night, I was too broken. And so… I agreed. The funeral. The phone call. My brother’s disfigured jaw. I gave all those memories to the creature. And now, waking up, I feel light. Alive. Calm.Happy. The echoes are fading. I can’t remember why I was ever sad. I’ll leave this notebook somewhere, so I never return to it again.”

Terror seized me. I had erased my own brother. I stared at the notebook in horror, sweat dripping from my brow. Swallowing the lump in my throat, I tried to remember his name — but the memory slipped away, like a cruel game. I sat for hours. Nothing came. I flipped through the notebook again. None of it rang true to my mind — the dead brother, the panic attack in college, the missing cat — nothing. My head was empty.

Then the thought struck me: Had I given away all my painful memories to this being? I nearly vomited.

But I realized I no longer remembered the good either. My only memories now were of confusion — "Where is my home?" "What is my name?" Nothing else. The more I thought, the more yesterday slipped through my fingers, and even this morning blurred. I stumbled into the kitchen, dizzy, trembling with dread.

In the trash, another notebook.

I tore into it like it held fragments of my soul. Pages were ripped out. Some made no sense. Some were just drawings: doors, corridors, eyes, the tall faceless figure. But on one page — a chilling entry: “Strange dreams haunt me. Not quite nightmares — but suffocating all the same. I stand in a corridor, lined with doors. Behind each one is me — but different: crying, screaming, paralyzed. Every dream ends the same. I turn around. And it’s there. Smiling… That smile feels familiar, as if I’ve seen it before. I gave it another memory. Don’t know which number. The one about the assholes in college who mocked me. Soon I’ll forget them, too. And… God… How good it feels, living without the weight of these horrors. I never want to go back.”

Terror crawled beneath my skin, nestled into my bones. Reality unraveled. My life, this world — none of it felt real. I tore my home apart. Found notebooks in drawers, under the bed, even in a vent. It was as if I’d hidden parts of myself everywhere, knowing I’d forget.

Pages missing. Doodles. Fragments of joy. Then behind the radiator — another notebook. One page: “Something strange again. Woke in the night. A woman stared at me, eyes full of horror. She called me Ben.” Ben… But in another diary, I called myself John. I ran to the bathroom, hands shaking, opened the mirror — and stared.

I didn’t recognize the face. Eyes too wide. Too calm. I doubled over in pain and vomited into the toilet. There — another notebook under the tub. Again, ripped pages. A couple lines survived: “You gave it your name. You gave it your face. Stop making deals. These aren’t just memories. It’s taking YOU.”

I flung it away and stared at the ceiling. What’s left of me? I think I gave away my mother. My childhood. I vaguely recall green was once my favorite color — but now, when I look at a green towel, something feels wrong.

It’s been… maybe 30 hours. I’m trying not to sleep. If I do, it’ll come. And I’ll give up even this. Hours ago, two memories pierced my mind like ice: Hiding with my little brother from our drunken father and standing at my brother’s funeral. How much I’ve sacrificed for peace. Dear God, I’ll soon fall asleep. I’ll forget the notebooks. The memories. Myself.

But… there’s one more thing.

In this sleepless stretch, I feel it. In the house. Watching from corners. Humming songs I may have once known. Soon, it’ll end. And the scariest part?

As I type this, two visions form: I’m a child in the closet again. No brother. My father screams my name — but I can’t understand it. The closet door opens. It’s not my father. It’s me — from before the deals. He looks at me like a corpse. Behind him… it smiles. Another one, I’m at my brother’s funeral. But this time… he’s standing. Crying. And I’m the one in the coffin.

Please — don’t make deals if you see it.

Even your worst memories are part of you. Pain shapes you. Once you reject that… the faceless thing will walk into the world with your smile.
And then, nothing of you will remain. Because you are not only your joy.

You are all that you remember. And it wants you to be nothing.
