I always knew something was wrong with Aiden. Even when we were kids, there was a detachment in his eyes that couldn’t be explained by shyness, intelligence, or even some hidden sadness.

It was something far more disturbing. When a squirrel fell from a tree near our sidewalk and writhed in agony, Aiden giggled and took pictures of it with a camera. Same thing when the neighbor’s dog got hit by a car—Aiden drew detailed pictures of the dog, torn in two. He even drew himself next to it, smiling at its death.

He didn’t cry when our mom died. I cried—God, I was completely lost, just like our father. But Aiden? He just stood there, watching her body being zipped into a black bag, a faint smirk on his lips, like it was all part of some elaborate joke only he understood.

We used to be close, like real brothers, but that didn’t last. After I went to college and cut off all contact, I felt like I’d freed myself from something dark.

Let me explain: Aiden had a supernatural ability to manipulate people—make them feel worthless, stupid, insane. And he enjoyed it. He could mimic emotions so convincingly you’d think he was the nicest guy you’d ever met. But it was just a mask, hiding a true monster.

Our parents tried talking to Aiden, took him to a psychologist—but the therapist quit after Aiden brought a dead rat to one of the sessions. The psychologist said he needed real help, institutional help. He had problems at school too: he blackmailed girls, threatening to spread rumors or post their private photos. He got into fights, smashed windows, vandalized property of those he clashed with.

Meanwhile, I carefully built my life after leaving home. Graduated with honors, got a job at a prestigious marketing firm, married a kind, smart, and incredibly beautiful woman named Grace. We bought a modest house in a good neighborhood, got a dog.

I started seeing a therapist to talk through the traumas of childhood, and whenever Aiden came up, I’d get goosebumps. My breath would catch. I cut off all contact with Aiden after our father died five years ago. I didn’t even attend the funeral. I just couldn’t see Aiden again—I’d have vomited on the spot. Grace didn’t understand, but she respected my choice.

Everything fell apart a couple of months ago.
The first sign was barely noticeable. One morning at work, I noticed people staring at me. Not just casual looks—there were no greetings, just heavy, judgmental gazes. I chalked it up to a bad day, but then one of my coworkers, Melissa, began avoiding me in the break room. When I said hi, she literally flinched. I tried to joke it off, but her eyes… they held something like disgust.

I asked her what was wrong, what was going on, and I saw a mix of revulsion and fear in her eyes as she hesitantly began:

"Why did you send me that video?"

"What video? What are you talking about?"

"Don’t play dumb. You sent me that video last night. Just… stay away from me, freak."

I barely made it through the workday, completely confused. I swear to God, I hadn’t sent her anything. When I got home, I checked my email. Someone had sent Melissa a link from my account. My forehead broke into a sweat—someone had hacked me. But what was in the link that made everyone look at me with such revulsion all day? With trembling fingers, I clicked it.
It led to a porn site—one of the filthiest I’ve ever seen. The title of the video made my stomach twist:

“Daddy-CEO punishes his intern HARD.”

I stared at the thumbnail, blinking, struggling to breathe.

It was me.

It wasn’t someone who looked like me. It was me. My face. My voice. But I had never filmed anything like that—I’d never even taken racy photos.

The man in the video, whose face was expertly replaced with mine, was involved in a graphic, aggressive gay porn scene. But it wasn’t just sex. The dialogue was brutal and sadistic. There were acts of hardcore BDSM that made me feel like vomiting again. I watched for maybe two minutes, paralyzed, before I slammed my laptop shut. Stumbling away from the table, I felt the crushing weight of a panic attack.

I was shaking. Uncontrollably.

Grace walked into the room. She saw me on the floor, knees pulled up, pale.

“What happened, honey?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

That video was only the beginning.

I changed all my passwords, tightened my online security. But the next day, another email arrived. Then another. Dozens of videos—all with my face, my voice, my gestures. Some were homosexual, some with women, some orgies—all violent, degrading, some involving illegal themes.

These weren’t amateur fakes. They were crafted with terrifying precision, by someone who clearly knew what they were doing. And that’s when I remembered: Aiden had studied programmin. He’d always had a passion for computers.

I contacted the site hosting the videos. No response. The police told me to contact the cybercrime unit. I filed a report, but again—no reply.

The videos kept coming. Then Grace saw them. Someone had sent them to her.

One day I came home from work to a silent house. She was at the kitchen table, a half-empty bottle of wine beside her, staring into space. Her face was pale.

“I saw it. I saw everything.”

I tried to explain—tried to tell her it wasn’t real, that it wasn’t me. She listened, eyes full of tears, then slowly pushed her laptop toward me.

There was a new video. This time, my face again, not me, but my face was featured in coprophilic porn. I couldn’t finish watching. Grace did.

“I don’t care if it’s fake,” she said. “I can’t unsee it. My family saw it. My coworkers. What am I supposed to tell them? That it’s not my husband?”

She left the next day.

She packed while I sat on the stairs, too numb to speak. She looked back once. Her eyes were empty.

“You need help,” she whispered.

Then she was gone. For good. She never read my messages again. Eventually, I was blocked.
Then my job. HR called me in—worried faces. They mentioned the videos—someone had sent them to clients. I pleaded my case, told them it was fake, that I was being framed. They nodded—but just for show. They’d already decided.

“Unfortunately, we can’t afford a scandal. We recommend you resign voluntarily.”

I lost everything.

And I knew exactly who was behind it. Only one person could do this—knew how to hurt me, wanted to.

I hadn’t spoken to Aiden in years, but I still had his email. I sent him one message:

“I know it’s you. Why are you doing this?”

No response.

The next day, a package arrived at my door. No return address. Inside was a flash drive.
I hesitated for hours before plugging it into my computer. The folder was labeled “BROTHER.”
Inside were hundreds of files—videos, audio, Photoshop layers of my face, voice copies. But one file caught my eye—it was dated five days ago.
I clicked.

It was a video—not fake, a real recording. A camera had been set up in my bedroom. I was asleep, blanket half-thrown off, softly snoring.
Someone had been in my house.

I vomited in the bathroom. I was shaking with fear. I called the police again. They found no signs of forced entry. They were polite but clearly didn’t believe me.

I started locking every window and door, installed cameras, bought an alarm system, and searched for hidden cameras. I stopped sleeping, barely ate. I felt eyes on me constantly. I began seeing Aiden everywhere in reflections, cars behind me, across the street at night. I never caught him, but I knew he was watching.

Then the phone calls started. Just breathing on the line. Food deliveries arrived every hour.
The worst came when police arrested me. Someone reported that I was planning a school bombing.

I swore my brother was trying to destroy my life. I handed over the flash drive. They said they’d investigate and released me.

One night, reviewing my camera footage, I saw him. For just a second—a silhouette in my hallway. Then… gone.

I moved to a hotel.

The next morning, the entire parking lot was plastered with flyers. My face, bold letters accusing me of being a pedophile and animal abuser—claiming I poisoned stray dogs and preyed on children. My phone number printed at the bottom.

Security called the cops. They reviewed the hotel’s cameras. Found nothing.

Then I began seeing Aiden in my dreams. Standing at the foot of my bed, photographing me like he did as a child.

I started carrying a knife. No one speaks to me anymore—friends, colleagues—they’ve all blocked me. I’ve become a ghost in my own life, drifting from hotel to hotel, jobless, divorced, and paranoid.

Then came the worst.

Another package. No return address. Inside—an old VHS tape and a note: “The good old days.”
I borrowed a VCR from a pawn shop. I watched the tape.

It was us—Aiden and me as kids. For context, he’s five years older. He held the camera, filming our childhood home. It was normal… until he went into the basement.

I didn’t remember any of it.

Aiden appeared on screen, holding a dead cat, a kitchen knife beside him. I can’t even describe what he did next—I’ll vomit again. But I recognized the cat. She’d been a stray I loved. I begged our parents to keep her once.

Then Aiden looked at the camera. It cut to me. I was maybe five. Tied to a chair, mouth duct-taped, crying, convulsing, trying to break free.

“I saved the tape,” his older voice said. “In case I ever needed to remind you what you are.”

I don’t remember it. None of it.

He’s always been there. Behind every failure, every fear. Like a cancer I thought I cut out—but left a single cell behind.

I began digging through social media, forums—anything. After a sleepless night, I found one of his accounts. The posts were normal—except one. Aiden wrote that before killing someone, you should first destroy their life. Watch them break. See what they do when their world crumbles into hell.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no strength left. I’ve lost weight. And like Aiden said, I’m broken.

I pray the police find him. Because if they don’t, my brother will kill me.

Please, someone, help me.
