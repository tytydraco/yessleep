After around twenty-two years of living on this planet  I finally asked myself this question. I have always lived by the ideology that we live to die, that we don’t matter and nothing I do can change what will happen in a hundred-thousand years time. I don’t pray for I am not religious however I don’t doubt that there was a creator out there whose objectives we shall never understand. I’m sure this question is what a lot of others ask themselves, however everyone else in my life seems to be naïve to living, acting in ignorance instead of pondering what we are even doing here. For a long period of my life I asked myself about the changes we have to go through, the decisions we have to make and the mistakes we have to learn from. Being the most intelligent species on the planet doesn’t feel significant to us it feels normal. It feels we are the only ones to understand right and wrong, the only ones able to navigate this world and to be able to fix it. 

Sometimes I wonder what the men before believed about life. The ones whose simple minds couldn’t even comprehend us. When we first came to Earth many of our kind felt bad about ridding the world of them, for in our minds they were innocent and harmless but in the end we carried on the extinction process because they were so weak, so mindless that it felt ok. Because the Earth needed them to be gone. Because surely such an insignificant and un evolved species couldn’t possibly endure pain, let alone have any perception of it. Right..?

It has been three-thousand years since the extinction process took place. Without them many species have been able to flourish and to evolve. We see ourselves as heroes, the solution needed to save this planet from its inevitable destruction. Better yet we finally have a place we can call ‘home’.

Four thousand years have passed since we came to this planet. We thought of ourselves as the good ones, the saviours destined to keep planet Earth from crumbling but we were wrong. We only made it worse. We have plagued this world with our self interest. The Earths closer to perishing than it ever has been. It’s inevitable really, you know? But at-least I won’t be here to see it. Or so I thought

But I see now, we are all just parts in a never ending process, from the day we arrived to the day we left we were nothing more than just a chain. We believed for so long that we were the change, the final change to stop the species on Earth from tearing it apart. Up until they came, ‘Gods Angels’ as some of us referred to them as, coming with the same idea, the same mindset that we had to free the Earth from the mindless idiots destroying it. 

I may not fully know what life was. But at-least I know what death is.
