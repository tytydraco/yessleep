[\[Part 39\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1laa0bb/the_call_of_the_breach_part_39/)

*Creak.*

The brakes on our armored truck squeaked, our column ground to a halt, and the sudden change in momentum shook me from my drowsiness. Everyone else on the twin rows of seats almost fell over as one, and muffled curses filled the stuffy interior.

“Commander, you need to see this.” From the front compartment, the driver called back through the narrow confines of the truck, and I caught the dull *whump-whump* of mortar shells impacting somewhere outside.

*Those are a half-mile off at most. ELSAR is closing in. We need to move fast.*

Rising from beside me, Chris lumbered through the cramped vehicle to squeeze himself in between the front seats and peered out the windshield.

“Everyone who can still fight, dismount.” He wriggled back toward the rear doors of the MRAP, rifle in hand. “Stay within eyesight of the convoy. Jamie, Hannah, with me.”

Icy wind howled in as soon as the rear doors opened, but the groans of complaint were gone from us. Everyone could tell from Chris’s demeanor that we were in the thick of it now. Out of the warm truck we clambered, and coming around the side of the lead vehicle, I found my breath stuck in both lungs.

We stood amidst the ruins of the outer suburbs of pre-Breach Black Oak, before the wall had been built by ELSAR. By my reckoning, we were perhaps five miles distant from the southern gate, but even from this far no one could miss the great billows of oily black smoke. Black Oak burned like a torch in the wintry night, and through the gaps between the plumes I spotted flitting shapes high above the aura of a few searchlights. These angular shadows did not flap their wings, and I knew they had no need to, for this threat was not Breach-borne at all. Row after row of planes rumbled on through the night, and rained down a steady curtain of bombs that ripped apart the last city we had like it was made of tissue paper. Rockets screamed in from across the further horizon, and each explosion threw debris like confetti at a child’s party. Entire high-rise buildings in the prominent districts shuddered as they were hit, and some even collapsed under the weight of the bombardment. Acrid smoke coiled in the air like dirty fog, and with it came the dust of incinerated concrete, all blown along with the snow. I could taste the soot on the breeze, the melting asphalt of ten thousand shingles, the tarpaper of commercial buildings, and the dust of the central works as they were ground to powder by the heavy guns. Each detonation reverberated through the ground beneath my feet in titanic drumbeats, the roar of them deafening. Worst of it all, however, was the long line of shadowy figures that streamed down the cracked asphalt streets of the abandoned districts, a great snake of bodies that engulfed the vanguard of our little convoy in a sea of panicked faces.

Thousands of fleeing civilians trudged through the wind and snow, their eyes wild, dragging or carrying whatever possessions they’d managed to snatch from their homes. Many were wounded, some burned, and they shivered against the cold with mournful expressions that tore at my soul. The children were especially pitiful; some with no shoes, others in their nightclothes, crying and shaking in the snowfall as whatever guardians they had led them on. Out of reflex, our riflemen formed a wall just to keep the horde from clambering into the back of our trucks and instead waved them on past us into the cruel winter’s night. Thousands of them flooded by, begging at the ends of our rifle muzzles for whatever help they thought we could give them, and it seemed there was no end in sight of the human caravan.

*Honk-honk!*

Dim slivers of light pierced through the gloom, and a long line of vehicles slowly wove their way up the road toward us. Their headlights were nearly blacked out with layers of tape, done to keep the enemy aircraft from spotting them so easily. Many were laden with more civilians, as well as exhausted coalition soldiers, most of which were wounded. Bullets had scarred most of the trucks, shrapnel marks on the armored hides, and the barrels of their machine guns steamed from the amount of firing they’d sustained. More of our troops followed on foot, heads bent against the breeze, feet dragging with fatigue in the snow. While the column retreated in good order, I wondered how fast our defenses were collapsing if so many were already on the retreat.

A civilian SUV pulled up to where we stood, allowing the rest of the retreating column to rumble past, and the passenger side window rolled down.

“Is that you, Dekker?” From inside, a gruff male voice barked through the darkness.

*No way.*

My heart skipped a surprised beat, and Chris’s face reflected that shock as he stepped forward to peer into the car’s interior. “Commander?”

Sean leaned out, his face thin, but with both eyes alight in their old fire that I hadn’t seen since the day Andrea had been killed. He wore his green coalition uniform, an M4 across his lap, though I noted the metal brace strapped to his right side. This had been the first time I’d seen him out of his room since my wedding, and while I doubted Sean could have climbed from the truck seat on his own with much speed, to see him back in action made some of my panic ebb.

“You’re a sight for sore eyes.” Chris shifted his rifle to one arm and reached in to give Sean a handshake. “We came as fast as we could. How bad is it?”

“It’s a royal shitshow.” Sean rested an elbow on the window and rubbed his tired face with one hand, dark bags under his eyes. “They hit us out of nowhere, tanks, infantry, wave after wave of it. We managed to evacuate most of our people from the town but there’s at least two thousand mercs bearing down on us from east and west.”

Jamie dared to sidle closer and hefted the strap of her AK on one shoulder. “Where do you need us?”

Sean made a small grin, and didn’t seem at all surprised at Jamie’s premature return from her exile. “Nice to see you too, Lansen. I’ve got Ethan’s workers running small convoys to ferry what little we have to a rally point south of here. As of right now, what I need is more trucks for the evacuation and more men at the front to keep ELSAR off our backs.”

Chris jerked his thumb back at our lineup of idling vehicles. “There was a shake up back at the mission zone. ELSAR high command demoted Riken, so he took his boys and headed for the border. We’ve got enough men and trucks to help, but plenty wounded of our own; some are in a really bad way . . .”

Overhead, an unseen jet streaked by, probably above the clouds but low enough to make everyone jump like skittish rabbits beneath a hawk. The refugees cringed with fear, some of the children began to wail, and more than one person tried to crawl under our trucks to find cover. Our soldiers had to push them back, a heart-wrenching effort considering how desperate these people were, but we couldn’t let them wriggle under our tires out of sheer hysteria. Never before in my life had I been afraid of a helicopter’s whir or an airplane’s buzz, but now it seared deep into my mind with primitive, almost reflexive urgency.

*We need to get out of the open.*

His eyes traversed the dark clouds, and Sean’s lower jaw worked back and forth in anxious tension. “Our medical train is taking priority for vehicle extraction, along with what supplies we have left. As for your wounded, load whoever can’t walk on the retreating columns and have those who can move on their own follow with the rest of our troops. Our goal is to reach Rally Point 9; after that we move all the non-combatants south, beyond the ridgeline to Ark River.”

“Adam’s hit bad.” At the mention of the bastion, I dared to meet Sean’s gaze, and gripped my Type 9 strap in one clammy fist. “He needs a hospital. Did Eve and her people make it out?”

Sean let a grim frown twist over his stubbled face. “Most of them. If they aren’t on the front with our boys, they’re helping to ferry civilians to the aid station a few blocks down, but ELSAR has mobile squads that keep targeting our medics. I’ve got two platoons pulling security around the aid station, and I believe 4^(th) Platoon is one of them. If you can get to there and reinforce the right flank, it might give the medics enough breathing room so they can relocate to a safer position.”

“Well, first thing’s first, I need someone to get us new radios . . .” Chris started giving orders, then seemed to remember that, with Sean back, he was no longer our commander. Part of me felt a twinge of disappointment at that; not because I held any ill will toward Sean, but because I had grown used to following Chris in the grand order of things. Now he was back to being Head Ranger, and I a mere platoon commander. While I didn’t mind resuming my old post, it only served to remind me that all our grandiose plans for Chris leading a new peacetime government had gone up in smoke with the rest of Black Oak.

*So much for handing out toys on Christmas.*

“Dekker, you take command of the battlefield.” Sean gauged the situation well, reaching into the SUV interior behind him to produce two handing spare radios with headsets, which he gave to Chris and I. “I’m no use to us crippled, so I’ll organize our camp at the rally point and get our comms system back in order. Whatever you do, do *not* get decisively engaged out there; there’s too many mercenaries, and if you get encircled, I won’t be able to break you out.”

Confident now that he had something to accomplish, Chris straightened up and turned to me. “We’ll try to keep mobile and use probing attacks to keep the enemy off balance. I’ll take the bulk of our forces up the center and left, while you and Jamie get to the aid station on our right. Maybe they can work on Adam before the mercs get there.”

Jamie and Chris headed back toward our convoy, but as I moved to follow, Sean’s voice cut me off. “Captain?”

I turned to find a familiar green canvas sling bag held out to me, Sean’s dark eye cloaked in a serious glint. Fiery embarrassment at my own blunder rippled through me, and I avoided his pointed stare. Not wishing to lose such an important item inside the Breach, I’d elected to leave the launch panel in the safe at my room in the university, but by doing so I’d nearly lost our most dangerous secret to the enemy.

*Stupid. Imagine if Crow got her hands on those missiles. God only knows what that psycho would do.*

Ashamed, I shuffled over and took the panel with a meek wince. “Commander, I—"

“You did the right thing, Hannah.” Sean fixed me with a knowing look but angled his head back towards the burning city. “I headed straight for your quarters the moment I heard the first shells go off. Had to get a few aides to help me with the stairs, but I managed. No matter what happens out there, you stick to our agreement, understood? This panel does *not* fall into their hands. If all hope is lost, if I give you the order, you launch on command.”

My throat tried to close up at the notion, memories from the Breach coming back as I saw in my head the rising mushroom cloud, the field of corpses, the burned landscape. Had it been a vision of the future? Had it been another of Vecitorak’s illusions meant to trick me? I couldn’t know, but with ELSAR bearing down on us, the prospect of a nuclear strike by my own hand had never been higher. Could I really bring myself to send missiles screaming down on our own heads when the time came?

*It won’t come to that. It can’t. We have a destiny on the other side of the Breach, we can’t just blast ourselves into glass.*

Still, I slung the bag onto my back and made a trim salute. “I understand, sir.”

His car rolled on, and I rejoined the others as our convoy wove its way toward the city, a slow effort considering all the fleeing civilians. Once before we’d done this, but that had been a day of victory, where our forces caught the mercenaries by surprise. Now we charged forward in a desperate, mad-dash through flaming debris, over rubble-strewn lanes, and into the chaotic frontline.

Bomb craters made most of the streets impassable, and almost half of the buildings were on fire. Shrapnel cut down refugees where they stood, and our drivers had to swerve to avoid hitting the staggering crowds that begged us to take them to safety. Smoke would sometimes cloud our vision, and fire scorched the paint from the sides of the trucks, the heat so intense I watched the color peel off in burnt chunks. Explosions rocked us, even from several blocks away, the shockwaves strong enough to shatter whatever glass remained in the buildings. ELSAR had been holding back in times past, I realized; here they brought the full might of their shadowy empire down on us with ruthless ferocity. Crow was now in charge of all their ground forces, and she had no intention of showing us mercy.

*And she was from here, being an Auxiliary. This county is her home, these people are her neighbors. How can someone do this to their own people?*

Less than two miles from the southern gate, a side road down a row of split-level houses revealed a slow-moving circle of vehicles onto which medics loaded stretchers of wounded. The drivers seemed to move as fast as they could to get out of the lineup once their human cargo was loaded, unwilling to be another target of the missiles that continued to fall from the sky. More trucks clogged the drive inward, and it made my stomach twist to see bodies lying under blankets or tarps in front of the houses, with the interiors of said buildings presumably too packed to fit the dead.

At a makeshift checkpoint in the entrance to the drive, a group of our troops flagged us down, and I recognized Sergeant McPhearson among them.

Jamie and I climbed out of the MRAP at the curb, and Chris pointed down the column to the trucks that carried our wounded. “Alright, take trucks two, nine, and four, link up with 4^(th) platoon and whoever else you can find, and form a security perimeter around the aid station. I’ll take everyone else and hold the line. Once Sandra can move her people out, I’ll pull back to meet you.”

Our eyes met, and a twinge of pain cut through my chest. I wanted more than anything to hold him, to kiss him one more time, but I knew we didn’t have the time for that. Like so many women and girls in our coalition, I had to hope that my husband wouldn’t be cut down by the cruel fusillade of the enemy, and I would see his smile once more in the morning. Just the thought of Chris’s death made me want to crumple, but I had to keep my calm if we were to survive this night.

In that spirit, I climbed up onto a small metal step under the truck door and nodded at him through the open window. “We can win this.”

His hand found mine for a moment, and Chris made a grim smile. “I wish I had your optimism, *pragtige*.”

We let go of one another and I stepped back as his column rolled onward into the distant gunfire, taking the rest of our able-bodied men towards the enemy.

*Adonai, go with him.*

“Evening, Captain.” Sergeant McPhearson seemed relieved at my approach, motioning for his guards to wave us through. “4th will be glad to see you, we’ve been taking a real beating out there. Welcome back, Captain Lansen.”

Jamie exchanged a polite nod with him, her rapport still high amongst the Rangers in spite of the previous trial. Others stared at her as we passed, some surprised, a few glaring, but most with a worn-out indifference on their scruffy faces. Our men had been fighting all night, both those of us who had gone to the Breach and those who had stayed behind. At this point, it seemed no one had the energy to pick a bone with Jamie’s return from exile.

“It’s certainly been a long night.” As the men from my three trucks clambered out to take a quick smoke break with the checkpoint guards, Jamie and I followed Charlie to a nearby row of gutted suburban houses, the three of us scrambling for cover as a plane screamed low overhead. “Major Dekker sent me to take over this sector. Catch me up.”

Sergeant McPherson led us into the nearest bombed-out hovel, through the moldy living room to a cire-blackened kitchen where we could look out toward the city. “4^(th) Platoon is dug in on the houses to the right, with 2^(nd) Ark River Lancers in the ones on our left. We’ve got maybe twenty-seven men between us. Lost a lot of guys when the university clock tower collapsed.”

*And so our little army continues to shrink. How long can we keep this up? There are thousands of ELSAR mercs out there.*

“What heavy weapons do you have?” Jamie peered at the sky, her AK in hand.

“Six rocket launchers between us, maybe ten rockets left per each.” Picking a bit of debris from his dirty uniform sleeve, Sergeant McPherson flicked his eyes to the snowy clouds as well. “That’s for the anti-air anyway. We’ve got twice that for anti-armor, but most of it won’t even scratch the hide on ELSAR’s main battle tanks. Most of our machine guns are operational, but the houses here are too close together for us to engage the enemy at range, so when they show up, they’ll be right on top of us.”

“How close are they?” I squinted down the long street to my left, our house not quite on the corner of its block and tried to summon *the focus* so I could see better.

“Maybe two blocks. Snipers are getting frisky, so keep your head down.” His throat bobbed with a swallow of dread, and Charlie flexed one set of fingers on his rifle sling. “You didn’t bring as many men back as we thought. How bad was it, for you guys?”

My brow furrowed, and I tried to conjure something to say amidst the flood of recent memories. How could I explain to him, to anyone, what was going to happen? Nothing had prepared me for what I’s seen, what I had been told, *who* I’d met. Jamie didn’t think anyone would believe me, or they’d panic if they knew what the fate of Barron County was, and we were already in the fight of our lives here. As much as I trusted my platoon sergeant, perhaps some things were better left unsaid, at least for now. We both needed clear heads for what was to come.

*It's a matter of faith now.*

Drawing myself up ramrod straight as I’d seen Sean do multiple times when reviewing the troops, I cradled my Type 9 under one arm and watched the men from my convoy fill in the defensive positions around 4^(th) and 2^(nd) platoons. “We did what we set out to do.”

Charlie seemed to understand that was the end of the topic, and the three of us moved in unison to help carry Adam into the aid station. Looking down at the infamous religious leader, I couldn’t help but feel a knot of dread in my guts for how pale he looked. The ELSAR medics had stripped his armor off in order to stabilize his wounds, but that only revealed the mass of bruises that was his body. Vecitorak’s heavy blows hadn’t all been softened by the hand made armor of the southern tribesmen, and parts of his face were burned from the intense heat of the tower room’s blaze. Both legs were in splints, but the skin had turned ugly purple in several areas, bandages covering where the medics had tried to stop the internal bleeding in the field via rudimentary surgery. His chest barely rose with shallow breaths, and in spite of the cold weather, there were small beads of a clammy sweat across the top of Adam’s forehead.

*Sandra can fix him. She can. She has to.*

Getting inside the aid station proved almost as difficult as weaving our vehicles through the refugee-strewn road had been. Wounded lay everywhere, stretched alongside the walls in the hallways, propped up on the steps, even curled into closets shoulder-to-shoulder. The floor was a mess of snowmelt, mud, and blood, which turned the carpets to a mushy sponge of grime, and the hardwood floors slick as glass. It smelled strong of death, metallic blood and burned flesh thick in the air. The groans, cries, and screams of the troops made my heart ache and my stomach roil for their pitiful intensity. Exhausted medics pushed through the crowded rooms to administer whatever aid they could, sometimes operating on the floor itself, their arms stained red up to the elbows.

“We need the chief surgeon.” I caught one of the researcher girls by the arm as she shuffled by and jerked my head at Adam on the stretcher. “He’s critical.”

“We already have twelve others like him.” She shook my hand off, too busy to bother with rank customs. “Take him to the living room for triage.”

Sergeant McPherson opened his mouth to rebuke her, but I stopped the girl again, and tugged aside the blanket so she could see Adam’s sword tucked in behind his shoulder. “He’s a priority case. Take me to your surgeon, *now*.”

She didn’t react much, just shrugged her shoulders and the girl led us to what must have been the former dining room of the house, where a team of four nurses huddled around the long table. The white table cloth was a sea of red, and the floor gritted under my boots as we entered. A small trash can nearby held bits of metal, wood, and flesh mixed in with blood, debris that had been no doubt pulled from dozens of torn bodies over the past half hour. I had seen our coalition at its height, when we had the sophisticated clinic at New Wilderness to work with, the beds clean, the floors swept, the staff calm and confident. This was its charnel opposite; a nightmare of filth and blood, too many problems and not enough supplies, cramped into the skeletal remains of our old world. None of the horror movies I’d watched with matt and Carla could ever have come close to such a gruesome sight, and I found myself fighting to keep my eyes averted from a row of hacksaws stung up by the sashcord, each dripping dark red viscera onto the windowsill below.

*Is this what hell looks like?*

“Someone get more sand on the floor.” One of the masked figures straightened up, and I recognized Sandra’s voice as she reached for another blood-smeared surgical tool. “Swab, Deb, I can’t see through all that. What’s the pressure reading?”

Another medic with her own bandage wound tight around the left arm stood next to a blood-pressure monitor, and gave a silent, mournful shake of her head.

Sandra pressed her fingers to the artery on the man’s neck, her shoulders slumped in disappointment, and she waved for a stretcher team to move in. “Take him outside with the others. No sense wasting the extra sutures. Get me the next one.”

At that, she looked up to see us bringing Adam forward, and Sandra’s expression flashed in panic. “Eve, wait—”

But one of the other nurses had already turned around, and I saw the armor under her apron, the blonde hair tied behind the straps of her surgical mask, and the two golden irises that locked onto Adam with abject shock. Our stretcher team froze in place, the entire room seemed to hold its breath, and I cursed myself for not thinking of this sooner. Sean had said Eve was somewhere nearby; her soldiers’ presence should have alerted me to the possibility of her being here.

*Oh man, this is going to get ugly.*

Trembling hands coated in bloody rubber gloves tore the mask from her face, and Eve stumbled to her husband’s side, almost too stunned to put one foot in front of the other. “No . . .”

“He’s got fractures in both legs.” Jamie did the sensible thing, pushed past Eve and dragged her end of the litter forward, until we four stretcher bearers lowered Adam onto the operating table. “We did what we could, but he nicked something in there, and the bleeding won’t stop. Sean cleared him for priority.”

*Boom.*

A shell exploded somewhere outside, and I could hear clumps of frozen dirt raining down on the roof above us. Our men in the surrounding security positions began to open fire, and the roar of machine guns clattered between the houses, along with the faint *krump* of hand grenades. The enemy assault was upon us.

“BP is dropping, slow but steady.” Sandra maintained her composure, and examined Adam with a deft swiftness, as the echoes of artillery thundered closer. “His pulse is weak. I’m going to have to go in and suture whatever is leaking shut, which means opening these stitches back up. Helen, prep another IV, he’s going to need a transfusion.”

“Wait.” Eve’s voice cracked, her emotions on a see-saw, and she fumbled with the pouches on her war belt in an attempt to bargain with the medical officer. “Lantern Rose nectar. It’s helped with bleeding before, and I have a few more vials—”

Sandra shook her head and got to work with her other assistants stepping in around her, pulling a fresh pair of gloves over her bloody ones. “Our studies have shown it sometimes thins the blood depending on the user, and he’s already lost quite a bit. If you hit him with that stuff now, it could kill him. I will do the best I can, but I need your help. Eve?”

When Eve didn’t respond, Sandra paused and turned to find her stock still at Adam’s side, the girl’s cheeks flooded with tears. Eve sobbed, eyes screwed shut, gripping Adam’s hand in her own, and I realized she was trying to pray. Her narrow shoulders heaved with mourning, and it was enough to throw the rest of the tiny room into silence. While she wore her heart on her sleeve, I knew the matriarch of Ark River to be tough when it came to blood and violence. She’d fought at her husband’s side before, seen her people killed, and braved the unknown world full of monsters from the start. This had been a bridge too far, a loss too personal, a grotesque sight too close to her own soul to bear. I’d rarely seen someone break in this way, and it made the looming doom over all of us feel that much heavier in the air.

 Myself, I grimaced at a stab of both anxiety and sympathy inside my chest. After all, how would I react if they brought Chris in on a slab, greyish-white, and near death’s door? This man was all Eve had, her only connection to the normal human world, the one person who had loved her from the start. If he died, her world died with him. True, she had their unborn child, but what girl wanted to raise her baby alone? What child wanted to grow up without a father?

*I would go crazy too.*

“It’s my fault.” I put a hand on hers, squeezing it tight for her comfort, and held Eve’s confused gaze. “He was wounded protecting me. I’m the reason he’s hurt.”

Golden eyes brimming with crystalline pain, Eve stared at me for a long few seconds in morose despair. “I . . . I *can’t* lose him, Hannah.”

From across the table, Sandra’s stern expression softened, and she looked down at her own gloved hands as if doubting herself for the first time. “Then pray that I do a good job.”

*Ka-boom.*

Another explosion rocked the ground beneath us, and more gunfire erupted from the houses around the aid station, some rounds finding their way into our walls.

“*Tanks!*” Someone shouted from outside, and the heavy sound of steel tracks clattered on the pavement not far away. “Enemy tanks inbound!”

“The tracks, shoot for the tracks!” Sergeant McPhearson paced to the nearest window and bellowed through his radio, daring to stick his head out to observe. “Hit the tracks so it can’t move. Disable it!”

Sandra whirled on me, her face a paler shade than it had been moments before. “I’ll need ten, maybe fifteen minutes at least. Once the bleeding has stopped, we can transport him to Ark River, and Eve’s people can take over from there. Tell me you brought more trucks for us?”

Jamie and I shared a trepidatious glance, and somewhere outside, a rocket *whooshed* by to detonate in the neighborhoods behind us.

*They’re faster than we thought. If their tanks got past the front, what’s happened to Chris and his men? Are we surrounded?*

“I have three.” I angled one elbow to the hallway leading to the street. “That’s as much as the front line could spare. There might be five more outside, if they haven’t left yet.”

Her face fell, and Sandra grimaced as if she’d just been hit with a nasty wave of stomach cramps. “We’ll need three times that just to move all these men, not to mention the supplies, the equipment, my staff; we can’t perform most operations without them. I *need* this gear if we’re going to be able to triage patients at the rally point, we can’t just leave it behind. There has to be more trucks.”

My face burned in embarrassment, but I shook my head again. “Aside from the ones already in rotation, we’re it.”

Tension so thick it could have been cut with a knife filled the air, and Sandra’s eyes darted around the room for a moment, as if searching for solutions.

“You have to leave us behind.”

The voice came from one of the wounded men propped up against the wall just on the other side of the open doorway to the hall. He had one arm in a sling, his opposite leg wrapped in bandages, his green coalition uniform stained rusty red with blood. The boy’s face was a swollen mess from where he’d taken shrapnel to one cheek, but a creeping horror dawned on me as I recognized one of my machine gunners from 4^(th) Platoon.

Nick’s resigned, pained look met mine, and he made a rueful half-smile. “It’s like the doc said. She and her girls can’t stay here, and the gear can’t stay. If you take the meds and run, more people live. If you take us but leave the meds, more people will die.”

“A good doctor doesn’t leave her patients.” Sandra rested her gloved hands on her hips, chest heaving as her own emotion began to mount.

Nick shrugged at that. “Then you’ll die with us.”

Eve made a stubborn scowl and pointed to Adam. “I’m not leaving him.”

“So bring him with you.” Climbing to his one good leg with the aid of the doorframe, Nick rested against the wall to make a slight bow of his head to Eve. “He’s too important to leave behind. You need him to lead; you don’t need us.”

Sergeant McPhearson gripped his rifle so hard that the blood drained from his knuckles. “Nick, there’s no way in hell that—”

“For God’s sake, Charlie, I’ll never walk again anyway.” His words came dry and raspy, as if it took every bit of strength Nick had just to stay upright. “If gangrene doesn’t get me, a mutant will. This way is faster.”

Throwing her arms into the air with furious exasperation, Sandra scanned the room for a response she could find support in. “Is no one going to put a stop to this nonsense? Hannah? Lansen?”

Jamie flicked her gaze to Nick and dropped it to her boots in quiet remorse. “There aren’t enough trucks, Sandra.”

*Clunk, clunk, clunk.*

Rifle bullets chattered up the walls of the house, and I knew the time had come for action. Everyone watched me, waiting for my input, and I couldn’t avoid this choice any more than I had the others that had been forced upon me before. Chris had put me in charge of this flank, and it was my job to do what I could to save as much as possible . . . even if I hated myself for it.

*God, forgive me.*

Spinning on my heel, I directed Sergeant Mcphearson to the door. “Charlie, get to the fighting positions and tell them to hold as long as possible. Once I give you the signal on the radio, you have them pull out and run for it through the yards, while Nick and these boys cover our retreat. I’ll be right behind you.”

He bolted out the room in a sprint, rifle in hand, and my decision broke the others from their stalemate.

“I need that scalpel, Mrs. Stirling.” Sandra leaned over Adam to begin her efforts at saving him, Eve by her side, while the other nurses swarmed around them. “Helen, we’re ready for that transfusion whenever you are. Jane, get the other girls and have them start moving supplies; I want those trucks packed so tight that a roach couldn’t fit between the boxes.”

With Jamie at my back, I walked to Nick and offered him my arm to lean on. “Let’s get your men into position.”

 Like an ant hill that had just been kicked, the aid station boiled with activity. Wounded men moved to help their comrades to the nearest windows, shouldering whatever weapons they had. While they got into position, the nurses worked to load up whatever medicine and equipment they could manage onto the trucks, along with however many wounded men they could cram in alongside them. Lastly, they packed themselves into the crowded vehicles, and one by one the truck drivers were waved off, so that they careened out of sight down the boulevard, away from the onslaught that crept up the streets around us.

Inside, Jamie and I helped the worst off sit up at their firing positions or lie prone on tables or couches so they could see out the window. Some were so shot to pieces from their earlier wounds that I doubted they would be conscious much longer, but I didn’t begrudge them the task if they asked for it.

At last, only one truck remained, and even as the enemy fire sliced through the dilapidated structures all around us, I hurtled back into the aid station with Jamie on my heels.

“Time to go doc!” I shouted above the din and crouched to avoid a burst of machine gun fire that chewed through a nearby wall.

Eve and Sandra met us halfway up the blood-soaked corridor, dragging Adam on a stretcher behind them. He sported more gauze than before, and Sandra held an IV drip above her shoulder, a medical bag tucked under her arm. With her own M4 in one hand, Eve hauled on the stretcher with all her might, the vehicle just outside. Jamie and I picked up the opposite end, and together the four of us sprinted the last several yards out to the truck.

Giving Sandra and Eve a leg up into the back of the truck, we shoved Adam inside and I slammed the loading door. “Last run, go, go, go!”

The diesel engine revved as soon as the drive saw my frantic waving, and the bulky armored truck roared away, enemy rounds plinking off its armored hide. Flashes of rifle fire came from windows, around corners, and through side alleys, occupation forces seemingly everywhere. Motorcycles growled in the dark, ELSAR’s fast moving squads working to encircle us, but I pulled the tin whistle from my uniform collar as we ran for cover and gave three long blasts.

“Fall back!” I held down my radio mic, huddled just inside the ruined aid station while Jamie returned fire alongside the others. “All 4^(th) and 2^(nd) fighters, break contact and fall back to the south! Retreat!”

At my slap on her shoulder, Jamie ducked out the doorway and sprinted across the street with a dozen or so others, the wounded men in the aid station unleashing everything they had left at the enemy. I tensed to follow, and as I did, my head turned to catch Nick’s sheet-white face in the corner across the room from me.

He sat back against the wall, clutching his chest, and rivers of red bubbled through his fingers from the bullet that had knocked him off his one good leg. Nick’s rifle lay nearby, empty and smoking amidst a pile of spent brass casings. My horror must have been evident, for he made a small shake of his head.

“Go.” Flecks of red spattered across his lips, but Nick let go of his mortal wound to palm for a handgun in his belt. “We’ll hold them off.”

*Another life for mine.*

Bitter pain gnawed at my soul, but out into the cold dark I went, lead hissing at my every step. Not five seconds after I’d started, a shell came whistling down, and the aid station went up in flames.

*Boom.*

Half blind in the dark, I ran like a rabbit along with the surviving fighters, and the haunting shrieks of our wounded filled my ears as the flames devoured them all.
