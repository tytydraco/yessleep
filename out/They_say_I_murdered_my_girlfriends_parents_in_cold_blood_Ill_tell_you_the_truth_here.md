Please, just read my story.

You have no idea how hard it was to write this in the high-security prison I’m in right now.

Paper is easy to find here, but a pen is like gold—you have to convince them you won’t jam it down someone’s throat. And that was especially hard for me, the dude who "brutally murdered" his girlfriend’s parents. The seventeen-year-old-tried-as-an-adult monster.

To the staff and the media, that’s all I am.

But I’m sure by the end of this, you’ll understand that's not exactly what it happened.

I just... I would do anything for Sarah.

\*\*\*

Sarah always tested my love.

At school, she said I wasn’t allowed to sit near Christina or Kate, so I didn’t. If either of them sat next to me, I’d quietly gather my stuff and move away.

Every morning, she made me walk to her house just to carry her bag to school, and then back again at noon.

She insisted true love was shown through over-the-top letters, so I wrote one every single day. Each one more dramatic and humiliating than the last. She even gave me notes on how to make them more emotional.

Whatever she asked, she got. I was entirely hers.

We were sixteen then, and she was my first girlfriend. I’d never even held a girl’s hand before, and I truly believed we’d last forever.

But things turned dark when she asked me to kill her father.

One day, while we were walking back to her place, she started crying and opened up about how cruel they were. Controlling. Abusive. Evil, she repeated.

Her father was very rich. Their house was basically the size of a city block and had an Olympic-sized pool.

She claimed he was a criminal who made money through loan sharking and extortion. She said he once threatened her, telling her he'd killed women before. “I’m not afraid to do it again if you bring a man into this house,” he warned Sarah.

Through tears, she begged me to do it. “This is the only thing keeping us from being happy,” she sobbed.

So I gave in. I told her I’d help.

\*\*\*

The plan was simple.

Sarah explaind she knew where the cameras' panels were and would turn them off at 2 a.m., making it look like a glitch. That’s when I was supposed to sneak in and head to his room with the knife she’d leave on the kitchen balcony.

“He won’t hear you,” she said. “He takes two sleeping pills every night.”

“What about your mom?”

“She’ll be at my grandma’s this weekend.”

It was the perfect crime, and it felt good that it would be against a terrible person.

All weekend I felt confident. But when the night came and I crept into the house wearing a balaclava, it all went to dust.

Everything was pitch dark, and my heart kept racing. *What if something goes wrong? Can I really kill someone?*

The knife was right where she said it would be, so I picked it up and moved slowly to the room she described.

My hands were shaking when I grabbed the doorknob. I was so terrified I stood there for five full minutes, frozen, and refusing to open it.

My mind screamed for me to leave, but the thought of Sarah’s smile gave me the strength to turn the knob.

I crept toward the bed-shaped outline I saw in the darkness.

Then I felt something wet at my feet. The same slickness covered the bed when I touched it.

I pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight to see the floor was dark red with what looked like blood.

I panicked and stumbled back, still in the dark, to turn on the room’s main lights.

What I saw made me almost puke right there.

There were two bodies in the bed, mutilated by what looked like a hundred stabs. One was a man, presumably her father, and the other was a woman. Her mother.

In shock, I bolted out of the house.

Only outside did I realize the knife I’d picked up was also soaked in blood, like it had been used before I even picked it.

\*\*\*

The next morning, the police showed up at my door.

They dragged me in silence to the station, where they took my photos and checked me in.

It wasn’t until the next day that an investigator showed me footage of me entering and exiting the house the night of the crime, wearing a bloodied T-shirt. The cameras were working fine, it appeared.

He pressured me for a confession. The motive was already “clear as day,” he said.

I did it out of obsessive love for Sarah. They had talked to her, and she shared, in tears, how I refused to accept our breakup and was stalking her. She gave them dozens of disturbing letters sent from me, almost daily. Some of them horrifying.

That’s when it hit me, you know. That she had done it herself. Killed the parents.

I was just the scapegoat.

The officer continued to push and push until I finally confessed it all: *I did it because I wanted to be with her*.

That’s the official version, the one that got me convicted of first-degree murder.

I remember clearly the judge's eyes filled with rage as he listened to the prosecutor talk about how I had taken the life of this local hero who was known for supporting half the orphanages in town.

It was really hard to go through all of that, but even after everything, I never turned on Sarah. I always kept my mouth shut.

“*Why?”* you would ask.

And I’d reply: I told you already.

I’ll do anything for Sarah.
