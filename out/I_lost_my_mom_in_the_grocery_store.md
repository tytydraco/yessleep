I lost my mom in the grocery store. I wandered around the store for what seemed like hours; waiting by the front to see if she’d check out, buzzing her name over the intercom, even tracking her phone to no avail. It said she was still in the store. I’m 18 so no one was too concerned about a lost child.

“She’ll show up,” they assured me. 

“Just take an Uber home.” 

I waited in the store until closing time. She didn’t show. It’s one of those warehouse stores, the ones with the high ceilings and forklifts on the store floor to reach their merchandise. Like a Costco for cheapskates.

I couldn’t believe she would leave me. Not in a “I can’t believe you did this” type of way, but where I know my mother. She’s one of the most anxious people I’ve ever met. If she left the store without me, she would come back apologizing profusely about abandoning her only daughter.

I don’t know what came over me, but I decided to stay past closing. I didn’t have to try too hard to stay hidden. The store was so big and the stacks of merchandise so tall that it was practically inviting me to stow away. 

Hell, I could’ve stayed there for multiple days without being noticed. Maybe even weeks. Had my mother snuck behind and gotten lost? Trapped maybe? 

I watched as the workers finished their nightly routine, and just when I thought they’d all begin packing up to leave a buzz came over the intercom.

They all sprang into action and filed up to the registers, all restless and waiting. The Manager (his shirt was different from everyone else) stood in front of them.

He clapped his hands together and thanked everyone for a successful day.

“And of course, as part of employee appreciation month…” He moved backwards towards his shaded office as he spoke. Using a long key he unlocked the door. When he opened it the most blood curdling, muffled scream erupted from inside. 

I had to come out from my hiding place to see what was inside, but part of me wish I hadn’t. Because inside the office was my mother, tied to an office chair with her mouth taped shut.

He must have sound proofed the room, because until now I had no indication she could’ve been right in front of me this whole time. 

The Manager wheeled her past the group of workers and they all followed suit. I didn’t want to blow my cover, but as they all filed into what looked like a janitors closet I snuck behind them. 

The 30 something employees all entered inside, but they didn’t seem squished. I was hesitant to get any closer, but as I finally neared the doorway I dropped to my hands and knees in terror. 

It wasn’t a janitors closet. It was a kitchen. Inside was the biggest grill I’d ever seen. Flames billowed out as the opened it up. Two men had cut my mother out of her restraints and I watched as she tried to dash to the door, right in front of me. 

I screamed. It echoed. They saw. My mom saw. Before I knew it they had her back under control and shoved into the grill, closing the top and snuffing out her cries. 

A few of the employees poured out of the kitchen and tried to catch up with me, but I had already made it to the front door by the time they started running.

And the worst part is I knew one of the employees. It was my boyfriend. He had been telling me not to worry about her. He told me to just go home. Now he knows I know and I don’t know where to run, but I’m still running. And I can still see the look in my moms eyes when they met mine. 

She knew I’d be next.
