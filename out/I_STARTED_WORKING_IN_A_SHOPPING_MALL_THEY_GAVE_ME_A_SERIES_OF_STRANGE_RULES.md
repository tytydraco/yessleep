First part.  
  
My life has been a series of hopes and disappointments. Since I was young, I dreamed of having an exciting career full of adventures, but reality turned out to be very different. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do after high school, and my parents pressured me to get a college degree. But without a clear passion, I decided not to continue my studies and ended up working part-time at a local supermarket to earn some money. But then I got tired of that place.  
  
With time, I got used to the boring and monotonous routine of my job at the supermarket. My life became a series of repetitive days, attending to uninteresting customers and packing groceries without any meaning. Although I kept dreaming of adventures and challenges, I resigned myself to a life without them.  
  
One day, while walking through the mall after my shift, I saw a sign advertising a security guard position. Although the job didn't sound particularly exciting, I decided to give it a chance; after all, it paid well, and I needed the money. I thought that maybe being a security guard in a mall could have some action and excitement.  
  
When I applied for the job, they strangely didn't ask for a resume or work experience, just whether I was of legal age. I was 24 years old, but my appearance made me look like I was 16. Despite that, I wasn't particularly friendly, of average height, and not very strong. It was common for people to mistake me for a child.  
  
I got the job, and they told me I would work from 8:00 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. They handed me two manuals: one was brown with a ribbon that looked like a bookmark, and it had an inscription saying "Security Guard Manual." I opened it, and everything seemed normal, just a typical work manual with the usual boring rules like strict schedules, regular rounds, prohibition of electronic devices, and so on. I put it away and started watching the instructional training video. Then they gave me the uniform, and I prepared to work.  
  
They assigned me a teammate named Eric. He was a bit stubborn, but overall, he seemed like a decent guy. We began our shift, performing rounds every hour and then returning to the security post. There was a monitor displaying camera feeds from different parts of the mall, some showing staircases, others showing aisles in the stores—everything seemed normal.  
  
There was also a camera showing us in the security room. Around 10:00 p.m., I was looking at the cameras, and one of them had interference. Strangely, I thought I saw a figure on it. "Hey, Eric, look at this! Camera 23 is malfunctioning, and I see something moving. I'll go check it out; you stay here and watch the cameras," I said to him. I checked the map and looked up the location of the camera to head there.  
  
When I arrived, I couldn't find anything strange; everything was calm and quiet. That's when I looked toward the camera—WHAT THE HELL?! I screamed when I saw the camera's location; there was no camera; instead, there was something like a tube made of smooth-skinned meat, in which an eye the size of a tennis ball moved, hazel like a human eye, with eyelashes. The tube swayed, carrying the eye from side to side, and then it fixed its gaze on me.  
  
I started running as fast as I could back to the surveillance room. When I arrived, I could only find my partner Eric lying on the floor with his eyes rolled back and foam coming out of his mouth as he convulsed. "WTF , ERIC!" I shouted, lifting his head to prevent him from choking on his saliva. Then I looked at the camera with interference, and it was only static. I called the administration's number and informed them of what happened. After 30 minutes, they arrived and took Eric, who was in a state of shock, and left another guy in his place.  
  
Later, the manager called me. "What the hell! Can't you guys read? We told you to read the rules!" I didn't retort due to the situation; I just nodded my head. But the manual never said anything about strange things or explained the giant eye I saw. After everyone left, only my partner and I remained; the other guy was not very different from Eric in terms of personality.  
  
He asked me some questions, but I remained in absolute silence, and he probably thought I was just old-fashioned. Then I took the manual and started looking at it. Suddenly, a fabric envelope fell from the book. When I picked it up and opened it, I found a piece of paper in sepia tones that seemed to have been exposed to smoke. I began reading it and froze—the note seemed to contain a series of rules that, upon closer inspection, were quite unsettling.  
  
The note said the following:  
  
All guards must perform a security round at midnight, but they must do it in complete silence and without using flashlights. Any unusual noise or shadow must be reported without mentioning details about its origin.  
  
Guards must never work alone in the mall after midnight. If a fellow guard is absent for their shift, the mall must immediately call the administration to be evacuated until a replacement is found.  
  
If a security camera starts having interference and spots something, immediately turn it off. If you can't turn it off, use a piece of paper to cover the spot on the screen where the camera shows it. Guards must ignore them and never investigate them in person.  
  
Occasionally, guards might see a shadowy figure on the security screens, even if no one is present in the area at that time. If this happens, guards must remain calm and continue with their tasks.  
  
If guards experience strange events during their shift, they must record them in the security report without giving too many details. The report will be sent to an unknown address.  
  
Guards must never use the mall's elevator under any circumstances. It has been reported that some nights, the elevator stops on an unknown floor for no apparent reason.  
  
During the mall's closing process, guards must turn off all lights in an orderly manner. They must never leave unexplained dark areas, and they must never look directly at mannequins or statues that may be in the stores.  
  
If guards find personal objects in unusual places, they must not touch them and must report them immediately to the administration. These objects may belong to visitors who are no longer present.  
  
If guards hear a whispering voice during the night, they must avoid seeking its origin and never respond to it. They must remain alert and report the incident.  
  
Guards may encounter another guard they don't recognize during their shift. They must not ask questions and should simply continue with their work without interacting with them.  
  
If at any time you come across a mannequin that DOES NOT have a navel, you must keep your gaze fixed on it and walk to one of the information booths in the mall. Grope the cabinets until you find a pair of rubber gloves with thick gold embroidery.  
  
DO NOT REMOVE YOUR GAZE FROM THE MANNEQUIN!! Then, approach it and grab its waist with the gloves on, making sure no other part of your body touches it. Then take it to the elevator, call it, put the mannequin inside, use the elevator mirror to press the number - 4, and close it.  
  
If between 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m., you receive a call from me, answer it, and listen to what I have to say. Don't say a single word or respond to any of the questions I ask. When I bid you farewell, you just respond, "Sleep."  
  
I seriously questioned whether I should continue working there, but I needed the money, and assuming that if the note said to avoid the camera, it was to help me, so I stayed. When midnight came, I went out to do the midnight shift with Frank. I told him that we should follow these rules without questioning how strange they might seem.  
  
We went out in complete silence, not carrying a flashlight, and we walked at a brisk pace, perhaps due to fear of walking in the dark. Frank was on one side, and I was on the other, about 20 meters apart. Suddenly, I heard music that sounded like those 50s rock and rolls, but it was distorted as if an old record player that was worn out was trying to play an ancient record. I glanced over at Frank, but it was dark, and I could only see his silhouette. I gestured for him to look at me, but he didn't respond.  
  
The music started to lower in pitch, becoming deeper, and I signaled Frank to turn back. That's when something touched my shoulder, my heart skipped a beat, and I mentally screamed, "I'M DEAD!" When I turned around to see what had touched me, Frank whispered, "We need to go back; I heard a child crying." At that moment, I felt great relief, but also great terror, as the silhouette on the other side wasn't Frank; he was behind me.  
  
The rest of the night passed without any further problems, and the next morning, I wrote a report of everything that had happened. The manager patted my back and said, "Well done, kid. Follow the rules, and everything will be fine." I remembered that I had signed a contract to work here for a month, with a fine if I left; that was the last thing I needed right now.  
  
Tomorrow, I have to go back...
