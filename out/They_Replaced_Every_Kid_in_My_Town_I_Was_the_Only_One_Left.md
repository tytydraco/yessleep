I didn’t realize anything was wrong until my little brother came home without a scratch on him.

That might not sound strange, but Max never came home clean. He was one of those hyper kids—always scraped up, clothes dirty, pockets full of rocks and bugs. But that Friday, he walked in spotless. His shirt was wrinkle-free. His shoelaces were tied. His hair looked…brushed.

I called out, “Max, what the hell happened to you?” and he just turned to me with this blank look. 

He blinked once, then said, “Hello, sister.” Not hey or what’s up or even Mae—just “Hello, sister.” Like he’d read it off a script.

My parents didn’t notice. Or maybe they didn’t care. That night at dinner, he sat up perfectly straight and chewed each bite exactly three times before swallowing.

I joked, “Who replaced my brother with a robot?”

My dad’s fork froze mid-air. “You’re being dramatic.”

They sent me to my room without dessert. I’m sixteen, by the way. Who the hell gets grounded over a joke?

The next day at school, it was worse. Every kid under eighteen moved like they were on delay—just a fraction of a second too slow. The hallways were dead quiet. No gossip. No laughter. Just the sound of synchronized footsteps and the occasional throat-clearing, like they were practicing how to seem normal.

I grabbed my best friend Lily at lunch. She used to be the wild one—dyed hair, piercings, said “fuck” like it was punctuation. But when I said, “What’s going on with everyone?” she blinked twice and said, “We are better now.”

I threw up in the bathroom.

That night, I told my parents I wasn’t going to school Monday. They said I was just tired. My mom made hot cocoa and told me, “The men will be back tomorrow. They’ll help.” Her voice was too calm. Like she was remembering a line from a play she used to love.

Sure enough, the black van showed up again. Every year it came, but this time it stayed parked outside the school for days. No logos. Just a silver eye symbol on the door. One by one, the kids were taken inside.

I was called in on Thursday.

I ran.

I spent all day hiding in the school’s utility closet, crouched between old rolls of sports mats and broken folding chairs. My legs cramped, and I didn’t pee for ten hours. But no one came for me. No one even noticed I was gone.

That night, Max stood in my doorway and watched me sleep. When I sat up, he didn’t move. I said his name. He smiled—too wide. Like his skin wasn’t built to stretch that far. Then he walked back to his room without a word.

I knew then—that thing wasn’t my brother. And neither were the others.

The next morning, I pretended everything was normal. I packed a bag. Waited for midnight. Then I left.

I ran for the woods, where there’s no cell signal. But I’d seen the van heading that way once. Something told me it went deeper than just our town.

I found the clearing around 3 AM.

Dozens of kids stood in rows, unmoving. All of them—my classmates, Max, even the neighbor’s toddler—stared at the black van as its doors slowly opened. Inside, I saw light, but not like anything I can explain. It pulsed like a heartbeat and buzzed with something wrong. My teeth hurt just looking at it.

Then I saw him—the real Max. Buried up to his chest in the earth. Mouth open. Eyes wide. Dead. One hand clutching his favorite toy dinosaur, dirt packed under his fingernails.

I screamed.

Every head turned toward me in perfect unison.

I ran.

I don’t know how long I’ve been hiding. Days, maybe weeks. I haven’t dared go back. I’ve seen the vans in other towns now. They're spreading. I’ve even seen kids on TV with that same too-wide smile, the same mechanical blink.

Stillwater wasn’t the beginning. It was just a test run.

And I’m the glitch.

They’re looking for me now.

I don’t know how much longer I’ll last.

If anyone out there still has real eyes, real blood, real fear—don’t let the vans take you. Don’t let them scan your face.

Because once they do, you won’t come back.

Not really.
