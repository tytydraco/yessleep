I know it's been a little bit (or maybe it hasn't?) but I hope you guys haven't worried about me too much.

It's been a really productive few days lately.

I met someone and he really helped me figure this out.

He also helped me learn a few things that I wasn't aware of.

Some things that scare the hell out of me.

I'm getting ahead of myself here, let me tell you what's happened since I last posted.

I spent several days in GG, the store with the Mother's Day decorations, just getting my head together. You may have a hard time believing this, but I don't often have to attack people in my day-to-day life. Every now and again you may have to bump chests with a rowdy customer at the sub shop, but I hadn't actually had to fight another human being since Highschool. The thought that I might have killed the guy was repugnant to me, and I was afraid to move on to the next one. What if I found another person like that? What if I found a whole tribe of them? The person who had slept below the shelves and prayed they would crush him seemed like worlds away from me, and I found that maybe I did want to keep living. 

After a few days of eating and feeling sorry for myself, I collected up the things that would come with me and stepped through the bathroom door again.

I went back to my usual routine, but finding another person made me think. Was I the only one leaving markings? Was I the only one marking the stores in case I needed to find my way back? I looked around, but I never found anything beyond the usual graffiti or vandalism. Rude words scrolled on the door by the bathroom, sometimes in English and sometimes not. I also found hearts with initials, catchphrases, and the usual things that children do. It meant nothing until I saw something different in KK.

I had been traveling slower, really looking for the signs of other people, and that's when I found the bulletin board.

I knew something was different when I walked into KK. The shelves weren't full like the others had been. They weren't empty, not really, but they were sparse and looked picked over. Things were out of place too. This store had furniture and some of it had been arranged in a way that made me think people had been sleeping close for comfort. The ceiling tiles were hanging down too, something I didn't like, and the music was nothing but harsh static. 

Also, there was a sign written on poster board in the front window.

I blinked at it when I noticed it, thinking it might be mine. Someone had scrolled a similar message on the other side, but this side would only be seen by people already in the store. The writing was messy, scribbled with a magic marker, but it was readable and it filled me with hope that the crazy hermit might not be the norm.

"If you can read this, check the bulletin boards in the break room. When I come back here, I'll answer your message."

It was like a bomb going off in my head and I kicked myself for not looking.

How many breakrooms had I been in? How many times had I used the microwave or opened the fridge to see what was inside? I had passed by the corkboard a thousand times, but never once had I thought to read it. It would be things I had no interest in, things for employees, but it seemed now that might not be the case.

I hurried behind the counter and went to check the board, finding a treasure trove of knowledge.

Their name was Gale and they had pinned a good many things there.

Rules of the DG
Don't go outside, there's nothing out there.
The food runs out, so don't hog it all.
The food doesn't go bad, so don't worry about that.
Whatever you do here, stays here.
Don't go into the ceiling. No one comes back from the ceiling.
Don't be afraid to leave, there's nothing for you here once it's gone.

Another piece of paper had a picture of a big dark creature that had been colored in with a crayon.

The Miasma. Don't let it see you or you'll die. Don't go into the ceiling or it will get you.

The last one seemed to be a goodbye letter and it was in the same handwriting as the others.


I feel bad that I couldn't bury you properly, so let this serve as your memorial. 

Here lies Kenneth, Margo, Rudy, and Celene. They were the best crew anyone could ask for, and I miss them every day. Kenneth who was never late for work and always so full of adventure, lost when he went outside. Margo, so full of life and hope, lost to the thing that lives in the ceiling. Rudy, my son, who wanted more than his old man could give him. Lost in the ceiling when he went to go get Margo. Celene, who always made sure we ate before she would, went through the door when I was too cowardly and hard-headed.
Let this stand as their gravestones. Let this tell their tale. I hope to find Celene when I go through that door. I'm still scared, I'm still hard-headed, but the food won't last forever and I have to do something. If Rudy is out there somewhere, then I'd rather die trying to find him than starving to death in this place.

To whoever reads this, don't be afraid to go through the door and I hope to see you on the other side.

Gale Thorton, Assistant Manager of Dollar General Beyond Story #4891

I didn't know whether I should leave anything or not. This looked like a memorial more than a notice board, but if Gale came back here I wanted him to know that someone else was out there. Paper was easy to come by, ditto pens and I scribbled a hasty introduction before pressing it to the surface with a push pin. It looked lame beside Gale's words, but it was the best I had.

I ate a little of what was left, leaving my mark before moving on.

When I traveled now, besides leaving my mark, I always checked the bulletin boards. 
Sometimes there were messages from Gale, but mostly there weren't. Sometimes there were other messages though. Usually, it was people looking for people or people looking for people who were lost. Some of the bulletin boards looked like the missing walls at rest stops, and two that I saw a lot were someone looking for a boy named Jacob and someone looking for a dog named Buddy.

Looking for my Grandson Jacob. Five years old, blue shirt, blue jean shorts, Sketchers light-up shoes. If you see him, keep him safe. He liked mac and cheese. Disappeared when he went to the bathroom on accident.

Border Colly named Buddy. Black and white with some brown. Blue bandana around neck. Very sweet. Good service dog. Would love to see him again.

The former made my blood run cold, and the more I tried to put it out of my mind, the more it stuck. Jacob. The name the old man had screamed as he lay bleeding. Was he Jacob? Was he the one looking for Jacob? I didn't know, but it didn't matter either. I couldn't get back to him and I had no clue where his Grandson was regardless. 

I would leave notes of my own, letting them know that I was leaving the letters if they came across them and telling them a little about the places I could remember. It was like having penpals, except you were never sure whether they were getting your letters and you had no way to get letters back from them. In that respect, I guess it was more like sending messages in a bottle. 

It went on like that for a little, but when I came to BBB, I found out that someone had seen one of my messages and left a response.

Dear Alphabet Man
Very clever. I like your ingenuity. I'm glad you found the bulletin boards and have figured this place out a little. Hopefully, we can find each other someday. It would be nice to see a friendly face.
Gale

I was thrilled. Finally, someone was responding back to me. I had felt guilty about not trying to communicate with the old man, but this made me feel a little better. If we could get together, we could share knowledge. If we could meet then maybe we could figure this out. I kept going, each new store hoping to find Gale, but each new store seemed to find me a couple of steps behind. He was leaving messages, leaving answers to old messages sometimes, but I never seemed to catch him. Gale and I were moving through this space differently, it seemed, and Gale was better at it than I was.

Gale, I came to believe, could move backward as well as forwards.    

To Alphabet Man
Saw your mark, the one labeled K. Be careful if you find yourself there again. Sometimes there are shadows there that like people a little too much.
Gale

To Alphabet Man
I thought I had gone to the hermit's store for a minute, but I see this may be where you began your journey. Try not to destroy any more of them, they aren't as infinite as you may believe.
Gale

To Alphabet Man
Found your stovetop in the place you call SS. Hope the eggs were good, and thanks for leaving me some.
Gale

This went on for three or four more trips before I found the message I was looking for.

JJJ, the spot I had found myself in, looked very different from the other stores Iâ€™d been to. It looked picked clean, every shelf emptied and bare. Someone had collected a pile of things from the store and attempted to burn the door. It smelled like they had used lighter fluid to start and the ceiling tiles by the door had fallen as they charred and left a wide gaping maw above.

The door, however, was none the worse for wear.

I skirted the edge of the ceiling hole and made my way toward the breakroom.

I didn't expect to find anything, but I was surprised to find the break room still intact.

On the board was a message written on the back of a charred newspaper.

Alphabet Man
I hate to leave you in a place like this, but if you keep to your current path you should be here in a couple of days. Stay here for two sleeps, there is food in the back as well as water, and if I haven't made it by then, it means something has happened and you should move on. With any luck, we'll meet up in two days' time.
Looking forward to seeing you.
Gale.

I read the message a few times, not sure if I wanted to stay here or not. This place was creepy, to be sure, but the chance to meet Gale was something I couldn't pass up. I checked on the food he had mentioned and found several days' worth of water and nonperishable foods that someone had stuck in the back. There was no sign of whoever had set the fire, and I hoped that I had the place to myself. I dragged some bedding and food to the break room, feeling that I'd rather hide in there than in the open, and settled in for the next couple of days. 

I kept the door to the breakroom closed, and if anything moved out there. I didn't hear it the first night.

I mostly rested the next day, glad for the opportunity to do so. I had been going strong for a long time, resting when I was ready to fall down, and it was nice to get a little downtime. I wished it was somewhere a little nicer, but even this place told me things I didn't know. The doors, it seemed, were very resilient, but that made me wonder about Gale's story. He said that Kenneth had made it out those doors, and I wondered how such a thing was possible. The doors seemed unmovable, and the longer I thought about it, the more I couldn't wait to hear his story when he got here.

As I settled in for the second night, though, I heard something groan from the main floor and huddled deeper under my blankets.

It was the exact same sound I had heard as I lay under the shelves and as I listened to it move through the bones of the store, I realized I had trapped myself in my pursuit of safety. If it came in here after me I'd have no way to escape, but if I could make it to the bathroom, I could escape and touch base with Gale some other time. He would understand, especially if this was Miasma, and I pushed the blankets away as I crept towards the door. 

I could hear it moving on the other end of the store, and as I opened the door I prayed it wouldn't squeak.

If it made a noise, it was unnoticed by the creature, and I prepared to make a break for it. Looking around the door frame, I felt my ambition drain away as I caught sight of the creature and knew terror. It was huge, its shadowy form stooped over, and it looked like nothing I had ever seen. It was darkness, a living fog bank of midnight, and as my teeth threatened to clack, glanced at the bathroom and tried to steel myself for my run. 

That's when I saw something that pushed my apprehension away, and I was filled with renewed drive.

Over by the bathroom, peaking around the side of the alcove, was a person in a red vest with a salt and pepper crew cut.

He saw me too, and as he nodded his head, telling me to come there, he tossed something towards the back of the store. The bottle burst with a loud pop and the creature growled like a mudslide. It lunged towards the back, slamming into the back wall, and I took my chance and ran. It heard me then, turning its ponderous form as it tried to give chase, but I was out of its reach.

Gale grabbed my wrist and as we lunged through the bathroom door, the thing was mere inches behind us.

As we lay outside the bathroom, the new Dollar General a pleasant sight after the burnt-out husk we'd come from, the man smiled at me and offered me a hand.

"It's nice to meet you properly, Alphabet Man. I'm Gale, but I suspect you already figured that out."
