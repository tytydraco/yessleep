Every day I meet the Grey Man at the bus stop. I can’t quite remember when it started, but for
years, we have crossed paths. Same time. Same place. Every single day.

Each morning, after I strap on my boots and grab my satchel, I make my way to the corner
where Hunter Street meets Galloway Avenue. There sits a lone wooden bench, riddled with the
faded marks of some advertisement, washed away by decades of rain. Although it's a long walk
from my house, it’s the only bus stop left in the neighborhood. Had the area been more lively,
there might have been more.

It’s always either rainy or foggy, that’s just how mornings here are, but I walk anyway. When I
reach the corner, he is always waiting, just standing almost as stiff as the sign that stands next
to him, surrounded by an unkempt growth of short black nightshade that seemed afraid to grow
any higher than a foot off of the ground. The only way to describe him is the Grey Man. He
wears a top hat adorned with feathered wings that emerge from the laced ribbon wrapped
around its base. He has no face, nor an absence of one. He has a strange way of blending in
with the fog around him. He is the Grey Man.

For years we have stood next to each other in the morning gloom, not speaking a word. I have
grown accustomed to his presence. At least I had. Never once did I think that I relied on him to
be standing beside me as I waited in the limbo before my inevitable departure. Never once did I
think that his absence would lead to the worst experience of my life.

It was one, rather gloomy, September morning, when I left for the bus stop. Something felt
wrong. The bus stop was two blocks down the street, but I already knew, not in my mind, but in
my heart, that today I would not be seeing the Grey Man.

The fog was thicker than normal. It was almost impossible to see even three feet in front of me.
The sky had turned to a deep crimson as if the black clouds had bled out, poisoning the blue
ethereal waters and everything inside of them. The harsh, but distant, rumble of thunder
threatened rain upon the cold earth. All of the plants seemed to wilt and sprout thorns. Every
tree that I passed looked like a devilish hand scorched bark, reaching up towards the tainted
heavens. All of the leaves, weather on the trees or the ground, had seemed to wither overnight,
becoming Grey, ashy, husks. I tried to not pay attention to these things. I tried to focus on
getting to the bus stop. I had to confirm that my suspicions were true.

As I approached the intersection, the emptiness of the area set in. For the first time, the Grey
Man was gone. I was struck with an immediate sense of dread as I crossed the street to the bus
stop. My veins filled with the urge to run away. Every part of me, of my soul, just wanted to be
back home, but I knew that I couldn’t leave.

I sat down on the bench to find that it was completely rotten. Falling through the seat, I was
exposed to the sight of large pink larva, squirming about within the wood. They clustered on
chunks of decayed wood. Slimy translucent film strung them together in a web of pulsating
parasites.

One of the larval creatures burst from its cluster, extending towards my face to reveal that,
behind the layers of goopy raw flesh it had a face, the face of a doll. White with childlike
proportions, the larva’s face was contrasted by two deep voids of sockets, hidden behind its
fluttering eyelids. Its mouth opened to release a dark ichor down onto the others.

I reeled back in absolute disgust, crawling backwards across the dark, decaying grass. I tried to
make sense of what was happening. I tried to rationalize the situation. It was no use. I could find
no answers to my questions.

The stench of rot had breached my nostrils. It was too strong to keep down. I felt the fluid rise in
my esophagus. I proceeded to vomit up that same dark inky secretion into the dead grass. It
melted and merged with the plants to create a hot tar puddle.

Standing up, I realized that I was shaking. I was shaking violently. I looked up towards the sky,
veiled by the swirling fog and dark accumulations. Almost on queue, a flash of lightning and
subsequent thunder signaled the rain to start. The sky, as well, was not free from the dark ichor.
It poured down from the charcoal clouds, flooding the grass, and spreading the reach of the
molten tar.

I tried to run, but my feet were stuck in the boiling black mucilage, forcing me to fall over into the
ring of nightshade where the Grey Man once stood. I stared at the flowers on the poisonous
plants. Flowing ichor dripped from their petals as they began to die. I slowly crawled my way
through the grass, my hands and legs sticking with every movement. I managed to reach out
and grab the curb, which I used to pull myself out of the tar.

I was lying in the street. The dark, heavy rain was coming down even harder, creating syrupy
pools on the asphalt. By that point, my muscles had started locking up. I watched as my hands
turned to a sickly white color. I began to cough up more ichor as I lay there, curled up and
shivering.

I’m not sure how long I layed there before they appeared. It felt like days. Eventually I saw them.
They were large grotesque creatures. They shared the porcelain face of the larva, but seemed
more human in form. Four long wasp-like wings sprouted from their lumpy backs. They only had
two long arms that ended in hands that looked like slimy tree roots. Their abdomens all ended in
an ugly point from which more roots grew.

They appeared in a circle around me, their wings beating in slow motion as they hovered slowly
closer. As the circle constricted the things began to screech in an incomprehensible language.
My ears were ringing. My head began to spin. I felt like I was bleeding from every orifice on my
body. They closed in. The world got dark. I had never wanted to die more in my life.

The creatures fled when the lights came. Piercing through the foggy black rain, were the two
unmistakable beams of headlights. At that moment, I only hoped that the vehicle would put meout of my misery. I saw no other way out of that hell than to become human roadkill, but the
vehicle had different plans. It stopped just short of where I lay on the ground, clearing the fog
around it. The bus had finally arrived.

When I climbed onto the bus, the world seemed to lighten up. The driver gave me a look of
concern as I sat down in a seat. Looking out the window, the sky was its normal grey and the
foliage was looking rather green. I found myself soaked in nothing but water. The bus departed
down the street. I had made it out of hell.

The following morning, everything was back to normal. Light fog crept over the sidewalk, but
never dared to obscure my vision. I made it to the bus stop, where the Grey Man was standing
in his circle of nightshade. I went and sat down on the bench next to him. The bench was now
stiff, as if recently replaced with new wood. I sat for a moment before I spoke.

“Where did you go yesterday?” I said, my voice starting to shake as I remembered the events of the
previous day.

“Why weren’t you here?” Tears were starting to form in the corners of my eyes. I stared at the
Grey Man for what felt like forever before he turned his faceless head towards mine.

“I apologize for my absence. There was something I had to tend to.”

His words were soothing in a way I did not think possible from such an ominous entity. I felt
calmed by his recognition of my pain. He managed to convey all emotion at once without any
expression. He turned back to face the distance.

We haven't spoken since. I don’t even want to. His presence is enough to keep me feeling safe.
To this day, he still meets me at the stop before I head off to work. I silently thank him as I step
onto the bus. I'm not sure what he is, I don't care to know, but I am eternally grateful that he
decided to stand on that corner.
