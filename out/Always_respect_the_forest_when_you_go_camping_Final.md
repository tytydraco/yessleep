[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1466lr5/always_respect_the_forest_when_you_go_camping/)

Two days out here, now. Still nobody coming by. Still no food or water. Still hardly any signal. These posts take almost an hour to upload. I guess I should finish telling what happened. In case I don’t make it out of here, that way it’s recorded.

I took off running after Ivy, and I could hear the ranger walking behind me. He wasn’t running, he seemed to not be bothered by my flight.

By now it was pitch black, and even once I got far enough away to where I couldn’t hear his pursuit, I kept running. I didn’t know where he’d pop out next and I didn’t want-

A loud crack interrupted my thoughts, followed by a jolt of pain. I tumbled to the ground, covering my mouth as I rolled twice. Looking down, I could see that my ankle was twisted at an unnatural angle. I tried to stand on it, and could barely lean against a tree without collapsing again.

I heard rustling from ahead of me, and pressed myself against the tree as best I could. I couldn’t run like this, so hiding was all I had.

A tree branch was pushed aside, and I saw Adam’s curly red hair, before his head ducked down and he stepped towards me, “Hey, hey, just me, Marcy. You’re good.”

He had his hands outstretched in a calming gesture, and I choked back a sob before collapsing against him.

He let me rest there for a moment, before nodding and gently pulling away. “Listen. We’ve gotta get the fuck out of these woods, yeah? Have you seen anyone else?”

I nodded. “Ivy took off this way… somewhere. I don’t know where they went.”

Adam nodded. “We’ll keep an eye out, then.”

We set off through the brush, with Adam supporting me with one arm, clutching a rock in his other hand. It was slow going, but we eventually found a proper trail, which we stuck to. 

Adam nodded again, running a hand through his hair. “Ok, if we follow this, we should be able to get out to the cars, right?”

I just shrugged. He was probably right, but I had no idea how far we’d ran, or in what direction. Who knew where we were?

Light footfalls made their way up the path, and Adam whipped round, rock still in his hand. He forgot he was holding me, though, and flung me to the ground. I hit the dirt with a groan, and he looked at me apologetically, before looking back at the approaching figure.

A small light appeared, and Loretta became visible, dirt smeared against her face. She looked at the pair of us and scoffed, somehow looking smug during all of this.

“What, couldn’t stand being around it either?”

Adam glared at her. “Her, Lory, and no. I just heard someone running up on us and got startled. Maybe move a little quieter and you wouldn’t freak us out.”

She rolled her eyes again as Adam helped me up. “Whatever. We need to move, this path should get us back to the cars.”

Adam scowled, but nodded, supporting me again.

“Right, let’s move then.”

The three of us kept moving for a bit, eventually stopping to rest for a bit. The path continued, with a thick layer of leaves and sticks about five feet from where we stopped. Loretta looked impatient, but stopped with us, tapping her foot the whole time.

“When are you gonna be ready?”

I glared up at her. “Well, my ankle is totally fucked, Lory. So I couldn’t tell you.”

She rolled her eyes. “Well, either you move, or that guy is gonna kill you. And I don’t plan on dying in the middle of nowhere with some freak-”

Adam stood up, cutting her off. “That’s enough. We don’t need any of this shit, Lory. Either shut up or move along.”

She glared up at him. “Uh, I’m the one who found you, jackass. You should be THANKING me.”

Adam cocked an eyebrow. “Fuck this.”

He turned back to me, but Loretta slapped him across the face. He reeled back, not from the impact, but more from surprise. 

“Yeah? What, not gonna hit me back because I’m a girl?”

Adam’s face darkened and he cocked his hand back. Loretta had about half a second to realize what was happening before Adam’s rock collided with her temple. 

Loretta staggered back, and as she backed up over the leaves, they seemed to sink around her feet. She let out a cry as she vanished into the path itself.

Adam blinked and walked over to where she disappeared, gagging when he got there. Struggling to pull myself up, I hobbled over as well.

Loretta had fallen into a pit, probably ten feet down or so. In the pit, there were about a dozen wooden stakes, at least three feet long each. Loretta had found herself impaled on a few. One pierced her left leg, one through her pelvis, one just under her clavicle. She coughed, blood running from her mouth and nose as she looked up at us, before she let out a shaky breath.

Adam looked sick.

I felt sick.

We kept moving.

Going around the pit, we continued down the path. There were no further obstructions as we walked for what felt like hours.

Neither of us spoke. We had nothing left to say at this point. 

Eventually we saw a form lying on the path. A small person, although it was hard to make out in the darkness. We rushed towards it, and saw Ivy laying on the path, seemingly unconscious. 

Adam swore and set me down gently this time, and started trying to wake them up. I heard trees rustling and felt a firm hand on my shoulder. I tensed up as I felt a presence lean down over me, and a familiar voice whisper in my ear.

“I know this here woods better than any of y’all, ma’am. There ain’t no getting away from me.”

Adam whipped around and rushed the man as Ivy began to stir. While not quite the size of the giant ranger, Adam was a big guy in his own right. He charged him, his shoulder colliding with the ranger’s head. The pair of them fell backwards, swinging punches and blows viciously.

I pushed myself to my feet and limped over to Ivy as they sat up, holding their head. I noticed their hair was matted with blood, and I held them, stroking their head gently. 

“Where are we? What’s going on?”

I blinked, then shook my head. “It’s ok, love. We’re getting the hell out of this forest and going to the hospital, ok?”

They nodded, and we both stood gingerly. Adam let out a yell and swung the rock again. The ranger’s feet kicked, seemingly involuntarily, before Adam stopped, breathing heavily. Ivy and I limped over to the two.

The ranger’s face was mangled, one iof his eyes swollen, his nose broken, and visibly missing at least three teeth. There were multiple lacerations on his forehead and cheeks, and his breathing sounded labored.

Adam sat atop his waist, breathing heavily. He looked distraught, and one of his eyes was swollen shut as well. He looked up at us and sighed. “We need to go, before-”

The top of Adam’s head exploded with a loud **BANG**. His eyes rolled back and he slumped to the right, his body falling off of the ranger, who we could now see clearly holding a revolver in one hand, grinning through bloody and broken teeth at us.

We started to back away as he slowly pushed himself to his feet, leaving the gun on the ground. “I don’t like… using those. Disturbs the… beautiful wildlife of… these here woods. But sometimes, you just gotta… regain the upper hand.”

He stalked towards us, his hands twitching as he got closer and closer. I tried as best I could to run, but quickly ended up on the ground due to my busted ankle. Ivy stood over me, and as the ranger got within arm’s reach, they struck out with the broken nail file. The jagged scrap of metal slashed across the ranger’s face, and he winced, turning his head for a second.

Ivy darted around him, their running frantic. They swayed as they moved, but were able to grab the gun off the ground. They leveled it at him, and as he turned to face Ivy, they let out a cry and pulled the trigger…

*Click. Click. Clickclickclick.*

Ivy looked at the weapon, incredulously. 

The ranger growled and charged them, hitting Ivy with a shoulder tackle that sent them flying. 

A soft cry came from the treeline. I screamed as I looked and saw Ivy, feet suspended a few inches off the ground, a tree limb extending from their abdomen. Their hands clutched at it feebly, a bit of blood already pooling at their feet.

The ranger stared at them, shaking his head. “Y’all could’ve avoided this… I just hate to be… doing this.”

I choked back a sob as I crawled towards them. When the ranger hit Ivy, the gun had been flung to the ground. I shakily grabbed it, and making sure to thumb the hammer back, took aim at the ranger’s torso.

He turned, clicking his tongue. He froze when he saw me holding the revolver. The weapon was heavy in my hands, and my grip was shaky. He looked at me and offered a weak smile. “Hey, there, let’s not-”

The gunshot drowned out my screaming.

---

That leaves us here. I shot the bastard in the chest. He slumped over against a tree. I left the bastard there, along with the gun. I didn’t want it. 

I cried, a lot. 

I eventually found my way back to the cars. Slowly, owing to my ankle. Adam was right, the path eventually led back to the road. The cars had been messed with, mine wouldn’t start at all, and I hadn’t thought to grab any other keys from anyone.

I’ve just been curled up in the backseat, hoping for help.

As I’m writing this, I finally hear an engine coming… Hopefully it’s someone who can-

Oh. 

Looking in the rearview mirror, I can see a bloodied figure coming towards me, riding an [ATV.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LobotomyTheatre/)
