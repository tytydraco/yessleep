“The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself.” Ezekiel 18:20 

My father was a good man. We were poor growing up, but he did the best he could, working odd jobs here and there to provide for mother and me. We did a lot of moving around when I was younger, lots of new towns, a new school every year or two. My mother used to say we moved so much because, “Daddy got a new better paying job.” in whatever town we would be moving to next. That was always the excuse but by the time I turned twelve, I had stopped believing the recurring lie. Despite dad’s “better job”, we never seemed to have much money. For most of my young life, we lived off the barest of means. In our home, a bologna sandwich was considered to be doing well. 

 I never really learned why we moved around so much. I always had the feeling dad was chasing something or maybe running from something. Unlike mom's usual excuse, dad would never answer when I would ask why we had to leave again; he usually wouldn't even look at me. He would come home from work one evening and loudly announce, “Time to go!” and mom and I would quickly pack up whatever shitty little apartment we happen to be staying in, and we would be on the road that later that night. 

That was my life for 14 years. Then one day I came home from school and dad's pickup was already home. We were staying in a rundown singlewide trailer house just outside of Joplin, Missouri. It was almost unheard of for dad to be home early on a weekday. I mean sure, there were times he would be laid off from wherever he was working at the time, but he would usually scramble to go job hunting that day, and he almost never took sick days. My concern grew as I approached the house and saw that the trucks driver's side door was standing open, and so was the front door to the house.  

I remember that walk, down the driveway to the house. The absolute silence of the world as my footsteps crunched over the gravel and dirt. The creak of each wooden step up to the small wobbly porch. The feel of the warm breeze that blew through the trailers open door, carrying with it a coppery smell. I saw mom first. I could see her through the open door, slumped down against the wall beside the couch; her knees pulled up to her chest. She was pale and wouldn't look at me, no matter how loud I called to her. She just stared straight ahead, shivering. After summoning up as much courage as I could, I stepped into the house and around the corner, and there was dad. At first, I couldn't understand what I was seeing, I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that this was really happening, that that was dad. He was on his back, on top of the dining room table. His head hung backwards off of the edge, at too sharp of an angle. His eyes rolled in their sockets before focusing on me for the briefest of moments. He tried to speak but all that came out was a sickening gurgle as blood poured from his lips and his throat... God his throat, it was gone. It was like it had been ripped away and flung across the room. Blood coated the walls and ceiling in thick dripping lines. I screamed and turned to mom, trying to shake her out of her shock or whatever was happening, but she just kept staring straight ahead, she never even acknowledged me. 

 I don't remember much after that, but they say I ran to a neighbor's house and got them to call 911. Dad was obviously dead when the ambulance and police arrived. They took mom to the hospital and tried to get her to tell them what she had seen, but I guess the shock was too deep. She wouldn’t speak; she stopped eating, stopped drinking and was eventually admitted to the psyche ward. For years, therapists tried to reach her, to help her to process and talk about what she had seen. Unfortunately, mom never spoke again.  

After the incident, I ended up moving in with my grandparents in El Paso. They had mom moved to an assisted living home an hour's drive from their house. We would go visit her two to three times a week for the first couple of years, hoping and praying that she would come back to us. But she never did. Occasionally she would whistle, but only ever one tune. Grandpa said the tune sounded familiar, but he could never place it; no one could. Eventually the visits became once a week, then every other week, once a month. By the time I was 18, I only saw mom a couple times a year for special occasions. I spent a lot of my free time in therapy, trying to deal with my trauma, but I had nightmares of my dad's face for years, still do sometimes. 

 My life with my grandparents was more comfortable than I could ever have imagined. I had good food, a warm bed every night, and I was finally in school long enough to make real, lasting friendships. And I struggled with the guilt that I was happier with my grandparents than I ever was with my parents.  

Now I'm a relatively happy, stable, and sane 35-year-old history teacher with a wife and a son of my own, despite the trauma I went through as a child. At least I thought I was sane. For the past couple weeks, I've been waking up in the middle of the night with my mother's whistle stuck in my head. On one particularly rough night, Grace told me it could be the manifestation of my guilt for not visiting mom in a while. It made sense, after all I hadn't gone to visit for the past two years. But to be honest, I didn’t feel much guilt. Maybe that made me an asshole, but I was pretty sure she didn’t even know who I was when I did visit. But, I was off work the next day, so I figured I had no excuse to not go for a visit.  

That morning, I filled my coffee cup, got Shawn off to preschool and headed for the Shady Grove care home. I still lived roughly an hour from the home, plenty of time to think on the drive. I thought about how things were when I was a kid, about mom and what she had seen... about dad. The look on his face as his loose neck swiveled toward me. What did he try to say? Who did that to him? What had mom seen? I realized my hand was shaking as I raised my coffee to my lips and did my best to clear my mind of the questions that would probably never be answered. I took a steadying breath and turned up the radio.  

Shady Grove was a very upscale assisted living home, one of the most celebrated in the state, if the banner in the lobby was to be believed.  

“Hi Susan.” I said as I approached the nurse's desk. 

The older woman with big poofy blonde hair looked up and studied me for a moment before recognition spread a smile on her face, “Jim, hi. Wow it's been a while.”  

I nodded, “Yeah well, I've been busy.” Clearing my throat I continued, “How is she?” 

Susan stood up and came around the desk shaking her head, “Oh you know her, she just sits quietly most of the time. Although some of the night staff say she has started whistling more at night lately. Come on, I'll take you to her.” 

“Really?” I asked as I followed, “How long has she been doing that for?” 

“Oh, just the past week or so.”  

That was one hell of a coincidence, I thought as we walked down the sterile white halls, the smell of soiled bed sheets, bleach, and stale body odor permeating the air. I hated this place, it felt like deaths waiting room.  

Finally, Susan brought me to a brightly lit reading room with large windows facing a garden outside. There she was, sitting slumped in her wheelchair. Her once dark brown hair now turned gray, hung down around her shoulders in tangles. I slowly walked across the room, picking up a white plastic chair on the way. Setting the chair next to her I sat down and looked her over.  

“Hey mom.” I said, touching her arm.  

She didn't look at me; she never did. Her vacant eyes stayed fixed forward. Lost in a moment, years ago.  

“Mom, it's Jim. Your son.”  

Still no reaction. I don't know why I always come here expecting anything else. I nodded, “It's okay mom, I'll just sit here with you for a while.” 

We sat and watched the butterflies in the garden for a while. Then I stood and just as I was about to leave, mom started to whistle. When I turned to look at her, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. Her eyes, while still mostly fixed straight forward, had more focus in them than I had seen in years. 

“Mom?” I asked. Bending down to her.  

She didn't answer just kept whistling and looking straight ahead, a single tear broke from her left eye and ran down her face. She was focused on something. I turned to see where she was looking. Out the window, across the garden, in a darkened upstairs window on the other side of the courtyard. At first, I thought I could see something, was it a person? I couldn't tell. But when I blinked, whatever I thought I saw was gone. 

I stopped another nurse as she passed, “Excuse me, could you tell me what's on the other side of the building there?” I asked as I pointed to the darkened window. 

“Oh, that's going to be the therapeutic wing when its finished, unfortunately the contractors are dragging their feet lately.” She answered. 

“So, it’s empty? Theres nothing or no one in there?” 

“Shouldn't be. Unless it was one of the workers.”  

I nodded and turned back to mom as she slowly stopped whistling and went back to her vacant stare. I looked back at the window again but there was nothing there. I sighed and bent down to kiss mom on the cheek. “Goodbye mom, I'll see you next time.” And with that I left Shady Grove. 

That night after dinner and putting Shawn to bed, I spoke with Grace about the visit with my mother while we washed the dishes. 

“Well, it sounds like not much has changed. Do you at least feel better after seeing her?” She asked. 

“I don't know, maybe. On the one hand it was good to see her, but...” I trailed off as I absently dried a plate. 

“But?” Prompted Grace. 

I shrugged, “But at the same time, she’s not her. Not the mother I grew up with. I keep waiting for her to snap out of it. Every time I visit, I walk in thinking maybe this time she will turn and just... speak, say something, say anything.”   

Grace put her hand on my shoulder, “I'm sorry.”  

“I know it's awful, but sometimes I wish that if she can't get better, she could just move on.” I turned to my wife. “Does that make me a monster?”  

She put down her towel and wrapped her arms around me, “No, honey. It just means you just want her to be free, whatever freedom looks like.”  

I smiled, “Sounds a lot nicer the way you say it.” 

Grace smiled back, “Well I'm a little nicer than you are.” 

We laughed and I leaned in and kissed her. And then Shawn started yelling.  

“Momma I had a bad dream!” He cried. 

Grace sighed and smiled up at me, “To be continued.” She said before turning and heading for Shawn’s room, leaving me to finish the dishes. 

 

I woke up again that night, it wasn't the whistling in my head though. You know how when you think you are alone, but then you slowly get that feeling crawling up your spine that someone somewhere is looking at you? It was like that. I sat up and looked around the room but saw only shadows. The clock on the nightstand showed 3:30AM. I lay back down and tried to get to sleep but I just tossed and turned. 

 After a while I decided to get up for a glass of water. I left my bedroom and walked down the hall past Shawns' room, his SpongeBob nightlight illuminating his room in a soft yellow glow. Down the stairs, through the front room, and into the kitchen. I downed one glass and was about to fill it again when I heard it. The whistle. Moms whistle. Only it wasn't in my head. It was on the other side of my front door.  

I froze listening to the whistle for a solid minute before it stopped. It was the exact same tune. I stepped through the house as if on autopilot and approached the front door. Was mom out there? Could she have gotten here? No, no she didn't even know where I lived. My heart was pounding as I looked through the peep hole. But, there was no one there. I pulled the curtain on the front room window aside and looked out but still, I saw nothing. Just the empty street, the neighbor's houses were all dark except for porch lights and the single streetlight on the corner. Was it just in my head? I wondered. Maybe I really was losing it.  

I went back to the kitchen and drank another half glass of water before walking back upstairs and past Shawns' room, Shawns' dark room. I stopped and walked back down the hall and into his room. I bent down next to the outlet, feeling around for the nightlight, thinking that maybe it had fallen. When I couldn't find it, I just shrugged and headed back to bed. Only when I got there, that's when I found the nightlight. It was sitting right there on my pillow. “What the hell?”  

I picked up the nightlight and looked it over, wondering how it had gotten there. I almost woke grace and asked her, but she had to perform surgery in the morning and needed her sleep. I took the nightlight and made my way back down the hall to Shawn’s room to plug it in. If he woke up without it, he would not be getting back to sleep tonight. I plugged in the light then turned and smiled as I looked down at my sleeping son. I was about to head back to my room when I noticed something. Shawns room faced the street, and through his window under the glow of the streetlight was a man. He was a tall thin man, dressed in dark clothes with a long black coat and a wide brimmed hat, concealing his face in shadow. But I could swear I saw the glint of eyes, like an animal's eyes reflected in light, and he was looking right into the window, at me. I stared back for a moment, then the man tipped his hat before turning and walking off into the darkness. 

I grabbed Shawn and took him to my room with Grace, waking her up and telling her what I had seen. 

“Grace, he was in the house I'm sure of it!” I yelled as I pulled my shotgun from the closet and loaded it.  

“Are you sure?” She asked, “Did you see him?”  

Shawn was confused and crying from being woken up and carried roughly through the house, not to mention his half-crazed father shouting and waving a gun around. 

“I didn't see him, but I know he was here, I don't know how, but I know it!” I yelled. 

“Okay.” she said putting her hands on my trembling arms, “Let's just put this down.” She said, taking the shotgun and setting it by the nightstand. “And let's call the police.”  

I nodded, realizing she was right and that I was scaring my son. 

When the sheriff arrived, I told him what had happened and he took down my statement, looking at me pretty dubiously.  

Sheriff Ward had been a longtime friend of my grandfathers; he knew them well and knew my story. 

“So, you're saying that this man broke into your house, moved your son's nightlight and then whistled at your door.” He asked, smoothing his thick white mustache. 

I crossed my arms and dropped my head; this was ridiculous. I was losing my mind. It was probably old trauma from my past rearing its head and making me see and hear things. I felt so embarrassed to have made this into such a big thing. 

Grace said, “Jim says this man was in our house, as crazy as it sounds, I believe him.” 

The Sheriff sighed, “Okay, I'll put out an apb to be on the lookout for anyone suspicious matching your description. And for the time being I'll have a car posted her in case he comes back.” 

“Thank you.” Said Grace.  

I nodded my thanks and we went back inside.  

It was nearly 6:00AM by the time we got Shawn back to bed. Grace had to leave for surgery, and it happened to be a Saturday, so I was off work. I spent the morning drinking coffee and grading papers, and around noon my long-time buddy Ben came over to see how things were going. I told him about what had happened or what I thought had happened over a few beers while Shawn and Bens kids played in the yard.  

“Shits crazy man.” Said Ben, “You think it has something to do with your dad?” 

I looked at him, “What do you mean?” 

Ben leaned back, causing my lawn chain to groan, “Well, seeing as how your dad was murdered when you were a kid, could it be possible that you are seeing things. And you’re having such an extreme reaction to it because you are afraid of being murdered yourself and leaving your son irreparably scarred the way you were?” 

I stared at him for a moment, “Since when are you a fucking psychologist?” 

He laughed, “Hey brother I just call em like I see em.”  

I sighed, “I don't know, maybe you're right, maybe I am overreacting. I should probably make an appointment to see my therapist.” 

Ben shrugged, “Not a bad idea amigo. Now pass me another beer.”  

 

That evening Grace had to work a double shift, so me and Shawn were on our own for dinner. We made homemade pizzas and watched cartoons until the little man fell asleep on the couch. I carried him to bed and tucked him in before heading back downstairs to watch reruns of the twilight zone. 

I had just sat down with my bowl of popcorn as Rod Sterling was wrapping up another episode, when I heard something hit the back door. I looked but I couldn't tell what had made the noise, so I got up and walked over to the back door. “What?” There, just outside on the ground, was Shawn's nightlight. I turned and ran upstairs as fast as I could to check on Shawn, I knew that the light was there when I tucked him in.  

When I got to his room, I saw that he was fine, he was fast asleep. I walked to my room and grabbed the shotgun before heading back downstairs. 

I flung open the door and walked out into the yard raising the shotgun, “Where are you? You son of a bitch! Come out and face me!”  

Then I heard it, a voice, a deep and raspy voice. And it was singing,  

“Oooh death 

OoOh death 

Wont you spare me over til another year” 

My heart froze, the tune... that God damn tune. It was what my mother had been whistling for the past 20 years. I turned in the direction of the voice, and the man stepped out of the shadow of a small tree near the edge of my yard, a shadow far too small to fully conceal him. He was twenty yards away when I raised my shotgun.  

“Who are you?” I yelled.  

The man laughed 

“What do you want?” I demanded. 

The man just laughed and smiled, even from that distance I could see there was something wrong with his teeth. 

“You take one more step and I'll shoot.” I shouted at him. 

He stopped and flung his arms out to the sides in a “Here I am” gesture before continuing forward.  

“I mean it, I'll kill you!” I yelled. 

But he just kept coming, so I fired. Only he wasn't where I was aiming anymore. He was off to the left, so I adjusted my aim and fired again, but he wasn't there either. He was off to the far right, so I took aim and fired again. But again, I missed and in the next moment he was right in front of me. I fell back to the ground just as one of the deputies came running around the side of the house. 

“What the hell are you shooting at?” He yelled. 

In my panic, I had forgotten about the deputy parked out front. I turned back to where the man was, but he was gone. What could I say? I couldn't very well tell him I was shooting at a ghost, even if that's what if felt like. My sanity was already up for debate as far as the sheriff's department was concerned.  

I shakily got to my feet, “Opossum, big Opossum. They like to dig through our trash.  

The deputy shook his head, “Well did you get him at least?” 

“No.” I said looking around the yard, “No, I guess not.”  

For the rest of the night, I sat up in Shawn’s room, my shotgun across my lap, for all the good it had done. When Grace finally made it home, it was nearly 4:30AM. I told her what I had seen and from the look on her face, I could see that she wanted to believe me. But even I knew how it sounded.  

It took some doing but I managed to convince her that maybe I just needed a few days on my own to get my head straight. That morning, she packed up bags for her and Shawn and went to stay at her mother's house for a couple days. I stood in the driveway and waved them off before heading back inside for my car keys. I needed to take another trip to Shady Grove. 

When I arrived, I found mom in the same brightly lit reading room, facing out the same window. Again, I pulled over a chair and sat next to her. 

“Mom, it's Jim. I really need you to talk to me.” I could hear the desperation in my own voice as I pleaded for her to talk. 

“What happened to dad?” I asked, leaving the chair and kneeling down in front of her, “What did you see? Was it a tall thin man?” 

I was answered only by silence and the same vacant stare she always had. 

“He was in my house god dammit!” I erupted. “My son, your grandson, may be in danger! Fucking say something!”  

“Sir.” said one of the nurses approaching from behind me. “You’re gonna need to lower your voice or...” 

“Yeah.” I said interrupting, “Sorry, I was just leaving.” 

I stood and started for the door, then a thought occurred to me. I turned and walked back to stand next to mom. 

“Ooh death.” I began to sing, “OoOh death.” 

And then something happened, something I never thought I would see. Mom slowly turned her head, her eyes widening as tears began to pour down her face. Her lip quivered as she took a sharp inhale of breath, and then she began screaming. Nurses quickly gathered around, pushing me back and taking my screaming mother away. 

30 minutes later, an orderly came and found me sitting numbly in the reading room. “Sir?” 

“Yes?” I said standing up, “How is she?” 

“She’s calmed down now, we’ve given her a mild sedative, she wants to speak to you.” 

The words hit me like a freight train; “She wants to speak to you.” The words I had prayed to hear for the past 20 years, but had given up on. I wordlessly followed the orderly to her room and there she was. Her eyes fluttered up to me as I stepped through the door. Tears burned in mine as she tried to smile. “Hi mom.” I said. She weakly waved me closer, and I knelt down by her side, taking her hand. 

“Jimmy.” She said, her voice was weak and small with disuse.  

“I'm here mom.” I said. Leaning close. 

She leaned forward and whispered in my ear, “He’s coming for you, now.” She smiled sadly as tears ran down her face. 

“Who is he?” I asked. 

She shook her head, “Run if you want, hide if you can. It won't matter in the end.” 

“What are you saying? Run and hide from who?” 

“Find your father's family, they will tell you. He didn't know until it was too late.” 

“Tell me what?” I asked “I don't understand. Who is he?” 

She smiled that same sad smile and put her hand on my cheek, “He’s death.” 

And with that she turned away and closed her eyes. I tried to wake her, but the nurses quickly ushered me out. “She needs her rest.” one of them said, “We will call you if anything changes.”
