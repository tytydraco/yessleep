I've long been a fan of the unexplained. I enjoy listening to podcasts of the spookiest sort, especially this time of year and when I'm trying to get to sleep. I'm one of those people.  

However, I have a few things that I tend to avoid plumbing the depths of because they really unsettle me. The Hat Man is one of them. He just freaks me out, and I give him all the due respect that I can. I've experienced light flickers when there's been no electrical problems and strange animals have shown up and watched me.

Unfortunately, I started researching what is referred to as the "whisper field" in some circles. There's precious little most people know about it, even though it has been touched upon academically and by governments. A web search on the topic just turns up a random, unsettling Soundwave posting. 

Fortunately, as a poor postgraduate, my skill set includes finding ways to access all the old and forgotten academic sources that not even Jstor is willing to archive. The deep spaces of the UCLA Library smell exactly like you would expect, with some aromas that are best not spoken of.

I've collected a little on the whisper field, even though if you go to official sources to dig up references, you'll probably get turned away. It took me a lot of work to find information about this. And I wish I hadn't started searching. 

**History of the Whisper Field**

In the mid 1950s, a series of scientists allegedly discovered a naturally occurring phenomenon they named the "whisper field," a low-frequency soundwave that emanated from deep beneath the Earth's crust. The wave itself was imperceptible to human hearing, but over time, anyone exposed to it would begin to hear faint, unintelligible whispers. At first, the whispers were only heard in moments of silence, but eventually, they would grow louder, merging into a chorus of distinct voices.

The phenomenon was first recorded in 1956 by Dr. Edgar Blevins, a geophysicist investigating anomalous seismic activity. Blevins' team were initially measuring infrasound waves, extremely low-frequency soundwaves (below 20 Hz) that can’t be detected by the human ear. Infrasound is typically produced by natural events like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and even large weather systems, but what they discovered was far more unsettling: a persistent, low-frequency wave—around 3 Hz—that didn’t correlate with any known natural source.

Unlike other infrasound waves, which dissipate or get absorbed by the atmosphere, this particular wave appeared to increase in intensity as it traveled along the medium of fault lines.

Research on infrasound has shown that frequencies between 7-10 Hz can cause feelings of unease, anxiety, and even hallucinations due to the resonance of these frequencies with the human body, particularly the inner ear and brain. However, the "whisper field" operates at an even lower range, which led Blevins to theorize that the wave subtly interferes with neurological functions over time. Extended exposure appears to alter the brain’s alpha and theta waves, which are responsible for relaxation and daydreaming states. This interference seems to trick the brain into perceiving sounds that aren’t there, which could explain the "whispers" described by those affected.

While traditional infrasound is usually caused by surface-level events, the whisper field is believed to originate from a deeper, as-yet-unknown source beneath tectonic fault lines. Some theorists have posited the existence of sub-crustal fluid flows or magnetic anomalies deep within the Earth’s mantle that generate this persistent wave. Others speculate it could be linked to ancient, undiscovered volcanic structures that release subtle vibrations through crystallized magma channels.

By 1961, studies showed that individuals exposed to the whisper field for over three months experienced progressive cognitive decline. The whispers began as background noise, typically dismissed as wind or distant murmurs, but as exposure continued, they became clearer and took on the characteristics of distinct voices, often addressing personal fears or regrets. Brain scans of these individuals revealed abnormal activity in the auditory cortex and hippocampus, regions associated with sound processing and memory formation.

The temporal lobe, particularly the amygdala and hippocampus, have been known to react strongly to low-frequency sound. These regions of the brain are tied to emotion and memory, and as exposure to the whisper field persisted, subjects began to experience auditory hallucinations linked to deeply personal events, sometimes resurfacing memories they had forgotten. This suggests that the wave interacts with neural pathways in a way that mimics certain psychoactive substances, causing the brain to distort its perception of reality.

Over time, those affected by the whisper field reported vivid, unsettling dreams, often featuring themes of drowning, being buried alive, or being surrounded by shadows. This disruption of normal sleep cycles was theorized to be the result of the wave affecting the brain’s delta wave production, responsible for deep sleep. Sleep deprivation, combined with the auditory hallucinations, exacerbated feelings of paranoia and aggression in many victims.

In 1965, after several instances of mass hysteria in mining towns located near fault lines, the British Geological Society commissioned a secret task force to study the phenomenon. They hypothesized that the wave could be artificially amplified or disrupted using electromagnetic fields, a theory based on the known interaction between sound waves and certain electrical fields. A series of classified tests were conducted using massive Tesla coils, attempting to generate high-frequency electromagnetic pulses to cancel out the wave.

These experiments failed catastrophically. Not only did they fail to disrupt the whisper field, but they also appeared to exacerbate the effect, intensifying the hallucinations, causing dangerous sleepwalking, severe personality shifts, and driving some test subjects to violence. One report indicated that the voices became louder and more coherent immediately after each attempt to disrupt the field, leading to a new, chilling hypothesis: that the field wasn’t just a passive, natural occurrence. It might be responding, as if it were somehow aware of what researchers were doing. Even though that was clearly impossible.

More recently, organizations like CERN and deep-earth observatories have picked up faint signatures of the whisper field, but due to its low frequency and wide distribution, it remains elusive. Some fringe researchers speculate that the whisper field might be connected to the Earth’s shifting magnetic poles or could even be an echo of a primordial large scale underground life form, dormant beneath the surface for millions of years. There are also rumors that governments have deliberately suppressed research into the whisper field, fearing the social and psychological implications of its discovery.

To this day, the "whisper field" continues to defy scientific explanation. Those who report experiencing it note that the voices always seem to know intimate details of the listener's life — secrets they had never shared, regrets they had long buried. Most unsettling of all, some have reported that the voices in recent years sound closer, no more urgent and seem to no longer be talking about the past, but rather something forthcoming.

My sources are available to anyone who wants them, but I would like to mention an account I obtained from the eldest sister of a young man named Gabe Fuentes. What happened to Gabe wasn't formally reported by the authorities and was otherwise kept quiet at the request of his family and other groups involved. She was able to provide me with the transcription of the notebook found with Gabe's handwriting. The text is included below. 

Transcription of the last surviving, legible notes from Gabe Olivio Fuentes’ notebook

Recovered near Dyea, Alaska — October 17, 2018


[August 15, 2018]

Dyea, Alaska — Weather’s perfect for the hike. This place is so quiet next to Skagway. You can hear the past whispering in the wind. Dyea’s just ghostly now. Very few people left. Only a few ruins from the old Klondike Gold Rush days. Crazy to think this was once a bustling town where thousands set off for the Chilkoot Trail. Now it’s just nature reclaiming whats hers. Gonna head up toward the old mining area. Maybe I’ll stumble on something interesting.


[August 16, 2018]

Got deeper into the mountains. Dyea’s behind me now, and the trees are thick. It’s almost too quiet. I stopped for a bit, but when the wind died down, I swear I could hear… well, something. Faint, like the sound of a creek, but no water in sight. Probably just the wind through the trees. Moving on tomorrow. The old Klondike mining camps should be close.

Side note: weird how this area’s basically erased from history. Most people don’t even remember Dyea was the start of the trail. It’s all Skagway now. I wonder why they abandoned it so fast.


[August 17, 2018]

Camped out at the base of an old mine. Definitely feels abandoned, but... not in the way you'd expect. There’s something here, though. I keep hearing this low, droning sound coming from deep in the ground. Thought it was machinery at first, but it’s too rhythmic? Constant. Almost like a hum. Might be some natural thing, like minor earthquake tremors or wind through the tunnels. This place is really geologically active but I'm just guessing. It’s unsettling.

Sat by the fire tonight. Heard something in the distance. Thought it was an animal at first. Then realized it wasn’t any kind of animal I know. No growls, no howls—just... soft voices?

I’m so exhausted. Gonna crash for the night.


[August 18, 2018]

The whispers started again. They’re not in the distance anymore. They’re closer. I thought it was my imagination. Must be the low, grinding sounds or something, like they talk about with old mine shafts. The earth does funny things. Maybe I’m just tired, right?

Still... last night, I could have sworn I heard my name. Not loud. Barely a murmur. Gabe... Gabe... Nothing clear, just a whisper on the wind. There’s no one out here, though. No one for miles. That hum from underground is louder now too, constant. I feel it vibrating in my chest. Like it's pressing on me, maliciously. 


[August 19, 2024]

Couldn’t sleep. The whispers are definitely louder. Sometimes they’re just sounds, sometimes... words. I don’t know how to explain it, but it feels like they’re speaking just under my hearing, like I’m catching only fragments of what’s being said.

The wind doesn’t blow much anymore, but the sound is everywhere. Like the earth itself is talking. Is that possible? Hell, I don’t know. Maybe the isolation’s getting to me. Maybe I’ve been out here too long. I was about to turn back, but… I don’t know, something keeps pulling me forward.


[August 20, 2024]

They’re saying my name again. Gabe. Gabe. But it’s not just whispers now. It’s… clearer. I went back to the mouth of that mine, just to check it out, and I swear I heard something from inside. Not echoes. Not wind. Voices. Hundreds of them. I tried to rationalize it—just the way sound travels underground, right? But they keep calling my name.

I keep thinking about how Dyea was abandoned so suddenly. Did they know about this? No one talks about it. They left, and now no one comes back. Weird.


[August 21, 2024]

Theyre all around me now. Cant tell whats real anymore. My name. My voice. Their voices. It’s har to write. Everything feels slo. Heavy. I need to get out of here, but I don’t think I can anymore. The hum—its inside me now. Cant stop hearing it. The whispers dont fade even when I cover my ears they in me everywhere.

Tried to leav got lost cant find the trail the voices know all about me but I'm afraid of what im thinking theyre not just whispers anymore theyre speaking to and through me


[August 22, 2024]

Im not alone theyre here the air feels thick I can feel im watching my own my own voice doesn feel like mine anymore I tried to scream but the sound came out wasn't mine it wasn't a sound of that it wasn't it wasn't it was them I hear myself speaking but it's not me speaking im not speaking anymore I cant

I have to go down I have to go down deep deeper and I donnt know why and what im looking for anymore what am I doing here why am I here why am I out in the forest I shouldn't of come I should've gone home mom dad I'm so sorry I don't know what im doing I shouldve gone home im so sorry mom i love you


[August 23, 2024]

The mine is dark its so dark so dark down here I can feel the ground breathing its breathing its breathing against me the ground is breathing I don't know whats my voice and what whats theirs anymore everything is blending together the hum is inside my head its all in my head but its not its there its real theres no no no nothing different between the wind the whispers and my thoughts it's all the same theyre all the same we are all the same

its getting hard to see they told me to leave the notebook here if you find it tell my mom that I hope Stella is okay im sorry you have to feed her now but I have to go I have to go I'm sorry I just have to go ill miss you but 

my voice is theirs now

**[End of Transcription]**

Gabe Fuente's body was never found. The journal was recovered near an abandoned mine entrance in the Dyea region. No further searches were conducted due to increasingly dangerous weather conditions and strange auditory phenomena reported by the search team, several of whom never reported back to the group. Their whereabouts are still unknown.

...Oh yes, the Mariana Trench. An old professor of mine who is into deep sea research told me about an incident earlier this year involving an exploration of the trench. 

With all the other incidents in recent years, this one didn't get much traction. I'm torn between whether to dig deeper into this or just let it go. 

But I've told others, and I'm sorry for that. As soon as I started talking to my friends about what I was researching, they started to hear strange things when out in nature. One of them will never talk to me again because he used to love going on hikes, and now he can't do it, especially at night.

Of course, I've heard the whispers too. I live near one of the biggest fault systems in the world. I can ignore them most days, and they just feel like a persistent, low-grade headache clawing against my skull. Sometimes they sound like my mother with all the judgment and disappointment laid on thick. Other times, they just sound like me and all the voices I usually try to shut out. 

I don't know how much longer I can keep going, but I need to know... What it is and why... 

Even if it kills me.
