My Grief Counselor is a Clown

   For the past few years I have been spiraling deeper and deeper into a dark pit of depression. It took a while for me to admit it but after my second attempt at ending myself I realized that my mother was right. It wasn’t a woe is me, life is stupid and pointless thing. Abuse, bullying and an empty purposeless mindset tucked me into a stiff belief that I was truly deserving of any and every horrible act done to me. Now don’t get me wrong. I’m not all cured and magically happy and shit. I’m just a bit more aware of where I’m at mentally. I need help.

   The psych rehab center I’m at isn’t all that bad. Couldn’t help but picture dudes in straight jackets drooling and beating their heads on the ground but it’s not like that. Some truly need to be here more than me but others are pretty chill with decent conversation. It’s a cold bland building. The walls are white with muted tones of grey blue and brown only noticeable because of the harsh fluorescent lights overhead. The hum of those damn things alone could drive someone to madness. The nurses are kind and soft spoken but examine you closely looking for anything you might have that could hurt you or someone else. I could be holding a fingernail and they’d rip it away from me like a knife from a toddler. 

   Before and after my second attempt, where I tried the ol multi pill express exit, I’ve seen several psychiatrists, analysts and whatever but none stuck. Today I was lying on my bed staring up at the industrial ceiling tiles when there was a knock at the door. A nurse let herself in. “Hey there, Thomas. How are we feeling today”? I stared blankly at her and dropped my head back into my pillow. “I’m fine, thank you”. She proceeded into the room and stood over me. “We’ll be skipping today’s group session. Instead there is a new grief councilor you’ll be visiting. I’m not sure who suggested him for you but his credentials are in order and the doctors believe it could help. We’ll have to drive you of course but his office is close by and he’s ready to see you as soon as possible”. With a heavy sigh and closed eyes I rolled to my side and replied “Can’t wait”.

   After thirteen minutes in a van smelling like old people and Lysol we arrived at our destination. The heavy set orderly, Robert, let me out and walked me to the door. He’s a good guy. Harsh but real. “I’ll be here waitin, alright? Try n let the man help you. Don’t be a dick”. He gave me a playful nudge on the shoulder and walked back towards the van lighting up a cigarette. The office was a small one story brown brick building. Looked like I could literally run four laps around the thing in three minutes or less so obviously this dude isn’t doing very well for himself if he works out of this glorified shack. I grabbed the doorknob and was greeted with a sharp shock that made me throw my hand back in surprise. Behind the door I could swear I heard a distant chuckle. Shrugging it off as static I grabbed the knob again, turned it and walked inside.

   The door closed behind me and echoed as if I were in a stairwell. In front of me was a long narrow hallway leading to a red door. The walls were covered in mirrors. Mirrors that I quickly recognized as those wavy distorted ones you’d see at a carnival or something. It was a long, quiet and downright unsettling walk. I opened the door to a small waiting room painted in a horribly bright yellow color. The floor had large different colored polka dots that got progressively smaller the closer they got to the help desk at the far right corner of the room. There was music playing but it must’ve been on the lowest volume possible. It sounded like one of those American Fotoplayers, cartoonish and chaotic. 

   I approached the desk and called out. “Hello?.. I think I have an appointment here.. hello”? The little space behind the desk appeared untouched. Clean and polished with a laptop and small black file cabinet. To my left next to a large pump bottle of hand sanitizer there was a long trumpet horn like you’d see on an old bicycle with a note saying “honk for help”. 
“Are you serious”? I thought. I picked up the horn and with a frustrated sigh gave it two quick honks. Immediately I was greeted by a full grown chimpanzee that shot up from behind the counter. “JESUS, FUCK”! I yelled out while flinching backwards. The chimp stared back at me unfazed. He made a series of oohs and grunts, placed a sheet of paper with a pen on the counter and tapped it with his knuckle. Frozen and with my jaw practically hanging to the floor I couldn’t react, my entire being shut down, I’ve never been face to face with an ape that could literally eat my face off. I just stared. The chimp nodded eagerly and tapped his knuckle to the paper once more while adjusting a large purple bow tie around his neck.

   I quickly averted my eyes. I don’t know monkey manners but don’t these things freak out with direct eye contact? Or is that just gorillas? I nervously reached for the paper. It was all the basic info you’d expect. Number, email, insurance info. I began filling it out and could see in my peripherals the chimps toothy grin growing larger. I handed it back quickly and he made some cheerful oohs as he opened up the laptop and began slapping the keyboard like it was covered in ants. I couldn’t help but stare in bewilderment when he suddenly stopped what he was doing, glanced up at me and pointed to a small chair in the far opposite corner of the room. I gave out a shakey and confused “thank you” and made my way to the chair.

   I got half way there when I had the thought of just running out the door I came in. “Yeah to hell with this, I’ll just.. I’ll just run out and say no one could help me, yeah. What if that thing fuckin chases me down thou-“. My thoughts were interrupted by the chimps quick screech. I jolted my head around to see him wave and point over to a large ornate dark wooden door. I looked back and forth between him and the door. Was that there this whole time? I must’ve been too distracted to notice but it was too distinguished from everything else how could I not have seen it. The music seemed to grow louder as I walked towards it. I gripped the handle and noticed at my feet the polka dots on the floor were now smaller towards it. As if they were actively shifting in the direction I was meant to go. 

   I entered the room and all sound but my footsteps had fled the world. It was a large and beautifully sophisticated room. Painted in a soft dark green, decorated with fancy dark wooden furniture, books on every wall, intricate rugs and soft inviting lounge chairs. Sitting in the middle of the room across from where I was clearly meant to sit was a clown looking at me calmly with a soft smile. He stood up and gestured to the seat across from him. He was very tall with blue hair stretched out on the sides, red nose, painted white face and red around the mouth. He wore a baggy green and white suit with a glittery yellow bow tie and puffy white gloves. He spoke with a deep comforting voice that rang with an air of wisdom and intelligence. “Thomas! It’s a pleasure to finally meet you. Please have a seat and let us get better acquainted”. I sat down and he reached out his hand to me. “My name is Dr. Boingo McBoingerton”.

   It felt like a lifetime before I responded. I think the chimpanzee drained any surprise I had left in me. At this point a sophisticated clown seemed oddly normal. “Hey I’m uh- it’s nice to meet you”. I grabbed his soft foam like hand that felt more like a firm pillow than flesh and bone and was given a sharp buzz to my palm. I yanked my hand back “Ouch man, seriously”? He chortled and sat back down bringing his leg up across the other knee revealing his stupidly large polka dotted shoes. The chimpanzee burst into the room bringing a large folder to the clown. “Ah yes thank you, Mr Banana. That’ll be all”. The chimp playfully slapped the floor as he made his way out. He then opened the folder covering his face making the occasional mhmms and ahhs. His blue hair, the only thing visible from behind the folder, seemed to move up and down in response to his tone. 

   He clapped the folder shut, his face now yellow. “Thomas may I call you Tommy”?
“Actually sir I’d prefer Thomas”.
He leaned forward, his fingertips gingerly pressed together. “Listen Timmy, your sessions here will be a tad different from what I’m sure you’re used to by now”.
“Yeah I kinda figured that would be the case”. I laughed.
He gave a puzzled look. “What do you mean”?
“Well you’re a.. and there’s a.. it’s just yeah very different already… sir”. His heavy eye contact made it difficult to finish a thought confidently. 
“Yes well you know the old saying about the definition of madness I’m sure”. He chortled again. “Sometimes a goal is best accomplished by using the most unconventional methods”. 

   “Before we begin can I get you anything? A drink perhaps”? I nodded. “Some water would be great”. He stretched his lapel and a spritz of water struck me in the mouth. I spit with my lips pressed tightly and wiped away my face. I reopened my eyes to see him holding a large magnifying glass over the inside of my arm examining the large scar running up it. I ripped my arm away and he calmly leaned back into the chair and began taking notes, his face now blue. “Many individuals reach a point in their lives where the only true control they feel they have is over their own physical pain. When and where they feel it. It might not seem like it, Tod, but to me choosing to do harm to one’s self rather than others in our darkest moments is a sign of true compassion for other living souls. You are a very caring person and I’m sure you’re all too aware that self harm is not the answer here”.

   I was admittedly taken back by his words. He rolled up his sleeve revealing his incredibly thin pale arm and naked wrist. His bow tie spun and made a whirling sound. “Wowza would you look at the time. I’m afraid that’s all we have for the day. Mr Banana will schedule you for our next appointment”. 
“But it’s only been like 10 minutes”. I said.
He walked me to the door and I went to the monkey behind the desk. 

   With a massive smile it handed me a card and waved me away. In a haze of confusion and disbelief I made my way to the exit when I looked at my card. Written in bold red lettering was the word “Now”. The clown slammed open the door. “Ahh yes Tommah Bahama! So good to see you again, please come sit”! For the next hour it all felt like an actual legitimate therapy session accompanied though by the occasional nose honk and sliding whistle. I’ll admit to almost laughing at times despite talking about some of the most traumatic moments of my life. We covered my abusive father that left at a young age, alcoholic but sympathetic mother, isolation throughout my school life with zero friends and classic bullies. We ended with my feeling of no drive, goals or any idea or care about what to do with my life. He took extensive notes and it felt like he genuinely cared. 

   A massive cuckoo clock in the room went off and the Dr put his notepad down. With a pink face he stood up. “Thompson this has been an excellent session. I feel like we’re on the right path for some big changes”. He walked me to the back of the room. “I’m a firm believer in exposure therapy and with your permission I would love to dive deep into some of these exercises during our next visit”. I nodded in agreement. “Yeah that sounds fine by me”. His smile stretched unnaturally and for a moment the pink of his face dimmed reddish in color. Outside the room I could suddenly hear the distant muffled sounds of the chimpanzee screaming. “Fantastic. You can exit the building from here”. He gestured to a hole in the wall that seemed to be a plastic slide. I didn’t really want to use it but his sharp gaze and overwhelming presence made me feel like this was my only option. I hesitantly climbed in and slid down the steep slide. 

   It was a quick slide down and I dropped out of the ceiling onto my feet in front of the red door. I was back in the hall of mirrors. I stared up at the hole for a minute trying to make sense of how that worked out. I made my way out of the building and headed back to the van. Robert was leaning on the side enjoying a drag from his cigarette when he noticed me. “What done already”? 
I opened the door to get in. “What do you mean”?
He spoke through a thick cloud of smoke. “Next time let me finish a damn cigarette before you up and abandon an appointment“. Unsure what to make of his remark I hopped in and waited for him to drive us back. I felt something in my pocket and pulled out a small card with the date and time of our next appointment. It would be in three days at noon.

  The next day I had gotten a call from my mom. She was proud of me for getting help but I could tell she had already been through a few glasses of wine from her slurred speech. “Oh my God, hun guess what, your skank of a cousin Suzy is pregnant again. That makes three kids and three fathers ahaahaa! Your aunt really failed with that one”.
“Yeah mom… Sure sounds like it”. I heard her take a quick sip before continuing. “Oh your Doctor called by the way”. 
“My what”?
“Your Doctor! Dr. Bongo or something like that. Sounded so dreamy haha we spoke for a while”. I leaned up out of bed.
“What did he want to know”?
“He wanted me to tell him about your father and that awful Jacob Thompson from the ninth grade, remember him”?
“Yes mom”.
“The boy who would beat you up all the time and made the whole school believe you had aids, remember him”?
“YES MOM! Obviously I remember”!
“Alright, geez. Well he just wanted some more details that’s all”. 

   I hung up frustrated and a little upset at the clown. Then again he hinted from the start that he used unconventional methods. I’ve got nothing to hide anyways. Seems like all he really learned was a few names. Fast forward to appointment day. It’s all the same as before. When I entered the waiting room The chimp looked pleased to see me. He swayed back and forth oohing and waving a sign in sheet at me. I approached more comfortable than before and wrote down my name, date and time of day. When he took back the sheet I saw that his hands were stained with faded red splotches. He slapped the counter hard snapping me out of my fixed gaze and pointed to the clowns door. I headed to the door while he began jabbing a pencil down onto a stack of papers scribbling hard. I was about to enter the room when I noticed the dotted floor. This time the dots were large where I stood and they were smaller leading to the exit. Was the room telling me to leave? “Travis! Is that you out there? Please please come in”. My attention was brought back to the door and I entered the room. 

   Hanging from the ceiling was a large misshapen ball wrapped like a present. “Good afternoon Tom, please have a seat”.
I sat down and was surprised by a flappy farting sound from the cushions. “Wooaaaahhh”! He said twirling some kind of spinning noise maker in hand. “Wish I had a window to open in here”! I pulled a whoopee cushion out from under me and tossed it over to the trash can unamused. “Oh cheer up my boy, can’t be worse than having full blown aids am I right”? I stood up. “What did you say”? He darted over with a gray face and placed his hands on my shoulders. “Forgive me for prying, Thomax. To truly heal I must be alongside you in the deep end so that we may swim out together. Jacob was a real devil in his treatment of you. The beatings and the manipulation to not only alienate you but to form the foundation of the lie that you are and will always be alone”. He honked his nose and stepped away. 

   “Let us take a mental step back in time. A young man in a new environment with everything to prove and lose at any moment. Jacob thought that to tear you down would build him up. A misguided and cruel child. You deserved none of it, son. The shame should lie with him. Those who participated. Those who saw and said nothing”. He placed a colorful bat in my hands. “Healing involves great discomfort”. He walked over to the hanging present and ripped the wrappings off. I clinched the bat in terror. Tightly stretched across a giant ball of confetti and candies was the flayed skin of Jacob Thompson. Like silly putty around a rock. “Is this real”? I asked through frantic breaths. The clown blew a sliding whistle in a low note. “Noooo hahaha no nooooo, definitely not”. His eyes darted back and forth. “It’s simply an exercise to help with overcoming your past”. The skin and face seemed so real. Sticky coagulated blood like fluids around the edges and dripping slowly. And the face, good God that horrified expression. 

   “Simple prosthetics and makeup but it does look quite gruesome huh”? He placed his hand over his mouth and his face turned a bright green while his blue hair slumped down. He came running behind me with his squeaky shoes. “What memories do you see when you look into his eyes”? I stared at the stretched out vacant eye sockets. “I .. I remember when he kicked me off the bus”. 
I could feel him step closer and could hear the monkey outside the door making short panicked cries. 
“Keep going”. He whispered from behind.
I clinched the bat harder. “I fell.. Split my eyebrow and chipped my tooth. Everyone laughed. They.. They walked over me to class. Some stepped on top of me”. A shattered glass echoed from outside, the chimps cries grew louder and the clown grew closer. “Remember that feeling. Feel it… and let it go”. My heart raced and my breathing grew more labored. As the tears welled up I raised the bat and delivered the first blow.

   The bat made contact with a wet meaty thud that released a few puffs of glitter. I raised the bat and struck again and again and again. Each wack accompanied by the shrill screams of the chimpanzee and flows of bright colorful strips of paper and candies stained with a syrupy black maroon. The ball eventually crashed to the floor with a grotesque plat and rattle with all the treats released from the wrappings sticky squeeze. It was quiet again. The Dr slowly made his way into my peripheral. I looked over to him wearing a happy faced theatre mask that he quickly flung off. He raised a red solo cup with a short string on the end to his mouth. “Mr Banana could you please bring us a glass for a quick drink”?

   The chimp entered the room holding a tray with a single glass. The Dr lifted the glass and filled it with the water from his lapel and handed it to me. “I know this was hard for you”. He lifted a handkerchief. “Here dry your tears”. I took the handkerchief and pulled revealing that it was one of many in a never ending chain from his sleeve. I wiped my eyes and dropped them. Mr Banana quickly picked up the chain and continued pulling the rest from his sleeve. “Such events can give us feelings that, if not expressed, will sit dormant and eat away at our very souls like a cancer. Rotting and warping our sense of self”. His face was a soft whiteish purple. “I think this was enough for today. I’d like you to think and reflect on this exercise later in your free time”. He picked up a red stained candy, slipped it into my chest pocket and gestured towards the slide exit. I said nothing, my breathing still shaky. I looked back before sliding down. The Dr smiling and waving while Mr Banana continued frantically pulling the handkerchiefs from his sleeve. 

   I pushed myself down the slide and forced my arms and legs out just before the exit to stop myself. I heavily reconsidered my decision but I couldn’t just continue on. I needed to climb back up to see. I don’t know what exactly but I knew I needed to see. I carefully climbed back up the steep playhouse slide to the curve leading back to the office. The room came slowly into view as my head rose above the slides crest. It was barren, cold and charred black like a used log pulled from a fire pit with an odd wet sheen. In the back on his knees was the Doctor. Still colorful and now covered in a deep red, tearing away at the large sheet of Jacob’s flesh like it was a Fruit Roll-Up. Driving his teeth into it like a stray dog given a steak. On the floor next to him was a large ragged doll made to look like a chimpanzee. It had split seems with what I assume was sand seeping out of the openings. Without thinking I let out an audible gasp and Dr Boingo’s head lurched in my direction.

   I let myself drop. My feet hit the ground first but I fell swiftly to my back. Looking up at the hole I could see a shadow moving hastily with a deep gurgling scream echoing down through the slide. I rolled myself to my hands and feet and pushed myself off towards the exit as fast as I could. The mirrored walls looked as if they were closing in on me and I could swear my warped reflections were fighting to break out. I reached the exit and heard my name burst out from blood drowned lungs. “THOMAAAAAAASS”! 
I threw open the door and sprinted for the van. “Robert! Fucking drive, Robert”!! Robert was clearly shocked but waisted no time, thank God! He flinched so hard he threw his pack of cigarettes and jumped behind the wheel. We tore out of there before he shouted back at me. “The fuck was that, man, what are we running for”? I said nothing. I sat in the fetal position squeezing my knees to my chin as hard as I could. 

   Robert walked me back to my room with several nurses coming and going to try and understand what had happened. Robert didn’t know what to tell them so they chalked it up to an episode of complex ptsd or severe trauma disorder. The Doctors believed this fit and I agreed with them. I certainly couldn’t tell them what I saw. I’d be heavily medicated and sent to a padded room. Every time someone came to check on me I’d tell them the same thing over and over. “I just want to see my mom”. After two days avoiding everyone and too afraid to leave the safety of my bed a nurse had finally come in to tell me my mother was here to see me. I was escorted to a small visitation room where she was sitting and waiting. She jumped up, ran over and wrapped her arms around me. She reeked of alcohol but I didn’t care, I hugged her back tightly and began sobbing. “Hun what’s going on?? I was told you had a horrific trauma episode or something, what happened? It was that new Doctor wasn’t it, that quack. Can’t go messin round with people’s heads especially when they’re so fragile”!

   We spoke for a good while. I tried my best to stay off topic so we spent most of the time just catching up, making jokes and old memories. She was laughing when she stopped to answer her phone. “Hey! Yes, yes he’s fine I’m with him now. Uh huh. Ok. Yes they should let you on in”. She hung up and I asked “Who was that, mom”?
“It’s your father, dear. He’s worried sick. Wanted to see you! Bout damn time too am I right”? The door behind me opened up and a nurse welcomed in what was clearly Dr Boingo wearing my father’s freshly peeled face over his own. I launched myself out of my chair flush against the wall in horror. He stretched out his shiny bow tie and it snapped back with a rubbery pop. “Wah-ho-hoooo hey there, champ”! My mom stood up and gave him a hug. “Bout time you came to see your son, Steven. It’s only been like six years now since you last spoke”. He laughed “Well you know me, always fashionably late”. He pulled a large top hat out of his pocket and placed it on his head, tipped it and stuffed it back into his pocket. 

   Him and mom sat down facing me. My father’s face occasionally slipping down forcing him to have to constantly adjust it back into place. “Mom you need to get away from him now that’s-“ he threw his hand up in objection. “That’s enough, young man. You’ve put your poor mother through too much. We’ve discussed it and both agree that you will be going back to Dr Boingo McBoingerton to continue getting the help you so desperately need”. My mother nodded and I snapped back. “Mom are you blind?! That’s not dad it’s literally a clown wearing his damn face”! Dr Boingo’s eyes darted back and forth several times before he cleared his throat and stood up with the sound of slide whistle. “Come on now, Tommy. Let’s go”.  He looked like he was about to come for me so I made the first move.

   I ran to mom and grabbed her arm to pull her out of the room. “MOM RUN”! As I grabbed her arm I felt it give way beneath my fingers. Her arm was a rough fabric that ripped and began pouring sand over my hand and down to the floor. Her head slumped back and fell to the ground with a hard thud. The air left my lungs and I shook feeling that my legs could give out at any moment. *HONK HONK* “Whatever you said left her in stitches”. I closed my fist in the sand and threw it into his face. He threw his hands over his eyes and a centipede like tongue erupted from behind my father’s mouth. He snarled in frustration and I bolted for the door. I opened it to reveal the hall of mirrors. “Your session isn’t over yet. We have much to do”. I looked over my shoulder to see him slurping up my father’s face. “Hurting yourself won’t end the pain, son. It only transfers it to those closest to you”. I closed the door and took my chances with the hall.

   I ripped down a mirror and propped it against the entrance to barricade it. My fat headed reflection moaned at me in sorrow as I ran for the red door. I entered immediately wishing I had stayed with my reflections. There were stills chairs and everything else you’d expect but the once clean and harshly yellow room was now engulfed in what looked like.. innards. I’m quite certain I’m standing on organs and the walls look like stretched out bone, tendons and muscle. The room is lit with an ominous red glow and a feint heartbeat can be heard. A low grunt filled the room and rattled my core. I looked up to the ceiling to see the hideous visage of a chimpanzee. The wet face was inside out and though I was seeing the back of its eyes I could tell it was aware of me. Its teeth chattered excitedly dripping with saliva. At first glance there appeared to be no other door in sight. I walked around in a panic searching for an exit with no success. The mouth above oohed with a demonic hum and began to stretch wide. An arm began to reach down into the room. It was slow and felt around the room clumsily. Its putrid flakey flesh introduced a foul smell to this nightmarish stomach. 

   It felt me stepping back and began reaching in my direction. I yelled out like an infant, horrified at what would happen should it grab hold of me. It was slow thankfully but the room was small enough to where it didn’t matter. It was always far too close. I threw chairs and files, anything to delay or confuse the arm and that’s when I noticed them. The organs lining the floor had discolored blotches like bruising. Large ones that appeared to grow smaller and more frequent towards the opposite end of the room. The arm, confused by the chairs, was slowly feeling around the wall and floor to my right. I took a deep breath and sprinted for where the smaller botches converged picking up anything I could toss to buy me time. The arm followed, thrown off by the random objects but closing in. Where the dots led appeared to just be thick meat lining the wall. In my desperation I began clawing and ripping flesh away. The arm spasms and the mouth gaped open bellowing out in a low haunting screech. I clawed and clawed until my fingertips pounded against something solid. A doorknob! 

   I ripped and peeled away muscle from the lining of the door. I pulled the knob until the gap in the doorway began to open. The gnarled knuckles of the chimps arm dragged across the wet floor on its way to me. I opened the door wide enough to cram my shoulder into it and pushed my chest against it with all my might trying to force the rest of me through. The arm lifted and sagged with loose skin and spit reaching out and closing in on me. It felt like the doorway was ripping the top layer of my chest off and just as the apes finger made contact with my arm I fell through into the next room. 

   The door slammed shut and I laid still in the absolute quiet of Dr Boingo’s office. Looking around the room from my back it was the same charred and desolate room I had seen before. I turned my head and the Doctor was sitting patiently in his chair, one leg over the other. He smiled that big calm red smile and gestured at the seat across from him. Barely able to move at this point I accepted the situation, climbed up to my feet and limped over to take my seat. He scribbled in his notepad, hair swaying up and down. He dropped the pad down to the table and after a quick glance I could see that this whole time he had just been doodling balloons. He leaned back and spoke “Now Timmy it wo-“. 
“It’s Thomas”. I interrupted. He looked surprised and with a smile he leaned in. “You have shown tremendous growth, Thomas. And in such a short amount of time too”! He lifted a small trumpet horn and honked it twice. 

  Several colorful sandbag arms ripped out from the chair’s cushions and restrained me. I squirmed and fought but it was meaningless. I wasn’t going anywhere. The Doctor stood up and began unbuttoning his suit. “For this next exercise, Thomas, we’ll be needed to look beneath the surface. Peel back the layers so to speak. We’ll be opening up and taking a good look inside that head of yours”. With the last button undone his coat spread open wide like a bats wings. Countless teeth and thick red fibers writhed in all directions. He moved the table away now standing in front of me. His face was a blackened maroon and his toothy wings slowly closed in around me. He raised a finger that stretched into sharp point and aimed it at my forehead. I felt it begin to slowly pierce my head and just as I screamed out I felt and heard a deafening pop.

   I shot up screaming and hyperventilating. Women in scrubs darted in speaking but I couldn’t hear a word. I looked down at tubes in my arm that they kept me from ripping out. I fought frantically until someone ran in to inject something into my IV and I slipped away into nothing. I woke up again only this time in a much slower and calmer state. Looking around it was clear now that I was in a hospital room. The sound of the heartbeat monitor keeping me anchored to this new setting. A nurse drew back the curtain and revealed my tear stained mother gasping with joy to see me. She ran over and wrapped her arms around me tightly. It hurt but it was a good pain. She smelled like lavender. We cried together and when she began telling me how happy she was that I was alright after the stomach pump and I interrupted her. 
   
   I told her how sorry I was for making her worry. How wrong I was to allow the hate from others to make me hate who I was. I told her how much I loved her and thanked her for sticking with me through it all. She told me that she would of course always love and support me and that together we’d both grow and get the help we needed. She pulled me in for another hug with my head resting comfortably on her shoulder. There on the table next to my bed, amongst the flowers and get a well soon card I could see a raggedy chimpanzee doll. It had a long gentle smile and a split seam leaking sand.
