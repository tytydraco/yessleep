 This story is pretty self explanatory, what isn’t is what happened. For some background; I’m a member of a government task force for studying the unknown, it doesn’t matter if it’s supernatural, or political. My particular specialty in my team is demolition. I carry breaching charges, grenades and my favorite; thermite. I’m getting off topic, what happened before we were called in has been confirmed by multiple sources at accident Site 237 at the time of the incident.

2100; The day before, the hole formed no bigger than a penny. 2200; the hole had grown in size to about a basketball. 2210; the hole had grown even bigger, about the size of a car’s tire. 0500; the hole had grown to a large size, slightly larger than a car. 0645; a small crowd forms. 0700; a victim of accident Site 237 orders someone to recover his car. 0705; victim’s car falls into Site 237’s anomaly. 0710; Canadian government contacts US government officials. 0800; all victims detained and handed over to the US government. 0805; We’re called in to help with containing the spread of the anomaly.

The government would have my head on a stick if they found out that I released that information. They’ve already detained someone who documented this on this very same platform. It’ll be difficult to find it because any and all information of it ever existing has been deleted. After we made it to Site 237, we were given the rundown of what we needed to do. A scouting team was already sent down to check the conditions. The ground is composed of a very hard rock-like material. There are very small sulfur deposits in between the rocks. The air was mainly oxygen near the entrance but further in, it became more methane and hydrogen, both very flammable gasses. The landscape is uneven and very mountainous.

There were large creatures that roamed in the distance, there were smaller ones as well, and they seemed to be drawn to the scouts but didn’t seem hostile. After that we were sent in. Our main objective was to protect a group of scientists as they gather as much information about this place. As we walked further into Site 237 we got a report from command that the hole is growing at a faster speed than anticipated so we need to pick up the pace and get in and out. I then made a comment under my breath about how they’re supposed to have people working up there.

I had a thought, if push comes to shove, I could light a flare and blow this whole place up. The only problem would be that it would destroy everything including us. I told the team and they agreed that we should use that, only as a last resort though, after all other options have been exhausted. As we moved we came across a huge 17th century castle that was surrounded in flames, the only thing that wasn’t was the door. It was this huge ornate double door that was made from the same stone that made up the ground. We needed to figure out how to get that hole closed up soon because if the oxygen from the surface made it to the castle the entire cavern would explode, though I’ve got a feeling that this fire was supernatural and has some magical power to not cause its own destruction but you never know. We pushed on the door and surprisingly it opened with great ease. As we made our way in I saw statues of angels, all except one were intact but the last one was decimated, leaving only a few rocks at the base. On the base was the name Lucifer.

As we continued through this great hall we came across a throne. It was massive in size, it looked like it could hold the Empire State Building on the arm rest, like a cup on a recliner. This room was a dead end so we turned around to see what I can only assume to be Lucifer, he looked nothing like how anything portrays him, I couldn’t even begin to describe him. He scared the piss out of everyone including myself and we’ve seen some crazy shit. I think we all collectively came to terms with death, I know I did. I dropped my gun and fell to my knees, stunned at what I was seeing. As I sat there on the ground staring at what was my soon to be death, I came to the realization; my flare.

I could set out to use the contingency plan but part of the plan was to get approval from all living members of the team. As I looked at them I saw that they were all in the same catatonic state that I was in. I opened my mouth to ask but nothing came out, I turned to the creature and what I saw will be stuck in my head until I die. That thing had its finger to its mouth as if to silence a room full of children. I went to stand and run but when I did the world was shrouded in darkness. I could still see myself but everything around me was pitch black, including the floor.

“Silence mine issue, doth not fear for thy life, I don't wanteth to taketh it.” a deep voice spoke

“Who the hell are you, what do you want from me?” I shouted to the sky.

“All I wanteth from thee is for thee to entertain me.” the voice spoke back. I couldn't see it but I knew it had a smile on its face.

“How so?” I once more shouted to the sky.

“However thou wanteth.” it said

“I’ll do it if you take me back to that castle.” I shouted, I had an idea. With that I was sent back to the room that I was standing in before. I stood in front of the throne that was previously empty. Now the beast sat in it.

“Now then, thou has't gained what thou wanted, now it is mine turn.” the beast spoke in the same voice from before. I reached behind my back and grabbed hold of the flare and undid the cap. After doing this I crouched down and in one fell movement I swiped the flare across the ground, lighting the flare. As I held it above my head waiting for the explosion I heard the beast speak

“Is this part of the act?” it asked. I stood there stunned, I looked at the flare and noted that it was lit.

“I don't understand, why didn't the place explode? The air is mainly hydrogen and methane.” I asked, still staring at the flare.

“Oh, I  see, thou wast trying to ignite the gasses, that is hysterical” and with that the beast erupts into laughter, loud, booming laughter. I think I'm being mocked but I don’t care, I'm alive and I've done what it wanted so that has to be worth something.

“Where are my friends?” I asked the beast as it calmed down.

“That hath to beest one of the funniest things someone hath done to entertain me.” It said completely ignoring my question.

“Hey buddy, I asked you a question.” I shouted at it.

“Oh, mine dear friend, thy team is gone, and as far as anyone else is concerned, so art thee.” it said leaning down in its throne losing all sign that it had been laughing.

“Who are you, why are you doing this?” I asked, fearing the answer.

“Oh, Me? I am the most wondrous Lucifer, the Caesar of hell, and the tormentor of the damned.” It boomed. “But doth not fret, I doth not concern mineself with the concerns of others, I  suggest that thee moveth for that exit now, those gents has't  figured out how to close  it, and as far as those gents knoweth, thou don't exist.” it said pointing to the door that has now become the front door. Not just that but the door is open and leads straight to the hole. 

“Why are you telling me this, you’re Satin” I asked looking up at it.

With a smile on his face it leaned in close and whispered “Entertainment, and for valorous measure, here's some encouragement” with that two small demons appeared in front of him, they looked ravenous. With that I started running, and as I ran I heard that damned laugh. I ran and as I did the ground around me changed, becoming smooth or sometimes rough, pillars would shoot out of the ground, sections would collapse in front of me. I feared for my life, for my soul if anything.

Eventually I came to the exit and shouted for someone. I turned to the direction I just came from to see those things still chasing after me. I shouted even louder, and with that a rope was thrown down. Before it had even hit the ground I grabbed on and started climbing but as I was climbing those things started crawling up the wall to the surface. For the first time since I joined the government I let out a genuine shout of pure terror. I looked at them just in time to see them get shot, and with that I climbed the rest of the way out and was met with multiple guns pointed in my face.

I was asked questions, and with all of them it left them more confused. I tried to tell them what happened, all the way down to the whole “Lucifer” part. I eventually got them to believe me but just after that, I passed out and woke up at the top of the hole, right back where I started. I tried to explain it to them again, but the same thing happened. I tried again and again and again but no matter what I said or how long it took to get them to believe me, as soon as they did it would restart. I gave up, I stuck to “yes”, “no”, and “I don’t know”. It worked, I got out of the cycle but now they have given me an opportunity, I join the program or they give me amnestics and I go on my merry way.

The reason this is even a choice is because, I've seen what the program has to offer so I know what to expect but on the other hand; I have no friends any more, and they said since I'm not on any record they would give me a name, a place to live and an decent job. They gave me 30 days to come up with an answer. Right now I’m sitting in a low end apartment in Canada with a cellphone and a phone number. I’ve got enough food to last me a month.

They left me a note, it reads as follows; “You have 30 days to respond to our proposition. For now you will be locked in here with the internet, a laptop, a television, and a phone with one contact, us. If you escape we will know and the outcome will not be in your best interests. You have plenty of time, use it wisely.”
