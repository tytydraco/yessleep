They say grief blinds people, and I believe it. At funerals, everyone’s drowning in sorrow, too distracted to notice the little things: rings on stiff fingers, watches still ticking on dead wrists, necklaces tucked into coffins. That’s where I come in. Some men make a living with a hammer or a pen. Mine’s with a shovel.

When the new cemetery opened on the edge of town, I was curious. Fresh graves. Families eager to bury their loved ones with expensive heirlooms. I watched the place for days—counted the guards, tracked the caretaker’s routine, timed when the lights went out. The place was neat, almost too neat, like it had no history.

Except for the chapel.

It sat crooked in the far corner, wood blackened with age. No paint, no lights, just a damp swollen door. It looked less built than grown. Nobody ever went near it.

I picked a night when the clouds covered the moon and headed for a fresh grave. A wealthy man had been buried that morning—rings, gold watch, the kind of haul I live for. I had the spot memorized.

But the soil was already disturbed.

The coffin sat half-pulled from the earth. Three figures stood around it, dark shapes in the mist. They didn’t move like thieves. They didn’t rush. They lifted the lid and drew the body out slowly, almost carefully.

The corpse sagged in their arms, mouth slack, skin already darkening. One of the men brushed dirt from its suit like he was handling something precious.

I crouched low, heart hammering. They carried the body across the cemetery, straight to the chapel. The door groaned open, and for a second I swore the building itself sighed.

Inside, the air hit me—wet, sour, like the inside of a rotten animal. They laid the corpse on the altar. I expected knives, maybe chanting, maybe stripping the jewelry. Instead, the stone split open with a grinding shriek.

Beneath wasn’t a crypt. It was a hollow without bottom, blacker than night. A wave of heat poured out, thick with a stench so foul it felt like my teeth were rotting just breathing it in. The air pulsed, guttural, like something below was trying to speak but didn’t know how.

The corpse slid into the dark. No splash. Just gone.

The stone sealed shut. The three figures bowed their heads and began to chant. Not words I could understand. Not even a language. Just rhythm. Slow, steady, like a heartbeat out of sync with mine. My chest clenched, and for a moment I thought my heart would stop trying to follow it. Then the chanting ended, just like that, and the silence was heavier than the sound.

I didn’t breathe until they left.

Most men would’ve run. But me? My hands shook, not from fear, but certainty. Behind that altar, hidden in cracks and walls, the treasures must still be there. The caretakers didn’t care about gold. They fed the bodies to whatever was down there, but the rings, the watches, the necklaces—they stayed.

When the chapel was empty, I stepped inside.

The altar radiated warmth, like something alive beat inside it. I reached out. Just before my hand touched, I felt it. Not words. Not thought. Just hunger. Blind, endless, reaching for me like a tongue in the dark.

I ripped my hand back. My stomach churned. The air outside was cold, but it didn’t matter. I could still feel the heat crawling under my skin.

And then I realized—I wasn’t empty-handed. In my fist, without remembering taking it, was the dead man’s gold watch, the one I’d come for. Its face ticked softly, steady as a heartbeat, though the glass was cracked and the gears ran backward.

I stumbled out of there, swearing I’d never return.  
But I know myself.

The bodies mean nothing. The hunger I can ignore. But I can't forget about the gold.

I know where the cemetery hides its riches.  
I already carry a piece of it with me.  
And I will return.
