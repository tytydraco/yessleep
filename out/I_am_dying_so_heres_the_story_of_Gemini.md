Hospice is quiet at night. The only sounds are the occasional beeps of machines, the soft scuff of nurses’ shoes in the hallway, and the whisper of my own breath—steady, but weaker than it used to be. I know I don’t have much time left. That’s why I’m writing this.

I want someone to know.

Since I was seven years old, I’ve seen a man who looks exactly like me.

The first time it happened, I was playing in the backyard. The summer air was thick and buzzing with cicadas, and I was running around, pretending I was an explorer in some lost world. Then I saw him.

He stood at the edge of the trees, half-hidden in the shade, watching me.

It was like looking into a mirror. Same sandy hair, same round face, same slightly crooked front tooth. But there was something… off. He didn’t smile. He didn’t wave. He just stood there, staring at me with dark, expressionless eyes.

I remember running inside, calling for my mom, but by the time she came out, he was gone.

That night, my father had a heart attack.

He survived, but just barely.

I didn’t think about the boy in the trees again—until the next time I saw him.

I was ten. Walking home from school, kicking a rock down the sidewalk. I looked up, and there he was, across the street, standing completely still between two parked cars. Same face. Same blank stare.

That night, my best friend’s house caught fire. His family got out, but they lost everything.

I started calling him Gemini. I don’t know why. The name just came to me. It felt right.

He appeared before every tragedy in my life.

When I was sixteen, I saw him outside my girlfriend’s house. The next day, she was in a car accident.

When I was twenty-four, he stood at the back of the church at my wedding. A week later, my wife miscarried our first child.

When I was thirty-two, he was sitting on a park bench outside the hospital where my mother was being treated for cancer. She died that night.

Before she passed, she told me something I had never known.

“You had a twin,” she whispered. Her voice was thin, barely more than a breath. “A brother. But he… he didn’t make it. Stillborn.”

I remember feeling cold all over. My tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.

I had never told her about him.

I don’t know what Gemini is. He doesn’t speak. He doesn’t move, except to disappear when I look away for too long. He’s not a hallucination—others have noticed him, though they never recognize him as me. They always ask, Who’s that guy?

I tried chasing him once, when I was in my forties. I saw him standing at the end of the subway platform and ran after him. He didn’t run, just stepped around a corner and vanished.

That night, my house was broken into. The burglar had a gun.

I lived. My wife didn’t.

Decades have passed since then. I stopped trying to understand. Stopped trying to catch him. But I’ve never stopped seeing him.

And now… I’m dying.

I know it. The doctors know it. My body is shutting down, little by little. I have no family left. Just me, this hospice bed, and the slow, ticking clock of my heart.

Which brings me to now.

As I type this, the room is dim, lit only by the glow of my laptop screen. The hallway outside is empty. I feel the weight of exhaustion pressing down on me, but I force myself to keep writing.

Because just a few minutes ago, I looked up from my screen.

Gemini is here.

He’s sitting at the foot of my bed, hands resting in his lap, watching me with those same dark, unreadable eyes.

For the first time in my life, he’s closer than ever.

For the first time in my life, I think he’s waiting.

I don’t know what happens next.
