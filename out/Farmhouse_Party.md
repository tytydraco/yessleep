I(Abe 25) was out partying with my friends on a weekend at 4pm at one of my friends farmhouses. The evening was beautiful with the farm landscape making everything look orange. There was Sai(life of the party), Teach(his best buddy and a mutual friend), Trish(angel when sober, baby while drunk) and last but not least Zen(My GF). We all were highschool friends. It was a desolate farm, far from any community. I walked out of the farmhouse to see my friends near the hay, they were pouring drinks to one another from the table which they set on the dry farm ground. 

I joined them and had a good time with my buddies as we met after a really long time and it was more of a reunion. While dancing something nicked my leg near the ankle. I brushed it off thinking it might be some stone and didn't even bother looking at it. After sometime we experienced a very low scale earthquake, everyone was confused as the location didn't have any prior earthquakes. 

Trish after having a little bit more than she usually has had fallen into the neatly stacked hay and was fast asleep. As we were about to approach her and help her get inside to bed. Zen shrieked and dug up a weird looking statue the size of a banana(12 inches). It was an ominous looking statue, far from what children would play, it was holding a small scale Schmitar in its hand and was in the position of any cross legged deity. She pointed at the blood which was negligible as it was too little but that blood started to boil on its own and we thought it might be due to current extreme heat waves. 

Blood evaporated completely in seconds and there was a new shine to the idol as though someone had cleaned it thoroughly.

My leg started to feel warm, I checked both my legs and found, there's a small cut on my right leg. There was no blood at all near the cut as though someone had removed the blood to expose the tiny wound.

While all of this was going on we had our backs to Trish, only Zen was facing Trish as she was opposite to us. Zen stopped talking and saw something behind us which we failed to notice. Trish has vanished into the hay. Everyone except Zen was rummaging through the hay to pull out Trish thinking she might've covered herself with hay. Zen screamed to get away from that hay. We were obviously drunk and asked her to stop messing with us as Trish might be in danger. At the corner of my eye, I saw a small circular shadow the size of a medium pizza moving on the ground as though it's a RC car. 

The shadow closed in on Sai and swallowed him whole in an instant. There was no sound of anything happening, the orange sky turned red as soon as we saw what transpired. A sudden dredd fell on me, it was that situation where I know if I make any mistake in the next minute I won't survive at all. I saw Zen bolting for the door. I left rummaging and started running behind Zen to the house saftey. It was no more than twenty metres or 25 Walmart bananas. But it felt like I was running into the horizon but was unable to even cover 3 steps. Zen made it to the entrance and started shouting run Abe, I heard a noise which swallowed Teach too when Zen and I made a run to the house. That noise was of a pelvis bone being crushed under heavy pressure, I don't know why but I just know that sound is of that only. Zen saw me nearing the entrance but she saw something behind me and ran inside and locked the door shut. Even I am selfish so I thought, I too might've done the same. She must've seen something which triggered her flight or fight senses. So I didn't call out to her and made it to the entrance facing the door.

I sat down infront of the sturdy door, a chill ran through from my tail bone to the neck. I knew it, I'm done. I should atleast see what this monstrosity looks like outside the shadow. I should turn now to che
