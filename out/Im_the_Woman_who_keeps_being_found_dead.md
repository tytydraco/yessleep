Hello, everyone. I'm Audery Roan, 42 years old. For the past few years, once a month, bodies identical to mine have been found mutilated in the area. And I don’t mean lookalikes or people altered to resemble me—these are clones. I know that this sounds impossible, but in reality, the technology has been possible for at least 9 years. People clone all sorts of animals, usually dogs. They take a sample make an artificial sperm, and then inject it into an egg, and then a normal pregnancy occurs. It is concerning that the bodies fluctuate with age. Sometimes they're the same age as me, sometimes their twenty, and on truly awful days. They have been Younger. And seeing as they pop up every month without fail, whatever is doing this has a dependable source.

It took a while for people to understand what was happening. At first, they assumed I was part of a set of twins. But now that the body count has reached 72, that theory is obviously absurd. Both of my parents have passed away, and I’m an only child.

In the beginning, the remains were barely recognizable—just garbage bags filled with what looked like meat, hidden deep in the woods. . At first, the killings were thought to be missing teens or other drifters. But eventually, one of the bodies had my head on it. and one of the officers recognized me because I sold his son a car at my job. And when they went to investigate my house, they were shocked to see me there. So then I gave them a swab and they checked it. Over time, whatever is doing this has grown bolder, dumping the bodies in public places I frequent

It's Crazy to actually wake up one morning and find out you're dead. I thought angels or the grim reaper would be involved.

Authorities have confirmed the bodies are human, but many are missing vital organs—usually the brain, lungs, but sometimes limbs are absent as well. It’s also believed that not all of them were killed… assuming they were ever truly alive to begin with.

On Christmas of 2021. I woke up hungover from the party I held at my house the night before. Came down, went to the kitchen to get my morning coffee. My kitchen is directly to the right of my living room, and my living room has these glass doors that go out to my deck out back and there was a giant "comical " present. right outside. At first i thought it was a just a simple joke from my friends. Because every year I make a big stink about not wanting anything because i personally like to provide for others and hate being a burden. And SO they got me something while I was asleep as a sorta "haha enjoy it you grinch."

But instead I opened the box and inside was >!the body wearing Santa-themed lingerie and written on it's stomach in my shade of lipstick. "Merry Christmas Thanks for the fuck" That was the first time I found a body. !<So now I spend every holiday at the police Station. They're nice people but it's apparent my already shaky relationship with festivities and being the center of attention has gotten worse. I don't wear makeup anymore either.

The police are investigating but progress in the case has stagnated. Besides the fact that bodies keep popping up. We do fear that eventually one of the bodies will actually be me so I have been forced to undergo daily surveillance and wellness checks. Along with constant harassment from news outlets trying to get a fresh scoop but instead of letting a bunch of shameless ghouls profit off of me I'm just going to inform the people directly. Feel free to ask me anything.
