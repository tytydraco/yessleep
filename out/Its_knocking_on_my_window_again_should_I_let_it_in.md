I started hearing the knocks on the third week, after becoming comfortable enough in the office to take space in the break room. Following a lunchtime spent chatting with my new coworkers, I sat at the table finishing off my cup of coffee. I heard a few taps on one of the windows behind me. Although I found nothing when I turned to look. I wrote it off as nothing, finished my coffee and got back to work.

The next time I heard it, I found nothing again. It sounded like a piece of wood lightly tapping on some glass so it was easy to write it off as some kink in the construction of the building. Although I wanted to ask around the office about the sound, I didn’t want to come off as strange to my new coworkers. Especially since I had landed a job in the field I wished to pursue.

Three months later, I returned from a holiday. The first Monday back is always hard, especially when you have a hangover. I sat at my desk with my head in my arms. Bobby walked in, three minutes late as usual, and sat in his seat beside me.

“Still feeling like shit?” he asked.

“Still feeling?”

“From last Friday.”

I shook my head, confused.

“Oh come on,” he said. “Peppermint? You went wild. A little too wild for a work thing.”

“I don’t know.”

He furrowed his brow, “That bad?”

“I wasn’t even in last week.”

Bobby laughed, “Don’t fuck with me.”

“I’m not fucking with you!”

“Okay, you weren’t in. Jeez.”

The next day, I sat in the break room nursing my persisting headache. The knocks returned. The consistency of them resounded through my mind. I did my best to ignore them still. A difficult task considering my state.

I returned home that night to my girlfriend having disappeared with all her belongings, leaving only a note on the table to explain her decision to breakup and move out. I tried to sleep in our bed, but the memory of her burned too bright. Her scent in the pillows too strong. I resorted to buying some liquor from the store down the road and let myself into the office. At least only vague memories of banality lingered in the air.

The meeting room felt cold; the drink sorted that out in no time. I sat there, for a while, trying to cry it out a little, yet nothing came. Then the knocking started. Three consecutive knocks. I ignored it again. However, the knocks started getting louder and heavier, taking on the quality of a human fist rapping on the window. I turned to look and found nothing. I ignored it. It continued. Louder. Heavier.

I stood.

The window overlooking the city appeared empty. Nothing behind it nor in front of it. Although my sight was impaired by the light inside reflecting the room back to me, leaving little to look through. I approached with caution. As I stood a few feet away from the glass I could see the glimmer of something off to the side. My eyes struggled to focus for a moment before they adjusted to patches of reflected light.

I saw it move to stand in front of me, on the other side. A face—my face—reflecting back a wide, unsettling grin. Somehow the figure comfortably stood on the outside of the third storey. Somehow, it had my visage.

I turned, grabbed my keys and made for the exit. I was out of there within a minute. I followed a couple of drunks into the city center, happy to be around people. I looked around—behind me, in front of me, above me—uncertain of when this figure might strike. After a while, I managed to make it back to the apartment. Locking the door behind me and watching the door from my sofa, it didn’t take long for the adrenaline to wear off and for me to crash.

I awoke the next morning. No one had entered the apartment. I got dressed and called an Uber to get me to work. Wandering the streets seemed an unwise decision. As soon as I entered the office, a manager pulled me into a meeting room and demanded to know what I had been up to the previous night. I told him that I came to the office to calm down after a personal problem and then left. He pointed to the bottle I left behind and told me it was unprofessional at best, however a worse crime had been committed. A few monitors had been stolen.

I confessed to the drinking but pleaded innocence on the final charge. He relented, told me he knew, how the security cameras had captured me fleeing the office empty handed. They wanted to know if I saw anything strange.

I denied everything.

It took a while to go over all the details until I was fully exonerated. They had nothing that could link me to the theft. Aside from the thing outside the window, I knew nothing. Although I doubt the creature had such simple designs.

That night, when I returned to my apartment, I found a large box sitting outside my door. I took it in. Inside the box were three old dusty monitors. I packed them back up into the box and taped it up. With great heft, I managed to take the box across town, on foot, and threw it into the docks. The box sank into the water.

I sat on a bench, sweating hard, catching my breath. Relief washed over me. I told myself that suspicion had been averted from me. I told myself that any evidence linking me to the crime had sunk to the bottom of the sea. And yet, my anxiety still piqued. I remembered the creature that I had seen. That it knew where I lived and that it could be hiding in any of the shadows surrounding me. Disturbed by that thought, I ran to the center of town again and found reprieve among my fellow man.

I spent the next few weeks in my apartment. Work never called to ask where I have been. Bobby kept tagging me on Instagram. I checked one of the posts and found myself standing next to a group of other colleagues at a bar. A photo I never remembered appearing in. I got messages from people I know talking about the great nights I didn’t have or thanking me for birthday gifts I never gave.

A couple of days ago, the knocking started. Sometimes at my window. Other times at my door. Three knocks. Getting louder and louder, heavier and heavier with each rap. I think it wants to come in. Should I let it?
