I remember the moment I woke up, as if I had crossed the boundary between reality and something entirely alien.

The world around me was orange and red, dusty, the dry sand stretching endlessly in every direction. Rocks and canyons glowed in shades of orange and copper, as if the landscape itself had been forged from fire. The sun cast harsh shadows, making the stone shapes look like sculptures but there was something I noticed immediately: the mountains and cliffs were not entirely natural. They seemed… constructed. Square, angular forms rose from the terrain, perfectly camouflaged.

From a distance, no one would have recognized them as buildings. You would have thought you were looking at a natural rock formation. But the closer you got, the clearer the alien architecture became, a perfect illusion that blended seamlessly into the landscape.

The air was dry, gritty against my skin, smelling of dust, scorched stone, and a metallic undertone that made my throat tighten. In the distance, a deep, rumbling sound vibrated through the air, like the heartbeat of the Earth itself, slow and relentless.

Suddenly, I found myself inside one of these “rocks.” The interior was gigantic, towering so high that the light from the panels barely reached the ceiling. It smelled of cold metal and sterile plastic, and the air was cool, almost artificial.

Dozens of teenagers stood there, clad in tight, matte suits. Some held long rods or devices whose purpose I could not comprehend. Their movements were tense, every gesture seemingly monitored, every posture controlled. Steps echoed through the room like distant thunder, voices murmured quietly, never loud enough to understand.

And then I felt something change within me. My body reacted differently. I moved faster. My muscles trembled, charged like live wires. The world around me sharpened, colors more intense, contrasts brighter, details crystal clear. A faint shimmer flickered around my body, as if invisible energy were radiating from me.

Instinctively, I knew I had to escape. I ran, my legs carrying me faster than I thought possible. I climbed, jumped, slid. Everything happened in a breathless blur of motion. Behind me, a sharp voice yelled, “STOP! Don’t do this we’ll get in trouble!” But I barely heard it. I couldn’t stop.

Then I was outside. I plunged into the abyss. The red rocks, which looked like natural mountains, rushed past beneath me. But my fall slowed unnaturally, as if gravity itself had softened. Wind whipped through my hair, my clothing flared wildly. When I hit the ground, the impact was soft, surprisingly gentle, as if the air had caught me. My heart pounded in my chest, loud, overwhelming everything else.

But the calm didn’t last. The rocks or were they buildings began to glow. Red lights flickered across their walls, black and red pulses rippling through the landscape. Sirens blared, shrill and metallic, cutting through me to the bone.

Then I heard them: drones. Massive, dark, box-shaped, like predators in the sky. Their searchlights swept across the terrain, casting long, harsh shadows. Some hovered directly above me, so close that I felt the hum of their engines in my chest. Everything vibrated, buzzed, and clicked like a mechanical heart hunting for me.

I pressed myself against the rough red stone, drew my knees up, and melted into the shadows. My breathing was fast and heavy, my heartbeat like hammer blows. Above me, the drones circled, their red eyes scanning the ground, and every moment could have been my last.

And then everything blurred. The lights left long trails, the sirens and motors muffled, everything dissolving into a distant echo.
