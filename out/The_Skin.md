They call it “Derma Farm”. 
About forty minutes outside Urbandale, Iowa. 


There’s all sorts of stories around town and online. As to what it was, or what actually happened here. Everything from the stereotypical farmer and wife murder suicide to ghosts. Though there was one that stuck like mold. 

“The skin”


There were five of us that weekend me, Jonah, Amber, Troy, and Lex.
We all work a wide range of normal jobs. 
Accountant, Welder, Photographer, etc. 
Though there was one thing that bonded us together like nothing else. 

Urban exploring. 

You know, going into abandoned buildings. Exploring what history was left and trying to figure out what went wrong. Some love to play video games, we loved to play detective in 19th century buildings. 


Troy texted us all on a Friday night. 
It was a location, one that instantly sent a sharp shiver down my spine. 

The text read 
“Derma Farm”


The farmhouse looked like it was held together by rot and luck. Even that was being generous. 

Two stories, half collapsed roof, a porch drowning in weeds.

The fields behind it were wide and dry, dotted with scarecrows that didn’t move in the wind. 


We joked about them as we parked, but the longer I looked, the less I wanted to.
They weren’t made right.

Their shapes were off. Arms too long, knees bent backward, heads tilted like they’d been hung there mid scream. And the texture, something I’d never seen on a scarecrow before. Almost as though, leather. 

Still, we went in.

The air was thick and sweet, like darkened spoiled fruit.
Dust swallowed the flashlight beams, and every board groaned like it had a pulse. 

There were jars everywhere on counters, shelves, the floor.
Each one held something pale inside fingers, ears, pieces of things that might’ve been dolls if you wanted to sleep at night.

Jonah dismissed it immediately, he laughed when he saw our terrified faces.  
“They’re props idiots” “kids come in here all the time making stupid little horror videos”. 

Amber and I looked at each other with a glare that shared a mutual message. “This isn’t right”. 

It didn’t matter that it had been abandoned for decades, and kids with cameras or not. This felt off. Far too off. 
We’d never seen anything like this before. 

But amber and I were far too easily influenced, you could probably peer pressure us into eating a can of worms if you really tried hard enough. 

We split up Lex upstairs, Troy to the kitchen, Amber to the back porch, and Jonah and I toward what looked like a cellar door half buried under tools.

The lock was new.
That should’ve been the first giant red flag. Hell it was though we were staring directly at an elephant in a room. 

Jonah grabbed his crowbar and pried it open anyway. The metal screeched.

The air that came out was colder than the rest of the house and it smelled wrong. A sickening rotting I can’t describe in words in any dictionary. 

We went down only three steps before the flashlight hit the wall.
It wasn’t stone or wood.
It was that leather.
Stitched in patches.

Jonah whispered, “That’s not like any animal hide, Id ever seen”. 
I told him to turn off the light.

We heard breathing below us. Slow, heavy, deliberate.
Then the steps creaked like someone was coming up.

We ran.

We didn’t stop until we were back in the living room shouting for the others.
Lex came down from upstairs, pale.
He said the rooms were full of mannequins nailed to the walls.

He didn’t realize until he was close that they had teeth. Not ceramic, they appeared real. 

Then we couldn’t find Amber.
Her flashlight lay on the porch, still on, pointing toward the field.

Troy said he saw movement near one of the scarecrows.
We all turned our lights that way.
For a second, I thought one of them waved.

Then something moved behind us.

It was him. 

He was tall, wearing a darkly soaked apron.
The skin on his hands was so tight it shone.
His face was wrong stitched where it shouldn’t be, lips pulled thin like he’d sewn on a smile that didn’t belong to him.

He swung something it caught Lex across the face, dropped him instantly.
Jonah shoved me toward the stairs, yelling for me to run.

I made it two steps before everything went black.

When I came to, I was in a small concrete room lit by a single bulb.
My wrists were strapped to a gurney.
Something wet dripped nearby.

There were shapes hanging from hook human, but emptied out. 

Skins like hollow suits, drying.


A radio crackled somewhere above me, a voice humming softly over static. Music sounding as though from the 40’s. 
Footsteps echoed slow, measured.

Then I saw him.

He spoke gently, like a teacher:
“You can’t preserve beauty unless you understand anatomy.  
Do you understand anatomy, son?”


I didn’t answer. 
He horrifically smiled anyway.

The knife came down.

I don’t know how long I was under.
When I woke again, I was outside.
My hands were free. 

Everything was pounding, throbbing. 
I had tunnel vision, my head was spinning so hard I thought it would fall off my shoulders. 
I felt the most physically ill I had ever felt in my life, like no flu I had ever experienced. 

The sky was grey, sun just cresting the horizon.

I staggered toward the field. Only then did I notice the sickening scent of iron. 
I looked down and noticed the puncture wounds oozing dark blood, all over. 

I fell to my knees in sudden agonizing pain. I looked up confused, hurt and sick. 

That’s when I saw them.

Five new scarecrows stood in a perfect row.

Amber’s hair swayed faintly in the wind.
Jonah’s jacket. 
Troy’s boots. 
Lex’s head, tilted too far to one side. 

Their skin was pale and glossy, stitched with black thread.

Their eyes were open.
It almost appeared as though they were breathing with the wind. 

When I truly understood what I was witnessing, I gagged so hard I thought I’d vomit my lungs out. 
I wanted to scream, I tried to. 

I tried to scream as hard as I knew possible. 

Though nothing would come out. 
My throat ached, raw and tender. 

Behind me, I heard the creak of the farmhouse door.
Then the sound of it closing.

And somewhere below the floorboards,
a latch opening.

The basement door.

I looked behind-

Held my breath and closed my eyes.
