I found a camera under a park bench on my way home. The first photo it printed showed my mom lying on the kitchen floor. I checked the timestamp. Monday. I hadn’t been in the kitchen. I hadn’t touched anything. I stared at the print like it could explain itself. It didn’t.

The camera was cold and heavy in my hands. The lens caught the light like it was watching me. I set it on the counter, but my fingers kept twitching toward it. Summer photography class. TikTok clips. Montreal. Moving out. My chest tightened thinking about leaving home, and I didn’t know which was worse: the camera, or everything it was showing me.

Click. The first print slid out. Coffee had spilled across Mom’s notebook, ink bleeding into the paper. I double-checked. No one else had been in the apartment. Nothing explained this. I laughed, sharp and hollow, trying to convince myself it was a trick. But deep down I knew it wasn’t.

The next morning, sketchbook pages had curled, and a pen rolled across the floor. I hadn’t touched anything. The smell of paper and ink hit me like smoke. Just photos. Nothing more, I told myself.

By midweek, things escalated. A chair tipped over. My laptop cracked. A print from the camera showed the same scene from last week, but slightly off. My pulse was hammering.

I spun for TikTok. Click. Print: me crouched, face buried in my hands, crying. I hadn’t done it. But it smelled like me — shampoo, sweater, hallway.

I tried spilling juice on purpose. Print: my secret handwriting, something I had hidden for years. Fingers shaking, I shoved it under my pillow.

Text from my girlfriend: “Move-in tomorrow! Can’t wait!” Another print slid out: a confession I had never sent. My heart thumped so hard it hurt.

Thursday. Everything was subtly wrong. Chair slightly moved, pen on the wrong side, curtains crooked. Print on the counter: me staring at a letter I hadn’t written. My smile cracked. Someone was watching.

Night. Cross-legged on the floor, camera on my knees. Print: bedroom door ajar, shadow stretching. Hoodie figure, face hidden. Hands pressed against the wall. I hadn’t taken this photo yet.

Footsteps outside my room. Pulse jagged. Click. Print: apartment from the ceiling, spilled juice, cracked laptop, tipped chair. Mom looking straight at me — alive. Empty eyes. Monday said she was gone. Funeral photos, hospital visits. She shouldn’t be here.

Friday. One last experiment. Camera pointed at me texting my girlfriend. Print: me frozen, phone dropped, grin gone. Timestamp five minutes.

I backed toward the window. Print slid across the floor. Me, doorway, eyes wide, empty. Exactly where I was.

Creak. Apartment smelled of coffee, ink, metallic tang. Heart kicked against my ribs.

Whir-click. Click. Print: hallway stretched impossibly long. Shadows pooled, folding. Hoodie figure pressed against the wall, moving forward.

I dropped it, but the shutter didn’t stop. Knees hit the carpet.

Whir-click. Last print: Mom smiling in the doorway. Wrong. Too wide. Too patient. The room behind me empty. Chair toppled, notebook open, prints scattered. No me.

The camera whirred one last time. The print slid out, face down, waiting.
