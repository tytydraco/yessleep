One of my best friend's, Jenna, stays right next door to me. Last month she invited me and a couple other friends to a little get-together, and she also wanted to showcase her dog, which was a husky, a REALLY large husky, named "Mob". It was rivaling the size of a great dane, a breed which I've had many times in the past, it used to sit on Jenna's lap and she'd everywhere. Of course I had no problems, I touched it a few times when everyone else was petting it but otherwise I never individually made it up to myself to pet it. Which is pretty unusual because I love dogs, but I genuinely thought Mob would bite me.

3 weeks ago me and Jenna were just sitting down and having a couple of drinks at her place, while Mob came over next to me, Jenna really wanted me to pet her and even though I was hesitant I didn't want to seem like some sort of pussy, so I put my hand out first (it's usually good to let the dog's sniff around and know whether they can trust you or not), but it bit me, straight up, it bit my fingers, I pulled my hand out, and it bit my arm as well, Jenna pulled him away but the amount of pain I was in was immense. 

I went to the hospital that night, got everything bandaged up. Now obviously this is just normal dog behaviour, Jenna even apologized but I'm sure she didn't expect that either. But it's what happened a few nights after that made me worried, you could say. There's a little river, down past the road, behind a cluster of trees, well flowing and you can ever hear it from a distance. I was sitting on my porch one night when I very clearly saw Mob there, just right beside the river, the street lights were just barely lighting it up, but I could see glowing eyes, his large white/black body, etc. It was like 2am, chilly as hell outside, and I was going to call Jenna but I had that pure hatred for that dog, that I wanted it to not come back, I honestly wanted it to have escaped and just run away and get lost or something. 

Then I heard some weird gagging noises coming from him, I wanted to try getting his attention so I loudly stepped on my porches wooden floor. But then he jumped into the river, I saw him do it, and I was confused as to what I was seeing but it looked like I saw him galloping in the river, like jumping up and down the way a dolphin does. It sounds quite stupid when I say it but I don't see how else I can explain it. Then he goes out of sight behind the cluster of trees. I did feel a slight bit of unease so I went inside and went to bed. Next morning I wake up to a large group of police cars and officers on the road beside the trees and river. Jenna was also there. I asked Jenna what was happening on phone first, but when she didn't respond I just walked up and asked her, she said that someone called the police from here, sounding very distressed, so they sent 2 officers out but they never came back or responded, and their bodies were lying back there. 

One of the cops told us both to go back as we weren't needed here. Jenna also told me that Mob was missing since morning. I told her that I think I saw him near the river itself, but she got a little upset thinking that I was trying to suggest that the dog killed the officers. She also asked why the hell would I not wake her up, and I made an excuse and said "I thought I was just seeing things". 

That night I know what I saw, and nobody can change my mind otherwise. It was only 9 or so, where I could here, you know they sound for when something ducks underwater, like something huge, that type of suction noise which, I don't know how to explain it but it basically disrupted the river flowing ambience. I looked outside and to be just plane with it, there was a huge creature which was constantly gagging, like how kennel cough sounds, 3 gags, and a barf but nothing comes out. I couldn't make out if half of it was in the river or the full body was out because it was in a position where I didn't know if it was half or full. Then it fully submerged into the river, making that suction noise again. It's confusing I know. I didn't want to tell Jenna and sound stupid (I do like her), so I told one of my other friends, who really wanted to explore that river place after hearing about the dead cops but wanted me to go along, but I said no. 

I told him what I saw after he came over to my place, I told him NOT to tell Jenna, and he gave me information on "Bunyip". He told me to search it up, and I do know what it is, just wasn't sure when he said it. You can look into it yourself, but it's basically a well known folklore tale that is talked around her about a big beast that roams around waterbeds. It's known to take many forms, my mother used to scare me with stories of Bunyip when I was young, if I didn't eat my food, then blah blah blah, you know. Obviously not that I'm saying whatever I saw IS "Bunyip", I do however think that it was the dog, Mob, it doesn't make sense but it was too pure a coincidence I saw him at the river before the cops were found. 

That's all that has happened so far, it's not the most intresting story but it certainly questioned me, will update if anything happens.
