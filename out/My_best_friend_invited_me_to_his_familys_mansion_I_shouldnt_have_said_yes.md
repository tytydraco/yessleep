I wasn’t planning to go anywhere for the holidays. Not after my mom passed.

I told everyone I wanted to be alone. Truth is, I didn’t want to feel anything.

Then Adam called.

He didn’t ask how I was doing. He just said, *“Come stay with us for the break. You shouldn’t be alone right now.”*

I almost said no. Almost.

But Adam had been there for me when nobody else was. Even at the funeral, he was the only one who didn’t look at me like I was something fragile about to break.

So I said yes.

That was my first mistake.

The drive up to his family’s mansion felt like it took forever. Winding roads. Forest stretching in every direction. No houses. No signs. Just miles of silence, broken only by the gravel crunching under the tires.

And then I saw it.

A **stone tower**, rising through the trees.

It wasn’t on a hill. It was just… *there*, like it had always been part of the forest, like the trees had grown around it rather than the other way around.

It felt like it was watching us.

I asked Adam what it was.

He just kept driving.

The mansion appeared like a mirage—tall and ancient, tucked behind iron gates that creaked like they hadn’t been opened in years. Vines crawled up the walls. Statues lined the front path, all missing their eyes.

His grandparents came out to greet us.

They smiled too wide. Their hands were cold when they shook mine. The way they looked at me… it wasn’t normal. It was like they knew me already.

I tried to shrug it off.

The first couple of days weren’t bad. We fished in the lake. Explored the woods. Ate dinner in a giant dining room lit by old chandeliers that flickered every time I spoke.

But something was wrong.

There were **paintings** in the hallway that made me uneasy. They looked old—like, centuries-old. One of them had a man wearing a black crown, sitting on a throne made of bones. His eyes seemed to follow me no matter where I stood.

There was a **photo** on a door near the east wing. At first, I thought it was a god or a demon. But the more I stared at it, the more it looked like… a real person. Someone in a mask. The caption beneath it said, *“The Last Heir.”*

I didn’t sleep much that night.

The next day, Adam told me he had to go to some *“family prayer.”* He said it like it was normal, like every family disappears into a locked room at midnight.

“I’ll be back in an hour,” he said.

He never came back.

I waited in the guest room until the clock hit 2AM.

Then I heard something.

A low hum. Like chanting. Coming from the other side of the mansion.

I followed it barefoot through the dark hallways. Every step felt heavier than the last.

And when I reached the **red-covered door**, I felt it before I saw it.

Heat.

Whispers.

Movement.

I leaned down.

And looked through the keyhole.

*What I saw will haunt me for the rest of my life.*
