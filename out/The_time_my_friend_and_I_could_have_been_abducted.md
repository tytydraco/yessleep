This was back in 2017 and I have never posted this story before. I had a best friend named Alicia and in May that year we traveled to Düsseldorf, Germany together (We live in Sweden originally). It was just a few hours flight and we were there for five days. We didn't really have any specific plans when we arrived. We basically just took every day as it came and mostly went shopping and ate at restaurants, exploring the streets etc.

They had a grocery store very close to where we were staying and one sunny, warm day we were on our way back from the store. We got to the opposite side of the road and right outside a hair salon there was this guy who complimented Alicia's t-shirt as we walked by. She was wearing some rock band merch, like AC/DC or something like that. We stopped and talked to him for a while. He said his name was Teddy, which I thought was an unusual name. He had an African accent and was very friendly. He asked how old we were and where we were from. We told him we live in Sweden and that Alicia is of Indian origin. He asked how old we were and at that point she was 18 and I was 22. He said he could show us around Düsseldorf, take us to a bar downtown and afterwards we would take a walk and he would show us the beach. He kept repeating how lovely and beautiful that beach was and we just had to visit it before we were to go back home. 

Red flags showed up in my head immediately, but Alicia was like "Of course! That sounds wonderful!" I played along and Teddy told us to meet him there outside the salon at noon the next day. We were like "Sure thing," and then we walked back to our place. When we got inside our room I immediately was like "No way we're doing that!" And she was like "What? Come on! It could be fun!" I almost thought she was joking at first, but she was 100% serious. She wanted to let that stranger get us drunk at a bar and take us to a remote beach. I don't remember how the conversation went exactly, but after a while she managed to convince me. She said that we could just go to that bar and if we felt like we couldn't trust him we could just tell the bartender we needed help or something. "We're two, so what could happen? We have each other," I remember her saying.

So the next day came and we went back to that salon. We waited at noon, but couldn't see that Teddy guy anywhere. I think we waited for maybe five minutes and were just about to give up and go to the store when some random man showed up. He had long dreads and a Jamaican accent. "Hey! You were supposed to meet Teddy here, right?" he asked us. We looked at each other in confusion and were like "Uhm... Yeah. Where is he?" And this guy just said he couldn't come and that he would hang out with us instead. By this point we were both very skeptical, for obvious reasons. He asked us to come inside the salon with him and meet his family, because apparently they were the owners of the place. We agreed and walked inside. 

There were some women inside that greeted us. If I understood it correctly they were his mom and sisters. We talked to them for a bit, but felt extremely awkward. We noticed the women gave us weird looks as if they knew something we didn't. That was the feeling I got as we stood there and looked at all the pictures of women with different hairstyles. Most of the styles were dreads or rasta braids. The guy said he was just gonna go up to his apartment for a moment and told us to wait there. He lived right above the salon apparently.

We talked to the women for a bit about hairstyles and how we would love to get those kinds of braids etc. They still acted a bit suspicious and exchanged those looks as before. When the guy came back down he expected us to follow him someplace, but we had already decided this whole situation screamed “Get away”. We told him we had changed our minds about going to a bar and would just buy some liquor at the store and have a night in. He quickly said “Ok well, then I will go to the store with you because I need some groceries too.” 

He walked right behind us as we went to the store. Alicia and I were getting scared at this point, because this dude just seemed so strange and we had no idea what he wanted from us. As we walked around the store he was so close behind us all the time that if I stopped for a moment he’d walk right into me. Whenever we rounded a corner he basically ran to catch up with us and kept an eye on us every single second. She whispered to me “He’s watching us literally all the time,” and I was like “Yeah, I’ve noticed!” 

When we went to pay for our groceries we noticed he hadn’t even bought anything, even though he said he would go with us because he also needed to go to the store. As I paid for our stuff, he packed the bag for us. We walked out of the store and I grabbed the bag as he carried it, but he tightened his grip so as to not let me take it. He said “You can bring this up to my apartment and we can drink and have fun together.” I said “No, we told you we want to go back to our motel and have a night in. Give me our bag.” I yanked the bag, but he kept tightening his grip. He kept trying to get us to agree to spend the evening at his place. We kept saying no and eventually I grabbed his fingers with my other hand and bent them back so I could take the bag. Then I just said “No! Goodbye!” and we basically ran away from him across the road. 

We took a long detour back and walked all kinds of small roads with lots of turns. We kept looking behind us, making sure he wasn’t following us. Eventually, when we were certain he wasn’t behind us, we got back to the motel and settled in for the rest of that day. Luckily we didn’t see him again, nor that “Teddy”. My heart was racing and I realized it wasn’t impossible we were about to be victims of sexual abuse, or even worse, human trafficking. The rest of the night we drank our liquor and had fun, trying to forget about the whole ordeal. The remaining days of that week we made sure not to walk past that salon again.

Years later, I told this story to a guy I know. He knows a whole lot about how human trafficking works and in his words this was very likely one of those situations. The fact that the first two questions Teddy asked us were where we’re from, and how old we were, speaks volumes. Human traffickers usually want girls between 18-25 and the most common people to get trafficked for sexual purposes are Scandinavian female tourists. Whether this was one of those cases, or something else, I know those guys didn’t have good intentions either way and I am glad we got away. It’s an experience I will never forget for the worst of reasons.
