I had not really known Uncle Larry. He was an eccentric old fellow. He lived alone, never had a wife or children either. He worked at a grocery store in town and he had inherited his house from my grandmother, his mother. Now Uncle Larry was dead without any natural heirs and I had inherited his house, being his only living close relative aside from my parents. The news of his death and inheritance had come as a shock to us. The inheritance had been just the house and a little over 10,000 dollars, and as for the death - a massive heart attack. His body hadn’t been discovered until his boss had asked the police to do a wellness check on him. The house was a big farm out in the wilderness, maybe just one or two neighbours. Uncle Larry had asked me to visit quite a few times when he was alive, but I was always busy. Now I had to visit that very house to fix it up and sell it off.

The first few days in the house were uneventful. The scariest thing in the house was the risk of malaria due to the sheer amount of mosquitoes there. But then, one night when I was staying up late, I heard footsteps. It was about 3 am. As soon as I sat up in bed, the footsteps stopped. There was no more noise. It could have just been the old house creaking and groaning but I was a bit scared. I walked around the house with a flashlight, clearing all the rooms of the house. There was no one there, it seemed like I had just imagined it. The next day had been stressful, I had to make a lot of repairs, had to do a lot of cleaning. My wife had to call and scold me to keep me from overworking myself. I hit the bed early, utterly exhausted. Around 3 am, I woke up again. It was the same sound. Someone was walking around. It almost felt as if the sound was coming from beneath me even though the house had only one story and no basement. 

I stayed there for a while and listened to the sounds to confirm that they were real, unlike last night. I couldn’t hesitate any longer, so I called the cops. They said they will be there in 10 minutes. And those were 10 minutes that I spent absolutely horrified. I was curled up on my bed, frozen in horror. The scary thing was that the person seemed to have heard me and the footsteps stopped as soon as I spoke. When the cops arrived, I ran to the door, doing my best to not scream like a little girl. They checked the parameters, but they couldn’t find anything. They speculated that it must have just been a wild animal and that I should rest assured. I hesitantly agreed and they went on their way. I slept with my bedroom door locked that night and every night since. The footsteps were there every night though. 
Every night I’d wake up at the exact same time and listen to the footsteps underneath my feet. The footsteps would stop every time I stirred or made a single noise. I didn’t want to call the cops because they didn’t think the situation was serious and that I was simply paranoid. This went on for a week. I was growing increasingly distraught and sleepless every day. I started dreading nights. I just wanted to finish this work and go home. But then one day, I got a call from my wife. She was coming to visit me. I told her to stay away, but she said we had been apart for too long and she wanted to see me. She wouldn’t take no for an answer. That day was the day I decided enough was enough.

I went and bought a gun with my permit that very day. I waited for nightfall. I lay in my bed motionless, soundless. I was waiting for that dreaded sound. And after what felt like forever, I heard it. It was coming from under my feet, the floorboards. I took my gun and shot at the place where the sound seemed to be coming from. I heard a shrill cry and I heard more footsteps, retreating further away from my room and advancing towards the front door. I took my gun and ran after my underground tormentor. I tried shooting at the floorboards wherever I heard the footsteps but all I heard was a harsher cry and more hurried steps. Eventually they ran out of the house, but to my horror they continued underneath my garden as well. I followed them, all the while yelling and threatening until I found the door to a bunker. It was one of the shiny metal handle, hidden by foliage. I would have never found it under any other circumstances. 

That was when I heard cop car sirens followed by people telling me to drop my gun. Two police officers appeared in front of me, pointing their guns at me. I’m sure I looked like a crazed psycho in that situation and that the neighbours had called the cops after hearing the multiple gunshots. I dropped my gun and raised my hands up immediately, surrendering immediately. I frantically requested them to investigate the bunker. They were surprised at first at me saying that because there was not even supposed to be one there. But they listened to me after they saw the bunker handle. One of the cops went in the bunker, his gun drawn while one stayed outside with me in handcuffs. The next thing that we heard was a shriek from the bunker followed by “Darren?”. I was not going crazy, there had been someone there.

Apparently my eccentric uncle had a hobby that he liked to keep in the bunker - kidnapping young men and doing unspeakable things to them. Darren was a cashier in the same grocery store that my uncle had worked at and he had been missing since last june. He had been surviving on expired food kept in the bunker and dead mice since my uncle’s death. Every night he’d start pacing the bunker when he thought I was asleep but when I would make any noise, he’d stop moving because he was scared that it was my uncle coming down to punish him. He had no knowledge of my uncle’s death. The police took Darren away to the hospital and judging from the corpses in the bunker, Darren hadn’t been my uncle’s only victim and nor would have been his last, had he not died. I almost couldn’t believe it. My uncle had been eccentric but I never thought he was capable of something like that. Regardless, I couldn’t help but think of what would have happened if I had taken my uncle up on his offer. Would he have spared me since I was family? Or would I have suffered the same fate?
