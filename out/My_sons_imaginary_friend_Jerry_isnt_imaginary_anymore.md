My 5-year-old son had an imaginary friend named Jerry. At first.

It started with a drawing.

Crayons on paper. Big black teeth. No eyes. Long fingers reaching toward something… someone. The word “JERRY” scratched over and over again at the top like he was trying to warn me.

I asked who Jerry was.

“He lives under the floor,” my son said, not looking up. “He comes out when it’s quiet. He whispers in my belly so you won’t hear.”

“What does he whisper?”

“That you’re not my real daddy.”

I laughed. Nervously. But something in my chest sank. Like instinct. Like my body knew what my brain refused to.

That night, the dog clawed at the bedroom door for hours, whining until its paws bled. When I checked, nothing was wrong. Until I turned off the light.

That’s when I saw the imprint of a hand in the baby powder I had spilled earlier… under my son’s bed. A long, skeletal hand. Too big for a child. Too narrow for an adult.

I stayed up the next night. I left my phone recording by his bed.

3:13 AM. Static. Then breathing. Then a whisper.

“I like your skin. I want to wear it.”

Then my son’s voice: “Okay.”

I tore into the room. He was sleeping peacefully. But his pillow was missing. I found it later… under the bed, soaked in something thick and red. Not blood. Something darker. Smelled like wet rust and rotten leaves.

The next day, he drew a new picture. Three people in bed. A dark figure at the foot. The label: “DADDY.”

Only this time, the figure was smiling with my face.

I moved us to a hotel. No explanation to my wife. Just panic and instinct.

That night, I woke up choking.

A piece of paper was shoved in my mouth.

Crayon. My son’s handwriting.

“I LET HIM IN.”

I screamed. My son didn’t wake up. He was sitting on the floor, eyes rolled back. Mouth moving but no sound. Just mouthing two words again and again:

“Too… late.”

At 3:00 AM exactly, the closet door opened. Not creaked. Not swayed. It opened. And there he was.

Jerry.

No feet. Black arms too long to belong to a man. A mouth that split open sideways. No face, except mine. A mirrored, rotted version of me.

He crawled across the floor like something learning how to walk. Fast. Broken. Hungry.

I threw my son in the car. Drove three towns over. Didn’t stop.

He doesn’t sleep anymore. Neither do I.

He draws new things now. Every day. Pages full of symbols. Pages with our house, but burning. Pages with our bodies, drawn lifeless, sprawled in impossible positions. Always smiling. Always with Jerry behind us.

I tried burning the pictures. They come back. Under my pillow. On the walls. Once inside my car’s rearview mirror.

The worst one?

A drawing of my wife. Sleeping.

With her mouth sewn shut. And something pushing out through her skin from inside.

I went home today to check on her.

She wasn’t there.

But she left a note. In the mirror. Written backwards in a thick brown-red smear:

“JERRY SAYS THANK YOU.”

Last night, I fell asleep by accident.

I woke up with stitches in my stomach.

No pain. Just numbness. And blood.

I haven’t checked what’s inside yet.

But I think Jerry’s already there.

And I don’t think I’m going to wake up tomorrow as me.

He’s crawling out.

Piece by piece.
