My next-door neighbour is a serial killer, for weeks now I have watched the house across the street with a passive intensity, the elderly woman who lives there Mrs Fobb is charming, kind, and seemingly has a thing for tarpaulin. Every other week she can be seen washing a sheet in her garden, scrubbing it with an unrelenting favour until she either succumbs to tiredness, or succeeds in cleaning every last scrap of dirt from the sheet. This tenacious spirit also extends to her physical health, she jogs most days of the week, lifts weights, and has an active social life at the local community center on weekends, I watch as she gets into her car and departs down the street. 

 My girlfriends at work tell me I am paranoid, Amy they say ‘let it go’, it is true I am a little bit of a conspiracy theorist, but the recent spate of murders has piqued my interest, all the bodies were found naked and disembowelled. I leave my house via the front door and casually walk across the street, the warm and homely exterior of Mrs Fobb’s house may bely what I expect to find inside, I enter through the gate and walk around the side of the house, I find a key under a flowerpot. The house smells of maple syrup, with a distinct aroma of age, I waste no time heading up to the bedroom on the first floor where I am certain she keeps her trophies, I carefully look though a set of draws when I’m struck from behind, and reality becomes a blur. 

 The blackness gives way to more blackness as I begin to regain my senses, My eyes try to open but are glued shut, the stickiness extends all the way around my head, my hands are secured behind me by the same adhesive substance, my ankles are bound. A cold metallic sensation rises up in my back bringing me to the sudden realisation that I am naked, and lying on what feels like a concrete floor, ‘HELP!’ I scream at the top of my lungs while attempting to break free from my restraints. Just then what sounds like a door opens above me, numerous pairs of feet descend a flight of stairs, and a relentless chattering ensues, the voices sound old, with one carrying the unmistakable rasp of Mrs Fobb. 

 ‘This nosey bitch has been sniffing around me for over two weeks, watching me from her window, and now I have caught her upstairs in my draws’, another elderly voice chimed in ‘well if she wants to know we have to show her’. I was seized under the arms and ankles and carried struggling to a corner of the room, ‘get off of me I protested’ as I attempted a futile resistance, in the background I could hear a sheet of tarp being laid. The hands that gripped me temporary loosened and I fell forward only to be caught and again restrained, ‘Mrs Fobb please’ I begged ‘I live across the street, people are going to know’, an adhesive strip to my mouth checks any further attempt at reason. 

 I try to resist as I’m carried into the middle of the room and laid on the floor, the person who taped my mouth keeps the strip in check by smoothing it over my lips every few seconds, amid a chorus of ‘stop struggling’ other profanity, I reflect on my decision. I hear my work colleagues’ voices in my head ‘let it go’, ‘you are such a grind Amy’, these noises are interrupted by the sound of a blade, and a finger tracing my stomach, ‘you have to be precise’ a voice said. I thought somewhere in the distance I heard a police siren, but eventually resigned myself to the silence of my own thoughts, at that moment a sharp object pierced my stomach, and I felt no more.
