**02.13.06**

After years of silence, of watching and listening from the sidelines, I’ve finally earned the right to write. The elders gave me a paper and pencil today—nothing extraordinary, but to me, it feels like everything. It's a mark of trust, a sign that I’m ready to understand what they’ve always known, what they’ve kept hidden behind their cryptic, endless whispers. They didn’t say much, just a few words about the weight of knowledge and the importance of recording what I would soon learn.

So, here I am—starting this journal. It’s not just a place to write down thoughts, but a way to keep my sanity intact. I don’t know if I’m ready, but I have no choice. The cries outside my window are growing louder, and I can’t ignore them anymore. The town's secrets are becoming mine, and this journal will be my only way of holding onto myself as the truth unfolds.

It started last night. It wasn’t anything new, not at first. Every full moon, like clockwork, the town gathers to sing the Wailing Hymn. The song that keeps the Wailing at bay. Everyone knows the rules. No one questions it. I’ve lived here all my life. My family has lived here for generations. We all know the song. It’s tradition, a necessity, or so we’re told.

But last night, I... I didn’t sing.

I don’t know why. Maybe it was a slip. Maybe it was rebellion, though that’s a ridiculous thought. Rebellion against a song? But I didn’t sing. I stood in my living room, just watching the moon as it hovered in the sky, full and heavy. Something about it felt wrong, and instead of singing, I just stared.

The house around me was quiet. The whole town was quiet. I could hear the familiar creak of the floorboards under my feet and the hum of the refrigerator in the corner. But there was no sound from the streets, no hum of voices, no echo of the hymn. Nothing.

The Wailing Ceremony should have started long before then. By the time the moon reached its zenith, the streets should have been filled with people—everyone singing in perfect harmony. The whole town. It always felt like a wave, building and cresting and rolling over you. The sound of our voices blending together. We’d never missed it before.

Except, I did.

I didn’t feel compelled to join in. The weight of the silence felt strange, but I didn’t want to break it. I don’t know how to explain it. I stood there, staring at the moon, feeling this odd emptiness, this tugging inside me like something was missing. I could hear the faintest of sounds, but I dismissed them, telling myself it was nothing. The wind. An animal. The town is quiet at night—sometimes unnervingly so.

But then I heard it again. A soft cry. Not like the wailing song. Not like the song we sing every full moon. This was different. It was distant at first, almost a whisper carried on the breeze. I thought it was my imagination, or that it was just the wind playing tricks. It was such a small thing, so faint that I almost convinced myself I hadn’t heard it at all.

But then it came again. Louder this time. No, not louder—closer.

It wasn’t like the usual wail. There was something more desperate about it. I pulled the curtain back and looked out into the night. The street was empty. Not a soul in sight. I half expected someone to walk by, maybe just a stranger, maybe a latecomer to the ceremony. But there was no one.

Still, the cry came. And it wasn’t stopping. It wasn’t fading away. It wasn’t the wind. I knew it. I felt it in my bones. I had to get closer.

The cold air hit me when I opened the door, but I didn’t care. I stepped outside, standing on the stoop, trying to make sense of what was happening. There was something haunting about that cry—something almost... personal. Like it was calling me, tugging at me, drawing me in.

I looked toward the street again, listening, straining to hear it better. It wasn’t coming from the usual direction. It wasn’t coming from the town square. It wasn’t coming from anywhere I knew. But I couldn’t pinpoint where it was coming from. It seemed to be... surrounding me, just out of reach.

I shut the door behind me, the darkness pressing in. I walked to the edge of the yard, trying to find the source. I moved toward the road that led into the woods, the one that no one ever used after sundown. The one that everyone avoids, the one that doesn’t even look like a real road. It’s a place we all stay away from. The elders always said the road leads nowhere good, that no one should go beyond the last house on the street after dark.

I don’t know what made me walk that way. Maybe I was drawn to it, or maybe I just needed to prove that there was nothing to be afraid of. But the further I walked, the more the cry seemed to get louder. Closer. It was so soft at first, but now it was almost unmistakable—a sound that pierced the silence, like something calling from far away, something desperate.

When I reached the edge of the woods, I stopped. I didn’t dare step any further. The trees looked twisted in the moonlight, black and looming like jagged teeth waiting to devour. I could feel the cold air creeping along my skin, the weight of something watching me from the shadows.

The cry—it wasn’t a cry anymore. It had transformed into something else. A whisper? A song?

I don’t know. I can’t explain it. But it felt like it was pulling me closer, like the woods were alive, coaxing me in. I hesitated for a moment. The air felt thick with something I couldn’t name, and my feet felt rooted to the spot.

But then I heard something else. A soft shuffle behind me, the crack of a branch. I spun around, expecting to see someone, anyone—maybe a neighbor, maybe someone else who had forgotten. But there was no one there. Just the dark road stretching out before me, the trees stretching up into the sky. And yet the air felt heavy, as if the woods themselves were holding their breath.

I quickly turned and ran back to my house, heart pounding in my chest. I slammed the door shut behind me, locking it as if that would keep whatever was out there at bay.

I tried to convince myself it was nothing—just the wind, just my imagination. But I knew better. Something was wrong.

I stood at the window for what felt like hours, but the crying didn’t stop. I heard it, soft and distant, like the faintest of whispers, but it was always there. Every time I closed my eyes, I heard it, just outside.

The whole town should’ve been singing. But no one did. And I didn’t.

I don’t know if I was supposed to forget. Maybe forgetting is what caused it. Maybe... maybe it’s too late.

The full moon will rise again tomorrow. I can’t stop thinking about the sound. It’s getting closer.

It’s not my imagination anymore. Something is out there.

And I think I may have already started to lose track of what’s real.



**02.14.06**

I barely slept last night. It was the sound—the crying—that kept me awake. It wasn’t the kind of crying I’d heard before, not the soft, distant sobs that some might say were just the wind. No. This was different. There was a desperation to it, like someone—or something—was being torn apart by its own grief. I tried to block it out, but the sound was relentless, as if it was calling to me. Each time I closed my eyes, it was louder, closer.

By morning, I felt like I hadn’t rested at all. The elders seemed unfazed when I approached them with my discomfort, as if this was an old story they had long grown tired of. “You’ll get used to it,” one of them told me with a knowing look. “The wailing isn’t meant to be ignored. It’s part of the cycle.”

I didn’t press further. There’s always this sense of... distance between us. A wall of experience and knowledge that I can’t break through, not yet. Instead, they handed me a small, worn book—no bigger than the palm of my hand. I thought it might be something important, but they simply said, “Study it. Let it guide you.” It didn’t feel like an invitation. It felt like an order.

The cover of the book is plain, just a faded brown leather, but inside, there are strange symbols. I can’t make sense of most of them, but there’s a rhythm to the way they’re written, like a language I should know but don’t. I started trying to copy some of the symbols into this journal, but they don’t look right. They don’t feel right.

And that’s when I realized—the crying from last night? It didn’t stop. The moment I started writing, it returned. Louder than before, like it was outside my door, just beyond the threshold, calling to me. The words on the page seemed to blur, twisting in and out of focus as if the ink was being pulled into something darker. I had to close the book, hide it under my pillow, before the pull became unbearable.

The elders didn’t warn me about this. They never do. But I’ve learned something today—this journal, this book they gave me, and whatever it is I’m supposed to be learning, it’s all connected to the wailing. And I don’t think I can ignore it anymore.

I’m supposed to keep writing, I know that much. But what if the words start to turn against me, like everything else? What if I become the one wailing next?

I won’t let myself forget. I won’t stop. Not yet.



**02.15.06**

I woke up to the sound of wailing. Again.

But this time, it was different. It was sharper. Not just a distant cry from the wind, not just the faint echo of sorrowful souls. It felt like the sound was inside my head, as if it had burrowed into my thoughts. Every inch of my skull seemed to throb with it. The air in my room was thick, heavier than usual, and I could swear I smelled something burning—a sharp, metallic scent that lingered even after I opened the window.

I didn't know whether to run, to scream, or to just sit there and let it consume me.

Instead, I did what I do best: I hid. I closed my eyes and pressed my hands over my ears, hoping to block out the noise. But the wailing didn't stop. It twisted into something worse, something more unsettling. It was no longer a single cry—it was a chorus, a thousand voices singing the same mournful tune. I could almost feel the weight of their grief pressing down on me.

I don't know how long I stayed like that, curled in a ball on the floor, trying to drown out the sound. But eventually, the crying faded. It was replaced by a deep, pulsing silence that made my skin crawl.

I checked the book again.

The symbols inside were changing.

At first, it was barely noticeable, just a slight shift in the ink, a different stroke here and there. But now, the symbols were starting to rearrange themselves. They weren't just static anymore—they were *alive*. They seemed to writhe on the page, slithering like something dark was trying to crawl out from between the lines.

I had no idea what this meant. I could feel the pull again, that nagging sensation in my chest, telling me to keep reading, to understand, to unlock whatever this book was trying to show me. But I didn’t know how. I didn’t know if I even wanted to.

I tried to shake it off. I told myself it was just my imagination, just the exhaustion taking its toll. I’ve been hearing things before, haven’t I? Everyone hears things. Especially when they’re alone. The elders probably don’t even care that the book is messing with me. I’ve seen how they look at me, their eyes cold, distant, like I’m just a piece in a bigger puzzle they’re too busy to explain.

But something about today felt different. It’s like the whole town was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. The wailing had a rhythm now, like it was marking time, drawing closer. Not just outside my window, but in the streets too. The crying echoed from the farthest corners of the village, like it was pulling everything into its wake. I couldn’t escape it.

I decided to go outside, to get some air. The sky was overcast, the sun barely peeking through the thick clouds. It felt oppressive, like the whole sky was a lid ready to fall. The air was damp, and my skin prickled under the weight of it.

As I walked through the village, I noticed people moving differently. Their eyes were downcast, their steps quick and purposeful, as if they were avoiding something, something they didn’t want to acknowledge. I couldn’t stop staring at them, wondering if they could hear the same wailing I could. But none of them seemed to notice.

I stopped at the central square, where the fountain always used to run clear and clean. Now, it was muddy, stagnant. A thick film of algae coated the water’s surface, and the stone rim was covered in an unnatural blackness. The whole square felt wrong.

I walked closer to the fountain. My feet didn’t feel like my own, like they were moving of their own accord. My legs felt heavy, unsteady, like they were being dragged through molasses. But I couldn’t stop. I had to keep going.

As I neared the fountain, something caught my eye—a figure, standing just outside the square, barely visible in the mist. It was someone tall, their face hidden by a hood, and their hands were raised as if they were beckoning me. The figure stood so still, so unnervingly still, that I couldn’t breathe.

I froze in place, unable to move, unable to speak. The wailing had returned, louder now, almost deafening. But it was different this time. The sound was coming from the figure. It was them, crying—no, *wailing*—with such force that the very air seemed to vibrate.

Before I could react, the figure turned and vanished into the mist. I wanted to follow. I needed to know what was going on, why I was hearing this. But my legs wouldn’t cooperate. I felt rooted to the spot, like I was sinking into the earth.

When the crying stopped, I found myself staring at the spot where the figure had been. There was nothing there anymore. Just the empty, desolate square.

I hurried back to my room. My heart was pounding. The walls of the house felt like they were closing in on me. The book was waiting on my table, its pages still shifting, rearranging.

I couldn’t shake the feeling that something—*someone*—was watching me, waiting for me to make the next move. I glanced back at the door, at the window, at the corners of the room. I don’t know how, but I could feel them there, on the other side of the walls, beyond my reach. I’ve never felt more alone.

The book... it’s calling me again. I know it. It’s pulling me toward something, pulling me toward the wailing, toward the figure in the mist. I can’t ignore it. I have to find out what it means, even if it drives me mad.

I’m scared. But I can’t stop now. I’m not sure I want to.

The wailing is getting closer.



**02.16.06**

The wailing didn’t stop. I woke up to it again this morning, gnawing at my consciousness, lingering in the air, filling every crevice of my mind. The sound was raw, almost desperate, and it left a sour taste in my mouth, as if the sound itself was something tangible, something I could choke on. It was almost like the world outside had forgotten how to be quiet. There was no peace, only this ever-present hum of sorrow and torment.

I don't know how long I laid there, in the stillness of my room, just listening. The air felt thick, saturated with something unspoken. The wailing was softer now, as if it had retreated slightly, but I knew it wouldn’t last. It never does. And something about the sound, the way it wormed its way deeper into me with each passing second, unsettled me more than I cared to admit.

I sat up, my body heavy, unwilling to follow the call of the outside. My hands trembled slightly as I reached for the journal, the one that had been keeping me company these past few days. It had become more than just a book—more than just a place to vent my fears and frustrations. The pages had become a strange tether, a link to something I still didn’t understand. The symbols inside… they were changing, shifting, like the ink itself was alive.

I almost didn't want to open it. The book had become like a weight on my chest, pressing me down, suffocating me, but I couldn't ignore it. I never could. Not now.

I flipped through the pages, eyes scanning the marks I’d written, the notes I’d made in a frenzy the night before. But the symbols had shifted, as they always did. They no longer felt like words. They felt like they were staring back at me, daring me to understand them, to make sense of them. Some of the lines were more pronounced now, thicker, darker, and some had completely disappeared, leaving behind only faint impressions in the paper.

I stared at the page, at the symbols. I swear I could almost hear them whispering to me. My fingers trembled as I reached out and traced one of the marks with my fingertip. The paper beneath my touch seemed to thrum, to vibrate slightly as if it were alive, a pulse in sync with my own.

*I have to know what this means.*

I thought the words in my head, but even as I did, part of me wondered whether it was a good idea to keep going, to keep delving deeper into whatever this was. My heart felt tight in my chest, every beat heavy, laden with the weight of what I might uncover. But I couldn’t turn back. I *had* to know.

The wailing, now almost a constant buzz, still lingered just outside my window, growing louder with every passing moment. I could feel it pushing me forward, urging me to open the door, to step outside, to join the rest of them. To let it consume me. I wasn’t sure whether it was the town’s curse or my own growing obsession, but it was all I could think about.

I stood up abruptly, feeling dizzy, my feet unsteady as I crossed the room. I moved as if in a trance, every step deliberate, every movement slow. The door was there, just ahead of me, but I hesitated. My hand hovered above the knob, and for a moment, I thought I might just turn around, retreat back into the comfort of my solitude, the safety of my confusion.

But I couldn't.

I opened the door.

The air outside was cooler than I expected. It was heavy with mist, the kind that clung to your skin and wrapped around your lungs. It smelled damp, earthy, and thick. The village, too, seemed muffled. The streets were deserted, the houses closed off, their shutters tightly drawn, as though the people inside had sealed themselves away from the world. The wailing had stopped, or at least, I could no longer hear it.

A strange kind of silence fell over me, one that was worse than any noise could ever be. The absence of sound was almost oppressive. It was suffocating.

I walked through the village, my footsteps echoing off the stone path, each one heavier than the last. The ground felt strange underfoot, as if the earth itself was shifting beneath me. It was like I was walking through a dream—*a nightmare*, perhaps. The fog hung low around the corners of buildings, and the once-familiar shapes of the village blurred into shadow. The faces of the houses seemed to leer at me, their windows dark, hollow.

There was something wrong here. I couldn’t put my finger on it, but it was *wrong*. The wailing from before—was it really gone? Or was it just buried beneath the quiet, waiting for the right moment to resurface?

I passed the central square again. The fountain, which had once been a place of comfort, of cool water splashing in the heat, was now a stagnant pool, its waters still and dark. The same blackness coated the stone edges. But it wasn’t the fountain that caught my attention this time. It was the shadows.

They were... moving.

Not just the usual flicker of light and dark, not the normal way shadows stretch and shrink. These were different. They twitched, as if they had minds of their own, as if they were aware of me, watching me, waiting.

I stopped in my tracks. My heart was pounding in my chest, so loud I could hear it in my ears. The shadows stretched further into the square, creeping along the ground like tendrils of some ancient, malignant thing. They crawled up the walls, twisted and warped, curling into shapes that were wrong.

Something stirred within them.

I took a step back, but my feet wouldn’t obey. The shadows moved with me, sliding along the stone, like they were reaching for me. My breath caught in my throat. I wanted to run. But my body wouldn’t listen.

There, in the corner of my eye, I saw a figure.

It was barely visible, a silhouette against the mist. It was tall, too tall, impossibly so. Its limbs were unnaturally long, and the shape of its head—there was something about it that made my stomach turn. Its eyes were black, and they shone with an eerie light, a coldness that seemed to cut through the fog, cutting through me.

And then I heard it again.

The wailing.

But this time, it wasn’t just a distant sound. It was coming from the figure. It was coming from all around me. The voices echoed from every direction, drowning me in their cries, their pleas.

I wanted to scream, to shout, but my voice failed me. My chest was tight, and my legs were numb. I couldn’t move.

The figure took a step toward me, its shadow stretching far beyond its own body, reaching for me like a hungry, grasping thing.

And I *knew*—I knew this was it. This was the moment the town had warned me about. This was the wailing that had been chasing me all this time.

I wasn’t ready.

The shadow reached me.



**02.17.06**

I woke up in my bed, the sheets tangled around my legs, my body drenched in sweat. The room was still, the air thick with the remnants of the fog from the night before, and the wailing was gone. For now. But I could still feel it lingering, curling in the corners of my mind, its pull as tangible as the air I breathed.

I couldn’t remember how I had gotten back to my room. My head ached, and my body felt like it had been dragged through a storm. My skin still tingled, as if it had been touched by something other than just air. I sat up, looking around the room. Nothing had changed. The walls were the same, the floor the same worn wood beneath my feet. The book lay on the small table beside the bed, its pages open, staring at me like an accusing eye.

The symbols from yesterday—no, the symbols had *shifted* again. They weren’t the same, not entirely. Some marks were bolder, darker, while others had faded even more, nearly disappearing from the paper entirely. It was as if the journal itself was responding to something... but I didn’t know what.

I reached for it, the leather cool against my fingers. I could almost hear it creaking as I turned the pages, the sound far too loud in the otherwise quiet room. The ink had settled into strange, unreadable patterns, twisting and turning, much like the shadows I had seen last night. I felt the familiar tug in my chest—the need to decipher, to understand, to break free from this feeling of drowning in something I didn’t know how to control.

But as I traced the unfamiliar shapes, I felt something new. A presence. Not in the room, but in me. It was as though the book, the symbols, and the wailing had become part of my blood now, coursing through me. Something had changed. I could feel it in my bones.

I had to leave the room. I couldn’t stay here anymore. There was no comfort, no safety in these four walls. The village was still, too still. The silence that had followed the wailing was unbearable, like the calm before a storm. I needed to see what was happening, to understand what was wrong with the town, what was wrong with *me*.

I stood, the cold floor sending a jolt of sensation up my spine. The moment I stepped out of my room, I noticed something I hadn’t before—the air smelled different. It was heavier, almost like wet iron, like the scent after a storm. There was something… metallic about it, something unnerving.

The hallway stretched out before me, the dull flicker of the lightbulbs overhead casting long shadows that seemed to bend and twist as I walked. The quiet was oppressive. I half expected someone to jump out at me, to break the silence with a shout or a scream. But there was nothing.

As I reached the front door, the feeling hit me again—the weight of something pulling at me, tugging me outside. I gripped the handle, the metal cold in my hand. I paused before opening it, listening for any sound, any sign of life. There was nothing.

Outside, the fog had rolled back in, just as thick as before. The mist clung to the buildings, winding around the street like a ghost. The town was eerily quiet, the houses still, their windows dark. The streets were empty. Not a soul in sight.

The silence seemed wrong. Unnatural. The townspeople should be here, or at least their voices should be echoing from their homes, from the roads. But there was nothing. Just the endless fog, creeping and crawling along the ground.

I took a step forward, and then another, moving deeper into the heart of the village. The more I walked, the heavier the air became, pressing down on my chest, making each breath feel like I was pulling it through a thick blanket. I could almost taste the metallic tang in the air, as though something was burning just beneath the surface of the world, something waiting to break free.

I reached the center square again, the fountain still standing in its decaying glory. It hadn’t changed. But there was something about it now. It felt… wrong. Like it had always been wrong, like it had always been a part of the curse that bound this place together.

My eyes flicked to the shadows again. I couldn’t help it. The way they moved. They had shifted, as if they were waiting, watching. I stared at them, and for a moment, I thought I saw something else—something living within the shadows, something that wasn’t quite human. It was just a flicker, a movement in the corner of my eye, but it was enough to make my heart race.

I had to keep moving. If I stopped, I would be swallowed by it.

I passed the fountain, heading toward the main road. My feet crunched on the gravel, the sound unnervingly loud in the quiet. Every step felt like it echoed through the emptiness. There was no one. No one to explain the darkness that had settled over this place, no one to tell me what the wailing was, or why it wouldn’t stop.

The fog thickened with each step, wrapping itself around me, pulling me deeper into the unknown. It was like walking through a dream, a nightmare where the edges of reality had blurred and everything felt just a little too unreal. I should have turned back, but I couldn’t.

I couldn’t leave the questions unanswered.

I rounded the corner of one of the narrow streets and froze. There, standing in front of a small house, was a figure. It was tall, too tall, impossibly so. Its limbs were elongated, twisted at odd angles. The body was shadowed, its form barely visible against the fog, but I could see the gleam of its eyes—dark, endless black, like two pits staring into the abyss.

And then it moved.

The figure straightened, its long limbs stretching out toward me. Its head tilted, as if studying me, as if it was trying to understand what I was doing here, why I had come.

I wanted to scream. My throat was tight, my body frozen in place. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even breathe.

The figure took another step, and then another. The fog seemed to part in front of it, making way for its unnatural form. And with each step, the sound began.

The wailing.

It came from the figure. It came from the shadows around it. The sound was low at first, distant, like it had been muffled by the fog. But it grew louder, filling the air with its pain, its desperation, until it seemed to vibrate through my bones.

And then, the figure spoke.

Its voice wasn’t human. It wasn’t even a voice at all. It was a *whisper*, low and cold, a sound that seemed to come from the very depths of the earth.

"You forgot."

I took a step back, my heart pounding in my chest. The figure took another step forward.

I remembered.

The ceremony. The song. I had forgotten to sing.

But it was too late.

The wailing was inside me now. And there was no way to escape it.

The figure’s face twisted, its eyes widening with some unspoken understanding. It stepped closer, and I felt the weight of it, the pressure of the curse, pressing down on me. It was all too much.

I turned and ran.

But this time, the shadows followed.



**02.18.06**

I’m not sure how many days have passed since that night. Time doesn’t feel like it matters anymore. Everything feels like it’s shifting, bending, warping into something else—something beyond my understanding. The fog still hangs thick in the air, but it’s not the same as it was before. It’s like the whole village is suspended in a perpetual haze, and I’m trapped inside it, drifting between the past and whatever this is now.

I can hear it even now, the wailing. It’s not as distant as it used to be. It’s inside my head. It’s inside *me*. There’s no escaping it. The moment I close my eyes, it’s there, wailing louder than ever, demanding something from me, pulling at my soul. I don’t know if it’s real or just my mind breaking down, but I feel it, like an unbearable weight pushing down on my chest.

I woke up today—if you can even call it that. My body feels heavy, like I’ve been awake for days, but my mind is too tired to remember the details. The journal feels different now, too. When I open it, the pages shift on their own, the ink swirling into patterns that almost seem to follow my gaze. The symbols on the page seem to *watch* me. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s the only way I can describe it. The book is alive in some way, feeding off whatever it is that’s happened to me.

I went out again today. It’s become a habit now. I don’t know why I keep doing it, but something is pulling me to the square, to the fountain, to the center of this curse. I don’t think I can resist anymore. The town feels abandoned, even though I know people live here. I see their eyes, their haunted gazes when they pass me. They’re *waiting* for something, just like I am.

But there’s no answer.

There’s only the wailing. And now, it’s louder than it’s ever been.

I’ve stopped seeing the townspeople. I know they’re still here, somewhere, but it’s as if we’ve all been trapped in this endless loop. We walk around, we breathe, but we don’t live. Not really. Not anymore.

I tried to speak to one of them today, an older woman who I remember from the ceremony. Her face was pale, her eyes hollow, but she didn’t seem surprised when I approached her. When I asked her if she remembered the song, if she knew what was happening, she just stared at me for a long time.

She didn’t answer.

The wailing has taken everything from us. It’s inside each of us now, a part of us, something we can’t escape. I think that’s why they stop speaking, why they don’t engage. Because they know it’s too late. They know we’re all already *lost*.

It’5 in5ide me n0w, part 0f me, and I’m a part 0f it. We are b0und t0gether, cur5ed t0 exi5t in thi5 end1e55 cyc1e. There’5 n0 e5caping it.

S0 thi5 i5 the end 0f the j0urna1. The 1a5t entry. There’5 n0thing m0re t0 write, n0thing 1eft t0 5ay.

T0m0rr0w, I’11 be 0ut5ide. Wai1ing.

I ju5t h0pe 50me0ne remember5 t0 5ing.
