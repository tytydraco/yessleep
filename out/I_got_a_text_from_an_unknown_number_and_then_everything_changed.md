**"Have you found me yet?"**

The message blinked on my phone screen, an unfamiliar number flashing in the top corner. Confusion skittered through me, and suddenly the air in my apartment was stiflingly warm. I stared at the words, feeling a strange pull—not fear exactly, but something heavier. Denser. Like a memory I couldn’t quite place.

I tried to shake off the unease and locked my phone, tossing it onto the couch. It was probably some kind of spam. Ever since getting my new number in the summer I've been getting spam calls and messages more frequently. But as I turned to go back to work, the phone buzzed again, the vibration unnervingly loud against the silence.

I didn’t want to look, but my body moved on its own. The screen glowed with another message:

**"I’m closer than you think."**

I froze. My heart hammered against my ribs. My eyes darted to the window, then the door. Everything was locked. Secure. Still, the sensation of being watched was suffocating. I really need to put some curtains up.

A third message came before I could gather my thoughts:

**"Don’t turn around."**

The room felt suddenly wrong, like the angles didn’t line up the way they should. I wanted to laugh it off, to prove to myself that I was running on too much work and too little sleep. But my muscles refused to obey.

The seconds stretched into an eternity. Slowly, I reached for the phone with trembling fingers, typing back a single sentence:

**"Who is this?"**

The reply was instant:

**"You know me."**

I didn’t. Or at least, I didn’t think I did. But something about the words gnawed at the edges of my mind, like a dream I had forgotten upon waking. Memories surfaced unbidden: fragments of laughter, a whispered name I couldn’t fully grasp, and… darkness. Always darkness.

The room dimmed, though the lights hadn’t changed. The air grew heavy, pressing against my chest. I fought the instinct to turn around, to confront whatever impossible thing lingered behind me. My phone buzzed again, the sound a jagged knife in the silence.

**"Let me help you remember."**

The walls seemed to close in, the edges of my vision swaying. Images flashed behind my eyes—a spiral staircase descending into black, a symphony of whispers, and a face. My face. But it wasn’t me.

With a sudden burst of defiance, I whirled around. The room was empty. Yet the air vibrated with an almost inaudible hum, like a far-off whisper. My phone buzzed again in my hand, the screen now filled with a live video feed.

It was me, standing in the center of the room, phone in hand. But the version of me on the screen was smiling. Wide. Too wide.

**"Now you see,"** the reflection said, though my lips hadn’t moved. The voice was mine, yet deeper, layered with something ancient and cold.

Panic surged, and I dropped the phone, but the screen stayed lit. The reflection—the other me—stepped closer, closer, until it filled the screen entirely. Its eyes, my eyes, locked onto mine.

**"You’ve been looking for me all along."**

The room tilted, and the floor beneath me rippled like liquid. I fell, tumbling into darkness. When I landed, it was soft, almost comforting. The air smelled faintly of damp earth and… something metallic.

I looked up, expecting to see the ceiling of my apartment. Instead, I saw myself—the other me—standing above, phone in hand, looking down with that same too-wide smile.

**"Have you found me yet?"** it asked, and this time, I remembered everything.
