I live on the third floor of a six unit flat that overlooks a small neighborhood called DeMun.

I only mention this because I often find myself looking out at the night sky, fairly uninterrupted. I’m not saying it’s exactly National Geographic, I’m just saying I enjoy the nice view of the park and the little street of shops down below before bed.

But I haven't slept for three nights now, and it's all because of the goddamn castle floating right outside my bedroom window. Yeah, you heard that right. A castle. Big, gray, medieval if I had to describe it. Complete with towers and fluttering flags. 

It appeared on the first night, out of nowhere, like some ghost story no one told me I was in. I thought it was a dream. You know, the kind of dream where everything feels so vividly absurd you wake up laughing or shaking your head, swearing off late-night burritos.

So I closed the curtain and went back to bed.

But the next morning, as I dragged my ass to Kaldi's for my usual coffee, there it was. Still hanging up in the sky, like a hallucination that had decided to stick around for breakfast. I could feel it up there, its shadow stretching over my building, though nobody else seemed to notice.

On the second night, I remember hearing banging on my window. A sharp, deliberate sound like someone tapping with their knuckles or throwing small stones. It came in bursts, insistent enough to wake me but not quite enough to make me get out of bed. 

I just lay there, the blankets bunched in my fists, my eyes squeezed shut, too freaked out to look. My heart thudded so loudly I thought it might drown out the banging altogether, and eventually, it did. 

I told myself it was just my mind playing tricks, or maybe some loose branch brushing against the glass. But something about it. The pattern, the persistence. It made my skin crawl. 

Last night, the banging on my window returned.

It was softer at first, but quickly grew more insistent, demanding. 

My hands were clammy, my heart hammering in my chest. I knew I couldn’t ignore it forever. I had to know what was out there. So, with a deep breath, I stood up, my legs shaky, and walked to the window. Slowly, I pulled the curtain aside, just an inch, just enough to peek through.

What I saw made my heart nearly stop. 

There, hovering just outside my window, were two figures. They looked… I don’t even know how to say it… like miniature dolphins with arms… standing upright in black space suits.

Their skin seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. And their eyes were large, dark, and unblinking, fixed directly on me. They were standing on a floating red carpet, which hovered steadily in mid-air. 

They looked like they were waiting for me to do something.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry, my heart pounding in my ears. They didn’t move, didn’t make a sound. They just waited. I took a deep breath, then reached out and unlatched the window, pushing it open. The cold night air rushed in, making me shiver.

One of the figures stepped forward, inclining its head slightly. When it spoke, its voice was smooth, almost melodic. But it was just inaudible noises.

Clicks and whistles.

The other dolphin figure suddenly clicked and whistled. The main dolphin that was just speaking to me nodded, then used his hand to change a setting on his spacesuit.

It spoke again, but this time I could understand him. "By royal decree, you are hereby invited to dine with His Majesty tomorrow night, to discuss your opinion on Earth before its destruction."

The other figure reached into a fold of its robe and produced a small, glossy invitation, which it handed to me. I took it, my hands trembling, and before I could say anything, they both nodded, then rose up on their floating carpet, drifting away into the night sky.

I stood there for a long moment, staring at the invitation in my hand. My mind was reeling, my body frozen. A royal decree? Dinner with a king? What the hell was happening?

This morning, I went to Kaldi's, my head spinning, convinced I was having a complete mental breakdown. I kept my eyes down, avoiding everyone, the invitation tucked into my jacket pocket. I ordered my usual cold brew, barely able to focus on the barista as she took my order.

While I was waiting, she came over, holding my drink and glancing at something in her hand. "Hey, this is yours, right?" she asked, her eyes wide with curiosity. I looked down and saw she was holding the invitation.

My stomach dropped.

"Uh, yeah," I muttered, reaching for it. She handed it over, a grin spreading across her face.

"This is rad. Some kind of art thing?"

I forced a smile, my heart pounding. "Something like that," I said, taking the invitation and my drink, my hands trembling. I could feel her eyes on me as I turned away, the weight of the invitation suddenly all too real.

I found a seat in the corner, my mind racing.

Maybe I'm not losing it. Maybe this is actually happening. The castle, the figures, the invitation—it all feels impossible, but it's all been right in front of me. And tonight, I’m supposed to meet a king.

Some part of me still thinks I should check myself into the loony bin if I hear them banging on the window again tonight.
