Second night of being home alone. Of course gaming as usual. As I'm talking to my friend I realise it's already 1 AM and as always we decide to talk about creepy stuff. This time though, for some reason I got really on edge. This was one of the reasons I left all lights inside the house on.

To help you get a better understanding of the situation I need to explain the layout of the room I was in. It was a big room with two entrances. One of the entrances led to a corridor and the other one to a bedroom. The entrance to the bedroom was on the opposite wall of where the windows were and the one to the corridor on the wall next to the bedroom entrance.

We finished the game we were playing and decided it's time to go to sleep so I left the call. I got ready for bed and finally went to turn the room's light off. The key for the lights was right next to the door leading to the corridor. Just as I was about to turn it off I was facing the windows which had long vertical blinds. The moment the room got enveloped in darkness I noticed something on the blinds. As I was waiting for my eyes to adjust to the darkness the silhouette I was looking at became clearer and clearer and then... fear struck me. For a second I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. It was a man. A man's shadow. In a split second I turned the lights on. I didn't even know what to think at this moment. The only thought that came was to turn them off again and see if I didn't just imagine something since I was on edge from earlier. And so I did and once again... the same shadow on the blinds. This time right after I turned the lights back on I got the courage to go and check behind the blinds. And after quickly moving them I realised... there was nothing. 

I tried to calm down as I told myself that it was probably just a strange shadow cast from a tree, but I couldn't believe this. The shadow was so on point. It was literally like someone was standing outside my window. I somehow got the courage to go to sleep while this was still there just standing, almost like it's watching me.
 
Next day came. I did the usual stuff I do. Even though I felt fine during the day I just couldn't get what happened out of my head. I knew I was going to be home alone again. And I just kept thinking... what if I see this thing again. Would I be able to keep my composure this time?
I decided that this night I would go to bed earlier. I filled myself with courage. I got convinced that it was just my fear playing tricks on me. 

I went and started to turn off every light this time. Finally I got to the room I saw the shadow in turned off the light and... nothing. I felt a great relief and as I went to turn off the last light which was in the bedroom I turned around and to my surprise the shadow... it was there again. This time it was different though. The moment I moved I realised the shadow moved with me. A cold chill ran all over me as I realised. The shadow from last night didn't come from outside... SOMEONE WAS INSIDE MY HOUSE.

I slowly turned around again and immediately I noticed something strange under the bed in the bedroom. I almost choked. I tried to act normally even though I failed miserably. I left the room and went for the exit. The plan was to lock whoever was in the house inside it. And just as I was reaching the exit I heard a loud THUMP. I immediately blasted off and as I got out my key and started locking... BANG, the door got bashed from inside but I managed to hold and lock it right after. I immediately called 911 but the guy had escaped through a window.

From then on I always keep the door locked. I just know that no matter how low the chance is for something bad to happen, it exists and just as you think that it won't happen to you, misfortune enters.
