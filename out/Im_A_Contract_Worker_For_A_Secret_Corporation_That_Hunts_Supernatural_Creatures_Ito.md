Unfortunately, work had become slow. I was still getting jobs but they were so easy I barely remembered what I did each day. I even ended up going out on long walks to collect garbage to be burned as another source of income. I needed something better and soon. 

Lupa called with a request. I was desperate but not sure how desperate yet. Deciding to hear him out he told me an Agent was needed elsewhere and he wanted four people to investigate an old subway station. Three Agents and one Contract Worker felt like overkill. He must know something he wasn’t telling me. I accepted the job hoping the four of us would be enough for whatever was waiting for us.  

The three Agents arrived first. They waited for me at the entrance of a dark abandoned set of tracks. Two of them were strangers but I couldn’t hold back a smile when I saw Ito. A small hint of worry came over his face. He hadn’t known I was going to be here. 

“Is this alright?” I half whispered to him implying I would leave if he wanted. 

“Yes, this is fine, I wanted to see you. Let’s talk more later.”  

That sounded promising. I let myself get my hopes up for a second then needed to focus on the task at hand. 

The two other Agents introduced themselves as Bella and Shu. Bella was stocky with a warm voice and sharp eyes. Shu was taller, thin and meek. A long pale tail swayed at her feet and her ears were slightly larger than a human.  She held a short sword inside its sheath protectively in front of herself. Her dark eyes flickered to the ground and back letting Bella do all the talking. 

“From what we heard some kids have been doing some rituals down here. It looks harmless enough but we should make sure nothing has gotten through.” Bella explained not sounding overly worried. 

She was right. Considering all the rips between worlds happening lately we should take any chances.  

“I hear you have good eyesight. Do you notice anything?” She asked and gave me time to look things over. 

I focused hard on seeing through the darkness. It looked normal. A low amount of magic flowed through area because we were inside a city. The air felt heavy but that was just because the place had been locked up for so long. 

“It looks fine so far.” He commented. 

“I have a map of the area. Let’s try and have most of this done before nightfall.” Ito said and became the head of our group. 

Bella and him walked at a quick pace. My bad leg didn’t like the uneven ground so I lagged behind a little. Shu stayed a foot behind us, her sword still held tightly against her chest.  

“Come on Shu, don’t get left behind.” She said with a very slight hint of annoyance. 

“I’m just a little tired today...” Shu said in a soft voice that only carried because of the echo. 

“You’re always tired. Just power through and you can have a nap after this job.” Bella shrugged. 

Shu chewed on her lip, nodding instead of responding. From what I could see Shu had more internal magic than Bella. That might not mean she was the better of the pair in a fight. There was some friction between them however I felt as if they worked fine as partners. 

We carried on keeping an eye out for anything strange. I kept looking behind to make sure Shu didn’t get too far away. When I turned my head back, I didn’t see Ito or Bella. Shu stumbled on the tracks catching herself from falling at the last second. I went to her to make sure she was alright. Her magic flow looked fine yet she appeared exhausted. 

“How did we lose them?” Shu asked realizing Ito and Bella were gone. 

“This place might be a Loop.” I said standing next to her. 

Loops were simply just that. Places that for one reason or another created spaces inside of them that trapped people in an almost endless cycle. Despite the name, nearly all Loops had a way to be broken. Ito and Bella must be on the other side on the normal subway tracks while Shu and I were stuck here. 

“I brought along a snack. Here.” I pulled out a somewhat squished sticky bun.  

The sugar would be good for her. She fidgeted and accepted the treat. I waked off to the side to sit against the wall hoping she would join me. Shu did, her long legs tucked against her body, her suit pant legs were a bit too short and showed off her pale pink socks. Agents should wear black socks but most ignore that rule. 

“What kind of creature are you if you don’t mind me asking?” I asked to pass the time.  

She needed a break. Right now, I didn’t see any threats or had a reason to worry about Ito and Bella. 

“My species have been called a Dormouse, even though were not mice. We need to sleep for fourteen to sixteen hours a day or else we feel exhausted. We also are good at creating connections and doorways. I think most of the keys you’ve used to get places were made by me or my relatives.” She nodded. 

“Oh, thank you.” I told her thinking back to how many times a key had saved my life or got me home easily at the end of a long day. 

She appeared taken back that someone thanked her for doing her job. She accepted the words and silently ate the snack unsure of what else to say. 

When supernatural creatures say they’re good at a certain spell type of magic, it just meant it takes them less power to do so. If Bella and Shu made a doorway somewhere, Shu would use a third of magic Bella would. With less stable spells, they were also became harder to break. Since there were countless different types of creatures, all of them had special talents relating to their species. Like how August’s blood neutralized poisons to vampires having faster healing.  

From what I’ve heard creatures that sleep often tend to be sturdier than most. Shu should be able to tank a few hits better than Bella making them a good pair.  

“Do you feel well enough to keep moving?” I asked after a break. 

She nodded but still looked tired. I also felt exhausted no matter how much I slept lately. I couldn’t imagine how she dealt with it on top of working all the time. There was such a high demand for Agents I doubted she had enough time off to sleep as much as her body needed. 

“Tell me when you need another break.” I told her after we started walking again. 

“I’ve heard some stuff about you. The people who have been hurt by Hunters think you’re one playing a long con, but there are some that doubt that. For what’s it’s worth, I don’t think you’re a Hunter. Just a person that happened to be born into that sort of family.”  

I stopped for a second to listen to her. I had hoped the rumors started to die down.  From the sounds of things, I had a lot more work to prove myself.  

“What made you trust me?” I asked wondering if I had done anything special since we met. 

“A Hunter would never thank a creature like me and mean it. They’re good actors, but I can always tell.” She smiled shuffling her feet. 

At least there were still a few people on my side. We carried on walking down the dark tracks looking for a way out only to loop back to where we started. Shu had left the snack wrapper against the wall to mark where we had been which was smart. Our phones stopped working making it impossible to truly know how much time passed. The loop felt small. Only a mile at most. That meant it was weak and easy to be broken out of. Time acted different here. We could be stuck here for hours and yet only a few seconds would pass outside where Ito and Bella were. Had they even noticed us missing yet?  

“You don’t seem to be upset people dislike you because of your bloodline.” Shu spoke up after we walked in a circle for ages. 

I kept my eyes open for any clues on how to get outside. Most Loops were either controlled by a creature, or the natural magic formed a small pocket that trapped certain people that had something emotionally blocking them from moving forward in life. If we were stuck here because of the second option, I feared I would never leave. 

“I understand their feelings. Hunters kill supernatural creatures regardless if they harmed a human or not. They feel as if humans and creatures should not mix and their solution is genocide.” 

Yes, for the most part creatures harmed humans just by being near them. Even good people like August and April have probably killed someone innocent in the past because it was just their nature.  

“Are they wrong....?” She said mostly to herself. When she realized she spoken out loud she corrected herself. “Not the genocide part but I don’t think creatures and humans should be around each other. I understand that’s impossible. Most creatures depend on humans for food. Without them, they would die. Still...” 

April once had the same feelings. It was hard on her that she could love and care for humans and yet they were another food source for her. Some creatures didn’t have conflicted emotions about it. They deeply cared for humans and at the same time saw nothing wrong with killing them. 

“I can see both sides. Supernatural creatures treat this as a natural thing. Or some think it’s perfectly fine to kill a human for food if they committed a crime. Meanwhile, some people will this any kind of murder is bad regardless of the context. I don’t think people’s feelings are invalid. It’s just... complicated.” I sighed. 

I didn’t know how many people were hurt per year because of supernatural threats. The Corporation worked hard to keep an unknown balance between the two worlds. I didn’t think humans were much better. Most of us weren’t aware of how much pain and suffering went into our daily products. Our world couldn’t function without exploitation. Some days I thought we weren’t much better than some monsters. 

“I heard The Corporation was created by The Silver King to do tasks he doesn’t have the time for. I’ve always had the impression our King loves humans as much as he loves creatures. And yet I wonder why he lets so many suffer on both sides. The type of creatures that have to eat humans get a permitted numbered per year based on their species. Sure, there are some ethically sourced human meat gotten from morgues or organ donors whose bodies aren’t medically good enough. But...” She gripped her sword tighter holding it like a lifeline.  

I noticed how protective she acted towards it. It was as if it wasn’t a weapon to her but something far more precious. It had some magic imbued inside it, almost like a living creature. 

“Your sword seems special.” I commented trying to pull her out of a depressive train of thought and failing. 

We had stopped walking again. She paused to press a cheek against the hilt as if listening for something. 

“Have you heard of weapons created using parts of creatures?” She asked. 

I nodded. After death teeth, organs, nails and hair could be harvested from a creature for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes the bodies were just eaten by other creatures but if they were used by a talented person, they could create world ending weapons. 

“Have you ever come across one that was made by using an entire body?” 

I shook my head. Those were fairly rare. The process was difficult and mostly lost over time. Only a few Hunter families knew how as well as a tribe or two of wolves. 

“I heard rumors a Hunter family got a hold of a creature that could reproduce with any species. His off spring matured quickly and appeared like a teen after only a year. The family found out that their bodies were very good for weapons and spell parts. They had a stock pile started before The Corporation found out and defeated the Hunter family. The creature barely survived. Do you know what they did next? They made him and Agent after his body healed. He went a bit unstable but they still think he’s useful enough to keep. And all those weapons? Why bury hundreds of children when you have Agents who require weapons.” She let a long silence come between use. Shu couldn’t even raise her eyes to meet mine. “At times I like this job. It’s nice to help save people. And other times... I don’t know what I’m doing. It feels like we’re no better than the Hunters. If not worst. It's like some creatures need to suffer to ensure certain ones can eat.” 

No matter how much we talked about this it all felt as if one fact was clear. Creatures and humans should never have made contact with each other.  

“Aren’t you exhausted?” Shu asked in a very small voice almost guilty she felt this way. 

“Yes.” I agreed. “But I think sometimes all of this is worth it. As selfish as that sounds, I’m glad we met and became friends. I bet your sword is happy it found you too.”  

Some supernatural weapons made from entire body parts had a slight conciseness to them. They could tell when their owner treated them well or had preferences of what kind of tasks they wanted to do. Out of all the Agents who got such a tragic sword, I was relieved Shu held hers so gently. 

She raised her head, dark hair falling from her face. She bit her lip, her dark eyes damp reflecting the dim light. This kind of topic wasn’t one she could openly speak about with other Agents. Not only did she find someone who would listen to her but agreed with her feelings. 

Something shifted in the air around us. Somehow the Loop had been broken. It felt as if the ground under our feet moved and yet we stayed still. The world changed slightly. We were still standing in the middle of the subway tracks but a few feet away was Ito and Bella dealing with a new issue. 

Someone has painted odd symbols and words all along the tunnel in blood. Whatever ritual that waited for us had been activated. The room rumbled as Ito wisely ran further away from the large circle where a pressure started to come from. He grabbed a hold of my left hand, keeping his right free with magic threads ready to strike at the new threat. 

Bella stayed, brass knuckles on each hand ready to fight unaware what was waiting for her was something she couldn’t handle. 

To my horror I saw a terrible power come pouring out of the circle being summoned by unknown means we somehow triggered. It was vile and made my stomach roll. It was the same kind of power I’ve seen before and yet nothing like what I knew. If it was magic, it was a type that shouldn’t exist. I moved to do something, anything only to be far too slow. 

Shu raced forward acting like a shield for her partner. Bella was knocked back as the vile magic swarmed Shu’s body, her heart wrenching screams echoed through the tunnel. We stood helpless as that pressure over took her, transforming her body into something else. 

Her internal magic increased. She had grown ten time stronger and that strange magic festered under the surface mingling with her normal power. Her face grew long covered in soft grey fur. Her hands transformed into dark black claws. She stood on two legs and yet she appeared like an animal.  

Bella was confused. She didn’t understand how her partner changed but instantly she knew Shu was now a threat. She took a swing. Her first filled with power aiming to only knock out Shu. I watched in shock as her magic was blown away by Shu just glancing over. Bella’s attack never landed. She was tossed aside by a weak flick of Shu’s hand. 

Ito internally debated on what to do. He knew this was too much for us to handle. We needed help. If we left now, would we lose Shu? Would she go on hurting others before back up arrived? We needed to make a decision. 

Shu still held her sword in her hand. She looked down at it, a tired expression over her face. Carefully she set it down on the ground. Then, her body started to move as if she was side stepping out of this reality. Ito made his choice. We were following her. 

He attached a thread to her back so we would get dragged along. 

At first, I didn’t understand where we ended up. I couldn’t breathe, or rather, I didn’t need to breathe. Everything hurt as if I was suddenly set on fire. Then, countless threads wrapped around every part of my body aside from the left hand the held Ito’s. His threads protected us from the harsh environment enough for me to open my eyes. 

It was dark and yet had countless distant lights. Did we end up in space? No, not space as I knew it. This was the space between universes. A place where no living things should ever enter. Those countless lines were threads of magic.  

Not once had I ever considered where magic came from. I always assumed it was just another form of natural energy. As far as I could see, each dot, each world had a thin strand that was strong enough to carry a stream of power to each world from the main source. Looking down, I stared hard until I thought I saw some shapes come into view. When my mind realized what I was looking at it was almost too late. I only looked at it for a millisecond and it almost broke me.  

The main source that all magic came from... could you even call that thing alive? I didn’t understand it. I could never understand it because I was human. It wasn’t. It wasn’t even a creature. It was beyond anything. No words could describe it. And nothing could contain it. What scared me down to my every cell was an eye briefly looked back. Or something that could be considered an eye. A deep glowing silver the same base color of all the magic I’ve ever known knew we were here and was watching us from billions of years away. 

The odd power kept Shu protected in this space. Her suit dissolved away showing a thin fur covered body. Her clawed foot carefully rested on a thread like a tightrope. Somehow, I knew it was the thread that provided all the magic to the world we came from. The one where all the people I cared about lived. 

Her sharp claw nicked the thread causing something deep inside my chest to jolt. The thread was slightly cut but somehow magic still properly flowed. It strained against the weight, the thread slowly starting to snap as the seconds dragged on.  

Without any effort on her part, Shu could erase magic from every single world around us. Sure, some stronger creatures could live for years with their internal source but weaker creatures would instantly be killed. Others would turn on their own kind trying to stay alive. It would be a blood bath. All that pain, for what?  

I needed to do something. I could barely move because of the air around us. Ito was using all his strength to keep me alive. His suit was starting to dissolved and pieces of his face flaked away. Somehow, we needed a way to stop Shu and repair the thread at the same time.  

Since it was close I reached out and took it with my right hand trying to do anything. The sheer power overloaded everything. The only reason why I didn’t die was because my hand was almost instantly burned away. We needed a miracle. 

A new light came from beside me. Suddenly, it felt as if my world has already ended. Ito was calm even though half his face was missing. He was still able to tell me something. I hated myself so much that either due to the pain in the moment or the stress, I can’t remember his words.  

Supernatural creatures are able to burn up their soul to gain incredible strength for a few moments. In exchange for their death, they can go against any rules of magic, even preforming miracles. 

I couldn’t open my mouth to respond to him. I could do nothing but watch as Ito changed into something else. The threads covering my body glowed a soft light then faded, fusing into my skin. My right hand was reformed as I felt the threads working deep down stitching back older injuries. The light then appeared where the world thread was torn, repairing it then a bright burst exploded down the entire line. A warm feeling settled into my chest. Then a hollow feeling came so deep I thought I might collapse in on myself. 

Shu’s expression grew frantic. She cut at the thread again, her nails breaking. She increased her efforts until she was using all of her strength trying to follow through on what she thought would make the world better. Instead of the thread, something snapped inside her. 

That vile power disappeared after a loud crack. Her increased power stayed but she regained her senses as well as losing her protection from the air in this place. Before she was burned away, we were both jerked backward into the subway tracks where we started by a life line Ito placed ahead of time. 

I found myself on my knees gasping for air. Everything hurt in a way I never wanted to feel again. No matter how hard I tried it felt like I couldn’t get enough air into my lungs. I ran through what happened again in my head a thousand times a second. No matter how hard I tried, Ito’s words didn’t come through. 

Shu was in front of me wearing a simple white dress peacefully sleeping. She held a suit folded in her arms tied neatly with a black ribbon.  

Unaware of myself, I found my hand holding an old sharp piece of metal that had been forgotten along the tracks. I started at the sleeping Shu, the makeshift weapon ready to come down hard into flesh. Within a second the metal was stuck deep, blood flowing from the new wound. 

I was aware of the pain in my thigh but it stayed in the back of my mind. The empty feeling in my chest was far greater. It felt like I was watching my body move on its own as I pulled the metal from my thigh and stabbed it back down again trying to feel something. After ripping it out a second time the pain quickly faded. The wounds stitched themselves closed because of Ito’s last wish. He wanted his threads to keep his world together. 

“Oh, has everything been resolved?” 

Bella had wisely gone off and gotten a higherup to the scene. Unfortunately, that higherup was Lupa. He looked us over aware of what happened without a report. 

“Where is Agent Ito?” He asked calmly. 

My mouth stayed shut. I wanted to scream. To get up and punch his smug face in. My body refused to move. And I couldn’t bring myself to speak. Lupa nodded taking my silence as an answer. 

“He was a respectful Agent even in the end. He was good enough to return company property.” Lupa said gesturing to the folded suit. 

My jaw tightened as well as my hand around the sharp metal. Lupa took a step back almost afraid. He quickly collected himself waiting for me to speak. I didn’t. I just couldn’t. 

Bella came back with a medical worker behind her. She rushed to her partner looking Shu over praying she was alright. Her eyes landed on me and she almost appeared guilty for being thankful Shu was alive.  

Carefully, she helped the worker lift Shu off the ground for some treatment. More than likely she would become collared after being controlled by and unknown type of magic. Lupa was here and I could have asked him all sorts of questions about that power I’d see. I might even get some answers.  

An exhaustion down to my bones kept my brain from working. Finally, I stood up ready to walk away from this place. My right-hand shook. I wanted to do something. I didn’t know what. 

“Do you want another job today?” Lupa offered over his shoulder. 

His voice made my feet stop. He was taking advantage of me. And I didn’t care. I nodded ready to do anything he asked.  

My memories are hazy. He had a few nasty creatures that needed to be put down. How many days passed by? Two? Three? How many creatures did I fight? It was all just a blur. 

No matter how many times I was injured the pain in my chest always overshadowed the physical pain. Every time I was near death, a new type of fear ripped through my body. It took a while to figure out the reason for it. 

Just because magic was real it didn’t prove the existence of an afterlife. No one knew for certain what happened after we died. I accepted the fact there could be nothing at all. I wasn’t frightened of that. No, I was scared that there was an afterlife and I wouldn’t go to the same place as Ito. That I would never see him again in this life or the next, or the next.  

Deep down I was always afraid of this. That I would fade away while the people I cared about would carry on without us ever being able to see each other.  

At the same time, I almost wanted death. This pain was far too heavy to keep carrying. I would give almost anything to get rid of it. To just rest and stop thinking the same thing over again for just a single day. 

That wasn’t going to happen. I would always carry the memories of my mother, of my old partner and now of Ito unable to ever make new ones.  

Even though any wounds healed quickly my body finally gave out. I slept for a while, everything sore when I woke up. I couldn’t stay idle. I needed something to do so I started to accept more jobs. Anything. Maybe if I was very, very lucky I could forget about things even for a few moments.
