"Bye, see you tomorrow Brit" I said to my best friend Brittany, as we said our goodbyes, I headed over to my office. 

Upon entering it I see the worst thing possible in there. No, no corpses nor blood, but overdue work I was supposed to give to my boss yesterday.

 I gave a quick glance at the clock hanging on the wall. It was one of those big ones with Roman numerals. It showed 16:37.

 "Good, at least the day is over, I'll finish the work at home, I can't now" I mumbled to myself. I took my gray bag and packed it, I made sure I put everything there, and even triple checked, good, everything is in, time to get going and hit the road.

 As I walked out of my office and locked it, I stoped at the elevator. "Out of order" written in red. It's not the usual sign they put up when it's out of order but I didn't care enough. "Time to show why you bought the Cardio special gym membership" I said and snickered at my own joke, well, I took the stairs.

 It's a really tall building, 25 Floors. And my office had to be on the top because why not. It's not the first time anyway I had to walk down. Sometimes I had to walk up 25 Floors and my boss would question me for being late. 

I walked down the stairs, and on each floor, you had a big number written on it saying on which Floor you're on. It was going to take a while so I take out my iPod and plug my earphones in and counted on which floor I was.

 24th...23rd...22nd and etc. On roughly the 15th floor I saw a man with a large fedora hat and a faded trenchcoat. Something fellt off about this...thing, I said hello to it but it just stopped behind me and mumbled something in Latin or French, I don't know.

 But something about him made my gut hurt and something was telling me I'm in danger. I am usually the one who leaves the latest and its the first time I saw this man.

 It felt like I swallowed an entire boulder. I didn't think much of it until my skin ran cold and got goosebumps. The same man wearing that Fedora hat and faded trench coat. He appeared in front of me again. My stomach knotted itself a thousand and one times. He passed through me again and my iPod ran out of juice, the sudden stop of the music made my heart drop and shook me back to reality.

 I noticed I have been walking for longer than usual. I take a few steps down and what I saw was the most gut wrenching thing I saw, it's like I was dipped into hell itself and back. I've reached...Floor -12. "What the fuck" I said out loudly. I ran up to the ground floor but there were no doors. All of the windows disappeared as well.

 Whoosh, disappeared into thin air. But how?
I started panicking. Suddenly the lights turned off on the ground floor and the upper floors and some demonic noises came from what felt like 2 floors over me. I started running. While I was running my high-heels have up on me and broke.

 The noises keep coming closer and closer. I have reached floor -47 and the noises are always around the same distance away from me. While running I noticed that the floor numbers started bleaching away and that the hallways got dirtier and looking more abandoned the lower I got. 

At this point it's looking like an abandoned subway station that's been left for centuries. It was on floor -50 when I saw the man in the Trenchcoat again.

 This time I got a good look at him. It was...something but not someone. It's face was twisted, it's smile from one ear to another with yellow razor sharp teeth between the thin blistered lips.

 I noticed it had no eyes. All facial features missing but the mouth. My face ran cold and I tripped over him but he didn't seem to be affected by it. 

Update: I have been walking for a few hours now. I haven't seen the man ever since and I have no clue which floor I'm on. I'm loosing my mind and I keep hearing whispers telling me that the next time is the last time I'm ever going to see the man and I'm supposed to hug the man once I meet him for the last time.
