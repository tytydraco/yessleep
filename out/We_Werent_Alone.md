My name is Sergeant Jacob’s, third elite guard marine division. The current stardate is September 16th, 2132. The vessel I am currently aboard was meant to be a research vessel the NLS-Malgus, a sixer class modified freighter ship for scientific research on a planet we had prepared travel to called LK-461 (or 461 for short). I am writing this down as a last ditch attempt to anyone who attempts to boards our ship. I’ll broadcast this signal as much as I can. The malgus was equipped with several sections, a hydroponics area, living quarters, laboratories, a cargo hold, an engineering bay, the engine room, and a pilots deck.
We started out the mission as routine, we had just returned to our homebase on Earth, from a mission where we supplied human refugee’s fleeing another system. When we got the mission details for the current objective.

The mission in question was a research mission to 461, we were to gather supplies and mine the planet’s geological resources for another form of alternative fuel we were planning to mine, stabilize, and bring back home.
Earth is running out of energy, as we are amidst a crisis, and we aren’t the only vessel that’s been sent out this many lightyears with our shockdrives to perform certain missions.
My captain, Commander Jacob’s was appointed to lead the mission with a squad of six others including myself.
We made pod landing on the planet, before marking our locations and mining what little we could, before being sent back to the malgus.
However…someone…our chief security officer…Davis…he contracted a strange pathogen that made him sick. His face was fine at first, but he grew pale, almost grey in skin color. He began to vomit violently as we prepared for our return to the ship, and our commander left us with no choice but to kill and abandon Davis. I objected but he didn’t listen, he said to “move along with our cargo, as we have time to mourn later.”

We returned to the ship and I stared back at Davis’s corpse.…I chose not to stick around…
We boarded the ship and mourned him, he was a good friend, I’d known him for many missions.
We then began as normal on our route back to earth when a signal emerged from the cargo hold, our fellow soldier Voss, she was appointed to check it with two others. She returned covered in blood…and in a state of shock.
When our medical officer began to examine her she couldn’t speak, it was as if her vocal cords couldn’t work period. We left her in the medical bay and began to do a full sweep of the ship. One by one, the researchers began to disappear along with several crew members as we got closer to prepare the jump with the shockdrives.
Eventually we chose to finally check the disturbance, to my consistent begging of our captain.
We made it to the hold and found what Voss had seen. It was the mangled corpses of two of our squadmates. Younger men, both slaughtered, torn limb from limb, dejawed and mangled together like some shitty creation a child could make with macaroni and glue.

Only this time…there was…entrails.
And buckets of blood. Buckets….
we searched further and my fellow soldier, Helix followed behind me. We searched what we could before we separated, to cover more ground.
Before I knew it I heard him scream…
Oh god..his screams…
He pleaded for mercy so loud before you could hear his bones, shatter and crack before you could hear what sounded like water swishing in a bucket, I didn’t wanna stick around, so I ran back to the main deck where my captain was and pleaded for a containment of the cargo hold. We sealed all entrances and chose to drop the hold as it is a separate part of the ship. Once we did I sat back down with Voss to discuss what we’d seen…only…she was laid down, presumably asleep, until I saw it. Blood. On her shoulder. She’d died long before I came back, from what looked like internal injuries…
Her face was swollen almost like when you see a scramble victim, but…greyer.
More dead. More…inhuman.

We burned the body in the furnace of the medical bay, as it also served as the morgue of the ship. On our way halfway back to earth we felt the entire ship hurdle hard, as if something launched onto it from outside. We finally restabilized and realized something.
The ship was rattling. And something was banging below us.
The captain finally had enough and went to search below…before his screams echoed through the vents. I tried hunting the damn thing, but it was evasive, and the power had finally crashed under whatever had stopped our generators. we tried reaching the pilot deck, but found the controls destroyed. But we heard a…terrible screech, like a dozen voices screaming at once. Then that’s when I saw it. A humanoid figure…at the end of the hall down from the main door to the pilot deck. I slammed the door controls and shot it to avoid it getting further in. I grabbed my remaining squadmate Ferris, who I stumbled across on my way back to wherever it was I was trying to run to, and forced him to hide in a small room with me. He was terrified and shaken and I understand his feelings on this ordeal as we talked it through to a plan, a final shot at making this trip worth it. As we have started trying to send a message back once we get closer to home.

The point of this transmission is this.
If you see the malgus in orbit and you receive our transmission. Shoot it.
Blow it up, kill whatever is roaming in this ship as it is quick…and it isn’t human….it’s taken every life on this ship. You have to kill it. And can’t let it come back to earth.
We were stupid to think searching space was a good idea…we should’ve always known that we weren’t alone…
