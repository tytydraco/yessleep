This is going to be a short post, it’s just something I wanted to get off my mind. Back when I was young, I would hear a lot of scary stories from many different family members. What you are about to read isn’t something I heard when I was young, but instead someone else’s version of a story I once heard. Once I heard it from them, I just laughed it off and joked around. Truth is, I was scared because after hearing it I realized that I'd been to Gruntza, I’d met a man named Harold and I would never go to that town again.  

Here’s the story they told. 

“Gruntza, the town of death, pain and love. A family of three goes into a beautiful town, with very low crime, clean roads, clean streets, and no cracked windows can be seen. The mayor of the town, a man named Harold. This man has smooth white skin with no wrinkles, golden yellow eyes, and slick white hair. Harold loves to meet anyone new to the town, so it didn't take long before he met the family of three.” 

“A loving husband, stunning wife, and a kind daughter. The father got a job there while the wife and daughter stayed at home. One day while the father was working, the daughter had been spending time with a friend she had made. While the daughter and friend played in the front yard Harold had come over. He spoke to the wife for what would have been hours at least. Harold leaves and the wife calls out to her daughter, the friend hugs her and goes home.” 

“Days go by, and the father is still at work. The daughter asks her mother every day where her father is and gets the same answer about him being away on a trip. The daughter spends a night at her friend's place. The friend's mother is nowhere to be seen but her father stays home all day. The friend’s father had long black hair, a fluffy black beard, and hazel eyes, but the friend had brown eyes, maybe from her mother.” 

“One day while in her room, the daughter hears her mother pacing around the hallway in the house. She comes out of her room to see her mother in a panicked state. After a few minutes of talking the daughter goes back to her room, grabs some notes, pens and books. Hours go by before she can hear her mom go into her room, the daughter quietly opens her door, walks down the hallway, passes the living room, and out the front door.” 

“The daughter had put a few of her things into a bag, clothes, and a few other things she could grab before leaving. Thoughts running in her head, where is my father? What did Harold and her do? And why her mother's eyes weren't Blue anymore? So, she left. Town to town and never staying too long. She had many notes and wrote down the name of every town she stayed in.”  

“So, if you ever go into a new town, city, village or anything like that. Look out for a man named Harold.” 

I must have forgotten the version I heard when I was young, it was a really long time ago and so much has happened to me in that time. It’s also been a while since I went to a town called Gruntza. Coincidence? I don’t know, but I can’t tell that story yet. I’ll be seeing that person soon; I’m going to tell them what I went through and ask how they heard that story. That’s everything for now.
