 Chapter 1:  shifting  through time the story starts on a Tuesday afternoon with Michael a 24-year-old guy from San Francisco, California
Michael  was a normal guy with a normal job as a software engineer.

 he had no friends and no  love life  to  to speak of.

He was not an ugly guy.
 In fact, he was very handsome at about 6 feet tall with a short cropped beard and green eyes.

The reason he did not have friends, or a lady companion is because he liked, escaping into the Internet, most of his time.
  Michael walked into the dimly lit bedroom, and before he could even take two steps into the room his eyes were caught by the brilliantly glowing mirror propped against the wall of his bedroom.

Michael’s mouth fell open with a silent exclamation,  his drink, sandwich, and cell phone crashed to the floor, with a tremendous crash and a  tinkle of breaking glass.

Michael was not a coward however, and with a shake of his head he gathered his composure, and walked over to the glowing mirror which intrigued him.

The mirror was a full length mirror that Michael had had passed down in his family for the last three centuries or so he could remember.

The frame of the Majestic mirror was decorated with gold-trim wave patterns and ancient runes that he could not distinguish.

As he peered  into the looking glass he was amazed at what his eyes were seeing.

Michael was astonished.
 Instead of seeing the reflection of his bedroom like he would expect he saw a long glowing passageway extending for a few meters.

At the end of this passage, he saw what looked like to him to be  a futuristic surgical suite.

Michael then closed and open his eyes, and performed a series of reality checks. However, when he was finished, everything was still there.

With a start, Michael reached out a trembling hand and attempted to touch the mirror however, his hand passed directly through the silvery surface.

Four a  minute Michael debated with himself whether he should go through the glowing portal or not, and with a shrug of his shoulders he walked through and everything faded to black.


Chapter 2 : the awakening Michael woke to the prick of a needle in his neck and a robotic voice.

He is awake said a gentle robotic voice on his left side.

He then heard a human voice which sounded to him maybe like a   female. “wow carnella our procedure seems to have worked we have successfully brought back a healthy human from the middle of the  21st century”
Michael had enough of everyone talking around him and he still couldn’t see anything it was still pitch black.


With a stretch Michael spoke what in  the world  is going on here?
 Where the hell am I at?

 He then heard the android

On his left say  “My name is magnolia, we have managed to shift you from your base reality to this parallel reality, which is  further along in the timestream”.

 
There is a major conflict that troubles our hajiminy star  system and that is 
why we  have shifted you forward in the  timestream because we need your assistance, said carnella.
 
We have brought you forward to the year 2345
Please do not stress yourself.

 in a few minutes your mind should adjust to the implant that will help you survive better in our time.

Michael was so confused, and he wanted to get to the bottom of this.

What implant are you talking about.

   
(Carnella said)We have outfitted your body with our state of the art cybernetic implants which will allow  your mind to Connect and interphase with all devices and networks in our timeline, and which will allow you to do way more things than you are remotely used to in your time.

I am very sorry, but you might feel a brief bit of pain while we activate the systems, but trust me it is so worth it.


chapter 3: the implants  Michael then felt a blinding pain in his head as the girl carnella remove what felt like a cloth from around his head.


 please open your eyes Michael and tell me what you see she said.

Michael open his eyes and was amazed at what he saw all around him he seemed to be in the  futuristic operating room that he observed from the other side of the mirror however, now he could see it much better.

 the room was full, of different gadgets that he couldn’t even comprehend the scale of
But the thing that shocked Michael the most was the floating text and icons floating around him
And he’s saw apps and  advertisements and many other things but that was not as concerned at the moment and instinctively with a wave of his hand  all of the floating text, images, and icons vanished like they were never there.


Standing on his right side was a girl in a silvery dress that was made of some type of material he had never seen before but it looked similar to some kind of metallic cotton
The girl who he now knew to be was carnella was about 5.7 feet in height.


Michael  looked over beside the girl  and saw what appeared to be an android 
The android was about 4  feet tall with  bluish skin and a human like face that was very beautiful.
