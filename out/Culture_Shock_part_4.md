The screaming started at midnight.

I'd seen them hunt before, but this was different. The pregnant woman lay on the ground, still alive, while Susannah's family circled her like vultures. Their elongated tongues dripped saliva that sizzled on the earth. Elena had already torn open the woman's abdomen, but they weren't feeding yet. Just... watching.

"Please," the woman whimpered. "My baby..."

"Babies," Susannah corrected, inhaling deeply. "Twins. Can you smell it, James? The double heartbeats? The twice-blessed blood?"

The woman's eyes found mine, pleading. I stood frozen, my own transformation half-complete, wings pushing painfully through my shoulders. The hunger was there – God help me, it was there – but so was something else. Something that remembered being human.

"The first taste is yours, love." Susannah gestured gracefully. "It's traditional for new family members."

Elena laughed, the sound like breaking glass. "Remember how the others hesitated? Such weak stomachs. But you're different, aren't you, James?"

I stepped forward, fighting the nausea. The woman's heartbeat pounded in my ears. The scent of her terror was intoxicating. My tongue elongated involuntarily, and I saw my shadow on the ground – no longer human, but not yet the monster they wanted me to be.

Then Susannah's grandmother swooped down, impatient. Her tongue shot out like a whip, penetrating the woman's womb. The sound... God, the sound. Not just the woman's screams, but their laughter. Their glee. The wet, sucking noises as they began to feed.

I ran.

Behind me, their shrieks of displeasure cut through the night. Wings beat the air. But I kept running, my partially transformed body fighting itself, until I reached the albularyo's house on the edge of the village.

Maria opened the door before I could knock. "Finally," she said.

The old healer sat at a table laden with herbs, bones, and things I couldn't identify. The walls were lined with weapons I recognized from my research: stingray tails, whips made from black palm leaves, bottles of blessed oil.

"Your grandfather," I gasped, my tongue still inhuman, making speech difficult. "Maria said he was an aswang killer."

The old woman nodded. "Was. They got him last year. But not before he taught us everything he knew." She held up a long, dark tail that made my transformed flesh crawl. "Stingray tail, soaked in holy water and blessed under a full moon. The only thing that can truly kill them."

"The transformation..." I struggled to maintain my human form. "Can you stop it?"

"If you're sure that's what you want." She stirred something foul-smelling in a clay pot. "The cure will hurt more than the change did. And they'll know the moment you take it. They'll come for you."

"They're monsters." The words felt like acid in my throat.

Maria's laugh was bitter. "And what are you now?"

"Something in between," I admitted. "But I don't want to be what they are. What they want me to be. I saw them tonight... the way they killed..."

"Tell me about the hunt," the old woman commanded. "Every detail."

So I did. Described their ritualistic circling, the way they prolonged the terror, how they seemed to feed on fear as much as flesh. As I spoke, Maria pulled out an old journal bound in dark leather.

"My grandfather's records," she explained, opening to a page filled with detailed sketches of aswang anatomy. "Every weakness, every vulnerability. He spent his life studying how to kill them."

"And they killed him for it?"

"They tried." Her smile was sharp. "But not before he took three of them with him. Including Susannah's sister."

The old woman began grinding herbs with practiced motions. "Aswang are strong, but they have weaknesses. They can't cross circles of salt or garlic. Holy water burns them like acid. And a blessed stingray tail, struck through the heart..." She made a violent gesture. "It undoes the transformation. Permanently."

"You mean it kills them."

"It frees them," Maria corrected. "Even the oldest aswang was human once. Death is better than what they become."

A sound outside made us all freeze. A soft tapping, like long nails on glass. A tongue, impossibly long, slithered through a crack in the window.

The old woman moved with surprising speed, splashing holy water at the window. A shriek split the night. The tongue withdrew, smoking.

"They know you're here," Maria said, pressing a stingray tail into my hands. The touch burned, even through the cloth it was wrapped in. "They'll come in force now. Susannah may claim to love you, but you've seen what they do to those who reject them."

"I can't fight them," I protested. "I'm not even fully transformed. And Susannah..."

"Is not who you think she is." The old woman's eyes were hard. "Did you never wonder why they chose you? Your strong moral center, your capacity for love – these aren't qualities they admire. They're qualities they want to corrupt. To destroy."

Maria opened her grandfather's journal to a page covered in tallies. "Each mark is someone they 'turned.' Look at the patterns. Every generation, they select someone pure of heart. Someone strong. And they break them."

"Or consume them," the old woman added. "The men who refuse to turn completely... their flesh feeds the family's power. Their souls fuel their immortality."

Wings beat the air outside. Multiple pairs. The house creaked as something heavy landed on the roof.

"Choose now," Maria said, pressing a bottle of murky liquid into my other hand. "The cure... or the weapon. But choose quickly."

***

I didn't go back to Susannah's house that night. Or any night after. The old woman - Lola Rosa, as she insisted I call her - gave me a small room at the back of her house, its windows lined with salt and crushed garlic, its doorframe painted with prayers in ancient script. The transformation still pulled at me each sunset, but her herbs made it bearable. Mostly.

"The hunger never fully leaves," she warned me that first morning, brewing something that smelled like death but helped push back the wings trying to burst from my shoulders. "But you can learn to control it, rather than letting it control you."

I watched her work with her patients each day. People came from all over the province - mothers with sick children, old men with unexplained pains, and sometimes, in the dead of night, others like me. The not-quite-turned. The ones trying to fight back.

"There are more of us than you'd think," Maria told me one evening as we crushed herbs for Lola's potions. "People who got away before the change was complete. Some make it. Some don't." Her eyes darkened. "And some go back to them willingly, because the hunger becomes too much."

I understood that temptation. Every night I dreamed of hunting, of flesh, of the intoxicating power of flight. But worse were the dreams of Susannah - not as the monster I'd seen that night, but as she'd been in our quiet moments. Her laugh. Her touch. The way she'd looked at me like I was her whole world.

"They're watching the house," Maria said one morning, a week into my stay. She was teaching me to prepare holy water, adding specific herbs at precise moments of the boiling process. "I see them at sunset. Just waiting."

"Why don't they attack?" I asked.

Lola Rosa answered from where she was stringing garlic: "Because they're patient. They've existed for centuries. They can wait months, years even, for the right moment." She gave me a sharp look. "And because they know you're not ready to face them yet."

She was right. Despite the daily herbs that kept me mostly human, I could feel the aswang blood in my veins. Sometimes my tongue would elongate without warning. My teeth would sharpen at the scent of fresh meat. And the wings... God, the wings were the worst, always pressing against my skin, wanting to emerge.

"Your grandfather's journal," I said to Maria one day, watching her tend to a young mother who'd been visited by an aswang the night before. The woman would live, but she'd lost her unborn child. "Will you teach me?"

Maria glanced at Lola Rosa, who nodded slowly. That evening, they brought out the leather-bound book, its pages filled with detailed observations, drawings, and techniques for fighting the monsters I'd almost joined.

"The stingray tail is just the beginning," Maria explained, showing me intricate diagrams. "There are chants, prayers, specific ways to move, to strike. An aswang is strongest at night, but they have weaknesses. Points where their transformation is vulnerable. Places where their human flesh never fully gives way to monster."

I learned about the different types of aswang - not just the flying manananggal like Susannah's family, but others that walked on all fours, that could take the shape of birds or dogs, that could slip through the smallest cracks to reach their prey. Each had their weaknesses, their specific ways of being fought.

Some nights, when the hunger was worst, Maria would sit with me and tell stories of her grandfather. How he'd protected villages for decades. How he'd developed new ways to fight as the aswang evolved, adapted to modern life.

"They're not just monsters in the forest anymore," she said. "They have computers, cell phones, social media. They find their victims online, track them through dating apps. They adapt."

"Like Susannah found me," I realized.

"Yes. But you found us too. That's why they hate albularyo so much - we adapt too. We learn their new ways and find new ways to fight back."

Weeks passed. I learned to control the transformation better, to push back the changes before they could take hold. Learned which herbs burned monster flesh, which prayers could weaken their powers, which moon phases made them strongest and most vulnerable.

But I also learned darker things. In Lola Rosa's back room, behind locked doors, she kept records of all the aswang attacks in the region. Missing persons reports. Police photographs. Newspaper clippings of mysterious deaths stretching back decades.

"Your Susannah's family features prominently," she told me, spreading out grainy photos from the 1950s that showed the same faces, unaged. "They're one of the oldest lines. And the cruelest."

"Why are you showing me this?"

"Because when the time comes - and it will come - you need to be ready. Not just physically, but in your heart." She tapped a photo of Susannah, smiling benevolently at a group of children. "You need to understand that the woman you loved never really existed. She was always this. Always hunting."

That night, I heard wings overhead for the first time in weeks. Looking out my window, I saw Susannah perched on a nearby roof, beautiful and terrible in the moonlight. Our eyes met. She smiled, showing too many teeth.

"I miss you," she called softly. "We all miss you. Mother says your place at the table is still waiting."

I felt the pull - God, I felt it. The hunger rose, my body trying to change, to join her in the night sky. But Maria's hand gripped my shoulder, grounding me.

"Not yet," she whispered. "You're not ready yet."

"When will I be ready?"

"When you can look at her and see only the monster, not the memory."

Susannah watched us a moment longer, then spread her wings. "Soon, love," she called as she took flight. "Soon you'll remember what you really are."

But that was where she was wrong. Thanks to Lola Rosa's herbs and Maria's patience, I was starting to remember what I really was. What I could choose to be.

The next morning, I started weapons training. The stingray tail burned my palms, but I held on. Each day brought new lessons, new skills, new understanding of both the monsters and those who fought them.

"They'll come for you eventually," Lola Rosa warned as she watched me practice. "When you're stronger. When the stakes are higher."

"I know," I said, feeling the weight of the blessed weapon in my hands. "But I'll be ready."

Above us, storm clouds gathered. Somewhere in the village, a woman screamed - another victim, another hunt. But this time, I didn't feel the hunger. I felt something else. Something that had been growing stronger with each passing day.

Purpose.

The war between albularyo and aswang was ancient, but it wasn't over. And thanks to a cruel twist of fate - or perhaps destiny - I now straddled both worlds. Human enough to care, monster enough to fight.

The next time I faced Susannah, it wouldn't be as her almost-converted lover.

It would be as her enemy.

But that confrontation would have to wait. For now, there were more herbs to prepare, more prayers to learn, more weapons to master. And somewhere in the night, more victims to save.

The hunger still called, but softer now. Another voice was growing stronger - the voice of the hunter I was becoming.

Not a hunter of humans.

A hunter of monsters.
