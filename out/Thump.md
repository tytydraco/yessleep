I’ll be the first to admit I was in the wrong. I wish I could take it all back, start over. But, I can’t; I’ve ruined my life. I found a beautiful girl: smart, funny, everything a guy could want. Our engagement was right around the corner. We started making arrangements. I got her pregnant, so we decided this would be the ideal time for marriage.

But, I messed up. My impulse. I did the one thing you're not supposed to do. I cheated. I wish I could take it back. That pain in her eyes. She couldn't take it. She jumped through the window of our apartment on the 10th floor.

I should've stopped her. I should've been there for her. Every day I live in regret and fear of what I’ve done. I’ll never be able to recover from this. I didn't know she would take her own life. 

The nightmares began the day after her suicide. I dreamt that she would return to my home in a week. The dreams were so vivid, I couldn't help but take them as an omen. This disturbed me to no end. Of course, I wanted my soon-to-be wife back, but not like this. In the dreams, her bloodied body crept into my home. She glared at me with a look that chilled me to my bone: a mixture of sadness, confusion, and hatred.

I had to do something. I’m not a religious man, but I knew not who to turn to. I saw a priest, deciding to tell him my fears, he listened. But, I didn't tell him the full story. I was shameful. A freak accident, a sudden death, I said.

He decided these dreams may be worth proceeding with caution and gave me advice. The priest instructed me on the night exactly one week following her suicide, I was to hide under my bed. That way, when she returned home, she would not see me, and all would be normal again. As normal as it could be anyway.

The dreams persisted, growing more vivid by the day. And soon enough, that day arrived. I was jumpy. Goosebumps covered my body for the entire day. I dreaded what was to come. Follow the priest's advice, I said to myself. And then all of this would be over.

Night fell and I grew more and more alarmed. Every noise, every shadow sent me into a panic. The anticipation made me feel as if I’d die of fright. I crawled under the bed, waiting. I gasped, tears welling in my eyes. I kept picturing her.

I jolted out of my skin when I heard a thumping sound coming from the front door. I locked the door, but that didn't seem to matter because the sound drew closer. It was inside. I gritted my teeth, trying to will my body to quit shaking. The thumping grew louder. It was in my bedroom. My hair stood on end and I closed my eyes shut.

Closer and closer. And then it stopped. Right in front of my bed. I kept my eyes sealed, petrified in fear. I lay like this for several minutes. Had it worked? Was she gone? I didn't hear her leave. I decided to open my eyes.

I peered out from underneath my bed. I almost had a heart attack. She was staring right at me. That same dreaded look from my nightmares. I should have told the priest the full story.

You see, when she jumped, she landed headfirst, leaving her body a mangled mess. Hiding under the bed did me no good because her head was thumping on the floor, allowing her to look right at me.
