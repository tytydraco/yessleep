I should have turned around. Last night I found myself alone on a dark country road in Oregon, my car making that sick sputtering sound of a dying engine. I had already driven miles past the nearest gas station, and when the engine finally coughed and died just after midnight, I cursed myself for not filling up earlier. The needle was in the empty zone, there was no cell signal out here, and the hazards blinked away in the silence. I jiggled the ignition a few more times—nothing.

That’s when I saw her. A figure in the distance, standing by the side of the road. A woman in a tattered coat and red boots, waving at me. My headlights barely lit her up, but I could see her pale face and wild eyes. There was no town or house for miles, just black trees swallowed by fog. I rationalized: maybe she was in trouble. Maybe I shouldn’t have stopped.

My better judgment was screaming for me to keep driving, but something kept me on the brake. I rolled down the passenger window. It was freezing outside. The woman leaned in, thin hands gripping the door frame, long black hair tangled over her shoulders. In a trembling voice she told me her name was Mia, that her car had broken down a few miles back, and that she needed a ride to the next town. I glanced behind me; nothing was there except the dark sky.

Her voice was steady, not frantic. At first I hesitated—I’d heard every warning about picking up strangers at night. But her eyes looked so helpless. Against my gut I said, “Sure, hop in.”

Mia climbed into the passenger seat. She had no bags except a crumpled purse. As she settled in, the old car radio sputtered back to life—static at first, then nothing. She turned it off. An old country ballad flickered on for a moment before she shrugged and asked me to pull away. I could barely hear her quiet, “Thank you, I appreciate it,” over the engine’s rumble.

I tried to make small talk. “Where are you heading?” I asked as we slowly gained speed. Mia just shrugged, staring straight ahead. The car lurched as I accelerated. My headlights bounced off the thick pines lining the narrow road. Despite the heater blasting full, I felt a strange chill.

Ten minutes passed without a word. Mia was eerily still, her expression fixed like a statue. I stole a glance at her pale face; her eyes reflected nothing but darkness. I offered to call someone for help. She shook her head. There was no phone signal here, she said. She was fine, actually relieved, not to be alone.

And then she spoke again, almost too softly to hear: “Turn off the radio.” I nearly jumped. I hadn’t realized the country song was still playing faintly. I flicked the switch and the car was plunged into silence—just the hum of the engine and Mia’s calm breathing. I shivered. She smiled at me in the rearview mirror. “Thank you,” she whispered. “I’m okay now.”

Suddenly, a pair of bright high beams appeared behind us in the mirror. A truck had sped up behind, then slowed and drifted back. My stomach hit the floor. I hadn’t seen another vehicle on this road in hours. Mia’s eyes were fixed on the mirror too, but she said nothing.

Mia let out a soft laugh. “He must have thought I was hitchhiking. Strange, isn’t it? Me standing here after midnight,” she said with a shaky smile. I just nodded. In the side mirror I saw the truck had pulled over a bit further back, engine off. I couldn’t see who was inside, but it made me uneasy.

I told myself the driver was probably just worried, making sure we were safe. I glanced at Mia; she seemed almost satisfied. Then, without warning, the truck’s engine roared to life and it shot forward. There were no headlights or taillights—one second it was there, the next it was simply gone. The silence returned.

My hands shook on the wheel. I looked at Mia; she just gave me a calm smile. Her skin was unnaturally cold through her jacket. For one long moment we drove in silence, me breathing hard, her breathing quiet and steady.

Finally, the neon lights of a 24-hour gas station flickered ahead. Relief flooded me. “Turn here,” Mia said quietly, nodding toward the pumps. “Fill up the tank,” she explained. “They’ll be okay if I wait here.” I pulled in and the gravel crunched under my tires.

I hurried inside the station to prepay. The cashier gave me a questioning look, but I lied and said I was fine. “Be safe out there,” he said as I grabbed my change and turned to leave. I waved and rushed back outside, about to help Mia with the gas can… but she was gone. The passenger seat was empty.

A crumpled piece of paper lay on the seat. My breath caught as I recognized the number scrawled on it—it was the same number listed on a missing-person report I had glanced at earlier that day.

Then my phone buzzed. A text from an old, unsaved number: “Thanks for the ride.” I nearly dropped it. When I opened my messages, I saw other replies I never wrote—my own tone, but words I never typed. “Drive safe now,” one read. “Be careful on the road,” another.

I know this sounds insane, but I had to write it down. I’m sitting here under the flickering gas station sign, 3:47 AM, engine finally off. I still feel her eyes on me, even though she’s gone. Please—if you ever see a lone figure on a dark road late at night, think twice. Not all passengers are what they seem. Good night—or maybe tomorrow, if I’m lucky enough to wake up.
