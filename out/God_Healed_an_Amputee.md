Alondra was a faith healer, and like every single one of her kind, she was a complete and total fraud. She came from a long line of faith healers, those who would go town to town, set up a revival tent, preach a sermon, and then heal those who came forth, all in the name of God and money.

I worked for Alondra as part of her travelling revival show. My job was to vet audience members before the show began, helping decide which of them would be invited on stage to have hands laid upon them and supposedly be healed. I’d start my day in the parking lot, which was often just a field on the outskirts of whatever town we were visiting. I’d watch intently as people got out of their cars and headed toward the revival tent.

Typically, I’d keep an eye out for people who used a wheelchair to get around, but still had the ability to walk short distances. I’d spot them right away – the passenger door of their car would pop open, they’d slowly get out, and then shuffle over to the trunk of the car, where their companion would pull out their wheelchair and guide them into a seated position. These were the people who’d get invited onstage to be healed. I’d follow behind them and covertly listen in to their conversations so that I could pick up some useful tidbits of information, like their names. I’d take note of where they sat, and then pass all that information on to our production crew.

Sometimes I’d see people in wheelchairs who couldn’t walk even a little bit. There was no chance in hell they’d be invited up to the stage – after all, God will only heal those who can meet him halfway.

Now, just so you have an understanding of how everything worked, let me run you through a typical revival. Start by imagining this:

*It’s revival day, and the show is beginning. Alondra starts her sermon by spouting off whatever Biblical nonsense she’s decided to talk about that day. It usually centers around Jesus healing the faithful, but sometimes it’s completely random, just Bible quotes that Alondra selected from some deep recess of her memory.*

*While she’s busy telling lies to the believers, the crew coordinates which audience members are going to be invited onstage. I key my radio and speak to Kyle, our production supervisor. “The guy in the left section wearing a blue shirt and red Angels ballcap,” I say. “He’s in a wheelchair, but I saw him take some steps. He should go first. His name’s Lawrence. The wife is Shelly.” Kyle listens intently as I tell him about Lawrence and the others I vetted.*

*Alondra then brings the sermon back into focus by telling the crowd that she herself has been selected by Jesus Christ to carry out his work in the heartland of America. She takes a big dramatic pause and looks out to the expectant crowd, some of whom want to be healed, and some who just want to see God’s hand in action. She clears her throat and points her hands at the audience. “God is speaking to me right now,” she says. “He’s telling me there’s someone here who’s been in a lot of pain lately, someone who prays every day that he’ll be able to get up out of his wheelchair and dance with his wife once again.” She turns and looks directly at our mark. “Lawrence. Yes, you in the blue shirt. Christ is calling you. Come on up here with your beautiful wife Shelly.”*

*Lawrence and Shelly, faces full of happy tears, make their way to the front. Alondra tells them how special they are, how she knows that Lawrence has been dreaming about the day when he can stand and hold his wife close once again.*

*She lays a hand on Lawrence’s forehead and commands him to be healed. Immediately two of our stagehands run forward and lift him from his chair. Lawrence, adrenalin pulsing through his veins, puts his legs down and stands up. Whatever pain he may be feeling in his legs is eclipsed by the applause from the crowd, and a desire to not piss off Jesus. He takes a step. Then another. His wife reaches into her purse and puts all her money in a nearby donation bin. Others in the crowd do the same as Lawrence spins in a circle and smiles. The next person is called to the stage and the healing continues.*

And that’s how it went. Town to town, dollar to dollar. We mostly “healed” people in wheelchairs, but we would also “heal” those who suffered from any sort of chronic pain, and even cancer patients. It was by far the best paying job I ever had, and I grew close to everyone in the crew. We were a den of thieves and liars, but we were honest and noble amongst each other.

Alondra was middle-aged and very charismatic, both onstage and off. She could preach a sermon about watching paint dry, and it would somehow still be the best sermon you ever heard. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had all been faith healers. It was how she was raised, and she intrinsically knew what everyone around her needed to hear. She dominated any conversation she was part of, but she was always so interesting that nobody minded. When she wasn’t preaching, she spoke about hockey, purses, horses, TV shows, and pretty much anything except God and Jesus.

Kyle, our production supervisor, had once been a firm believer in Christ. Initially he’d joined up with Alondra under the belief that her powers were truly God-given, and not the result of trickery and deception. He was quickly disappointed, but soon found solace within the fat wads of cash he was making. During his first few years, he rationalized his actions by claiming that he’d donate his money to charity, but after a while he stopped saying that. There were ten of us in total who ran the show. I joined the crew knowing from the beginning that it was all a scam, but separating the foolish from their money didn’t bother me one bit.

The beginning of the end came one morning when Alondra walked out of her trailer and addressed the rest of us. “I’m going to heal an amputee,” she said matter-of-factly. We laughed. “No. I’m serious,” she said. “Jesus came to me in a dream last night. He told me how to do it.”

The rest of that day, all she could talk about was how Jesus had spoken to her, and that she’d never experienced anything like it before. “He glowed,” she recalled. “I’ve never felt so at peace than when he was with me. I was sitting at a large table with him. And then, suddenly, there were eight of him, and they all spoke in unison, telling me exactly what I need to know.”

It was weird. I mean, here was a woman who never discussed God or Jesus unless she was trying to con people out of their money, and all the sudden, in the most earnest way, she was telling us how great Jesus was, and that she had dreamed about EIGHT copies of him. We kept trying to laugh it off, but that only made her more insistent that she had a newly divine purpose.

At that point, we had a couple more days before our next revival. We were camped outside some Podunk town, still setting up our tent and equipment. Alondra pulled me aside and spoke to me. “I need you to go to the ocean and get some seaweed. Burn it on the sand and then bring the ash back to me.”

“What?!” I said.

“I need ash from seaweed.  The seaweed needs to be burned on the sand. It can’t be done any place else, and it must be done today. That’s what Jesus told me.”

I protested. “Are you insane? Even if I wanted to, we’re two-hundred miles from the ocean!”

“We have time,” she said, holding out the key to her Mercedes. “Take my car.”

“Can’t you go?” I asked.

She shook her head. “No. I have to stay here and meditate.”

“Since when do you meditate?” I asked.

She ignored my question and forced the car key into my hand and smiled. “Make sure you do it right. If you don’t follow the directions exactly, I’ll know.” She turned around and walked back to her trailer.

I quickly found Kyle, who was helping set up the tent. “Alondra is acting really weird,” I said.

“Gee, ya think?” Kyle replied.

“She’s making me drive to the ocean and bring back some seaweed.”

“What?” Kyle said as he took off his hat and scratched his head in confusion, “There’s too much work here!”

“Why don’t you go speak to her?” I asked. “Maybe you can talk some sense into her.”

“I’ll be right back.” Kyle stormed off to her trailer, but not more than five minutes later, he returned. He was clearly distressed. “Maybe you should just go do it,” he said with shaky hands. “I don’t think I can reason with her right now.”

I looked down at the car key in my hand. “Really?”

“Think of it as a day at the beach. At least it gets you out of helping with the set up,” he said.

I clamped my hand around the key while pondering my options. “There’s no way I’m going to drive two-hundred miles to the ocean! Maybe I’ll just go into town and catch a couple of movies. Alondra won’t know the difference, and I’ll just pick up some ashes from that campsite over the hill.”

Kyle glanced over at Alondra’s trailer and shook his head, almost like he was in fear of her. “No, she’ll know if you don’t do it right.”

“Man, what did she say to you?” I asked.

“It’s not really what she said, it’s how she said it,” he replied. “She told me to tell you to do as she asked. But the way she spoke her words…” he trailed off for a moment. “It just made me scared. I can’t really explain it.”

I rolled my eyes, but I knew there was no more discussion to be had. Anyway, Alondra had always paid me well and treated me like family. I supposed it wouldn’t kill me to do what she asked. I got into her car and drove off, giving Kyle a wave of my hand as I passed him.

Once I hit the open highway, I floored the gas pedal and watched the scenery zip by. It took me less than three hours to get to the coast. As I passed through a small beach town, I spotted a touristy general store. I knew that if I was going to burn seaweed on the beach, I’d need a few supplies. I pulled in and bought a lighter, a flat metal pan to collect the ash, and a plastic container to hold the ash for the drive home. By that point I was already within walking distance of the coast, so I darted across the coastal highway and made my way to the sand. It was an overcast, off-season day, so I had the beach pretty much to myself.

After a few minutes of walking along the coastline, I saw a floating patch of seaweed, not too far from the shore. I removed my shoes and socks and waded into the ocean. When I got to the patch, I saw little sea critters, who’d been using the patch as a hideaway, flitter off into the green-hued water. I grabbed a mass of seaweed and tried to tear off a chunk. When that proved difficult, I got out my pocketknife and cut off a large piece, and then returned to the sand.

Like any regular, sane person, I’d never tried to burn seaweed before, so I wasn’t exactly sure how it should be done. After trying a few different things, what I found worked best was simply holding the seaweed in one hand, and the flaming lighter in the other, and then putting the two together to let the seaweed cook. The seaweed was wet, obviously, so it took a while for all the water to boil off.

As the seaweed began to darken and bubble, the most ungodly smell hit me. Now, I wasn’t expecting it to smell good – seaweed never does, but I guess I was at least expecting it to smell like the ocean. Instead, the odor could only be described as a combination of dog crap and burning plastic. It was so awful that after a while, it caused a sense of dread to form in the pit of my stomach, as if I was doing something so unnatural that the Earth itself was telling me to stop. Nonetheless, I pressed on, mostly because I’d already gone so far that I was determined to see it through. A massive headache spread from my left temple to my right temple, which I tried my best to ignore. When the seaweed finally started to turn to ash, which took a long time, by the way, I let it fall into my pan, and then used my pocketknife to scrape it into the plastic container. I discarded the pan and lighter on the sand, and after a moment of thought, I discarded my pocketknife too. It was a contaminated item, and I didn’t want it any longer.

I rinsed my hands off in the ocean for a good long minute, and then walked back to Alondra’s Mercedes. I tossed the container of ash in the trunk and headed back, fighting off the throbbing headache and trying to focus on my long drive. I drove much slower than before, and I returned well after dark, when everyone else was asleep. I stumbled into my trailer, trying hard not to wake my roomies, and collapsed onto my bed.

I awoke the next morning feeling much better. I retrieved the container of ash and gave it to Alondra, who looked exceedingly pleased. She opened the container and rubbed the tip of her finger in the ash. “Thank you, bringer of ash,” she said as she grazed her ashy finger against my forehead, leaving a small mark in its wake. “You will be rewarded.”

She acted as if there was no foul smell at all as she put the cap back on the container, but I almost vomited. Once she was out of sight, I ran to look for some water to rinse the ash from my forehead. Not only did it stink, but it also caused a burning sensation. I found a ten-gallon water cooler and pretty much used all of it to wash my head. There was still a red mark where the ash had been, but otherwise I seemed okay. Alondra kept to herself the rest of that day, while I focused on my work, doing my best to avoid thinking about the task I’d performed. When I ran into Kyle, it seemed that he was in a better mood, after having been spooked by Alondra the day before.

Our revival was scheduled for a day later, and while Kyle truthfully assured Alondra that he’d found an amputee for her to heal, he separately told all of us to play it like any regular revival. “We’ll do the wheelchair people first, and maybe a couple of cancer patients,” he told us. “I’ve arranged for an amputee to be in the audience, so once the money is collected, he can go up there and Alondra can do whatever it is she thinks she’s going to do.” He glanced over his shoulder to make sure Alondra wasn’t looking. “I swear, if she wasn’t the boss…” he trailed off before telling us to get to work.

The next day, as the fools from the town began to show up, we assumed our roles. I blended into the crowd and spied on those who were arriving, selecting targets and gathering information. Everything went as expected, right up until the point that the show began. Alondra’s sermon was different this time. Instead of talking about Jesus healing lepers, or sick servants, or friend’s mothers, she seemed indignant, maybe even furious. She stayed laser-focused, talking angrily about the wages of sin, and other bullcrap like that.

As she ended her sermon, and the show began to segue over to the healing, Kyle came over the radio to give Alondra her first patient. “Fat man with the blue shirt and long mustache. Second row. Name’s Joe.”

Alondra nonchalantly reached up and removed her tiny earpiece, letting it fall to the stage floor. She’d just disconnected herself from the rest of us. I could hear Kyle react. “Alondra! Alondra what are you doing?” But of course, she could no longer hear him.

Alondra looked out to the audience and then pointed directly to Kyle’s planted amputee. “You! The lord is calling you up here!” Our lighting tech quickly adjusted to the unexpected change in the show and re-aimed the spotlight at the man with only one arm.

I heard Kyle’s voice coming through the radio again. “Oh crap!”

We all looked at each other uneasily as the man rose from his chair and approached Alondra. I’m not sure where Kyle found this guy, but it soon became apparent that he hadn’t done a very good job vetting him. The guy was gruff looking dude.

Alondra greeted him with the biggest smile I’d ever seen. “Please, tell us your name.”

“Henry Woodruff,” the man said curtly.

“And what brings you to seek out the Lord today?”

Apparently, nobody’d mentioned to Henry that he was supposed to be playing the role of a downtrodden, yet hopeful and god-fearing man who only wanted to be healed. “I was paid a hundred bucks to show up here.”

Alondra wasn’t bothered by the man’s tone at all. “And please tell us what led to your tragic situation.”

Henry looked down at the shoulder that had once held his arm. “Oh, you mean this unfortunate bit of business right here? Car accident. Drunk driver.”

“And have you found it in your heart to forgive this drunk driver?” Alondra asked.

Henry chuckled. “Yeah I forgive him every time I see him in the mirror.”

Alondra didn’t miss a beat. “Oh, so you were the drunk driver?”

Henry shrugged his shoulders. “It happens, ya know.”

“Well Henry, the lord forgives and heals all those who seek it, and the Lord will heal you here today.”

“Hey, me and the lord will be square as long as I get my hundred bucks,” he replied. The crowd was becoming noticeably uneasy as they shifted in their seats and muttered to themselves about the uncomfortable interaction happening on the stage. I took my earpiece out just so I didn’t have to listen to all the cuss words Kyle was spitting out.

Alondra reached for the container of ash that I’d provided her. The ushers, who normally helped to lift the healed from their wheelchairs, glanced at one another from the sidelines, not knowing exactly what their role was going to be in this healing. “Henry,” Alondra said as she reached for his sleeve, “may I see the spot where your arm was?”

Henry grunted his permission as Alondra pushed up the loose sleeve. She looked out to the audience. “Through the power of belief and prayer this man will grow a new arm!”

The audience gasped and leaned forward in their seats. Alondra opened the container, dipped two fingers in the ash, and the smeared it all over Henry’s stub. Henry wrinkled his nose as the smell hit him, and seconds later, the crowd began muttering their disdain over the smell too. I could tell from the look on Henry’s face that he couldn’t wait to collect his hundred dollars and then get the heck out of there. Alondra addressed one of the ushers. “Could you please hand me that prayer cloth over there?” The usher looked around and saw the cloth Alondra was referring to. He quickly retrieved it and brought it to her. She wrapped the cloth around the ash and held it in place. “Henry, do you feel the power of the lord coursing through you?”

Henry’s face turned pale. “It burns!” he shouted as he reflexively pulled away from her.

Again, not missing a beat, Alondra removed the cloth from the retreating Henry and looked to the crowd. “Now witness the POWER OF THE LORD!”

All of the sudden, Henry gave an excited yelp. “What the Hell?” he said as he glanced down at his shoulder. I didn’t have a good vantage point, but from what I could tell, there seemed to be something erupting from Henry’s stump. It was small at first, maybe the size of a finger, but quickly, and miraculously, it grew in length and thickness. It was a green wiggling appendage that made me feel nauseous just looking at it. After half a minute it must’ve been the size of an elephant’s trunk, but even then, its growth showed no signs of slowing.

Henry, who’d to that point had been shocked into silence while his new arm grew, let out the most awful scream I’d ever heard. The appendage began flailing around wildly, and by the wild expression on Henry’s face, it was obvious he had no control over its movements.

Upon hearing the scream, Alondra seemed to snap out of whatever holy fugue she’d been stuck in. For just a moment she had a wide-eyed expression on her face before she began to back away. The appendage, which by then was about ten feet long, could only be described as something that looked like a tentacle from of massive octopus. At first, it flailed around randomly along the stage, its movements like an out-of-control firehose fishtailing wildly on the floor. But suddenly, the movements of the tentacle seemed to become purposeful as it reached its full size. As Alondra continued to back away, the tentacle reached out and swept her feet from under her, causing her to land on her back. At that point Kyle came running onto the stage, reaching out to Alondra to try and help her up. The tentacle shot out and wrapped itself around his neck before he could even get to her, making several loops and then squeezing tight. His face instantly turned purple as he gasped for breath and clawed helplessly at the tentacle, trying to free himself.  

Henry looked to be in a panic, still having no control over what was happening with his newly sprouted appendage. He reached across his chest with his other arm and began striking at it in a vain attempt to wrest some sort of control over what was happening to his body, but his efforts were useless.

Alondra finally found enough wherewithal to right herself. Her legs wobbled as she stood up and tried to move away. The tentacle gave one last jerk around Kyle’s neck – even from my distant vantage point I could hear his neck snap. The tentacle tossed his rag-doll body toward the fleeing crowd, where it crashed into some empty folding chairs that had held spectators only moments before. The tentacle whipped across the stage and managed to grab onto Alondra, right before she almost managed to get away. It wrapped itself around her waist and lifted her up.

Amidst the screaming and panic of the audience, I locked eyes with Alondra as she was held high up in the air – she knew she was moments from death. Now, one thing you need to know about Alondra is that despite her deceitful professional life, to me she was like a big-sister, den-mother, and good friend, all rolled into one. She’d taken me in and gave me purpose when nobody else had. At that point I did what was perhaps the first selfless act in my life – I ran toward the stage to try and help her. 

I couldn’t get there fast enough though. The tentacle slammed Alondra to the floor, face first. It raised her up again as I ran on stage and jumped onto the thrashing tentacle, trying to use my weight to halt its movements, or at least slow them down. A stream of blood was gushing from Alondra’s nose, and most of her front teeth had been knocked out. I had a hard time holding onto the slick tentacle, and ended up slipping off and tumbling to the stage floor. The tentacle slammed Alondra to the ground a second time, even harder than the first. Then, it raised her up one last time, as if it was displaying its trophy to the world. Alondra’s final punishment came as the tentacle smashed her into the floor with so much force that the entire stage nearly collapsed from the impact.

It released her limp body and turned toward me. I’d already righted myself and had nearly moved out of its reach when I felt it wrap around my ankle. Its grasp felt like a vise clamping around my joint, and I could feel my bones crack under the stress.

The only thing that saved me is that Barry, one of our production assistants, came running in with an axe and began hacking at the tentacle. He landed one good blow, cutting deep into the appendage, but he didn’t get a chance to land a second one, as the tentacle released its grip from my ankle and reached out toward him. I took the opportunity to start crawling off the stage, but from the corner of my eye I saw that, rather than toy with Barry, the tentacle wasted no time and impaled him right through his abdomen, exiting out his backside. Barry had a look of surprise on his face as he dropped the axe to the floor. I kept crawling and managed to get myself off the stage.     

From what I could see of the audience, most of them had managed to flee, but at least two men had drawn guns and began firing once they had clear shots.

Bang – The first shot hit Henry right in the kneecap, causing him to crumple to the floor. This seemed to have no effect on the tentacle, and it continued to wave Barry’s impaled body around like it was a victory flag.

Bang Bang – the next two shots hit the tentacle directly, causing it to pull out of Barry, who fell lifelessly to the floor.

Bang – The fourth bullet sailed wide and struck another one of our production assistants who was behind the stage. He fell down face first.

Bang – The fifth shot hit Henry right in the middle of his forehead, blasting out through the back of his skull and carrying some brain matter along with it. Henry slumped over but couldn’t fall completely to the ground with the tentacle acting like a kickstand that kept him propped up. The tentacle continued to flop around like a fish pulled from a pond.

Another person, I don’t even know who, ran up to the stage, grabbed the loose axe, and began hacking away at the tentacle, managing to sever it from Henry’s body after many blows. Even then, it continued to twitch defiantly for another ten minutes.

Everything was a bloody mess. Barry, Alondra, Kyle and Henry were not only dead, but also barely recognizable as human. Our other production assistant, the one who’d been shot, was also dead.

Our audience went screaming to their homes, while at the same time, the police, fire department, and even state and federal agencies were summoned. But what sense could they make of the scene of carnage in front of them?

In the end, the official government report, and the mainstream news media, called it a mass shooting, even though only two people were killed by bullets. The report made no mention of the two-hundred eyewitness testimonies that said an octopus tentacle had grown from Henry’s stump, only that a tentacle had been found at the scene, and that it must’ve been used in some sort of previously undocumented pseudo-Christian ritual. One of the popular tabloid newspapers of the time, which had a reputation for distasteful gossip and sensational headlines, ran a fairly accurate article about the incident. But aside from that, everything seemed to get swept under the rug. Keep in mind this was many years ago, before everyone carried a smart phone in their pocket, so there was never any video footage of the incident.

I often think back to that day and try to figure out exactly what happened. The only conclusion I can come to is that, if you piss off God long enough, he responds. I don’t understand the meaning of Alondra’s dream, or why it flipped her so hard. I will say that I’ve become a better person. There’s a scar on my forehead where Alondra wiped the ash. For years after the incident, whenever I thought about engaging in some sort of unethical behavior, the scar would start to tingle, and I’d think better of it. Today, I work an honest job, and I’m teaching my children the value of honest work as well. However, I can’t go so far as to say that I’ve become religious, because no God that would kill my friends so mercilessly deserves my adulation. I understand some of you may feel otherwise – that maybe they deserved their fates – but your opinions are of no concern to me. Perhaps I just need more time.

I never paid too much attention to the sermons that Alondra delivered. They were, after all, lies spewed out of the mouth of a master liar. Nonetheless, some of the verses stuck in my mind, and while I know many people find comfort in the Bible, one of the verses she used to preach will always leave me feeling a little uneasy:

*Friends, do not avenge yourselves; instead, leave room for His wrath. For it is written: Vengeance belongs to Me; I will repay, says the Lord.* \- Romans 12:19

The skeptical have asked of faith healers, many times, “Why won’t God heal an amputee?”

To that, I say, “God did.”
