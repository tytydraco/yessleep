Recently, Dr. Fillow came over to look over my bad leg. The visit wasn’t promising. The leg was deteriorating regardless of how many magic-laced wrappings he used. I couldn’t afford a new one, and legs weren’t easy to come by even if I had the money. We settled on something that may unsettle most people. It was a layer of fake skin similar to a thigh-high sock. Anything it didn’t cover would be wrapped with bandages.   

After it was put on it made the leg that gave me pain for over two years appear almost normal. Aside from some tightness when I bent my knee, I had no new issues. A dull pain still came from my hip however I’d almost gotten used to it. The only reason why Dr.Fillow hadn’t provided this treatment before was because he didn’t have access to the right materials. I asked him what he used to make the new leg covering and he simply refused to answer stating it was better if I didn’t know. I didn’t press him for more information.   

That visit hurt my bank account. At least I was able to pick up a lot of smaller jobs. The Corporation offered a load of lower-paying tasks open to anyone who applied. It could be just collecting certain plants from a forest or helping a friendly supernatural creature find its way out of a city into a better habitat. These jobs often piled up. People wanted the flashy ones like saving the world or showing off how strong they were against a pack of rowdy wolves. The money wasn’t the best, but at least it was something.  

I didn’t realize how much I’d overworked myself until I nearly slept through a very important event. After a long day of trudging through mud looking for small lizards, I sat down on my bed to check my phone for messages. Within a few seconds, I had fallen asleep. My phone buzzing in my hand woke me. I had a few missed calls from August and texts wondering if I was still alive.  

I threw myself out of bed to get dressed in clean clothing then raced out of the door. I mentally cursed as I hurried over to Lucas’ school. His class was holding a small spring play I was now very late for. The auditorium was dark by the time I arrived. As silently as I could I found August and sat down next to him. He was recording as he watched the small group of children stumble across the stage with three teachers guiding them around. Each child wore a handmade costume. Some were ladybugs and others were bees. I arrived at a perfect time. Lucas took center stage for his big moment.   

August had found a large bee plush toy and gutted it to make an outfit for the small boy. It made him appear round with his short arms stiffly out at his sides. He stood in the middle of the stage, a calm yet almost unimpressed expression on his face then said his very well-practiced line.  

“Buzz Buzz.” Lucas said in a monotone voice.  

The teachers on stage hid their laughter and the crowd of adults covered theirs with coughs. August kept his phone raised recording every moment, his head turned away with tears in his eyes as he held back laughing at his son. Lucas went back to his spot and the play kept going for a few more minutes. It was hard to focus on the plot after that moment.  

Afterward, the lights came on as parents collected their children telling them how well they did. August scooped up Lucas holding him tight so proud of his boy for being able to perform in front of a crowd. Lucas complained he was hot so August helped him take his large costume off and adjusted his black clothing underneath. I noticed a few parents, single and otherwise watching him. I wondered how many of them tried to get his number so far.  

Glancing around the room I realized how different my childhood was compared to most people. I had no fond memories of school plays or parent-teacher meetings. We never stayed in one spot long enough for me to be a part of elementary events. Even after going into high school I never joined any clubs or kept the same friends for very long. I wasn’t unhappy with that sort of childhood but I regretted never going back to finish my education. I loved my mother and she did the best she could for me considering our situation, but she should have focused more on my schooling. No wonder most people I worked with thought I wasn’t the brightest bulb.  

“I need to talk with some teachers. Can you watch Lucas for a minute?” August asked.  

I agreed and picked him up noticing how much the play took out of him. His little hand touched my neck feeling the new scar.  

“Did that hurt?” He asked.  

Lucas was a good kid. I felt bad I hadn’t made the effort to see him enough lately. 

“No, not much.” I admitted and swayed him a little to cool him down. “Does it make me look tough?”  

Lucas pouted with an angry look. He was under the impression I was getting myself hurt to make myself look like a badass. Eyes were on us. The normal parents were trying to figure out who I was. I didn’t fit in here. All of the adults appeared put together meanwhile I had visible scars, long messy hair, and still smelled a bit like a bog. I should ask Evie how to use makeup to cover some scars in case I ever needed to be around these people again.  

Soon August came back to collect Lucas so they could head home. It was still early in the night but Lucas was over tired. He didn’t even want dinner, he just wanted to sleep. August offered for me to come over but I felt my phone go off in my pocket. Another job came in I should accept. We walked to the door ready to leave. We paused to say goodbye, Lucas already drifting off in his arms after a short walk. He reached out to touch the scar on my neck then poked it hard enough to make me pull away.  

“Scars don’t suit you.” He scolded me.  

“I’m a Contract Worker. It comes with the job.” I shrugged.  

“Are you happy?”  

His question stopped me in my tracks. My mouth opened to reply. The words refused to come. August had gone through a lot. More than I would ever know about. And yet he never stopped fighting so he could be in the place he was now.   

I had tried to live a normal life for two years. It was clear I was only suited for contract work. Or maybe becoming an Agent if Lupa had any say in the matter. But was I happy? No. Not really. I made new friends recently. It wasn’t as if I had something or someone to wake up for every morning. Right now, I am working to pay off a debt. Then what? Was my only option in life to work just so I could live?   

“I’m fine.” I told him and instantly saw August didn’t believe me.   

I raised my phone to tell him I had a job and I needed to go. He didn’t stop me. Lucas needed to get to bed. We didn’t have time to talk about my problems.  

An hour later I found myself bundled up in a thrifted heavy jacket knee-deep in snow hiking up a cold mountain. The sky started to get dark with some light snow coming down. A pair of Contract Workers were meant to join me on this job. They easily caught up. We were meant to investigate the cabin in the distance. I could see it but it would take me a while to reach it at my slow pace.  

“Wait, you’re Richmond, right?” One of the pair said.  

She had long thin legs and fluffy blonde hair that reminded me of feathers. Her partner stayed behind her, a nervous look on his face.  

“I am. If you don’t want to work with me then I can back out of this job.” I offered as the wind started to blow harder.  

It sucks that I would miss out on some work but there would always be more jobs. If these two weren’t comfortable around me I felt it would be unfair to them if I stayed. She huffed looking in my direction as if I was a pile of trash.  

“No. You took the offer first. We’ll leave. But do us a favor and don’t come off this mountain.” She hissed then stomped away.  

Her partner stayed behind for a moment. He didn’t share her feelings toward me.   

“Sorry. She’s been harmed by Hunters before. I don’t think you’re one. But...” He trailed off and was called to follow his partner.  

It seems as if I would be doing this job alone. That was fine. The weather started to get worse. I needed to get inside soon. I have no idea how long I slogged through the snow. The wind got so bad it forced my head down and sometimes took my breath away. I should have worn a hat or at least a scarf instead of just a jacket and light gloves. I raised my head to see how close the cabin was to see it a few feet away with the lights on. Had the lights been on when I last looked?  

A burst of cold slammed into the back of my head. I let out a shriek when snow rolled down the back of my jacket. A cackling came just before a set of strong arms grabbed around my stomach. I was lifted off the ground and shoved into the snow.  

The next few minutes were me fighting off the threat and losing.   

“Ok, I give up. You win. But what are you doing here?” I coughed.  

My entire body started to shake from a chill. April only wore a light jacket and a skirt. She had no issues with the cold and I was jealous.   

“We decided we wanted to hang out.” She told me.  

We? April helped me inside the warm cabin. Evie was next to the fireplace bundled up shivering. August sat at a wooden table going through some papers related to Lucas’ school and other activities.  

“What took you so long?” August asked looking up.   

I made my way next to Evie to warm up. Snow dripped off my jacket as I started to get feeling back into my fingers and toes. The new right arm wasn’t affected by the cold as much as my normal one. It still was enough to be uncomfortable.  

“I figured I would take a look to see if there was anything strange before I got here. But the snow got too heavy.” I explained.  

“Ugh. I wish someone told me we would be in a blizzard. The snow ruined my eyeliner. I look terrible.” Evie sniffed her face slightly red.  

She washed off most of her makeup and looked miserable.   

“You always look pretty.” I told her and gently nudged her shoulder.  

For some reason, an odd expression came over her face. I wondered if I stepped over a line I wasn’t aware of. Or maybe she was just tired. 

“I’m going to roll around outside for a while.” April announced then left to do just that.   

When I finally dried off, I hung up my jacket. August called to check in on Lucas to make sure he was still in bed while he was off working.  

“It’s nice his family offered to watch him. I guess they finally came to their sense and decided to work with you so Lucas can have an easier time.” Evie commented from her spot on the couch near the fire.  

I glanced at August who refused to make eye contact with me. He hadn’t told Evie what he’d done. If she knew she may need to report it. I didn’t want to think about what trouble that might cause him.  

“I’m going to make some hot chocolate.” August said standing up and leaving the room.  

April came back inside leaving a trail of puddles in her wake. She claimed the other couch to start reading through some picture books. Since her and August were getting along, she had gone over to see Lucas. They bonded over his interests. Even though her reading skills weren’t the best she was willing to put in the effort to enjoy the same thing her new nephew did.  

If we weren’t on a job this would have felt like a nice cozy vacation. I went into the small kitchen to see if August needed any help.   

“What kind of creature do you think we’re dealing with?” He asked as the water started to boil.  

“I’m not sure. The email said this cabin belonged to a horror writer who disappeared. That mystery became a little bit popular online to the point where some people started to stay there without notifying the rangers who look after the mountain. For certain they know a couple disappeared after staying here but they’re not sure how many others might have shared the same fate.” I told him frowning.  

At a glance, there were no signs of a violent attack. No claw marks, no blood stains. Nothing. Without more clues, we wouldn’t be able to figure out what was targeting people on the mountain.  

“The rangers mentioned they saw a person with a beautiful face in the middle of a snowstorm. They weren’t able to find them again and weren’t entirely certain they were real.” I mentioned.  

August nodded thinking through all the creatures he was aware of. There were simply too many of them to narrow it down. I flexed my right arm to let it transform into a claw. The air around here was thick with magic so it was easy to keep it in the other form. I needed to get used to it like this so I carefully picked up a hot mug with the claw to take it out to Evie. August brought one to April and I had one of my own.  

“Thanks Augu-” Evie started to say when she accepted the mug half paying attention to who was standing in front of her.  

When she saw the claw she looked between it and my face. Carefully she set the mug down next to the couch and stood up hands on her hips looking like a displeased mother.  

“Dude, what the fuck?” She sternly said.  

I’d forgotten I hadn’t told her about the new arm.  

“Oh. My arm got blown off. I got a new one. No big deal.” I shrugged.  

She looked horrified. Didn’t she work with a lot of supernatural creatures? Isn’t something like this normal in our line of work?   

“Blown off? That is a bit of a deal. Did you get all these new scars when you lost your arm?” She pressed very worried about what I went through while she hadn’t been around.  

“The one under my eye yes. The one on my neck was on a different job. This stuff happens. All Contract Workers have scars. Most Agents do too.” I defended myself.  

“I don’t.” April said smugly.   

“If you’re brushing off something like your arm being blown away then I hate to think about what else has happened to you.” Evie said and tightened her pullover around her as if she had suddenly gotten a chill.  

“Well... My left arm is perfectly fine.” I pointed out trying to make her feel better.  

“Wasn’t that the one Joey shot?” August said and it didn’t help my case.  

“Did you only get chomped on that one time or did you hurt your arm back then too?” April chimed in.   

I couldn’t remember what else happened to me when Moss had nearly bitten my body in half. That overshadowed any other injuries I’d gotten that day.   

“Jesus. No wonder you look so terrible.” Evie said and brushed some hair out of my face.  

It was nice to have such caring friends even though they were currently ganging up on me.  

“I was born ugly. At least I’ve been showering so I don’t smell on top horrible looks.” I half-joked.   

I bet if I finally cut my hair and got some sleep people would stop saying how bad I appeared. April snuck up behind me hand slightly raised.  

“You need to shower more because you slightly smell rotten right here!” To make her point very clear she slapped my back very close to my behind.  

A burst of pain blinded my vision. I knew she was trying to be funny by pretending to slap my butt. She hit the bad side and I was forced to double over for a few seconds clutching my leg until I could finally breathe. April stood staring at her hand shocked over how such a small amount of effort knocked me over.  

“Sorry. Bad leg.” I told them.  

“Dude.” Evie said and got her point across with a single word.   

None of them were impressed by my broken body. No matter how many impressive traits I gained from my bloodline, I was still human. It was a miracle that I lived this long so overall I didn’t mind all the new scars.  

“If we’re done bothering Richie then I would like to talk about this job.” August brought up.  

We all turned our attention toward him almost forgetting the reason why we were there.  

“I wanted to start looking around the mountain tonight but it would be best to stay inside until the weather gets better.”  

The wind picked up since I arrived. Large snowflakes came down making the night appear lighter. Even if we had the proper gear to stay warm outside, we couldn’t risk getting jumped by some sort of creature in this storm.  

We agreed to stay inside for the night and would wait until morning or when the snow cleared up. One of the couches pulled out into a bed large enough for two people. By the time we’d gotten settled for the night April had already passed out curled up on the floor by the fire. August lifted her to get her tucked in on the other couch as if he’d done the same actions a hundred times before.   

I offered to sleep in the only bedroom but August wanted us to stay all in the same room. He was fine staying awake all night. Somehow Evie talked me into sleeping next to her trusting I wouldn't try anything. Even if I did, August would put a quick stop to it.   

A mixture of exhaustion and the smell of a warm fire put me to sleep a few minutes after getting comfortable. It was rare for me to drift off so quickly. And even rarer for me to dream.   

I opened my eyes to find myself standing inside an old worn-down house I thought I’d forgotten about. It was the last place I lived with my mother. A musty smell clung to every surface and a large front window let in far too much light sun bleaching most of the furniture. Despite its faults, it had almost been a home.  

I’d walked down the long dirt driveway and then realized I had forgotten my cell phone. It was ringing away on the table next to the door by the time I went back inside the house. Utter dread sank into my stomach hearing that noise. The ringing became louder until it overtook the rest of my senses. My body refused to move. If I picked up that phone, I would hear the last conversation I ever had with my mother.  

My heart beat so hard it hurt. My throat tightened up at the horrible realization that I had no memory of her last words. How could I forget such an important thing? My legs wanted to run. To not face such a hard truth. I hated myself for not remembering and yet I was too afraid to pick up that phone.  

A different sound came through the ringing. A voice. Someone calling for help. I used every ounce of willpower to ignore my feelings and move my feet to save someone who needed it.  

My eyes opened and I was on the fold-out bed next to Evie. My heart still raced and I quickly realized that every muscle was frozen. I could glance to my side and that was it.   

My stomach sank to the floor at what I saw. Evie was fighting someone who sat on her chest and had their hands around her throat. It looked like August but his expression wasn’t quite right. She was crying, begging for him to let her go as sharp nails dug into her skin. No matter how much I struggled I couldn’t even call out for her.  

“You’re not fooling anyone with this pretty face. Let’s show everyone how ugly you really are.” He spoke in an almost distant voice.   

His clawed fingers slid under her skin and started to pull. Evie froze her voice cracking as her face started to be lifted off with sickening noises. If this kept up, she would die of shock. I bite down on my tongue hard, the pain shocking my system enough to get out a yell.  

“Wake up!”  

I sprang upward, my vision spinning and lightheaded from breathing so hard. Looking over I saw August holding Evie’s wrists as she sat up on the fold-out bed sobbing. Bloody scratch marks were over her neck and her fingernails were stained at the tips.  

“Sorry, I might have hurt you.” August said and let go of her arms.  

Her wrists appeared to already be bruising but it was better than her clawing out her throat. I also had some minor scratches. I dreaded to think about how easily I could have killed myself if my arm turned into a claw while I was asleep to scratch at my neck like Evie had.  

Without warning she threw herself on August crying so hard she couldn't speak for a minute.  

“I'm sorry!” She sobbed out.  

Neither of us knew what she was apologizing for.  

“No matter how hard I try, I still hurt you and April! I’m no better than my cousin Jessie. I wish my family never had this stupid power.”  

I realized that I hadn’t talked to Evie about what her cousin did to Moss and his family members. I was too caught up in my own issues to think about how much that would affect her. August carefully wrapped his arms around her shoulders as she cried against his chest and rested his cheek against the top of her head.  

“You have been a good friend to April. I’m glad we ended up with you.” He assured her.  

She shook her head but didn’t raise it.  

“It’s still slavery.” She sniffled.  

This had clearly been eating away at her for a while. Her family did have control over a lot of supernatural creatures forcing them into dangerous work. Some of them abused that power but overall, the system kept creatures from being passed around to even worse owners.  

“And it’s my choice to forgive you for it. You did your best within the system you found yourself in. You can’t collar me again and April has always seen you as a friend instead of an owner. We did have some issues getting along but that's just an older brother’s job to tease his little sister.”  

August didn’t hold a grudge against Evie. He might not like certain family members of hers but he probably instantly saw her as a sibling. Not just because he was missing April until she warmed back up to him. He just thought Evie was a good person. He let her settle down for a minute or so until she finally pulled away. Her face was a mess from crying so hard.  

“I look so bad.” She complained rubbing her eyes.  

“Some people say beauty comes from the inside and if that’s the case you’re the prettiest girl I know.” I told her fully aware of how lame it sounded.  

A small smile came to her face unable to brush off the comment.  

“Damn straight.” She whispered to herself.  

“With that settled we should figure out what caused you two to start clawing at your necks in your sleep.” August said standing up.  

I glanced around the room looking for any signs of something strange. The magic flow was weak but ran under the cabin in a dotted line. I looked outside trying to follow the stream of light and realized it didn’t go beyond the cabin. I crawled off the bed and onto the floor. Using my right clawed hand, I got some sharp fingers between the floorboard to rip one away from the rest. Evie used her phone to shine a light down into the dark space cringing at what she saw. A bundle of dark red mushrooms grew from the wood. They gave off a slight magic glow to my eyes so I could tell they infested the entire cabin floor.   

August reached over to pluck one from the bundle and ate it. We stared at him wondering if that was safe.  

“It’s still juicy. It seems like these are the cause of the disappearances.” He commented nodding his head.  

“What are they?” I asked him.  

Magic plant life was not my strong suit. He lived in the mountains so might have come across something like this before.  

“They had a few different names. Some call them Baku mushrooms or vampire shrooms. They sprout under beds and give off spores that put people to sleep. Then they give them nightmares that cause them to roll out of bed, ripping open their necks. The mushrooms absorb the blood and can go a very long time between meals.” He explained.  

That made sense. The writer who lived here might have used them as inspiration. As long as he kept himself tied down, he could use his nightmares as part of his work. But he must have broken through the bindings or lost his mind from repeated use.  

August was immune to infections and spored like these. So, he wasn’t put to sleep like the rest of us.  

“If they only feed on the blood, what happened to the bodies?” I pointed out. Finally drew attention to something else very important. “And where is April?”  

August glanced at where she had been on the other couch but didn’t appear alarmed.  

“She got up and said she was going to the washroom.” He said.  

“Has she ever sleptwalked when she was younger?”  

Now he was alarmed. He rushed to the bathroom finding it empty. Then searched the entire cabin for her within a few minutes. I threw on my now-dry jacket and gloves. Evie was far too stressed to come with us.  We didn’t want to leave her alone in the cabin so she agreed to leave. A hug and a promise later she was through a doorway back somewhere warm and safe.  

I followed August outside in the ankle-deep snow ready to search the entire mountain for April. The wind had mostly covered any track but we found a short trail to lead us in the right direction.   

“Can you see anything?” August asked.  

The wind was still blowing the cold made my eyes water. It was bright enough to see but I didn’t notice April's magic anywhere nearby. I shook my head which made August move faster. I called after him to wait so we could talk and try to figure out a plan.  

“Should we call for more help?” I offered.  

“We can try but they won’t spare anyone looking for a collared creature like April.” he explained.  

I bet Evie was already putting in requests for assistance. However, unless she was offering to pay most wouldn’t spare the time. I was starting to fear we would need to search the entire mountain on our own.  

I sensed something at my back and moved in time. An object flew past my head and embedded itself inside a tree. I glanced at it and then turned around to face more of the odd shapes. I’ve never seen something like this before. A pale human arm was encased on a sharp tendril of clear ice reaching up from the snow. Another tendril rose with a leg in the middle, the ice sharpened to a point. Power came from the frozen body parts controlling the ice, shifting it into a dangerous weapon.   

The leg launched forward trying to impale August. He moved out of the way only to narrowly avoid another attack from behind. Soon we were being targeted by six icy blades. Three were arms which meant at least two people had been taken apart to create this horrifying situation. We were already outnumbered and I feared even more dangerous tendrils would appear soon.  

August lashed out with hard claws shattering the ice to pieces. It reformed in seconds which made my stomach drop. I followed his lead smashing so many of the threats away only to have them come right back. From what I could see they were feeding on the magic of the mountain. If that was the case they had a nearly unlimited supply.   

I raised my right arm in time to block a pillar of ice from sinking into my tender flesh. I heard August shout something. The ice started to glow. I shut my eyes; the light grew to the point it burned. My right arm was still holding away the ice. I lifted my left hand to cover my eyes trying to block out the light. When it faded and I opened my eyes again I realized I’d been blinded on the right side. An attack came that I mostly dodged. The rough cold surface scratched across my forehead forcing me to step back.  

I was too focused on not getting killed I didn’t hear what August said. He started running in my direction and then got knocked aside. My foot slipped as I was backing up, the snow and the ground fell out beneath me. I had been guided off a sharp drop I hadn’t seen. My hands uselessly grasped at the air trying to find anything to stop my fall. On the way down my good leg hit against the slope twisting my ankle. The fall wasn’t high enough to kill me.  

I ended up buried in snow, half blind with pain coming from my leg. Gasping for air I started to dig trying to get free. It was too dark to figure out which way was up and my fingers were starting to go numb. Panic rose to my throat. Would I die here? Suffocated in the snow while my friends get chopped up into small pieces?  

I needed to stop and calm down. With some effort, I slowed my breathing. Looking for traces of magic strained my good eye. I could only do it for a few seconds. A shape was above me. The flow looked familiar. I reached out and had a hand take mine. They easily pulled my body from the snowy grave. I inhaled cool fresh air coughing hard from the harsh temperature.   

I expected to see August. Instead, a different person stood fidgeting with their hands worried about my condition. He was taller than me and bundled up with layers of dyed fabrics. He carried a large bag on his back and had a small bow at his hup. His face was covered by a sheet of fabric that swayed in the breeze. I didn’t sense any hostility from him. 

“Have you seen anyone else around?” I asked looking up and trying to find August.  

“No. You’re bleeding. We should get you out of the cold.” He offered and he sounded familiar.  

“I need to find-”  

My words were cut off by a rumbling at my feet. The snow exploded around us as a beast made of ice and fused body parts emerged. It had countless mouths and teeth ready to devour us. It was using animal parts as well as humans. Smaller creatures made of ice with animal limbs crawled out teeth gnashing looking for fresh blood.   

The stranger looked like he wanted to run. That would be the best idea but I couldn’t. My ankle was barely supporting my weight standing. I turned and faced the creatures, tense with my body trembling from cold and fear. Maybe I could stall long enough for Evie to get us help or August to arrive.   

Maybe.
