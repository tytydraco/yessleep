At the very least - I think someone tried to do something bad to me on the interstate in the middle of the night, in the late summer of 2018. I still remember it vividly. It has haunted me for the last 6.5 years and I’m not sure if I’ll ever know exactly what might have happened if I was alone.

To preface - I live in the US. I was 20F, my boyfriend was 21M. I lived in NWPA and my boyfriend (now fiancé) was living in Cleveland, Ohio for an internship that summer. I was not yet of the legal drinking age, but he was, and we spent the night out in NWPA (where we are both originally from). He was drinking, I was not. I was our DD. We left the bar around 1am and I started the 2-hour drive home. He was not feeling well after drinking, and obviously being in the car for an extended period of time directly after. He decided around 45 minutes into our drive to lay the passenger seat down and try to rest.

I was driving within the speed limit (maybe admittedly slightly above) and just listening to music. I was traveling in the right lane on a two-lane interstate. I wasn’t paying attention to much, other than driving. There were barely any other cars on the road being the middle of the night, and the drive to and from NWPA to Cleveland is fairly rural in most parts. Lots of flat farmland and wooded areas.

About an hour and a half in, almost to our destination, I merge left to pass a car that is driving under the speed limit in front of me. I stayed in the left lane at that point. A few moments later, (I’m not sure if it was the same car because I was not paying attention to what kind of car I passed, but I can only assume) a car came speeding up right behind me in the left lane with its high-beams on, tailing me barely feet away. 

I am not an expert on cars. I barely have a base knowledge of types of passenger vehicles to be honest. From what I remember (over half a decade later) - it was an older-model car, maybe 1990s or early 2000s. Not super well taken care of, but it had a very distinct look to the front. For the longest time, I wanted to say it was a Pontiac Grand Prix, but nothing I’ve found as far as images look like what I remember. Very small in size, steep windshield/dash, odd front lights, tinted windows, and a dark color, maybe navy blue or black.

Obviously annoyed, thinking it’s just someone with a superiority complex and road rage, I merge to the right to let them over. My fiancé is not asleep, just lying down, so I make a comment to him about crazy drivers while I’m merging. The car that was tailing me continues to tail me and merge into the right lane, again right behind me. I merge back over again into the left lane. They follow me. Back into the right lane. They follow me. Keeping the same distance with their high beams on.

At this point, my fiance tells me to pull over because there may be something wrong with the car (obviously not a smart idea). I pull onto the pull-off section of the interstate immediately off the right lane. The other car also pulls over. High beams still glaring. My fiancé quickly lifts his seat up while simultaneously opening the car door and steps out of the passenger side. At that instant, the driver of the other car literally skidded out from behind me and sped away. Nothing was wrong with our car. All the lights were working. He just kind of got back in and I continued the drive home, obviously terrified over what just happened. I did not get a license plate and I did not get out of the car until the driver had already sped away, so I did not see what they looked like.

My fiancé thinks the driver of the other car is the same car I had just passed minutes before it sped up to me. He was laying in the passenger seat, so to anyone else I would look like a young girl driving alone on the interstate at 2:30am. He thinks someone was hoping to take me with them, or take me in my car, or into the wooded area beside us- and unfortunately that’s the same gut feeling I had when the entire situation was unraveling.

I have tried for the last 6.5 years to find anything of significance that has happened in the area that sounds like it could be linked. I haven’t found anything even remotely similar to what happened to me, and unfortunately, I did not report it at the time (I wish I would have and I carry a lot of regret for not reporting it). I am thankful to never know what would have happened, but it still eats me up that I might have been someone’s next victim if the circumstances were just a bit different.
