when i was about 3, my parents divorced. a year or so later my mom started seeing a guy at the time, who she would later marry. he was kinda weird, he would listen to weird music and found extreme fascination in scaring the living shit out of people. 

for background information, him and my mom met at a hospital they both worked for at the time. later on they moved in together, and he wouldn’t really do much. he stayed clear of my way for the first year or two, and was pretty kind to my family. although he did have something (we still don’t know to this day) against my older sister. sometimes he would get very paranoid though, and start burning sage all over the house, i would find little piles of salt in corners of rooms in my house and occasionally i would walk in on him doing some weird shit. burning red candles around him, with the string smell of sage, and smoking we’d and drinking. i never really thought much of it, it was just something he did. this stuff would go on for a while, before my mom divorced him and he moved out. he was a half decent person to me at least, he always said weird shit like “if anything ever happens then i’ll protect you i promise.” 

we stayed living in that house for a short amount of time after he got kicked out, and that’s when the stuff starts happening. i started getting weird dreams, and i mean weird. for the ripe age of 8, i’d say it’s quite unusual what i was experiencing considering how sheltered i was at that age. the first dream was me standing in front of my house, staring across the street when something comes out of the bushes, with completely white eyes, blankly staring as black veins start forming across their face. i couldn’t move. i just stared until my heart rate grew so high i woke up in a cold sweat. i ran into my moms room and she told me it’s fine and to go back to my room and go to sleep. 

the second dream was less of a dream, and in all honesty, i don’t even know what to call it. i was awake, fully conscious, it was story that night and i just started drifting off to sleep when i was startled awake by thunder booming so loud my walls shook and my window rattled. lightning flashed in my eyes and i began to panic. i was going to get out of bed, to do the usual routine of running to my moms room for comfort, when i looked down of the edge of my bed, i was startled by the blood chilling sight of a random person or something, with completely black eyes. keep in mind i had never even heard of this stuff, let alone see it. i don’t really remember what happened from there but i do remember screaming and running into my moms room. she got scared and jumped, as i shoved myself under her covers and cried my little heart out. she asked what happened but i couldn’t even form words at that point. 

the third experience was not as scary at the time, just confusing. looking back now, i’m terrified. i would occasionally stare out of the door of my room and my hall light would be left on, by my request because i hated the dark. i would see hands reaching into my room coming from the hall. just hands, no body or anything. there would be more and more until my doorway was just an array of hands, completely blacked out hands. i would usually just ignore it and try to sleep. this would happen a lot, only in that room though. nowhere else. 

the final experience which scared the living shit out of me, and my mom once i told her, started like this. i was laying in bed, just trying to sleep, when i finally drifted off it was like i blinked and it was suddenly 3 or 4 am. i got up to go to the bathroom when i looked in my bathroom from down the hall, and i saw three completely blacked out dark figures. i was scared, but i was about to piss myself so i didn’t care. some part of me believed it was just my mom, getting ready, but seconds later i realized it wasn’t, as one of the figures fell backwards into my bathtub, nearly ripping the curtain down, i looked in the bathtub and all around and there wasn’t anyone there. i panicked and ran into my moms room and and slept the rest of the night in there. she never really knew why i would do this, because i was too scared to talk about it.  

a couple years later, we were on vacation when this topic somehow got brought up. i told her everything that happened and she turned white as a ghost. she turned to me and started telling me that she would experience scary ass shit like that too, and talked to me about a specific experience that convinced her to go see a medium. 

she was with my dog, sitting in her bed, the bed that i would sleep in when i got all scared, me and my sister weren’t home, and she was pregnant with my younger sister. she said she heard scratching on the window, we had rodents all around that house so she just assumed it was a rat or possum or something outside. her fear only grew as the scratching noise traveled to under the house (our house was on a raised foundation and the entrance into the under part of our house was in her closet on the floor, it was about 3 feet off the ground) coming from her closet. my dog started going insane and barking, so my mom knew that it wasn’t just her who was hearing it. she was going to leave and go to my grandmas house to stay the night, but before she could even get out of bed, the scratching noise quickly traveled from her closet to her bed, which started ferociously shaking and thumping, she called my grandma who picked her up, and my mom only went back to the house when me and my older sister came back. later on we moved out, and my mom kept a bunch of furniture and stuff in a storage unit she rented out while we lived with my grandma for a short period of time until my mom would afford to rent out a different house. 

once we moved into that house, i got my own room, and a nice bed, which was the exact bed that my mom was on when it started shaking, and within about 4 months of moving in, i was laying in my bed and just trying to get to sleep before school, when i heard a loud exhale behind me. i was too scared to open my eyes, then i heard scratching at the foot of the bed frame. i started hearing thumping and i ran into my moms room, balling my eyes out. 

me and her were just sitting there, terrified. need less to say, i no longer have that bed frame in my house.
