I need you all to at least try to believe me, as crazy as this sounds. I am making this as a call for help, because I really don't know what to do. Yes, I called the exterminator, he came and sprayed, but I swear to God it's like they migrated after I called them. They have been getting more organized, moving in patterns and taking things that aren't food.  

It all started about two weeks ago, I just gotten back from a vacation with my buddies to go see some museums in the town over (and town after that). Living in Louisiana, there's plenty of culture of history here, so we were gone for a few days. After we got back, all hung out at one of their houses for a while, I headed back to my own. Thats when I saw it: the ant hill, in my perfect, green yard. Now, I'm not one of those yard nuts that takes a tape measurer to his grass to make sure it's all perfect length, but I do care quite a decent bit. It pained my heart a little to see this, but I'm sure I can get an exterminator here in a few days to take care of it. When I called, they said it would have to be on Tuesday since its Thursday, Friday is full, and they don't do weekends, which I completely understand and pay with my card in advance over the phone to reserve my slot for Tuesday.  

The next morning, while I was making my coffee and morning usual of buttered toast with jam, I decided to stare out the window and see how my little burdens are doing. There they were, little disgusting freaks, I really really hate bugs. But ants? Oh man, I DESPISE ants like no other. When I was a kid, at the public park in my parent's neighborhood, one of the local older kids that is just a public nuisance pushed me off bike and into a pile of fire ants. Since then, I've despised ants, so I'm going to be overjoyed to watch the exterminator do their work. I saw the little bastards, crawling in a single file line down my concrete walkway. I decided I would give them a small piece of my jam toast, to give them a few days of bliss before their ultimate demise.  I crack open my front door and toss out a small piece pf the toast onto the walkway, then close my door back and sprint back to the kitchen sink window to watch. They scurried down the walkway, still in the single file line, and grabbed the bit of toast. I watched them all walk their way back to the anthill, I felt myself shiver at the thought of how many of them could live underground. The exterminator couldn't come soon enough.  

Later that day, I closed my laptop after clocking out of work, and decided it was about prime time to tend to my vegetable garden. I mentioned it earlier, but I live in Louisiana which is the perfect atmosphere to garden tomatoes and broccoli. I put on my gardening clothes, boots and all, and started making my way to the gardening shed. I could see a line of ants, crawling along side my fence, and that's when something caught my eye: near the front of their single file line, a group of them were carrying one of my little wooden garden stakes. I start walking my way over to them, but by the time I caught up, the ants along with my garden stake were already on the ant pile, and I am NOT getting close to that monolith to these devil bugs. Now, as far as I know, ants don't usually just take things that aren't food, especially wooden stakes.  

The next day, I started my morning routine per usual, and decided to check on my little ant friends. They seem to not pay me any mind, and they even took one of my stakes, which is kind of cool. I've done some thinking on it, and ants could help keep my garden safe from other insects, so maybe calling the exterminator wasn't the best idea. I sleepily stumbled over to look out my kitchen sink window, and that's when i saw what made me make this post: a small shimmer of something metallic being sucked into the ant pile by the horde. The top of it looked familiar from what i could see and that's when it hit me: that was my spare key that I keep in a fake rock in my garden. Ants don't take keys. What use would they have for them? Their larvae can't use it as a place to hide from predators, and it they had to go out of their way to get to my spare key. How the hell did they even get into the fake rock? These single file lines, looking back on it, are way to straight and perfect for ants. My heads spinning and my brain hurts trying to figure out a rational solution to this, I'm going to clock in to work and keep you guys updated when I can. Please, give me a rational explanation.
