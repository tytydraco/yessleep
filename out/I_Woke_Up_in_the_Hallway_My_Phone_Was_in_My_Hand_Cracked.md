I had just come home from the office. It was late—**1:36 AM** to be exact. I’d already had dinner with colleagues, so I wasn’t hungry. Just exhausted.

I live alone in a **third-floor apartment.** Nothing fancy. Just a place to sleep, shower, and kill time before work starts again.

As soon as I locked the door and tossed my keys on the counter, **I felt it.**

The silence.

Not the peaceful kind. The kind that’s **too heavy.** The kind where you suddenly **become aware** of the smallest sounds. The ticking clock. The refrigerator’s hum. My own breathing.

Then, my phone vibrated.

**1 New Message.**

**Unknown Number:** *"Hey. Don’t scream."*

I frowned. A prank? A wrong number? I almost ignored it.

Another text.

**Unknown Number:** *"Put your phone down slowly. And don’t turn around."*

I stopped breathing.

Behind me, the hallway to my bedroom was **pitch black.** I didn’t move. I didn’t even blink.

I typed back, my fingers shaking. **“Who is this?”**

**Delivered.** No response.

Then, my phone **vibrated again.**

**Unknown Number:** *"You have* ***10 seconds*** *before he moves. Walk to the kitchen. Now."*

I couldn’t help it. My eyes **darted toward the darkness.** And for a split second—

I thought I saw something shift.

Not a person. Not exactly.

Just… something.

My pulse hammered in my ears. I didn’t know why, but I **listened.**

I stepped into the kitchen, legs numb. The air was thick, pressing against my chest like I was **drowning in it.** My apartment suddenly felt **wrong.**

**Another text.**

**Unknown Number:** *"Good. He didn’t see you move. Now, open the fridge. Make it look normal."*

I hesitated. My fingers curled around the fridge handle. My phone vibrated again.

**Unknown Number:** *"DO IT. Now."*

I yanked it open. The white light **flooded the dim kitchen.** My heart pounded as I scanned the shelves—**nothing was there** except leftovers and some beer.

I grabbed my phone, sweat slick on my fingers. **"What the hell is happening?"**

A pause. Three dots appeared.

Then—

**Unknown Number:** *"I found your phone outside your apartment."*

**My stomach dropped.**

**Unknown Number:** *"The problem is… you’re still inside."*

My ears started ringing. My hands were trembling so hard, I nearly dropped the phone.

Another message.

**Unknown Number:** *"There was a man standing by your door when I found this. I thought he was leaving. But he’s not. He’s still there. Listening."*

I turned toward the door. **Slowly.**

My heart **clawed at my ribs** as I took one step forward. Then another. The air was suffocating now, thick with something unseen.

I pressed my **palm against the door.** It felt… warm. Like someone had been touching the other side.

I didn’t want to look.

I really, really didn’t.

But I had to.

**I leaned into the peephole.**

For a second—**nothing.**

Then—

**A bloodshot eye.**

Pressed so close, I could see **every red vein bursting through the milky white.** The iris was a sickly **yellow.** The skin around it—split open, raw, **twitching.**

And then—

It **blinked.**

Not normally. Not like a human.

**Sideways.**

I **stumbled back** so fast I crashed into the counter. My vision blurred. My heart slammed against my ribs. My body went **numb.**

Then—

**Tap.**

**Tap.**

**Tap.**

Slow, deliberate. Knuckles rapping against the wood.

Then a voice—**low, wet, and wrong.**

*"I know you’re awake now."*

The doorknob **twisted.**

Not a full turn. Just… **testing.**

I wanted to run. Move. But my body **refused to listen.**

Then—

My phone vibrated.

The buzzing **echoed** in the silence. I barely managed to look at the screen.

**Unknown Number:** *"Don’t run. Don’t scream. Whatever you do—don’t look up."*

I stopped breathing.

**Don’t look up?**

I wasn’t looking up. I was staring at my phone. But the moment I read those words; my brain started whispering:

*"What’s above you?"*

I didn’t want to know.

I really, really didn’t.

Then—

**Something dripped onto my cheek.**

Warm. Sticky. Thick.

I swallowed. My throat was dry. I forced myself not to move.

Another text.

**Unknown Number:** *"You looked, didn’t you?"*

**My blood turned to ice.**

Because I had.

And now—

It was **too late.**

The ceiling **shifted.**

Not like a crack or a creak—**like something crawling.** Something unfolding, stretching, **dripping.** My breath caught in my throat. I wanted to scream—

But the sound wouldn’t come out.

Then—

Everything **went black.**

Not the lights. Not my vision.

Something **covered my face.**

Cold, damp fingers **pressed against my eyes, forcing them shut.**

I **struggled.** Clawed at my own skin. **But the weight—it pressed down harder.**

I don’t know how long I was like that. Seconds? Minutes?

Then, suddenly—**I could see again.**

I was lying in the hallway.

The hard surface beneath me sent sharp, aching pain through my spine. My arms felt sore. My legs stiff. As if I had been lying there for hours.

Still holding my phone tightly in my hand, which had a small crack on the screen.

The time read **7:00 AM.**

But this isn’t over. **Not even close.**

Because the moment I sat up—

**My door creaked.**

Not from the wind.

Not from me moving.

From the **inside.**

**Something left.**

I ran. I didn’t stop to check the apartment, didn’t stop to grab anything—just **ran** straight to my car.

And now… I’m in my office, writing this.

I haven’t been back since. My keys, my laptop, my clothes—**my entire life** is still in that apartment.

And I know that if I go back…

**It’ll be waiting.**

So, tell me—

**What the hell should I do?**
