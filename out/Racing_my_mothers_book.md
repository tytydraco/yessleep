I can type seventy-two words per minute on a QWERTY keyboard, that is pretty fast. Still not fast enough to outpace my mother. The reason I’m losing the race is not her typing speed. She is careful, strategic and emotional (I know emotion and strategy doesn’t resonate). She knows all the cracks in my facade. A single sentence of hers is roughly a paragraph for me. Now imagine she writes multiple pages a day. I would need to employ multiple writers just to catch up to her! I’m not talking about outpacing her in words here. I'm talking about bracing for impact…

What is she doing? I’m supposed to get her book once she passes away, I just know she will get it to me somehow. I expect that it will be a last rebuke at me which will haunt me till the day I pass away. After she passes: It's to be the reason I drink every moment I can think straight. It's to be the reason I stay up all night thinking in bed and my partner asks me what's on my mind. It's to be the reason I have to take days off at work because I’m not “feeling well”. The contents of the book, I have no idea, just a son's hunch. So how do I outpace her writing: donate to women's shelters, treat my partner with all the care I can, support women at work ..  but I know it's not enough. I need to form a bunker of good deeds before her bomb of a book explodes over me.

My father cheated on her. Happens to a lot of women unfortunately. She took it hard. She did her own investigation, bugged his phone, tailed his car and caught him in the act. He was having a 2nd Thanksgiving and everyone in the family was in on it. They chased her out of the house. No-good-for-anything uncle shouting the worst of the obscenities at her as if she had committed the terrible act.

I had to pick sides and choose my father out of fear. A boy doesn't become a man until his father dies. That's when the book started. First it was a small itch behind my ear. A couple of weeks later, I could feel the pen carving inside my ear. I stopped loving my father. Yet the pen continued inching into my head. Slowly hair became skin and skin became blood and blood became bone. I was afraid, I could touch the folds of my brain. I knew I can’t let the past kill me. So I went on the counter-offensive. I have to re-enforce the dam before she can penetrate her spear like pen through the cracks of my defenses.

“He was always emotionless and couldn’t say I love you”

“He never hugged me, even on my birthday”

“He was self centered, even his friends didn’t like him”

“He wasn’t present when my mother and brother died. They loved him very much”

I added miles between us - I went to the east coast. Cut all communication and blocked her and my relatives. Dedicated my time to my career and my partner. Yet I felt the pen slowly coming back to scratch my head. At work - at the train - while sleeping, blood on my pillow. Harder this time than ever. I went to work with a beanie all summer to hide the scratches on my head. Never visited the barber to avoid answering questions. Did everything I could to outpace her writing. Thousands of dollars in donations, noting down what I was grateful for in life, helping people in need through outreach programs…

John, a long time friend, had lost most of his hair and was wearing a goatee. He had traded his health for his career as an engineer many years ago. Living well off now in DC, had come down for a conference, he was excited to hear about my life after many years. I told him about my career, partner and the slight eczema I was having on my ear and head. He offered me his condolences for my mother and I laughed. I laughed because it didn’t make sense to offer condolences for someone who was alive. More serious he got, I understood what had happened and the itching behind my ear ceased for a minute.

I checked the mailbox. There it was. A blue leather notebook with a red elastic around it. I knew a tsunami of hate and regret was about to hit me from the notebook. I had done good deeds to prepare for this moment but I wasn’t sure if it would be enough to build barriers high enough to hold the waves.

I released the elastic. Hands shaking, I flipped the cover. A single sentence was written on the first page. It had formed a canyon with ink starting from the first page all the way to the last page. The sentence must have been traced millions of times to form a chisel on the paper not unlike a stone tablet with chiseled letters on it. Repeat word was:

“I WISH I COULD SEE YOU AGAIN” and my tears formed a lake where the canyon had formed.
