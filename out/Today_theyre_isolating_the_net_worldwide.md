I wrote a monster’s true name, and it came to find me. It’s only been a few years since, but they’re already cutting the internet into pieces.

I’d always loved folklore. Creepy internet stories. Old fay tales. Grim fables. There was always something fascinating about the idea that, just beneath the skin of the world around me, fantastical, sometimes horrific or unknowable, beings roamed the dark corners. But I didn’t ever, really, believe in them. Never fully. So when I called one, did one of those goofy rituals with the mirror and the switch flicking and the little cut of the thumb, I was pretty horrified when something actually showed up.

It took a few weeks for me to get used to them being around. It took a month and a half for the number of accounts that sounded a lot like my story, with a hell of a lot more unhappy endings, to become absurd in sheer volume. It took half a year for it to become clear it was an international problem, and a whole war for the world to realize solitude was better than destruction.

I didn’t speak their true name after the first few days, since I realized others would find them, too, and I was afraid the monster would hurt them just like they would hurt me. After two weeks, I realized the harm wasn’t coming. I was friends with my own haunter after two months, and by the sixth they were one of the few friends I still thought I knew and trusted fully.

The other monsters took everything. They took the name of my country. They took the name of my town. They took the name of my road. They took my favorite authors, my history. My neighbors, job, family. They even took my trust. Forced me to second guess everything I said, did, thought and saw. My safety went away, too, though that stopped mattering when everything I wanted to be safe for started withering away by the day. The whole world crumbled, and then we all built walls to hide our personal things in.

I live in a world, now, where I could flip a coin to see if I’m going to die, or worse, the next time I go outside. I’m fairly certain that the next generation will have forgotten a lot more than what my grandparents could ever even begin to fathom would be lost to their next of kin.

I live in a world where a monster I met on the web is my friend, and I don’t want them to ever leave.

They’re not pleasant to look at. Their hair is way too long, way too coarse despite how thin it is. They’ve got a face like a sick dog, and their hands are always cold. They make unpleasant noises, their voice is like a choked whisper, and if I look at them too long or touch them too much I start to hurt. Eventually, I start to peel and rot.

I’m holding their hand, right now. It feels warm to me. Their voice sounds just as good as my favorite song.

“Do you think. We were responsible for this. Too?” Their voice is more choked than normal.

“I don’t think so. I think this was going to happen no matter what.” I try to sound like I’m afraid. Sullen. I don’t know if they can see through it.

“Everyone forgot. So we remembered. They remembered.” They’re quiet for a bit. “I don’t know what. Made me. But I think I know where I am. Meant to be.”

I don’t respond. I just watch the sun start winding its way down from the sky, casting its shadow of blue and black as it calls for the moon to take its place. The observatory we’re sitting outside of, on its high hill, doesn’t seem as proud as it used to be. It’s great telescope is bared to the world, the shell protecting it cut like paper to let it cast its eye down onto a landscape that used to be my hometown.

I don’t recognize it anymore. I don’t even know who it belongs to, now. It’s like every place in the world came together and melted in on each other, twisting themselves into a broken puzzle in their confusion.

There are monsters down there. Monsters that look like people. That are people. That swapped one skin for the other. Some of them will hurt you just for the thrill of it. Some will hurt you because they want something, or because you scare them and they don’t understand you. Others will give you things. Things that matter to you, for something that matters to them.

I don’t know what they want this half-broken body for, but I want something that matters more than keeping it.

“Remember when I said I thought you were a monster?” I look my friend in the eye, and I smile.

They don’t smile back. They don’t want to go. They don’t know I’m not going to let them. “You told me to go back. To where I came from. But I couldn’t. I didn’t want to.” They pitch their voice a little, subconsciously like they always do, trying to hide their hesitation. “You apologized for it. Later. Do you. Regret it?” They hold my hand a little tighter.

The only thing I regret is leaving them. I don’t let go of their hand. Even as the last remnants of my world band together and unleash their last payloads, scattering electric fire across the sky right in front of us. All the lights, those last twinkling stars that propped up my old life, went out in blinking rows. I heard roars, screams. Crying, laughing, and a lot of noises that didn’t really make sense to me, or made far too much sense.

My friend started to fade away. Some invisible hand started picking them apart, separating the conjured from the always been and the always forgetful. I shook my head at them.

“I’m sorry. I didn’t want to leave you alone, but you’ll find someone else. There’s always more friends. But I need you to stick around to find them.” I watch beasts roam up out of the depths of the old world, curious or hungry. And I pray I’m making the right choice. I second guess when I hear the person I love the most give that ugly cry of theirs, try to grab me and hold on like there was a choice.

Everything that I was twists and breaks, and I rot into dust. But I don’t die. You don’t trade death for life. It’s not a fair trade.

The Rot, designated unfit, must not be allowed to make contact with communications systems of any kind. Audio, digital, and physical documentation must be kept from the Rot at all times. The Rot must be referred to in its vicinity by a third randomly assigned title. The Rot’s true name, especially in full, and place of origin must never be spoken of in its vicinity or documented in a way that can be misplaced or accessed.

Decoy 20xx-20xx era laptops, desktops, phones, and other devices that would, previously, allow access to an interconnected net, should be placed in dummy or abandoned outposts, facilities, and stations that outwardly appear to be of importance to official functions. Unfit designated Dogface should have proper title randomly changed weekly, and their true name and original calling ritual must remain detached from public and low level access at all times.

Investigation into the origin of the attached entity has given few results. Physical deterioration and contamination capability is observed to lower when the Rot increases in vicinity to the attached entity, across a span of hundreds of miles in a range measurable in percentage. Physical and mental recoverability of victims also increases in likelihood. Potential old era folklore citations have been marked for potential investigation in the future.

The final moments of the Rot were transmitted to information archives post-isolation, within both Society and the Outside. The ‘message’ has been deemed non-hazardous. The entity designated as Dogface is considered a high risk breach for both sides of the walls, and is to be prevented from accessing the relevant text or audio recordings.
