hello, our names are evie and maisie and a few years ago something happened that put us off leaving the house at night forever.

we had just got off school for the spring break and back then we used to smoke every so often and decided that weekend we’d start the holidays off by doing so. what would usually happen is we would usually sleep at maisie’s house (she lives in the outskirts of town so there’s many little places we could go to smoke) wait until her parents fell asleep and sneak out. 

that weekend, after her parents had fallen asleep around midnight, we had just left the house and everything seemed normal. on the way to our usual spot, we would pass the red telephone box which no one ever seemed to use. it was old looking. the paint was chipped and the phone was surrounded with spider webs and was presumed to be broken. 

we past it and everything was fine, we smoked as usual and started to take a slow walk back to maisie’s house. on the way back, we got to the telephone box and from outside we could hear it start to ring. it made us jump, and in the moment we found it funny because of how scared and high we were. but, we carried on walking. 

as we started to get further away from it, maisie’s phone started to ring. our first thought was that it was her parents who had woken up and seen we were missing. she pulled the phone out of her pocket. but it was an unrecognisable number. we wanted to answer just in case it was her parents and it was probably best to answer then make them worry. however, we answered the phone to a piercingly loud static sound coming from the other end. We hung up the phone almost instantly as we just thought it was a spam caller or something

then, my phone rang. I answered it to the same static noise that had rang maisie’s phone before. i have no idea why we did this to this day as it truly makes no sense but our first thought was the telephone box. maybe it was how high we were or the fact we had heard it ring before or maybe even just how immature we were at 14, we decided to go back to it.

we started walking back to the box slightly more weary of our surroundings. as we got closer we noticed a man standing inside of it, and as the town was quite small we knew everyone but that man unrecognisable. he had the phone to his ear and he was facing away from us typing a number into the keypad, it was my number. my phone started to blast out my usual loud ringtone and i scrambled to quickly turn it off but it was to late. he already heard. the man quickly spun round and held eye contact with us for what felt like an eternity.

his face was inhuman, his eyes where scarily wide with large rings surrounding them. he was tall, almost as tall as the box itself, which was around 6’5. when he looked at us his mouth curved up into a huge grin. he stepped out of the box and started sprinting towards us at a speed i can’t explain. we looked at eachother and then ran for our lives. we didn’t turn back. 

we eventually got back to maisie’s and locked both of the doors and ran upstairs into her parents ( forgetting that we where even high ) and explained everything, of course missing the fact we had smoked. after we had explained they looked out the window without saying anything and stared at us like we where crazy. maisie’s mum said ‘your high, aren’t you?’ we both panicked and denied it unaware of the smell we must have brought in. i think the fact we where high made her parents not believe us because they just brushed it off like it was nothing and told us to get out and go to sleep. we decided to leave it there and go to sleep getting ready face the consequences of being caught.

the next morning we woke up and i checked my phone to see a text from my mum explaining how dissapointed she was and about 50 missed calls from the same number. i showed maisie the number and her face dropped, she had gotten the same amount from the same number to. it was the number we where called on last night. the telephone box. we never walked past the telephone box again. 

sitting here a few years from then we still don’t know if what we saw was real. has anyone else seen anything like this whilst high so we can finally get closure on the experience?
