I was applying for my third job ever and I thought that it was going to be my career.

Oh boy, I couldn’t have been more wrong. 

One day I was just looking around the internet for jobs and I came across this huge jackpot. 

The job was at a plumbing company and I would be dealing with the customers. I would be the one to call them and make the offers on repairs. 

The pay was very good, around 3000€ a month, as it was only my third job. 

Quickly I wrote an application and sent it in. Then I checked the phone number of the boss there and called him right then and there. 

The phone rang, then someone picked up.

“Danny’s plumbing service. How can I help you?” I heard from the other side of the phone

“Hello, it’s Lenny Trakhovicz. I called because I saw that you had a job open. I just sent my application and wanted to call in to try to plan a meeting for us so we could get to know each other better,” I asked enthusiastically. 

“Uhmmm, alright. Wait a moment.” I heard from the other side. 

“Alright, how about next Monday at 12:00 pm. I just did a quick check on your application and it seemed like you would suit our company very well.” The man said after a minute or so.

“Yes, that would be great. I’ll see you then. Where do we meet and what’s your name?” I asked.

“I’m Trevor and we’ll meet at Danny’s plumbing service. It’s in the center of the city, just follow the signs and you’ll get there,"said Trevor.

“Alright man, I’ll try to remember those instructions, see you then.” I told him. 

Then I hung up. 

That day was friday and I had to prepare for the meeting a lil bit. 

The following weekend went by fast. I spent so much time rehearsing some lines. I had to get that job. 

Then came Monday and I was ready, I had dressed better than usually and just cut my hair. 

Just before leaving I had this feeling of something not being right. I didn’t know what it was but the feeling was there. 

I left for the interview and I found signs on the side of the road.

“Ashfield,  20 miles” 

And an arrow pointing left. 

I was pretty damn sure that the city was on the right but I ignored my thoughts and just followed the signs.

I drove a bit further and then I saw a sign that says, 
“Danny’s plumbing service, 1 mile”

Finally the place was pretty close but the town looked abandoned. There were a couple of buildings but they definitely didn’t house anyone. 

The windows were smashed, some windows were boarded, the paint was worn and there were no signs of people being here. 


Then I see this small gas station and a sign. 

“Danny’s plumbing service, Open mon-fri 8:00-16:00.” 

That was the place. To my surprise that place was in good shape, compared to the others at least. 

The house was worn, a couple of the windows were broken but the painting looked pretty fresh, but that place was empty. 

“What kind of place is this?” I thought while scratching my head. 

Anyway I had to pull over and go in there because I already agreed to this meeting. 

I got out of my car, walked to the front door and tried the handle. It was locked so I knocked. 

That’s when I noticed that there was a note on the door. 

“On business, back in an hour. Danny” 

The place was hollow, not a thing moving in sight. I tried peeking through the window and what I saw next made my skin crawl. 

There was a body of someone lying on the floor. Face down, his arms bent weirdly and blood on the floor. 

The body was swarmed with flies. 

Suddenly I heard a car approaching, fast. 

Instantly I turned around facing the car. It pulled over and from the car came out a man. 

He was probably in his 50s and a bit overweight. He had a wild beard and he looked like he didn’t take care of himself very well. He also had lost most of his teeth. 

“Hello, I’m Trevor. You must be Larry,” Trevor said.

“My name is Lenny. We talked on the phone about a possible job available,” I answered. 

All this time I kept thinking about the body of a man. Just laying on the floor, lifelessly. 

“Yes, we indeed did. Come on, let’s get inside and talk more. I think we can figure something out,” He answered me. 

“Alright.” I answered and followed him inside. 

To my surprise the body was gone. How could this be? Just a couple of minutes ago the body was there. 

“Was it a long drive?” Trevor asked me. 

“Nope, it took only about 30 minutes,” I told him

There was a small bit of silence so I decided to ask him.

“What would be my tasks if I got the job?”

“You would be waiting here for someone to call, make calls to possible clients and then sort the clients and schedules. You would arrange our stuff,” Trevor said and he grinned.

“Alright, sounds good to me. How long would the work days be?” I asked.

“You’d start at eight and finish at four in the afternoon,” Trevor told me. 

While we talked he kept grinning and taking small peeks behind me. That made me a little anxious. Was there someone else in here?

Then Trevor and I quickly went through my previous experience and personal information. After that he suggested that we do a tour of the place and I agreed.

As we walked around the place I quickly realized that this place is not what it seems. 

The place was dirty and not taken care of. There were visible stains all over the floors and walls, visible mold and dust everywhere. 

Behind the building a window was broken and patched up with a piece of wood. 

The place looked horrible and the more I looked around the more I wanted to leave that place. 

We reached a door that said, 

“Office”

“Here is your work station,” Trevor told me. 

He opened the door and the hinges were probably rusty as hell. The door squeaked open and it was pretty dark in there. 

“Go check it out. The lights can be turned on from the left,” Trevor said. 

I stepped inside and instantly a horrible smell hit my nose. It smelt like mold, something rotting and like there was some sort of leak. 

After surviving that foul stench hitting my face, I got the lights on and what I saw made my decision about working there. 

The walls were all worn, the paint was flaky and falling off. The lamps in the ceiling had fallen to the ground. Even the windows were barred and there was no light other than the one coming from that lamp. The place hadn’t been cleaned in ages and the smell made it seem like someone or something had been decomposing there. 

I did not plan on working there. My next move was to get the fuck out as fast as possible. 

I came out of there and I didn’t see Trevor. I walked around and found Trevor at the so-called break room. He was chomping down this gray and slimy stew. I almost puked but had to keep a straight face. 

“Heeyy! Uhh I think I’m not gonna take this job. I’m sorry but it’s just too far away,” I told Trevor. 

“Huh, why not? I’ll pay you more if you stay. We need you at Danny’s plumbing. Based on your resume you would make the perfect fit,” Trevor answered

I was hesitant to not help him but I kept my decision. Everytime I thought about my working space, I was horrified and wanted to just bolt.

“No thank you, I’m sorry,” I told him.

Trevor’s face started twitching and he started to look furious. He took a deep breath and said, 

“I hate to do this, but it’s your own fault.” 

He took a few steps towards me and I turned around and got the fuck out of there. I ran out of there and when I looked back, Trevor was chasing me. I couldn’t go to my car because he would’ve caught me. So I made him chase me and then I led him away from the company’s building.  

I saw him stop and vomit. He was probably exhausted, I was in pretty good shape back then. I turned around and ran past him to my car. 

“I’ll find you! You won’t get away from us!” Trevor yelled. 

Sprinting full speed got to me as well, but I made it to my car. I turned it on and reversed it. I saw Trevor from my rear-view  mirror. He kept shaking his fists, and it looked like he was yelling. His face was all red. I couldn’t stay there for long so I left and never went back. I never found out what was going on there and honestly I don’t ever want to.
