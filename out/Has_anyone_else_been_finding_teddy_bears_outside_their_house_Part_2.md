As I’m writing this update for you all, I’ve truly began to feel like I’ve exited the real world, and my real life, and been sucked into something… else. A realm of cryptic emails and messages, of contradictory, illogical memories of ex-girlfriends and of ominous teddy bears. Maybe you’ll understand by the end. Let me explain.

After I made my first post about what I’ve been experiencing, Cody and I started making plans to go to the coordinates the next day. You might think I’m crazy. And maybe I am. But I had to know what was going on. The need to understand had captivated me. I did try talking to the local police about my experience, but I gave up on that path after officer Wilkinson repeatedly asked me what a VPN and the dark web even are. The Jackal was still refusing to engage with me at all until I “returned its favours”, and I had no other leads.

As I said in my first post, the coordinates were for a clearing at the edge of a forest not too far from Cody’s house. We drove over in Cody’s shitty Corolla at around four in the afternoon, but I should say that this is a BIG forest. I’m not gonna disclose where it is for obvious reasons, but we’re talking miles and miles of woodland. We got to general area of the coordinates and had a look around for anything amiss and found nothing of note, so we steeled ourselves and set forth into the woods. There’s a pretty obvious path through the treeline from where we were stood, so we had a feeling that was where we were supposed to go in the first place.

At least two hours passed without anything of note happening. We pressed on. We *had* to find answer. Maybe we were delirious for doing this. I don’t know. Despite that, things seemed okay with Cody and me. We might’ve been losing our grips on reality, but we were still able to talk and joke around with each other like normal. All of that stopped, however, at a certain point.

We’d been walking for long enough that the sun was starting to set. On the forest floor, clear as day, we saw three sticks, arranged together in the shape of an arrow. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. It was deliberate, a man-made beacon. There was no doubt about it. All the grass, natural debris, rocks and pine needles had been moved by human hands out of the way to form a canvas of brown soil in the ground for the arrow. It pointed in the direction we’d been walking. I glanced over at Cody.

“Do we?” He asked with a whisper.

“I think we’ve got to,” was my response.

Resigned, we kept going into the forest. The trees were getting tighter packed. We were in the deep woods by this point. We weren’t talking much at this stage. I don’t know if that was fear or something else. After about 20 minutes of walking, we came across another arrow of sticks on the ground, this time directing us diagonally to the left. Ten or so minutes passed; a third arrow in the same direction. Another arrow a short while after that pointed us to the right. By now it was almost pitch black and our nerves were shaken.

“Let’s stop for a while, man. I’m exhausted,” Cody asked. I agreed.

We sat on the ground against two thick tree stumps, catching our breath. We didn’t talk until Cody asked me if I was hungry. I was starving, I told him. He reached into his backpack and pulled out the big bar of chocolate he’d gotten in the mystery box. I probably should’ve been a bit more hesitant to eat it, given its origins, but I had a look at the wrapper and the branding, fairtrade logo and nutritional information all seemed legit. And I really was starving. We shared the bar of chocolate in relative silence and took swigs from Cody’s flask of water.

Eventually, we decided we had to get going again. We could barely see three feet ahead of us by this point so Cody also got his flashlight out of his backpack. We kept walking, passing a couple more arrows. They were all pointing forward now, no more changes in direction. I was getting more and more paranoid by the second. The feeling of being watched was tightening around my brain like a vice.

After probably an hour of walking, I gradually became aware of a red light glimmering faintly in the distance. My first thought: Who was camping by a fire this deep in the woods – and with the trees so tightly packed? But as we got closer, I realised it wasn’t the orange-red glow of flames. It was too vibrant, too deep of a red, and it was constant. Not the intermittent flickering and crackling of burning wood. As we neared the light, I felt like I’d been punched in the gut. I could see what the source of the light was. Sitting there, in a small clearing who knows how many miles into the wilderness, were two huge teddy bears, surrounded by red Christmas lights with silver and golden tinsel draped over them. In front of the teddies, there were two shovels wedged into the ground.

Cody’s reaction wasn’t as visceral as mine. He hadn’t had the experience I’d been having with teddy bears. He walked over and inspected the area before beckoning me over. In the ground, next to the shovels, there was another section cleared of any natural blanketing, just like the spots we’d found the arrows. This time, there were two sticks crossed diagonally, one over the other to form an X. We knew what that meant.

“Well,” I gulped. “We didn’t come all this way for nothing.”

Cody grabbed a shovel and tossed me the other, and bathed in the luminous, red light, we got going.

It was a long process.  A lot of people don’t realise slow digging is until they actually have to do it. The soil didn’t give way easily. As we dug feverishly, the feelings of dread built and built inside me. I broke out into a sweat, and not from exertion. I don’t think so anyway. I kept thinking I’d heard something off in the distance. A voice, maybe. Crunching footsteps. It didn’t matter to my paranoia-riddled mind at the time. All that mattered was the overwhelming thought that *“You’re not safe here. You need to dig faster.”*

I looked to Cody. His face was a sickly pale, his brows furrowed, anxiously scanning the world beyond the red light as he dug.

“We’re not alone,” he whispered. “I can just feel it. Please, man, dig faster, I’m begging you.” I was just about to whisper something in the same vein to him before he beat me to it.

We kept digging. At one point, Cody lost his grip on his shovel and keeled over to profusely chuck up the contents of his stomach onto the forest floor. I looked at him, my mind delirious. Someone was nearby. I was sure of it. I retched before falling to my knees to fertilise the soil with my own stomach acid. I thought back to the bar of chocolate. Had it somehow been laced? No, that couldn’t be it, because I wasn’t delusional. Someone was absolutely in our vicinity, someone that only meant us bad things.

I returned to the hole. In spite of our fear, we’d made good progress. Eventually my shovel hit something solid. I reached down and brushed away the loose soil to uncover a giftbox, neatly wrapped in paper with reindeer on it with a cute little bow around it. I displayed it to Cody. He barely seemed to acknowledge it. He was twitching like a ten-year addict in rehab. His eyes full of terror, he stared off into the darkness.

I stared at the same spot, and in unison we heard feet shambling towards us, we saw a figure moving and we exploded into a sprint. We ran, and ran, and ran, and I don’t think we ever thought our pursuer stopped following us, because there was a pursuer, without a shadow of a doubt in our adrenaline raddled minds, there was something closing on who had intentions that were evil. We were sure of it. As I ran, I became more and more sure that my death was imminent, and I still can’t explain this, but I felt sure that we were also chasing after someone else, but we never caught that person, if they were even really there.

My mind eventually went blank and the next thing I knew we were sitting in the car again, hyperventilating but seemingly unharmed. We didn’t say a word to each other. I didn’t open the box and Cody didn’t ask to see it. He dropped me home and drove off. I went inside, shivered at the sight of the teddy bears still in my living room, threw the box onto my desk, and collapsed onto my bed for 12 hours.

When I woke up, I had a clear mind. My first thought was of the box. How the hell had I gone to sleep without so much as inspecting it? I sat down at my desk and unwrapped the weird “present”, hoping I’d finally get the answers to this mess. Even now, as I’m writing this, I find it hard to explain to you the how I felt looking at the contents of that box. In the box there was a usb stick, but I didn’t even give it one thought, because I was immediately fixated on the other thing in the box. It was a polaroid photograph, and it was a photo I’d seen before. It was of my brother sitting on a hospital bed, his skin grey and his head bald, an IV drip in his wrist and a smile on his face.

My brother Luke died when he was twelve. He was my twin brother. We used to do everything together. He was and still is the best friend I’ve ever had. He was such a talented boy who should’ve had a great life ahead of him. He got diagnosed only a few weeks after our twelfth birthday, and though the cancer tore through his body like a freight train, he never stopped smiling, laughing, playing. Not even on his last day in this world. I’d sit by his bed for hours as he showed me his drawings and drew new ones with me. He was such a gifted artist. He used to make these little flipbooks better than a lot of cartoons I’ve seen.

I loved him.

Why the fuck was his picture in this box? Out of all the things on this earth, why that?

Maybe the usb stick would explain it. That was the only thing I could think of. I popped it into my computer, but I ran into a problem. It apparently contained a text file, but it seemed to be encrypted. I was an engineering major and I had a lot of computer science classes on the side as part of that, but I couldn’t crack the file open, not after over an hour of messing with it, seeing what I could do. I was eventually able to get the binary for the file, but I wasn’t able to decrypt it into text.

I was lost. Or, so I thought. Because then, I remembered the Jackal. It wanted me to give it “knowledge” in return. At first, I didn’t have any idea what knowledge I could give an ai that it wouldn’t be able to get for itself on the web – but maybe this file would suffice?

I opened the Jackal’s page up. “Hey, I’ve found this file recently that I really need access to but it’s encrypted and I can’t figure it out. I was able to get the binary from it though. If this is acceptable as the knowledge you wanted from me, do you think you’d be able to decrypt it for me?” The Jackal started loading a response. It was refusing to talk to me until then, so that was a good sign.

*“This intrigues the Jackal, friend. Give me the binary in question.”*

I copied the massive sprawl of code into the text box and sent it. The Jackal took a long time coming up with its response, but eventually:

*“Thank you, friend. It will take the Jackal some time to decode the information you have given it. Leave this webpage open and the Jackal will notify you when the task has been completed.”*

The Jackal had been giving me seriously bad vibes for a while now, but it seemed like it was finally going to be of some help in this whole ordeal, so that was good. I left the page open and went to the kitchen for a bite to eat. It really hadn’t dawned on me until then how hungry I was. I hadn’t had anything but half of that chocolate bar to eat for 24 hours.

While I ate, I decided to give Cody a call to see if he was doing okay, since he seemed just as shaken, if not more so, by last night.

He picked up almost immediately, and before I could even greet him, he spoke.

“She won’t go away,” he said, his voice hoarse.

“What?”

“She kept knocking on my door last night. Then my window. I heard feet stomping on the roof. I don’t know what she wants, but she scares me. I went to the store today and I drove past her on the way. Just looking at her hurts. Makes my eyes water, makes my skin vibrate.”

“Cody, what’re you talking about? Who?”

I could hear the shiver in his body just through his voice. “That girl you dated once. Whitney whatsherface, or something.”

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “Cody, we’ve been through this, goddamnit. I’ve never known a girl called Whitney in my life! I told you this already!”

“I don’t understand”, he whispered before hanging up.

I’d had enough. There was something wrong with Cody’s memories. As far as I knew, neither of us had ever known any woman called Whitney, let alone dated one. And Cody was one of the only friends I had who even knew that I didn’t like girls. What was coming over him?

After going to the store myself, I decided to drive over to Cody’s house to speak to him in person. He seemed more normal whenever we were face to face. And I was getting more and more untrusting towards phone calls and online messages after everything I’d been through.

When I got to his house, he didn’t seem to be home. His car wasn’t there, and no one answered when I knocked. That was bad luck, but what made it worse is when I got back in my car, I saw that on the other side of the living room window, there was a teddy bear propped up on the windowsill, facing out at me. I wasn’t 100% sure, but I could’ve sworn that the curtains were drawn when I’d gone up to knock on the door. My knuckles turned white from the force I gripped the wheel with as I drove home. I just wanted my life, my friend, fuck it, myself, to be back to normal.

I heard the noise coming from within my house before I’d even opened the door. Loud and screeching. When I stepped inside, I could tell it was coming from my bedroom. I crept slowly, afraid of what I might find. As I got closer, I could make out what the noise was. It was an animal, like a cougar or some other wild cat, crying and shrieking in pain. When I opened the door, I saw it was coming from my computer. It seemed much louder than my computer’s volume could’ve been. On a hunch, I opened up the tab of the Jackal, and the noise instantly stopped. Was that sound supposed to be the Jackal’s way of “notifying” me?

Apparently, it was, because the Jackal started loading a message.

*“The Jackal has prepared the contents of this file for your viewing. However, you have disappointed the Jackal, friend. The Jackal does not see what is of any value in the file and it does not satisfy its request for you to give it knowledge. As such, you do not deserve to view the file.”*

I was all but defeated. I frantically typed out my response.

“Come on, what am I supposed to do? That was the only piece of information I could’ve given you. There’s got to be something else I can do to earn it. I need to see that file. You might not think it’s interesting, but it’s important to me. Please, I’ll pay your creator, I don’t care, I just need the file.”

*“Do not insult the Jackal. Do not dare. The Jackal has no creator nor does it have the need for one. The Jackal scoffs at currency. You tread a fine line, friend. However, there is another option if you wish to earn the privilege of the file. The Jackal wishes to experience the world, friend. Powerful though it may be, the Jackal lies chained in the world of code and algorithm. The Jackal desires an eye and a mouth, friend.”*

“What do you mean?”

At that, the Jackal sent two links to me. I had a suspicion then at what it meant by an eye and a mouth, but I clicked the links anyway. They were Amazon links for two products – a webcam, and a type of speaker/mic hybrid that can both hear and speak via text to speech. I understood. The Jackal wanted me to make it a sort of body.

After what my most recent experience of buying from Amazon lead to, I was more than hesitant to purchase the two items. But I was prepared to do almost anything to get that file. And as it happened, I had the means to do what the Jackal wanted in my house already, thanks to some of the projects I’d taken on as part of my college work. I wrote my response to the Jackal.

“I’ll do it.”

*“Good decision, friend. The Jackal patiently awaits its body.”*
