Look, all I can say for certain is that the thing that tried to kill me six nights ago was not a normal animal.



I remember that the night was fairly cold as I went to take out the trash. The rain was pouring, gently but consistent, and I had forgone a jacket for the sake of getting the task over with quicker. It was one of those nights where the neighbors must’ve all needed to get into work, or something, early because the only lights I could see were the streetlamps. I couldn’t make out any lights in any windows, no TV, nothing. It was also unusually quiet too. Bugs normally make noise at all hours of the night here. But I couldn’t hear a damn thing that night. I didn’t pay it any mind. I needed to get to work early the next day, like everyone else.



What I did pay mind to, however, was the inexplicable feeling of dread that I got as I walked back to my garage.



It was almost like I was being watched by something, stalked even. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I looked around and saw nothing. Nothing among the trees, nothing among the houses. I tried to chalk it up to the heebie-jeebies about the night being unusually quiet or me being particularly cold without a jacket, but I could only shake the feeling when I got back into my garage.



I let out a breath of relief as I made my way to the garage door gizmo. I went to press it and that feeling, that same creeping paranoia that had overcome me outside, came back. I tried to steel myself, tried to convince myself that the feeling would go away when the garage door closed, and pressed the button.



For some reason, this time, I felt the need to watch the door and make sure it closed. I never do that normally, but this creepy feeling was controlling me. The door was mostly closed when…it made it’s presence known.



It tried to scurry underneath, but it got stuck on the garage door. I couldn’t get a good look at it at the moment, all I saw was the mess of animal limbs as it struggled under the weight of the door. At that point, I thought it was just some poor animal that was trying to get out of the rain. The animal managed to wriggle its way into my garage, and that’s when I got a good look at it.



I’m not someone who knows the critters all that well, but whatever it was, it wasn’t any animal I’d seen before.



As it started to get its bearings and “stand up,” I saw that it was big as shit, like deer-sized, way bigger than should’ve been able to squeeze under that gap. Its front limbs were skinny, way too long for its body, and it had five long claws on two paws at the end of each. Its face had a long snout with way too many thin, needle-like teeth that were stained red. It was also missing a goddamn eye. The thing had long jet-black fur that was matted and had a bunch of fleshy scars scattered throughout. This was not any normal animal.



I was frozen. Just looking at the thing locked me in place like it was holding me with just its presence alone. No matter how much I wanted, my legs just wouldn’t move. I watched it as it shook itself dry like a dog. For a second, I thought it might’ve actually just been trying to escape the rain. The more that I looked at it, the less frightening it became. It started to seem even friendly; its sharp teeth started to look like a nice smile. Poor thing. I felt like I needed to get closer to it. It might’ve needed help or something. My body instinctively took a half-step towards it.



But then, it looked at me.



It took a couple of its own tertiary steps towards me, almost as if it were testing to see whether I’d run away. When I didn’t, its needle smile seemed to grow a little wider.



It lunged at me, all limbs and claws and gnashing teeth.



In that moment, it was like all of my senses returned. That feeling of dread wasn’t creeping anymore; it was everywhere in my body. I jumped back and into the open door to my basement, slamming it shut and locking it just as the thing landed where I was.



I pushed my body against the door as the creature started slamming against it. That thing wasn’t making any noise. All I could hear was the constant banging of its body on the door. I had options, A desk, some heavy boxes and maybe some chairs if I positioned them right, but getting any of those would mean leaving the door, and I had no idea how long it would last with that thing trying to break it down.



It slammed against the door again, harder this time. The door cracked and the force of the impact knocked me off it. I scrambled back to the door as fast as I could, but I knew it wasn’t lasting much longer. I had to make some type of choice quickly if I wanted even the slightest chance of surviving.



The option that seemed the most reasonable in the heat of the moment was, lord help me, trying to find a weapon to kill the thing.



I didn’t have much time to think because the thing slammed into the door one final time, busting it off its hinges. The door fell on top of me as I was thrown back once again.



I shoved the door off of me as the creature stalked towards me. It definitely looked like it was smiling at me. It was moving slowly, creeping towards me. I think the thing was enjoying this. All of those warring feelings came rushing back as I looked at it. The creeping dread, the pity for the creature and the desire to go closer to it. But the feeling that overcame me the most was a desperation to survive. I crawled back a few paces before I managed to get to my feet and make a break for the stairs.



A searing pain shot through my leg. I looked back and saw that the thing had got me in the calf with its claws. I couldn’t focus on that though, I had to stay alive, and I got to the stairs going as fast as I could with a wounded leg.



I hobbled up the stairs as the thing chased after me. It was still slowly stalking me, like it wasn’t in a rush. Like it was fucking with me.



Whatever fun this thing was having trying to kill me, I was going to use the extra time to my advantage. I knew that the kitchen was a little too far to get a knife, but I did have a closet with a toolkit inside, and that toolkit had a hammer.



I struggled through the hallway, dragging my slashed leg as I went. I got to the closet with the toolkit and hid inside. Maybe, just maybe, I would be able to hide from the thing in the dark until it got bored and left. It was at that moment that I realized that the thing would definitely know where I was because my leg was for sure trailing blood. I fumbled around the closet for the toolkit. Once I had it, the hammer was easy to find because it was the heaviest thing in the box.



I heard the creature finally make its way up the stairs. That’s when I started to get a new feeling. It was almost like it was licking at the back of my brain, this overwhelming sense of inevitable failure. I swear I heard a whisper, something in my head telling me, *you cannot do this, give up*. I heard the thing sniffing, likely my blood, and slowly making its way closer to the closet. For a minute, I did genuinely want to give up. Whatever was in my head was right. I was outmatched, I didn’t know what the fuck I was dealing with, and I had left it a red carpet right to me. I wanted to open the door and give myself to it so I could be eaten, or butchered, or whatever it wanted to do to me.



My hand was hovering by the doorknob when I heard its claws rap-tap-tapping against the door. That thing was right fucking outside. It would’ve been so easy to drop the hammer and let it take me, but I came to my senses at that moment.



I didn’t want to die, and I was sure as hell not going to let this thing kill me. If it did kill me, I wasn’t going down without a fight.



I gripped the hammer tighter and turned the doorknob.



I threw the door open with all the power I had, hitting the thing in the face and staggering it back a few paces. I threw myself at it, swinging the hammer and cracking it in the snout, but falling face first into its fur. The thing pushed me off with force, sending me sprawling into my living room.



I scrambled to my feet, ignoring the shooting pain in my leg. I couldn’t let a wound and some blood loss get the better of me, just like I couldn’t let this beast get the better of me. My living room was not the largest space, but it beat trying to fight that thing in a hallway.



Fighting back must’ve enraged it, because it actually let out a noise, the loudest roar I’ve ever heard in my life, and it lunged at me. I ducked under it and slipped in my own blood. Thankfully, it crashed into the wall and disoriented itself further. I got up and charged at it, bringing my hammer down on the back of its head. The thing whipped an arm back and threw me back again.



This time, it recovered quicker. It pounced on me and pinned me by my shoulder. I switched the hand I had the hammer in and brought it down onto its arm to a loud crunch sound. The thing reared back and howled in pain as I made my move.



I tackled the creature and held it down to the ground. I raised the hammer up and brought it down on its face. I brought it down again and again and again, trying to turn its skull into mush. I had to make sure this thing didn’t survive. The creature flailed and howled as I struck it.



Its good arm shot up and got me in the neck with a claw.



I fell over, clutching my throat and kicking my legs. I found some comfort, some peace in my last moments, in the fact that I knew the thing was dying right next to me.



That’s when I heard them. Sirens. I couldn’t tell what type of sirens they were, but somebody must have heard that thing screaming and called 911.



At that point, I had to laugh. It was more of a wet gurgle than a laugh, but it was all I could muster. They couldn’t have gotten here sooner?



My vision faded to black as I heard my front door being busted down.







I woke up in a hospital.



I struggled to open my eyes in this new environment. The bright lights, sterile smell and beeping machines were already overwhelming.



“My goodness!” I heard a voice say, “Doctor! Get in here! He’s awake!”



I opened my eyes more to see a nurse standing next to me.



He was a man that was maybe in his fifties, greying hair, purple scrubs, N-95 mask covering most of his face. I didn’t know how long he had been there, but he looked like he’d had a long day. The doctor that came in looked damn near identical to the nurse, except he was wearing a lab coat and no mask. They looked like they could be brothers from what I could make out.



I realized that I was all bandaged up. My leg was wrapped up, and I could barely move my neck from all the bandages on it



The doctor sat down on a stool and rolled next to me.



“I’m Dr. Harris, and that’s Nurse Jacob,” The doctor said in a warm voice, “Son, how are you feeling?”



“Like absolute crap,” I replied, “What happened to me?”



“You were out for a few days after an attack. The official police report says it was an animal.” Dr. Harris said, “They’re thinking maybe it was some type of animal with Mange, or something like that.”



“That’s bullshit!” I said, “That thing was not an animal!”



“That’s what I said when I saw the photos of it.” Nurse Jacob interjected.



“Jake,” Dr. Harris sighed, rubbing his face with a gloved hand, “Let’s not peddle the conspiracies in front of the patient please.”



“Listen Ben, you know that the whole ‘diseased animal’ thing the cops are trying to pull is only to keep the public from panicking,” Nurse Jacob argued, “Mr. Langley here needs to know that somebody believes him, so he doesn’t think he’s crazy.”



Dr. Harris sighed again and stood up.



“We’re gonna check up on you again in a few minutes, son, give you some time to wrap your head around everything.” Dr. Harris said, “But, for what it’s worth, I think the police are full of shit too.”



With that, Dr. Harris and Nurse John walked out the door to my hospital room, leaving me alone with my thoughts.



That was two days ago. Since then, I’ve spoken to the police. I feel like they’re fucking with me just like that creature did. They are trying to convince me that it was a rabid, sick bobcat or deer or something. I know that it wasn’t. The only two people who believe me are Nurse John and Dr. Harris. I think they’re the only reason why I’m not getting some type of psychological evaluations. The one nice thing the police have done for me is bring me my electronics from my place, so I’m not forced to rely on hospital TV for entertainment.



I still don’t know what that creature was or why it wanted to kill me. All I know is that it’s dead, and I know that I’m terrified of going back home now.
