My husband squeezed my hand reassuringly as the radiographer, her eyes heavy with sorrow, said she needed to consult the doctor about the results of our recent scan.

Moments later, the doctor entered the room, his expression mirroring hers. He spoke gently, but the weight of his words was unbearable. He explained that our sweet daughter wasn’t compatible with life. Then, with a sensitivity I could barely process, he presented our options: termination or carrying her to term, allowing us to donate her organs and offer a chance of life to others.

The conversation felt distant, like a storm raging just beyond a window. I placed a trembling hand on my belly, where my daughter rested beneath my heart. She kicked softly, a delicate reminder of her presence, and the pure love radiating from her tiny, unseen form overwhelmed me. How could something so perfect be so impossibly wrong?

The days that followed were unbearable. My husband and I drifted through them in silence, our words stolen by the enormity of what lay ahead. We barely looked at each other, as though meeting each other’s eyes might shatter the fragile hold we had on ourselves.

I spent hours sitting in the nursery, the room we’d lovingly prepared for her. Butterflies danced across the walls in vibrant colours, and pink blankets filled the crib that would never hold her. The cheerful details now felt like cruel mockery—a hollow dream that could never be. It was as if the room itself mourned, suffocating under the weight of what would never come to pass.

Desperate for solace, I turned to online forums, seeking comfort among strangers who shared our terrible fate. I scrolled through stories of others navigating this same dark path, their words filled with grief and shattered hopes. They spoke of impossible choices, tiny caskets, and the strange, aching numbness that came with loving someone you were destined to lose.

I was scrolling the website mindlessly when a post caught my eye: “I can save her.”

Disgust bubbled up immediately. A troll, here of all places? Making fun of grieving parents was beyond pathetic. I shook my head and kept scrolling.

But there it was again: “I can save her.”
That was strange. The site’s moderators were usually quick to delete duplicate posts. I ignored it, trying to focus on the comforting discussions, but it appeared again: “I can save her.”

Now I was furious. Where the hell were the moderators? I clenched my jaw, logged off, and put my phone aside. It was hard enough being on that website as it was, and any small comfort I’d found there had been ruined by this disgusting intrusion.

As I chopped vegetables for dinner, my phone pinged. The screen lit up with a message from an unknown number: “I can save her.”
My hands froze. What the hell? I stared at the message, my mind racing. Who could’ve sent this? We hadn’t told anyone—not even our families.

I sat down, my phone clutched tightly in my hand, trying to piece it together. Someone must have recognized my username from the forums, I reasoned, but how did they get my number?
Then another message arrived: “I can save her. One life for another.”

A shiver ran down my spine. My anger had drained away, leaving only unease—and something else, something I couldn’t admit even to myself. Hope. What if this wasn’t a prank? What if it meant something?

After dinner, I logged back onto my computer, unable to shake the words from my mind. I searched frantically: “I can save her.” Then: “One life for another.”

For hours, I scoured obscure forums, dead-end threads, and cryptic sites that made no sense. I was about to give up when I finally stumbled upon what I’d been looking for.

The website was simple, its text chillingly direct:
"Once you’ve been called, you have 24 hours to act. One life must be taken to save another. You must be the one to kill them."

I sat silently in my chair, staring at the screen. This had to be real—how else could I explain it?
My thoughts began to spiral. Who could I physically kill? My first instinct was to give my own life for hers—I’d do it without hesitation. But that wouldn’t work. She’s still inside me; she needs me to protect her, to bring her into this world.

I thought about my husband. Surely, he’d feel the same as I do, willing to give his life for our baby girl. But what if he didn’t? What if he resisted? He’s stronger than me—he could overpower me, maybe even hurt her in the process. That was a risk I couldn’t take.

My mind raced with alternatives. Did the sacrifice have to be human? Could I offer Jack, our cat? But the website’s chilling words echoed in my mind: “One life for another.” No, it had to be human.

Lost in thought, I barely noticed the soft knock at the door. I turned to see my four-year-old son standing in the doorway, his small frame silhouetted by the hallway light.

“Mummy, are you going to give me a bath tonight?” he asked, his voice gentle and sweet.
I smiled, forcing the tension from my face. “Of course I am, baby. Go get ready, and I’ll call you in.”

He beamed and scampered off to his bedroom to undress. As I turned to run the bath, a thought crept into my mind, unbidden and unstoppable. A strange calm settled over me, and a smile tugged at my lips.

“I can save her.”
