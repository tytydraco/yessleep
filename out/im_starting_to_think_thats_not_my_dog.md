  i know it sounds crazy, but also, i know this sub is full of people more educated than me on this. i need help, i genuinely think i might be going insane here. 

  i saw a tiktok a few days ago, i know, my phone is addicting as shit and i’m part of the population who is addicted to tiktok. it was something about a woman finding out her dog was a skinwalker. does anyone have any experience with those? 

  anyway, it went along the lines of her telling her “dog” to turn around and lay over, and then immediately closing the door on it because the dog DID do those things, and she hadn’t taught it to — and then the thing started knocking on her door…

  sounds like absolute bullshit, right? i thought the same. i really did. i forgot about that stupid video but for the past couple of days Cookie has been acting a little bit strange, she’s been charging out the door despite her being disciplined not to, not being really interested in dog activities like fetch or walks, she just chooses to sit on the couch. 

  i thought she might be getting depressed or something, but dude, i’ve been getting home late cause of studies, & she’s always just staring, watching, she doesn’t greet me like she used to. she’s just staring, almost like she’s analysing me. i know i sound insane. 

  anyway i’ve been alone at home the past couple of days as well, usually i’ve got
my parents with me, but i keep hearing these thumps on my door as well. they don’t sound like knocks, almost like a huge body thumping, but gently? if that makes sense? i’ve heard three knocks on my door as well, humanlike, but when i opened my door nobody was there. 

  here’s the shit that made me lose it, i came home at 1AM, as usual the past couple of days, and Cookie was once again not really interested in me. she didn’t even try to jump and lick my face like she used to. i was petting her in my room, her eyes seemed almost human, when i told her to sit. she didn’t listen, and i remembered the tiktok. i told her to spin, and she did it, halfway, then turned to look at me with those fucking weird ass human eyes. 

  no one has ever taught this dog how to spin. i’m serious, we only ever taught her to sit, my parents don’t train her and only i ever have. the way this dog just looked at me made me question everything. i gently gave her a few more pats & in my head, i thought “if you’re a demon, walk away and get out of my room”. she DID. i swear, i’m not losing it. 

  i shut the door after that, but i keep hearing those gentle thumps. this is killing me, i really want to check it out. she’s just a dog, and this is kinda stupid, i don’t really believe in that shit. 

 Alright, I checked it out — nothing was there. It was just the wind. You all can disregard this post. I don’t use my phone that much, so if I don’t reply, I apologise. Goodnight. :-)
