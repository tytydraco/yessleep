The following is the third file I retrieved from the government archive. It contains three things. The first is a case report written by someone who I will refer to as ‘Jane’. She apparently worked in a facility which housed the mentally unstable. I could not retrieve File-002, along with quite a few others.

File-004

CASE REPORT - Patient 888 “Jesse” 

Dr. \[//EXPUNGED DATA//\] writing.

SYMPTOMS

Patient was experiencing epileptic convulsions for a while, but recently they have stopped.

Patient did not talk until very recently, the day after the epileptic convulsions stopped.

Patient demonstrates self-harming behavior when not restrained.

Patient seems to have trouble walking on her own.

Patient begins to thrash wildly when touched.

BACKGROUND

Patient was found in a near-catatonic state in her home, after being wanted for questioning in the killing of the Becketts. She was covered in blood and was lying on the floor, staring at the ceiling. She was unresponsive.

We took ‘Jesse’ in on \[//EXPUNGED DATA//\], and have held her here for \[//EXPUNGED DATA//\]. She immediately displayed some of the symptoms I have listed above, such as thrashing when touched, trouble walking, and epileptic convulsions.

We did multiple tests to make sure that the convulsions were not going to harm her. The results came back: they were not affecting her mental state, only her physical state, and only occasionally.

At first, the patient did not demonstrate any behavior pointing to the fact that she might want to harm herself. Once she came out of the catatonic state she was in, which was only about a month after we got her, she did very little. In fact, we didn’t even have to restrain her until much more recently. 

She even spoke for a long period of time. Not much, but when she did speak, it was nonsense.

In addition to this, whenever the Becketts were mentioned, she began crying. She didn’t answer any questions, she just cried.

Last month, out of nowhere, she began acting aggressively toward the staff and towards herself. We put her under restraints, and had minimal contact with her. In addition, at the same time this happened, she stopped talking completely. She did not respond when the Becketts' names were mentioned. Her convulsions got worse, to the point where we had to have her temporarily transferred to a hospital and then back.

CURRENT

Patient’s state has deteriorated greatly. We expect her to only live for a few more days. Her seizures have become constant. Her convulsions are becoming more and more violent. Her tendencies have gotten to the point where if she sees another person, she will thrash wildly in an attempt to harm them, and if she cannot, she will attempt to harm herself.

ADDENDUM 

Dr. Marcus Vigenere writing.

Yesterday, Jesse escaped her cell. Three members of the staff were found dead, their corpses twisted in ways indicating the work of either a maniac or an expert. She then proceeded to walk out of the building uninterrupted. Many staff members are under interrogation for letting her walk free.

Jesse has yet to be located.

This file is troubling. The Addendum at the end looks to be added a few days after the rest of the report, as well as it being written by a different person. I can only assume that the worst happened to Jane.

The second object in File-004 is a flash drive with an audio file, titled jesse.mp3, on it. I can not attach the file itself, so I will do my best to describe what is on it here.

The recording opens with complete silence, and the white noise of a bad quality recording. Then, a male voice speaks. Throughout it talking, it gets closer and farther from the device being used to record. The voice breaks quite a bit, and is breathing hard. Occasionally, it sobs.

&#x200B;

“I need help. Help. Help, please. I hope this is recording.”

There is a banging as the recording device drops. There are slow, heavy footsteps in the distance, above wherever the device is. They move to the side, then there is the distant sound of a door slowly creaking open. The footsteps creak onto what sounds like stairs.

There’s a shuffling sound as the person on the recording grabs the camera and hides.

Then there is another voice, yelling in the background of the recording.

“Hello? Mr. Beckett?”

Silence.

“Mr. Beckett, are you here? It’s doctor Lam- doctor Vigenere. I’m here to help you,”

Still silence.

After a second, the footsteps ascend the staircase and fade out of the house. The voice begins talking again after a few seconds.

“He is not what he seems to be.”

Then the recording cuts out.

&#x200B;

I believe it is safe to assume that the same Marcus Vigenere who wrote the Addendum to the case report above is the one who was in this person’s home. But why was he there? And why was the person in the home seemingly scared of him? I don’t know this yet.

However, the user JenGosling managed to decipher the message in my previous post. Apparently, Vigenere is not his real last name. It is Lamfort. Why would he hide his real name? I don’t know this either.

I also do not know the identity of the person speaking on the recording. The quality is too bad to identify them.

I also found the following encrypted into the file itself. It is not the same cipher as in the last post. I have not as of yet managed to decipher this:

I am still confused, but I know even more about who this ‘Jesse’ the files are referring to might be, and what she is capable of. And it scares me.

Oh! That reminds me. On my last post, a user named der\_Retter commented that they were not Jesse, or a stranger, but a ‘concerned observer’. They asked me to message them. I shall do that right after I finish writing this. Hopefully, they can help me.
