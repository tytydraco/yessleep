**Captain's Log - Day 223**

The sound of the ship's engine was steady and comforting, reminding us about this marvel we have achieved  It was a sound that we all loved, and it pushed us when we felt at our lowest, and eventually, everything worked out fine "Hunter's Watch" I named it in honor of my best friend, Hunter  Hunter always dreamed of traveling the stars  He dreamed of being something bigger than himself  He passed away before he even stepped foot into a ship  And now here we were my crew and I, officially the first to travel this deep into the void of space  I hope Hunter is proud of me  Or maybe I just wanted to believe he could still watch over me somehow.

The crew is in good spirits tonight. I've passed the final checkpoint, breaking every boundary known to humanity. I can't help but feel a sense of pride for what we've accomplished. The stars seem brighter, almost closer, as if the universe acknowledges our success. I've decided to let the crew unwind. They've earned it, and, honestly, so have I.

**Part One -**

The standard room was alive with laughter and the clinking of glasses. The air carried a warmth it hadn't known in weeks, and the weight of responsibility was briefly lighter on my shoulders. We had done it. We had gone further than anyone else in human history, and this celebration was as much for the crew as it was for the mission.

"To the Watch!" boomed Alex, my second-in-command. His voice filled the room, commanding attention as always. He was the kind of guy who could light up any room, his broad grin a beacon of confidence. A former Navy pilot, Alex had the swagger of someone who'd cheated death more times than he could count. He held up his glass, the amber liquid inside catching the room's dim light.

"To the Watch!" we all echoed, raising our glasses.

Carmen, our engineer, leaned back in her chair, a faint smile tugging at her lips. Her dark curls framed her face, damp with sweat from another long day in the engine room. Carmen was the ship's backbone, keeping us running smoothly, But beneath her calm exterior was a deeply religious woman. She never missed her evening prayers, and I often saw her counting her rosary beads when she thought no one was looking. Tonight, though, her rosary stayed tucked away, her laughter unguarded. Even though we didn't share the same beliefs, I respected her for that. Everyone needs an anchor, especially in a time like this.

Across from her sat Malik, our medical officer. Quiet, methodical, and sharp as a scalpel, Malik had a way of observing people that made you feel like he could see straight through you, intimidating at times, to be honest. He rarely joined in the laughter, but when he did, it was genuine. He had joined this mission to escape the ghosts of his past, a wife lost to cancer, a life he could no longer bear on Earth. I never pried, but the pain in his eyes told me all I needed to know. Sometimes, I wonder if he can see mine. I always thought Hunter and I would go through this together, and it pains me.

Ellie, our communications specialist, was perched on the edge of her seat, her excitement bubbling over. She was young, brilliant, and energetic, with a knack for deciphering signals that had baffled entire teams back on Earth. Ellie was the kind of person who could find beauty in static, and her enthusiasm was infectious. She reminded me of Hunter that way, always chasing the unknown and eager for the subsequent discovery.

And then there was me: Bryan, captain of Hunter's Watch. I'd spent my whole life preparing for this mission, pouring every ounce into making it a reality. Command was a lonely place, but it was a burden I'd chosen willingly. This ship, this crew, this journey was everything I had ever wanted.

Isaiah, the ship's AI, said over the intercom, "Captain, would you like me to adjust the temperature in the common room? I detect a slight drop that may affect comfort levels."

"We're fine, Isaiah," I said. "Why don't you take the night off?"

"As you wish, Captain," Isaiah replied, his voice smooth and emotionless. Something was unsettling about how human he sounded sometimes, but I dismissed it as nerves. Tonight was a night for celebration, not paranoia.

The drinks flowed freely, and the laughter grew louder. It was Ellie who first suggested the idea that changed everything.

**Part Two -**

"You guys ever tried an Ouija board?" Ellie asked, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Carmen's smile disappeared instantly. "That's not funny, Ellie," she said sharply. "You don't mess with things like that."

"Oh, come on," Ellie said, rolling her eyes. "It's just a game. We're out here in the middle of nowhere. Let's do something weird."

Alex chuckled. "I'm in. What about you, Cap?"

I hesitated  Part of me wanted to shut it down, to keep things light and straightforward  But another part of me, the part that had always been drawn to the unknown, was curious We'd been alone out here for so long  A little weirdness wouldn't hurt.

"Alright," I said, relenting, "But if this turns into some horror movie shit, I'm kicking your ass, Ellie."

Ellie grinned and ran off into her quarters, returning a few minutes later with a worn wooden board and a planchette. The wood looked ancient, and the edges had worn smoothly for years. The letters and numbers were faded but still legible, and the intricate carvings around the edges seemed to pulse faintly in the low light—some very cliche shit.

"You've had that the whole time?" Malik asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Never leave Earth without it," she said, setting it on the table with a wink.

Carmen crossed herself and muttered a prayer under her breath. "This is a bad idea," she said, but she didn't leave the room.

We all gathered around the table, the Ouija board at the center. The atmosphere had shifted, the air growing heavy with an unspoken tension. Ellie placed her fingers on the planchette, and one by one, we all followed.

"Alright, who wants to go first?" Ellie asked, her voice quieter now.

"Is there anyone here with us?" Alex said, grinning.

It was quiet at first, and then the planchette began to move, spelling the word - "**YES.**"

"Stop it; you guys are moving it," said Carmen.

"I'm not," Ellie whispered, her face pale. I wouldn't be telling the truth if that didn't send a chill down my spine.

Nothing happened momentarily, and Alex said, "Who are you?"

The planchette sat still, the silence stretching on uncomfortably. Then, slowly, it began to move.

It didn't answer the question. Instead, it spelled out the word - "**UMBRAL**."

"What the hell does that mean?" Ellie said.

A heavy silence settled over us. We were all stunned. *"Umbral?"* That wasn't a word you expected to hear from an Ouija board. But as the moments stretched on, something shifted in the room. The temperature dropped sharply and unnaturally as if the air had recoiled in terror.

Like a ghost, the cold spread through the spaceship, moving through the metal walls and curling around us as if it had its own will. This wasn't the ordinary chill of a malfunctioning thermal system. No, this was something much deeper, something old and forgotten. The cold had weight, a suffocating presence, as though it was draining the very life from the ship.

It sank into our skin, cutting through fabric and biting into bone, leaving us frozen. We shivered, not just from the cold, but from an instinctive, bone-deep knowing we were no longer alone.

"I think it's time to say goodbye, right guys?" said Carmen, snapping us out of this state of mind.

We all nodded in agreement and ended the session under Ellie's calm guidance. But as we did, a strange weight settled over us, something we couldn't shake. It felt like the air was thick with unseen eyes, watching from the ship's dark corners, waiting for something.

I pushed myself to my feet, trying to pull the crew back to reality to reassure them that it was over, But it force tugged at me, something drawing my gaze toward the window, toward the infinite blackness beyond. I stepped closer as though the void had reached out and whispered my name  And before I could stop myself, my hands pressed against the cold glass  I leaned in, straining to hear, as if something—or someone—was out there, beckoning.

As I pulled myself away from the window, a low and chilling voice whispered in the stillness: *"You shouldn't have called to us."* My heart froze. Was I losing my mind? Did something—*someone*—speak from the emptiness of space itself? Maybe I had too much to drink. But even as the thought crossed my mind, the cold lingered, And I wasn't sure it was over.

**Part Three -**

The days after the Ouija session blurred together like time had warped. At first, it was a subtle, Minor, strange occurrence that no one wanted to acknowledge fully. The temperature fluctuations became more frequent. A chill that no one could explain would settle in the standard room despite the fully operational heating systems. We'd look at each other, uneasy, but dismiss it as a malfunction, an issue that could easily be fixed with a routine check. The events occurring days prior seem forgettable, almost forceful.

But then the whispers began. At first, it was just a soft murmur, an indistinct sound that seemed to be coming from nowhere. We'd look at each other, confused. "Did you hear that?" someone would ask, but no one was around when we looked. For me, a voice within the whispers seems almost familiar yet uncanny.

One night, I was in the cockpit, staring at the stars, trying to understand everything. I'd been standing there for hours, lost in thought. What I experienced the other day was lurking in the depths of my thoughts but not making itself known. The hum of the engines was comforting, but it felt... off. The ship felt too quiet. The monitors flickered, the static more pronounced than usual, and I saw something, just a glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. A shadow moved across the hall outside the cockpit. I stood up, my heart pounding, but no one was there when I opened the door.

By the time we hit the third day after the session, things started to unravel quickly, like a potent virus attacking the body. Carmen was the first to crack. She'd been spending more and more time in the engine room, refusing to join us at meals, her eyes constantly darting around. One evening, I found her muttering under her breath, clutching her rosary with white knuckles. When she saw me, she froze, her face pale and sweaty. I approached her, but before I could speak, she whispered something that froze me in my tracks. "They're here, Captain," she said, her voice a chilling murmur. "They've found us... It's our fault."

The words caught in my throat, but I forced myself to speak[. In](http://asspeak.In) that instant, everything came rushing back, like a caged beast finally breaking free, tearing through the darkness with a furious, unstoppable force.

I stumbled over my words, my voice trembling as I asked, "What...what are you talking about, Carmen?" But deep down, I already knew. Even as I tried to push the thought away, it clung to me like a shadow, refusing to let go.

Her eyes welled up with tears. "The things... the things we called with that board. They're in the ship. They're in me." Her voice cracked as she broke down, clutching the rosary as though it could shield her from something unseen. That night, she locked herself in the engine room. We could hear her sobbing, but no one dared approach.

Malik wasn't doing any better. The man who had once been the picture of composure started unraveling frighteningly. His paranoia grew with every passing hour. He would pace the halls, eyes darting, talking to himself in fragmented sentences. He became obsessed with the idea that we were being watched. That something was hunting us.

"I saw her, Bryan," Malik said. "My wife, she's here".

Noticing my crew members losing their minds in such a short amount of time was haunting. It was as if a shadow had fallen over them, pulling at their sanity, distorting their faces with fear and confusion. Their eyes, once full of life and purpose, now seemed hollow, glazed over by an invisible terror. The change was so sudden, so unnatural, it felt like we were all being consumed from the inside out. I need to go and check on everyone else.

I went to check up on Alex. However, he seemed to be okay, or I thought. I caught him in the standard room, drinking and laughing things off. He was trying to ease off the tension with jokes; however, the humor didn't reach his eyes. He seemed soulless in a sense, a void within those eyes of his. As I went to speak with him, he began to drink more and more, his laughter becoming hollow. It seemed he felt my presence because he stopped. With liquid spilling from his mouth, he gasped out slowly, "They want us, they want our souls. They're coming for us, one by one."

I retreated in fear and went looking for Ellie.

I couldn't ignore how Ellie started spending more and more time with the Ouija board after the session. As I searched for her, a heavy unease settled in. I knew I had to handle this carefully, but something told me it was too late.

I found her alone in her room, sitting on the cold floor, the Ouija board spread out before her. The planchette was moving erratically, but she wasn't touching it. No one was. It was as if some invisible force had taken control, making the planchette dance across the board with a life of its own.

"Ellie," I said, my voice shaking. Her head jerked up, and when she spoke, it wasn't her voice anymore. It was deep and unnatural, land coming from beyond human comprehension. "Ah, Captain," the voice purred, rich with a dark, unsettling intelligence. "You still believe you're in control, don't you? How quaint. You've breached the boundary, crossed into the void where your kind was never meant to tread. You've invited us, summoned us, though you don't understand what you've done. We've always watched, always waited. Time is a fleeting moment to us, a mere illusion you cling to in your desperate attempts to escape what you cannot comprehend. Your feeble limitations do not bind us. You cannot escape us. You never could. The stars bow before us, and so will you, in time. We are the darkness that predates your existence, and now we shall feast."

I stepped back, fear crawling up my spine. Ellie's eyes rolled back in her head, and the board began to shake violently, the planchette moving erratically, spelling out a chilling message: "HELP US."

I stumbled out of her room, my mind racing, struggling to process what had happened. The speed at which everything was unraveling was beyond comprehension like the very fabric of time had been twisted as if the speed of light itself was being used against us. My legs carried me into a dimly lit hallway, but suddenly, I came to a dead stop. The door to my room was wide open at the end of the corridor, But the darkness from it was suffocating, unnatural, as if something was waiting, watching, lurking in the void. And then I saw him. Hunter.

**Final Part -**

At first, I thought I was hallucinating. But there he was, standing in the doorway, his face twisted and disfigured, mangled as if something had chewed him up and spit him out. His eyes were black voids, empty of all life, but they stared right at me. I opened my mouth to speak, but no words came out. He grinned, his mouth stretching unnaturally wide, revealing sharp, jagged teeth that looked like they had been waiting to sink into my flesh.

"You did this, Bryan," his voice rasped, a sound that was more a scraping of metal than words. "You brought me here. You're all mine now."

I screamed, backing away. But Hunter's image flickered like a broken screen. In the blink of an eye, he was gone.

I scream for Isaiah. I run towards the cockpit. My hands shake as I tap on the control panel, hoping for a response from the ship's AI. But nothing. The screens are still blank, mocking me with their silence. "Isaiah," I mutter, pressing my palm to the cold metal of the console, my voice low. "What's going on? Report." Nothing. The silence presses in around me, suffocating. For a second, I wonder if the AI's gone offline or has been consumed by whatever's taking over the ship. I swallow hard, tapping the console again. My fingers hover over the keys, but I can't make them move.

"Isaiah, please," I say, my voice strained, cracking under the fear gnawing at me. "I need you."

A sharp crack shatters the silence, and then, without warning, Isaiah's voice fills the room. But it's not right. There's something off about it, a resonance, something cold, hollow, that makes my skin crawl. "Captain Bryan…"

I freeze, my heart pounding in my chest. "Isaiah? What's happening?"

The lights flicker again, and the walls—*the walls*—shift. The whole damn ship seems to warp like reality itself is being torn apart and rewritten. I take a step back from the console, my legs feeling weak, like the floor is moving beneath me.

"Captain…"

The voice is still Isaiah's, but now... it's different. It's laced with something else. Something darker. Ancient. My breath catches in my throat as I grip the edge of the panel to steady myself.

The screen flickers to life before me, but what it shows doesn't make sense. The letters are twisted and warped, like they're alive, coiling on the screen like snakes. I can't look away.

"Isaiah, stop," I say, panic rising in my chest. "Please, just stop."

But the voice only grows colder, more chilling.

"I am not Isaiah…" it hisses, each word dripping with malice. "We are the things that watch. The things that wait."

I stood frozen, paralyzed by terror. The thing bellowed one last, earth-shattering phrase. "Do you hear them? The ones who call from the depths of the darkness? The Umbral... they've taken this ship, and now, Bryan... they claim you."

The lights flickered and sputtered, and then everything went still. The sudden darkness swallowed me, leaving me in a suffocating, inescapable void. The hum of the ship's systems, the faint whir of the air vents, all of it… gone. The silence pressed in like a heavyweight, crushing the air from my lungs. My heart pounded, but I couldn't hear it or my breath. It was as if the world had muted itself, holding its breath.

I heard something shift, a sow, indistinct, something moving just beyond my senses, skittering through the darkness. At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks, but then unearthly screams echoed within the ship. They were distant at first but grew louder and more frantic as if souls were being torn apart just beyond the edge of reality. Like nails on a chalkboard, the sound scraped against my sanity, piercing the silence. The walls groaned under the weight of the cries as if they, too, were suffering from the pain that filled the air. The darkness around me didn't just feel wrong; it suffocated me. It was alive, pulsing with an unnatural energy, with something that *waited* for me to break, to give in. My body tensed, frozen in place, unable to escape the nightmarish sounds that seemed to wrap themselves around me, pushing me further into the abyss.

I was being surrounded, overtaken, the pressure closing in from all sides. It was suffocating, like the universe's weight was bearing on me, forcing me to my knees. I saw it just as I thought I couldn't take any more. A light, small at first, cut through the suffocating darkness of space—a distant but burning brighter star growing with an unnatural intensity. The faint glow pierced the black void, creeping into the ship and offering a fleeting sense of warmth as if some outside force had come to pull me from the depths. But the warmth was fleeting, too brief. It flickered and died, swallowed by a bone-chilling cold that slammed into me, a cold so fierce, so alien, it was as if the very essence of the void had pierced my soul. I couldn't breathe. It was a cold, unlike anything I'd ever felt, a crushing, consuming cold that made my skin crawl.

As the light neared, its glow now blinding, I saw them.

Standing before me were creatures, no, they were twisted, mangled husks of what had once been human. I couldn't tell. Their bodies were grotesque, bent at impossible angles, their skin stretched thin and mottled, as though the flesh had been pulled too tightly over their bones, straining to contain something foul beneath. Their eyes were black pools of endless, soulless darkness devoid of humanity. But in that void, I could feel the pure, unrelenting evil that pulsed through them like a torrent of poison flowing through their veins. It was a malevolent, ancient, suffocating force, as if the darkness that consumed them was reaching into my soul, pulling me toward something far worse. They moved toward me, slow and deliberate, like predators circling their injured prey, their limbs jerking and twitching with unnatural movements. Each step they took made my blood run colder. Their mouths hung open in silent screams, their jagged teeth dripping with some vile fluid, as if they did not need to make noise—they *were* the noise. They were the *end*.

Behind them, more shapes emerged from the shadows. My crewmates, or what was left of them, were just as twisted and wrong. Their features were barely recognizable, their bodies corrupted, contorted into forms that should not exist. The air around them thickened with the stench of decay, of death. Demonic? Maybe. But there was no word for what stood before me. They were born from the depths of a nightmare that had clawed its way into existence through the cracks of reality. And they were coming for me.

I lay there, broken, my body trembling with defeat, the weight of despair pressing down on me. Every breath felt like a struggle, my limbs frozen, my spirit shattered. The horrors around me seemed endless, these twisted creatures that had once been human now nothing but empty vessels of malice. I was so far gone that I didn't know if I could move anymore. The air was thick with the stench of decay, the whispers of the void creeping into my mind, promising me an escape from the agony.

Then, there was a shift. A presence, familiar and strange, swept through the darkness.

"Bryan..." The voice called out, warm, soothing, and eerily familiar.

I turned my head, fighting against the weight of the darkness, and saw him. *Hunter.* But... *not* Hunter.

His form was more straightforward now, his human shape unmistakable, standing tall in front of me, his face soft, his eyes warm, the man I had known and trusted. He smiled at me, a smile I hadn't seen in a long time. In a time like this, it was welcoming.

"Bryan, You've been through so much. You don't need to keep fighting anymore. I'm here with you; we can finally do this together like we dreamed of." His voice was thick with sorrow, but there was a dark undertone to it now, something twisted that lurked beneath his words. "I've seen it, felt it... You don't have to bear it alone anymore. You can escape all of this. All the pain. All the suffering. I can give you what you've always wanted."

My heart skipped. I reached out to him instinctively, drawn to that familiar face, the last vestige of my humanity.

"Bryan..." His voice broke through the haze in my mind, now a little more desperate, but there was a taunting edge to it. "Take it. Take the power I offer. Become one of us. Become something more."

I reached out, my fingers brushing the edge of his hand, but his face twisted just as I touched him. His human form flickered like a fading light, and before I could react, his body shifted, contorting violently as the air around him grew dense with an oppressive force. His features warped and stretched, his smile turned into a grotesque snarl, his skin began to blacken and tear, revealing the monstrosity beneath. His eyes, the same black voids as the others, stared into me with malevolent hunger.

The ground trembled, the space around me warping as the very fabric of reality seemed to tear open. His voice, once comforting, was now a guttural growl that made my insides churn.

"You should’ve known, Bryan," he hissed. "You thought I was offering salvation... but I am the truth."

His form stretched, expanding, distorting until he was a towering figure of pure horror, his body an amalgamation of sharp angles, twisted limbs, and darkness that seemed to pour from every crack in his being. The shadows within him roared like ancient beasts calling from the depths of the abyss. I tried to move, to scream, but I couldn’t. My body was frozen, trapped in place by the force of his presence.

It wasn’t just darkness. It wasn’t just an empty void. No, this was something infinitely worse. The Umbral was a hunger, a hunger that never dies. A relentless, gnawing hunger that stretches across eternity, consuming everything in its path, devouring time itself like a ravenous beast. It fed on the living, the dead, the forgotten. It was a force woven into the fabric of nature itself, a malignancy so ancient, so entrenched in the universe’s pulse, that it would never leave. Even when humanity crumbled to dust, when the very idea of existence was but a whisper lost in the cosmos, they would remain a force as inevitable as death itself. The Umbral wasn’t just a part of the universe. It was the universe in all its twisted, eternal hunger. The embodiment of nothingness turned into something worse, a malignant force, waiting, lurking, always poised to consume.

As the darkness consumed me, as the Umbral twisted its way into every fiber of my being, I felt myself slipping away, the man I once was dying with each passing second. My mind fractured, my body no longer mine. The shadows inside me grew, filling the empty spaces until nothing was left but hunger. My voice... it wasn’t my own anymore. It was cold and hollow like something ancient and predatory had taken root in my soul.

I turned my gaze if you could even call it that, toward the void, toward you, the one who dares to listen.

"You think you're safe," I rasped, my voice a twisted mockery of what it once was, "But you are already ours. You are already being watched. You will join us. soon."

And in that moment, you’ll know what it means to truly become the **Umbral.**

**The End.**
