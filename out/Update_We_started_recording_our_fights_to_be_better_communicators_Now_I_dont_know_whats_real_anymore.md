Hey again. I didn’t think I’d post a follow-up, but a few of your comments have been stuck in my head ever since. Stuff like, “Try a video recording,” or, “Get a burner phone, see if the recordings continue,” or even, “Something’s feeding on your fights.”

At first, that sounded like Reddit doing its thing, creepy for fun. But now? I don’t know. I don’t feel like I’m in control of any of this.

Emma’s still at her sister’s. She’s barely replying to my texts. I didn’t tell her I bought a cheap GoPro knockoff and a burner phone from a gas station. I wasn’t trying to be sneaky and I just didn’t know how to explain it without sounding like I’ve completely lost it. Because honestly, I might be.

I set up the camera in our living room, pointed at the couch. Same spot where most of our “serious talks” happened. I left the burner phone on the kitchen counter. Then I went upstairs around 10pm and tried to sleep. Just wanted to catch… whatever was happening when we weren’t in the room.

Next morning, I checked the footage.

The first hour? Normal. Empty room. Refrigerator buzzing. Pipes creaking.

Then at 11:17pm, the audio cuts out. No fade. No glitch. Just clean silence. But the video keeps going.

About thirty seconds later, Emma walks into frame. Except… it’s not right. Her movements are weird. Too stiff. Like she’s walking while dreaming. She’s wearing a hoodie I’ve never seen before. A few seconds later, I walk in too.

Except I didn’t.

I was upstairs the entire night. I checked my sleep tracker, no movement recorded. No change in breathing. Heart rate steady. I was out cold.

On the video, we sit on the couch and start talking, but there’s no sound. It’s like watching someone else act out a version of our relationship that never happened. At one point, I reach out to touch her shoulder, and she jerks away like I slapped her. Then she stands up, starts pacing. Glances toward the camera—no, stares at it. Like she sees it. Like she sees me watching.

The video skips ahead a few minutes. Glitches, like bad buffering. Suddenly we’re both standing. Still talking. She’s crying now. I look… furious. But the worst part?

Just for a second, literally two frames, someone else enters the room.

Top left corner. Half-stepped into view. Too tall. Limbs too long. Completely blurred out. Like it wasn’t meant to be seen.

And then it’s gone.

The camera keeps rolling for another hour. Nothing else happens.

I grabbed the burner phone. A new voice memo was saved. Two hours long. Same timestamp.

I didn’t press record.

I played it anyway.

Same argument. Same words from before. But at the end, just like last time, that voice returned.

“Now we’re all caught up.”

But this time it kept going.

“She’s already watching.”
“Let him finish the update.”

I stopped the playback. My hands were shaking.

Here’s the part that’s messing me up the most: I still had the video. Still had the audio. I saw what I saw. I thought about uploading it, just to prove I’m not insane. But when I tried?

I couldn’t.

Reddit wouldn’t let me attach it. Every upload failed. Tried a still frame…black screen. File name changed itself to “_alreadyWatched.mp4.” I didn’t do that. I tried sending it to my laptop. Email, cloud, AirDrop and nothing worked. Then, sometime last night, it was just… gone. Not in the trash. Not in recent files. Just vanished.

So yeah. I know how this sounds. “Sure, the video disappeared, how convenient.”

But maybe that’s the point.

Maybe whatever this is, it wants to be heard, but not seen. Maybe the camera caught something we weren’t supposed to see. Something it won’t let anyone else see again.

I don’t know what’s real anymore. But if I post again, if I start acting weird, if my tone feels off, just do me a favor.

Tell me.

Because I’m not sure I’d notice.
