It started off as an ordinary day of school in the early 2000s. I must have been 12-13 years old, a teenager in high school here in Germany. We were about to have computer class after the big break, and I arrived a bit later than my classmates at the hallway where the class took place. Imagine a \~3m wide and \~8m long corridor with 2-3 doors/rooms on each side. Upon my arrival, I immediately noticed that our teacher was late since everyone was standing in the hallway.

I started walking towards my classmates and passed the first door on my right. I continued walking and, as I was passing the second door on my right, in the corner of my eye, I recognized that the door handle was being pushed down rapidly, seemingly from the inside of the room, as none of my classmates were standing in front of the door, nor was anyone interacting with it. For those unfamiliar with European door handles, feel free to Google them as they differ from handles in the US (we don't use knobs here).

Once I realized what I had seen, I gathered the attention of some of my classmates, asking if anyone was in that room while I was already grabbing the handle, trying to open the door. It was locked.

At that moment, I was hit by a visible wave of confusion, telling my classmates that I clearly saw the handle move. I was totally sure, even though I only saw it out of the corner of my eye.

A good amount of classmates got totally excited with me. Teenage excitement, I guess. I don't remember if anyone else saw the handle moving besides me, but suddenly we were hysterical about the thought that someone was in that room. I don't clearly remember who initially had the idea, but the next thing we did was write something like "Is there someone in the room?" on a piece of paper and put it right in the door slit on the floor. Each time we placed a piece of paper, it was half in the room and half in the hallway on our side of the door. The following events may not be in exact order since this happened more than 15 years ago, so I'll list them as I remember they took place, with the last one being in place for sure:

1. Pieces of paper got sucked into the room as if they were quickly pulled in from the other side of the door. The draw-in was very fast. At this point, we went absolutely crazy but obviously kept going. We were all pretty much convinced that someone was in that room.
2. Pieces of paper got pushed back out to us, but not even slowly, rather like a strong gust of wind or draught would do. These two phenomena could have been explained through draught, wind, or any other physical explanation, but as we now come to the third and last point, we were all baffled...
3. The last sheet of paper we placed made this experience something I cannot explain rationally to myself or others. It was a whole paper page laid as just described beneath the door, half on our side in the hallway, half in the room. This time, the right-hand corner of the sheet on our side of the door started rolling itself in! Just as if one would place their finger on the corner tip and smoothly let their finger slide until they get a tight small roll, like starting to roll a straw if you would roll the paper in tightly all the way. It was rolling itself just about 6cm in to the corner, and then it stopped. It wasn't that the corner of the paper just bent a bit; no, it started to tightly roll itself up!

It was very silent when it happened, and it got pretty quickly loud afterward. Everyone was kind of freaking out, I guess, and that was pretty much the exact moment when our teacher arrived. Can you already guess what happened next? Of course, we hysterically told her someone was locked in that room, and she went to unlock the door. What else could she do when half of the class is in distress about some pieces of paper? The door unlocked, and all we did was stare into an empty classroom. There was not a single person in there. I stepped foot into the room to completely make sure that no one was in it and all windows were shut, which was both the case. The pieces of paper that had gotten sucked in were scattered around the door on the inside. Nothing more than what we had written on them was on them, and neither were they in a different shape or ripped. The teacher gave it a good laugh and locked the room. We went on with our class.

I remember that everyone was somewhat disturbed by that experience, but after a while, almost everyone moved on from it, and only a few of us still spoke about it years later. I guess most of them would still remember it if they were reminded of it. I am in sparse contact with one of my classmates, she was one of those who stood next to me in first row to the door when it all happened, and she also stands 100% by what she saw, which is what I described above.

With this, I’d be interested to hear your thoughts on the story. I hope I’ve captured the experience as vividly as it was for us, and I’m curious if others have had similar encounters. Thanks for reading, and have a good night.
