I haven't been able to sleep in days. I'm really concerned about my safety now. I don't know what's going on. I'm not a very good artist but I thought I might give it a chance and draw the individual for myself.

I did. Though, It was quite messy to say the least. I had their face scribbled out. Something was missing. I couldn't complete the picture.

The day the incident occurred I was walking out late at night to visit my friends in an abandoned hospital which happened to be near an abandoned circus. But on the way there, On the footpath just a few blocks down away from me standing still under the lamppost I saw a man.

He wore a purple trench coat & a pair of gloves. His face was obscured by the darkness coming from under the light so it was hard to see the rest of his body from there. But before I could even process the figure standing there he disappeared in front of my very eyes.

So I'm going to chalk this down to the odd case of "transient visual hallucinations". You know, When people see things that aren't really there and they disappear again like nothing ever happened? Why should it bother me?

Anyways, When I got there my friends were already messing about in the hospital. They were kicking chairs about and making noise to see if any ghosts would pop out. Now obviously, nothing happened while we were there. I mean, what do you expect?

Besides being in an abandoned hospital at dark, the scenery was beautiful, creepy, eerie, uncomfortable to say the least. We had a few smokes while we were there in one of the hospitals patient rooms and we took a few pictures.

We were getting ready to leave when we heard running in the hallway coming towards us. It was a man wearing all black and looking disheveled while holding a knife.

My friends and I tackled him to the concrete floor before we started kicking and stomping on him over and over again until he was knocked out cold.

I looked down at the man and noticed he was wearing the purple trench coat I had seen earlier that night but without the gloves this time.

We all left the building and we all went our separate ways for the night.

That marked the end to that madness.

I finished the drawing.

The disheveled man and the man standing under the light happened to be the same individual.

It was my face. Albeit, A much older and wrinkly face at that.

No, this wasn't anything paranormal. I drew my face on the individual's missing face on purpose just to complete the picture. I still don't know what the figure actually looks like.

But I can confirm one thing.

The man's purple trench coat was an exact duplicate of my purple trench coat that I wore the same night of these appearances.

What could this mean?
