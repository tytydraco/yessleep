I’m almost sure you’ve seen one. They’re there in pretty much every major city. Those small, dingy establishments that you hardly ever see anybody going into. It could be a barber shop, or a nail salon. But more often than not, they tend to be restaurants. Some place with a generic name, an unenticing exterior, almost as if they couldn’t care less about attracting any customers.

Because, well, they probably don’t.

Now I’m not saying that every place fitting this description is being used to wash drug money or something. There’s hardly a good way to know for sure. At least none that wouldn’t involve putting yourself in danger trying to find out. But for the longest time, I had been absolutely convinced that was the case for the small Mexican restaurant sitting right across the street from where I lived.

It’s a tiny building tucked in between an equally sketchy pawn shop and a liquor store. Yeah, I don’t live in the best part of town. The advertising for the place consisted of a plain white sign with the words “Taste of Mexico” plastered across it in plain, yellow font. The words were accompanied by two cartoon sombreros sitting at either end.

During the eleven months that I’ve lived in this apartment complex, I can count on two hands the number of different people that I’ve seen going in there. Watching the place had become something of a pseudo-hobby for me. I don’t know how to explain it but it almost felt… dangerous. As if it were something that I wasn’t meant to stick my nose into.

I’ll go ahead and describe some of the more “interesting” observations that I’ve made over the months.

First of all, I was exaggerating a bit when I said that I could count the amount of different people that have gone into the place with two hands alone. Realistically it’s been more than that. Still not a lot. Maybe like thirty to forty different customers in total, mostly consisting of what appear to be drunk young people going in late at night.

But with that said, there’s only ever been a few people I’ve seen going in there more than once. One of them is this dude that’s always wearing sunglasses and a suit. He’s tall, lanky. Tattoos covering his hands. I’ve seen him maybe about a dozen times, always between 10 and 11 PM on a Thursday.

And here’s the weird thing about him. He’s never in there for more than a few minutes, and he always comes out empty-handed. So not quite sure what’s going on there. It’s hard to even speculate.

There’s another guy who I assume to be the cook based on the fact that he always come out wearing an apron, one that’s usually stained a deep red. I estimate that he’s about two-hundred and fifty pounds, most of which is muscle. He usually comes out during night, usually to smoke a cigarette or two.

And then there’s the strangest one out of the bunch. A plain-looking guy who’s maybe in his early twenties who’s always wearing a green windbreaker and jeans. I think I’ve seen him going in there close to a hundred times. The most frequent customer by far. Now the freaky part about this guy is that I have never seen him leaving. It’s not like I’m watching this place for hours at a time. But it still doesn’t quite track. I know what you’re thinking. He’s probably going out the back door. And I thought that might’ve been the case as well.

So I decided to run an experiment of sorts. One involving two video cameras. One I had lying around, the other borrowed from my sister.

I left the first one recording on my windowsill, facing the street. The other was well hidden inside a bush in the parking behind the restaurant, facing the back door.

I set both of them to start recording on a Friday morning, the one day out of the week that the rain jacket guy almost always shows up.

I went about my day and then I picked them up twenty-four hours later. To my relief the camera in the bush was still there and still recording.

Once back in my apartment, I began fast-forwarding through the footage from the windowsill camera and sure enough, rain jacket guy goes into the restaurant at 2:45 PM. Then I took the camera from the bush and I began fast-forwarding through that one, pausing any time somebody would come out from the door.

There were a few that did. But not one of them was the guy in the jacket. I continued scrubbing through the footage, feeling a pit forming in my stomach as I got to the 9 PM mark.

The guy in the jacket was back. Entering the restaurant without ever having left it. Of course I refrained from drawing any drastic conclusions just yet. It could have been two people who looked extremely similar. Right?

I exported the footage from both cameras to my laptop and then watched them back in separate windows. One playing from 2:45 PM and the other from 9 PM. At first I thought the footage must have gotten corrupted somehow. Not only was it absolutely the same guy… his first and second entrances looked just about identical. The same walk, same path, same mannerisms down to the minute details. As if the same footage had been cut and pasted into separate parts of a movie.

I rewatched it about fifty times, trying to analyze it, to find any difference at all. But there were none.

And this wasn’t the only fucked up thing that I saw. At around 2AM, the chef came out the back door. He tossed some trash bags into the dumpster and then sat on the steps, smoking a cigarette. Given how dark it was, it took some time for me to make out the details of his face. But eventually I was able to. And it looked like he was staring right at the camera. I mean I can’t tell for sure. But that’s what it fucking looked like.

So after he’s done smoking the cigarette he goes over to a car parked off frame. I can hear some indistinct noises, some rustling. He walks back carrying a duffle back and there’s something moving around inside of it. But not like a human. Or even an animal. I don’t know how to explain it. It was fucking weird.

Right before he opens the door and goes back inside, he suddenly turns around, standing still and staying that way for nearly three full minutes. I couldn’t see his face at all, but I could guess well enough what he was looking at.

Eventually he turned back around and closed the door shut behind him.

The remainder of the footage revealed nothing of note. But what I’d already seen was more than enough to make me feel as if I should drop any further investigation.

But even so, I couldn’t help but continue watching the place, that morbid curiosity refusing to fade.

There was one surefire way to satisfy it. By simply going inside.

I could feel my sensible side starting to take over and so I prepared myself. I texted one of my friends, told him where I was going and that if I didn’t text him back by midnight I was probably in some deep shit and to send the cops over there.

A bit drastic, I know. But there was something telling me that it wouldn’t be a bad idea.

It took a bit of convincing but he seemed to tentatively agree and at around noon I left my apartment and made my way down the stairs, through the lobby, out onto the strangely empty streets. Begin walking at a snail’s pace towards the place and as I cross the street I realize this is the closest I’ve ever been to it.

The paint looks old, chipped off in some parts. The building doesn’t look too bad. Also old but relatively well-maintained. At least not bad enough to invite any government intervention. I took a few deep breaths before pushing open the door and walking inside.

Upon first glance I was almost relieved. It was similar enough to most other Mexican restaurants I’d been to, which was strangely comforting in a way. It was clean, also well-maintained. It was nearly empty save for an impatient-looking man in a dress shirt sitting at one of the tables. The only other person I could see was a young woman sitting behind the bar. Once I stepped in, she walked over to me slowly.

“One?” she asked.

I nodded.

She gestured to one of the booths and I sat down. She gave me the menu, poured me some water and there had been nothing strange about the experience up to this point.

She turned to walk away and I could see the man in the dress shirt trying to get her attention. But she completely ignored him. The man seemed understandably taken aback and he looked over at me as if trying to validate his frustration.

I just shrugged as if to indicate to him yeah, that was a bit strange.

I continued sitting there, looking around the place when I realized that I couldn’t actually smell any food. The only scent detectable was an extremely faint ammonia.

A few minutes later, the woman stood up and walked over to the door beside the bar, one that I had assumed led down to the kitchen. She opened it up and disappeared inside, leaving the door about halfway open.

I tilted my head to get a look inside. It wasn’t the kitchen. It was a set of stairs. But given the fact that it was unlit, there wasn’t much to see beyond the first few steps.

The man, completely pissed off at this point, threw his hands into the air.

“The fuck? I’ve been here for thirty-five minutes,” he shouted. “What the fuck is this?”

He stood up, stomping towards the door and opening it up all the way. I could see him shaking his head before turning to look at me.

“Dude, you seeing this? What the hell is this place?”

I got up and walked towards him. The two of us stared down into the darkness and it was absolute, impossible to tell how far it extended.

“Where the fuck did she go?” the man asked out loud.

And then he yelled down into it. “Hello?”

At this point he’s more amused than angry, evidenced by the huge grin on his face. He took out his phone, using it as a flashlight as he began walking down the steps.

I called after him. “Hey man, you sure this a good idea?”

He paused for a moment, seeming to consider it. “Maybe not,” he said. “But this is gonna get some crazy fucking views.”

And then he continued on down into the dark. Extremely paranoid at this point, I backed away from the stairs and began looking around the restaurant. That comforting vibe has completely faded and I get this sense that there’s somebody else close by. That I’m being watched. It’s hard for me to put a finger on why I’m feeling that way until I start focusing on the hallway leading to the bathrooms. It’s also extremely dark but I can see that the one of the doors is open. At first I could see nothing beyond the glints of his bulging eyes. But as my vision adjusted, I began to make out the rest of him.

It was the cook. Standing perfectly still in the darkness of the bathroom. Staring. Smiling.

I could feel myself becoming light-headed and I get the fuck out of there, nearly tripping on the sidewalk as I burst out the front door. I ran back towards my apartment, my heart still beating against my chest, my senses completely wired. I’m pacing around the living room, trying to reconcile what the hell had just happened when I start thinking about the man in the dress shirt.

I could feel the guilt beginning to creep in but there was absolutely no way I was going back in there to look for him. And I wasn’t too keen on calling the cops just yet either.

Instead I began watching the place, hoping to eventually see the guy coming out. Eventually I did see him. But he wasn’t coming out. He was going inside. Same hair, same clothes, same build. He was the same fucking man.

I turned away and I could feel my heart racing, regret and anxiety seeping into my bones. I should’ve never gone inside, I thought. Now they knew what I looked like.

For the next few days I avoided that place like the plague. I used the back door to leave my building for work, changed my route home so I wouldn’t have to cross paths with it on the way back. I kept my curtains closed, ensuring that at no point I could ever see it.

But about a week later I caved, sneaking a peak at the streets. What I saw was unexpected. The restaurant’s sign had been stripped, and it looked as if it were in the process of being repainted, as if some other business was set to take its place.

Of course my immediate reaction was that of relief. Whatever the hell was going on in that place, I wouldn’t have to deal with. My curiosity had yielded no consequences and I could continue living my life in peace.

A few days later, I was leaving for work and saw that the sign for the coffee shop attached to the ground floor of my apartment building had been stripped away and that the place appeared to be going through renovations. I didn’t think too much of it until I was coming back from work and saw what it was being replaced with.

*“Taste of Mexico.”*

I stared at the sign for a long time, but there was no way to rationalize it. Eventually I looked away and I could see somebody walking towards me from down the street. Somebody familiar.

The man in the dress shirt. No difference in appearance at all from the last time I’d seen him. He slowed his pace as he got closer before stopping no more than ten feet away. He looked up and directly at me, his face expressionless at first before a hint of a smile began to bleed through.

And then he went inside.
