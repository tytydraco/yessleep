I'm here to tell you about the night I'll never forget. I live in a different city than the one I go to soccer training in. It's about 3 miles between the cities, if no one can give me a ride, I've happened to ride a bike. This particular evening I had chosen to cycle, it was a cold February day when I set off, it was a bit slippery but I made it all the way. I completed the training, it was a really hard physical session.

 When I was going to go again, I was tired, but I had to go. When I got a few kilometers, my bike light suddenly went out, it was about 10:00 pm and it was pitch black, I couldn't see anything. I managed to pry my phone out, the screen lights up my face. When I check it, I see that there was only 3% left. There is no way I could ride my bike home without crashing. There was no one at home, both my parents were on a business trip and I didn't know anyone else with a car. I made the decision to call SOS and ask them nicely if there were any police patrols that weren't busy that could pick me up. So I called up and asked that very question, a nice lady said they could fix it. Just as I was about to say where I was, my phone died. I screamed out of anger and fear at the same time. The panic that came upon me then was immense, I decided that the only choice was to sleep in the ditch along the dark and eerie forest road.

 I cried myself to sleep that night, I just wanted to go home. Finally I must have fallen asleep because I woke up to something pulling my foot, it was dawn so you could see a little but it was definitely not light. From what I could make out, it was a guy, a child maybe between 8 and 10 years old. But what I remember most and which scares me to this day is that he had bright red eyes, I'll never forget that sight, damn it. He had managed to drag me a few meters. I took my other foot and kicked him in the stomach as hard as I could, he let go but I also noticed that he was pissed off. I ran as hard as I could, I remember tripping on a rock and then everything went black, until I woke up in the hospital. 

The doctors said that I had been found by a police patrol, the one that had been sent to get me. They had managed to track my mobile and left. When they found me, several pieces of flesh from my body had been bitten off by something. 180 bones were also severed out of the 206 a human body has, had they not come I would be dead by now. It is a miracle that I am alive, I am paralyzed in several parts of my body and will be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life. But I'm glad I'm alive, the police don't believe what I say about the boy, which I can understand. Whatever it was I encountered that night wanted to kill me.
