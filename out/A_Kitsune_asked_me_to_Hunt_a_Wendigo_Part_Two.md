The next few days passed in a strange haze. I called off work, something I almost never did, and spent most of my time getting ready—or at least trying to convince myself I was ready for whatever this was.

When I told Avery, I expected an argument. Or disbelief. Or maybe some concern about me “falling into old habits.” Instead, she just tilted her head, smirked faintly, and said, “Well, I’m going too.”

I didn’t even try to argue. Something about the way she said it made it clear I wouldn’t win, and honestly, part of me was glad. I could tell she didn’t really believe me—about the Kitsune, about the Wendigo, about any of it—but Avery was stubborn in the best way. Whether or not she believed, she was coming.

I spent a lot of time in my office, staring at the shelf where the obsidian chess pieces sat—Naamah’s Queen and Moloch’s King.

I leaned closer, squinting at them as if they might somehow reveal more to me than they already had. Naamah’s powers, the Kitsune had said. Did I really have them? Was I unknowingly pulling something from her when I snared Moloch too?

I picked up the King piece, rolling it between my fingers. It was colder than the Queen, heavier somehow, like it carried something more violent. “Did you leave me anything?” I muttered to it, half-joking.

The King didn’t answer. Of course, it didn’t. It never did.

Still, I wondered.

I spent the rest of the time packing—gear, clothes, notebooks, the essentials for when you’re not entirely sure if you’re going on a hike or heading straight into hell. Avery packed too, probably with more confidence than I had. She tossed things into her bag like she was prepping for a weekend camping trip, not a demon hunt.

Finally, the third day came.

I stayed up late that night, waiting. I don’t know why I expected Kitsune to show up earlier—she didn’t seem like the type to follow normal schedules—but sure enough, as the clock struck midnight, there came a knock at the door.

It wasn’t loud, or hurried. Just a gentle tap-tap-tap, as if the Kitsune had all the time in the world.

Avery glanced at me from across the room, raising an eyebrow. I didn’t say anything as I walked to the door, my pulse quickening.

When I opened it, there she was.

The Kitsune stood upright on her hind legs, tails swishing lightly behind her, a smug grin plastered on her small fox face. She held a stick slung over her shoulder—an old-fashioned “hobo pole,” with a little red cloth bundle tied to the end.

“Right on time,” she said cheerfully. “Told you I’d be back.”

Avery peered over my shoulder, and I braced myself for her to freak out. Instead, she just stared at the Kitsune with wide eyes and said, “That’s… a talking fox.”

Kitsune’s ears perked up, her grin widening. “Yes, I am! And you must be Avery. Glenn’s told me so much about you.”

I shot her a look. “I really haven’t.”

“Details, details.” Kitsune waved a paw dismissively, then tilted her head to get a better look at Avery. “Hmm. I like you already. You’ve got a good vibe. Sassy. Stubborn.”

Avery blinked, clearly still processing. “You’re… smaller than I expected.”

“Rude!” Kitsune gasped, putting a paw to her chest dramatically. Then she grinned again. “But fair.”

Avery’s shock turned into something closer to amusement. “You’re actually a talking fox. Like, real.”

“I get that a lot,” Kitsune replied with a smirk. “And no, I’m not a hallucination. Or a robot. Or a fever dream. I’m as real as you are, sweetheart.”

Avery turned to me, her expression unreadable. “Okay. I’ll admit… I wasn’t expecting that.”

“Now you believe me?” I asked.

She shrugged, slinging her bag over her shoulder. “I mean, yeah. Kind of hard not to when there’s a fox with a hobo stick in our doorway.”

Kitsune snorted. “I like her, Glenn. You should keep her around.”

I sighed, shaking my head. “Are we doing this or not?”

Kitsune’s tails flicked playfully as she turned, already trotting back toward the yard. “Oh, we’re doing this. Pack up, grab your stuff, and let’s get going. The mountains are waiting, and I’d really rather not waste any more time.”

I grabbed my pack, gave the chess pieces one last glance, and followed Avery out into the night.

It felt strange, surreal, like stepping out of my house and into a story that I wasn’t quite ready to tell.

And somewhere in the darkness, I swore I heard faint, distant footsteps that didn’t belong to us.

We got into the car, bags thrown in the trunk, the kind of heavy silence between Avery and me that only comes from diving headfirst into something we weren’t prepared for. Avery climbed into the back without protest, already settling into her seat, while the Kitsune casually hopped into the front passenger side.

“Shotgun!” the little fox declared, tails curling smugly as she perched herself upright like she belonged there.

Avery smirked. “She can have it.”

I glanced at Kitsune. “You don’t even need a seatbelt, do you?”

She grinned, bright and toothy. “I’m magic, Glenn. Seatbelts are for mortals.”

I rolled my eyes, but the faint humor didn’t last long as we pulled out of the driveway. The street was empty, bathed in dim, hazy light from the occasional streetlamp. I adjusted the rearview mirror and kept my focus on the road ahead.

But something made me look back.

In the mirror, standing in the driveway we’d just left, there was… a figure.

I couldn’t make out the details—just a tall, dark silhouette standing perfectly still in the center of the drive. Watching us.

A cold knot twisted in my stomach, and for a moment, I tried to ignore it. I told myself it was just a shadow or a trick of the light. The Kitsune’s antics had my nerves frayed, that’s all.

But then it stepped forward.

Just one step.

I slammed on the brakes, the car screeching to a stop in the middle of the empty road. Avery jolted forward, grabbing the seat in front of her.

“What the hell, Glenn?” she barked.

Kitsune, unfazed, tilted her head. “Something wrong?”

I didn’t answer. My eyes stayed fixed on the figure in the mirror. It hadn’t moved again, but it was still there—clear as day now. It was tall, too tall, its shoulders sharp and hunched. The outline was wrong somehow, like its proportions didn’t quite belong to a person.

“I think we’re being followed,” I muttered, my voice low.

Kitsune turned, standing on the seat to peer out the back window. Her tails swished, ears twitching, as though she could sense something I couldn’t. “Oh.”

“Oh?” I repeated, incredulous.

She turned back to me, her orange eyes narrowing with sudden seriousness. “We should take a look.”

“Take a look?” Avery said, sitting upright. “At what?”

I didn’t respond. My gut told me driving away wouldn’t solve anything—not from this. I took a deep breath, pushed open the door, and stepped out into the night.

The air was cold, heavy, as though the world was holding its breath. Avery got out behind me, though I could hear the frustration in her footsteps, and Kitsune followed with an unsettling calm, hopping down lightly onto the pavement.

I turned toward the house.

The figure was still there, standing motionless in my driveway. It hadn’t moved. It hadn’t spoken.

But it was watching.

Avery stepped up beside me. “Glenn… what is that?”

I didn’t have an answer.

We stood there, the three of us, staring into the dark, as the figure stared back.

We stood frozen, the world wrapped in a silence so thick I could hear the faint ringing in my ears. The figure didn’t move, but I could feel its gaze—like the weight of a stone pressing against my chest.

“Glenn,” Avery whispered, her voice wavering just slightly. “What… is it?”

I couldn’t answer.

Kitsune, however, padded forward without a hint of fear, her small paws barely making a sound against the pavement. Her tails swished, their movements unnervingly calm. She tilted her head toward the figure, and in the faint light, I swore I saw her roll her eyes.

“Oh, for the love of—” Kitsune muttered, exasperated.

The figure twitched. Its head tilted to one side—a sudden, jerky movement like a puppet whose strings had been pulled too tight.

I swallowed, forcing myself to step forward. “Hey,” I called out, my voice steadier than I felt. “Who are you? What do you want?”

The figure swayed—barely perceptible—then took a step toward us. Up close, it was even worse. It was tall, gangly, its limbs too thin and long, its silhouette rippling like a mirage. Its clothing, tattered and dark, clung to its thin frame like it was stitched into place. But the worst part was its face.

At first, there was nothing—only shadows where features should be. But then, as it leaned forward slightly, the darkness peeled away to reveal eyes. Large, round, glowing faintly like lanterns—soft and childlike.

The rest of the face was faint, pale as porcelain, like it was unfinished.

“Glenn,” Avery muttered, tugging my sleeve. “Let’s just go.”

I ignored her. The figure stopped a few paces away, staring. Watching.

“Who are you?” I asked again, this time softer.

The figure twitched, its shoulders rising and falling in what almost seemed like a shudder. Then it spoke.

“I… I brought something for you…”

The voice was faint, trembling, and small. Not like a monster at all—like a scared child whispering in the dark.

The figure’s hands—long and bony—reached forward, cradling something carefully. I tensed, ready for anything, but the motion was hesitant, uncertain.

“I don’t want to hurt you,” I said gently, my own fear giving way to something… else. “What did you bring me?”

It took a small, timid step forward and stretched out its hands. In them was a small object—a figurine, carved delicately from stone. I hesitated, glancing at Kitsune, who didn’t seem alarmed, just annoyed.

“Take it,” she muttered. “Honestly, Glenn, you’re making this so dramatic.”

I swallowed and stepped closer. The figure flinched slightly, like it expected me to lash out. Slowly, I extended my hand and took the object.

It was a small statue of a horse, carved from smooth, cool stone. Its details were fine—graceful curves, a hint of motion frozen in its posture. Despite its simplicity, it felt… important.

“It’s for you,” the figure whispered again. “It’ll help. You’ll see.”

I looked back at the figure, its pale, faint face watching me with something like hope. “Why?” I asked softly.

The figure’s head twitched again, its voice smaller now. “Because… because I’m scared. It’s coming. The hungry thing in the mountains. It hurts everything.”

“The Wendigo,” I murmured, realization sinking in.

The figure nodded, its glowing eyes wide and fearful. “It smells like cold. It eats everything.”

I glanced back at Kitsune, who yawned dramatically. “Yes, yes, we know about the Wendigo,” she said, tail flicking. “That’s why we’re going, Selsie. You can go now.”

“Selsie?” I echoed, looking between the fox and the spirit.

“That’s its name,” Kitsune replied flatly. “Or at least, close enough.”

The figure—Selsie—straightened slightly at hearing its name. “Thank you,” it whispered, almost too faint to hear. Then it stepped back, swaying like a leaf caught in the breeze.

“Go on, now,” Kitsune said, her voice surprisingly soft. “You’ve done enough.”

Selsie turned, its movements slow and uneven, and began to walk away. Its silhouette grew smaller and smaller, disappearing into the shadows beyond the yard.

The silence that followed felt heavier somehow, like the world was catching its breath.

Avery let out a long exhale. “What… the hell was that?”

I didn’t answer right away. I stared down at the horse statue in my hands, its smooth surface oddly warm. Despite everything, I felt calm holding it. Protected, almost.

Avery shook her head. “I don’t know what’s crazier—that thing… or how you just stood there talking to it like you weren’t scared.”

I turned to look at her, surprised. “I was terrified.”

She smirked faintly, though I could tell it wasn’t quite steady. “Could’ve fooled me.”

As she turned back to the car, Kitsune hopped onto the pavement beside me. She tilted her head up at me, her grin smug and knowing.

“You’re welcome for the bravery,” she said.

I rolled my eyes. “That wasn’t you.”

“Sure, sure,” she replied, tails curling playfully. “Keep telling yourself that.”

I sighed, sliding the horse figurine carefully into my pocket before turning back to the car. Whatever Selsie was—whatever it meant—I had a feeling we were going to need this little gift sooner than I’d like.
