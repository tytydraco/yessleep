Hi, before I start this, I want you to know that I believe in paranormal experiences but also I am pretty skeptical of these things. Also, I want to add that I’m an avid hiker and tend to do hikes by myself and have done this specific trail 2 times before. I pride myself on knowing everything that is around me at all times.

I would like to add I had a 3 gallon water pack with me and had already eaten lunch for the day. I am not anemic or have any problems with low blood sugar. And I was not dehydrated. I do not suffer from panic attacks or any other mental disabilities except for ADHD. 

Today I thought that I would go for an easy but long hike (12 miles to be exact). I had the day off from work and wanted to really enjoy it. I went to Jennings State Forest in North Florida, the Pioneer Trail to be exact. the first hour and a half was really calm. Not a lot of people out only passed maybe one person on the trail. 

I then got to the river that the trail goes alongside and chilled out there for a while. Everything was really normal. Birds were out and frogs were croaking as normal. 

 I then went up the little foothill (approximately 5 miles into the trail) and then all of a sudden I hear what sounds like tongue clicking all around me and the feeling of being extremely watched. Plus no more noise from the animals and the forest got really dense and dark. I did my absolute best to scan the area around me. No animals were visible or people.

I really tried to brush it off as the clicking had stopped. To add I do keep a firearm with me on my hikes as i am trained to carry. I figured if anything it was in my head and I was fine. So I kept pushing on because I really wanted to get the most out of this hike. About five minutes later, I found myself extremely disoriented, which is more than very unusual for me. 

in detail, I felt extremely clammy in the hands and all over. I couldn’t see anything in front of me. I was so disoriented. I grabbed my gun with my left hand (I’m a right handed person). I was very close to just ringing out a shot because I thought that this is my last moment here. The only way I can describe it was I felt like I was on the brink of falling into a dream or maybe a different reality. 

The path was extremely easy to see yet, I had no idea where I was and still felt extremely watched. I had to sit down or else I would’ve fallen over. I felt as though i had been drugged (which was not the case).

Then all of a sudden the clicking started again, and I became even more disoriented, couldn’t catch my breath, worse than any disassociation possible. I’ve never felt like my life was in more of a threat. I felt as though I had crossed over into a different place. Everything became blurred. The trees around me were no longer visible. All I could do is feel that I was holding my gun. 

The next moment I knew I had to leave. I had to get out of there. Completely disoriented I started running right back down the trail into what I thought was the right way. Since the beginning of my disorientation, I hadn’t moved off trail, so I had a pretty good idea of how far I had to turn to run back trail. 

I started running falling, tripping. Until I could tell, I got down the mountain. As I got down the mountain, I came back to my senses. I kinda looked at where I had come from and then I sprinted for another 10 minutes. I tried to call anybody I knew, but my cell had no reception. 

Finally, my phone connected, and I got in touch with a family member who I recounted the whole thing to. I was out of breath and in a complete state of shock. I spent so much time in the woods and I’ve never had anything like this happen to me. Never have I felt like my life was in such danger, my whole life flash before my eyes.

 I can’t seem to explain what sounded like (human) tongue clicking all around me. It felt almost hallucinating.  I walked it off, and once I finally got out of the woods I still felt loopy and disoriented. 

Any ideas? I have heard of missing 411 in the past and people said it may line up with that. Let me know if you need any more details or if you’re interested. 
Thank you and sorry for the spelling.
