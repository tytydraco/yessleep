Once upon a time, there was a boy named Tim. All skin and bone, he was incredibly thin. Sickly and frail, his skin sallow and pale. Everyone prayed for good health and wished he'd get well. But the day would soon come and he would finally die. His parents would wail, they would scream and they'd cry. Without money for the treatments, they could not save his life. And mean old Mr. Morgan, would rather be dead than ever part with a dime..

​

Bob Padgett, was a tough cookie. And as far as underpaid clerks go, he was the best at what he did. As much as he hated who he did it for, he really didn't have another option. Work was hard to come by, and steady jobs were nearly impossible to find. He toiled on without a single complaint, counting and recording the miserly scrooge' fortune, all the way to the bank.

​

The day before Christmas eve, Bob would ask for an advance. Even though he knew the scrooge all too well, and of that there was hardly a chance. Though it *was* nearly Christmas, and had *never* asked before, The scrooge, shot down the question with no more than a grunt and a glance. "Bah!", and "Humbug!", he exclaimed, as he stared at the flames. The wood in the fireplace it crackled and hissed, and Mr. Morgan grunted out another, "Hmphf", yet again.

​

The shadow that was cast, as he rocked back and forth in his favorite chair, was long and quite wicked, it held on to the chill that hung in the air. But the only monster here, was the one hunched forward and sat in it's chair . I pulled tight the ribbons and closed tight the books, and before we could leave he gave me that look. Again with the scowl, and that subzero glance from just above the rims of his wire-framed spectacles. "Humbug I say!", Morgan said, with much more fervor this time, as he began to rise up from his warm oaken throne.

​

He reached out for the wall, grasping for his coat and scarf from decoratively engraved, wall-mounted hangers. He retrieved his hat from the top of his desk, briskly slapping across the top of it, ridding it of any cumulative dust. His last acquisition before heading for the door, for Mr. Morgan, was his cane. Long, tapered, and black as a moonless night, topped with a decorative silver handle.

​

By the time Mr. Morgan had made it to the door one elderly step after another. Bob had hurried along and doused the fire, tidied up his work station, and beat him to the door. Holding it open for him, all the Christmas killjoy had to do was step his way through the open doorway, and out onto the snow covered walkway. He held back his tall black hat from being blown free of his frail old head. The bitter Easterly wind blowing hard through the streets kicked up wisps of snow, some gusts even blew themselves up into small dwarf sized little snow devils.

​

Bob, pulled the door shut and locked it behind them. He followed after the old man until they reached his flat. A three storied mansion of a flat, empty most times, aside from the old mans shuffling foot falls. It was quite literally just next door. Only a couple shops stood between his business office and the door to his flat. After a couple rejected pleasantries and the slamming of the flat door in his face. Bob only made it a few steps before absolutely falling apart. He broke down and wailed at the walls between buildings like a madman. Pounding on the rust colored brick surface until his hands were all but mashed.

​

He made it home and inside without stirring any of the children. His wife though she was up waiting for him. With a glint of hope in her eyes, she had been waiting up in the hopes that her husband would come home with great news. At the site of his scabbed over knuckles and bloody fingers, she began to weep falling over into her pillow to hide the sounds of her caterwauling. The sounds of her muffled sobs were replaced by the sounds of rasp, rough, coughing from the room adjacent to their own. In this room, five of their six children slept. And Martha had recently come down with an awful cold and cough. Both of the parents leapt from the room to the sounds. But they did not turn to the left for the room that slept five of their children. They turned to the right, quietly, mother and father peering through the open doorway.

​

They looked in on the low flames and glowing embers of their next to last fire. They would need to figure out more wood tomorrow, they both thought this at the exact same moment in time. Then they moved their combined gazes to the pallet they had made there just near the fire. Where the warmth and comfort was the greatest they had to offer in the Padgett household. It was the only place in the house you couldn't see your breath. There on the floor laid little Timmy. Tim was a good boy. But having to walk with a crutch most of his young life and being deathly ill half the same, he didn't have a bright disposition. He lay still, breathing softly, but steadily, his face red with fever and his eyelids a hollow purplish color. Covers up to his collarbone and a warm rag on his forehead.

​

Mom retrieved the rag without waking him. Probably because he's weak, probably because she had done this a thousand times and by now it was done with the grace of a Samurai Butterfly. She replaced it with another she had waved through the air a few times to cool down. They returned to their room, and within minutes they were both hard asleep. Bob had the most bizarre dream of his life that night, something to do with shadows, and losing something he couldn't find no matter how hard he ever looked.

​

He awoke with the start of his life too. At first wail he didn't know for sure what t was or what had woke him with such a sudden jolt. But a few seconds later, dear old mom had caught a second breath. And it must of been the deepest she had drawn in her entire life, because the length and pitches of the scream that followed, ripped the heart right out of Bob' chest like a rubber band stretched back a mile and let loose. The way it snapped back in his throat instantly triggered his gag reflex. He vomited next to the bed and jumped to his feet landing in his own mess and slipping to the floor. He looked as his disgusting hands as he got back to his feet.

​

He knew before he got there, brushing past his two oldest on the way. But the reality didn't hit until his eyes landed on his wife, draped over the dead body of their youngest child. Tim had died in his sleep on Christmas Eve. A few hours later Mr. Morgan sat at his desk, doing his best impressions of a turtle, trying to pull his head and neck down into his shoulders. Just outside the doors, the sound of Bob breaking down through the worst moments he would likely ever live through, struck him over and over again. A half-hearted broken sound followed closely by a thump on the doors or the storefront. And Mr. Morgan knew, their son, "What was the name?", he thought to himself, must have finally died. He didn't understand all the fuss though, "It was an expected death, wasn't it?", "He would give Bob the day", he decided, to grieve if he need, to make preparations.

​

That night, Morgan would have the worst nightmare of his life. He woke with such a start he thought he may be the next one to earn the undertaker a dime. What was it? Something about shadows? And losing something he would certainly never be able to find. The next thing he was certain of was that he could of sworn he saw something out the corner of his eye. Through the sheer, almost invisible, cloth bug-netting around his bed, he thought he saw something go past his bedchamber door.

​

A shadow..

​

I am the entity. I came in the form of another. There in the doorway stood a monster. It had to be a monster because Tim was dead. Yet there he stood, unmistakably hobbled and leaning on his crutch. No more than darkness in the shape of a young boy, silhouetted in the doorway. And stretched out across the bedchamber floor before him, the shadow. But not the shadow of a boy, it was the shadow of a pointed hulking monster. Black as night and dominating the floor space, the shadow of something horrible. something wrong.

​

The slamming of the door to Mr. Morgan' bedchamber was heard by the closest neighbors that night. One of them said they thought for sure they had heard a scream in the night, around the same time they had heard the loud crashing sound of a door being splintered on it's frame. The next morning they noticed the police presence.

​

Mr. Morgan had been discovered Christmas morning, by his nephew Frederick. He had come to try and convince the old axe to come to Christmas dinner, even though his pleadings fell on deaf ears every year. He still liked to see his grumpy uncle on Christmas, even if he was turning him down on his invitation to dinner every year. His annual visit this year was the surprise of a lifetime. And at the same time, without a doubt the worst thing he would probably ever lay his eyes on.

​

The sight of Mr. Morgan was abhorred and terrifying. His jaw slung open and distended, open far wider than humanly possible without a complete dislocation of the jaw. His tongue lay out over the side of a cheek, his hands wrenched tight with two fists full of his sleep top. It gave the instant impression that he had been scared to death. Frightened so deeply and so completely that the scream would dislocate his own jaw and his heart would fail. The police captain and the medical examiner would not know what to make of it. The death certificate would read natural causes, a heart attack.

​

I wanted to share one of my favorite stories with all of you. I am the shadow and I am not a man. And sometimes a universal injustice must be undone, or perhaps it was a universal justice be done. Either way I hope you enjoyed the story! Sweet dreams to all and to all a good night..
