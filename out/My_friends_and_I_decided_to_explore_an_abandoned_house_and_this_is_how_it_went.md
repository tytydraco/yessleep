A bunch of drunk people near an abandoned place known for all the mysteries surrounding it, what could go wrong?

My friends and I were across the street from the abandoned terrain known for all the missing people who never came back after entering through those spiky gates, and what else would we be there for other than going inside?

As the last of us jumped from the top of that gate, we finally managed to get a good look at what awaited us.

All the dead plants in the garden, all the broken windows, all the graffities that seemed to be the only form of color coming through this place disconnected from reality for who knows how long

That should have been all that was needed to make anyone get back right from where they came from. But not us, apparently...

As we creeped closer to the main entrance, it seemed as if the sounds we could before hear coming from all the streets nearby, slowly got lower and lower, coming to a complete stop as soon as someone grabbed the doorknob.

After we opened the door, with all our flashlights, we finally got a look inside that strange building, and to our surprise, the house was brand new from the inside. Altho it seemed as if it had never left the 18th century, it was surprisingly pleasant.

That gave us all the courage that we needed to keep on pressing forward, uncovering everything that house had to offer.

We kept on going from what seemed hours, door after door, corridor after corridor, but after a while we were not even concerned any more by the size of this house, that seemed honestly infinite, we were starting to get concerned with the changing scenario, and the weird atmosphere that somehow after every turn managed to get even more horrifying

we went from an 18th century house, to what seemed more of a church, and then to some kind of fabric, and now we could see ourselves walking through what seems like a tunnel. Why a tunnel, you may ask. That is because we have not seen anything new for a while now. Just the concave brick walls with no walls for what seems like forever.

Slowly, our flashlights died, one by one, leaving us in complete darkness. We all gathered around our smoker friend, that now had the only source of light in his hand, his lighter. We were in discussion what to do. Some of us wanted to try going back, "but wait, haven't we already turned before?" "What? We were walking in a straight line, when would we have turned dumbass?" "No, he is right, I remember that at some point we did turn around because we were getting tired", and just like that a discussion broke out on what direction we had actually headed up to this point.

Unfortunately for us, that discussion didn't last long, because we only now noticed the dry bloody handprints on the wall.

Panic took over, nobody was able to discuss anything anymore.

We picked a direction and started running, but no matter how long we ran for, nothing changed.

Slowly, the panic was being substituted by the sense of dread, and after a while there was no hope anymore. "Give up dude, it's useless, we are stuck here. There is no escape" said one of our friends, as he sat on the ground, "if you guys want, you can go without me, but I'm not wasting my time walking forever.". "I can't take anymore, just leave me here, I don't want to walk anymore" said another one of our friends after a while, as she sat on the ground with a desolated face.

Slowly, each one of that group had decided to be left behind, there was no end in sight, and no reason to have any sort of hope.

My last friend told me, "this wasn't the way I was planning to go, but I just won't walk anymore. There is nothing more for us, you should give up as well, or you will die walking"

I honestly never had actual hope on finding an exit, but after a lot more of walking, the scenery started changing again.

I saw it all again, I saw the end of the tunnel, the fabric, the church, and finally I reached that 18th century scenario once more.

I could not believe my eyes. I had finally reached the entrance.

opposing all my soul was telling me, I had to go back for my friends, but after I got through the fabric scenery, there was no tunnel anymore...

what was before an infinite path surrounded by a concave brick wall, now wasn't more than a few meters deep, with a brick wall by the end.

I could not believe it. 

as I made my way once again to the entrance, completely alone, I was questioning everything that had happened up to this point. people don't simply disappear like that, but they simply vanished.

I reached the main door, surrounded by the 18th century theme, and as I grabbed the doorknob, all the outside noise suddenly reappeared.

as the sun burned my eyes, i closed the door behind me, and jumped the gate to finally get over that nightmare.

and that is how that exploration went...
