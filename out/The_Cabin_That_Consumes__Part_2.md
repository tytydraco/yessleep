It was the bed.

It hadn't moved or anything, but on it laid a piece of paper, folded in half. It looked like a page from a book.

"You guys see that?"

The guys didn't reply with words. Instead, I got my answer from the look on Brandon's face. He was shocked. Like he couldn't believe what he was looking at.

"Yo, Brandon. You there?" I asked.

He quickly snaps out of his daze and looks at me.

"Uh, yeah sorry. I just don't remember that being there yesterday." he says, voice trembling.

"Yeah, because it wasn't."

Jake let out an annoyed sigh and made his way toward the bed. "It... looks like a page from a Bible or something, but I don't recognize this language?" He picked it up and opened it and just a second after he did, a drop of fresh blood dripped from the page, onto the floor.

"Is that what I think it is?" Brandon asked, a terrified look on his face.

"Guys... look." Jake flipped the page our way, revealing the word 'LEAVE' written on it in a very sloppy handwriting. "It's, probably just some homeless gu-"

I cut him off "No, man! We can't keep saying it's a homeless person! Have you ever seen a homeless guy in \[REDACTED\]? Because I haven't! I've lived here my whole life and can't recall every seeing anybody go homeless!"

Jake dropped the paper, a confused look on his face. He knew I was right, but didn't want to face the truth. "And this... wasn't one of you? Like, playing a prank or something?"

"A prank? Dude, when was the last time any of us pranked each other? And if I did, I wouldn't do some weird shit like this." "Do you guys want to just do this tomorrow? I'm not really in the mood today, honestly."

Brandon finally spoke. "Yeah, I think that's enough for one day. Fake or not, I do not like that note."

So, we hopped into my car, and blasted rock music, trying to drown out the voices in our head pestering us with thoughts of what we had just witnessed.

I had finally begun to think of something else when Jake spoke. "That blood, or paint, or whatever it was, was... really fresh. I mean, it was wet enough to drip on the ground."

A violent shiver went down my spine. I didn't know what to say. Finally, Brandon broke the silence. "How long do you think it was there for? And was it meant for us?"

We didn't want to talk about it, but it was the only thing we could think about, so we sat in silence the rest of the trip.

The next day at lunch, I grabbed my food and made my way toward our usual table. When I got there Brandon put down his burger to speak. "Okay, now that you're both here, I want to talk about what happened yesterday."

"Okay?" I say, already not liking where this is going.

"I took a picture of the page that we found and showed it to my mom. She said the language was Latin. She actually has an old small Bible in Latin, she showed it to me. She said everybody in this town has been handing them down to their first-born kids for generations."

"Really? Jake, are either of your parents the oldest sibling?" I ask.

"No, I don't think so. You have an uncle that's older than your mom, right?" Jake asks.

"Yeah, we don't talk to him much, though. He works a ton."

"Look, all I'm saying is that a Bible in Latin isn't a weird thing around here, okay?" Brandon blurts out.

"Okay, yeah. And what about the wet blood then?"

"It's fake blood, man! I asked my mom, and she said that Stan's sells fake blood around Halloween. She showed me some that she bought a few years ago when I wanted to be a zombie." he replied, his tone implying that it should've been obvious.

"Okay, sure. Even if that's true, why was it fresh enough to drip? Are these people following us out there to do this crap?"

"Yeah... I can't explain that part. I didn't get much sleep last night." As soon as Jake got done speaking, the bell rang.

The next few days were very productive. We didn't get any more footage, but we got most of our editing done. We didn't even really bring up going back out there. Unable to process everything, we shied away from the unknown.

It was the final week of our project, and we had edited everything that we had shot. We were stuck unless we went back out there. We all agreed to it and made our way there after school.

"Let's just get this started already. We barely got anything done last time we were out here." Jake whined, as we pulled up to the cabin. We grabbed just the essentials and fought our way through the tall weeds once more.

We did some retakes, and I walked around pointing out anything that looked odd while I slowly created this fictional serial killer.

We had just finished up a take and Jake asks "I think we're good in here. Could we possibly get some shots of the exterior?"

The sun was just about to go down, so we wrapped things up and started doing a lap around the outside. When we got to the back, we noticed something.

A basement door.

Like, one of those where you gotta lift the doors up. How had we not noticed that yet? This place was already pretty creepy, so I was afraid of how much creepier this basement might be.

"Oh shit!" Jakes shouts from behind us, making me jump. "You guys down to go in there?"

"If we want a good movie, we gotta get some shots down there! That could be where the killings took place!" Brandon says, as they both made their way towards the doors.

"Wait, guys! Are you sure this is a good idea?"

Brandon turns to me. "What's the matter, Dylan? Are you afraid?" he says in a mocking tone.

"Don't you guys remember the note that was here last time? Doesn't it concern you at all that whoever left that behind might be down there?"

Jake walks up to me, putting a hand on my shoulder. "Hey man, relax. You're right. Things have been pretty weird but think of how awesome a quick shot down there would be! We could prop both doors open to let some light in, okay?"

I look down, face in my hand and let out a sigh. I really didn't want to do this, but I knew the guys wouldn't let it go now. This place was my idea after all, and I knew that they would probably bring that up.

"Look, guys. It's starting to get dark. Could we just do this part tomorrow?" I asked, praying my friends would agree. Maybe doing it right after school will make things a little less creepy. And besides, I don't feel like meeting whoever left that really creepy note behind last time.

"That's not a bad idea. I'm freezing my ass off, too! So, remember to bring a jacket tomorrow!" Brandon says, shutting the camera off.

"Yeah, okay. That's probably smart." Jake agrees.

We all climbed into my car and made our way home.

If I could go back in time and stop us right here, I would.

The next day was a typical day. Coasting though all of the boring stuff, waiting for last period. Thinking of ideas for the movie really helped to pass the time though. We spent most of class that day editing. We talked a little about ideas for the basement, but decided we could do that in the car later.

Jake had me stop at another gas station in town that day, just a little out of our way because someone at school told him that they don't ask for ID. I don't think it was true though because he came out with a Red Bull and a look of disappointment on his face. He climbs in the car, looking defeated.

"Let me guess. They carded you?"

"Obviously they carded me, man! She didn't even scan the thing. She was just glaring at me, like it was obvious or something!"

"Of course it's obvious, Jake. You're eighteen, and you look fourteen!" I say, joking. I heard Brandon laugh from the backseat while Jake sipped from his Red Bull, probably hoping we'll just drop it. I put some music on, and we headed towards the house.

We got there and made our way toward the back. There it was again. As we passed the front of the house, I noticed it hanging there. It was identical to the little thing Jake stomped on a couple weeks back.

"Okay, what the hell? You guys remember me breaking that thing, right?" Jake says, as he notices it.

"I don't like that. This is getting way too weird you guys." Brandon says, petrified.

Without saying a word, I made my way toward the object. As I approached it, I looked down. The other one was still there, broken and untouched. Was it better or worse that they left this one alone? I wasn't sure. I felt sick to my stomach.

Jake walks passed me and pushed the front door open. Freezing in his tracks, right there in the doorway. I noticed the look on his face and decided I should see whatever he was looking at.

It was the wall this time.

The word 'LEAVE' accompanied by phrases of Latin and more of the symbols, written on the wall across from us. It was just as fresh as the note, with visible drips making their way down the wall from each sloppy letter.

"How much more of this shit can we blame on kids? They have to be some pretty fucked up kids if they're doing stuff like this! If this is a joke or something, they've taken it way too far!" Jake finally says his voice trembling.

"I don't think kids are doing this. We need to figure out what these symbols are. They're everywhere."

We took some pictures, and decided it was probably best to do something else. I think we were too on edge to do any shooting that day, especially if the guys still felt like exploring the basement. So, I dropped them off and spent the night looking into the mysterious symbols we kept running in to.

It was almost midnight before I realized the time. I felt like someone was messing with us, because I couldn't find anything on them. I didn't know what was more believable, that someone made up all of this up, or that we actually happened to stumble upon an unknown language in this small cabin, just outside of an isolated logging town.

The guys didn't have any luck either. We spent lunch figuring out a plan for that night. We decided the library might have a book on it. We looked through everyone they had on languages, ancient civilizations, just anything we could think of that may be relevant.

"Guys... I just translated the Latin we found on the wall." Brandon says, an uncomfortable look on his face.

"What does it say?"

"The longest one translated to 'If you visit this place, where the creature dwells, you'll be sacrificed and sent to hell."

"That's... fun." I say, nervously. I've never heard anything so creepy before in my life.

"This doesn't make any freaking sense.!" Jake finally says, annoyed.

"What?"

"Any of it! None of this make sense, man! If is this real, how the hell did a language manage to hide from human history in freaking rural \[REDACTED\], and now this too?" he says frustrated, trying to remain quiet.

"Excuse me, gentlemen." we hear from behind us. "The library is closing in a couple of minutes. You are going to have to leave soon."

We were running out of ideas. It was like this language didn't exist. But how was that possible? Nothing can hide from the internet nowadays, yet these symbols managed to do so.

I dropped them off and made my way home. I didn't sleep that night. I tried, I just... couldn't. Something about that mystery language, hidden from history all these years, scared the crap out of me. And that message? What was that about?

The guys were unusually quiet at lunch the next day, but I don't blame them. I didn't feel like talking much myself. I couldn't stop thinking about the message on the wall. Brandon and Jake couldn't either. We spent the next couple of days editing. I think it was just to put off having to go back out to that place.

We were almost done, but didn't have enough to fill an hour. This was a big problem because none of us wanted to go back there. And an even bigger problem? Were almost out of time, so we had to finish this thing. It was too late to start a new project.

"Eight minutes." Jake says, looking at our movie in the editing software. "Eight freaking minutes."

Eight minutes can feel like an eternity when you're as uncomfortable as we were last time we visited that place. We didn't have a choice though. We needed to finish this project.

"Eight minutes isn't so bad, right? We could go right after school and get it done. If you don't mess up, we could be in and out in like fifteen minutes." Brandon says. I think he was trying to be funny, but it wasn't working.

"Even after everything we've seen? You guys aren't worried at all about what we saw last time?"

They both looked at me. It was a dumb idea, but I knew we'd end up doing it anyways. We had to finish this project. It was a big part of our grade and would be the first "official" film we ever made.

They spent the rest of the period trying to convince me, and I eventually cracked and said yes. We were all scared, but deep down I think we felt the same way, just excited to see our film completed.

After class, we headed straight for the car. We didn't talk much on the way there. I don't know about them, but I was terrified of what we may find this time. My mind felt like it was going a million miles an hour, running through every possibility of what may be waiting for us out there.

It took me a couple of minutes to get out of the car. Killing the engine as we pulled up, I sit there trying to justify another trip out to this place. I didn't know it yet, but this would be the last day of my friends' lives.

"Hey, man. Are you ready to get this over with?" Jake says, a look of concern on his face.

I sat there for another second or so, mustering up the courage to open the car door. "Yeah, I think I'm good now. Let me just grab something real quick."

I pop the trunk and head to the back of the car. As the guys got the cameras ready, I grabbed a couple of small crowbars. I knew it wasn't much, but I felt the need to buy something to defend myself after our last trip out here. They might make the guys feel better, too. I hand one to Brandon and put the other one in the side pocket of my backpack.

"Just in case."

"Just in case of what?" Brandon says, confused. "What do you expect to happen today?"

"After our last few trips out here? I'm not really sure what to expect any more if I'm being honest. Better safe than sorry, I guess though."

Brandon's face changed almost immediately after I said that. He looked so uncomfortable. I can't blame him though, I felt the same way, I think I was just doing a better job of hiding it.

We stood there in silence for a bit and then made our way towards the back of the house. I noticed that thing was still hanging by the front door. That's probably a good sign, right? It means nobody has been out here since we were here last. We made it to the back and noticed something on the basement doors, a giant 'X' and a couple of the symbols we kept seeing.

"Of course, man! We can't go one freaking time without finding something weird, can we?" Jake says, already getting tired of this.

"Let's just leave. We can find something else to fill in those eight minutes!"

"Dude, don't you remember? We basically left off in the middle of a scene. We have to finish this thing here or it isn't going to look right." Brandon says, looking at Jake, waiting for him to agree.

"He's right. We only need eight minutes. Let's just get it done and get out of here. We'll be on our way home in 15 minutes, dude." Jake says to me, hoping to change my mind.

I stared at them for a while in disbelief. Did they really want to go down there for a school project?

"Can't we finish it up inside the house? There's gotta be something else we can talk about in there."

"We have an hour of content from that small shack. That's enough! And besides, they'll want to see the basement if we mention it to anyone." Jake says, still hoping to win me over.

"So then don't mention it to anyone! I don't want to go down in that death trap!" I yell.

Jake let's out a deep sigh and looks at me. "Would it make you feel better if I went down there and checked it out? I got the light on my phone. Besides, I doubt it that's big."

He wasn't going to drop it. They were going to finish this thing in that basement, with or without me. I decided that if they were going down there, I was going to join them. I've known these guys my whole life, and if I left now and something happened to them? The guilt would kill me.

I stood there, looking at the ground. Silent. I wanted to prolong this moment as long as I possibly could. We had no idea what we were about to see, and that terrified me. I really wish I could've talked the guys out of it.

"Well, want me to check it out real quick?" Jake asks, after giving me a few minutes of think.

I take a deep breath in, and let out a large, exaggerated exhale. I needed Jake to know that I thought this was a bad idea.

"Just... be careful, Jake. Please. I got a bad feeling about this place."

Jake remained calm and collected, or he looked that way, at least. I know he was probably shitting bricks right about now. He nodded to us and set his backpack on the ground. Handing me the camera, he pulled his phone from his pocket with the other hand.

"Seriously guys, don't worry. I'll be fine. Would it make you feel better if I called you so we could talk while I'm down there?"

Brandon and I looked at each other, knowing this would probably help calm us down a bit.

"Yeah, sure. I like that idea. You can tell us what you see." I say, speaking for both of us.

We made our way over and took one final glance at each other. Brandon and Jake each grab a door and pull them open. I think we found the source of that awful smell, because it was a lot worse down here.

I thank God I was standing that far away, because they practically stuck their faces into it. The smell was so strong they both stumbled backwards, Jake falling on his ass.

"Oh my god!" Jake yells, nearly vomiting.

"I didn't think that smell could get any worse!" Brandon yells, now covering his face with his shirt.

I helped Jake up, and Brandon grabbed his phone. He must've tossed it when he fell.

"Thanks" he says.

"No problem. Do you really feel like going in there still, though?"

Jake stared at me for a bit. I could tell he was thinking.

"Do you still have your gym clothes in your car?"

"Umm.. yeah?" I say, confused by where this might be going.

"Get me your shirt. I'd appreciate it if it didn't stink like BO." he says, with a smirk on his face.

"A little BO after gym class is normal! Besides, it beats those Axe baths you take. It's like you're trying to bug bomb the locker room everyday, or something!"

Brandon let out a small laugh, and Jake sat silent. He'd never admit it, but I think even he knew that I had won this one. I walked to my car and grabbed a clean gym shirt. When I got back Jake had a YouTube tutorial up, teaching him how to tie the shirt around his face like a ninja mask. He insisted that it was going to help, but I had my doubts.

He got it on and called my phone. Brandon and I remained right next to the door as he climbed down into what looked like a black void. Jake was very brave, because I would never go down there alone.

"Holy shit, it is so freaking dark down here!" he says, just a second after we heard his feet hit the ground through my phone.

"It took you a while to get down there. How far down do you think it is?"

"I'm not sure. But it's gotta be pretty far down because it is pitch black in here! Look down!"

Brandon and I stick our heads in, spotting Jake's phone light. He was right, it was probably twenty-five feet down. I've never seen a basement this deep. Brandon and I sat there, waiting for him to say something.

"You see anything yet, Jake?"

"No. It's pretty creepy, but I'm not seeing anything too crazy." He's quiet for a second and then speaks again. "Woah, okay. I think I found something. It looks like.. an altar, maybe?"

"An altar? You think you just found an altar in this basement?" I say in disbelief.

"Guys.. this place is huge." he says, completely ignoring my question, sounding terrified.

"How big could it possibly be?"

"I'm scared to find out. It looks like there's a whole church down here!"

"Okay dude, you're starting to freak me out! Just get out of there so we can leave!"

"I'm serious man. I found bathrooms, an altar and like four rows of pews."

"Come on Jake, just get out of there! I don't like this!"

I stuck my head inside the doors, but he was too far away. I couldn't hear anything. How big was this place?

"I wish there was some freaking lights down here! It's like walking around in a Walmart with a blindfold on!"

The silence was broken by loud thuds and the sound of wood breaking over my phone.

"You alright, Jake?"

"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just.." We hear another loud thud followed by a grunt. "Trying to kick this door down!" he replies.

"What? Why? I'd leave it alone, I doubt that's the way out!"

"Got any better ideas? Because I'm fucking lost dude! It's been at least five minutes since I've seen the ladder!"

Trying to be quick, I come up with an idea. "Hey Jake! Just look for my light, okay? I'm going to stick my phone down there and wave it around. Keep an eye out for it!"

As I turned my light on, we heard one more thud. It was followed by what sounded like a two by four snapping.

"I got it, guys! I got the door open!" Jake yells, an odd amount of excitement in his voice.

"Leave that door alone! I don't want you to get even more lost! Just look for my light, man. Please!"

I stick the top half of my body down into the hole, trying to give Jake the best possible chance of seeing me. As I waved the light around, I yelled his name, but he could only hear my voice over the phone.

That comparison he made to Walmart creeped back into my memory and I became terrified with the possibility of how big this place might actually be.

How were we going to get him out? He couldn't see us, and he could only hear us over the phone. He must have been a ways in too because his phone was starting to occasionally cut out.

"What was that?" Jake randomly yells, terrified.

"What is it!? What do you see, Jake!?"

"I don't see anything! But I'm hearing shit!" he says in a soft tone, almost as if he's trying to whisper.

"What did it sound like?"

"Like.. a really low growl, kind of. It sounded pissed off! And.. oh my god! Oh my god! I can hear it again! It sounds close! I'm gonna crawl under this over-turned pew!"

He was right. The growl was a hauntingly low, guttural growl. It eventually went away, followed by rustling and the labored breathing of our best friend. He was silent for a bit. It could've been seconds, or minutes, all I know, is it felt like an eternity.

He finally spoke. "Guys! I haven't heard anything for a bit. I'm going to look around and see if I can find that door I came in!"

Jake peaks out from under the pew.

"I don't see anything, you guys. I'm gonna look for that door!"

He sits up, when he suddenly feels something cold drip from above and land in his hair.

"What.. was.. that?"

And before we could respond, Jake looked up hoping to find the source when another drop landed on his upper lip, most of it getting into his mouth.

"Oh my god! Oh my god! It's blood! A drop just fell into my mouth and it tastes like fucking dirty pennies!" he shouts.

"Relax, Jake! You have to keep quiet! There's something down there with you, remember?!" I shout. Brandon next to me petrified, not moving a muscle.

He was silent again. I didn't want to say anything and give his location away, so I decided to wait until he spoke. A few minutes went by. All we could hear was Jake struggling to find his way through this labyrinth, with little to no sight.

"Goddamnit" he whispers.

"What's going on, man? You okay?"

"Yeah, I'm.. I'm fine. My phone is just at ten percent, so I don't know how much longer I can use my light!"

I could hear the fear in his voice.

"It's okay, Jake. Just look for that door. Have you found it yet?"

"Not yet. I think I'm getting clos.. Oh my..no! This can't be real! What the fuck is this place!" Jake shouts.

"What is it, Jake!? What do you see?"

He began to cry. It was a minute or so, before he was able to speak. Holding back tears, he said "There's like twenty dead bodies down here! They're all in matching robes. It looks like they've been dead for awhile!"

I let him cry a bit, before speaking.

"Okay, Jake. I know this is going to sound impossible but you just have to stay calm, okay? Just keep quiet and focus on finding your way out of there. Have you found the door yet?"

He takes a few deep breaths, calming himself down. In a soft, defeated tone he finally said "Yeah.. I see a door, but I don't even know if that's the one I came in though."

"You had to kick it down, didn't you? I think you'd be able to tell if it was the right door, or not." I say half kidding, hoping a little humor might help.

All I heard was sniffling, and the sound of Jake wiping the tears from his face with his sleeve.

"These fucking symbols, man! I just want to go home!" he yelled, his voice trembling.

"The symbols are down there, too?"

"They're fucking everywhere! On the floor! On the walls! And even the freaking ceiling! I'm pretty sure that door had one on it, too!"

"The door! Did you find the door you kicked open?" I asked.

He began to cry, struggling to get out "I hear it again. It's back! I don't know where to hide and that thing is back!"

I went to say something, but he shushed me. And as soon as he did, I shut the hell up. The next word out of my word could get my friend killed.

I gave the phone to Brandon and put my head back down into the hole, hoping to hear whatever Jake was talking about. But it was silent. It was way too quiet for all of this to be going on.
