Can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on? I'm convinced I'm either losing my mind in some sort of unlocking of latent schizophrenia, or I took a drug of some kind and can't remember doing so. This has to be impossible, it *has to be*. 

I'm not sure where to even start. I'm a small scale farmer. I mostly raise cattle on a small scale. I have a neighbor named Tim. He's a great guy, and a good friend. He comes by every once in a while to hang with me, or to help me with farm tasks. I help him out sometimes too on his nearby farm. 

It all started last night. I have a cow, and she was pregnant. Had a vet come out and evaluate her and what not, and she was soon due. Last night she gave birth. It was about 11:00 at night. I started noticing the typical signs, and I grab my tools and the long arm-length bags you cover up with to reach inside the cow and what-not. It went fine for the most part, pretty standard procedure. Odd thing happened though. The calf has covered in this thick web of flesh all over it when it came out. We call it being wrapped "in the caul". It's not super rare, but it isn't really commonplace either. But it is a little unusual, kind of like when you get two yokes in one egg. 

So I'm doing my standard thing. I've helped cows give birth a thousand times, and I'm alone in the barn. Birth went well, I go down to snip away the caul off of the calf. The caul is covering it all up so it has this hazy look about it, and its really dark on in the inside with this thick liquid. When I snip it with my shears, all of this blood comes pouring out, and the calf is all bloody and writhing about. I go to get a hose nearby to help rinse it off. It's covered in straw and it reeks of this sewage kind of smell. It's awful. I go to rinse the calf off and it's lurching in this kind of heaving sort of way. Calves tend to get fussy when they're first born, 'cause they try to get up as soon as possible to walk. It's head is facing away from me. Something was off. 

I start feeling that feeling like really hard. Like I'm walking towards the calf, but this feeling like something was wrong was just nagging me. The calf turns around and clear as fucking day, I swear to Jesus, it has a human face. *A human fucking face.* I wouldn't be telling you about it if I hadn't actually seen it. A human face. Looked just like a middle aged guy who had jumped into a mud puddle, and then rolled around in straw. I drop my hose and gasp. 

It's eyes were all yellow. It did this weird staggering kind of walk before it collapsed onto a pile of hay. I'm sitting there, mouth agape at what I'm seeing. I'm still not convinced I didn't hallucinate it all to be honest. I was sitting there and I could not believe what I was looking at, and I was frozen to the spot with fear. It stares off into space, heaving its weird heaves. I'm shaking really hard right now, because I'm not processing what I'm seeing. *Then it looks at me.* 

Before I can even put a thought together, it starts talking. 

"You need to leave this place. There is a woman living in the woods nearby and she is going to eat your friend. You need to leave."

It had this deep voice. Like I'm not even sure how describe it. I can't even tell you how creepy it is. I can't put it in words. 

I do the only thing a middle-aged American man living in the Southern Appalachians does when he is confronted with the horrifying unknowable mysteries of the universe. I ran out of there screaming like hell and go grab my shotgun. This alerts the attention of my neighbor Tim. I'm screaming and yelling and cussing. I'm loading up my shotgun. My legs are shaking, and I'm breathing real heavy-like. I'm muttering to myself and I come storming out of my house with my loaded double barrel, when he comes out on his porch looking out at me. I'm walking briskly to the barn where this "human-calf thing" is. Tim shouts over to me about what the hell is going on. I don't answer him, I walk straight into that barn and aim my shot gun at that calf's face. 

It gets up like it's nothing, and books it out of the back of my barn. I fire a shot or two after it, screaming and yelling at it. My neighbor Tim comes rushing up to me and demands to know what the hell is going on. He's got his own shotgun, and I look over to him and point to the silhouette rushing out across the field into the woods surrounding the pasture I have enclosed near my house. I'm a blubbering mess, and I shoot a couple more rounds at the thing before it disappears into the woods. I miss of course, and Tim is looking at me with his very worried look on his face. I burst into tears. 

It took Tim 30 minutes to calm me down enough to be able to get two coherent words out of my mouth. I try to tell him what I saw. He's looking at me like I'm crazy. I swear to God, I swear to Buddha, I'll even swear to the great Spaghetti Monster in the sky. It was a calf with a human face and it talked to me. I try telling him what it said. I start crying again because it's ludicrous. He's trying to calm me down. He says he believes me. Says he saw it running across the field too. But he starts telling me that maybe it was a coyote or a deer or something. And I'm sitting there telling him I pulled that abomination out a cow's hoo-ha so I think I know what I saw. Tim says its late. I've been up for too long, and he only saw a wet four legged creature running across the field. I ask him if he saw it's face. He says he never got a good look at it because it ran off so quickly. I wish I had had my phone on me. But you don't expect shit like that to happen to you. I ask him to check the barn and see where it was. We head back to the barn, and the cow that gave birth is quietly laying down dozing off. There's blood and the caul on the hay nearby, but the calf is gone. Tim is clearly a little weirded out, but he says there has to be a rational explanation for it. Again, a coyote. Probably snuck in while the cow was giving birth and snatched the calf after it was born. Or maybe the calf was deformed and I scared it off or something. He says he's not sure he has an explanation but he's sure that we will be safe.

I told him about the warning. Tim scoffs and says he's damn sure no one is gonna get to him. He's got a gun. He offers to stay the night with me because I'm so freaked out. We pull some blankets out and sleep on the couches in my living room. I have my shotgun next to me, and Tim has his. He says he'll shoot first and ask questions later if anyone or anything tries coming near the property. I don't know how, but he falls asleep pretty much instantly. I have my couch side lamp still on. I keep looking out of the window. I can't see much 'cause the light is blocking the view, but I see the dark woods and the pasture. The trees are swaying in the wind, and it starts to rain. I hear the pitter-patter of the rain on my roof. It's coming down hard. The lamp near me starts flickering, and the wind is howling real hard on the side of my house. I keep my eyes outside on the woods and the pasture. Every movement of the trees makes me jump. Reminds me of the calf running off away from me. Lamp's still flickering, and I start getting sleepy. Tim was right, I had a long day. 14 hours. I start nodding off. The light suddenly goes out. I jump suddenly out of my drowsiness. I can see the field and the trees pretty good now. I'm staring out, and I can hear the rain. The wind is moving stuff in my yard. I start trying to calm down. Maybe Tim was right. Maybe the calf was just horribly deformed and I imagined it spoke to me. I drove away the poor thing into the woods away from its mother because I over-reacted. 

I'll go searching for the poor thing in the morning after the storm. Hopefully it will survive the night. It couldn't have gone far. I'm too tired to go out and the weather is terrible. The bangs on the side of the house from branches and debris and the howling of the wind are kind of unsettling. But my eyes are drooping. The pitter-patter of the rain has always been so relaxing to me. I'm not sure how, but I manage to actually fall asleep. 

I wake up from a dreamless sleep in a panic. Shotgun next to me. I look around. Tim isn't in the living room. His shot gun is gone, and the blankets have been cast aside. I hear a pan jostling in my kitchen and I breathe a sigh of relief. Tim's in the kitchen cooking something up. It smells good. Some kind of sausage meat. I get up lazily, rubbing my eyes. I get into the kitchen and there's no one there. Meat is sizzling on the stove, and the back door is open. I walk over, look out my back porch and call out for Tim. He's nowhere to be found. Just the wind gently brushing past the wind chimes on my porch. It's dead silent when I hear a toilet flush. I walk back inside and there's Tim, coming out of my bathroom. I breathe a sigh relief. I tell him I thought he had left. 

He says he's been up for the last 30 minutes. A noise had woke him up. He asks what I'm cooking. I ask him what he's talking about, I thought he started the food. He pushes past me and looks into the kitchen. The meat is starting to burn at this point. He turns off the stove and rushes to the living to grab his shot gun. The smell of the meat isn't so good anymore. It's got this smoky, acrid, metallic flavor to it. I cough a bit as the smoke comes off the pan. I walk into the living room, and head to my couch with my shot gun. Tim has this wild look on his face. 

"I did not start cooking. Someone was in this house with us."

I grip my shotgun. He suggests we call a sheriff and stay put. I pull out my phone, but the service in our area sucks. I can't get a call through to 911. The power is still out from the storm last night. He's trying his phone. Nothing on his end either. I suggest we head into town. Tim says he wants to stay put. Doesn't want this person breaking into the house again. I think about leaving, but I don't want to leave Tim alone, and Tim insists he wants to stay put. Police will just take a break-in report anyways. I want to leave but I decide to stay put. Tim is so stubborn sometimes. 

We suddenly hear a knock at the window. We both turn and this old ancient looking lady at the window. She's old and all wrinkly, and her white hair is in this mangled up mess. She's got leaves all up in the tangles. And she's disgusting. She's covered in dirt and is all wet. Her skin has dirt caked into it and mud is all over her tattered clothes. She's got this gummy smile, and just one or two brown-black teeth rotting, clinging to for dear life to her mucus covered gums. And her hand is all bony. Long yellowed gnarled fingernails. And her middle finger is *twice* as long as it should be. Tim yells at the top his lungs for his bitch to get out of here. He rushes to the back door and I follow him. He raises his shotgun up, and this old lady just starts laughing. Cackling like one of those old witches in the black in white films. He tells her she better leave now or he'll shoot her without a second thought. The old lady keeps laughing and suddenly she lunges at Tim. Tim shoots off his gun but it doesn't seem to hit her. The old lady is screaming and Tim is struggling to get her off of him. I raise my shotgun and start to aim, but they're fighting to hard I can't seem to find my target. He manages to throw her off of him. The lady lands in a puddle nearby and hisses. Tim gets up and grabs his gun again, and the lady takes off like a track star. What the hell is with things running so fast lately? I shot my gun after her, but miss. 

I swear it should have hit her. But she's running like nothing happened. Tim is furious and yelling about how she's a bitch and how he's gonna get the sheriff to throw her in jail. He starts booking it after her, and this lady is running over my pasture again. I run after Tim and yell at him that it isn't worth it. Tim doesn't hear me, he just keeps running. Lady hops the fence to the pasture and runs into the woods. Tim is close behind, and I come not far behind. I can hear the sopping wet sound of leaves under my feet. I'm losing sight of the lady and Tim. Tim is cursing up a storm, and I hear a gun shot fire out again. Tim was always a faster runner than me and I can't keep up. I jog behind, listening to the cackling of the old woman and Tim panting and angrily cursing. I'm running and then suddenly I hear Tim scream. I run like hell towards the noise but he seems to be off in another direction. I hear a shot gun blast. Then another. And another. Tim is still screaming, and I'm frantically trying to the follow the noise and find him. Then everything goes eerily silent. I stop running, and I'm panting. I start walking, trying to catch my breath. I call out for him. 

"Tim!"

I start running again, looking around. 

"Tim!"

I'm lost. My friend is in danger and I'm lost in the woods. Damn it. My pants are soaked and covered in old leaves and dirt. I'm panting and trying to figure out where to go. I run forward. It feels like hours. I'm going nowhere it feels like. I yell out for Tim until my voice is hoarse. I must have ran like that for over an hour. I was totally exhausted. I never go out into these woods. I keep walking. My legs hurt. My shoes are soaking wet and I can feel my feet squishing in my socks.

 I suddenly notice a clearing. 

I walk up to it and I see this old log cabin. It's tiny and in a terrible state. Moss is growing all over it. And there's this horrible smell. Like raw sewage. The roof is practically caving in. I walk up to it and the door is open. If you could call it a door. It was a rotten wet piece of wood barley hanging onto two rusted iron hinges. The smell of sewage grows stronger. I stop for a second and think twice about walking into the cabin. Then I hear whimpering.

"You evil bitch. I'll kill you, you evil bitch."

Then I hear gurgling.

It's Tim's voice. It coming from the cabin. I swallow my trepidation. I slowly walk towards the cabin. As I do, the smell gets stronger. I lift my shotgun up. The darkness of the interior of the cabin gets closer. I inch my way slowly to the door. Then through it. And then I am greeted with the most horrible sight my eyes have ever had the displeasure of seeing. 

The cabin is filled to the brim with human body parts. Arms. Legs. Torsos. In the corner there are guts, all tied together like offal from a cow. Blood is on everything. I wretch and try not to throw up. Tears well in my eyes. The smell of sewage is everywhere. Flies are everywhere. There's no heads. Just body part after body part. Hunks of unidentified meat sit on rotting wooden counters. A pile of refuse, blood, and corpses and bones. Flies are landing on my face but I don't notice. And in the middle of it all, there is Tim. The whimpering is gone. His face is cold and lifeless. Blood trickling down his face from his mouth. His torso gashed open. Gaping. A bloody maw. He lies there lifeless on a pile of discarded human body parts. Like some kind of slaughtered animal. I back up out of the cabin. Shotgun at the ready. Shaking like the leaves in the trees blown by the breeze outside. Stomach churning. Tears silently rolling down my face. I turn to run. But before I do, I notice an object on the floor next to the door. It's gelatinous. The surface of it is wet and shiny, reflecting the light of the clouds outside. It's Tim's liver.

I book it out of there. I run in the opposite direction. I keep running and don't stop no matter how much my legs ache. No matter how much my lungs scream for air. I've got to go get help. I live 40 mins from the nearest town. I've got to get Tim help. I've got to run. I run and run and suddenly see the fence to my pasture. Oh Thank God. I sprint until I get to my house. I'm gasping, gulping for air. I grab my keys. I leave my house without taking anything with me. Without even grabbing my coat.

I'm taking that damn calf's advice.
