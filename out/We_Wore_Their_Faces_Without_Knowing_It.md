My husband and I moved into the farmhouse just three short weeks after our marriage. It was an old building. White with chipped paint, creaky floors, everything was “original” on the inside. But the charm of the place was where it was located. Out in the country. Quiet, rustic and elegant in its own way. 

Everything was perfect in the beginning. Waking up to the sounds of birds chirping, coffee on the front porch, watching the deer run through the fields, and at night the fireflies would twinkle and glimmer in a magical and surreal way. 

I told my husband over and over again that we were living in the middle of a romance novel. He would just laugh and roll his eyes a little bit. 

“Quit watching Hallmark channel babe. It’s a nice place. But it’s just our home.”

That was my husband. No nonsense. Straightforward and steady in everything that he did. He was consistent, he was a constant, and he was my rock. 

Life was simple for a while. No expectations or worries. But it all slowly started to change. Weird things happened without explanation. 

The first time was about 3 months in. 

I was getting ready for bed, brushing my teeth, when I heard a ticking sound from behind the mirror of our medicine cabinet. It was fast and almost animal like. I opened it up thinking maybe it was a rodent or something like that. But everything was normal. Pill bottles were where they should be. Nothing out of place. 

It happened a couple of times that week, and when I told my husband he just laughed it off. 

“Honey. I swear to God. You watch too many movies. There isn’t anything in this place. Maybe some creaky floorboards. But that’s about it.” 

It was true. I watch a lot of movies. Horror movies especially. But something didn’t feel right about it. It wasn’t natural and it didn’t have a pattern. It was like something in the house was mocking me. Playing with my head. 

It was a couple of nights later I woke up to go to the bathroom. Probably around 2 or 3am. I passed the hallway window and I noticed something. It was my husband. He was out in the middle of the field under the moonlight. Just standing silently and facing away from the house. Wasn’t on his phone, no flashlight. Just his silhouette standing out in the open. 

I was confused at first. Maybe he was sleepwalking? But then he tilted his head up towards the sky and I swear to Christ his mouth opened up like he was going to scream. But no sound. Just that awkward position. His jaw gaping open, and his head held upwards. 

I ran downstairs to try and go out to him. But when I opened the door he was gone. I went back to bed, and he was there. Lying down and breathing normal. Just sleeping. 

But me - I didn’t sleep at all for the rest of the night. When I asked him about it, he had no memory of it. Like it never happened. 

I tried not to let it bother me. That is, what I had seen. But it did bother me. There was something odd about it. Something I couldn’t quite wrap my head around. What the hell was he doing? How did he get back to bed so fast? It didn’t make sense. 

Maybe my own thoughts were deceiving me. It HAD been late at night. I had a nightcap before I went to bed. Took some meds. Perhaps I was in some sort of unconscious state. But I knew that wasn’t it. I had seen it. It was eating at me. 

The other thing was my husband. On top of not remembering what had happened, there was something off about him. Things that most people would probably dismiss as minor, but just didn’t seem right to me. 

He had always hummed when he cooked. Always the same song too - “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey. It was dumb - but it was also charming to me in a silly way. I don’t even think he liked Journey. But since that night, he had just stopped. 

He still cooked for me, still washed the dishes and would lean in for a kiss when I passed by. But it didn’t feel natural. It was almost rehearsed. Off by a few seconds. Unnatural in some way. Like he was pretending to be his own self. 

I tried to tell myself that it was the stress of things changing. New marriage, new house, new lifestyle. Things were getting to my head and that made my mind wander. 

But it got weirder. 

Every night I was waking up to the same scene. My husband standing by the bedroom window. His breath fogging up the glass. Just looking out towards the field. Like there was something there. Something waiting to come out. 

I would call him back to bed. Whisper his name. But he wouldn’t move. He just stood there. Eventually he would come back to bed and roll over into the blankets. Laying there silently. 

He had always snored too. But now he didn’t. In fact, I don’t know if he was sleeping at all. Once I woke up in the middle of the night and I could see his eyes opened wide. Staring at me and my body, studying me. Instead of saying something I would just turn over and try to sleep again. But I couldn’t. I didn’t feel like I was sleeping with my husband anymore. I was terrified. But what could I do? Call the cops? They’d think I was nuts. Call my parents? They wouldn’t believe me. 

Then one day I got an answer. I encountered part of the puzzle. 

I had been outside working in the garden when I saw the glint of metal flash from a distance. It was quick and I almost missed it, but something had reflected the sun on to my eyes. 

I walked towards the general area and just about stepped on it. 

Laying there in the grass was a watch. The leather band was torn, and the metal was bent to one side. I didn’t think much of it at first. My husband always wore a watch. Maybe he had dropped it while he was working. 

But when I picked it up my chest tightened. 

It wasn’t just any watch. It was his watch. The exact watch that I had given him as a wedding gift. His initials were engraved on the side. J.R. I could see them still scratched into the metal. 

I slipped it inside my pocket and headed towards the house. 

My husband was there. In the kitchen. Cooking dinner. He was actually humming this time. But it wasn’t “Don’t Stop Believing”. It was just some low buzzing tuneless sound. It didn’t sound much like anything. 

He stopped as soon as he saw me. 

“Hey babe. How’s the garden?”

I looked over and stared right at his wrist. 

The watch was there. Sitting perfectly snug against his wrist. The leather wasn’t torn. There were no scratches or dents. I could see the initials on the side. J.R. 

I froze in that moment. I fumbled for words and stuttered , “You st- still have your watch…don-don’t you?” 

He glanced down, almost as if he had forgotten it was there. “Of course I do, honey. Why?” 

I did my best to force a smile, and I could feel my hands trembling against my sides. I excused myself to the bathroom and locked the door behind me as I pulled the broken watch from my pocket and set it on the counter next to the sink. 

Two of them. The exact same watch, identical right down to the engraving. 

I nervously wrapped the broken watch inside of a towel and hid it in the cabinet under the sink. 

I tried to sleep that night but I couldn’t. I kept thinking about what I had seen. My husband’s broken watch, and a copy that was in pristine condition on his wrist. 

Something was wrong and I couldn’t put my finger on it. Things felt off. Things weren’t right. 

A couple of days went by and things were still strange. I didn’t feel connected to my husband. He felt foreign to me. 

Then the smell started. 

Faint at first, earthen and metallic, sort of like an old penny. I walked around the house and finally caught the scent most strongly by the hallway closet. We had only used that closet for storage since we bought the home. The smell seemed obvious to me, but my husband hadn’t said anything about it. He had been keeping about his daily routine. Walking throughout the house, tending to things here and there. 

That same night, after I heard his breathing become shallow and low while in bed, I got up and followed the smell. It led me right back to the closet. I opened the door and pushed aside some old coats and objects in the way and finally felt a small gap in the back wall. 

I pushed and a crawlspace opened up as the drywall collapsed. 

I was hit with a wave of rotten air. 

Gagging, I reached for my phone and turned on the flashlight. 

There, inside, curled up into a fetal position, was my husband. His eyes opened but cloudy, mouth frozen open in what looked like a scream. His nails were dirty and I could see traces of dried blood over his body. 

I tried to scream but I couldn’t. My throat had locked up and I could barely manage to breathe, let alone make a sound. I stood up, and stumbled backward into the doorframe. 

That’s when I heard the voice behind me. 

“Ahh. I see you’ve found him.”

I spun.

There he was. My husband, standing in the hall, alive and smiling. Only I knew it wasn’t him. The smile was stretched unnaturally wide, the skin tugged tightly at the corners of his mouth. His eyes were black and wide. 

He stepped forward with a crooked and unnatural gait. 

“It’s okay. Don’t cry. I can explain what’s happened.” His voice was strangely layered and reverberated through the hall.  It was my husband’s voice on top of something else. A deep guttural, animal-like sound. 

“Your husband was imperfect. A rough draft. Just a sketch. I am the finished product.” 

I was inching closer towards the wall as he spoke. My heart was beating out of my chest as I felt cold sweat dripping down my neck.

I looked right at him. “What the fuck are you?” 

He titled his head slightly and pursed his lips together. A wry grin etched onto his face. 

“We are the shadows that follow the ones who walk in the light. We live in the cracks and crevices that you cannot see. We wait until the time is right.” 

My mind was a web of terror and fear. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening. I only knew that I was dealing with something far stranger than I was used to. 

“I don’t understa-“

Suddenly his voice hissed and cracked liked thunder. 

“Do think that your life means something? That it belongs to you? It was never yours. It was ours. You are a placeholder. Every breath you take is a lie. Your dreams, your thoughts, your tender moments…they are borrowed.”

The air around him was cold, and his presence brought a weight and dread that I had never felt. 

His eyes were locked tightly on mine. I could sense a wet and palpable hunger in them. 

“Do you understand now?”, he whispered as he titled his head towards his shoulder and licked his lips. “You are only the marrow that exists so we can have the bones.” 

I heard the sound of steps coming down the hall. A second voice joined in. 

Not just any voice. My voice. 

“Hello.”

A second me stepped out of the bedroom. Same clothes, same hair, she even had the same tiny scar on the corner of her lip like I did. She looked right at me, her eyes manic and hungry. 

Then together, they stepped toward me. Not quickly, but steady and determined. 

I bolted towards the stairs. 

I nearly fell down as I reached the doorway at the bottom, and ripped open the front door. The grass was slicing my bare feet as I ran, but I didn’t dare stop. I didn’t look back until I was more than halfway across the hayfield. 

When I finally looked, I realized that they weren’t chasing me. 

They were standing on the porch, side by side. My husband and my double, their mouths curved upward with bliss. Their hands rose together in perfect unison. 

And they waved. 

They stepped back into the house and I saw the glow of the kitchen light turn on. Through the window I could see her, my double, setting the table with two plates. The thing that looked like my husband, taking his seat at the head of the table. 

They were there in our house, living our life. And in that moment I realized something. They weren’t wearing our faces. We had been wearing theirs.
