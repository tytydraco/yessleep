I’m exhausted, but I can’t just not tell anybody about this. And since I’m not talking with my folks, you guys will just have to do.



I’ll start from the top—when I first realized something wasn’t right. It was Saturday, around two a.m. I couldn’t sleep.



I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, pulling at the loose, dark skin that forms the bags under my eyes, and that’s when I saw another red, rust-colored scab on my lower eyelid.



Either this rash is weakening my skin to the point where it’s tearing, or I’m scratching myself bloody in my sleep.



I looked down at my left hand, the place where it all started. You’d think I’d put it between two feral cats having it out, judging by all the small red, crusty spots and lines running up from my knuckles to my shoulder.



It’s been two weeks, and the rash has only gotten worse. I’ve tried everything—chamomile lotion, aloe vera, hot water, cold water, even this weird suggestion I got from a buddy online about banana peels, though I think he was just pulling my exceedingly desperate leg.



I went to my doctor, and they said I must be having an allergic reaction to something. But what? I haven’t changed a thing. Same old laundry detergent, same old body wash, even the same old scratchy bedsheets. They set me up with an appointment with a specialist, but it’ll take a month to get in.



I tried a few other doctors, and at this point I’ve had so many doses of Benadryl forced into me that I’m surprised I haven’t overdosed.



Thankfully, I’ve got some sick days and vacation time saved up to wait this out until my dermatologist appointment. My boss nearly fainted when she saw me. Can’t exactly serve food with a smile while looking like a rashy leper. Between the itching and the medication, my head’s swimming. I’m so out of it that I keep remembering scabs that aren’t there, or I’ll go to scratch a spot only to find a massive scab I swear wasn’t there an hour ago—like they’re moving when I’m not looking.



I leaned on the bathroom sink, pulling my eyelid down to get a better look at the scab. A nasty thing—small, but gnarly-looking, brownish red, like an old water-soaked wound. There was even a hair poking out of it, which was strange, because as far as I knew, hairs don’t grow on eyelids.



It must’ve gotten stuck during the healing process. A loose eyelash, maybe. Still, it bothered me. It was bad enough looking like some kind of burn victim—now this thing was just sitting there.



Mocking me.



I know you’re not supposed to pick at scabs, but I couldn’t help myself. I slid my finger up and rubbed at the small black line—



and OW! Jesus Christ!



Okay. Not a hair. It was stiff, and whatever it was felt attached deep. When I poked it, the entire scab shifted.



This was going to hurt.



I knew I shouldn’t pick. But just staring at that black line was unbearable.



I just had to be careful. Slow and delicate. After all, a foreign object in a healing wound couldn’t be good, right?



I grabbed a pair of tweezers, some rubbing alcohol, and a bandage to deal with the inevitable blood. Slowly… slowly, I reached out with the tweezers and tried to grip the tip of the black line, but it kept slipping free—like it had a mind of its own.



Finally, on the fourth attempt, my patience wore thin. I grabbed it at the base, clamped down, and yanked.



It came free along with the scab and a small trickle of blood. I dropped the tweezers and cupped the bleeding spot under my eye, cursing myself.



I splashed alcohol on the wound, hissing at the burn, then slapped a bandage over it. When I turned back to the sink to grab the tweezers, I froze.



My scab was twitching.



I stared in horror as I realized the black line wasn’t a hair.



It was a leg.



One of many.



I stood there, watching the little legs kick as the scab—which I now realized wasn’t a scab at all but some grotesque little beetle latched to my skin—flailed, trying to right itself.



Maybe it was the medicine. My head wasn’t right. It had to be some bug I just hadn’t noticed. I flipped it over with the tweezers.



Its underside—no, what made up its back—was a rusty brownish-red shell that looked exactly like a scab. The moment it landed on its legs, it took off, scrambling uselessly against the ceramic sink. I turned on the faucet and washed it down the drain.



I stood there shaking, skin crawling. I’d mistaken some giant bed bug for a scab on my eye—and it had latched on so tightly it hadn’t even moved when I woke.



That’s what bed bugs do, right? They’re supposed to be sneaky.



Maybe that explained the rash.



The realization made my stomach turn.



I had to check my bed.



I walked from the bathroom to my cheap mattress, scratching my arm as I went. I flipped it. Nothing. I stripped the sheets, the pillowcases. No shells. No stains.



They had to be coming from somewhere.



I got down on my hands and knees and checked the wooden frame. That’s when I saw it.



Another red bug, lying on its back beside a dust bunny. I scooped it up with my slipper to get a closer look.



It was bigger than the first. Its shell was lumpy, edged in white.



That same rusty reddish-brown.



It looked exactly like a scab.



Not camouflage. Not resemblance.



Exact.



No.



No no no no no—oh God, no.



The thought finally clicked.



I looked down at my arms. Scabs lined them.



Under my arms. On my hands. My elbows.



Rusty reddish-brown.



And on one or two—



Thin black lines.



Moving.



I scratched.



I couldn’t help it.



The sensation, the sight—knowing they were all over me. I raked my nails down my arm and felt something rip free. One fell onto its back, flailing. Another vanished into some crevice.



I kept scratching. Pain burned through me, but the sight of a third barely hanging on sent me into a frenzy. Scabs and blood dropped to the floor.



Some ran when they hit the ground. Others bolted toward my feet, trying to crawl up my legs. I stomped and jerked around, half-hysterical. When one made it into my shirt, I tore the stained thing off.



I couldn’t tell where it went. Every scab felt like it was moving.



I slapped and rubbed at my skin until I stumbled back into the bathroom, desperate for the mirror.



I grabbed the alcohol, tore the cap off, and dumped it across my stomach.



The burn was immediate. Wounds bubbled. Two of the things fell free, writhing on the tile.



After that, everything blurred.



The 911 operator must’ve thought I was insane. Who would believe me?



But when the police arrived and saw me, they labeled my apartment hazardous immediately.



I don’t know what happened to my neighbors. I don’t know if they evacuated the building.



They brought me to some kind of medical facility. Chemical wash. Observation.



They grabbed my phone and charger on the way out. Thank God.



I overheard one of the staff mention Dermestus scabiformis while they were taking notes.



So I guess this isn’t their first rodeo.



It’s been two days and I guess i'm healing well.



The wounds have scabbed over again.



They keep telling me not to pick.



But… wouldn’t you?
