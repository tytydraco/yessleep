The Shadowbrook Woods is a forest somewhere in the Pacific Northwest. It has an eerie, dark atmosphere—or at least that was my first impression when I went camping there with the Boy Scouts back when I was 13. Stories of supernatural creatures, mutant animals, and other horrors still give me nightmares to this day, even though I’m now 28 and living in South Florida. I’m going to recount the tales of these woods and the terrible things that happened during the week we spent there.

Day 1: The Arrival

When we arrived, the forest felt like any other in the Pacific Northwest hills. We parked the trucks in the lot and began our hike into the foggy woods. That’s when I heard a deep growl. 

Of course I was scared shitless, but my scout leader Randy looked back to mean and said softly don’t worry bud it’s probably just a far off bobcat or something. Of course I didn’t believe what else is a socially awkward 13 year old going to believe. 

The scout leaders son, Jacob and my best friend told me “not to worry, it’s probably just some stupid dumb animal”. That definitely made me feel better about the situation. 

When we got to camp we learned how to start a fire and feed the fire to keep it “alive” as Randy told us. This was definitely the most fun I’ve ever had. “This is so much better than cub scouts I shouted” I was then met by a stern look from our scout leader. He said “these woods don’t belong to us. They aren’t ours to do whatever we want. We must respect the land. If we don’t there might be consequences. He muttered softly. 

A look of concern swept over his face as he said those words. He must have noticed that I saw his concerned look. Because all of a sudden he perked up with excitement and yelled in a strict yet playful manner “who wants to hear a story!” We all gathered around the campfire telling our own scary stories with the stereotypical flashlight under our chins but then our leader told us a story. 

The story my scout leader told us was about the Weeping Woman. It went something like this:

Back in the pioneer days, when everyone was hunting for gold, an old wagon train veered off the Oregon Trail, trying to find an alternate route west. They became lost in the Shadowbrook Woods. A woman on the train had just given birth, which added more weight to the wagon—a big issue back then. Her husband, the baby’s father, told her she had to leave the baby behind, or they’d all die.

Unwilling to abandon her child, the woman took a gun from the wagon and shot herself and the baby. But not before she shot everyone else in the wagon train, including her two older children. To this day, they say you can still hear her crying, just as she did after she massacred her family.

Some even claim if you wander too far off the path, you may become her next victim.

I know it sounds like an old urban legend, but to my 13-year-old self, it sent shivers down my spine. I sat by the campfire in silence as the others laughed it off.

When it was time to go to our tents and the lights went out, I lay there with my eyes wide open, listening to the forest around me. My tent mate, Jacob, was sound asleep, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

It must have been around 2:00 AM when I heard it—a faint cry, like a woman and a baby sobbing. I also heard creaking wood and the sound of oxen, as if a wagon train was nearby. My body tensed as I peered out of the tent. And there she was, standing there, gazing into the campground, a baby in one arm and a gun in the other. I snapped a photo—I’ll have to look for it back at my parents’ place in California. I’ll post it when I find it during my visit at the end of the month.

I pulled myself back into my sleeping bag, clenched my eyes shut, and tried to sleep or at least convince myself it was all a nightmare. This can’t be happening I told myself. Why all of a sudden are these woods such a nightmare?

Eventually, I dozed off, waking up to birds chirping, a crackling fire, and the smell of bacon and eggs. I heard the familiar sound of my scout mates laughing and talking around the fire. Still stiff with fear, I lay in my sleeping bag until I could muster the courage to join them.

Day 2: It Continues

As I sat there with my bacon and eggs, the other scouts acted like nothing had happened the night before. But I knew exactly what I had seen, and to this day, I still see that damn woman in my dreams. I always wake up in a cold sweat at the same time, night after night. 2 AM on the dot.

My friends must have noticed my fear because as I was sitting there still in a paralysis state my best friend Jacob came up behind and yelled Boo! I must have jumped 10 feet in the air. No visibly angry looking to the ground where my half eaten strip of bacon landed. Jacob said “what did a little old story scare you” 

The other scouts laughed. But they didn’t see what I saw and they definitely don’t have to deal with what I went through. Little did Jacob know he’d soon be the next victim of one of his dad’s little “tall tales” as Jacob put it.

Throughout the day, we went about our activities, working on earning badges. But as we moved around camp, I overheard the leaders talking about something being “inevitable.” My 13-year-old self didn’t know what they meant, but looking back now, at 28, I think I finally understand. 

We did some exploring around the surrounding woods and did our day of merit badge assignments and overall The day passed without incident, and as night fell, we gathered around the campfire again. This time, the scout leader told us another story, this one called The Trapper.

It went something like this:

Back in 1921, there was an old trapper everyone called Thumper. No one knew exactly how he got the nickname, but he was known for trapping badgers, foxes, and beavers in these woods. One day, he fell into one of his own traps in a creek nearby and drowned, while his loyal dog, starving and desperate, ended up eating his remains. They say Thumper still roams the woods as a waterlogged, hollow-eyed ghost. If you hear his fiddle playing, they say he’s out hunting again, and any living creature he finds will join him, trapped forever in the Shadowbrook Woods.

Another chill ran down my spine. Something felt off about the whole environment. The woods were quieter than they’d ever been, as if even the creatures sensed something sinister. No owls hooted, no cicadas buzzed. The silence was unsettling.

I went to my sleeping bag early, hoping to fall asleep while the campfire was still lit. Somehow, I managed to drift off. But at around 4 AM, a sound woke me—the faint strains of a fiddle. My tent mate Jacob was sitting straight up, wide awake.

“You heard that too?” I asked quietly. He only motioned for me to stay silent.

What we heard next still makes me sick to think about. The tent next to us rustled, and we heard the zipper pull slowly. Our friend Kellen stepped out and walked into the woods, following the sound of the fiddle. I’ll cut to the chase—Kellen was never seen or heard from again. That is, until about six months ago, when a hunter stumbled upon his bones scattered along a creek bed they now call Deadman’s Creek.

Day 3: Mourning Kellen’s Death

We all woke up to our leader looking at the campfire with a blank stare. That of dread, that of fear, and almost like he knew something was going to happen. 

Not much happened on this day. No scary stories around the campfire. Just small talk about Kellen, memories of since we we were only 6 when we all met. 

You would think the scout leaders would have taken us home but for some reason they kept us out there I’m not sure why even to this day.

One of the other scouts, his name was Xander who totally had the hots for Kellen and I think Kellen did too. But I won’t judge them at all. But anyways he was crying like a baby and Randy did call his dad to come pick him up. Our assistant scout leader Rick walked him to the parking lot where his dad Matt picked him up. About 2 hours later Matt got back to camp. I’m not sure if maybe he talked to Xanders dad for a while or what but it was only a 30 minute hike to the parking lot where we parked the trucks and trailer. 

Again I’m not sure but I think something fishy is definitely going on here. But it’s whatever I guess. As thoughts filled my head of memories of Kellen as I looked down to my freeze dried Beef stroganoff I started to wonder what was really going on here. Maybe it’s something to do with the woods. Supernatural maybe? Or maybe the government? I’m not sure. 

After dinner we all headed to our tents with our heads hung low some of us still sobbing and even crying, we all fell asleep to the soothing sound of crickets around us. 

Day 4: is the government involved?

On the morning of day 4 we all woke up around the same time and gathered around the campfire where we roasted breakfast sausage over the open flames. 

Our leader acted as if nothing happened and we all became skeptical of him after that. Is he involved somehow? Is this some sort of child death cult. What the fuck. 

The day went on and we continued to earn badges. Then the night campfire came. No stories, however I did overhear the scout leader talkinguu about “the facility” was it a government facility was it a cult facility what the hell was he talking about. Either way I wasn’t gonna be caught in these creepy ass woods overnight. 

Day 5: the story continues 

We woke up at the normal 6 AM to the familiar smell of bacon and eggs. Our scout leader was sitting next to the fire reading something that looked like a pamphlet from a truck stop ggyou know one of those ones that tells yiu what to do in that area. 

We played games today it was our free day me and Jacob decided to go exploring the woods. Something didn’t seem right about them at all. So we got our compass and map and headed down the trail.

We came across deadman’s creek and then there was no sign of Kellen, however there were footprints that lead right into the creek. Something definitely felt off about the whole thing. But I wasn’t sure what it was. 

Was our scout leader trying to warn us with these stories, im not sure. Jacob and I then came across a Large chain link fence that had no trespassing signs about every 50 feet or so. What was this place I asked him. “Dude I don’t fucking know” should we go in i replied. He muttered out only 2 words. Fuck no. 

We made our way back to camp since the sun was starting to set. Just as we were about to get back to camp we saw a blue jeep with some decal on the side and our scout leader talking to 2 men 1 was in a lab coat the other in military gear. What the fuck is happening here dude Jacob whispered. 

We heard them talking about another story to tell us. Shit they must have seen us somehow. But this was definitely not your ordinary scout camp. I know there is cash compensation for scout leaders that touch you inappropriately but what about fucking kidnapping children. What do I get if that happens!

A few moments later we heard the jeep start up and drive off.. we wondered into camp as if we’ve seen nothing. Our scout leader sat us all by the fire and told us the next story. This one was called Alfie the bear. It went something like this.

Back in 1962 in a nuclear research facility the United States government was doing tests on various animals to see what the affects of nuclear radiation would do to them. One subject Alfie the bear was exposed to extremely high amounts of nuclear radiation. He eventually started to grow a second head and a second pair of paws. After a couple weeks of being in a coma he woke up killed everyone in the facility and escaped into these very woods. 

He then explained there was a fenced off area somewhere in the woods where Alfie’s den was and told us never EVER to go anywhere near the fence. Alfie had an extremely enhanced sense of smell and would know if anyone came even remotely close to the fence. 

I looked at Jacob with a look of fear and horror. But then it hit me. These stories are keeping us away from something. Why the hell would he tell a story about the fence right after we just saw it. What the fuck are they hiding from us. Whatever the fuck it was was extremely suspicious. 

We all went to bed at the same time that night. I for the first time slept entirely through the night.

Day 6: the lab coat guys

When we woke up on the sixth day we heard voices outside. Someone I didn’t recognize. I looked out of the mesh window of the tent to see the lab coat guys 2 of them. Talking to our scout leader. 

Our scout leader yelled for all of us to come outside. These men have a very important message for you, he said. 

The man in the lab coat introduced himself as a scientist from Shadowbrook corp. he said he oversees a lab somewhere in the forest. I knew this had something to do with me and Jacob. 

The man explained how dangerous the woods are if we don’t stay in our camp and to whoever saw the fence must forget about it or else there will be consequences. We didn’t say that we saw it but deep down I knew that he knew. These woods are dangerous he said with a concerned look on his face.

We all had questions but we knew they wouldn’t be answered. The man ended his statement by telling the story of Draco29982 an asteroid that had hit somewhere in the forest that they had been researching. 

Is this just another story to scare us or was this real. Could this have been causing all the strange things happening. Could this be what they are taking children for? I’m not sure I’m just glad that we get to go home tomorrow. 

Day 7: home

We left the camp at around 7:30 AM and boy was I relieved. Everything I’ve seen in that forest still haunts me today. The weeping woman, Alfie the bear. And especially thumper the trapper. Our scout leader is definitely behind something sinister. I’m not sure what or why but he is still a leader today. And about every 3 years a scout mysteriously passes away in the Shadowbrook woods. 

I’m finally home collecting my thoughts. I told my mom that I don’t want to be in Boy Scouts anymore she obviously objected and told me that I need to stay in. I told her that I want to switch troops if I have to stay in. Don’t get me wrong I love scouts. But I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to go through that again. 

I’m on my way to my parents house in California now and I’m honestly thinking about visiting the Shadowbrook Woods. I’ll be close to the Pacific Northwest anyway so I might as well. I’ll submit another Reddit post if I decide to go that way. But honestly I don’t know if I can go through that horror again.
