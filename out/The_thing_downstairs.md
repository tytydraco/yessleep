Hello there dear Reddit users! I have wanted to share this story for a long time and now I finally got the courage to share it with you people, thank you for your time.

I woke up to a sound coming from downstairs. It was the middle of the night, and I knew I was alone in the house. My heart started racing as I tried to shake off the grogginess and listen more closely. I could hear footsteps moving around, but I couldn't tell if it was a person or something else.

I reached for my phone, but it wasn't there. I must have left it in the living room before going to bed. I had to go down and investigate, but I didn't want to make a sound. I crept out of bed and tiptoed to the door, hoping to avoid being heard.

As I made my way down the stairs, the footsteps grew louder. They sounded like they were coming from the living room. I approached the door, my heart pounding in my chest. I peeked through the crack in the door and saw a figure standing in front of the TV, facing away from me.

I couldn't see who or what it was, but the feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach told me it wasn't human. The figure suddenly turned around, and I saw its face for the first time. It was a grotesque monster with razor-sharp teeth and piercing yellow eyes. Its skin was a sickly shade of green, and it seemed to be staring right at me, even though I was hidden in the shadows.

I tried to back away quietly, but my foot hit a loose floorboard, and the monster turned towards me. I froze in terror as it started to move closer. Its movements were jerky and unnatural, like it wasn't used to moving in the human world. I knew I had to get out of there, but I couldn't move.

Suddenly, the monster let out a bloodcurdling scream, and I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I realized too late that it had claws, and it had just sliced through my flesh. I stumbled backwards, trying to escape, but it was too late. The monster was upon me, and I could feel its hot breath on my face.

I closed my eyes, waiting for the final blow, but it never came. When I opened them again, I was back in my bed, covered in sweat. It had all been a nightmare. But as I looked around the room, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was still there, watching me.

The next morning, I went down to the living room to check if everything was okay. Everything looked normal, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was different. That's when I saw the scratch marks on the floorboards, evidence that something had been there last night. The memory of that monster still haunted me, and I knew I would never feel safe in my own home again.
