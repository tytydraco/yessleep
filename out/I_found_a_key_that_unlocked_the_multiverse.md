So I think I should start by telling you all that I’m just a normal guy in a dead end job and no real friends or family to brag about but my whole life changed a year ago and this is what happened.

It was a normal Friday evening and I was on my way home from work when I came across some roadworks that meant I had to follow a diversion round, it was pretty dark and as I was following the road I got a flat tire which is exactly what I wanted after a stressful week at work. I got out the car and started changing my tyre when I caught a glint of something shiny in the light from my iPhone, I went and looked and saw a single key so me being me I picked it up and put it in my pocket.

The rest of that evening was uneventful as I changed the tyre and made my way home. The next morning I got up just before midday and made my coffee and sat on my table, then I remembered the key and grabbed it to have a better look and see if I could find anything that would help me locate the owner. When I took a better look I could see it was a very old looking key with no real identifying marks so set it on the table whilst finishing my coffee. Later that afternoon I grabbed the key and purely out of boredom had put it in the lock of my basement door and turned it, to my surprise I heard the locking mechanism engage so went to open the door to see if it really had unlocked the door.

As I opened the door I stood there in utter shock and amazement, on the other side of the door was a vast city landscape not unlike the city I lived in yet with subtle differences here and there. I wish I could tell you I shut the door and didn’t think of it anymore but come on what person in there right mind wouldn’t want to see what in the world was going on. So I let my curiosity win and I stepped through the door grabbing the key as I closed the door behind me.

This city was beautiful and huge and so familiar so I stopped someone and asked them where I am which got me a weird look and a brush off which only afterwards I realised was because a sane person would ask where they were, so I decided to find a ship or newspaper stand to grab a paper and find out where I was from there. I found a newspaper stand and grabbed a local paper and was shocked to see I was in my own city yet it couldn’t be as there was stuff that didn’t make sense like shops that I had never heard of or buildings that I had never noticed before.

Before I would start panicking I thought to myself if this was my city then I could make my way home as I have done thousands of times from the city. I have to say that it took me longer than I would have liked to find my way home but when you see roads that don’t exist or signs that make no sense whatsoever you have to go on instinct. That aside when I finally got to my house I realised that I did t have my door keys on me as in my stupidity because I went through the basement door my brain decided they were not needed. Now luckily for me I get on really well with my neighbour and we actually have a spare set of each other’s keys in case of emergencies.

I knocked on my neighbours door and a stranger answered so I told them who I was and if I could speak to the owner of the house as I had locked myself outside. This person looked me up and down and said if I don’t leave they will call the police, I tried to explain to them the situation again but they shouted something that made no sense “I’ve lived here for 30 years alone and the owner of the house next door is an old man who looks nothing like you so go or the police will be called”

I decided I was either going crazy or something wasn’t right about where I was, I then remembered the key and thought why don’t I just go back to that door in the city and go through that back to my home. So I made my way back to the city and what felt like forever I finally found the door I came through. I put the key in the lock and before I turned it I noticed something that knocked me clear off my feet in shock. I caught a glimpse of a TV in a shop window of the president given a speech but this wasn’t the president I knew, this wasn’t even a politician I recognised. This made no sense but I wanted to go home so I turned the key and ran through the door and slammed it shut.

I took a deep breath then looked into the room properly when I dropped to my knees in disbelief, this wasn’t my house I was now in some store with people staring at me as I brushed away a tear from my face. A nice woman came up to me and asked if I was ok to which I said I was fine just felt a bit under the weather. I got up and asked her if I could use the bathroom to which she happily agreed. Whilst in the bathroom I used the key on the door again and looked through and to my utter amazement I saw a vast landscape where the rest of the store should have been, I closed the door and took the key out to get a proper look at it but just as before it looked like a normal old key.

I put it back in the lock and opened the door again to help get my head around what I saw but noticed this time there was a living room on the other side. I closed the door again and reopened it and to my amazement a completely different landscape once again. It then hit me that each time the door opened it was to somewhere new. So I opened it one more time and walked through not knowing that this time I wasn’t alone and I was being tracked by someone who would change my life forever.
