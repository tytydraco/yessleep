I don’t know what to do. I feel I’ve woken to a moment of lucidity. But with what I’ve just found, I don’t know if I can even trust my own perception. I came home from work and waste no time getting on my computer, same as every day before this one. I noticed right away there was a folder on my desktop. I don’t remember making this folder. My desktop only ever has three shortcuts, I would absolutely remember at least seeing it previously if not remember making it. And I sure as shit should remember making the eleven notes inside of it. I found this folder named “Journal” almost an hour ago and my head is still spinning in panic. Please know I’m writing this as a cry for help, I don’t know how long I’ll stay in a state of clarity. I need to publicly document this in case my mind goes back under and I won’t be able to reach help.

I’m a 23 year old male living in Dexter, Michigan. For the majority that don’t know, Dexter isn’t much more than a lot of fields and cows. It’s by no means the middle of no where. But “town” is a good 10 minute drive with maybe four neighbors along the way. I say “town” loosely because it’s really just an A&W, a Kroger, and the gas station where I work. So my house is fairly secluded, my closest neighbor is miles down the road. That’s why I like it. I live out here alone, and I work the graveyard shift because I don’t like interacting with people. These things I know about myself, I’m fucking sure of it.

I would think these absurd notes are some kind of strange, poorly thought out scam. Like a fishing attempt from a sketchy torrent I downloaded? Even that would make more sense than I wrote any of these. But there’s the small details in them and the familiarity with the way they’re written that give me little to no doubt It had to of been me.

I will paste the notes below. I’ll also be adding notes \*\*like this\*\* to explain my thoughts with them. Please anyone that can recognize a pattern and could explain what kind psychosis I’m experiencing. Or if someone can go hunt whatever's in those woods.

I think I need to finally work on myself. People say keeping a journal is good for the mind, so here I am. I don’t really know what to write but I’m going to try to finally be consistent. I had mac and cheese for lunch and my mood today has been good.

\*\*Yeah, sounds like some wish-washy dribble I’d write in a self help mood.\*\*

I really wish I knew what to do with these journal entries. I guess admit I’m kind of sad. Work is fine, but how long am I really going to work there? I feel like such a loser still living at my parents. I have to do more with my life, for me. That’s what I should do with this journal, I’ll figure out and set goals for myself.

\*\*And here is where I panic. Spoiler alert, according to these notes I live with my mom, my dad and my brother? I feel horrified, I’m certain I’ve always been here alone. Any vague memory I can pull from my time here is just me. I eat here, I sleep here, I shit here, alone. Throw in going to work and playing video games, those are the only things I can remember. Me and my family are from Ann Arbor and I moved out here for the solitude. I think? It’s feeling difficult for me to remember much of anything. Obviously in an anxiety filled confusion I left my room and looked around. This house is very much lived in. A master bedroom that would clearly be my parent’s, and a bedroom similar to mine that would be my brothers. But no one is here, there’s just a screaming silence and dark rooms. The rooms don’t look left in any sort of telling state. Everything is just kind of there. What is wrong with me. I really think if you asked me how many rooms are in my house moments before I found these notes I’d say I haven’t really thought about it.\*\*

I had a lot to think about at work last night. I spent most of it really thinking about myself and figuring out what I want. And I couldn’t think of anything that stuck. I eventually just realized maybe I’m not meant to be much more than this. Maybe this is my spot.

\*\*Boohoo, you jack ass.\*\*

5/08/2024

I feel really good today! Despite feeling pretty down about myself most days, I still sometimes wake up just feeling good. The sun feels extra nice, I experience the food I eat instead of just routinely chewing it, I have this excited energy to me. I wouldn’t consider myself spiritual, but when I was getting home I heard a man singing from the woods. He sang in such a deep voice and the way it reverberated through the trees was entrancing. It was so serene, I wonder if he gave me good omens to rest on! I hope other people have days like this.

\*\*Despite how positive I am here, this entry strikes me as strange. Having a good day makes sense to me. But like I mentioned, my closest neighbor is miles from here, I’ve never even physically seen them before. The woods I’m referring to is simply the woods behind my house. I’ve never gone into them and if I had to guess, the other side of those woods is an empty field followed by either a single house or more woods. But the fact my reaction is anything other than “who the fuck is that in my backyard” is nothing but puzzling to me. Let alone what someone would be doing over here. Anyone Stumbling this way, even by accident, just doesn’t seem likely.\*\*

I hope Erik isn’t mad at me or something. We always play games together. He hasn’t even logged in today. I went to his room to see if he wanted to play, and he was just staring out the window. I asked if he wanted to hop on Dota, he just gave me a dismissive

“No, not right now.”

Maybe he’s going through the same down mood as me. Wanting more for himself, but not sure what to do or how to feel. It’s just not as fun playing without him.

\*\*It’s so difficult to communicate rationally with everything shooting through my mind right now. I love my brother. From my memory, we were close growing up. I just haven’t talked to him much, if at all, since I moved. Coming to the realization that I might have done something to push him away, or that something has happened to him is causing my heart to swallow itself. For those wondering, yes I’ve tried calling my family, all my calls immediately go to their voicemail. \*\*

I don’t know what’s going on lately. Mom has been in an almost manically positive mood. She’s never been the gardening type. But the past few days shes been hyper focused on planting a variety of flowers outside. As well as baking different pies and cookies a couple times a day. I’ve only seen her bake around our birthdays, if even then? She’s also just very bubbly. Almost anytime out paths cross she’ll offer

“Hey! How about after I wrap this up we go grab some floats huh?”

It is very sweet, and I would think I’m just being a Grinch if my dad wasn’t also expressing concern. Earlier he came up to me to confirm his thoughts weren’t irrational. Erik still doesn’t want to play any games with me. He seems completely detached and I can’t figure out why. When I ask if he would play something with me he just keeps staring outside, sometimes mumbling about how he's

"going to have to go out there.”

I don’t understand why he would want to go milling around the woods. Must be a full moon soon, I don't know. It’d be nice for things to go back to a bit more normal.

\*\*In painful hindsight, these behavior shifts should have raised more than a little concern. They’re such different changes though, maybe it was difficult to see them as related issues. Or is this entry just a reflection of my own delusions? What would make both my brother and mother act this way? The simplest answer seems like a gas leak or this old house having lead paint? Wouldn’t their hysterics be similar if that was the case? And if I’m of sound mind in this entry, why wasn’t dad or myself affected? I don’t know, but I would love nothing more right now than to get a root beer float with my mom.\*\*

5/13/2024

I can not believe what a great day I’m having. Just one of those days where I feel so refreshed and alive. I really shouldn’t be so rough on myself. I don’t have to settle for anything just because I’m not certain of where to take my life yet. I’d probably really enjoy learning a trade. Owning a skill could give me something to actually be proud of. That sounds like a pretty worth while goal to me. I’m going to start browsing for different programs I might like right now!

\*\*Ok... happy for you, me. But why am I so slap happy here. And it’s pretty weird that I have no thoughts on how my mom and brother are acting the day after it being the only thing I logged about? Well, I’m not in any sort of trade school and this note doesn’t help me.\*\*

5/15/2024

I think there’s something mom isn’t telling me. All day she’s been in the back yard, just staring out into the woods. I went out to check on her, I asked if everything was alright and she just gave a soft

“mhm.”

I’ve never seen her like this, It has me really worried someone might have died. Dad doesn’t seem to notice at all. He’s weirdly chipper. He was going on about some renovations he want to make on the house? Maybe he knows what’s happened and distracting himself is how he copes. I’m just going to give them their space and hope they tell me tomorrow.

\*\*I have to be insane, these things couldn’t have happened. But their rooms are here, they should be here. I should fucking remember. So, still assuming these notes can be trusted. Why the fuck am I not talking about Erik at. all. If he was gone or went missing at this point it would explain my moms behavior. But there isn’t any project large enough to distract my dad from the loss of his son, he wouldn’t act like that. Maybe Erik’s mood improved and we went back to normal, so I just didn’t mention him in my entry. But something is making them focus on those woods. I don’t want to start taking my train of thought there yet. I need to focus on snapping back to reality and remember what has been going on.\*\*

I think mom has been sitting in the backyard all night. She was sitting out there when I left for work yesterday, just before 10:00 pm. I got home a little while ago and she’s still out there. I went out and told her how worried I was about her, I tried getting her to tell me anything about what happened. She didn’t acknowledge I was there at all. It looks like dad didn’t try to help even a little bit. The backdoor deck is completely torn down, and there’s new materials he bought laid out on the lawn. This all has me really depressed and tired. I’m just going to go to bed.

\*\*I feel broken down. Please someone help. It’s only 7:00 am here so I can’t reach professional help, I left a voicemail with a psychiatrist office, but who knows how long I would have to wait for an appointment. I don’t see a scenario where I take myself to an emergency service that doesn’t end with me being committed or in handcuffs. I’m begging anyone with expertise to help me understand.\*\*

5/18/2024

I heard the most beautiful singing last night. His voice was angelic and vibrated through the crisp air. I was pretty drained coming back from work, but I feel so revitalized now. I think I’m gonna wrap up this entry and give dad a hand with that deck.

\*\*I hate you. I hate you so much you clueless, unhelpful, fucking bum. WHY. WHY AREN’T YOU SEEING WHATS GOING ON OR TELLING ME SOMETHING THAT MATTERS\*\*

5/20/2024

I thought dad would be more excited about the deck being finished. He’s worked on it non-stop all week. Though he slowed down and rested yesterday, I worked on the finishing touches and thought he’d be happy to see it. But when I woke up he was sitting on it just staring off into the distance. I went out to say hello, kinda hoping he’d be excited to see it done. He wasn’t at all. He seemed upset. I hope it isn’t with me, he wouldn’t talk to me at all. All he muttered as I was leaving was something like

“he isn’t coming.”

I’m really anxious and worried about him. We definitely don’t get much company out here, so I’d be bummed too if he was expecting someone to visit. I’m gonna invite him out somewhere on my next day off. It gets lonely out here and we should spend some time away.

\*\*

I’m done. That’s the last note. I’m not crazy or delusional. I’m finally going to face reality. Who ever that man is did something. I don’t know what, I have no reasonable explanation. But that fucking freak did something. Did he drug them? Did he come into MY home and steal MY family? Did he steal my whole life right in front of me?

If anyone believes what I’ve recounted here and decides to come and try to hunt that abomination of a man, you’ll have to beat me to it. I’m going to wait out in those woods till night fall and I’m going to break his limbs until he tells me everything. Then I’ll burn him in the very house he’d robbed of life. I don’t care what happens to me. I’m going.
