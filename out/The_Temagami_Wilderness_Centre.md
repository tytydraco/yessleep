Most of my life, I’ve been into the outdoors.  As a kid I was a boy scout because I had a chip on my shoulder about being a girl, a ‘junior naturalist’ with the royal botanical gardens and seemed to always have a frog or snake or bug if I was taken into the woods.  The only real camping I’ve done, though, was through the Temagami wilderness centre when my parents offered to ship me off for the summer between grade 9 and 10.  They showed me the website for the centre and I was sold.  Couldn’t wait. 

To this day, I’m still not sure if they knew this or not, but it turned out that the Temagami Wilderness Centre was actually one of those boot camps for bad teens; it was a remote school to keep kids from getting in trouble.  They hadn’t really advertised themselves this way, so there’s some plausible deniability but, I don’t know.  Sometimes I think my parents knew.  I wasn’t a bad teen or in any trouble at that time so I took it as an innocent mistake.  Even one of the other kids who came on trip hadn’t known the nature of the centre so it was possible. 

Our guide was an Italian guy named ‘Franco’ who looked and sounded like Tony Montana from ‘Scarface’.  He was pretty great.  Our group had only four campers: Keoni (a kid from Hawaii who looked exactly like Rufio from ‘Hook’), Jeff, Alex (the other kid who hadn’t realized what kind of camp this was) and myself.  They also had to hire a female guide named Brooke because I was a teenage girl and it would look bad for me to be out in the middle of nowhere with all these guys.

Before getting out into the wilderness, we had to pass a few tests just to prove we could paddle and carry a canoe, were familiar with a wanigan (my neck still hurts) and could handle a full food barrel.  Franko assessed our tent unpacking and packing and wanted to see our swimming abilities.  Since he’d already gone camping with Keoni and Jeff, who were residents at the centre, he only wanted to see how Alex and I would do with pulling ourselves into a canoe from deep water. 

Brooke and Franko rafted up and Alex and I slipped into the water.  We were getting into position when the canoes started drifting away.  We both swam towards them, since we’d be left stranded in the middle of the lake if they got out of reach.  While trying to catch them, I looked up and saw they were drifting even faster, so I sped up.  Alex, on the other hand, when seeing the boats drifting further and faster, had given up and stopped swimming.  I made up the distance, pulled myself in the canoe awkwardly and we went back to collect the other camper.  Franco made a big deal about this, and how our attitudes could be the difference between life and death.  I, he said, would survive.  Alex, he said, would not.

Franco’s tests continued throughout the trip and it quickly became a joke that he was trying to kill us.  He sent us on portages with slippery rocks, encouraged us to cliff dive into very unsafe water and even wanted us to identify mushrooms we could eat for dinner when we clearly had no idea what we were doing.  He had us paddling in enormous waves, and even at night.  It was on a trip to beaver mountain, though, where things got too real.

According to google, ‘Beaver Mountain in Temagami refers to the Beaver Mountain Trail, a 6km return hiking trail known for its natural surface and difficult terrain’.  As someone who climbed it firsthand, I can attest that this is an accurate description.  The top quarter or so was basically nothing but scramble and even some completely vertical areas that were straight up rock climbs, which we did with no safety gear.  Franco, Brooke and the two kids from the centre had made this climb many times and quickly outpaced Alex and I.  I was having a difficult time climbing a particular portion of the mountain when I looked behind me and didn’t see Alex.  I called out for him.  Nothing.  I called several times and still there was no reply.  I was in no position to go back down because I wasn’t sure if I’d make it up again.  I decided the best thing I could do would be reunite with the others and have us all try to find him.  Maybe he was fine.  Maybe it was just another one of those things where he’d given up and I hadn’t.  Maybe we’d find him back down at the bottom. 

As it happened, though we never did find Alex.  In fact, not only did we never find him, it seemed that everyone was celebrating his absence.  Keoni, especially, even congratulated me.  Back at camp, he rolled a cigarette and handed it to me, saying ‘good job, not everyone comes back from beaver mountain’.  I was 12 and didn’t smoke but didn’t seem like refusing was an option, so it was my first cigarette.  I was confused and terrified, watching everyone lounging at the campsite while Alex was God knows where.  I tried staying up all night but was exhausted and couldn’t. 

In the morning, all of Alex’s gear was gone and there was a heavy downpour.  We packed up as usual and got going on the lake.  Everyone acted like nothing had happened and I worried I’d gone insane.  Again, Franco seemed proud of me.  ‘You did great,’ he told me in the canoe, ‘no more tests!’  I don’t think I said a single word for the next three days and prayed we’d just get back to the centre as soon as possible. 

On our final night, Franco woke us all at around midnight, saying we should pack up and finish the last stretch right then instead of waiting until morning because the northern lights were out.  The water was calm, the sky was beautiful and everyone was at ease.  I just went along with it until, finally, we reached the dock in town.  At this hour, there was nobody anywhere except for the van from the centre to pick us up and take us back to base. 

Alex was the first to greet us.  I was shocked but also relieved.  ‘Alex, oh my god, how did you get back here?  What… where were you this whole time?  Did someone pick you up or something, I don’t understand.  I thought you were dead!’  He looked like Alex, but something about his reaction was off, like he were drugged or something.  ‘I’ve decided to stay’ he said.

That didn’t answer my question.  ‘That doesn’t answer… are you… okay?’ 

‘Ya, I’m fine.  I’ve decided to stay.’ He repeated.   

Nothing about this seemed okay and I was shaking and praying the entire day to see my dad’s jeep pull up and launch myself into it.  Just before this blessed sight would come into view, Franco took me aside.  ‘Here,’ he said, ‘this is yours.’  He handed me [a feather](https://imgur.com/a/E5aDV8g).  ‘It’s the feather of achievement.  We don’t send people back home very often.  You’ve earned it.’

On the drive home, I couldn’t help but pick up on the irritation in my dad’s voice.  ‘So you didn’t want to stay?  You didn’t like it there or something?  How about next summer, want to go back?’
