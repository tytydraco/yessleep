I don’t know if I’m allowed to post here anymore. I've deleted the original story now — I thought maybe it would stop this — but it’s too late. She’s still coming.

Please, if anyone knows anything — please.

The story was stupid. It wasn’t even scary. It was called **"The Glitter Queen"**.  
I posted it about three weeks ago.  
It was meant to be campy — a cursed queen obsessed with fame, who killed people with their own reflections if they didn’t clap hard enough for her beauty.  
I thought it was funny. I thought I was being clever.  
But now everyone who interacted with it is either dead... or missing.

**The Glitter Queen** isn’t like anything I made up.  
She’s *worse.*

When she appears — and she does — it’s never head-on.  
First it’s a shimmer, like someone shaking a broken disco ball just out of sight.  
Then the smell hits you — burnt sugar, cheap hairspray, and something rotten underneath, like a dead mouse baked in the sun.

When you finally see her —  
Her skin is lacquered in cracked pink glitter, like she was dipped in glue and rolled across a stage floor after prom.  
Her mouth is slashed into a permanent, too-wide grin, stuffed with jagged glass teeth that glint when she talks — if you can call it talking.  
Her voice is a wet, sticky whisper, like she's chewing bubblegum made of tongues.  
She’s tall — taller than human — walking on sharp bone-heels that click-click like stilettos made of ivory.  
Her hair is a snarled beehive mess, crawling with tiny gold-spider jewellery that twitches when she moves.  
And her crown — her bloody, sagging crown — leans low over one eye, like a joke she’s in on and you’re not.

She doesn’t attack like a monster.  
She performs.

Every death was... a show.

Jason, my best friend, was first. He was found *posed*, spine bent backwards across his desk chair, a mirror glued to his face. His final expression was *forced* into a grin — lips torn wide, eyelids pinned open with glittering pins.

Hannah, who always helped me edit, drowned in her own kitchen sink — but not normally.  
They found her stuffed inside, headfirst, with a "Congratulations!" sash wrapped around her waist like she had just won a pageant in hell.  
There were glittery footprints all over the counter.

Mark — poor Mark — was found at the bus stop.  
Crowned with a tiara *melted* onto his skull, his arms yanked upward as if he was mid-applause he never finished.  
The coroners said it was "like the bones burst outward from clapping too hard."  
No one could explain it.

Even strangers — people who just *commented* on the post — started vanishing.

One girl who DM'd me about the story was found in her bathtub, buried under three hundred pounds of cheap costume jewellery.  
The official cause of death? "Crushed by excessive accessories."  
That's what they actually wrote.

Another guy who joked in the comments — he ended up impaled through the chest with a sharpened beauty-pageant scepter, left on the stage of his college auditorium.

I deleted the post a week ago.  
I thought maybe... maybe it would stop.

But tonight, there’s glitter under my door again.  
It *moves* if you watch it long enough. It twitches like it’s breathing.

And somewhere down the hall — I swear to God — I hear the faint clack-clack of her heels, getting closer.

She’s not just a story.  
I *crowned her*.  
I *made her real*.

I can smell hairspray...and hear her tapping on the walls — three sharp clicks, like the start of a runway walk — and I know I’m next.
