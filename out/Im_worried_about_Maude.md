I’m worried about her. It’s been two weeks since she came back from her hiatus. When she returned, I asked her many questions, but it was unproductive. She doesn’t talk to me unless she *feels* like talking to me. The day she left things were particularly chaotic in the house. 

Her mother had just died and her whole family was at our home trying to plan the funeral. She was standing at the sink doing the dishes. I tried to take the task from her and told her she could go talk with her family. All she said was, “No, I’ll do them.” Her family was talking at our table which is just past the wide doorway that separates our kitchen from the dining room. She seemed tense and overwhelmed, which was understandable given the circumstances, so I didn’t think anything of it. I tried to insist on taking over dish duty, gently touching her shoulder, but before I could get any words out, she took the glass dish she was washing, raised it above her head, and smashed it on our kitchen floor. Her family and every other corner of our house fell silent. She stepped around the glass and went into our bedroom. I didn’t follow her. 

“Must’ve slipped,” her father said tentatively. I started to clean up the glass and as I knelt on the floor carefully scooping up the shards, she exited our bedroom with a suitcase. 

“I’ll be back before the funeral,” she said coolly as she walked out the front door. The funeral was scheduled for 4 days from now, so we were all confused as to where she would be for that time. 

I tried to call her, left voicemails, and sent her a myriad of texts but, I received no response. 3 days passed and she returned. She looked very disheveled. The first thing I noticed was that she didn’t have her suitcase with her. Her normally well-manicured nails were chipped and dirty. Her hair, which was usually shiny and well-groomed, was now frizzy and tangled looking. Her clothes were covered in unidentifiable filth.

“Maude what happened?” I asked gawking at her. 

“What do you mean?” she asked back. I was so shocked by her out-of-character appearance that I was actually glad she didn’t answer my question. 

Later that day when I had slightly recovered, I tried to ask again, “Where did you go?” But she didn’t answer. She just continued ironing the dress she was going to wear to the funeral the next day. She had a complicated relationship with her mother, this much I knew to be true. They had the same favorite color, lavender, which was also what she wanted to name our daughter if we ever had one. They also shared the same nose, smile, hair color, clothing sizes, and favorite desserts. 

Maude and her mother were very close when she was young, and she had considered her mother to be her fiercest friend. But she grew up listening to her mother critique and judge herself, and she couldn’t help but start making the same judgements about her own body. Her mother was sometimes cruel. On more than one occasion, she mentioned to Maude that she should try diet pills and recommended that she start getting preemptive Botox. Maude started to hate hearing from friends and family how much she resembled her mom even though she knew it was true. She loved her mom, of course, but still, she couldn’t stop herself from growing up and out of their relationship. When Maude heard that her mother was in the hospital and may not make it, they hadn’t spoken in 3 years. So, I didn’t push her because I knew that the next day would be one of the most difficult of her life. But something felt off. Something felt fundamentally off.

The funeral went smoothly. Wishes of condolence were made and tears were dabbed away but not Maude. She didn’t cry a single tear and barely spoke a word the whole day. Yes she was in grieving, but the following days were more bizarre than I expected. She started wearing her shoes into the house which used to be one of her largest pet peeves but now she would leave them on even if they had mud on them. She also started leaving lights on in rooms that she wasn’t occupying which she used to pester me constantly about when we first started living together. These strange new occurrences I chalked up to grief until it started branching out from bizarre to disturbing. One day I walked into our room and watched her as she plucked a white moth off our wall and place it, papery wings and all, onto her tongue. She closed her mouth and swallowed. “What the fuck Maude?” I exclaimed.

“What the fuck Quinn?” She replied and walked right past me out of the room. 

She also started watching me sleep. It seemed like every night at one point or another I would wake up and see her large almond eyes staring down at me. She had a look of confusion or shock that I was lying there in front of her. When I would ask her what she was doing she wouldn’t say anything so I would roll over and try to go back to sleep. I can't prove that she's responsible for this but I started noticing dead animals showing up in the same spot at the edge of our woods. First it was a mouse, then a bird carcass, then a squirrel. All their bones piling on top of one another. The second week after her return, I had just come home from work and walked into the living room to see her dropping a lit match onto the rug. It was a vintage rug and it caught fire quickly. I ran to the flame and stomped it out. By the time I was done stomping, Maude had already left the room and was heating up some leftovers in the microwave. After the match incident I was worried for her safety, so I called her father and told him about some of the things that were happening. 

“Well … she’s like her mother. She’s … sensitive … you know? She’ll go through phases … You just gotta be there for her,” was his sage advice. 

Now after two weeks of continually more concerning behavior I’m scared to leave her alone. “Maude, I’m worried about you.” She didn't look up from her task which was picking the last of her nail polish off her nails. “Maybe we should call Dr. Sumowski and see what she thinks.” She had been going to therapy once a month for the last two years. “Grief can be really hard to deal with on your own.”

“And what am I grieving?” 

“Maude come on.” She finally looked up at me, and again she looked surprised at my presence in our home. She walked out our sliding glass door and laid in the grass. Maude hates dirt and insects which is why, despite my love for it, we have never gone camping together. But now I stared at her as she pet the ground and rubbed her bare feet against the grass. This woman whom I have loved for over a decade is unrecognizable to me. That’s her face and her gentle hands and her chocolatey hair but it’s not her.

Last night was the final straw for me. I woke up around 2 am and assumed I would open my eyes only to see Maude's staring right back, but she was gone. Panic took over my body as I frantically searched the house. I flung open every door checking closets and the bathroom but couldn't find her. I didn't let my mind drift to the horrifying possibilities considering her recent behaviors. I was practically running through our living room when I paused at a slight movement through the sliding glass door. I looked to the yard and past it towards the edge of the woods where I could see the back of my wife's head through the dark. She had left the glass door slightly ajar. I walked out into the cold night wind and made my way to her. As I got closer I could hear she was whispering. "Maude what are you saying?" I asked. She startled at my voice but went back to the whispering. I could see her clearly now her feet were caked in mud and her hands were in a similar state. Her hair was a mess of leaves and twigs. Then I saw something move in front of her. I couldn't make out a distinct shape because it pulled away into the woods almost as quickly as I saw it. It was so fast it's possible I was just seeing things in my flustered state. The next thing I knew Maude was reeling around, shooting straight past me back to the house. Stunned, I followed her back in to make sure she went to bed.

The next morning I called her therapist and asked her to make a house visit. Hopefully Dr. Sumowski can tell me something comforting and make me less scared to be alone in our house with her.
