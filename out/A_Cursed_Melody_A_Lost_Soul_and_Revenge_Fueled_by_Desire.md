I should’ve never gotten involved with this piano business. From the very beginning, I had a feeling something was off—but you know how it is; sometimes people take the most dangerous paths just to fill a void, without even realizing it. It's not about the music. It’s about the loneliness. Maybe I just wanted to drown out the echoing silence in my home.

I’ve been living alone for three years. No visitors. Nowhere to visit. The only human contact I have is the cold, polite greetings exchanged at work. I’m a teacher. A music teacher. Throughout my life, melodies have been my most loyal companions. But lately, strangely enough, nothing I played seemed to bring me any joy. It felt like even the sounds were avoiding me, hiding beneath the keys.

That’s why I decided to buy a piano. One I could play freely in my own home, even in the late hours of the night. But I had no money. Or rather, my salary was barely enough to entertain the thought of buying new furniture.

I spent days scrolling through online listings. The prices? Insane. Even the lowest quality pianos, with yellowed keys and scratched bodies, were double my budget. Despair was becoming a habit when suddenly, that listing appeared.

Polished wood, elegantly carved legs, like something straight out of the Baroque era. Despite its elegance, the price was unbelievably low. Fifty dollars. I rubbed my eyes, checked the date, refreshed the page. Still there. Still fifty dollars. I looked at the photos over and over again. Taken from every angle—the inside, the outside, the keys, the finish. Everything was extraordinary. It felt like a bad joke, yet… something inside me kept whispering that something was wrong.

Still, I messaged the seller. My fingers were trembling as I typed. How strange… It was just a piano, but I felt as uneasy as if I were ordering a gravestone. The man replied quickly. “If you cover the transport cost, I can send it right away,” he said. I agreed. He sounded confident, but something was off. His messages were short, rushed. He didn’t say anything unnecessary. He gave me the address. That was it.

On the day of delivery, I arrived to find him in the middle of moving out. The door creaked open, and I saw boxes, half-empty shelves, stacks of books. He was definitely moving, but… he didn’t have that look of relief people usually wear when they leave a place behind. It felt like he wasn’t leaving a house, but escaping a memory. As we talked, and I approached the piano, I couldn’t hold back.

“You’re selling it for so cheap… there’s nothing wrong with it, is there?” I asked, my voice trembling a little.

Our eyes met. Sweat beaded on his forehead, and he didn’t answer right away. He cleared his throat.

“I’m moving… it won’t fit,” he said. But something was missing in his voice. The words didn’t come from deep within—they were just lip service. A script.

As the piano was loaded onto the truck and carried down the narrow apartment stairs, it paused so many times I lost count. But I just stood there, watching. Even then, the strange feeling inside me stirred. I thought, “Why doesn’t this piano feel like it belongs to me yet?”

When it arrived at my place, I placed it in the corner of the living room. The afternoon light filtered through the window and hit the keys, and the entire room lost its silence in an instant. It felt as though something invisible had entered, thickening the air.

I sat before it. Reached out and played.

The first note—it didn’t just vibrate the strings, it vibrated something inside me.

As I played that first melody, something loosened within. It wasn’t my fingers playing, it was the rusted memories of my childhood. A strange peace filled my chest, but curled within that peace was a thread of unease. The piano’s sound was extraordinary. Soft yet deep, old yet flawless. The tone felt familiar, like a stranger you instantly trust.

I played for minutes on end. My hands got used to it, the melodies flowed, time seemed to bend. When I finally looked up, it was past midnight. My fingers were numb, but the emptiness inside me felt a little less hollow. I gently closed the lid, leaned in, and whispered:

“We’re not done yet, you and I.”

I headed to bed. The house sank into silence. But that night, it wasn’t true silence. The walls seemed to breathe, the dim light of the lamps flickered. The curtains swayed gently—though the windows were closed.

“You’re just adjusting,” I told myself. “A new object, a new sound… your brain is tricking you.” But my heart didn’t believe it. I fell asleep with difficulty. And every time I drifted deeper, I awoke again—as if someone were counting my breaths.

And then… that sound.

A high-pitched, trembling note from the piano. Then another, and then a chord. My eyes opened. I sat up, a lump in my throat. At that moment, I realized—I wasn’t alone in the house.

I got out of bed in the dark. My feet crept across the wooden floor as the house watched in breathless silence. I stopped at the living room doorway.

There, on the piano, was my cat. Her white fur glowed like a pale ghost in the moonlight. She was pressing the keys with her front paws. Random, unintentional.

I let out a deep breath, caught between relief and irritation. “You again? Scared me half to death,” I whispered. She turned to look at me, but her gaze… was strange. It lasted too long. As if she were trying to say something. I picked her up. Just as I was turning to leave, the piano’s lid slammed shut with violent force. The sound echoed through the room, and the strings resonated with a haunting tone—like the sob of a graceful woman.

I couldn’t sleep that night…

My cat’s gaze wouldn’t leave my mind. And the sound from the piano—it hadn’t been random. There was a pattern in the notes. As if something was being told. A story, a sentence… or a call.

By morning, my eyes were bloodshot from lack of sleep. I looked at myself in the mirror. Exhausted, yet oddly eager to sit at the piano again.

I made my coffee, opened the curtains, and sat down. I dusted it off, placed my hands on the keys. I began playing. Slowly, I played the first melody again. Then something else… something I’d never played before. The melody wasn’t in my mind, but somehow my hands knew it.

And then…

Something whispered from beneath the keys. Maybe it was just the wind. Maybe the creaking of old wood. But a voice inside me rose:

“You didn’t choose this piano… It chose you.”

The next day, after work, my feet carried me straight to the piano. As if nothing else I did that day mattered. As if my very existence continued there—between the keys, within its frame, in that strange silence.

Before playing, I decided to clean it a bit. Just for peace of mind. Maybe I could understand why the lid slammed shut that night. Maybe a spring was loose, maybe the old wood couldn’t hold itself up anymore… I needed to believe something rational. Not out of fear—at least, that’s what I told myself—but for sanity’s sake.

I grabbed my tools and gently opened the lid. Inside… it was like a forgotten tomb, once filled with music. The strings looked like cobwebs, the wooden body had surrendered to moisture. But what struck me most was the smell. A faint scent of burnt metal… but older. Not mold, not dust. More like… the scent of something waiting. Patiently. Silently.

As I wiped the inside, something shimmered. Just a glint at first. I thought it was a staple, but as I looked closer, I realized it was paper. Wedged into the piano’s inner frame. I pulled it out with trembling fingers. Yellowed, crumpled paper. A melody was handwritten on it. Very old notation. Like a code.

But the strange thing? There was a note scrawled along the edge, faded but still legible:

“When this melody is completed, it will complete you. Or completely end you.”

A tingling started in my gut. Logic said, “Leave it.” “Tear it up. You don’t have to play it.” But curiosity… is the easiest way to lose your mind. Especially when something unexplained is involved.

I looked at the score. Then at the piano. Then back at the paper. Eventually, I gave in. I sat down.

And I played.

The first key… rang out with a strange resonance. Its sound lasted just a bit too long. I felt like something else in the house had answered it. The walls, maybe? Or the heart of the house.

The second note was deeper. I thought I saw a shadow stir in the corner of the room.

Third… fourth… A melody began to take shape. Strange, unsettling, but captivating. It pierced me. The tones echoed inside my head. With each note, it felt like something was peeling away within me.

Midway through, my hands started trembling. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something in the living room. Someone standing, watching me. But when I turned, nothing. I faced the piano again. The notes weren’t in my mind anymore—they were in my hands, playing on their own.

And then I got tired. I don’t know why… maybe the unsettling tone wore me down. I wanted to switch to another piece. At that moment—

The piano lid slammed shut on my hands. A sharp crack. One of my nails split. I tried to pull back, but for a moment, it felt like the piano didn’t want to let go.

Instinctively, I stood. The stool fell back. My left hand throbbed. I stared at the piano. Silent. Just dust… and that cursed melody echoing in my mind. Inside, I felt something strange: As if I hadn’t played it—something had pulled it out of me.

And in that moment, I understood.

This piano was not made to be played.

This piano… was made to listen.

The next night, I sat still for a long time, staring at the piano. My fingerprints were still visible on the keys. It stood there as if nothing had happened the night before. As if it had all just been a bad dream… But even dreams have an end. This didn’t. That melody still echoed inside me – that incomplete, unsettling, imprisoning melody – it kept looping in my mind. I had to play to silence my thoughts. As if it wasn’t just music, but the key to breaking a curse. As if finishing it would set me free.

I hesitated for a while, but eventually, I gave in and sat at it again. My fingers touched the keys gently at first. Then faster, more passionately. The notes didn’t seem to come from within me, but rather into me from somewhere else. It wasn’t up to me. My hands weren’t mine anymore. They had already made the decision.

The melody no longer felt familiar. I wasn’t playing from the sheet anymore. The notes were being born on their own. My body had become an instrument of the piano’s will. My eyes welled up, but I didn’t cry. It was more like a drowning sensation. The keys hurt my nails. But I couldn’t stop. My hands felt glued to them. Literally glued. The more I tried to pull them away, the harder they pressed.

Suddenly, the bench trembled. No… it moved. Not backwards, but forwards, towards the piano. It was pulling me in.

I wanted to get up, but it was impossible. My hands were magnetically stuck. My knees buckled, but the bench remained still. My legs were shaking, but my hands pressed even harder on the keys. The sounds I produced were no longer music, but screams. Strange, piercing, the scream of something alive.

Then, I felt a sharp pain in my left thumb. A jolt of pain shot through my brain. My eye felt like it would pop out. My nail… had come off. All the nail beds were red. Blood was seeping between the keys. I wanted to scream. I couldn’t. My mouth wouldn’t open. My tongue felt like it had been shoved back. Like a fist lodged in my throat. I couldn’t breathe, but I kept playing. My fingers trembled rhythmically over the keys. Ignoring me, my body, my mind.I lost all sense of time. I don’t know how many hours passed. I just remember darkness falling before my eyes. My connection to my body slowly faded. I was becoming the sound of the piano. Or maybe the sound itself was consuming me.

And then…

Suddenly, the bench pushed me back. I was thrown violently. My hands were freed. My palms burned. My breathing slowly returned to normal. But… I heard a sound.

A whisper.

Not from nearby. From within.

"You must feel it."

I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t. My fingers were bandaged, but they were still trembling. I stared into my eyes in the bathroom mirror for a long time. My eyes felt like they belonged to someone else. I was still me, but something else… something foreign… was inside. As if a piece of the piano had broken off and slipped into me.

Three in the morning. My eyelids grew heavy. I couldn’t resist and collapsed onto the couch. As soon as I fell asleep… it began again.

I was in a truck. The far wall was rusted, chains hung from the ceiling. I was being held by my ankles. Both of them. The same two men who had once moved the piano. They had no faces. In place of faces… were piano keys. The keys moved up and down. Laughing, it seemed. One grabbed my wrist, the other my arm. They dragged me toward the piano in the back. The same piano. Exactly the same. Bloodstained. Cracked. My fingerprints still on it.

“No!” I tried to scream. It only echoed inside me.

The lid opened on its own. The cursed melody I had once played poured out again. But this time, the notes were reversed. As if someone had turned them inside out. The sound… it resembled a human voice, but not one that came from a mouth. From something without a mouth. The truck started moving. I jolted. They pushed me toward the piano. I couldn’t resist. My hands… touched the keys again. 

And again… I had to play.

I woke up abruptly. Eyes wide, throat dry, drenched in sweat. I got up. Without thinking, I grabbed my phone and called two people. “Take this cursed thing out of my house. I don’t care where you take it. Just… let me never see it again.”

They came. One was young, the other in his fifties. “Don’t give it to anyone,” I said. “Burn it, bury it, destroy it.”

The young one smiled and shook my hand. “As long as you pay, brother, we can dump it or donate it.”

They loaded it into the truck. The back door slammed shut. They left. That night I thought I slept peacefully. But true peace… had been erased from my vocabulary.

In my dream, I was there again. The same truck. The same chains.

But this time… I was the one being loaded into the back. And where it was going.

No one knew.

Life, somehow, continued. It had to. I took long walks to clear my head. I didn’t speak to anyone. I couldn’t explain this to anyone. Who would believe me?

If I said, “I played the piano, and my hands wouldn’t let go,” they’d laugh.

If I said, “My fingers moved on their own,” they’d tell me to take my meds and lie down.

So I stayed silent. Swallowed it all.

I buried the fear deep in my eyes.

So it would never come out again.

Months passed. Slowly, I started to recover. My fingers regained their flexibility. I began giving private lessons, teaching children basic notes. As long as I could control the sounds, I could control the fear.

One day, through an old acquaintance, I was offered a music teaching job at a public school.

I accepted. Maybe, for the first time, I would do something “normal.” The school was a two-story, worn-out building a bit outside the city. When I entered, a crumbling corridor greeted me. But what really mattered to me was the music room. The vice principal handed me the key. “It’s a bit messy inside, but it’ll shape up,” he said.

I opened the door.

The room was dim. Curtains drawn. The air was heavy. In the center, something covered in a white sheet stood. I thought it was a table at first. But as I got closer… the shape became familiar. A strange excitement crept over me. I tried to suppress it.

I grabbed the sheet. Lifted it slowly. A cloud of dust rose into the air.

And at that moment…

My heart clenched like a fist in my chest. It was that piano. That cursed, hell-spawned piano.

The same scratches, the yellowed marks on the keys, the crack on the upper left corner…

It was the same.

The piano that once took my fingers, then my mind, then nearly my life. I backed away. My breath caught.

But inside me, a voice – a very old one – whispered:

“Maybe this time… it’ll listen to you.”

I stepped forward again. Touched the keys. A sharp, high note rang out. Like a child whispering. Just as I was about to pull away…

The white sheet in my hand came to life. As if someone grabbed it…

It wrapped around my neck.

Started to squeeze.

My throat clenched.

I couldn’t breathe.

My knees gave out.

Right then, the door opened. The principal. His eyes widened, and he rushed toward me. The sheet was still around my neck, but loosening. I collapsed to the ground. I tried to speak, but my tongue wouldn’t move.

The principal, voice trembling, said, “He did it himself… like he was wrapping it around like crazy.”

Then came the ambulance.

Then IV fluids.

Then a week in a psychiatric hospital.

Diagnosis: Crisis-induced temporary dissociative hallucination.

That’s all.

That’s all, apparently.

If you believe it.



When I got out of the mental hospital, the weather was cold. But I didn’t feel cold.

It was as if I had forgotten how to be cold. Besides, I could no longer tell the difference between feeling something and not feeling anything.

There was only one thing inside me: the desire to end it.

I had to finish it. If I didn’t close this book, that piano would eventually either drive me insane… or kill me.

There was something inside it. It wasn’t a sound. It wasn’t even music. It was a presence. Something with emotions, desires, a will of its own. A will infused into the piano’s wood, its string system, maybe even a long-hidden fragment buried inside.

And I… I had met that will. I hadn’t seen its face, but I had felt its fingers. It had passed through me. When school was out, I returned. I didn’t tell anyone. I waited for the sounds of students leaving, seeping between the doors. They left. The principal, the janitor, the guard… all gone. As night fully descended, I slipped inside.

I brought three things with me:

A bottle of gasoline…

a cigarette.

And a lighter.

When I entered the music room, my eyes looked for that white cloth again, but this time, it wasn’t there. The piano was there. Standing like a coffin.

My footsteps echoed. I circled around it. Poured the gasoline gently — on its wooden surface, between the keys, beneath the pedals…

I lit my cigarette.

That tiny spark would either save me or dig my grave.

I took a drag.

And flicked the butt.

The flames were cautious at first. Then they spread everywhere. A soft crackling began in the room. Just like… just like the primitive creaks that came when playing the piano.

A voice inside me said, “It’s over.”

But at that moment, I felt a drop of coolness fall from the ceiling.

Sprinklers.

It was as if the school’s nervous system refused to let itself die.

 Water poured.

The fire died.

And I just watched.

Only watched.

I approached the piano.

It had burned… but it was alive.

Like a monster.

Wounded but furious.

The next morning, the principal didn’t even look at me. I didn’t look at him either.

That evening… I found an old, rusty axe in the schoolyard. I wasn’t going to speak to it anymore.

I wouldn’t play it.

Wouldn’t listen.

This time, I would strike its body.

I entered the room.

Locked the door.

And started swinging.

With each blow, the wood cracked. With every crack, I thought I heard a scream.

Was it real? I don’t know.

But when I stopped hearing the pieces it used to play, when I saw its shattered body…

I knew.

It was just wood now.

I was exhausted. But for the first time, there was real silence inside me.

A hum in my ears…

But nothing in my soul.

Zero.

Finally, zero.

I went home. While struggling with insomnia, the idea of buying another piano came to me.

But this time it would be something proper.

Not cursed.

Beautiful.

Clean.

I opened the internet.

And at that moment…

The entire screen froze.

An ad popped up.

Something that shouldn’t have appeared — not within my filters, not in my budget, not from outside my city…

The exact same photo.

The same piano.

Fifty dollars.

Same address.

Every muscle in my body froze. It was like someone was pressing on my shoulder.

But there was still one spark left inside me. This time, I would ask. Without fear.

I messaged the seller.

Pretended to be a new buyer.

Got the address.

This time, I brought something with me.

My grandfather’s old war pistol.



I knocked on the door. The man who opened it wasn’t familiar. But his face wore a strange expression. Not smiling, not threatening. As if he already knew everything.

“Come in,” he said.

And I entered. For answers. And maybe… one last nightmare.

The moment I stepped inside, the house was nearly dark. The curtains were drawn.

No air flowed. It didn’t feel like a home — more like an abandoned stage.

Everything felt ready and waiting.

The man who had let me in walked ahead. As I looked at his back, something inside me stirred — an unnamed familiarity. And yet, terrifying. I couldn’t clearly see his face; he never fully turned.

He sat on one of the couches.

I remained standing.

My gun was in my hand, but in that scene, I didn’t seem like the one holding the weapon.

It was him.

In his eyes… his silence… in this strange atmosphere…

Then he spoke:

“You played it too, didn’t you?”

“What?” I said. It wasn’t a question — it was a scream.

“The notes. That sheet. Every hand that plays it leaves a trace… and each trace calls to the next.”

My breathing grew erratic.

“You… you gave it to me. You knew what it was.”

The man squinted at me.

Now, there was an expression on his face.

Weariness.

But older than death itself.

“I didn’t give it to you,” he said. “It chose you.”

“Who?!”

“The Pianist.”

I froze.

This had to be a joke.

But inside…

Inside me, that deep voice… quietly agreed.

“Who is the pianist?”

“He was once someone like me. His hands bled. His nails tore off. His sleep was shattered. Something seeped into his soul and swallowed him. But the worst part… one day, the music stopped. So he sought other hands. Wrote down the notes. Found someone to play. And with each new player, a piece of him returned. Until… he was fully awake.”

My throat dried.

A bitter taste in my mouth.

As if all the truths were rising like blood in my throat.

“You… did you play that piece too?”

The man lowered his head.

“I did. I couldn’t finish it. I ran. But he didn’t forgive me. And I know… he won’t forgive you either.”

I pointed my gun.

Not from fear anymore.

I was afraid of losing my mind.

Afraid of walking that line.



“Just tell me the truth. That piano… what is it? What does it want from me?”

“Your voice,” he said.

“Your voice. The pure feeling at the tips of your fingers… It doesn’t just want to be played. It wants to live.”

My head spun.

The walls were closing in.

I had to sit.

That melody…

It started playing again in my ears.

But this time, I realized—

The melody wasn’t mine.

But it played from within me.

“How do I stop it?”

“It doesn’t stop. But you can. If you don’t accept it, if you don’t live with it… maybe you’ll just forget. Maybe… after years, it’ll feel like just a nightmare. But you’ll always stay alert. It’ll always watch. Just like now.”

He turned his eyes to the window.

So did I.

The curtains slowly opened on their own.

And outside…

On the corner of the street…

A truck was parked.

The same truck.

The one that brought the piano.

The one that took it away.

The one from my dream.

There was no one visible in the driver’s seat.

But the engine was running.

Smoke was rising.

Then something hit me.

“I’ve… been here before, haven’t I?”

The man smiled.

One of those fatal smiles.

Like the mouth of a grave.

“You have. A long time ago. And you asked back then too. And you didn’t believe. Then you pretended to forget. But it… doesn’t forget.”

I stood up.

There was only one thing left: escape. Maybe running wasn’t salvation… but forgetting might be a chance.

I headed for the door. But before I left, I turned one last time.

“What’s your name?”

“I have no name anymore,” he said.

“I’m just… the bearer of the sound.”

And I left.

When I stepped into the street, the truck’s headlights turned on. But it didn’t move. 

It just sat there. Like a memory.

Forgotten, but never erased.

Since that day, I never played the piano again.

Never touched a note.

But that melody still echoes in my ears.

When the night gets quiet, sometimes I hear a piano from the other end of the house.

I don’t get up.

Because I know:

I’m not the one playing.

But someone is.



And with every note…

they’re getting closer.
