***



My watch said it was 10:00 am, but it felt like dusk. The pine trees were so numerous and thick that I could barely see the sky. 

I looked around the dirt road and surrounding forest. There were no pylons, no signs, no washrooms, or anything. The only reason we knew how to get here was because Konrad’s phone had the GPS coordinates. I thought there would at least be a gear tent, or a food truck awaiting us. Instead it was just a shallow ditch containing a truck, a van, and my crappily parked ‘95 Civic. 

“Kon, are you kidding me? Isn’t this supposed to be union?" 

"Polska Federacja Filmowa,” he held out a crumpled call-sheet. “PFF. It's a Polish film union. It’s a legit co-production." 

I almost wanted to laugh. How ridiculous. A foreign indie film starving for crew. Konrad was clearly desperate to try and find a boom op with a vehicle and had run out of options. 

"You motherfucker." I said. There was no way this would qualify in my logbook. 

He just shrugged. It's not like I was going to drive the two hours back into Vancouver and not get paid. He was here. I was here. Sound needed recording. 

I grabbed my backpack and boom pole, following Konrad to meet my new co-workers for the day. The crew was milling about under the shadowy trees, unbothered by the gray darkness of the forest.  

Some folks raised their hands, acknowledging Kon’s arrival, he waved back. "Sorry we're late."  

The tallest of the crew, a six-and-a-half-foot giant with blonde hair, gave a subtle nod and patted Konrad’s shoulder. "Nie ma problemu."  

The giant then turned to me and asked, "Jak się masz?" 

He looked like an unused character from *The Matrix* trying to blend in with the forest. Black trench coat, camo pants, slicked back hair, the works. I assumed he was maybe the lead actor based on the getup, or maybe a villain. 

"Oh she doesn't speak Polish," Kon said. "But don't worry, she's amazing. This is Anna Lee. She's a dear friend of mine. We went to the same film school. Anna, this is Olek, the director." 

*This dude is the director?*  

I raised my hand. "Hi." 

Maybe he had cast himself in the movie (which might explain the strange outfit), but regardless he extended an open palm. "Hello amazing Anna, welcome to our crew." 

Olek’s face maintained a blank expression. It felt as if he were observing my reaction to his presence. I shook his hand with mock confidence, a little shocked by how chilly his fingers felt.  

For a second, I thought I should joke about the cold, or comment on the long drive here, or literally say anything to break the ice, but the moment passed, and Olek dismissed me with a nod. 

I nodded back and waved at the rest of the crew behind him. Although not quite as decked out as Olek, everyone was also wearing some degree of black, or borderline gothic attire. They waved back, mirroring my non-committal energy and resumed chatting amongst themselves.  

A crewmember with a baseball cap started handing out walkie talkies and speaking loudly in Polish. Konrad told me this was the assistant director, and he was saying we should all stay on channel one for on-set communication, channel two for side-conversations, and if any one of us got lost in the woods, channel one was for emergencies also. 

“Lost in the woods?” I said. “We’re a crew of like eight total—aren’t we just sticking together?” 

“Oh absolutely.” Konrad said. “There’s no reason for anyone to separate. It’s just a precaution.” 

Perhaps overhearing us, the AD switched over to English for his last couple mandates. “And please don’t forget to respect the forest. We do not want to upset the nature or have any park ranger come interrupt us. We want to avoid this. And most importantly of all, please give lots of room to the mourner for the scene. She needs lots of space.” 

I turned to Konrad, lowered my voice. “Mourner?” 

“Oh. Hah. I think he meant *performer*." Konrad pointed to a girl in a gray dress, sitting on a log. Behind her was what I assumed to be the makeup artist adding hairpins to her braids.  

"Polina is our actor for the scene.” 

— 

We trudged along, single file through the bush. There was tall grass everywhere, the kind you can barely lift your foot over (and not to mention brambly vines to make it more fun). The further we went, the more I started wondering how the assistant director up front knew where he was leading us. Was he following a compass? Or just winging it? 

Konrad was making small talk in Polish with the makeup artist ahead of him, discussing the schedule or perhaps the previous day. I knew they had been shooting for three days already, and had about twelve more to go, which is relatively normal for a single location horror movie. 

What wasn’t normal was wading this deep into uncharted parts of a forest with no path, no signage, and no clear way back.  

I was worried that no one in the outside world would know where we were. If something bad were to happen (like a mudslide or deluge or something) it would be really difficult to try and get any sort of help. *Did someone bring flare guns? Did anybody bring bear mace?* 

I didn't want to be the baby who came to complain, but I had to voice my concern somehow. So I waited until Konrad had finally finished his conversation, then casually whisper-spoke. 

“Hey Kon. So did they get a permit for this place? Is there some record of us being here?” 

Konrad laughed. “Anna come on, we’re just going to a meadow.” 

“I know but I’m worried about safety. Like does someone have first aid?” 

“The camera team has a first aid kit, yes.” He pointed behind us, at the two men lifting a massive gear case. “They’re also carrying our lunch. Including a lentil sandwich just for you—I told them you were vegan.” 

“Oh. That's nice.” 

“Trust me, everything is copacetic. Just focus on your job.” 

—

According to my watch, the trek only took about thirty-five minutes (although it definitely felt more like an hour). Eventually all the dense foliage fell away and opened up into a very sizable meadow, which despite the overcast sky, still managed to gleam in a sort of gray brightness. I couldn't say it was totally pointless to have walked this far, because the meadow itself was actually quite beautiful. Whoever scouted it had done a good job. 

"Okej here we go." The AD said. The camera team’s carrying case was dropped and unloaded. With expert efficiency, the tripod, camera, and bounce boards were set up for today's first scene. 

The director pointed to a large oak tree in the center of the meadow. The gist I got was that our actress was going to be praying beneath the tree in some kind of wide establishing shot. 

When I turned to the actress, I noticed that she must've fallen into a pond during our trek—the bottom of her linen dress looked damp. Everywhere she stepped, her shoes made a squelching noise, and her wavy black hair shined like wet kelp. The makeup artist was doing her best to dry her. 

"We're going to go for a wide shot of the tree," Konrad translated the AD’s latest update. He pulled me over to the picture monitor. "There will be dialogue—a chanting, and a groaning—from the actor" 

*I'd be groaning too If I had fallen into a pond.*  

From my backpack I pulled out a case of portable lavalier mics, which were perfect for the occasion. The beauty of a lav is that you can strap it to a person and record their voice remotely as long as they didn’t rustle their clothes too much. It doesn’t sound as clean as a boom mic, but for a wide shot such as this, it would be much easier to hide. 

As I went up to the actress, I considered whether I should pin the lav to her bra, or some hidden fold on her dress, but before I could even introduce myself, the director appeared with crossed arms. My path was blocked. 

"Don't touch actor. Give her space." 

"Oh. Uh. But I was going to mic her up?" 

Olek stared down with gray, disinterested eyes, looking past the tiny microphone I was holding. Something told me this wasn’t about audio. He just didn’t want me touching Polina. 

I was going to suggest recording her voice afterwards as an alternative, so it could be added in post, but then Olek’s finger unfurled, pointed at me, and then pointed at the boom pole resting on a tree stump. 

"But that … won’t work," I said. The boom couldn’t get close enough without appearing on camera. 

"Make it work."  His eyes peered into mine, and suddenly I felt a spike of fear. The trench coat seemed more menacing than before. It was a statement. *Don’t cross me.* 

Incredulous and a little uneasy, I went over to Konrad who was setting up his mixing station. I explained what the director was asking. 

"Oh, I see."  Konrad tapped his chin, and eyed Polina with a knowing look. “Yes, that makes sense.” 

“What makes sense?” 

“Well, Polina is a very sensitive performer. Strapping a mic to her might interfere with her process.” 

I looked at the actress and could only see a shivering, frightened looking girl, who probably wanted this to be over. 

“She’s what you might call … ” Konrad whirled his hand as he found the word, “A method actor. She is inhabiting her character. So we want to be as unintrusive as possible.” 

“Okay … ” I tried to keep the judgement from my voice. “Well then, why don’t you tell them they can shoot the wide silent, and we could pick up the audio with a boom in closeups.” 

"Oh I don’t think we’re shooting closeups.” 

“Well then we can record audio-only closeups.” 

“I don’t think Polina would be willing.” 

I furrowed my brows quite blatantly. This was all sounding really weird. “Well then what do you suggest?” 

“I suggest we see how close we can get you with the boom. Let’s give it a try.” 

— 

We did give it a try. Even when I stood as far away as I could, with my boom pole fully extended to six meters, there was no way for me to record quality sound—not without appearing on camera. 

After some back and forth, the director decided the solution was for me to go hide in the tree *behind* Polina. 

I won't lie, it felt a little demeaning to be asked to go squirrel up a tree. I saw myself as a soon-to-be professional in the film industry, and had this been a legitimate union set, I would have certainly said, *sorry no*. But seeing as I’ve now been wrangled into an independent film, and I was a team player…  

<Sure. I’ll take a look.> I radioed on my walkie.   
   
 

<Thanks Anna. And sorry for all the back and forth.> Konrad legitimately sounded apologetic. <I should’ve warned you how picky this crew was. They’re perfectionists. But trust me, it’ll be worth it. Olek’s films are renowned. It’ll look great in your portfolio.> 

<Sure.> 

<Just be careful not to disturb the actress as you get close.> 

<Copy that. Back to one.> 

<Back to one.> 

I flipped my walkie back to channel one, then I un-telescoped the boom pole and trudged my way to the tree. I avoided trampling too many of the dandelions because I knew they were being featured in the shot. 

*Olek’s films are renowned. Sure Kon. I’m guessing this flick will sit unwatched at the bottom of Netflix, Shudder or some adware streaming site.* 

On approach I could hear Polina chanting under her breath. It was the same couple words slowly repeated over and over again. *"Król kolców, posłuchaj mnie. Czy ja żyję? …"* 

She was standing shakily with eyes closed, both her arms extended outward, facing the distant camera, as if reaching out to it. I really wanted to tell her to *‘save it for the take’* but I knew how weird actors could be.  

I’ve seen plenty of cast who like to act as if the camera is rolling all the time, so this behavior wasn’t particularly new. I just hoped that the tears streaming from her eyes, and the slight whimpering was all part of the act too. 

Sneaking a good two meters behind Polina, I approached the base of the oak and could see that many of its branches were indeed climbable. I hoisted myself up along the trunk and pulled up the boom behind me. There were a few different nesting options, so I tried sitting across a couple branches. Eventually I found one that seemed to support my weight—while also holding the boom. I extended the pole and fished around until I found a break in the leaves that allowed me to record Polina from the side. 

*I suppose this might actually work.* 

Olek’s voice came over the walkie, sounding as cold as it did in person. <You’re out of frame. Good. How’s that for sound?> 

I slipped on my over-ear headphones and listened to Polina's chanting through the mic. 

*“Król kolców, posłuchaj mnie … ”* 

<It sounds great. Are you picking it up Kon?> 

My boom was wireless, so it directly transmitted to a receiver on Konrad's mixing setup across the meadow. 

<Kon?> 

<I'm sorry Anna, the boom reception is a little crackly for me. Are you picking up any distortion?> 

I slipped my headphones back on and played with the Mic's position.  

*"Czy ja żyję? Czy ja żyję?…”* 

<Sounds fine. She's just doing her chanting thing.> 

<Hmph Okay. Well maybe to be safe … Did you bring a pocket recorder?> 

I sighed. Of course I would be the one booming *and* mixing this morning. From my pack I pulled out my contingency H4N Zoom—a handheld recorder. 

<Yeah I've got a backup.> 

<You think you could use it—just for this scene?> 

I turned on my pocket recorder and connected it with the boom. It was stupid because Konrad should have been the one up in this tree. He’s the main sound guy. I'm just the day call. The script had never even been sent to me.  

The frustration was tensing its way across my shoulders, but I exhaled it away. <Yeah I got this. Should I be aware of an upcoming scream or anything?> 

<It should just be chanting. And groaning. Maybe some wailing.> 

I had my fingers on the gain dial, prepared to lower it for any wails. 

<Okay. Well the boom is in place. My feed is clear. On with the show.> 

— 

The first two takes went off without a hitch. On both occasions, Polina would start with her chanting, progress to a sort of chant-groaning, and then culminate in a wailing before the director yelled ‘cięcie!’—which was apparently *cut* in Polish. 

I adjusted my levels on the mini mixer each time to compensate for Polina's volume because the last thing I wanted was for the sound to peak (and therefore be unusable). After each take, I would also poke my head through the leaves to check in on the actress. 

Each time Polina would be standing in the same position, breathing hard, recouping her energy for another go. It was weird, but I guess this was her process. 

For the third take, Olek wanted to swap a camera lens, so I took a moment to review the audio I'd recorded thus far. The first file sounded fine. Polina's voice was basically clean save for some light wind, bird, and bug sounds. Pretty much perfect. But in the second recording there was this super distant, very faint, barely noticeable … *squealing* noise. 

As I scrubbed through the waveform, I could hear the squealing ride overtop of Polina's vocals. Drowning them out at times. It honestly sounded like some lone, wild pig had been crawling across the meadow, rearing its haunches, and squealing over and over. 

*What the fuck?* 

I listened to the rest of the clip. It definitely sounded like a pig, a big one too, maybe a boar. The squealing continued throughout, and towards the end of the recording it hit such an uncomfortably high pitch that I reflexively threw the headphones off and almost slid down the tree. Leaves and acorns fell all around me. 

<Anna you alright?> Konrad radioed from my hip. 

<Yeah, I’m fine. I just umm, I just need a second.> 

Navigating the small LCD screen of the mixer, I checked if maybe I was re-recording over existing files. Maybe the squeal had come from an old audio track? Maybe I had overwritten something corrupted? But the SD card was clean. Nothing looked wrong. 

<I uh … had some strange interference in the last take> 

<Interference?> 

It felt counterproductive to try and explain some out-of-place pig sound, so I decided to save the embarrassment. <Yeah, I lost Polina's performance to some … artifacting. But I'll reset my device so it shouldn't happen again.> 

<What about first take?> Olek radioed in. <How was that for sound?> 

<Oh the first take was still good. First take is clean.> 

<Then we're good.> 

<Copy that.> Konrad said. 

<Okay. If that’s fine with you, it’s fine with me.> I said. 

<Great.> The AD then joined in. <The lens is ready, actor still in position. Let's roll camera and sound!> 

<Copy.> 

<Rolling.> 

<Speed.> 

I shook my head free of pig thoughts and pressed my headphones against my ears. 

The mic still held its good position. I could hear the breathing of Polina as if she were right by my side. She took several sharp inhales, held her breath, and then slowly exhaled. 

Across the meadow I heard the director clear his throat, and then yell: “Actcja!” 

Polina’s chanting came quick and succinct, arriving with a bit more intensity than before. She must've known that they were going for a different shot or something because her words had completely changed. 

*"Król kolców, posłuchaj mnie. Ona jest twoja i tylko twoja.”* 

I listened intently for anything off, dialing back the gain as Polina’s vocals grew louder. There wasn't any pig noise or disruption, but for this take, Polina had started to cry during her chanting. And it wasn't the usual ‘actor crying’ I had seen on some TV movies or soaps. It was more of a grief-stricken sobbing. It sounded deep and authentic. The sobbing then turned into bawling, and quickly became hysterical.  

I told myself it was just a performance, and that I shouldn't think twice. 

The sobbing then turned into wailing. And then the wailing faded under brisk, heated shuffles, as if she was wrestling something. As if she was fending off an animal. 

Mid-wail, I heard her fall and get up multiple times. I heard her strain, as if she was struggling to brush something heavy off of her. Then after a final cry she stopped the performance altogether and made a heavy thud. 

After Olek yelled cut, the first thing I did was peer through the branches to check on Polina.  

She was on her palms and knees breathing hard, with a pool of something (vomit?) on the ground next to her.  

At the side of her dress, at about hip height, I saw a tear in the fabric, and a large dark stain. I squinted to see if there was a wound, or if she was actively bleeding, but from my height it was impossible to tell. 

<How was that for sound?> Olek radioed, indifferent as usual. 

I stared at the waveform I just recorded, then I quickly scrubbed and listened. It was the same hysterical performance. No distortion. No pig. 

<Good for sound> I said, hesitating to add more. I brought my walkie closer to my mouth and took a deep swallow. <Is ummm … is Polina okay?> 

I held a branch away so I could see Polina breathing. She hadn't fallen over or anything, but she certainly wasn't standing either. 

<Polina did great. Amazing performance> Olek kept his radio bursts short. <What is your question?> 

I stared at the blotch on her dress. It looked like it was growing. <Like does she need our help or anything?> 

<Help?> 

The radio stayed silent for a time. Then Konrad came on. <Hey Anna. Go to two.> 

I flipped channels. <Go for Anna.> 

<Hey. What’s going on?> 

<I’m just … it sounded a little real coming from Polina last take.> 

<Real? You mean the performance?> 

<Yeah. Like should someone check on her?> 

<Hey Anna. You do realize this is a movie right?> 

*No shit Kon.* <Yes I just—she looks like she's bleeding.> 

<Anna, it's called makeup.> 

<I didn't see any makeup artist come up.> 

<She did, in between takes. While you were in the tree.> 

I didn't think I had heard anyone come up, but then again, maybe I was busy reviewing the audio. I just assumed Polina was alone the whole time. 

<Well I … I was just worried that's all.> 

<Didn't I tell you we were shooting a horror?> 

I would describe Konrad as a nice guy. We get along and I like him as a friend, truly I do. But on set he could be a total prick. 

<Okay Kon, fuck you too. I'm just by myself in this tree recording screaming from an actor that I can't see. Sorry for being overly concerned about another human being … > 

<Sorry, I didn’t mean to come off rude.> 

<It should be you in this tree anyway.> 

<I mean if you’re uncomfortable … you want me to switch with you?> 

I did actually. I really did. But then I envisioned what I would have to do. I'd have to climb down, wait for Konrad to get over, get Konrad setup, and then get myself out of frame. We'd waste over ten minutes, and we've only been shooting for twenty. It's still only the first scene. The AD would not be happy, and most certainly Olek would not be happy (which I didn't want to witness). Worst of all, everyone would know I was scared, and that would be fucking embarrassing. 

<No I'm fine. It's fine. I'll be fine.> 

<It's okay. You're gonna be okay.> 

<Yes. Back to one.> 

Polina was still on all fours, so I just had to assume this was her new starting position. I let go of the branch and allowed leaves to obscure her once again. I sat down, readied my mic, and flipped the walkie to channel one. <Okay, it's all good everyone. I've sorted it out. Sound is ready.> 

Almost immediately the AD responded. <Great. Let's go for another. Roll camera. Roll Sound.> 

<Copy.> 

<Rolling.> 

<Speed.> 

"Actcja!" 

Even sitting in the tree, a whole field away from the crew, I could still sense the irritation in the director's voice. 

I tried my best to distract myself by listening to the audio and treating all sounds as objectively as possible. Nothing was too authentic. It was all just performance. 

Polina's chanting came fast and hard as before. *"Ofiara jest blisko. Ona leży na drzewie. Twoje do wzięcia!”* 

Her words were different too, but I just had to assume Olek had given her new directions. Nothing surprising. Nothing to be worried about. 

She started to cry again. And this time quite aggressively. 

*“Nie! Nieeeeee! Nieeeeeeeee!”* 

And not only that, but she actually got up and ran away from her first position. I could hear her run around the tree, her voice growing and shrinking each time she circled by the mic. Obviously this wasn’t great audio, but I didn’t want to be the one to interrupt the take. So I did my best to adjust the levels on the mixer. 

*“Ja tego nie chciałam! Ja tego nie chciałam* *…”* 

Then, of all things—the squealing came back.  

It was large and wet, as if the creature had a nose full of phlegm. It started to circle after Polina, chasing the actress’ wet shoes as they slapped against her feet. 

I was gripped in my seat, and I stared below at the ground of the tree surrounding the trunk. I searched for the shadows of Polina’s legs, for the trundling of any hooves, but I couldn’t see anything, it was all happening outside the leaves of the tree. And beyond the leaves of the tree, I could only see faint silhouettes. I was too scared to push the branches aside. 

My mic was picking up the circling of these two entities. The shrieking, terrified voice of Polina, and the heaving, snorting *thing* right behind her. 

I wanted to drop my mic, headphones and all my gear, but I was paralyzed. The pig-beast sounded too angry and purposeful to be any animal. The word ‘demonic’ rattled in my head. 

Then I heard a small crack—like snapping of a celery stick, or a bone. There came a stifled inhale, a stumbling sound, and the worst, most vicious squealing I’d ever heard.  

Polina was screaming no doubt, but she was barely discernible beneath the shrieking peals of the stomping hog. It sounded like a hundred bats were coalescing to form one ungodly screech after another. Over and over again. 

Tearing sounds. Ripping sounds. Biting. Crunching. Eventually, the only thing that proved capable of pausing the squeals was the amount of chewing the monster had to do. 

Burping and scraping came next, and a disgusting number of slurps. Somehow this thing had known to park itself perfectly beneath the microphone as it ate. The feasting was being recorded with utmost clarity. 

I looked at my pocket mixer. This had been going on for over four minutes now, and no one had said anything, the radio stayed completely silent. I watched and waited as the pig grew quieter as well. 

Chewing turned to gnawing. Gnawing turned to licking. And in time the licking grew so faint, it felt like it had blown into the wind. 

I listened for anything more, for a final snort or retreating of hooves, but all I heard was the rustling of grass and chirping of birds. 

“Cięcie!” 

I shunted away the arms of leaves and stared at Polina's spot. The rags of her gray dress lay there in a pile, surrounded by trampled grass and signs of struggle. No beast. I leaned forward on the branch for a better look, for any signs of flesh or blood. Then something rammed the tree. 

Branches and twigs smacked my neck as I fell. The ground arrived hard, punching my tailbone. 

As fast as I could, I rolled over to standing and looked for any signs of a large animal, squeezing the air back into my lungs. 

There was nothing by the tree. Nothing in the meadow. The wind snatched at my clothes. 

My headphones still dangled around my neck, and I heard the faintest of murmurs. With a light touch, I brought up the left earpiece to my ear and listened close. Squealing. 

Although my microphone had fallen on the ground behind me, somehow it was still picking up that pig sound. 

Then, there in the distance, I could see it emerging from the crew. A large black shape galloping toward me. 

I bolted in the opposite direction. 

<Co ona robi?> 

<Anna, where are you—?> 

I don’t know what was behind me, or how close it was, but I had to get away. The oak was not safe. The crew was not safe. 

Without much thinking I ran straight for the forest’s edge and started to weave between other trees, hoping to lose my pursuer. 

But the pursuer was fucking fast. And as it chased, I realized I wasn’t running away from any sort of forest animal or boar. There were only two feet tearing behind me. It was a person.  

Feeling my heartbeat in my throat, I jumped over some fallen logs and turned back to catch a glimpse. 

*Oh my god. It’s Olek. Holy shit.* 

The director stared back with a soulless leer. He was carrying something long and sharp, and his boots crushed through the forest without effort. He had chased like this before. I wasn’t the first. 

I screamed and kept running, deeper into the forest now, not really knowing where to go. He was faster than me and would catch up in moments unless I could find some obstacle between us. 

*Why is he chasing me?* 

Pond water splashed into my face as I reached a wetter area. I prayed for some swamp or bog I could use to slip away, but the ponds were just sparse little islands in a dry forest.  

But as I sprinted down a slope, I could see the opening to a steep drop. I was nearing the edge of a narrow rocky ravine. A dried up river. If I jumped over, I could probably land and cling to the opposite side, which was a rocky lip. It would definitely hurt, but I could pull myself up and maybe get away. It was worth a shot. 

I neared the edge, took two steps back. Paused. Ran forward. And leapt. 

I fell hard on the opposite stony edge, and it crumbled beneath my weight. The rocks and pebbles broke apart from the tightly packed dirt, and my hands failed to grab hold of anything.  

*Oh god what have I done.*  

The impact was immediate. All air vanished from my lungs. There was pain all along my back and tailbone which grew worse as I raggedly inhaled. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see Olek climb down toward me. I feebly tried to crawl away, but it was no use. The escape attempt was over. 

Olek’s cold gray eyes appeared menacing despite giving no actual expression to his face. He stopped a foot away from me and surveyed my wounded body—out of shock, or worry?—I couldn’t tell.  

He lowered the weapon he was holding, which I could now see was the boom I had left behind and placed it at my feet. Then he leaned close, put a hand on my shoulder and brought his face close to mine. His voice sounded ominous, yet still very much concerned.  

“How was that for [sound](https://www.reddit.com/r/EclosionK2/)?”
