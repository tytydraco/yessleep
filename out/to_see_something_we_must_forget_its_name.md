Today, I accidentally came across a quote from the artist I greatly admire, Claude Monet. I would like to share the quote as it is:

“To see we must forget the name of the thing we are looking at.”

Reading this, I couldn’t stop thinking about the concept of “names.” In fact, a “name” can be understood in many different ways, but in this article, I will focus on those “names” that are assigned to individuals, which give us an incomplete and limited image of them. We often call this “labeling,” and in English, it is called “label.”

“Label” originates from Old French, where it meant a strip of ribbon or a narrow piece of parchment that was attached to something to identify or describe it. Over time, people began to use “label” to assign a characteristic or personality trait to someone, simplifying the way we recognize people based on just one of their traits. In a book I once read about the brain, one reason people use “labels” is that our brain wants to save energy and therefore tends to simplify everything. Unknowingly, we also tend to “label” others. However, humans are not objects, and even objects can serve multiple purposes. Even a “label” for an object might need to describe it in more detail, let alone a human being. Yet, these “labels” continue to spread everywhere.

For example, if a child doesn’t listen to adults, they are quickly labeled as “a bad child, no one can teach.” But few people are patient enough to stay by their side and understand what the child is really thinking, why they behave that way, or what valuable qualities they have. Or some children go to school, and just because they don’t get high grades in subjects like Math, English, or Literature, they’re labeled as “dumb.” If they’re lucky, they and their families might discover their own strengths and develop them, but if no one helps, the child may fully believe that they can’t learn well at all and stop trying because they believe they are “dumb.”

As society becomes more complex, these labels are placed on people more and more, to the point where sometimes they create confusion about one’s own worth.

I admit that I, too, have unconsciously labeled many people, and there are even times when I have lived by the labels others placed on me, forgetting my true worth. Labels were originally meant to help us understand an object or a concept. But to truly “see” it, a label alone is never enough. It’s like knowing about a tree: you know the leaves are green, and the trunk is tall. You can understand how the tree grows, but it’s difficult to grasp the gentleness of its shade, the fresh coolness when the wind rustles the leaves, or the peace the tree brings to those who rest under it.

I want to conclude this article with another quote by Claude Monet:

“Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love.”

After all, I just wish you a kinder galaxy
