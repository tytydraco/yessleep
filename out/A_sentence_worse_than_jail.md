I had recently been convicted of possession of drugs when partying like crazy at a friend's house. I was flat-out drunk when a patrol barged in and searched the house. I'm not sure if it was a warrant, but they found all sorts of drugs. I had no idea who left it there, but I was convicted. Shady business.

I arrived at the jail, instantly became depressed and suffered from anxiety every day. The bathrooms are filled with shanks and drugs, each cell has at least 1 gram of cocaine, and you could bet there was a fight going on everywhere. Crazy stuff.

I was awaiting my court date at the time, had passed a few days there. One time, some crazy guy who was probably high stole a gun and almost killed an officer. I could feel myself getting mentally drained.

But one day, something strange happened. I laid on my bed, covered in the dirty rags, when I heard tapping on the cell door. I was completely alone in my cell since my cellmates had been released a while ago. I opened it, thinking it was one of the guards. No one was there.

I headed back to bed, and as soon as I shut my eyes, the tapping was there again. I was exhausted, depressed, and overall sick of this place. I yelled "**Who is it?!**" From my bed. No one answered, but it turned from a soft tapping into a loud banging. I got up, tripping on the empty drug needles and trash scattered by me. 

As I looked out the door, I couldn't see anything, except what seemed to be a person wandering around. I scoffed, and went back to bed.

The next day, I grabbed myself a tray of food, ate and watched TV during free time. However, out of nowhere, some officers came into the room and called for a lockdown. I went into my cell, ate some snacks and waited for them. They checked every cell, but I didn't know what they were looking for. They ignored the drugs in my room, as if something else was a bigger priority.

Once they left, I went back to bed to cry myself to sleep. But, in the middle of the night, it happened again. A figure banging on my door desperately. I opened it, trembling, hoping it was some sort of hallucination. As I did, however, I had some sort of panic attack, causing me to struggle to breathe and fall to the ground.

Hours later, I woke up in what seemed to be the infirmary. It wasn't some warm place surrounded by nurses and a fresh scent, it reeked of rotten flesh and looked like an asylum. There were no other patients there aside from a prisoner who had been brought there since he had been involved in a violent fight. My bed was bloody and stank, so I moved to the one at the end of the hallway.

As night settled, the doctors left and I tried to fall asleep. But, as I was just begining to dose off, the same banging from before returned. I couldn't keep calm, I yelled, and it all went oddly quiet. The banging stopped, and was replaced by the sound of the door opening. From it appeared a man with a sinister grin, wounds that were definitely caused by a shank or something similar, and he was probably high on heroin. He approached the old man across the room, and with a sharpened plastic fork, started stabbing him.

Since it was plastic, the old man just screamed in pain as it slowly cut into his skin. It was a gory sight, I just laid there, speechless and pale. After he had finally passed away, the maniac just left the room, laughing loudly, it was easy to confuse him for the devil.

Years after the event and my release, I did my best to forget about the incident. But one day, as I was reading the newspaper, I read something that left me petrified. The same man who had traumatized me that night, commited suicide after cops arrived to his house. It was packed with drugs, corpses, and details about how he did it. Why did it leave me terrified? He did all of that in jail, with cameras around, and guards on almost every room. The infirmary had no guards, at least not at the moment of the attack. Only 1 camera which covered the end of the hallway. If I had stayed at the dirty bed, I would be dead, kept in that old house for years as I rotted away.

To this day, I still think of who that man was, and how I managed to survive him.
