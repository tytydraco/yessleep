Okay, so, hi. I don’t even know why I’m writing this down, but I guess it’s like therapy or whatever? Except my therapist would probably tell me to journal about, like, gratitude or something. And trust me, that’s not happening tonight. So let’s call this a diary entry. Or a warning. Or just me venting into the void because, honestly? I’m losing my mind a little. Also, I changed everyone's name except for TREVOR, that dumb asshole ex of mine.


Fuck him. And apparently, Trevor isn't even his real name! So his name stays fucking Trevor.


Anyway, I need to start from the beginning.


So, I moved into this house three weeks ago. Well, “house” is generous. It’s more like a… structure with plumbing that occasionally works. The rent is cheap because it’s in the middle of nowhere. Literally nowhere. I have to drive 15-*fucking*-minutes to get to a gas station, which, by the way, only sells cheap wine, Diet Coke, those stupid diseased rolling hotdogs, and beef jerky. 


Love that for me.


I should have known something was off when I signed the lease. Like, the landlord didn’t even do a background check or ask for references. He just showed up, handed me the keys, and was like, “Don’t bother calling me unless the roof caves in.” I thought that was shady, but I was desperate, and the rent was a steal, okay? 


Thanks to Trevor—my absolute waste of oxygen of an ex—I had about three days to find a place after he decided our apartment was actually his apartment.


Don’t even get me started on Trevor. 


No, you know what? I will get started.


Trevor is the kind of guy who says he’s a “nice guy” while cheating on you with his coworker who has identical tattoos on both wrists. Who does that? And then he’s all, “I just think you’re too emotionally dependent on me.” Oh, I’m sorry, Trevor, but maybe if you’d pay attention to me instead of playing Call of Duty until 3 a.m.—


Ugh. Sorry. Tangent. My point is, I ended up in this house because I had no other choice. And at first, it was fine. Kind of cute, even. It’s this old Victorian-style place with, like, creaky stairs, stained glass, original hardwood floors, cute but ugly wallpaper, and a little attic window. But it has charm, you know? Or… it did.


The weird stuff started last week.


It was little things at first. Like, I’d wake up and find the kitchen window open, even though I know I closed it before bed. Or I’d hear this faint tapping noise at night, but when I went to check, there’d be nothing there. I told myself it was just the wind. Old houses make noises, right?


But then, two nights ago, I was in bed, scrolling TikTok like a normal person, and I heard footsteps. 


Clear as fucking day. 


Like, someone was walking down the hallway outside my room.


My first thought was, Oh great, I’m about to get murdered in my sleep. 
My second thought was, What kind of psycho breaks into a house with literally nothing worth stealing? So, I grabbed the heaviest thing I could find—my bedside lamp—and flung open the door.


Nothing. No one was there.


But here’s the thing: the floorboards were creaking, like someone had just been there.


So, yeah. I didn’t sleep that night.


I told my best friend Kayla about it the next day, and she was like, “Girl, you’re just stressed. It’s probably your brain playing tricks on you.” Which, okay, maybe? But then she hit me with, “Have you considered that it might be Trevor’s bad energy manifesting as ghosts?”


Thank you, Kayla, very helpful.


Anyway, tonight is when things got… worse.


It started around 8 p.m. I was sitting on the couch with a glass of wine—don’t judge me, I deserve it—and I heard that tapping noise again. It was coming from the living room window this time. I peeked outside, expecting to see a branch or something, but nope. Nothing there. Just darkness.


So I poured another glass of wine. 
And just between you and me, this wine tastes like the good shit. Never buy pricy wine when you can have great wine for $3. And mama needs to get hammered tonight.


Anyway...


An hour later, the tapping started again, but this time it was on the back door. I froze. I mean, I froze. My heart was doing that thing where it feels like it’s going to explode, and I couldn’t move for, like, a full minute.


Finally, I worked up the courage to check it out. I turned on the porch light, opened the door, and… nothing. No one there.


But.


There were footprints.


Bare fucking footprints. In the mud.

Are you shitting me?


I slammed the door so hard I think I broke the lock. I heard something clink on the floor, but..



A. I'm blind without glasses


B. I'm nursing a glass that I don't want to put down.


C. I already looked briefly and if I can't find it in 5 minutes, it's the gnomes that took it. I'll probably find it tomorrow.



And that’s when I decided to open the tequila.


So now I’m sitting here, writing this, because I honestly don’t know what else to do. I’m too scared to sleep, and I’m definitely not going outside. I don’t even know if I’ll stay here tomorrow. Like, I could just leave, right? But where would I go? Trevor’s couch? No, thank you. God even thinking about texting him makes me want to hurl..


Oh, and get this. While I was typing all of this, I heard something upstairs.


Like, a thump.


I’m not checking it. Nope. Absolutely not. If it’s a murderer, they can have the house. 


I’ll just live in my car.


Okay, I think I’m done for now. I feel kind of sick, probably from the wine. 


Or the tequila. Or, you know, the fact that I might be living in a horror movie.


I’ll update this…
if I survive the night....

Jk, lol. I'll update when I
 feel like it
.

I don't feel too good..

Should I get a cat?
