I'm going back to my hometown to find my missing friend. I'm not sure I'm going to make it back, so I attached a letter I sent to the police chief of my hometown of Lone Stone. If I make it back, I will post here again.

  


Dear Chief Samuel T---------,

I hope, Chief T---------, that you are the correct person to contact concerning the events plaguing your jurisdiction. My name is Thomas M--------. I am originally from your neck of the woods. If you look out your department's front door and down the road, you’ll see the hospital I was born in. My mother, Emily– I’m sure you’re familiar– called me this morning to inform me of what is happening in Lone Stone. She had quite the meltdown. She rang me at four o’clock this morning– scared the hell out of me in all honesty. She screamed that Charlie had gone missing before I even thought about saying hello. I told her to slow down and explain what had happened. She said she woke up and the back screen door had been ripped off its hinges, and she saw muddy footprints leading around the side of the house and down the front driveway. I asked her if she followed the muddy tracks farther, but she said they faded away at the end of the street. I don’t know if you’ve ever met Charlie, but my uncle is not a man who would just run away. My mom is ill, and he is essentially her caretaker. So why is he just gone?

I took a quick look at your department’s website. Eight people have gone missing this year alone in Lone Stone. Five last year. Three the year before that and the same the year before. At least one person has disappeared since the town’s founding in 1889. And I know not one of them has been found. Not one body has been recovered. I’m sorry for getting off track, but I have a confession. I know where the missing are. I need you to take me seriously, no matter how outlandish I’m about to sound. For the love of God, read closely. 

I need to start in 1975. It was the summer between my sophomore and junior years, and I spent most of it with my good buddy, Jonathan B--------. He was my best friend. He was sort of an insignificant guy, y’know. About 5’4”, 120 soaking wet. Lonely. Wicked chess player, though. I couldn’t beat him. Anyway, I knew the guy since we were just kids. We met in 2nd grade, and, at first, I would go over to his house. But– around a year into our friendship– I noticed that the back of his shirt was soaked. I lifted his shirt to find his back covered in leaky, bloody welts. He told me that his dad was sad that his mama had left and that he got mad sometimes. I told my Mom about it but made her swear not to interfere. I was terrified his dad would beat him to death. My mom didn’t say anything for a couple of years, but when we were ten, Johnny’s dad broke his arm in two places. Mama saw it and took Johnny to the police station. Long story short, Johnny was placed with his cousins in four states over. 

I missed him so much over the next few years. When I was 13, he moved back. His cousins bought a warehouse in Lone Stone and planned on turning it into a skating rink. We were inseparable after he came back. The year after he returned, the skating rink had been finished for six months and was always busy. Day after day, kids would line up in twisting streaks across the hot asphalt in front of the building. Johnny and I worked there, giving people their skates, cleaning up some nasty kid’s vomit, or cleaning up after hours. The rink opened at five in the evening and closed at ten. Every night, after closing, Johnny and I would be left alone to tend to the place. We would wax the floors, scrub mold and mildew off the walls, and count the money in the register, among countless other chores. And every night, we would feel the ground shift. Some nights were worse than others. Nevertheless, the building would shake with each pound that vibrated the ground every night. 

One night, when we were sixteen, Johnny and I sprayed down the skates with “anti-fungal” spray. He was telling me about taking Valerie, the girl he liked, down the road to the drive-in later that week when we heard the sound of soft footfalls scattering and squeaking across the freshly waxed floor. We crept slowly toward the noise, our sore bones cracking each step. As we rounded the corner, we caught a glimpse of a small, child-like shape and light dash into the inky blot that leaked from the opening of the storage room. From the expanse, we heard a slamming, then silence. Reasonable minds would’ve understood that the shape was only a child, but Johnny and I imagined the worst. We approached the opening, and while Johnny kept his eyes bouncing back and forth to each corner of the room, I felt around the door frame in search of the light switch. I finally found it and quickly flipped it, jumping back into Johnny simultaneously. He let out a small yelp and faced me. I put my index to my lips and motioned him into the storage room. He didn’t like that idea, so I went in first. We spent an hour scouring the old room for that kid. The room was long, extending thirty or so feet. It was filled with extra skates, more lung-shriveling spray, and mud– thickly caked on the wooden floor. We decided to calm down and mop up the dirt. The clock was flirting with one o’clock after we finished, and we were too terrified to walk home at night. So we pulled out cots we noticed in the storage room and fell asleep to the pounding of the floor. 

The school year flew by, and before we knew it, summer had returned. We were happy to be back in the rink, spending more time with each other again. Still, the floor would rumble beneath our feet every night after closing. One sweltering night in August, Johnny and I had finished a late night at the rink and decided to pull out the cots again. We fell asleep in a flash after a busy day like the one we worked. I had a dream. I dreamt that Johnny and I were kids again. But his mom had never left, and his dad never hurt him. Johnny never had to leave Lone Stone, and we never had to spend that time apart. It was a wonderful dream. I woke up with my eyes closed but noticed a shine from behind my eyelids. As my eyes fluttered open, I saw two rotating lights plastered on the ceiling. It was still dark outside, so the light filled the room. The glow shimmered with colors, flowing between white, blue, silver, and gold. The light flashed periodically, around every ten seconds.

I looked over to Johnny, lying beside me, to ask him what was going on, but when I looked, Johnny’s eyes were open. The light was pouring from his eyes. Dread overtook me. I shook Johnny, but he gave no response. I looked at him in his lights, and my gaze was glued to the spinning kaleidoscopes that replaced his eyes. It took a minute to break his eyes' spell on me. When the bond finally broke, I fell back onto my bed. Johnny leaned straight up in bed, swung his legs onto the hardwood floor, stood, and stiffly walked out of the room, his eyes beautifully illuminating his path like dual flashlights. 

I followed closely behind, whispering his name incrementally until I was yelling at him. He didn’t break his stride. He kept lumbering down the hall, with me as his shadow. I watched him from behind. His slight figure moved through the middle of the passage while the walls, ceiling, and floor were overtaken by whirling luster. He came to a sudden halt at the entrance to the storage room. He turned to the side, faced the opening, and entered the void. His stare filled the room. When he got to the back, he moved a crate to its side and reached down to a handle on the floor. As he pulled, a wood panel on the floor lifted, revealing a ladder descending far into the ground. And I followed.

As I sank further down, gripping the ladder tightly, I thought about climbing back up and running, but I couldn’t leave my friend. I needed to know what was happening. My feet hit the bottom hard, and I turned to face the tunnel Johnny was walking through. He was yards ahead, but his light was bright enough to determine the path ahead. I followed for what seemed to be thirty minutes or longer until Johnny suddenly turned and went out of view. I panicked and ran as fast as I could to catch up. When I turned on his path, the tunnel became a massive expanse. At the far end, I could see a powerful illumination pulsating. As I walked toward it, the pound got stronger and louder with each step until I arrived, and it was almost unbearable. While the beating rattled my brain, I looked up and saw something I still can’t rationalize to this day– a wall taller than a skyscraper with people embedded into it.

From the bottom to the top, the wall was filled with writhing bodies, all facing forward with light spilling from their eyes. At the top were people wearing dress coats and handmade dresses. Men, women, and children. As my eyes followed down the wall, the attire modernized. Collared shirts and jeans. Flannel and dress pants. Until at the bottom, leather jackets and skirts. Everyone was twisted together, cemented in the stone wall. From behind the wall, a heavy push of air whistled through the void. Something was behind the partition. I could feel the power of its lungs blowing a gale opposite the barrier. The wall pushed in and out, pulsating with every breath. The sound pummeled my eardrums– the beating of the wall. My distraction was broken when a hand grabbed my arm. Johnny was stuck in the wall. His mom, I knew her face from pictures Johnny had, was trapped beside him. She hadn’t aged a day. Next to her was Johnny’s dad. He wore the same face now as he did when we were in 2nd grade. I ripped my arm from his grasp and ran away. Before I knew it, I found myself back home. 

A search for Johnny took place in the following weeks. The police had questioned me about his whereabouts, but I lied and said he had gone home before me. I was scared of what was down there. I was afraid of Johnny’s fate. I didn’t want people to see him like that. Those are excuses. I am a coward. I could’ve brought peace to countless families in Lone Stone if I had said something. But my fear glued my mouth shut. 

Chief T---------, I’m fifty years old now. I haven’t thought about what happened that night in years. But my mom went and reminded me of that awful horror. I don’t know if I’m looking for redemption. I don’t know if I want to find closure. Maybe I just want to see my friend again. But I am terrified of what’s behind that wall. What ancient curse, or derelict beast, is waiting there? But I have to. I’m catching a flight to Lone Stone tomorrow, and you and I are going to the rink, into the storage room, down the ladder, through the tunnel, and to the wall. Hopefully, we can recover all those people before it notices us. Before it wakes up. But if it does, God help us. 

  


See you soon, Thomas M-------
