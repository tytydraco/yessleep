It started again last night.

Three soft knocks at the door. Just after 2:00 AM. The exact same as it’s been for the past four nights.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

I know I shouldn’t open it. I know what I saw.

But when you hear children’s voices whispering your name in the dark, when you see their silhouettes pressed against the frosted glass, it’s hard to pretend you’re not just a little bit hopeful that it’s all been some horrible mistake.

The Wilson kids died five years ago. Their house caught fire in the middle of the night — faulty wiring, they said. By the time anyone noticed the smoke, it was already too late. The family was trapped upstairs. The whole street woke up to their screams. I did too. But I didn’t do anything.

I stood in my window and watched the flames eat their house alive. I told myself it was too late. That by the time I got outside, I couldn’t have helped anyway. But I heard the knocking even then — faint and desperate, just like now. I think it came from inside the walls.

The parents’ bodies were found together, melted into the charred bedframe. But the kids… they were never found. Just tiny handprints on the floorboards, leading to the front door. That door had claw marks in it. Deep ones.

The cops thought wild animals had gotten in. But wild animals don’t knock.

Last night, I finally opened the door.

There was no one there.

But the knocking didn’t stop.

It was coming from the walls now.

And it’s not just knocking anymore.

They’re talking.

I can hear them behind the drywall, giggling and whispering. Scraping their fingernails along the inside. They’re moving. Room to room. Closer.

They keep asking why I didn’t help them. Why I watched. Why I did nothing.

I tried to tell them I was scared. That I didn’t know what to do.

They didn’t like that answer.

I don’t think they’re going to leave this time.

My lights are flickering. The air smells like smoke. And I can see tiny handprints forming on the wall beside me.

They’re inside the house now.

And they’re not alone.

I didn’t sleep.

After the handprints appeared on the wall, I locked myself in the bathroom and turned the lights off. I don’t know why — like hiding would help. I sat in the bathtub with a knife I found in the drawer, like that would make a difference.

They didn’t try to break in. They didn’t have to.

Around 3:15 AM, the whispering started again. Not just the kids this time. Another voice joined them. Deeper. Slower. Like it was learning how to speak.

The children sounded… afraid of it.

I heard one of them say, “He’s awake again.” Then silence. And then the scratching started. Not at the walls this time — from inside the mirror.

I swear I’m not crazy. I watched as a small crack formed in the center of the glass, spiderwebbing outward like pressure was building behind it. Something moved on the other side, just beneath the surface. I turned away, and when I looked back, the mirror was normal again. But my reflection wasn’t.

It blinked when I didn’t.

I left the bathroom when the sun came up. I thought maybe daylight would push them back — like they were tied to the night somehow.

But now things are different.

It’s not just the walls.

It’s the photos too.

Every picture in my house with people in it — friends, family, even old school photos — all of their eyes are gone. Scratched out. But there’s something worse.

The Wilson kids are in them now.

Standing in the background. Watching.

One of them is behind me in the picture on my fridge — smiling. I’m in the photo too. I don’t remember taking it. I don’t remember ever smiling like that.

I left the house around noon and drove until my gas light came on. Parked in some diner lot an hour out of town. I’ve been sitting here for hours. I don’t know where to go.

But they do.

There’s a note under my windshield wiper. Written in crayon.

“Why did you leave the door open?”

I didn’t. I swear I closed it.

Unless… no.

No, I locked it. I know I did.

I’m going home now. I have to. I think whatever was with them got out. I think it’s wearing me — pretending to be me.

And if that’s true… then who’s been driving my car for the last ten minutes?
