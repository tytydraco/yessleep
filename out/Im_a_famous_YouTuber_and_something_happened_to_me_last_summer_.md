Teaser: 

I became obsessed with this YouTuber, Ricky Kayles. He uploaded a series of videos of himself while exploring the Great Basin National Park in Nevada in March of 2020.
​
He uploaded 21 videos in total before he disappeared somewhere close to Wheeler Peak and was never heard from again. His last known location is marked in red on this map. 

Kayles's videos have since been removed from the platform though nobody knows by whom. I believe that there was someone on Reddit who had saved a few of them but, anyway, they're not really important to this story. 

What you need to keep in mind is that, for two months straight in 2020, I did nothing but watch and rewatch Kayles's videos soon after I learned of his disappearance. I tried to look for clues in the videos themselves but even the last video he uploaded on 28 March 2020 gave little indication of what might have happened to him. 
​
Kayles was sprightly. He always wore a flag trucker hat that had Stetson written on it; he routinely took this off in the videos and used it to fan himself. It was March — it gets cold in Nevada in the evenings — but if you're constantly walking in warming spring weather, you're going to sweat. And sweat he did: Kayles was often breathless as he talked about what he saw in the Lehman caves and in the basin. He got romantic a few times when he stood at the trailhead and looked up at the peaks. 
​
In his last video, he was exploring a strange rock formation and some narrow cave mouth. Investigators think that this is where he might have inadvertently buried himself. 

These are, to the best of my memory, the last words he uttered in the final video: 

not kidding guys... i'm not an archaeologist but this could be the site of a sulphurous hot spring. naturally heated pool... and i read... yeah i read this old leaflet from 1910 that my grandpa had and it said that they used to sell the water they got from here because of its curative properties... *laughs* ... gotta find me some of that.
​
He was his usual sprightly and excitable self. He didn't look tired though he was fanning himself with his Stetson hat. Anyone watching that video would not have said that this would be the last time that they saw Ricky Kayles. I certainly didn't.

I decided to go to the Great Basin National Park because I had two weeks of vacation leave, I'd never been to the park, and I was curious. I am not in any shape or form trained to trek, I'm in my early thirties and not even that fit; I've never had any physical training.

I set foot in Nevada in August 2023. This is my diary from that expedition.​
