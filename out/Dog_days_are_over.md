Growing up rich was everyone’s biggest dream: five-panel white houses, maids and galore, and dipping bodies in electric blue pools, sun reflecting off. “Go to your room” was no longer a punishment as you could play with toys or watch freely on Disney Channel. My dad was a lawyer who had just moved up to a higher class. He was no longer in the yellow Manila pages on hardcover brownish leather covers that were rotting. He was on billboards and got some celebrity suing cases. My mum worked at Mattel. I remember being six years old, walking into Mattel in sparkly pink jelly sandals. My mum had just dyed her hair honey blonde to fit with the same style the company went for. My older sister called it “Stepford wives shit” when I heard her talking over a hot pink Razor phone. My life had been spoiled. The newest Barbie dolls in glossy plastic packaging. I got to meet celebrities that my whole class was raving about. Celebrities got tangled in court cases like spaghetti on a fork. Usually for song stealing, unfair work pay, etc. I got to meet some of the celebrities, i.e., Avril Lavigne, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears. Sounds like every child’s dream, right?

My parents were never there for me. Always at work, and the “I’m sorry honey I just couldn’t make it, but I’ll promise I’ll be there next time” never had a meaning anymore. They were making empty promises. My nanny was called Audrey. Named after Audrey Hepburn, or that’s what she said anyway, she was the best mother and father figure anyone could ask for.

She played me songs of the 90s that she burned on her laggy beige box computer from the 80s.
She always let me use the computer or phone; no matter how hard she needed to complete an essay. One time I was on it for more than two hours and she never complained.
When the cook was on leave every Friday, she would make us pre-made meals in the microwave. The microwave occasionally hissed, leaving the food runny and liquidy. She always had that portion and gave me the better portion.

She always wore colored basic t-shirts and maxi dresses that reached the floor. She was in her late teenage years. I remember being eight years old. My parents missed my birthday. The cook was off sick. Audrey made me a rectangle squared cake with round edges and cloudy purple frosting, unevenly painted on the cake. It had rainbow pastel sprinkles on top of the cake, a unicorn was plastered onto it and it was made with an old eraser that she cut. We spent the day getting makeovers at Libby Lu. Tinsel and glitter stained my hair. Cream eyeshadow was painted on with a sparkly finish, the same with the lips. We went to American Girl, and I chose a doll with the prettiest hairstyle and chestnut hair. We watched the Lizzie McGuire movie in a dark movie theater, screen blaring out.

I remember her telling me about her childhood. With limited resources she made my childhood and early teenhood living heaven. She sometimes drove me down to the beach, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun blaring from the CD player while other 80s songs like Material Girl and Forever Young were accompanied. Windows down, the wind brushing against my face, sticking my arms out the window to feel alive. To be alive. She smothered sunscreen on my face, arms, and legs. Running across the water and dipping my toes in the cool and growing water. Floating my belly flat in the sky, eyes fresh in the clouds.

We climbed mountaintops, running barefoot along the grass like Maria in The Sound of Music. Swaying our legs up and down in long flowy dresses like Dominique Swain in Lolita. Bumblebees crawling on bright yellow flowers as I smelled and picked the flowers. It smelled like sparkling lemonade on a hot summer’s day, mixed with spring air.

She read me books like Anne of Green Gables and pop-up fairy books. We watched made-for-TV movies and mini-series on her 80s TV. Narnia and The Children of Green No. BBC always had the best. She always read the books first. Listening to her voice, soft and warm like Mary Poppins. When I was older she read me Jane Austen. It was aesthetic in its true meaning rich warm beauty threading up my hours.

When I was 13 she vanished. Into the thin cold air. I remember it like it was just yesterday when I woke up on a lukewarm spring day. The sheer silk curtains blowing far into the bubble of my bedroom. I got up, put on my crinkly Mary-Kate and Ashley t-shirts, but I couldn’t find her. Then I was running, sneakers on hardwood floors, calling her name over and over again. My parents were on the couch. My dad reading a grey newspaper, his glasses on the frame of his nose, my mum sitting on the other couch, which was in an asymmetrical parallel frame to the couch. I asked her where Audrey was. Despite my parents not being in my life as much as I hoped them to, they knew how much I loved Audrey. She looked at me with a sickly sweet smile; “She’s not coming anymore but we’ve hired a new nanny.” You know how I said Audrey made my life heaven? Meghan made my life hell.

She pulled too hard on my hair, tears formed in my eyes as the brush went through and through again. She barely took me to the beach, and when she did, she forgot to put sunscreen on; my skin would be red, sore, and decaying. She made me watch silent films from the 20s, all month round because cartoons were, and I quote, “too childlike.” If Audrey ever did that, we would laugh and talk. It’s not like she ever would do that. Audrey loved That So Raven, Lizzie McGuire and The Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley. Meghan would barely speak; the only sound was the clock ticking its arms away. If I accidentally spoke, she would throw a spoonful of her dinner onto my freshly washed top and then make me wash the hell out of it.

She was only there for six months until I finally felt the courage to tell my parents. They immediately fired her and reported her to the council. Even though it was only six months, it felt like six years.

One day I was crying about Audrey, wishing over and over that she came back just one more time. I dreamed about her that night, and if I knew that dreams bring us together, I would have closed my eyelids for a long time.

Now I am 15. My parents needed help clearing out old boxes in the attic—boxes filled with old plastic toys. Then the box. I opened it and it filled a part of my life fuller because of the essence of beauty and nostalgia. Not twisting corridors filled with murder monsters but a strange haunting dreamscape. An unfinished fever dream. I grabbed hold of a polaroid photo with a white square lining around it. It was of me playing with my dream house, Audrey next to me.

I took hold of a photo with Audrey looking down at a book, smiling. You could see the snowy mountains in the background. That was the long weekend Audrey took me down to the mountains. She said her dad took her down when she was little. We ran barefoot on the grass, smelling freedom in the air; feeling the cool breeze hit my face, joy and free spirits.

A vanilla note caught my attention. It read in old messy writing “17 Willow Street” — Audrey’s address. I gasped for air. I had been wanting to find her like a lost soul forever. When I was drowning in schoolwork, I told my parents I was going to my best friend Sofia’s house.
Her house was a government-funded house, packed with others in the background. Drug addicts and drunken drowning, a rehab trash fairytale. The stair steps had black dots. And the walls were a ghastly shade of yellow. I waited outside the door, feet pressed against the cracking concrete. I knocked, and a frail old woman, wearing an off-white cream-colored dress with small cherries, said, “Can I help you, dear?” I could barely move or breathe for a second. “Uh, yeah, sorry, I’m looking for Audrey. Uhh, she used to nanny me.”

Audrey stood in the frame of the hallway, mouth agape. I ran to hug her, sneakers slamming on wooden hallway floors, and suddenly the warmth of childhood sun blankets my skin, and suddenly the autumn breeze sends red leaves along my path, and suddenly the whole world is like a pine tree stood against the brisk day—childhood—and suddenly those days come running back like an old sports tape, and suddenly they rush in like a soft beachy tide, and suddenly the wind flutters through the old pine tree, still standing proud. Childhood. Childhood innocence. Time that swept away too quickly is now here, still standing. Even though I’m 15, I can still go back if I want to.

We went into her bedroom. She had a mattress on the floor and a duvet with Winnie the Pooh on it, and posters of Radiohead, crinkled and falling by dirty blue tack on the walls. She hadn’t talked yet and was just silent. “I missed you.”

Despite my tiredness, I listened to her. I cried uncontrollably, as if she brought back all my memories and my life when I was happy, and it is as if my concern is nothing and no one can upset me. And from now on, the whole world is on my mind and I blame my parents, but I cannot become a human being except from the past. I was happy and laughing and not upset. Forever and now, it is calm, cold, and discreet.

We talked for what felt like hours, until the sky turned a red clay color and the sun arched over my view. A call from my phone buzzed and whined. “Where are you?” my mum’s voice cracked through the line.

“I told you, I was at my friend’s house. Maybe if you actually cared to listen to me, you wouldn’t call me.”
I hung up on her. Tears filled the flesh through my eyeballs—subtle, but not subtle enough.
“Are you alright?” Audrey said. She brushed away her hair from her forehead and a smile cascaded up her lower cheeks.
I put my palm up to my eyes, watery black liquid showed visibly on it, leaking through the gaps of my fingers onto my white silk skirt.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” I say, but the urge of my throat is begging me to say no.

On the sleepover, it was just like when I was young. We played board games. I didn’t complain when the red pasta sauce blocked my view of which number I was on in Monopoly. I didn’t complain when the television stopped working right throughout the suspense, although I have just realized now I’m being negative.

When I slept, there was a quiet thud on the doorstep.

“What was that?” I asked with a whimper.

Her face looked scared for a moment.

“Relax, it’s probably just a cat or something. We have them a lot around here. Poor Mrs. Dollywire gets them but hardly ever looks after them. Good thing she’s going into a nursing home soon because mother can’t afford any more—”

She raises her head, ironically like a cat.

Footsteps.

“Audrey…” I struggled with my voice to stay in tact.

“What. Is. That.” My voice is cold like popsicles that she used to keep in the freezer. They were colored ice and its grains drained into my mouth.

“Anastasia… go in my closet… now.”

I almost flinched when she called my name—Anastasia. She barely called me by that, only if there was severe danger, and that’s when I knew I had to go.

In the closet were old pictures of me and the dresses she used to wear, long modest outfits. According to the hateful media eye, however, they wanted skin, especially from women. I learned this a few years ago in a clothing shop. That’s when I realized what a misogynistic society we live in to this day. I was almost thinking about the joyful memories when I started to hear this menacing tone of a close, sacred whisper.

“Auuuuudreeeeeeeyyyyyy.” It stretched out. It was definitely a man’s voice, not an old perverted one. Not some messy drunk teen playing around, but it sounded eerily similar to a 28-year-old’s voice.

The door swung open.

“Hi Audrey.” A man’s voice said. His voice startled me. I forced myself not to scream, so a silent gasp rattled against the bones of my ribcage.

She didn’t speak at first. I could faintly hear her cold breathing, kind of resembling when you were going to school in elementary, but it was so brisk and so cold that when you breathe the cold air resembles smoking, or vaping—that’s what I used to do at least.

“Y-y-y-yeah,” she finally stuttered out.

He closed the door behind him.

“I got a restraining order against you. This is breaking the law. I’m going to call the cops.” I heard her pull a phone out from her pocket.

“Oh no, you’re not!” She runs at her. Fake, as a taunt.

I jokingly think at that moment that we owe Zade Meadows an apology. When I hear this sound, that drains all the funny thoughts from my mind.

A knife. A sharp one, that is. It won’t just pierce through her skin. It will pierce through the air too.

A tackle, a frightened yelp comes through the air.

“What if I were to do something with this?” A smirk creeps and crawls along his facial features, seeping through his frown.

Audrey doesn’t respond.

“Ok then, I’ll do it for you!”

I ran out of the closet and put my hand to the knife. It stopped midway.

The pain throbs in my throat, and my leftover skin feels numb.

He stops, then he runs out of the house, leaving the blood-soaked metal shards across the ground. He had pushed it so hard that the knife had broken into tiny pieces, shining like I had smeared the sun onto them.

It had not fully impaled only half, but the pain was blinding my eyesight to the point where I feel like I might even die.

“Stay with me, Anna, stay!” Audrey squealed out.

One last dreadful loud scream went up my ears before the room cascaded into black. No, not black, ebony, maybe even darker, like dead ashes.

What felt like an eternity later, a strange, unfamiliar white fabric filled my nostrils. I awoke in a hospital bed, lace pressed into my hand.

I shot up.

“Where are my parents?!” I said.

The nurses exchanged looks of cringe, showing their teeth through the white light.

“They’re not here… they couldn’t make it.”

Despite everything, I cried, as if all the anger and tears had finally let go inside of me. I had spent all my days defending them, saying, “Maybe they will change.” But I cried instead and screamed out:

“Fuck them! They were never there for me.” And I sank my head into the putrid-smelling pillow and the cotton melted my tears into it, lukewarm.

A familiar shadow crossed the pathway of my eyesight. A girl in a messy bun shaping the entire shadow of grey. A long maxi floral skirt—

“Audrey!” I leapt up, not even bothering the pain that centered around my body.

It wasn’t her, rather her almost-killer. She was holding him though.

I have never wanted to kill a man more than ever before, or a human for that matter. Not even Charlie Davis when he kicked a soccer ball at my head and Meghan said how much of a crybaby I was while lazily sticking dollar store Elsa band-aids on my forehead, and the blood dripping out of it.

Not even when my friend said “the party will be here,” when in reality it was a drug addict’s house. She didn’t want me at her party and laughed after.

I punched him, so his cheek became numb. I punched him until the nurses held me back. The real Audrey comforted me and told me that he would be sent to prison for ten years.

I hugged her then, crying happy tears, and then my mother walked in.

“Honey, I’m sorry it was just a late night shift—”

“I don’t give a fuck whether you’re sorry or not. This is your own daughter, you barely make time for anything. You know how much that’s hurt me throughout my childhood and shut me down like blinds. I hate you and my deadbeat dad! Get the fuck away from me and never talk to me again.”

Her face went paper white and she uttered an apology before her feet slammed on the tiles and she shut the door.

In the end, Audrey will always be my real mother. I know this might sound typical and I know this might sound sad, but I’ve said Audrey more than my parents in this entry, or story as we will like to call it. There is no harm in calling her the mother.
