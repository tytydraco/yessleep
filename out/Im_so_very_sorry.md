If there hadn't been a towel on the floor outside of the bathroom then I wonder how long it would have taken me to realise that there was something wrong with Ben. Would he have left me, once he realised that this wasn't all going to blow over? As it is I walked past the bathroom door and saw the dirty towel on the floor, thrown there to be washed later. I scowled at the door and at the boyfriend who was muttering something to himself behind it. He'd said that he was going to move the towel 'in a few minutes' when I'd seen it earlier but that was hours ago. I should leave it there. I should. It wasn't my towel and he said he'd move it and I shouldn't have to tidy it away for him...

I bent down to pick up the towel. My lower back grumbled in pain and the action that would have been swift and effortless only a couple of years ago was a slow, cumbersome reminder of my useless body's insistence on betraying me. With the towel now in my right hand I was about to turn to head to the washing machine when the word *'sorry'* made my ears prick up. Ben's voice was soft and audible, not the usual way he'd spit out an apology like an insult. I was surprised that he'd apologise for leaving the towel here but he kept speaking and I realised that wasn't what he was sorry for.

*"Sorry, I shouldn't have stolen the chocolate or claimed that Amber had eaten them all and forgotten, I sh-"*

"What the fuck!" I yelled back through the door.

It might seem an overreaction but these were fancy chocolates that I'd looked forward to all week and I *knew* that I hadn't eaten them but Ben was so adamant that I had that he'd eventually forced me to believe him. The door flew open and Ben was looking at me with more panic in his eyes than guilt.

"I can explain." he said. "Not about the chocolates but... Please, I need you to hear me out."

I wasn't happy about it but Ben looked genuinely worried. He gestured for us to go to the other room rather than continue to stand awkwardly outside the bathroom door. When we sat down to talk I realised that the towel was still clamped in my hand and looked down at it pointedly but he missed my expression.

"I didn't mean to apologise." Ben said.

*What the fuck...*

A beat later and Ben had registered the anger on my face.

"No! No, I mean of course I'm sorry. I shouldn't have eaten your chocolates. But I- you know yesterday, when I was hanging out with Adam?"

I nodded. Adam was probably Ben's best friend. He'd been my friend first â€“ the Joseph to my Mary in the school play, the guy who'd gotten our friend group beers when we were too young to get them ourselves, my little sister's first boyfriend and the only childhood friend I was still in contact with. Ben had initially hated Adam and was convinced that surely the only reason we hung out together was that one or both of us actually wanted to date the other but eventually that suspicion faded and now they're closer with each other than Adam and I ever have been.

"He was acting weird. He seemed really nervous and when I went into the kitchen to grab us both a beer he just started apologising for things. Like how he drove home drunk a couple of weeks ago. Once I came back into the room with him he stopped and he couldn't explain it. At first he said that it doesn't happen as long as somebody's looking at him so I could stay as long as I didn't leave the room but it seemed crazy so I just came home."

My confusion was fogged over something that I should have picked up on in that last sentence.

"I think I've caught what he had." Ben said.

"So what? You're just constantly apologising if nobody is looking at you?" I asked.

"No, not always. I'd only been apologising for a few seconds before you yelled at me."

"Right..."

It was actually too crazy to disbelieve. Ben had lied to me before and whilst I probably didn't always catch it, none of the lies that I had caught were nearly this elaborate or outlandish.

"Are you mad at me about the chocolates?"

I laughed. Any anger I'd felt at that had been overruled by the weirdness of everything else he'd said.

"No, I'm not."

Ben smiled.

"I guess there are some benefits to dating a Christian."

I used the towel in my hand as an excuse to leave the room at that statement. Ben had always used my religion as a way to feel superior to me, even though I'd never criticised him for his atheism. I didn't care what anybody in my life did or didn't believe but strangely neither did Ben, most of the time. Adam didn't get the same snarky comments for his brand of 'mostly just weddings and funerals' Christianity as I did for going to church every week, even though he was much, much more likely to bring his faith into the conversation. One week after Ben had proposed to me he'd emphasised that he couldn't possibly marry me in a church even though I'd never asked. Wedding venues were sort of a moot point anyway though as it had been a year with no talk of the logistics of a marriage ceremony and I was beginning to believe that he wasn't going to marry me anywhere.

Ben followed me out of the room and I wondered how much of his out of character clinginess was him trying to stop me from staying annoyed at him and how much was that he was genuinely scared that if he left the room then he'd start saying things. He stayed in the kitchen with me as I began to prepare dinner and even chopped some of the vegetables.

"We could watch that romcom you mentioned tonight?" he suggested.

"Alright."

He used to go out of his way to do things for me but recently even acts of kindness as small as offering to watch a film he didn't love were so few and far between that a strange giddiness wriggled in my chest. Things seemed good and I was happy until I had to leave him alone to go to the bathroom. As I reached the living room door he began to speak and maybe it was a violation to hear what he'd apologise for next but I needed to know. I stayed perfectly still where neither one of us could see the other.

"I'm sorry that I slept with Carla. I'm sorry that I lied about where I'd been. I'm-"

I opened the door and he realised at once that I'd heard him.

"You don't understand, it-"

"Leave. Just leave."

I remembered that he'd told me earlier this evening that he'd left Adam's house almost straight away after Adam's strange behaviour. But he hadn't come home early that night, he'd been gone at least as long as I would usually expect for one of their hangout sessions. I guess now I know where he'd been.

"You're meant to forgive me!" Ben yelled and the prickling, bubbling resentment inside of me overflowed into pure rage.

"Oh, because of the Christian thing that's so fucking inconvenient to you? Is that why? Well maybe God will forgive you but I don't have to. Get the Hell out."

He mumbled something at me as he grabbed his coat but at least he left. I cried and got mad at myself for crying and then got mad at Ben for making me mad at myself. Eventually all of the emotion inside of me burned away and in my new, hollow state all I wanted was to know what had happened. I drove to Adam's place.

Adam didn't answer the door when I knocked on it but there were still lights on in his house. Usually I would respect his privacy but the day had been too overwhelming. I fumbled with my keyring until I found the spare key that he'd given me and clicked his lock open. I needed him to tell me what had happened to him and was now happening to Ben. If it was transmissable, did that mean it would happen to me next? Even though I couldn't off the top of my head think of anything I'd done recently that would have consequences much beyond embarassment I still shuddered at the thought.

Adam wasn't downstairs. I walked upstairs and headed to his room. He didn't appear to be in there either and I was about to conclude that he wasn't home despite all of the lights when the red on the floor of his ensuite caught my eye. I pushed the door open, every rational part of my brain screaming at me not to. I knew he was going to be dead. I knew there was going to be something terrible behind the door.

Adam's body was lying on his back by the sink, his mouth filled with blood. The sink was also a bloody mess with a kitchen knife, a stained flannel and some bulldog clips visible among all of the red. I couldn't piece together the need for stationary supplies in this madness at first. There was a bottle of vodka next to the sink and one of those tiny travel sewing kits you get from hotels. 

*Oh.*

A wave of dizziness forced me to sit down heavily on the side of the bath as I put together what Adam had tried to do and then vomited into the tub. He'd needed the sewing kit because he'd tried to remove his tongue. The chunks in the sink that I suppose I'd assumed were just coagulated liquid were chunks of flesh and the clips were intended to stop the bleeding. I guess they hadn't worked out so well.

I scampered back into the bedroom as soon as I could be reasonably sure that I could stand without fainting and tried to figure out what to do. Do you call the police for a suicide? Sure, right. But it isn't a crime. An ambulance wouldn't make sense either given my friend was already dead. The mirror in Adam's room showed me that there was a thick crimson line along the back of my skirt where I'd sat on a bathtub covered in smeared bloody handprints.

"Why would you do this?" I asked.

Wait, no. Why would he do this? It would have been so painful and so difficult. Why...

I pulled my phone out of my pocket.

"Emergency services, what service do you require?"

"Police. My friend's dead. He killed himself but... I think he's done something bad. Really bad. So bad he'd rather die than have anybody know."

"What location are you currently at?"

"His address is... oh, crap. I don't remember his address. He's at the bottom of the road that St Jude's church is on. It's the house with the blue door."

"Okay, and can you tell-" the voice began but I hung up.

People had been reeling off all of the terrible things they'd done only when they were both out of sight and within hearing range. This wasn't exactly unfamiliar to me and I began to walk up the hill to the church.

The church was empty but open, as I knew it would be. Father Michael had always been a huge proponent for the importance of confession. I walked towards the booth and sat down within it, my tongue reeling off my indescretions without my consent. What would happen if he just sat there behind his screen and I was unable to ask him what he'd done because I was forced instead to endlessly catalogue my sins?

But then it stopped and I was left with an overwhelming desire to redeem myself but there were no more words.

"Why did that- I don't understand why I stopped. Ben and Adam seemed to think there was no stopping that."

"You only have to confess to the sins since your last confession. Then you undergo the necessary penance."

"You haven't told me what that is. You haven't told any of us. How are we meant to know how many Hail Marys we're meant to say or-"

There was a sad laughter.

"Oh, I don't think that's what he'll want this time."

I sat in silence for a moment.

"I think maybe now you need to confess to me, Father. My friend is dead. Tell me what you did."

I wasn't very hopeful that he'd agree to this but he did. Maybe confession truly is an important this.

"If I'm supposed to confess then I suppose I should start by admitting how much I'd started to hate people. I took up this role out of hope and love for humanity but less and less people were turning up to the services. I'd read the newspaper every day and people were out there doing terrible things but they weren't sorry for it. They didn't come here to confess or even worse they *did* come here and just never mentioned the horrible things they were doing outside of these walls. We are supposed to feel sorrow for our sins, to disclose them and then to do something to make amends for them but people weren't."

"They are now. Why?"

"There are books in this church. Not just about God, angels and heaven but other things. Things that I didn't think I'd ever reach out to. But I reached out to gain power to spread a Holy Sacrament. Doesn't that make it worthy? I didn't know that anybody would die. Adam's mother confessed before Adam and she wasn't compelled to die. She just..."

He didn't say any more and I knew that whatever she had been made to do was not as terrible as death but still awful. I don't really believe that Adam reached his penance anyway, I think he only died because he was terrified of a tongue that would betray all of his sins. I wonder what he'd done and how guilty I would feel for not having seen the signs.

"I would say that this is between you and God," I told the priest, "but by your own admission that's not who's judging the rest of us. I suppose you have to confess to your demon, see what penance is given to you for starting this."

I left then and before I'd fully exited the church I heard Father Michael mumble something to whoever had started this chain of confessions.

That was one month ago now. Father Michael died by his own hand which surprised everybody but me. The investigation into Adam after his death uncovered some unsavory details that make me feel sick that I ever saw him as a friend. Ben and I are still broken up but as I was briefly investigated as a person of interest in Adam's death any hope I had in explaining to our mutual friends that our break up was thoroughly his fault is long gone. The wave of confession and penance continues to sweep the town and whilst there have been a few more deaths it's much more common to see someone with a poorly explained injury than to hear that they died.

  
The real problem though is where it ends. I tried telling some people what Father Michael had told me but understandably, no one currently believes me. Unfortunately as hearing someone's confession seems to be all that it takes in order for you yourself to fall prey to the need to admit your sins there have already been cases that have cropped up outside of the town's borders. Hell, since I know that some residents of the town have been on holiday since all of this began it's more than possible that this isn't even confined to the country any more. Which is, I suppose, why I'm typing all this out. One day soon anybody reading this might have to confess their sins. So I guess that's something for you to think about.
