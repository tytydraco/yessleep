I 16(F) had a sleepover with my friends Emma and Jazz. We did all the typical teenage girls sleepover activities, made cookies, got our nails done, and went swimming in my pool. However, at around 11 pm we decided it was around the time of the night to get on Omegle, a staple in any sleepover. We didn’t bother putting any tags since we just wanted to talk to random strangers.

After about 10 minutes of the usual kids, racial and homophobic slurs, dicks, and the occasional pop up ads we finally met a really sweet girl around our age. We talked to her for about 10-15 before she started drifting her eyes and getting really scared. Jazz asked if she was ok and in the reflection of the black tv in the background we could see someone standing in front of her. We decided to stay on since if she was in danger we were probably her best chance of getting help. 

Emma kept her eyes on the tv while we played it off talking to her about random things like school, extracurriculars, and etc. After about 4 minutes Emma sees the guy leave the room and Jazz asks her quietly if she is ok and if she needs help. She begins crying, hyperventilating, and trying to spit out an answer through her loud breath. Shortly after she finally spits out two quivering words, “help me” a man appears in the frame from behind her and glides a fishing knife across her neck. 

Jazz and Emma along with the girl let out a scream mixed with a gurgling sound from the girl chocking on her own blood. I however, was fairly skeptical and thought this may have a been some sort of sick prank. After about 20-40 minutes of getting my friends to calm down enough that they weren’t shaking in fear anymore we decided it was time to go to sleep and try to forget about what we all saw that night. 

Around a month later each one of us revived packages delivered to my house all different sizes but from the same person. I call over Jazz and Emma to open our packages in the living room. Jazz, had the largest  package being nearly half her size seeing she was pretty petite. I had the heaviest package requiring all three of us to carry it inside. Emma had the smallest package and carried it in with ease. We all sit down on my couch in awe by the packages. 

We all open our packages and our awe and excitement slowly drifts to fear and disgust. Inside the packages was filled with body parts. Jazz having thighs, legs, and toeless feet. I had both fingerless arms, a head, and a torso. However the most gruesome package was Emma’s the smallest. Containing the hair, fingers and toes, eyes, and teeth. We called the police they arrived minutes later to investigate the scene where two of them vomited profusely and one simply fainting due to the gruesome scene. 

No one ever found out who did this or where they were shipped from. Never been on omegle since.
