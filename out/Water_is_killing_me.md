My name is Milton, I am 32, 5’9, and weighed 175 lbs. Now I am probably about 100 lbs at time of writing this. Until recently I have had a perfect medical history. The worst health I have ever had was the flu when I was 16. What has happened recently is scaring me. 

I was doing my morning run, got a good sweat on. Pushed myself harder than usual and started sweating real bad. After I got home I felt a subtle burning/stinging pain on my skin. I thought it was just the sweat combined with the heat of my apartment, so I went to take a shower. I stripped down and started up the water. While I waited for the shower to heat up I glanced at the mirror and noticed something odd. There were patchy red streaks coming from my forehead. Lines of raw skin and dead flakes falling from my hairline like vines crawling down a tree. It looked worse than it felt. I decided I would moisturize after my shower. I went to feel the water with my hand and immediately recoiled away. It was extremely hot, like scorching. But this complex did have finicky water temperatures at times so I thought it was just another one of those days. I had to shower so I just decided to suck it up and hop in. As the water hit my body it didn’t roll off and rinse me off, it felt like it was cutting through every inch of me. Thousands of needles pushed in and twisted. I couldn’t take it for another second. I jumped out without even getting any soap on me and dried off. I felt chills up my spine when I wrapped myself in my towel, but what I saw again in the mirror scared me worse. My body was covered in streaks and blots of that patchy dry skin.  

I felt tender and course and just needed to lay down. When I got to my bed I felt clammy and sore like I had a fever. I stayed naked in the towel and made sure I had no water on my body. Every drop felt like acid. The room was hazy, dark, and humid. I tried to get some rest, maybe I was coming down with something. Would explain why the skin was extra sensitive, I thought.

Napping felt impossible, it was taxing and more draining than if I stayed awake. When I opened my eyes, waves of pain came in. My eyes weren’t dry, they were watering. The moisture hurt so bad that I began to cry, which only made it worse, of course. The salty burn wasn’t as bad as the drowning sensation in my eyes. Like when you dive in a public pool with too much chlorine and keep your eyes open. At this point, I was horrified. I squinted my eyes as I stumbled back to the bathroom to the medicine cabinet, I grabbed some ibuprofen to ease the pain. I threw it to the back of my throat trying to take it dry, but I began to cough and choke on it. I needed to down it with something, so I grabbed my bottle of water from my run, and took a swig. 

I immediately threw up. Not just the pill, but everything in my stomach felt like it shot out from my gut to the floor. Drinking felt like pouring boiling sludge down my throat. On my hands and knees I cried as I looked at the bloody stinging puddle dripping from my hands. I needed help. Wiping off the bile chunks I ran to my phone on the bed. Running while barely able to see is hard enough, but exerting any energy made me dizzy and I fell. Hard. I cracked my skull on the corner of the bed frame. My brain felt like it was in a boxing match with my skull and lost. My ears rang and my head felt numb. When I went to feel the gash the pain swept in like a tsunami. The blood on my fingertips and my skull amplified the pain from the canoe in my head more and more. Building and building as I screamed like an air raid siren. It was as if my body became self aware of every liquid inside of it. Under my skin was lava, coursing through my veins and around my bones, in my bones, through my teeth and eyes and bladder. 

In that moment it decided it didn’t want that liquid inside me, it needed all of it out. I wouldn’t have been able to go to the bathroom if I wanted, my body couldn’t get off the floor. The urge to urinate wasn’t even a choice. Before I knew it my genitals felt like they were being peeled from the inside out and scorching my pelvis as urine and blood drained out onto the floor. I wanted to scream and cry but I knew it would make it worse, so I bit my lip and pressed my eyelids shut as the pain continued on. My body was a warzone fighting against itself. I wasn’t even my own body anymore, I was in some body that I hated and it hated me back. I was observing and experiencing something trying to kill me. I was a victim to this flesh suit of horror and all I was doing is wearing it.

I think I passed out shortly after. I don’t know how much time passed but when I woke up, the pain felt muted but definitely present. The body had blood, puss, mucus, and sweat oozing from every pore and orifice. When I decided to lift this body from the floor, it ended its cease fire and lit up every nerve ending with pain. The whole body was one giant cramp and fluid soaking it in gasoline. When it stepped, it felt like weights were tied around each leg. I pushed the body to the phone and dialed 911. Holding the phone was too much for it so the phone was put on speaker and the operator answered. Or at least I think it did. The call timer appeared blurry on the screen as muffled words bounced off of the fluid in the body’s ears. The canals were flooded and overflowing. I went to speak but all that exited the mouth was air and a raspy wheeze. The body couldn’t take it anymore and collapsed to the floor. 

I moved the eyes towards what remained of the wilted thing I called a hand. Red and raw, skin tearing itself down just for new sensitive skin to take its place to be melted away again. The body was nailed to the ground from the weight and pain. It laid its head down and let the eyelids close to keep out any moisture as if it would do any good. 

I woke up again and managed to get the body to sit up, my skin was burning slowly and the fluid resting. I took this time to check my phone, the operator must’ve hung up since the call was not going. If I did even call, I don’t know at this point. I’m seeing shadows and mirages through the sunken holes I once called eyes. The dehydration is simultaneously killing me with the hydration in my body.

I don’t know if it is a bad call to spend possibly my final moments posting this, but I have no hope in getting help at this point. My only hope is that no one else has what I do. If it is contagious or a disease or divine punishment or a sick demonic joke, I don’t know. But I hope this never happens to anyone else.
