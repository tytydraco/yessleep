My car’s clock said it was 2:11 in the morning.  For the middle of the night, the gas station was busier than I thought it would be.

“The fuck are these mamalukes doing?”  

Two men, one in boxers and a robe, the other in jeans and nothing else, were arguing over a gas can by the pump.  The goofball in jeans had a shotgun slung over his shoulder.   

“You have arrived at your destination,” my car’s navigation told me.

“Yeah, no shit.” I said to nobody in particular.  

 I parked in the handicapped spot and killed the engine.  The orange lot light through the moonroof stained the interior with a fuckin’ pumpkin spice filter.  I checked my sides, the blood had soaked through.  Gingerly I put on a hoodie, put my phone in my pocket and left the car.

The automatic doors opened, generic music a step above white noise coated the interior.  The clerk jerkily refilled cigarette racks behind the counter.

“Welcome in!” he said, pausing long enough to scratch his neck.

“Yeah, top of the fuckin’ morning my guy,” I said.

Fuck it, I thought, I had to piss.  I remember getting hit in the kidneys when I was playing football in high school, I pissed blood for two days.  The bathroom was empty, so I helped myself to the handicapped stall.  I unzipped and expected the worst, but my stream was fine.  Strong, and clear, not bragging, just saying.  

I finished, zipped up, and left to wash my hands.  I don’t flush public toilets.  Listen, I’ve worked in restaurants my whole life and cleaned enough shitters that I’ve seen the horrible shit guests do to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and I know the quality of staff tasked with cleaning it.  Something told me tweaker boy up front wasn’t exactly Felix Unger over here.

Pausing in front of the mirror I lifted my hoodie and shirt and took my first long look at my left side.  The incision was about six inches long, vertical, blood weeping through black threads.  I dabbed it with a paper towel, soaking up some of the fresh blood, and felt something hard, just under the skin.  Gritting my teeth, I pressed it, exploring, something about 3 inches, narrow, foreign.  I pressed harder and saw stars from the pain.  Fuck, something was in there.  What the fuck had these dolts done to me?

I look on the other side, same deal with the paper towels, same six inch incision, but this one had a longer, thicker string sticking out, not just stitches.  I gave it a pull and felt something move under my skin, the pain nearly bringing me to my knees.  I caught myself on the sink, very aware to not let any part of my pants touch this floor.  

I spent a few moments catching my breath and the pain subsided.  My mind regained its perfectly honed instincts.  I looked at my face in the mirror, a little stubble, chicks dig that, but I was mostly looking at my skin.  Shouldn’t I be turning yellow or some shit?  Or maybe that was liver disease.  In the white fluorescent light I looked a little pale, but otherwise just as heartbreaking as usual.  

I gingerly felt the skinny object on my left side again.  What the fuck was that?  What the fuck was sticking out on the other side?  Maybe it’s drugs.  I’d heard the kids are into Fentanyl these days, whatever the fuck that is.  My bear trap of a brain kicked into overdrive.

What had the robot lady said I had to do here?

My phone buzzed, a text message.

*$5,000 in Best Buy Gift Cards.  Do not contact the police.”*

Well that’s fucking convenient.

I tried to unlock the message to reply but it still wouldn’t let me.

Fine.  I gave one more look at my sides, washed my hands again, and left the can.  The clerk had transitioned from restocking cigarettes to restocking dip behind the counter.

“Hey buddy, you guys got any gift cards?”

He turned, smiled with a mouth full of empty spaces.  He had the weird leathery look of a guy who recently did time, and lots of it.

“Yes sir!  How many you need?”

“A shitload, can I get 5k on Best Buy?”

His smile wiped away like bugs under a squeegee.

“I ugh, can’t do that much, I’m sorry.  That’s beyond the limit.”

“Well you can, come on, what’s the fuckin’ limit?”

“It’s a 1,000 per card, but…like are you in trouble?  Did someone tell you to do this?”

“No, it’s my fuckin’ wife’s birthday today and I forgot, can you help me out?  Just give me five cards and I’ll hit the bricks.”

“Man, I think you’re getting scammed,” he looked at my waist, “and you’re bleeding sir.”

“Thanks for the update Kitboda, I’m a fuckin’ professional over here, not some dipshit bingo hall broad.  Just do it, I’ll throw 100 on the Cheesecake Factory for your trouble.”

“No, I’d get fired,” he paused, shuffled his feet back and forth, shrugged, then walked to the gift card section.  He took five Best Buy cards and started ringing them up.

“It has to be one at a time, and you have to buy other shit in between or it triggers the system.”

My man, I thought.

“Yeah, get yourself something nice,” I said, “But keep it reasonable over here.”

My money clip contained three things:  My debit card, my drivers license, and my company credit card.  I didn’t have enough on the debit to cover five or six grand or whatever the fuck this was going to cost, but my company card could cover it easy.  And this would be an easy one to  put on the card, tell HR the mob or some shit had stolen my kidneys, and they’d do a chargeback.  Everybody thinks they’re a wiseguy until they fuck with Visa’s money.

He loaded the first card, I tapped the company card.  He rang up a couple packs of USA Golds and I tapped my debit card, and we wordlessly continued, just two dudes doing financial crimes in the middle of the night.

My eyes drifted to the parking lot, in the harsh white light of the pumps I saw three shabby figures on foot.  My stomach dropped.

“Say pal, you wanna hurry the fuck up?  I’m on a schedule.”

“It takes a while.”

Four cards down, he had trouble scanning a case of Faygo. 

“Listen, just ring the last fucking card up my guy.  I gotta fuckin’ go.”

One of the figures caught sight of my car, did the puppy dog head tilt, and the other three followed suit.  They picked up their pace, walking in a motion too smooth to be natural toward the door.

“...tap your card man,” the guy said.

I tapped, did the electric signature gimmick, and snatched the last card from the counter by the time two of the goombas walked in the sliding door.

“Call the cops!” I said

“Now?”

One of the bums saw me, eyes turned red, and they both bolted in my direction, one the outside of the counter, the other inside, brushing the clerk away with a forearm.  I ran for the door on the other side of the counter, only to be met by the original one in the dopey hat blocking my way.  

Fuck.

I turned and ran for the back exit, but feinted to the right and turned left through the chips toward the coffee section.  My trick worked, and got myself some extra time, but not much, one of the fuckers was still on my heels.  I grabbed a full coffee pot and gave it an overhand toss onto the bum’s face.  

Glass and hot coffee smashed against red eyes and a surprisingly smooth face.  The guy didn’t seem to notice.  Shouts at the front of the store.

I turned and ran again, taking the only opening I could find past the thing.  Passing him I felt a jerk on my neck, my head and body stopped but my feet kept going.  The fucking guy had a hold of the hood on my hoodie, and he yanked me down.

“Hands up!” a voice toward the front of the store, the shirtless guy from earlier.  

Mechanical sound of a shotgun pump.

“I said hands fucking up!  Let him go!”

The guy holding me didn’t let him, meaning me, go, opting instead to drag me toward the front door, I grabbed aisle and held on, but the fucker was strong.

A blast, the sound of my struggle disappeared into ringing ears, bits of shit rained down on top of my head.  The bum didn't stop moving, and I wiggled out of the hoodie and scooted my ass away.  

The shirtless guy pumped the shotgun and blasted the bum again, straight to the fucking dome.  But nothing happened.  He just stood there, didn’t even adjust his footing, just fucking stood there holding my hoodie.

The two other bums turned on their heels and jogged toward the shirtless guy.  He pumped the shotgun and fired into the closest one, direct hit to the bum's chest.  Bits of jacket and sweatshirt ripped away, but the bum didn’t stop.  No Shirt fired again, but it didn’t slow him down.

They converged on No Shirt from both sides.  He held the shotgun up in a defensive posture, one of the bums snatched it from his hand and threw it away.  The other bum grabbed his head.  No Shirt punched, his fist connecting, then opening, shaking in pain.  The bum’s hand closed on No Shirt's head and it collapsed like a watermelon at the Gallagher show.

I knew my moment when I saw it and booked, ignoring the pain in my side I sprinted to my car.  I hit the engine start button and was peeling rubber out of the parking lot before the three things had left the store.

My phone rang and the car answered without me.  Same female smiling TikTok bullshit AI voice.

“Follow the navigation screen.  Obey the speed limit.  Do not get pulled over.  You have less than an hour.”

“Eat a dick!”  I began, but the call ended.  

I look at the navigation screen.  It was telling me to get on the interstate and head to the old outlet mall on the opposite side of the valley, about 30 minutes.  I wiggled in the seat trying to get comfy, more aware now that the pain in my side was something poking me from the inside.

“Be careful of the interstate, there was a tumult downtown earlier, and a larger than normal police presence in the city.”

Who the fuck said that?  Man’s voice, or lady’s voice.  Fuckin’ just a voice. Felt more than heard, Dolby fuckin’ surround sound.  In a panic I turned to the backseat, nobody there.

“The fuck said that?” I asked nonchalantly.

“I did,” the voice said again.  “And please stop wiggling, it takes time to build the proper connections.  Thank you for carrying me, my presence will likely cause you no long-term harm.”

“Oh gimme a fuckin’ break,” I said.
