Growing up as a city kid. I had no trouble sleeping next to my bedroom's window. It gives something that air-conditioner can't provide especially with the climate rising every year. 

The need of fresh air has been a commodity in the pacific. 

So when my uncle asked me to spend my Christmas with them. I was already looking forward to breathe that provincial air. 

He brought me to a house that his wife and child are house-sitting. It was your typical upperclass house; complete with a large backyard enamored with various plants and treesâ€”that it almost look like they have their very own jungle, with numerous rooms decorated with local paintings and antiques.  

I spent my Christmas in total awe with how architecturaly and interior-aly magnificent this house was. I can only imagine how big must the family be to buy something large to accommodate their needs. Afterall, the house was only meant for vacations so it's usually my uncle and his family trying to fill an impossible space. 

To give a bit of information about us. We were poor, and my grandmother had been working for this rich family for 30 years that some of my family members got their employment through them. And my uncle, was entrusted to keep their vacation house clean and occupied while they are busy with their lives.  

So not only my visit are allowed but they also know me by name. 

Going back. I spent two days wondering throughout the neighborhood, only to found out the reason why it's so quiet. From our left, live a clergy of priest and to our back live a covenant of nuns and the rest are empty houses. 

They didn't spend their Holidays like we did. While we huddled and celebrate with music, their houses on the other hand are filled with nothing but the sound of crickets. Almost like they were never really there. Except for the constant lights that goes on throughout the night. 

I kept asking my aunt about them but she never really know much about them except that they don't wear their religious uniform. 

I never think much about them afterwards until one night. When I was scrolling through my instagram feed and blaring loud rock music through my headsets. 

I heard a knock

Thinking that it was from the music. I let it go until I heard it again, then again and again till it made me pull off my headsets to hear it clearly. 

I was very much alone. And my uncle and his family sleeps downstairs. So I have no one but a semi-cluttered room with a bunk bed and an electric fan that I barely use. 

I hesitated to put my headset back but I was already scared to acknowledge anything that I slept through the night with my headphones stuck on my head at a max volume. 

The next night was brutal. The knocking become so aggressive that I almost felt my bed shaking from the intensity and the noise is so loud that it's  impossible not to missed it. 

I told my uncle and aunt about this but they shook it off. Telling me that this place isn't haunted.

The next night. I slept in a different room. I didn't care if I didn't get any signal with this one, all I care about is my safety and sanity. But I couldn't sleep, it feels so weird. As if I'm uncomfortable with the bed I'm lying on. 

I made sure that the mattress I used have no bed bugs but the itch is so unbearable that I had to switch cover thrice.

The next few nights, I tried almost every room but every last one of them had the same uncomfortable silence or itchy bed. Despite cleaning it for hours and hours, vacuuming every dust and web I can find. I can't find one place to sleep in. 

The next night. I came back. My headphones ready and cellphone charged to the fullest. I was ready to faced whatever this thing, but it never came. 

There was no knock or weird shaking. The room, for what it used to be, become entirely silent. Almost comfortable to be true. 

I could finally sleep again. 

I was woken up at 3:00 Am. The knocking woke me up, and I found myself with no headphones on and sweat covering my body despite the cold weather. I tried to put it back but the battery must have depleted that I have no other choice but to play it on speaker. 

The knock suddenly stop

The music kept going

I heard a psst from outside the window

And I become completely aware that a shadow had been standing there the whole time. 

A figure of what I can distinguish wearing a sister's veil stands at the edge of my window. 

I didn't dare utter a sound. I was petrified on the spot. I can't even scream for help. 

The figure didn't move for a moment until I noticed there's another one standing behind it.

Without their eyes. I could feel their stares burning at the thin curtain covering what little protection it provided between us. 

I tried to move my legs but it failed me that I slumped on the cold tiled floor. 

Unfortunately, my action had caused a reaction. From the moment I pull myself together. My body went pale when they press their faces on my window, in an attempt to get in. 

I didn't stand long enough to see if they can. I bolted as fast as I could and told my uncle about it. 

The next day, we found chicken heads scattered around the backyard. Some are burried, but most are probably eaten by the dog. 

I didn't see myself staying for New Year despite their persuasion. I went home the next morning and never look back.
