Aunt Gigi led us to her office. She closed the door, locked it, muttered to herself *“damn 343 and its eavesdropping,”* and then took a seat at her desk. “I’m sorry. I should’ve told you everything sooner,” she said, looking at the three of us grimly.

“You think?” I snapped.

I instantly regretted saying that, from the guilty expression on her face. *What’s wrong with you?* I scolded myself. Aunt Gigi could’ve been indirectly responsible for killing us all, but one heartfelt apology and guilty look and I want to forgive her for everything.

“Do I really have to tell your friends, too?” she asked, looking skeptically at Kira and Elias.

“They saw everything, so, yeah. Besides, I’d say you owe me.”

She sighed. “Okay. The thrift shop has been in my husband’s family for generations. I think I’m the first person not related by blood to run it, though. No one expected him to die so young.” She sighed and put her elbows up on the desk. “There was actually a bit of a legal battle, where his uncle wanted to take it from me. But the will clearly left it to me. That was before I knew what it really was, of course… I would’ve gladly given it to his uncle if I knew.” She shook her head.

Kira plopped down on the floor, criss-cross applesauce. Elias leaned against the back wall, looking tall and brooding, like he was thinking deep thoughts. Knowing him, though, he was probably just thinking about the classification of spiders or something.

Aunt Gigi glanced to each of us, one by one, frowning. “So, there are…” she paused for a while, and then went with: “…*people* on this earth that need to buy things that are a little… *different.* Some of the things sold here are dangerous, but it’s better if they’re vetted and regulated. There’s an entire Board for supernatural objects that I have to report to. They tell me which things I’m allowed to sell, and which ones I need to send back to them. Let me see…” She grabbed a book off the bookshelf behind her and thumbed through it. “Here’s one I had to send back to them.

She slid the book towards me.

*Entity #824*

*Class V*

*Presentation: #824 is a pewter fork. It is six inches long, one-twelfth of an inch thick, and three-quarters of an inch wide at its widest point. It has five tines and weighs one-point-eight ounces. It has the imprint of a man’s face on the top of the handle, which has its mouth wide open, as if screaming.*

*Safety Precautions: When #824 is inactive, it is harmless and can be handled using Class I Safety Precautions. #824 is activated when the tines come into contact with any solid or liquid with a water content of over thirty percent. In one case, it was observed to activate in air, when humidity reached eighty-three percent (Patel, et al, 2004).*

*At that time, it is theorized that a poison\* is secreted from the tines. Whoever ingests what the fork touches will become fatally ill. They will experience fever, sweating, dizziness, and hallucinations. They will die within four to seven days, with the average being five-point-seven.*

*Not much is known about the person’s experience after they ingest the poison, as they are usually unable to speak after day two (they only scream.)*

*Recovery Procedures: #824 cannot be destroyed with fire. It can withstand up to 10,000 PSI, or possibly more (O’Keefe, 1997.) There is no known cure for individuals affected. Because of this, it is recommended that #824 is kept locked in a safe at twenty-percent air humidity or lower.*

*Origin: It is thought that #824 dates back to Rome in the 4th century, when they began experimenting with material properties, such as using dichromatic glass in the Lycurgus Cup. However, the entity’s exact origin is unknown.*

*\*While theorized to be a poison, the exact nature of the substance is unclear. It decomposes so quickly, thorough studies have been impossible.*

“I got it from a traveling salesman,” she said. “Well, not literally. He wasn’t a *man,* of course. But the Board said no. Apparently, because it was so untraceable, it had been used in several murders already. They were glad to have it back.”

“So the fork isn’t okay,” Elias said, reading over my shoulder, “but the woman in the painting, who almost killed us, is?”

“It’s complicated. The painting was supposed to be picked up a few days ago. I was only keeping it for a little while.”

“And you let me work here, alone, while you were in possession of it,” I said, glaring at her.

“Look, I’m sorry. I’d forgotten about it. Okay? You were the one who didn’t listen to my rules. About wearing closed-toe shoes and everything,” she said back.

“Fair,” I said. “Sort of. Mom’s going to be *pissed,* though.”

She paled. “You’re… you’re not going to tell your mom about this.”

“I’m not?”

“She’d *kill* me.”

“Oh yes, she absolutely would.”

She glanced at Kira, then Elias, then back at me. Then her eyes narrowed. “You’re trying to negotiate with me. Is that it? You want something? Spit it out, then. You want money? You want me to pay you for the summer, and tell your mom you’re working when you’re out surfing or something? Fine. I’ll do it. But if you *ever* breathe a word—”

“That’s not what I want.” I looked at her squarely. “I want the fork.”

“Nadia, I can’t—”

“Kidding. I want you to employ Kira with me. Her job sucks. Her coworker harasses her. Her boss makes her come in on weekends.” I glanced down at her. “No offense.”

She put up her hands, as if to say, *nope, it’s fine.*

Aunt Gigi’s eyes narrowed, glancing from me to Kira.

“I don’t know,” she said. “What if something in here injures or kills her? I’m going to be sued to all hell.”

My jaw fell open. “*That’s* what you’re worried about?”

“Well, obviously I don’t want her to die, either. I’m just saying…”

“I’ll sign a waiver,” Kira cut in. “I’ll do whatever. You just have to educate us properly on the dangers. Because, like, you didn’t tell Nadia what was going on at all.”

“This is a big ask,” Aunt Gigi said.

I pulled out my phone and started dialing.

“No—okay, okay! She can work here. It’s not my fault if she dies, though. The waiver’s going to say that.”

\*\*\*

The first few days of the job went smoothly. Aunt Gigi gave us everything to read. The manual, the safety protocols, *everything.* “I didn’t think there would be homework,” Kira groaned, as we poured over the manual on our break.

“It’s better than working with Chad, though, isn’t it?”

She sighed. “Yeah.”

An hour after our break, on that third day, we had our first customer. Most of our work up until then had been reading, restocking, and sweeping the floor—we hadn’t dealt with customers yet. Aunt Gigi always dealt with them if she was here, but today she wasn’t, off to pick up some haunted table china in Rockville.

The bell jingled. Kira and I looked at each other, excited, and then made our way to the front of the store.

The safety manual had included a list of rules for how to interface with the “not-people,” as Aunt Gigi so lovingly called them. I felt like they would be supremely offended if they knew we called them not-people, but she said there wasn’t a better word. “They’re other beings wearing peoples’ skin,” she’d said, “so I suppose you could call them that. Skin-wearers, maybe?”

“No,” Kira and I said at the same time.

The rules were simple. Don’t make eye contact with them. Don’t speak to them more than necessary. And don’t *ever* ask them why they need to purchase what they’re purchasing.

This not-person took on the appearance of an older gentleman. He had fluffy white hair and bent dramatically over his cane. He wobbled into the store, slowly scanning our wares, his thick mustache trembling with each breath. Aunt Gigi warned us that sometimes the not-people looked *off—*uncanny—like an early ‘00s render or a drawing of a person by someone who’d never actually seen a person. This man was no exception.

I didn’t make eye contact with him, but I could tell his eyes were too close together. His face was too, trapezoidal almost, with the cheekbones sticking out so far. And his arms weren’t even the same length.

“Excuse me, miss,” he said in a warbly voice as he approached the counter, “could you direct me to the fedora, please? Number two-one-two.”

Wow, this guy (not-guy) didn’t screw around. He gave the number and all.

“Not a problem,” I said, riffling through the manual.

*Entity #212*

*Class III*

*Presentation: Entity #212 is a fedora-style hat in a men’s size 7. There is a small tear on the rim, but it is otherwise in good condition. When worn, it allows Subentity #212-A, colloquially known as “The Demon,” to take control of the wearer’s body. “The Demon” is a bit of a misnomer, as the behavior of #212-A is more poltergeist-like than demon-like, and there is no proof that it is associated with demons from Christian theology.\**

*Safety Precautions: #212 only activates if it is placed on the head a living creature (human or animal.) It will not be activated if it is touched by hands or other body parts.*

*Recovery Procedures: Removing the hat will immediately stop all effects.*

*Origin: Unknown, though the lack of stitchwork indicates this is not an ordinary object that was given these qualities, but a created as a whole through supernatural means.*

*\*More conventionally “demonic” behavior of #212-A has been reported from unverified sources. The Lin Scale classifies #212 as Class IV because of these accounts.*

“Right this way,” I told the man, leading him towards the back, where we kept our clothing items. There was a rack of a few dresses and a coat rack that held exactly one child’s coat and one fedora-style hat.

I carefully took it off the rack, keeping it far away from my head, and gave it to the man. “Here you go! Payment up front.”

I stared walking back towards the counter.

I was halfway there when I felt pressure on the crown of my head.

*What the—*

My entire body froze. I tried to take a step, but couldn’t. My heart began to pound.

He put the hat on me.

I tried to lift my arms to take it off. Nope.

*KIRA!,* I screamed internally. *Where the fuck are you?*

My body started to rotate. I turned towards the man, and felt my lips turn up in a smile. “So we meet again,” I heard my voice say. Except it sounded so unlike me, filled with hate and venom, coming from low in my throat.

I stepped towards the man. He flinched. “Have you thought about the deal?” I rasped.

He nodded.

*No, stop, stop it!*

“I want to proceed,” he said, finally.

“You remember our terms?”

He nodded.

“You will provide me a permanent host, and I will restore your youth?”

He nodded again.

*Permanent host?*

“Is this host sufficient?” he asked. “It is youthful, and female, like you.”

A pause.

“It is sufficient.”

*NO!* I screamed internally. *GET OUT OF MY HEAD!* But no matter how hard I tried to wrench my arms to my head, I couldn’t lift a single finger. My heart pounded in my chest. *FUCK FUCK FUCK. GET OUT! GET OUT!*

Kira would find me. She would take the hat off. And then it would all end. Right?

“There is just one modification I would like to make,” I heard my voice say. Then I wheeled around the room. I picked up an old silver knife, held it up to the light.

Then I brought it closer to my face.

“I had blue eyes in my corporeal form. Not brown,” the voice said.

*Oh no oh no oh no—*

The pressure disappeared. Kira was standing in front of me, holding the hat. “What the *fuck* are you doing?!” she screeched. “You’re not supposed to put this on!”

“He, he put it on me—”

I whipped around just in time to see the man escaping out the front door.

“Oh no,” Kira said, pointing to my eye.

*Oh no.* I touched the skin under my eye. My fingers came away red.

“Is it bad?” I whispered.

“’Tis but a scratch,” Kira replied.

And that’s how Kira and I learned that not every customer of Gigi’s is nice. In fact, sometimes the not-people are more dangerous than the entities themselves.
