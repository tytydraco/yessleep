As I sit here, writing this account of my experiences, I can't help but feel a sense of despair wash over me. For the past year, I've been living a nightmare - a curse that has turned my life upside down. Every night, as the sun sets and the darkness envelops me, I transform into an ogre - a monstrous, grotesque creature with a appetite for destruction and violence.

It all started about a year ago, when I was on my way home from work. I was walking through the park, taking the same route I always did, when I heard a voice behind me.

"Hey, miss. Can you spare some change?"

I turned to see an old, ragged man sitting on a bench, his hand outstretched. I hesitated for a moment, but then rummaged through my purse and pulled out a few coins, which I placed in his palm.

"Thank you, miss," he said with a toothless grin. "May the gods bless you for your kindness."

I nodded and continued on my way, thinking nothing more of the encounter. But little did I know that those words would come back to haunt me.

That night, as I lay in bed, I felt a strange sensation wash over me. My skin began to itch and burn, and I felt a creeping, writhing sensation deep within my body. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just a weird allergy or something, but the feeling only intensified.

Suddenly, with a loud cracking sound, my body began to contort and change. My bones elongated and twisted, my skin thickened and turned green, and my teeth sharpened into jagged fangs. I screamed in agony as the transformation completed, and when I looked in the mirror, I saw the monster staring back at me - an ogre, with bulging muscles and a savage, ferocious face.

For the next few weeks, I was consumed by terror and confusion. Every night, as the sun set, I would transform into the ogre, and every morning, I would wake up in my own bed, my body returned to normal. But the memories of my monstrous actions stayed with me, haunting me day and night.

I tried to tell my friends and family about what was happening, but they just looked at me with concern and told me I was having some sort of breakdown. I went to see doctors and therapists, but they couldn't find anything wrong with me. I was completely alone, with no one to turn to for help.

As the weeks turned into months, I learned to control my transformations to some extent. I started wearing gloves and long sleeves to cover up my ogre-like skin, and I avoided mirrors at all costs. But the curse still held sway over me, and every night, I would be forced to transform into the monster.

I tried to make the best of it, focusing on finding ways to use my ogre strength and powers for good. I started working with a local animal shelter, using my ogre strength to lift heavy crates and move heavy equipment. I also started doing charity work, using my powers to help those in need.

But no matter how much good I tried to do, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was a monster. Every time I transformed, I felt a wave of fear and disgust wash over me. I was constantly worried that I would lose control and hurt someone, or that someone would find out about my secret.

One night, as I was walking home from the animal shelter, I heard a commotion coming from a nearby alley. I followed the sound and found a group of young men attacking a woman, trying to steal her purse. Without hesitation, I charged at the attackers, using my ogre strength to knock them aside and protect the woman. She looked at me with wide, terrified eyes, but I just gave her a reassuring nod and told her to run.

As the woman ran off, the attackers regrouped and came at me with knives and pipes. I fought them off as best I could, using my ogre strength and speed to outmaneuver them. But as the fight went on, I felt a sense of anger and rage growing inside me. The more I fought, the more I lost control, and before I knew it, I had transformed fully into the ogre.

I let out a fierce roar as I charged at the attackers, tearing through them with my bare hands and fangs. I was consumed by a primal instinct to protect and destroy, and I couldn't stop until every one of them was down.

When the fight was over, I stood panting in the alley, surrounded by the bodies of my attackers. I felt a wave of disgust and horror wash over me as I realized what I had done. I had let the curse consume me, and I had become the very monster I had always feared.

I turned and ran, not knowing where I was going or what I was going to do. I just knew that I couldn't stay there, not after what I had done. I ran and ran, until I collapsed in an empty field, far from civilization.

As I lay there, struggling to catch my breath, I knew that I couldn't go on like this. I couldn't keep living in fear and secrecy, always worrying about when and where the curse would strike next. I had to find a way to break the curse, no matter the cost.

And so, I made a decision. I would seek out the old man who had cursed me, and I would find a way to make him reverse it. I didn't know how I would do it, or what it would take, but I was determined to find a way.
