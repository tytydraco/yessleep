I slept through my alarm this morning and was running late for work. I rushed out the door without eating anything and sped to work. There is no street parking by my work so I have to park in a parking garage around the corner everyday, but today almost every level was full. I ended up having to park at the very top and found out that the elevator was broken.

"Great, now im going to be even more late," I thought to myself. I was speed walking down the street looking at the nasty text from my boss when suddenly something hit me in the face causing me to jump back. I quickly looked around to see who threw something at me, but everyone around was walking briskly with their own destinations in mind. At my feet I noticed what hit me, a paper airplane. I picked it up and noticed it was two sheets of paper folded together that were both full of yellow writing. I wanted to read it, but as I was running so late I just shoved it in my pocket and ran the rest of the way to the office. 

When I got to the building I pushed through the revolving door and made my way to the elevator. I got chewed out by my manager for being late and spent the next several hours in meetings and doing paperwork. When I finally found time for lunch I drove to a local deli I like and was halfway through my hoagie when I remembered the airplane. I pulled the two sheets of paper out from my pocket and smoothed them out. I am going to write out the contents of the letter here. 

My name is Tara H and I am being held against my will. I went to a psychiatrist to talk about my depression, but I made a mistake. I told him about the changes I've been noticing. He seemed unconcerned with what I was telling him at first, but then he made a phone call and proceeded to tell me he was involuntary committing me to this Insititution. I was furious and screaming at him, I felt tricked. I wanted to run away but when he opened the door there were two large men waiting to escort me. He said I was a danger to myself and others. That wasn't true was it? 

That was at least two months ago. They won't let me leave. The nurses keep telling me the only way I can leave is once the doctor determines I no longer pose a threat to myself, but he's never even here! The doctor seems to only come in once a week and every time he tells me maybe next week I will be cleared. There are around 15 other patients here with me. Most seem to be in a worse state than me. Some of them are nice. Some of them do nothing but scream or cry. We have no access to a phone and are not able to send out letters. There are visiting hours, but I have never seen a single visitor. Why wouldn't my mom visit me? 

I started to tell myself I was crazy. Maybe this was good for me. If the medical staff is saying I am a danger to myself they must have a reason right? But then I noticed another change. My roommate's half heart tattoo was on her right arm instead of her left. I specifically remember her telling me she had hers on the left and her boyfriend has the other half on his right arm. I thought maybe I was just mistaken and brought it up to her joking about how forgetful I am, but she looked down at her arm and looked scared. She ran out of the room yelling about how her tattoo changed and the men who brought me in came quickly and took her out of the ward. 

That was three days ago and she hasn't returned. I don't know what is going on, but I don't think they will ever let me out of here. I am writing this with a crayon because they won't let us have a pencil for fear we might hurt ourselves. There is a window high up on the wall that the nurses open sometimes when it gets hot. I am going to fold up this letter into a paper airplane and when no one is looking try to throw it out the window. Please if you are reading this please ask my mom to come get-

Suddenly my phone rang ripping my attention from the letter. It was my boss calling furious I was late to work and now late to come back from lunch. After a slew of apologies I ran out the deli and drove back to the office. Thankfully I found a spot on the street to park by the office and quickly ran up to the building. The doorman held open one of the double doors for me and after thanking him I got in the elevator. My boss chewed me out for a good half hour, but now I'm back at my desk. I should be doing work but I cant stop thinking about the letter. I looked up mental institutions nearby, but there are none for miles. Is this just a silly prank? Did some kid throw the airplane at me and then hide before I could see them? I don't know but I just can't stop thinking about it so I am posting this online for others to see. The story about the tattoo just seems so outlandish. Things like that can't change, right?
