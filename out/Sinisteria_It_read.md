My boyfriend is typing this for me. I want to preface this by saying I am on meds for my delusions and have been since I was twelve when I was diagnosed with schizophrenia , I also want so say that  I am not one to believe in the paranormal, but this story has made me check my medicine bottle's label and go to church quite a few times, so when I say this scared me, no, scarred me, I am not kidding.

It all started with a note left on one of my leaf tailed geckos, Holly's, tank. It Just stated, "capsize thy holly" I just wrote it off as my boyfriend pranking me, then I just ripped it apart and threw it away. Then, what I could only assume to be God themself, told me "good." I do not know how it happened I wan just overcome with orgasmic euphoric sensation, then I just sensed 'good' I cannot tell how or where but I knew one thing, "good." I immediately took more medicine and called it a day. I went to sleep that night hugging my boyfriend a bit tighter that night.

Then I had this horrific dream, where the entity which told me good earlier started screaming, "CAPSIZE THY HOLLY" while shoving Holly's upside down, limp, dead body in my face. I woke up and ran to Holly's tank and she was safe and healthy. what I did not notice was the fact that my boyfriend was gone, and that there was a note on my head "follow me, you know where" as I put Holly away to go find my boyfriend. There was a note, "The First Letters That God SPEAKS To YOU, YOU Must Decipher" Me being atheist, or now agnostic thought that my boyfriend was really messing with me, but I thought it could lead me to his current location. Maybe it was a surprise date, or better, a proposal. So I sat down thinking about what the entity said to me, Good, Capsize Thy Holly, One part of me thought that it was saying that it would be good to capsize or kill Holly, but I  read the note more carefully as it states, "The First Letters That God Speaks To YOU" So I deciphered further, "GCTH" I knew exactly what it meant. GC meant group chat and TH meant The Herps. Coincidentally, I am in a groupchat called The Herps.

I frantically opened my phone to the group chat and noticed a new phone number posting a location saying "lets meet up!" Then as soon as I read the text another message from the same number appeared, "Sinisteria" it read. I started to call the number but it picked up before I could even hit the last dial, it said, "Sinister Hysteria, Sinisteria! quite a fun little word I made up for our little situation" I froze, it was the same voice, well not quite a voice more of an energy of dread, of the god like entity earlier. I called 911 to get myself into a pysch ward, it picked up the phone on the cops end, "Look on the back of the notes there is an photo, and if the photo meets the  location of the capture, it will all make sense, they go find your little boyfriend, you know where", during this time I realized I was have an out of body experienceI was floating out of my body and I could see my whole room from a birds eye viewpoint, I could see the ripped up note in the  trash and the other note still on Holly's enclosure, I also saw a strange shape in my closet. 

I pieced the tore up note together from the backside but the "photo", did't make any sense, I combined it with the other note and it formed a cohesive thing, the same thing that was in my closet, but it didn't make sense, yet...

I grabbed Holly as a ran out our apartment and to the location the mysterious phone number texted the croup chat, then I texted the rest of the group chat about the new person and who they were, they acted like I was crazy, my boyfriend texted me "please come home, I am waiting!" I didn't believe them, I continued on.

I saw my boyfriend standing my a sewer with a camera, shaking. All of a sudden he took a picture, the flash "echoed" though the tunnel with light. The light illuminated a monster, the same monster that was in my closet, the same one in the picture, with the same energy as the calls and voices. 

I understood now, that my boyfriend had written the notes warning me of it, when I tore up the first one the entity, it said good. It wanted me and Holly dead, I knew from the moment I saw it. I cannot describe what I saw in human words, I saw new colors, I saw in the infinity-ith demention. It was figuratively hell, as soon as a saw it I clawed my eyes out. I wanted to kill myself, Holly was screaming and I knew I had to put an end to her suffering, so I killed her in an unspeakable way. Then the entity ran at me shoving Holly's carcass in my face, the "dream" was not a dream, not a premonition, it was a memory, but I passed out as my boyfriend fought the entity screaming, "I need help!"

There was a note, "help me this time" I ran to my closet where the monster should be and this whole time loop made sense, I cannot describe it, it just felt right. But as I felt happy, I was filled with dread as the phone rang, it said, "FEAR" And nothing made any sense I looked and the monster was gone, I mumbled one word before passing out again, "sinisteria"
