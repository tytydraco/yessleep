Hi, I’m a first time poster, in fact I’ve never used Reddit until the guy I’m talking to recommended I share my story on here. My name is Carla, and I was a teen mom. I’m twenty five now and my son is 8 years old, his name is Milo. He went missing a few days ago, I’ve already talked to the police and amber alerts have gone out. I’ve done everything in my power to find him so I’m turning to you guys to hopefully spread the word and find my son.  
 Now I’ve recently begun renting a house in the suburbs. It’s a place still in development so there is a lot of wild grass, forest, and general wild life right in our backyard. It’s a small place though, one of those one floor places with a single garage. Now I’ve not had any problems with sleeping but Milo has. He’s been waking up almost every night at various times, sometimes he’ll get into my bed without uttering a word; and other times he’ll utter a few words. One night he muttered something that unsettled me. As he stood in my doorway he said “Mommy, there’s little people in my room.” I was drowsy at the time so I didn’t think too much about it. It was only in the morning when I asked him what he had said that night that I really took it in.  
 As soon as he said that I walked over to his room, opened the door and was met with nothing out of the ordinary. I walked in and looked around, my eyes scanning the bottom of the walls. ‘Maybe he saw a mouse’ I thought to myself. Then I saw it, a hole in the wall. I turned around to see Milo staring at me from the doorway. “Is this where the little man came from dear?” I asked.  
 “Yes…” He said in a meek and somewhat scared tone.  
 “Was what you saw a mouse dear?” I asked, chuckling a little. This place was cheap so I figured we’d have some kind of rodent problem.  
 “No, it was a little man!” He exclaimed whilst stomping his foot into the wooden floor.  
 “I’m sure it wasn’t a little man.” I responded, picking him up and holding him. He was heavy and I couldn’t hold him like I used to. “You’re the only little man I can see!” I said, smiling at him. “You can sleep in my bed for a few nights though, okay?” He nodded his head, and as I held him in my arms he was shaking ever so slightly.  
 The next morning the kitchen was a mess, and Milo wasn’t in my bed. I finally found him beneath the sink cabinet and he just kept saying; “I tried to stop them mommy!”, but no matter how much he apologized I was still upset. Why would he do this? The kitchen was a mess, dishes were broken and silverware was strewn everywhere.  
 Things only got worse as the nights went on, and I still didn’t believe him until he came to me during the day with a shoe in his hand. “Look mommy! I told you! Look!” And as he rolled his shoe over it revealed the dark red spot and broken bones of his little man. My face looked at it in horror.   
 “Okay honey… okay we’re going to sleep in my bedroom tonight okay?” I told him as I picked him up. That night I called my mother telling her the situation and she told me that me and Milo could sleep there until we get an exterminator out there.  
 That night though I awoke to Milo missing and the house a disaster. Red spots and little bodies littered the house, and it seemed like Milo didn’t leave without a fight.   
 I’m at my mothers house now and I’ve told the police everything, though they said they don’t see any ‘small bodies and red spots’ inside of my house, just the disaster that clearly took place when Milo was taken. If any of you know what I could do to get my baby back I’d be forever in your debt, please just help me get him back!
