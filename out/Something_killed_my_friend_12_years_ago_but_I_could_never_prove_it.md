This is not a haunted house story.

The events that I am about to explain are all real. I have not edited, fabricated, or otherwise taken creative license with this story.

My grandfather was a painter. He lived in a barn near a small town outside Albany, NY.  He was unusual: blunt, stubborn, and reclusive, but blindingly smart, to the point that he was difficult to talk to. I didn’t get to know him as well as I would have liked by the time I was fifteen, when he died of a heart attack. The event itself was sad but expected. He had long since refused to leave that house for a nursing home, which would have saved his life. I guess that’s understandable.

After graduating from a decently prestigious college with a Computer Science degree that proved much less useful than I had initially hoped, I floundered in the city, looking for a job, but quickly wasn’t able to pay the rent. My parents, who were off traveling in retirement, let me stay in grandpa's old house until I could get back on my feet.

People make the mistake of thinking that the country is quiet. It isn’t. The sound of cars rumbling, drugged-out arguments from passers-by, and homeless screaming at the top of their lungs. None of that compared to one night with the trees creaking, leaves crackling, and the various wails and creaks that a house produces uninhibited by background noise. Not to mention, there’s nothing to prepare a city-boy for the sheer darkness of nightfall without light pollution.

I learned this early on, after driving back from town without realizing my phone had died. I stepped out of my car and was shocked that I couldn’t see my hands in front of my face. It was as close to blindness as I’d ever experienced in my life. I was able to stumble my way face-first into the front door, and from then on, I carried a flashlight everywhere I went.

But I got used to it, got a job at a startup in town. My coworkers were nice, but awkward. Talking to them was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole – something just never clicked. Still, it was better than I expected, and my life soon faded into a boring but comfortable routine.

It was around a year into the job that I got a call from John.

John and I had been very close friends in college, but neither of us was particularly punctual when it came to communication, so we ended up drifting apart.

I had been getting this recurring dream about him before the call. It started with a memory: we were on the roof of our dorms, and he was smoking a cigarette. The wind pelted us from the front, blasting in my ears and pushing his long hair over his face. His eyes were squinted and red, as if he’d rubbed them viciously just moments before, and he stared out into the city, not looking at me.

At last, he opened his mouth to speak, but his voice was muted, as if underwater, and easily suffocated by the wind. For whatever reason, this sound overtook me with fear. Skin writhing, I leaned in to catch what he was saying, but he just clenched his jaw and turned away.

“What?” I yelled, my stomach churning.

The wind bellowed, spiraling particles of dust and detritus into my face. White noise overtook my vision, and his now-blurry silhouette took a step backward, the thin remains of his figure disappearing in the storm as he neared what I was certain to be the edge of the building.

Sometimes it felt like he jumped, sometimes it didn’t. Either way, I would wake up in cold sweats.

The call was a relief.

“Hey,” I remember him starting. His tone was flat and low, and lethargic.

“Hey man, what’s up?” I said.

He paused for a long time. “I just got out of the hospital,” he said, slowly, as if every word was a battle just to get out. “Sarah told me you had a place to stay.”

“My parents don’t care… I don’t have anyone else except you to call,” he added.

“Um. Sure, you can stay at my place.” I said, without thinking. “Where are you right now?”

“Louisiana,” he said.

“You got money for a plane ticket?” I said

The line went quiet for a minute. “Yeah,” he said,

I picked him up at the airport the night after that. He didn’t say much in the car, just stared out the window as the surroundings neared closer to total blackness.

He was frailer than when I last saw him, his already angular face gaunt and sharp. He had that Robert Pattinson style messy hair, and it looked like he hadn’t showered in a while. Even though it was thirty degrees out, all he had on was a Death Grips T-shirt and cargo pants.

I put on Spotify and zoned out, trees blurring as I traversed the backroads, high beams misting out on the road in front of me, barely scratching the surface of the rapid onset darkness encroaching my view.

And then a figure jumped out in front of me.

I slammed the brakes, skidding, the wheels slumping over something with a soft lurch. I froze, hands hovering over the wheel, blood pounding in my ears. It wasn’t it person, couldn’t be. Who the hell was out here at this time of night? Nobody. John had shot up and was staring at me with that intense look of his, eyes wide but brow clenched, looking angry even though he was just concerned.

“Shit,” I breathed.

Closing my eyes, I dragged the clutch to park and creaked the door open, cold air breathing in. It was a deer.

I sighed, tension dissipating. John shuffled out of the car, that same ultra-serious expression on his face. A flash of annoyance shot through me. It was fine, I hadn’t hurt anybody: he didn’t have to pretend he’d just witnessed an atrocity. But that was who he was. Whatever.

“Did you see that?” he said,

I tilted my head. “No, John. That’s why I hit it.”

He shook his head, face pale. “Not the deer,” he said, “ the thing that pushed it into the road.”

“What? “I said,

“It was fast and big,” he said, “Probably a bear. They wake up from hibernation in the spring.”

“Let’s get the hell out of here, then,” I joked, looking around. I’d been there two years and I hadn’t seen a bear yet. He was already looking out in the distance again.

I called the police and told them I’d hit a deer on the road and where it was. We made it home at around ten o’clock.

The wind pelted us as we left the car, rocking the trees and spraying freezing air over our ill-prepared bodies. It was a cold day for March. In the dark, he untied his boots and dropped them by the door, and I tossed my parka on the rack. I had bought a boat-load of weed in preparation. We used to smoke constantly together. Wasn’t sure if he was down for it tonight.

All he had was a single duffel bag full of stuff. Enough clothes to last a week in warmer weather, some essential toiletries, and a copy of “The Conspiracy Against the Human Race” by Thomas Ligotti: his favorite book. I had tried to read it once, but it was too nihilistic for me. He claimed to read portions of it every night before bed, but to tell you the truth, I wasn’t sure he’d read more than a Sparknotes summary online. Other than that, he hadn’t even brought toothpaste. I let him borrow mine and told him that tomorrow we were going to head down into town and buy him a winter jacket. Expensive, but he’d just got out of the hospital, and I had the money.

We ended up smoking the weed and watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre. He presented it like it was some artistic horror masterpiece, but the whole thing was so cheesy it felt surreal, which I guess was the point. Either way, we were laughing our asses off within minutes, and it was like old times again.

I had a million questions in the back of my mind, like what the deal was with his parents, and why he'd been at the hospital in the first place, but I didn’t ask any of them. Secretly, a part of me just wanted to push it under the rug for now. The two years before John came were the loneliest years of my life. As far as social interaction went, I invited some of my work “friends” over, once or twice, but it always felt more like a chore. I was happy he’d come, despite the circumstances, and I didn’t want to ruin it, not yet, anyway.

There were plenty of rooms. He chose the one on the other side of the hall from mine. It had been my grandmothers, before she died. The walls were chock full of her paintings: light, flowery, scenes of women in elegant clothing in fields of beautiful roses. My grandfathers were the opposite: erratic and chaotic, with stark colors, painted as if in a frenzy, desperately scraping the canvas. He mostly painted scenes from the Vietnam War, with elements of religion – a devout Orthodox, but even the religious parts were never entirely pleasant. A man, getting riddled with bullets, his friends diving for cover, but nevertheless bathed in holy light, an angel standing over him, skin soft and pale, hand on his shoulder. This was the religion of the Old Testament, tinged with the barbarity of a time before civilization.

I had taken most of his paintings and put them in the basement. They gave me the creeps.

We went upstairs, blazed after the movie, and retreated to our respective rooms. I stumbled into bed, a little nauseous, the world reeling, but relaxed, and stared out into the black abyss that was my roof, and imagined it could almost be the sky – an obsidian, starless sky at the furthest reaches of the galaxy. As I dozed off, it felt like I was floating.

My eyes shot open. It was still dark: the alarm clock read 4:00 am, two hours after I had gone to sleep. The room was still blanketed in a veil of black, but a thin stream of ambient moonlight filtered in, illuminating incomprehensible shapes in the darkness. I tried to turn onto my side, but I was stuck, like I was being pressed down. I opened my mouth in a silent shout, but no sound came out.

The shadows around me writhed, imbued with unearthly life by an unseen force, their forms blurring, shifting into one another. My eyes darted from corner to corner, the only part of my body that could move, until it finally settled on something by the side of my bed, an outline that seemed more solid than the rest, darker if possible. Even the moonlight couldn’t break through it, like some kind of miniature black hole had appeared in my room

The spot was strange. It was hardly perceptible, and only in the frightened half-asleep state I was in would I have ever really noticed it, but it bothered me. It bothered me that I couldn’t understand what it was. I could piece together the other shapes either from memory or by looking long enough, but this was different. There was something… unnatural about it. It shifted in my vision, edges never staying exactly the same. A low sound licked the bottom of my ears, a garbled voice, coming from somewhere in the room that I couldn’t place. Like it too was obscured in the night.

As I slipped back into unconsciousness, two things faded to startling clarity, puzzle pieces fitting in their rightful place. The first, two white dots, dim but unmistakable, hovering within the black. For some reason, I couldn’t see them before.

They looked like eyes.

Just before sleep, the words finally pierced whatever obstruction blocked me from understanding. The voice that spoke them, its tone inhuman, as if whispered by a man at the brink of terminal dehydration, sent goosebumps slithering up my skin.
