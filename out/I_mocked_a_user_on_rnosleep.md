I’ve been reading in this sub for years, usually just before bed as a benign exercise in retaliation. I’m a sucker for metafiction - the blend of realism and unfettered narcissism binds you in a spell that doesn’t require good writing to work. Just POV descriptions and an eerie concept.

But as soon as the spell broke, I was the guy that jumped to the comments to poke holes and give unsolicited advice. Partly to ruin the fun, but more so to feel less immersed and more relaxed.

*“You could have just made a run for it when the murderer was in your friend’s room.”*

*“What kind of idiot opens the door for a food delivery they never ordered when they were being chased by a shapeshifter TWO FUCKING DAYS ago?”*

*“I would have hired plumbers, electricians, or called the cops to feed the heart-munching djinn in the basement. Why go straight to sacrificing your own mom? I swear, wish fulfillment is wasted on the morons.”*

Last week, I saw a post that felt especially off. The pacing was sloppy and the plot itself was so outlandish that I had to stop midway.

I commented: “This story makes no sense. There was a slender man figure, a tarantula-baby, and an alien? Writing was way too inconsistent. Cramming monsters doesn’t make the plot better, it just makes the readers feel like you’re pulling things out of your ass as you go. I can’t even pretend this is real.”

They replied almost instantly. “Can you show me a better horror story, then?”

I grinned at the retort, knowing I'd gotten under their skin, “I’m not going to write a whole story to prove a point. It doesn’t take a writer to spot bad writing.”

Again, the reply was instant. *Too* instant – almost as if they pressed send as I finished typing.

“I said *show* me.”

The reply caught me off guard, but I wasn’t going to let them know that. “If this is your way of trying to keep your story immersive, just stop. It’s getting sad.”

I downvoted the guy to oblivion and soon forgot about the whole thing. I played some games with some friends, ordered fast food, and fell asleep watching a documentary about a college basketball team that beat a group of pros in a scrimmage. Yet another unrealistic story, I thought.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, I opened my eyes to an unfamiliar ceiling, inhaling an air that made me sick to my stomach on a crooked bed. My elbows dug into the mattress as I tried to sit upright, and I felt something damp and squishy make contact from underneath.

Wooden walls. Dusty carpet. One window, one door. And a computer atop a table in the corner.

It was already on. Black screen, with a line of text that became more visible as I walked closer. I sat cautiously on a rusted metal chair inserted on the wooden table.

**“Welcome to your story.”**

I thought it was a dream. Some kind of lucid thing. I opened the door into the hallway. Everything creaked but it didn’t sound authentic – like I was in some kind of movie set. I swear I could even hear a little bit of eerie music being played from *somewhere.*

The door opened to a living room, and that’s when I saw the first *creep*.

Something hunched, but clearly tall. Nine, maybe ten feet. Its limbs – four, five, six, if I counted correctly - were sleek and black. I took a glance at its elongated head and realized why it was hunched. If that thing ever stood upright, its horned forehead would have hit the plaster ceiling.

Goop drooped slowly from holes in its skin, but the viscosity of the liquid did nothing to slow it down. Its movements were blurry – even pixelated – and my mind had a hard time recognizing it was real. I took two steps towards the door opposite the room, hoping it would lead to some normalcy. I heard a quick *sloosh.* It was in front of me in an instant, slamming me against the wall just beside the room I came from. My head throbbed with intense pain and the back of my eyeballs felt tighter as if they were slammed further into their sockets.

 *This is definitely real.* I mustered all my strength, ignoring the pain radiating from my body and the numbing darkness closing in from the corners of my vision. From what I could tell, the thing didn’t bother to follow as I collapsed back in the room.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I woke up again—in the bedroom. Same walls. Same chair. Same screen.

Only this time, a new message had appeared:

**“You seem to be struggling. Why don’t I give** ***you*** **some advice? When you open the door to an alien-like monster, maybe don’t run to the further exit. I would also refrain from doing much of anything until daylight – monster time and all, y’know?”**

I felt sick, taunted. What was doing this to me? The obvious answer was the dude whose story I commented on, but what kind of psycho would actually create a whole horror story set just to play with me? A demon? Some kind of god? I tried typing in the computer, but no words would pop on the screen.

I checked the window on the opposite side of the door. I needed to see where I was.

Outside: woods. Thick trees. No path. Fog curling around the base of the trunks. And in the distance—something standing between two trees. Human-shaped. Still. Watching. I dropped to the floor and closed the curtain.

The screen behind me beeped. Another message had appeared.

**“It should go without saying, but your ape brain seems to be considering it: don’t go into the woods.”**

I didn’t sleep. I just sat there, staring at the screen, waiting for the next instruction. I could still hear the thing in the living room moving, but its footsteps were not consistent. They would stop at one corner and in the next moment would creak on the opposite. Eventually, after what felt like hours, another message blinked into view:

**“Tired of trying things? Why don’t you barricade the door and sleep?”**

*That’s it?* I hesitated, but my body was already shutting down. I dragged the chair and placed it against the knob. I curled up on the bed and let the exhaustion take over.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I opened my eyes again, daylight was pouring through the cracks in the curtain. The house felt… lighter.

I opened the door again. The hallway was clear, no tracks, scratches or weird alien goop.

I moved cautiously into the living room. No monster. Just dust and silence. On the table, three water bottles sat untouched. No note. No clues. No sign of anyone.

I drank two immediately, feeling like I hadn’t had water in days.

Since then, the *tips* have come sporadically. Always via the computer.

**“You should look for a water source before weapons.”**  
**“There’s obviously someone in the bathroom. Wait until they leave – it’s not only cautious but also respectful.”**

I don’t know who’s sending them. But they’re the only thing keeping me alive.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just now, the computer beeped again. I ran to check it.

**“That’s quite enough from me. Why don’t we see how helpful your kind can be?”**

It looked exactly like a Reddit post submission. The sub was already filled in:

r/nosleep**.**

And a box waited. Just text, blinking. I clicked on all the other buttons, the URL, the fucking minimize icon. Nothing. All I could interact with was the textbox.

I tried asking for help, but my posts keep getting removed for violating some guideline. *Must be 500 words or more. Identifying information must be censored. Unacceptable horror.*

God, I hope this one is “scary enough”.

So here I am. Telling my story in a way I hope it won’t get flagged. Hoping someone, anyone, reads it. If you can get me out, offer any sort of information, or have any advice, please say something. I’ll update you if I can.
