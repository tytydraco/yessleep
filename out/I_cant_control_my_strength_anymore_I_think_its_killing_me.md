Look, I know how this sounds. I know.
 
I’ve seen the headlines. I’ve read the horror stories. But this isn’t that. This isn’t some government experiment gone wrong, some cursed object, some cosmic punishment for my hubris.
 
It was just a pill.
 
One pill.
 
I wasn’t trying to become Superman. I wasn’t looking for anything crazy—just a little edge. A **boost**. Something to tip the scales in my favor for once.
 
I’ve always been weak. Not sickly, not fragile, just… **less**. The kind of guy who gets nudged in a crowded bar and spills his drink. The guy who gets the short end of the stick in pickup games, in work politics, in life.
 
And it was fine. I’d accepted it. Until I didn’t.
 
I found the supplement late one night, scrolling on my phone after another long day of being **overlooked**. An ad buried in some fitness forum:
 
**"UNLOCK YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL. SCIENCE-BACKED. SAFE. NO SIDE EFFECTS."**
 
A pill that removes the brain’s natural strength limiters. The theory made sense—our bodies can do **so much more**, but our minds hold us back for safety. This just… **removed the brakes**.
 
And I was desperate.
 
So I took one.
 
At first, nothing happens. I go to work, sit at my desk, and cycle through my usual routine—emails, meetings, coffee breaks that blur together.
 
Then, around noon, I feel it.
 
It starts as a hum under my skin. A lightness. Like the world has tilted **just a little** in my favor.
 
I push back my chair to stand up—
 
And it **slides**.
 
Not a normal scoot. Not a gentle adjustment. It **launches**, metal legs scraping against the floor, catching on a coworker’s bag and tipping over. The whole office turns to look.
 
I laugh it off. *“Guess I’m stronger than I thought,”* I say.
 
But inside? My hands are **shaking**. I was scared of myself.

At the end of the day I go to close my laptop, the hinges **snap like twigs**.
 
My boss watches in stunned silence as I hold the two halves of my company-issued laptop, my fingers white-knuckled around the broken edges.

I tried to shake it off, but the feeling sticks with me. It’s not just the chair—it’s everything.
 
My coffee mug feels **too light** in my hand. When I go to type, my fingers hammer the keys, each stroke heavier than I intend. I try to ease up, but my control feels off, like I’m adjusting to a new body. The letters on my screen are jumbled—nonsense.
 
I backspace. I try again. **More gibberish.**
 
By lunch, my appetite is ravenous. I don’t just eat—I **consume**. My coworkers stare as I finish my meal and move on to the snacks in my drawer. My stomach stretches tight, but I **need more**.
 
The world outside feels sharper, clearer. I take a walk, stretching my legs, feeling a strength I’ve never had before. I test it—pressing against a lamppost, giving it a casual shove. It **groans** under my hand. The metal **warps**.
 
I yank my hand back. My breath comes fast. I walk away before anyone notices.
 
This is good, I tell myself. This is **what I wanted**.

I haven’t slept well tonight. I was grinding my teeth, a habit I’ve had since I was a kid, but this time—it was different.
 
A **snap** woke me up.
 
I felt a huge pain shoot through my jaw. I tasted blood. I sat up, and ran my tongue along my teeth, completely frozen on the spot, telling myself that this did not just happen.
 
**Something’s wrong.**
 
Three molars—**all broken in half**. Jagged edges scrape my tongue. My jaw aches, throbbing deep in my mandible.
 
I swallowed hard, a little too hard. But I think I’m fine. It’s **fine**. Just a fluke. Just stress.

I don’t know what this is doing to me but I am conflicted, I don’t know whether this is a blessing or a curse - but I will keep all of you updated.
