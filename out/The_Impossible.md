In 2012, I was working as the lead diagnostics technician at an automotive shop in California. It was a typical day, and my shift started at 7 AM sharp. I parked across the street and walked into the shop to greet my boss when my phone rang. The call brought devastating news: my grandfather had just passed away in the hospital. Overwhelmed, I quickly said hi and bye to my boss and headed straight home.

Days earlier, strange events began unfolding. It was a Saturday, and my dad and I were working at our house. Throughout the day, peculiar things happened. One incident involved a garage light that repeatedly turned itself on, even after we made certain it was switched off. We would leave the garage only to return and find the light inexplicably lit again.

Later that same day, my dad received mysterious text messages from an unknown number with a 209 area code. The message urgently read, "Mi jefe está muy malo. You need to come now." Alarmed, we quickly packed up and headed to pick up my sister, and then all drove together to Manteca in my parents' Honda Civic. During the drive, my dad received additional messages, including one that asked, "Are you getting my messages?" My dad replied, "Yes." Upon our arrival, we discovered that none of my uncles had sent those texts, and none had recently changed their phone numbers. Days later at the hospital, my sister went through my dad’s phone to find the conversation had inexplicably vanished. My dad never deleted messages.

After my grandfather’s passing, my family gathered at my grandmother’s house, where the atmosphere was heavy with grief. Hours later, my dad suggested we head back home to prepare a room for my grandma to stay with us. Agreeing, my sister, my girlfriend at the time, and I got into my sister’s 2012 Honda Civic. My sister drove, I sat in the front passenger seat, and my girlfriend sat behind my sister. My parents followed closely behind in their own Civic.

As we drove down a quiet street, I noticed a rosary hanging from my sister's rearview mirror, knotted tightly. I casually asked her, "Why do you tie the rosary in such a tight knot?"

She responded, "I don’t like it dangling too low when I drive."

Not thinking much of it, I returned to scrolling through my phone.

We approached a red light, preparing to turn left onto the freeway. Suddenly, my sister screamed. I barely had time to look up from my phone before blinding headlights filled my vision. An oncoming Volkswagen, traveling at nearly 60 mph, swerved into our lane, barreling head-on toward our stationary car.

The impact was immediate and fierce. My parents, who witnessed everything from behind, later recounted how the collision was so intense it lifted our car's rear wheels off the ground and threw us completely out of our lane. Inside the car, everything turned smoky, and my ears rang painfully. A giant check engine light blinked furiously on the dashboard.

In the stunned silence following the crash, I opened my eyes and saw three rosary beads resting in my lap. My heart sank. I thought to myself, "Oh no, Stephanie’s rosary broke."

My memory at this point becomes hazy, but I distinctly recall a woman dressed entirely in white scrubs, like a nurse, opening my passenger door and calmly instructing us to move quickly to safety across the street. According to my parents, however, there was no woman in white—we simply walked across the street on our own.

Shaken and injured, my family frantically checked each other for injuries. I had a fractured sternum, my sister suffered two broken heels, and my girlfriend had internal bruising. Despite the severity of the crash, we had survived.

As we stood waiting for the ambulance, my mother’s eyes narrowed curiously as she pointed to my back pocket. "What's that sticking out of your pocket?" she asked, puzzled.

Confused, I reached behind me, feeling something solid. Carefully, I pulled it out. My heart skipped a beat.

In my hand was my sister’s rosary—completely intact. The very same rosary I'd seen tied tightly to the rearview mirror, the same one I thought had shattered moments earlier. Somehow, impossibly, it had ended up safely tucked into my back pocket.

To this day, none of us can explain how it happened, nor did we ever see the woman in white again. But deep down, I believe someone—or something—was watching over us that day.
