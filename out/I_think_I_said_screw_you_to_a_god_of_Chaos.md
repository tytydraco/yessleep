What is chaos? Is it an idea? In English we define it as an idea: a lack of order, a state of confusion, unpredictability. 

Some think it’s something tangible. If we can account for every single factor using science, math, our own senses, and all that, we could explain all the chaos in the universe. We just aren’t at the right level of development to fathom it. Personally I disagree with this philosophy. It’s true, math and science can explain how a thing happened. They might even be able to explain why. But in the end, its still chaos. We humans will never have the capacity to understand it all, so to us it will always be chaos.

Just as a random example, let’s talk about my sister. She’s paralyzed from the waist down. She wanted to be a dancer. She’d been accepted into a prestigious arts college. Then she went out jogging, stepped around a pile of snow at just the right time, that a motorist, who wasn’t even speeding, hit a small patch of black ice, causing his car to lurch at just the right angle, that the very back corner hit her, and she broke her back hitting the guardrail nearby. A tragic accident that could happen to anyone. 

You know what’s funny? I dug even further. I was angry at the motorist. I’m not sure if I planned to do anything. Honestly I’m not sure what I wanted at the time. But I followed him. I heard him lamenting to friends. He said he didn’t even like going that way. He’d only gone that way after seeing a possum dart across the road, which caused the driver in front of him to screech to a halt, which aggravated him, and made him want to take the turn, and the snow from the night before had been shoveled into a pile at just the right spot that he didn’t think he needed to slow down. So who’s fault was it that my sister’s dreams were dashed? Was it hers for stepping around a snow pile while jogging? Was it the motorist for not going even slower? Was it the possum for running onto a road like a dumb animal?

It wasn’t anyone’s fault really. Legally, it was the motorist’s fault. You should ALWAYS drive carefully with pedestrians in mind. That’s what the law says in most places, and I don’t disagree. But I know more than half the people reading this just scoffed at the idea. Why should YOU slow down? You’re a careful driver. You’ll be able to react in time. It will all be fine. You’ve been on that route before!

That’s what chaos is to me. It’s that feeling that exists for eternity, that the unpredictable could still strike. Hell. You could go even deeper. Why DID the possum cross the road? Was it fleeing a predator? Searching for food? Did it see something it found interesting? Did a random gust of wind blow a piece of trash in an enticing way that caused the possum to investigate, which lead a coyote to spot it and give chase? What caused the wind? Why did the earth's movements seemingly conspire to cripple my sister?

The obvious answer is: they didn’t. There is no plan. Even if we could use science to deduce exactly what caused the possum to dart across the road, it wouldn’t matter. We’d just know. And it wouldn’t make my sister any less crippled. Even if we knew, what could we do? What could we change? Never build roads near possums? Never go out when there’s been snow? Always drive carefully? Never get upset on the road? Don’t swerve to avoid killing a possum? Creating roads that somehow shake or melt off any ice? Some of those suggestions sound reasonable. Some of them sound absurd. Even if we implemented all of them somehow, would it guarantee that nothing bad could happen? I don’t think it would.

That’s chaos. That one simple truth, that there is no one hundred percent predicting anything in this existence. Some turn to religion, or philosophy for comfort. I envy them. I wish I could believe there was a benevolent plan to it all. I wish I could just be comforted existing as we are, finding our place on this floating watery dirt ball in the infinity of the cosmos. But I can’t. I can’t, because I met Chaos. She was pretty cool honestly, if a bit… eccentric. She told me there isn’t a reason. We’re just here. Shit just happens. Our existence is actually pretty well ordered when you get right down to it. Human ingenuity has made it possible to bring quite a bit of order to our world. We’ve even found ways for those who get the shit end of the stick, like my sister, to live happy lives. 

My sister is a motivational speaker now. She’s also competed at high levels of the special Olympics. It’s not what she wanted. But she says she’s happy. I think she’d be a lot happier if she could walk, but my point is, on some level, we should be glad we have as much order as we do. It could be so much worse. Chaos told me. I didn’t believe her. So one of her friends showed me.

My whole story took place a week ago. 

That’s when I met her. I was pretty miserable. I have no direction in life. I don’t know what the hell I want. That makes me depressed sometimes, and I’d rather drink than go to therapy because I’m such a well adjusted human being. I also had a narcissistic tendency to use my sister’s tragedy to fuel my own nihilistic anger and apathy. Why should I bother finding a direction? Why would it even matter?

So after my soul crushing desk job let out, I dragged myself to my usual bar and slinked inside. That was when Chaos first struck. I had no idea who the bartender was. I was on a first name basis with all three bartenders at this bar. So this new guy kind of startled me. I’m straight as an arrow, but I have to admit, the man was handsome. Chiseled muscles, a square jaw, and skin so ridiculously smooth, he must bathe in moisturizer. He looked up at me with a smile that was pure pearly perfection.

“Well, hello! You must be Angus!” The stranger said amicably.

“Not to be rude, but who the heck are you and why do you know my name?” I asked, as I glanced around.

“James told me he had a regular named Angus. Moody guy who shows up at around seven. Favorite swill is Guiness. You look like a moody Angus. Was I right?”

I just kinda blinked, before letting out a sigh. “Yup. That’s me. Open a tab and keep the Guinness coming, please.” I was gonna make a move towards my favorite corner table, where I could sulk in peace, but the bar was completely empty. It felt weird to sit alone in that situation, for some reason. I didn’t want to invite this smooth skinned stranger to talk at me too much either, so the bar itself was out. In the end I took one of the tables near the bar, so the Bartender wouldn’t have to travel far to bring me my drinks. 

The bartender didn’t move as I chose my seat. That annoyed me. “Can I get my beer, please?” I tried not to sound too contemptuous.

“Of course. But you should know, James told me to cut you off after one. Sorry, Angus. No DUI shenanigans.”

“The hell kind of bartender are you? You want my money or not?” I growled back in aggravation.

“You know what’s less fun than a crippled sister? Being the one to cripple a sister. Even more so if it happens just because you wanted a drink.” He had an almost playful smirk on his face as he said it and it shut me right up. At least until I got pissed off.

“Who the hell told you… what gives you the right… I… you’re no fun!” I sputtered in impotent rage.

“Oh, I'm having lots of fun. Just not looking to kill anyone,” he replied, and finally, he poured me my beer. I just sat there seething, while he set it down on a coaster for me.

I kind of stared at it for a while. Making excuses in some ways, and contemplating in others, while the delicious foam on my drink bubbled away. I reached out to pick it up and take a nice long cold sip, but I got cut off. 

“Guy’s a real buzzkill with all that logic, huh?” The voice was a woman’s. It came from literally right next to my ear. I felt warm breath and everything. I must of jolted myself a good three feet and let out the least masculine sound of fright I’d ever made (at least thus far that night). 

I tried desperately to collect myself as I stared at the woman who’d seemingly just materialized next to me. She was completely unassuming. Plain brown hair, plain jeans, a baggy gray sweater with some sort of goofy looking skull on it, and one of those faces that could work on anyone between the ages of twenty-four and forty-four. My lonely self noted how she wasn’t unattractive, by any means, but she wasn’t exactly eye catching either. She wasn’t looking at me. She was looking at the bartender, with a smile that was somewhere between cute, and predatory. “Hi Dennis!” She said girlishly.

I glanced at the smooth-faced bartender. I couldn’t help but notice a bit of tension in his limbs as he eyed the woman. “Hi there Eri… or is it Set?” He said with a smile that housed some fear.

“Yup! Set’s doing his own thing. Call me Azathoth.”

The bartender cocked an eyebrow and smirked in seeming amusement. “Hmm. A bit on-the-nose don’t you think?” He asked pensively.

“What’s on my nose? When are we? Is Howard alive yet?” She replied.

“Dead for almost ninety years now.”

“Aw. Oh well. What do you think, Angus?”

I didn’t respond. I was still recovering from this woman’s sudden appearance and her speaking into my ear. Then she turned her eyes towards me, and I froze up all over again. I don’t even know how to describe them. The color was some sort of yellow, but a sparkling yellow, like some sort of piss-stained galaxy. Her pupils barely focused on anything, and looked like two black holes in her head that sucked the rest of her eyes towards the middle. They had the manic, unfocused quality of a conspiracy theorist that snorted all the crystal meth.

“Good point!” She replied to something I never said.

The bartender suddenly addressed me. “Well, Mr. Angus. I was going to have a chat, but it seems your night has been usurped. My only advice now is try to remember that you aren't dreaming.”

“Bwuh?” I was the only reply I could offer.

The strange woman next to me, cocked her head, and frowned. “Are you leaving Dennis? I’ve only been here for a millenia! You’re like me!”

“We are very alike, my dear Az-y. But you still scare the hell out of me,” the bartender replied.

“Aw. You’re sweet. At least make a fun drink before you go!”

“Anything for you” he replied with a genuine smile. I just sat there, utterly confused and bewildered by the madness that was ensuing. But that would be the most believable part of my evening. The Bartender named Dennis began one of the most elaborate drink mixes I’ve ever seen in my entire life. He literally juggled four different expensive looking bottles and flasks of pricey liquor, pouring out a little from each as they flew, he took a swig and spat fire just for effect, and he even balanced everything in the tip of his nose for a moment. It all ended with a bizarre concoction of almost luminous orange fluid with its surface on fire. He tossed the glass behind his back, only to whip himself in a circle and catch it all unspilled. Then he spun his way to the weird woman, and fell to one knee as he presented the drink to her. Also, all the while, the woman was clapping and cheering like an excitable child watching a puppet show.

The whole performance took about two minutes. He was so incredibly nimble and skilled that I actually forgot my confusion and watched in awe. The woman calling herself Azathoth cheered so energetically, that I clapped too. Azathoth took her drink while Dennis stood back up and took a bow. 

He glanced at me. “I have to go now. Stay awake. And good luck!”

My brain was starting to catch up, by now, and my impression was this strange bartender was about to abandon me (and his business), to the whims of a strange woman who was likely on a lot of drugs. “What do you mean you're leaving?” I asked. He ignored me as he walked toward the door. “Don’t you have to run the bar?”

“The bar is closed” he replied solemnly. Then he stepped outside, and vanished around a corner. Leaving me alone in a very uncomfortable silence. I turned to look at my strange companion, and was unnerved to find her staring right at me, sipping her insane cocktail through a straw (which I swear the bartender didn’t put there).

“I like you.” She said flatly. I was already kind of terrified, but that just made me even more nervous. “You might flirt. I’m not date material, and my ass is shaped like a tesseract.”

If I could have gone blanker, I would have. “What the hell is wrong with you?” I wondered aloud.

“Absolutely!” She replied with a smile. “So! You like thinking about chaos, huh?” She said between little sips. I swear, she never blinked. And no matter how she tilted her head, the black voids of those pupils stayed right on me, even when she turned her head. Well, not quite, I guess. They didn’t seem to focus on anything in particular. Usually you look at people's eyes or face. With her, her eyes just stayed in my direction. I was noting all of this as I tried to think of an answer. 

“I… how did you even… yes, I think about chaos,” I sputtered.

“That’s neat.” She took another long sip, all without taking those insane eyes off of me. “Do you like it?”

“Do I… like chaos?”

“Yeah.”

“I…” until that point I’d been looking for an out. I made one last effort. “We probably shouldn’t be drinking in here if it’s closed.”

She reached across the table, grabbed my beer, tossed back her head and dumped the entire thing down her throat in the span of a few seconds. She casually swallowed, and licked the foam from her lips. Than she tossed the glass behind the bar. I heard it shatter. “There. Now you’re not doing anything wrong,” She stated. I swear her eyes got even wider. “So. Do you like it?”

I’m the sort of person who loves to talk about his personal philosophy. Scared as I was by this highly unusual person who named herself after a lovecraftian nightmare, I was kind of eager to talk to someone. I’d been lonely. “Well. It’s not really something you can like, or not like. It’s kind of random. Sometimes it hurts people I care about, and I curse the universe. Sometimes I end up chatting with a stranger in a bar, and I’m really… happy.”

“I am Chaos. I like what you think.” Her face was blank And she said it in such a deadpan manner that I actually chuckled.

“You’re chaos? I expected more tentacles or something, given your name,” I said, trying to sound good humored. I really didn’t want to make this strange lady angry.

“I never understood that part. I think Lovecraft was just scared of squids. Tentacles are actually very logical limbs in most species.”

“I… huh.”

“Your sister got hurt. Was it chaos’ fault?”

“I… how…” I broke. I just rolled with it. “No. Chaos doesn’t really do anything to spite people.”

She loudly set her empty glass down, startling me with the loud clink, before leaning closer to me and widening her eyes into perfect unnerving circles. “Ohhhh yes I do. I arranged for all of it. Even the possum. The events that hurt your sister started twenty years ago with a deer tick in Ohio. I don’t like hurting people. But I don’t hate it either, I guess.”

That one stung me. I always get irrationally irritated when people talk about my sister. Now this weirdo was claiming they organized it as a god of chaos? “You’re fucking with me, right? You can’t be chaos incarnate.”

“Why?”

“You… you look like a woman.”

“You see a woman. Maybe it’s what I want you to see.” She actually leaned back and broke eye contact for the first time in a while. She looked thoughtful. “OH!” She snapped to attention and stared into my eyes again. “Or maybe this is just what YOU want to see! It’s not like your eyes could see the rest. And your brain? It couldn’t process that information even if your eyes could see it! Or maybe I’m just some lady with a bunch of cats at home!”

“Or maybe it’s all of the above?” I offered after an awkward silence. 

“Exactly!” She squealed in excitement. “So I hurt your sister. I did it intentionally. But is it my fault?”

“Can we not talk about my sister? If you hurt her, I would demand to know why. That’s all I’ll say.”

“There isn’t a why. There never is. I just am. So is the rest of me.” Her eyes trailed off me for a moment. “I wonder what Set is up to?” Then she was back to her bug-eyed staring.

I huffed angrily. “Look, I played along at first, but I think you’re just off your rocker,” she fucking beamed like a child getting a complement. My lack of alcohol, and a stranger shamelessly bringing up my sister had me a bit pissed off. “Chaos isn’t a person. Chaos wouldn’t show up at a shit bar to freak out random dudes.” 

“It’s not like I chose to.”

“Then who the hell did? I think I’m done with this game.”

She cocked her head. “You’re mad. I thought you understood.”

“You claimed you hurt my sister. You said you did it on purpose. I have every right to hate you for that. But you didn’t. You’re not chaos. If you were, I'd still wonder why the hell you couldn’t let this one thing go differently.”

“I don’t make that choice. I’m holding back enough as it is! Don’t be mean!” She said, and she actually looked sort of hurt, but as far as I was concerned she was just some weirdo. 

“You’re a person, lady. I don’t know how the hell you know about my sister but that’s a sore subject. So screw you!” She cocked her head at me again. Silence enveloped us. Then those lips cracked and spread into an absolutely deranged looking grin. I broke eye contact, stood up, and stormed out. “Yeah, whatever, creep.” I mumbled. 

The drive home started out uneventful. I wandered down the whole block, seething and cursing under my breath the whole way, wishing I’d gotten just one damn drink. When I reached my car, I dropped my keys, and almost lost them. Then, as I drove, I swear I hit every red light, and random slow-moving asshole that this town had.

With little miss ‘Chaos’ still on my mind, I screamed “FUCK YOU AZATHOTH” as I was cut off for the fifth time. I was fuming, and thinking about all the reasons I hated everything for hurting my poor sister. But part of me felt a little guilty. Whoever she was, she was quirky, but she sure seemed sad about me yelling at her. Ugh. I hate having empathy sometimes. I stopped at the umpteenth red light and gazed up at myself in the rear view mirror. I swear it was like I didn’t even recognize the tired, bitter, eyes staring back at me. ‘What are you looking at?’ I sneered. I reached up and flicked my mirror, right where my eyes were. I had to stop them because for a second I thought my reflection blinked without me. But that was silly. 

I sighed. “She was out of line” I reasoned. “Maybe I’m in a shit mood, and she didn’t deserve to be sworn at, but seriously. Who tells a person ‘I hurt your sister on purpose’? She was out of line.” Finally the light changed and I pulled onto the highway.

I settled back into my fuming as I rode through the dark. It took me a while to realize something was off. I drove on autopilot, barely minding my surroundings. It took a good fifteen minutes for me to realize I should have reached my usual exit a while ago. I snapped into focus. 

“Where the hell am I?” It was the same nondescript stretch of road you could find anywhere in America. There were streetlights every hundred yards or so, and I even saw some fellow motorists, so I wasn’t too concerned. But I got more and more confused. I never saw any street signs, or exits, and it was absurdly dark, despite the lights. I looked to my phone for guidance. “Hey siri, where am I?” I asked my phone tentatively. 

I waited for a reply. All I got was “data not found.” That’s when I started to worry.

“Hey Siri? Take me home.”

“Data not found.”

“Hey Siri? Where’s a McDonald’s?”

“Data not found.”

At that point I pulled myself over to the side of the road to see if I could figure things out.

My phone may as well have been a brick. No service, data usuage wasn’t working for some fucking reason, and it could do nothing to give me an inkling of where I was. I tried calling friends, but of course, that didn’t work either. 

“What the actual fuck!?” I snarled. I tossed the phone angrily into the passenger seat, and took a few deep breaths. Then I stared out my window, hoping to identify something in my surroundings, but like I said, it was just a nondescript highway. Other motorists continued to cruise by, some trees sat on the other side, barely visible in the edge of the streetlight, giving them the look of spindly shadowy figures. They moved slightly with some unseen wind. Something was just wrong with all of it, and I’m ashamed to admit it took me as long as it did to realize what it was.

There weren’t any stars. Everything above me was just plain black. A cloudy night could explain that, but the moon was still clearly visible. Bright and full. I glanced up at it. I got more confused. It had no shadows, or features at all. It was just a plain white circle. I tried squinting to see if I noticed a sheet of clouds or something but then, the white circle vanished. It was quick, but I watched it happen. It was like two sheets of black sky slid toward one another from the top and bottom of the moon (relative to me, mind you) until they completely blocked it out, and the white circle vanished. It lasted less than a second, and then the sky slid apart again and the moon was back.

My brain almost broke trying to make sense of what I’d just witnessed, but then the insidious thought occurred to me. ‘Did the moon just blink at me?’

As if to confirm it, it did it again. I kind of broke. The sky was blinking at me. I tried to rationalize for maybe two minutes, before it happened a third time. Then I started to wonder, ‘oh shit. Did I say ‘screw you’ to chaos herself? It can’t be.’ 

I looked away from the moon, and back towards the road. I happened to notice another car cruising by, but then I realized there was nobody driving it, and it had no windows or doors. I looked toward the shadowy trees, and I almost wasn’t surprised to see movement within the spindly shadows, as though the trees had come to life and formed some sort of monstrous shadowy spider. Just to cap it off, a freaking frowny face made of red light, winked into existence. Like an emoji within the squirming shadows.

“This has to be a hallucination,” I said to myself. “It’s a dream.” 

But then I remembered the bartender. He’d said “remember, you aren’t dreaming.”

‘Okay, if I’m not dreaming, then the sky is blinking, and a tree spider with an emoji face is making its way towards me…’ you might be wondering why I seem so calm. Truth be told, I wasn’t. I was scared, but until that very moment I wasn’t convinced I was in any true danger. But as I watched the red emoji’s frowny face twist itself into a smile… the dams broke. Panic set in. I screamed for all I was worth, slammed the petal to the floor and almost lost control of my car as I peeled out onto the road.

I glanced at the mirror, and saw some unspeakable thing, a twisted mish mash of spidery limbs all joining together at a single point, and that single point was now an upside down smiley face gazing toward me as it shrank into the distance. My heart was beating through my chest, I focused on driving, breathing, and ignoring the blinking moon which had migrated across the sky towards the horizon I was driving towards. What little light there was on the road literally started to dance as the streetlights turned themselves to shine towards me as I passed, like they were made of rubber and not steel. Meanwhile the road lines on either side of me started slithering. 

“Nope!” I said to myself as my terror mounted. “Not acknowledging any of that.” Several of the cars I was sharing the road with revealed themselves to be, shall we say, unusual. One of them was running on legs, like a horses, rather than rolling along. Another vehicle I approached, that I thought resembled a semi, seemed to have millipede legs carrying it along, but at least the car that started riding my ass seemed normal enough. At least until I realized the headlights had become eyes, and the grill was a mouth with sharp wiry teeth.

By that point, I figured I’d suffered a massive psychotic break. Somehow my terror took a back seat to this realization, and I calmly pulled myself to the side of the road again, reasoning it wasn’t safe to drive. The other cartoonish monsters around me barely acknowledged me. They just kept driving along, going wherever the hell they were going. I sat there trying desperately to calm my beating heart. “It’s not real.” I said. I repeated it over and over again.

I only picked up speed when I glanced back in the rear view mirror and saw a glowing red smiley face speeding towards me through the dark. 

“It’s not real. It’s not real. That bartender was nuts. It’s not real.” This writhing shadowy mass I could barely see squirmed it’s way straight to my car. Soon the red emoji face took up my entire rear window. But it just sat there, gazing in at me (… I guess?). “It’s not real. It’s not real.” I black limb with wildly branching digits and what looked like bark on its surface reached around and seemed to wave at me through my front window. “IT'S NOT REAL!” I shouted at the thing. In response, it dragged a pointing tip along the roof of my car. I sat there and listened to the sound of (expensive) scratching on my roof. “It’s not real.” I glanced up at the mirror. The red face was now a winking emoji. As calmly as I could, I reached up and pushed my rear view mirror until I couldn’t see the face anymore. Then I sat there blubbering in the dark red light. I tried to ignore it when it started flashing on and off, and the thing started making a whooping sound. “It’s not real,” I repeated yet again.

Suddenly there was a gentle tap on my window. I heard a voice outside. “Sir? Is everything okay in there?” I struggled for a second. It could be the fiends outside trying to trick me after all. But in the end, the promise of a normal voice was too great. I looked up.

There was a completely normal looking man in a police uniform standing outside my door. “I’m gonna need you to roll down the window sir. Slowly.” I just kinda blinked for a few seconds. I glanced around. The moon was no longer full, and it had its trademark shapes and shadows barely visible from here on Earth. The stars were back in the sky, and nothing was moving that shouldn’t have been moving. Also all the cars had tires. 

I risked a glance behind me, out my back window. For a brief moment, I thought the lights there were the red eyes of the tree-spider-thing. But it was just the flashing lights of a police cruiser. The nightmare was seemingly over.

Let’s just say I wasn’t able to convince the kind officer that I wasn’t on any kind of substance. He took me to lockup “for my well being” and they ran some tox screens which would all come back negative. I spent a few hours in a holding cell, contemplating everything and trying to figure out who I should call. They released me at roughly two thirty in the morning. Someone was there waiting for me. That someone almost gave me a panic attack. The police escorted me into the main room, and I seriously considered running back into prison when I saw Azathoth waving at me. “Hi Angus!” She said cheerfully. I’m fairly certain I never told her my name.

“Uh.” I replied.

“Your friend here says she’ll get you an Uber home. We’ll forward you the address where your car was towed. Drive safe, sir.” The officer said dismissively.

What could I do? I followed Azy outside.

She was on a phone, who’s make and model I'm pretty sure doesn't exist, apparently summoning an Uber for me. “Just so you know?” She said as I approached. “I didn’t really have anything to do with that. When you say ‘screw you’ to one of the many anthropomorphic avatars of chaos, it gets the attention of other things.”

“None of it was real. I had a psychotic break,” I insisted.

“I mean… that’s not untrue,” she replied, still not looking up. “A friend of mine lives in mirrors. He was checking you out. You happened to touch the mirror he was using and got partially pulled through to a place where all reflective surfaces act as portals.”

“I… reflective surfaces?”

“Yup! You know, like the moon, or the paint on roads, or mirrors. You’re really lucky you touched the mirror again and got yourself out. Or, maybe, like you said, you’re just going a bit crazy, right?”

“How do you explain that tree-spider-emoji thing?”

She stopped what she was doing, furrowed her brow, and stared blankly at me. “The what?”

“That thing that came from the trees!“

She stared at me with skepticism I can only describe as infuriating. “‘Tree-spider-emoji thing?’ What the hell are you talking about?”

“It chased me!”

“I… I have no idea what that was. Maybe you are crazy.” Her eyes lit up. “Or maybe it’s something new!”

I was beyond my limit. “What the fuck ever. Why are you here? How do you know my name?”

“No idea. Maybe I felt bad. Maybe I'm a sadist. Maybe I'm flirting. I just wanted to let you know, I don’t do grudges, or vengeance. I don’t do anything on purpose. But I do everything. What did or didn’t happen to you tonight had nothing to do with being mean to me before.”

“Mean? Lady, you claimed you hurt my sister on purpose!”

“Intentionally. But not on purpose. I don’t have purpose, silly. I just am. Just like you.”

I didn’t really have an answer to that.

“You’re ride will be here soon. You’ll have to pay. I don’t do money. See you later!” She walked away and turned down an alley. I have no idea where she went after that. For all I know, she just vanished into the air. Something about her words resonated with me. ‘I just am, just like you.’

It made me feel weirdly good about things. What happened to my sister, all the sadness and hate in the world, everything wrong with my life, and the world around us, not much of it is anyone’s plan. Most of it just is, and maybe that’s okay. 

I contemplated all the way home, and almost forgot to tip the driver. The next day, I’d decided whatever happened to me was some sort of stress induced hallucination. Mirror portals would be insane. So I called an Uber again to take me to pick up my car. And now, I’m not so sure what is and isn’t crazy. When I finally reached my vehicle, I couldn’t help but notice the scratches in my roof that definitely weren’t there last night. I remembered the tree-spider. “Someone must have done this last night while it was here,” I told myself. Then my phone vibrated. I received a text from an unknown number. Just a series of emojis. 

“☹️🙂🙃😉 … 😡” 

Chaos just is. You can’t really control everything. Even our laws of physics theoretically are slaves to chaos. You might step off a curb and fall into another dimension. But I really wish the randomness of the universe would fuck off for a while.
