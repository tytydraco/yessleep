I’m writing because the last few days have been some of the most taxing I’ve ever experienced, and I need advice… or maybe not advice exactly. I just need help making sure I’m not losing my mind.

It all started a few days ago. I won’t lie — I was a bit under the influence, scrolling through some Reddit 50/50s. You know, the page that gives you two possible outcomes: one wholesome like puppies, the other usually something gross or NSFW. The twist is, you don’t get to choose — it’s random what you’ll see when you click.

It had been a long, stressful week at work, so I planned to unwind. I was drinking — about a beer per page — so by the time I hit page 13, I was definitely feeling it. That’s when I came across a strange link:

“Puppy Bowl Greatest Plays” or “The Truth Behind the Uncanny Valley.”

I chuckled and said, “Let’s do it.” Needless to say, it wasn’t the Puppy Bowl.

It linked to a plain webpage with just a video player — no title, no description. Still in the spirit of the game, I clicked play. A cold, mechanical voice began narrating the four-minute video:

“The Uncanny Valley is a theory introduced in 1970 by Masahiro Mori, a Japanese robotics expert. It describes the relationship between how human-like something appears, and how we emotionally respond to it.”

A graph appeared on the screen as the voice continued.

“The most unsettling point is at the bottom of the valley — when something looks almost human, but something is… off.”

A few AI-generated images and robotic faces flashed across the screen. They weren’t grotesque, but something about them made me deeply uneasy.

“It’s normal to feel discomfort or fear when you see images like these. But where does that fear come from?”

Suddenly, the page glitched and started to freak out — flashing distorted images of AI art. The voice came back, but it no longer sounded robotic. It sounded… human, but wrong. Just slightly off.

“The fear is primal. It comes from a deep, ancient part of your species’ memory. An evolutionary response to something that looked human… but wasn’t. Something dangerous.”

“What the fuck is this?” I muttered, frantically clicking the close button — but the video wouldn’t stop.

“We’ve always been here,” the voice said. “A random face in the crowd. And you never notice. But when you do… you look away. You keep walking.”

Panic rising, I held down the power button on my desktop. The voice cut off mid-sentence, but not before the screen flashed one final image: a video feed from my own webcam.

It showed me — but the face on the screen was smiling. The smile was wide, too wide, with porcelain-white teeth that were eerily straight.

Shaking, I poured a glass of whiskey to steady my nerves and went to bed… but I was up and down all night. 
 
        
I wish I could tell you that the night ended there—a scary video and a panic attack, washed away by a pint of Jack. But I’d be lying if I said that was all.

The next morning, I woke up nursing a brutal hangover on top of barely any sleep. My eyes burned, the bitter, sour taste of bile clung to the back of my throat, and my head pounded like a war drum. I knew I needed to eat, but I had zero motivation to cook. Eventually, I mustered the strength to get dressed and stumble down to the local deli.

I ordered my usual: sausage, egg, and cheese with a hashbrown tucked in, plus a black coffee. The cashier stared at me—probably because I looked like hell—but said nothing, just rang me up. A few minutes later, she called my name. I stepped up to grab my sandwich, and she was staring again.

Uncomfortable, I tried to break the tension. “Sorry, I’m kind of a mess. Had a long night.”

She blinked and suddenly seemed to snap out of it. “Oh! I’m sorry, sir. I don’t know why, but I could’ve sworn I served you earlier this morning. Weird. Anyway, have a great day!”

She brushed it off and returned to the register like nothing had happened.

If I weren’t so hungover, I might’ve asked her what she meant. But I felt like death, and I knew if I didn’t get food in me fast, I’d redecorate the deli floor. So I made a beeline for my apartment. And that’s when things started to get weird again.

My computer monitor was off—but the webcam light was on.

How long had it been like that? Had it ever turned off? Was it recording?

I reached to unplug it, bumping the desk in the process. The screen flickered on. My stomach dropped.

“What the hell is going on!?” I yelled.

The video was still playing.

That same face—way too close to the camera—filled the screen. It began speaking again, completely unfazed:

“Your brain has two options. The first is to try to make sense of it. This often presents as déjà vu, or a vague feeling that you’ve seen something before, even though you haven’t.”

It paused.

The silence dragged on—long enough to make my skin crawl.

Then it continued.

“The second option is fear. Most will call it paranoia, or maybe agita. A vague discomfort at seeing a stranger you think you recognize. They’re the smart ones.”

It smiled then.

That awful, hideously perfect porcelain smile—impossibly white teeth, too many of them.

“My question for you is this: next time you see one of us, how will you respond? Will you fear us… or brush us off, like that cute girl at the deli? Oh well, we won’t have to wait much longer to find out…”

It chuckled, and the screen cut to black. Then it rebooted to a blue screen.

All I could hear was the pounding of my heart, thudding like it was trying to escape my chest.
