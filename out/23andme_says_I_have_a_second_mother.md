This summer, I decided to get my DNA sequenced by 23andme. I wanted to know my ancestry, as well as find out if I'm a carrier for any genetic disorders, since my husband and I want to try and get pregnant soon.

When the results came back, everything was what I expected. I was Romanian and German. I had the sun-sneeze reflex. Etc. The surprise came when I clicked on the "Relatives" tab. At the top of the list, it showed my parents.

Except, there weren't two parents.

There were *three*.

**John T.**

*Father, 50.0% DNA shared*

**Agnes T.**

*Mother, 50.0% DNA shared*

**G**

*Mother, 50.0% DNA shared*

I stared at the last one. *Uh… what?* I scrolled up and down the list, but the rest looked normal. One of my brothers came up, along with an aunt and some cousins.

Curious, I clicked on G's profile. But there wasn't any other information. To see details, like her ancestry or shared relatives, I'd need to 'connect' with her.

*Probably just a glitch or something. Or maybe my mom made two accounts by accident.* I closed my laptop and tried to forget about it.

But for the rest of the day, it bothered me. Like a little itch in the back of my brain. *Maybe it isn't a duplicate account or a total glitch. Maybe she's some secret aunt or something, and 23andme just overestimated the shared DNA.* I'd read the horror stories, of 23andme uncovering family secrets like that.

So that evening, I decided to hit "Connect." I didn't really expect her to accept.

But just a few days later, she did.

I went over to the 23andme website, my heart pounding. When I scrolled down, I saw my ancestry composition and G’s, side-by-side. Her ancestry looked like my mom’s—almost 100% Romanian. But… it was slightly different.

My heart pounded faster. I opened three tabs: my mom’s ancestry, my dad’s, G’s, and mine. My eyes darted between them, comparing them. Studying them. And after several minutes, I realized it.

I was 1% Scandinavian. But neither my mother nor my father had any Scandinavian ancestry.

Only “G” did.

A chill went down my spine. I stared at G’s profile. At her empty profile picture.

*Who* is *she?*

\*\*\*

I told my husband all about it. He thought I was overreacting. “It’s just some glitch,” he said, as he flipped the chicken on the stove. “23andme must’ve sequenced the DNA wrong, or mixed up the samples, or something.”

“It’s creepy though, isn’t it?”

“Yeah, I guess.” He opened the cabinet, rummaging around for plates. “But there’s just so much room for error with that DNA stuff.”

I tried not to think about it. But my night was plagued with nightmares of G—a faceless woman, calling from the forest. Who had my long dark hair and tall stature. A second mother who, somehow, had given me her DNA.

When I woke up, though, I realized something. If I shared 50% of my DNA with my father, and my mother, *and* G—well, 50% + 50% + 50% did not equal 100%.

One of my parents had to share DNA with G.

I called my mom on the way to work. “Did you see anyone listed in your DNA relatives named ‘G’?” I asked, as I pulled onto the highway.

“G?” she repeated.

“Yeah. There’s just… a person named G who keeps popping up on my DNA relatives.”

“I don’t think so,” she replied. “But I don’t know. The website is kind of hard to use. Brandon was helping me with it.”

“Could you ask—”

“Yeah, sure. Gotta go now, though.”

With that being a dead end, I decided to bite the bullet and send G a message. Most likely, it’d be some big misunderstanding. G was probably some stranger living on the other end of the country with no connection to me whatsoever.

**Hey, I noticed 23andme listed you as a relative. Do you have any family members with the last name T--- or K---, especially in the northwest US? Are you related to my mother, Agnes T---?**

The response came less than an hour later. And when I read it, a slow chill ran down my spine.

**you will find out soon enough.**

That was the whole thing. The whole response. Those cryptic six words. I quickly shot a message back: **Are you related to me? Or my mom?**

No answer.

I stared at the screen, my heart pounding. Then, in one swift motion, I moved my cursor up and removed her as a connection. *Just a troll. A scammer. Something weird like that.*

A few days later, I checked 23andme again—to find that G had removed her account. Or, possibly, that the glitch had been fixed. Because G was no longer listed as my mother, or a relative at all.

Weeks went by and I forgot about the whole thing. Work got busy, gardening season was in full swing, and my hours were spent either working late in the office or slaving over my plant babies. I didn’t even give G a second thought—

Until, one morning, it all came crashing down.

Two pink lines. My husband and I spent the morning crying, hugging each other, overjoyed about this little person we would bring into the world.

Until I went to the mailbox.

Inside was a folded piece of pink paper, tied off with black ribbon. No stamp—it must’ve been hand delivered. My throat went dry as I flipped it open and read the words on the page.

**meet me at d--- park at midnight tonight.**

**-G**
