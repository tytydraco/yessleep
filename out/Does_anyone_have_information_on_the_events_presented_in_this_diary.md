The following text was recovered from a diary discovered by Adirondack wilderness park rangers in a damaged fire pit on Lake Lila, Hamilton County, NYS, March 22, 2019. There was no identifying text or name attached. And no loved ones have claimed it. It was disposed of as simply litter. I have decided to upload it online to see if anyone has knowledge about the text and the writer. Thank you.

December 13:

Not much happened today. My job is sooo boring. No one even checks in during this time of the year. So they expect me to work on Christmas! 

December 14: 

Something weird happened today. An older woman checked into the hotel. She looked cold and kind of wet, and a little sickly, but otherwise seemed nice. Only thing weird was when I handed her key off, she kind of gripped my hand and looked at me. Like she was in a trance. Then she quickly shook her head and left for her room.

December 15:

Okay something really bizarre happened. A room service girl called me to get the extra room key for 127. There was only one occupied room when I left. The old ladie’s. I just assumed that in her age she overslept or had a medical issue. 

When I got there a couple other workers were lingering and trying to knock on the door to get the woman up. But After I unlocked and opened the door, there was no one. No evidence someone occupied the room, besides the window being open.

We immediately contacted the local authorities, a police officer came and looked around. They needed a name to put out a Silver alert. I looked through the guest registry, but there was nothing. How? I swear I would have put it in, it’s not like we were that busy.

After that I was super nervous and jittery. I went home late and it was snowing fairly bad. I couldn’t see the road ahead of me, and out of nowhere, a deer appeared. And I hit it. I pulled over, but I couldn’t bring myself to get out of the car. I just went home.

December 16:

Okay now I’m creeped out. I came into work today and was called into my bosses office. I was terrified, what if I got fired for not recording stuff properly, what if I killed a lady? But…nothing, he just told me he was moving me to room service since winter break is starting tomorrow. 

I asked around in the building seeing if anyone knew what happened, I looked on the local news, I looked everywhere and everyone just looked at me weird. It’s like it never happened.

When I was driving home tonight I was tense. Luckily nothing happened. But it felt like it was taking way longer to drive home. I kept checking my phone to make sure I hadn’t gone down the wrong road. But it was the same route, I was even speeding because it wasn’t snowing. I’m still not sure what happened.

December 17: 

I think i’m crazy. Luckily I got the early shift. So there wasn’t much to do, after I set up a few rooms me and [REDACTED] just decided to talk and smoke in the upstairs parlor. I went to the parlor to grab [REDACTED]’s phone. When I walked in, my heart dropped. The same woman, the same woman who disappeared was checking in. 

I stood still, not knowing what I was waiting for. She looked sicker, along with several bandages and patches all over. I sort of just tried to ignore her and quickly grabbed the phone and walked upstairs. When I walked upstairs she followed, and grabbed my hand in the same way as before. She looked deep into my eyes, this time with rage.

When I left it was horribly cold. It was only 1:00 PM but it was as cold as midnight. It felt like my nose was burning every time I breathed. The same thing happened as I went home as the night before. It took longer though. The rest of the night, no matter how warm it was on the thermostat or how many blankets I piled. I was still freezing.

December 18:

I walked into work. It feels like you’re pressing on a nerve every time I move. I go about my day. There’s surprisingly few people checked in. I don’t think much of it though, it’s still early in the season.

It gets colder and colder every minute. Most of the workers are…off. They speak slower and incredibly loud, their skin is dry and pale, and their hair is thinner than it should be. They stay away from me, I walked in on a room full of them. Doing nothing but, standing and screaming.

I got called to clean out a room. Which is bizarre, you don’t get many single night check-ins before Christmas. Walking in, there was nothing. Besides an open window and a light red stain on the wall. 

I decided to time my drive home, just to see if I was actually being delusional, going constantly 60. 4:00 PM-7:00 PM, 3 hours for a three mile drive.

December 19:

I don’t leave my bed, I can hardly even reach for my desk. Drinking water is like choking down glass. None of my family comes to see what’s happening. At about noon the cold seems to get better. I hobble down stairs, no one. I knock on every door, my parents room, my sister’s room. Nothing. 

I look outside. Everyone’s car is here. I go to the kitchen, there are multiple cabinets open. And several bags torn. I look out the window, I see a deer in the backyard. Something’s wrong with it. Nothing terribly bizarre but it’s just twitching and moving…towards the house. I lock eyes with it. In my gut I know I have to run

I run upstairs, I barricade my door, lock every window, close the blinds and hide. Constantly for the rest of the day, I hear something trying to get in. I don’t move for the entire rest of the day.

December 20 (possibly?):

I hear nothing today. I leave the building as fast as I can, grab the gun from the garage and get in my car. I am never heading home. The cold is back. I just press the peddle and never look back, I look out the window. It’s darker outside than it should be.

I drive past the resort, I planned on going to the nearest town [REDACTED.] By 6:00 PM I had driven about half a mile past the resort. I hit the breaks. And just sat in my car, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t scream or cry. I just froze.

I decide to turn around and just head into the resort. I walk in and I pass out.

December 25 (likely): 

I wake up in my bed, somehow. I hobble down stairs, my entire body aching. I remember nothing. I’m reading through my diary to see what could have happened. I’m going to head outside. I don’t know where anyone is.

I find it difficult to stand up straight. I have to crawl to even try to get around. I feel every nerve in my head. 

December 26:

He can’t flex his fingers or toes. It seems to be going well.

January 1:

I have brought him to the herd. He is strong for his age.

January 26:

Thank you.

June 15:

His blood is strong and he has fully assimilated into his new role. I have done well.
