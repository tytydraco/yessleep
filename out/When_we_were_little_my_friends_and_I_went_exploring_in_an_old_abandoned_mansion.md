We trekked up and down the side of the highway, the summer sun never letting up. Between the five of us, no one thought to bring any water. But we were young, and stubborn.

Deb spotted a dead armadillo, relatively intact. The rest of us decided it was too big to fit.

Arnold found the cat—squashed thin enough to be nearly invisible in the tall, prickly weeds. The body was only slightly thicker than a pancake.

“Good eye,” I said.

“What do you think, Ben?” Arnold wiped sweat off his shaved head.

I nodded, and led the march back to the old moldering mansion.

 Last winter, every realtor in town agreed to finally abandon the property. Till then, they’d try about once a decade to unload it on an unsuspecting homeowner. Someone new to the county.

At the time, our town didn’t host many rich folks up for restoring a once-great palace. In fact, anyone in a Rolls Royce or Porshe passing by usually drove through as fast as possible. Which was dangerous, since the roads were winding and bent sharply. Accidents waiting to happen.

The mansion was a sinkhole for money and effort, and worse…cut off from the rest of town by the owl-haunted woods encircling it. A place where decay reigned and trees were just dead branches, spread out like skeleton hands.

So of course it made the perfect secret clubhouse for us kids. You only had to squeeze under the rusted barbed wire fencing that blocked off the acres of the property. That never bothered us. Tetanus shots were in the far back of our tiny minds.

Arnold handed the cat off to me so he could hold the wire up for Deb. She passed without having to crawl on her belly in the mud like Jamie did before, without complaint.

 It was understood that Arnold was sweet on Deb (at least, to everyone except Arnold). That’s why she had been allowed to learn our big secret. That afternoon was to be her first time participating in the ceremony.

Tall front doors could just barely be found under the conquering ivy which had expanded across the house’s entire front. No one bothered using the gilded knocker—it was always unlocked. Anything inside worth stealing had been dragged out and auctioned before the grown-ups left the place to fend for itself among the wild elements.

Arnold held Deb’s hand, leading her inside. Outside it sweltered hot, but on crossing the threshold, a welcome coolness descended. Deb shivered in her sundress.

Like everything else, the furniture was ransacked. To rest, we sat on the floor. Splinters and rusty nails stuck out in all sorts of innocuous places, and had to be carefully avoided. Wallpaper peeled and fell to the ground like discarded orange rinds.

What that left were wide empty spaces for us to run around in, play, and hang out without parents busting in and ordering us to do chores. Though not without flaws, it was all ours. Due to rot and mold, some preferred wearing rags or bandanas over our mouths. But me? I breathed deeply.

Deb stuck out her tongue. In a corner, a spider was drinking a fly’s innards. Clay saw this too, and blanched. Jamie moved closer.

 I ignored the miniature horror show. “Let’s do this, so I don’t have to carry this cat anymore.”

A couple marble steps of what had been a spiral staircase to a second, third, and fourth floor were intact. After that point, it dropped off into void. We’d never find out what lay up there. Perhaps the magic only worked *because* we never actually saw it happening.

I marched ahead to the kitchen. I’ll never forget what the dumbwaiter looked like. It was metal, rectangular, about a foot wide and a foot and a half high, with two ropes hanging under it. When you pulled the right one, the tray and anything on it went up. Tugging the left rope realigned some counterweights, lowering the device.

Sending things up always proved harder than bringing them back. Sometimes it took two, or even three of us to hoist it. Me, Arnold, Jamie, Clay, everyone except Deb had gotten to use it.

So now Deb had the distinguished honor of lifting the elevator solo. She proved mightier than her small frame might indicate, needing no help to take the dead cat to the top.

We heard a whirling of wheels and gears, and the jingling of chains. Despite its age, the box always followed smoothly along its tracks. The ride back down only required a single pull on Deb’s part. From inside the closed chamber, something yowled and clawed to get out.

Once we opened the door, it looked like the kitty had been reinflated. Released from that cramped space, it purred and licked itself clean. We fought over who’d get to keep it. After a few rounds of rock-paper-scissors, Jamie came out victorious.

Okay… so our last summer as grade-schoolers hadn’t gone quite how we expected. I hadn’t been first inside the mansion. That was Jamie.

I didn’t spot the dumbwaiter. That was Clay. But when I entered the kitchen, where a meal hadn’t been prepared in half a century, I was the one to start playing with the dumbwaiter.

Out of that mix of curiosity and boredom preceding any great scientific discovery, I tugged on the right rope. The chain at the top of the box looped around a wheel I couldn’t see. But I heard grinding.

The corrugated steel dumbwaiter looked empty at first. No requested plate of food for the masters upstairs. But there was one object, easy to miss. I saw a dead housefly. So small. Totally inconsequential from my perspective. And not at all hard to raise up.

I pulled as far as I could with my geeky boy strength, for the same prideful reason men at carnivals hit bells with a hammer. Muffled clattering let me know the box had gone as far as it could. I tugged the left rope lightly. Trying not to break my new toy.

The tray slid most of the way on its own. I heard the echo of buzzing inside when I slid open the outer door. Right there, crawling on the dumbwaiter’s wall, was a living fly.

Being June, flies were normally everywhere. In the dark cool mansion, however, the only living things except us children was mold. But maybe only the first floor lacked bugs. Flies could be swarming on the upper stories, and one happened to get inside. But then, where’d the dead fly go?

To test it, I got Arnold to find something bigger—a dead spider. Every corner of the mansion was draped with cobwebs, but no recent weavings.

Even so, good old Arnold came through. I miss him so much.

I heaved the spider up. When the lift came back down from its adventure between the walls, there was a living, moving spider. Lucky for the fly it had already buzzed off.

Jamie wanted to prod the arachnid with a stick “For science.” But none of us guys wanted to get close. She called us all “A bunch of big babies.”

Looking back, we should have seen the signs earlier that something was off about Jamie. It would have saved a lot of people a lot of pain.

Our experiments continued the next day and onward. We knew barely anything of theology. Whether this was a miracle, or something from the other place that smells like rotten eggs. Nor did we care—only that the process worked. Right before our eyes.

We started small. Earthworms that crawled out onto the sidewalks at dawn, only to be fried up before noon. Now, the slimy blind suicidal crawlers were free to wiggle in the soil in peace. Our ambitions only grew with time.

We competed to find bigger and bigger animals, though the dumbwaiter’s dimensions limited us. Every subject we brought was dead when we picked it up.  

We swore to keep the truth between us. Heaven forbid some bullying creep like Tyler, or his cronies Andy and Hunter, discovered the magic lift. They’d probably shoot an animal just to see if they could bring it back while the meat was still fresh, then shoot it again.

But everyone liked Deb, even if not as much as Arnold. We trusted her to use our newfound power over life and death responsibly, and with kindness.

“We should invite someone else to join the Resurrection Club,” said Clay. “More eyes on the ground means more animals.”

“Ooh, let’s ask Margot,” Deb said in her eager, high-pitched voice. “She’s cool! And she wouldn’t be grossed out by our mission.”

“Yeah, but not Aaron,” said Jamie. “He’s *too much* of a weirdo for us.”

Turns out, we didn’t get the time to add any more members to our group. We can feel thankful for that, I guess.

Whenever our neighbors’ pets were sick and old, they had to be “Put to sleep.” Of course my friends and I knew that was code, just like there wasn’t really “A farm upstate.” So, we’d take the body (providing it hadn’t already been cremated), restored it, and presented it to the same child who had loved the animal. It seemed like their companion really had just been taking a nap. Now, they came awake to play another day.

The moms and dads never grew suspicious at our club’s charity. I guess each assumed their child’s playmate was an identical replacement that the other parent had gone out and bought.

Whether domestic or wild, we all felt sorry for those poor beasts we found run over. In those cases, we were smart. Making sure to wear gloves through the whole operation, avoiding being bitten or scratched when the roadkill returned to life.

Arnold tried not to feel upset by how ungrateful the raccoons and possums seemed to behave towards us, their saviors. Jamie said they were only acting on instinct.

Those wild things which didn’t flee immediately were carried back to nature in Clay’s red wagon. They could start their new existences far away from the holocaust of the highway.

Arnold refused to give up the turtle he resurrected. It became his pet. Given how long they live, the animal's probably outlived him.

And the domestic animals that had been strays in life were quickly adopted by our other friends. Those kids would never know where their pets came from. Frankly, they didn’t need to.

The possibility of a black-market pet trade always hovered in the air. Our allowances did need supplementing, after all. Yet when Jamie broached the subject aloud, the rest of us voted her down.

The club decided to test things besides animals. I found some rotten fruit in a grocery store dumpster. Like nothing at all, they were brought back to a state of pure freshness.

They smelled sweet—nothing like the former stink of trash bins. I donated everything to the food bank at my parents’ church. And if they spoiled again before any needy people claimed them, I could always refresh them again.

The five of us smiled to each other often during that summer. However unorthodox, we were doing some good in the world!

Not even in Sixth Grade, we were yet wise enough not to be too blatant about our gift. Consequently, we never traveled to the mansion as a whole group. A crowd could get noticed by strangers, and easily trailed. Ones and twos were safe.

By July, we’d started daring each other to find the most unlikely things to bring back. From a display case at my dad’s work, I absconded with a stuffed taxidermy bird. Something yellow. A canary, maybe?

“It can’t come back,” insisted Jamie. “It’s just feathers on a wooden frame.” Arnold and Clay stared at me, uneasy. Deb had skipped club because her dad was back in town. Jamie’s smug grin was set in her face.

But after traveling down the shaft, the bird was very much alive and well. Its glass eyes had popped out, now jostling on the floor like marbles. In their place, shining black eyes had regrown. The bird took off straight away, finding egress up a chimney, chirping happily the whole time.

“Huh.” Jamie leaned against a counter. “Maybe it’ll bring anything to life!” The next time our club convened, she’d brought a wooden doll. Technically, it was alive when it returned to the first floor. But if Jamie was expecting a dancing, talking, capering Pinocchio, she’d have to settle for a houseplant.

The wood that made the doll itself was what had come to life. Bits of paint flaked off green, springy branches. What had been legs were now roots. Already, leaves budded.

Jamie pitched a fit over losing her toy, but what the dumbwaiter wrought couldn’t be reversed. We found a spot with plenty of sunlight to plant the beginnings of a tree. It’s still there. I hear that Clay trims its dead branches sometimes.

Back during that summer, Clay brought a rock. One of those stones with prehistoric sea shells embedded on its surface. None of us knew how long those shells had been fossilized, but they were alive on coming back down.

Arnold thought he’d found the ultimate dare. He brought a can of oil siphoned from the gas station where his old man worked. “See, I heard this stuff’s really ancient. It even used to be dinosaurs!” The rest of us agreed a pet dinosaur would be cool…but difficult to hide from our parents.

We shouldn’t have worried. When the elevator came down, there was no dinosaur, nor any creature at all. The can had ferns growing out of it. Turns out, prehistoric ferns look exactly like the modern kind.

“So boring,” complained Jamie.

Arnold bowed his head. “Oh. I really thought it would be a dinosaur. Hope my pa didn’t catch me taking his gas for nothing.”

Deb patted him on the back. “It was a good try, anyway.”

Deb got inspired by this, next time bringing some amber jewelry with bugs inside. This was a grave mistake, because while magic brought the insects back to life, it didn’t melt away the amber.

The yellow-orange stones shuddered. While otherwise paralyzed, we saw compound eyes moving. Bugs desperately trying to figure out what was going on before they suffocated once again.

Clay wasn’t sure whether we should declare this experiment a success or a failure. Jamie insisted we get some ice cream.

We were nearing the end of July, and wondering whether we’d still be coming to the mansion after school started.

“I don’t see why not,” said Clay.

“The Resurrection Club lives on!” said Deb.

Jamie had to be talked out of resurrecting a cheeseburger. As Arnold pointed out, why waste good food for only *part* of a cow?

“You guys just wait till Thanksgiving!” Jamie crowed. “I’ll bring back an entire turkey!”

I rolled my eyes. “*If* it can fit.”

 We returned to the same highway where we had such success with Jamie’s cat. Deb was just reaching for a baby armadillo when a cop car drove by.

“Hey you darn brats, what the heck are you doing with that dead animal?” shouted a policeman. Only the officer used different words than ‘darn,’ ‘brats,’ and ‘heck.’ “Don’t you know there’s freaking germs in that stuff?”

While every sentence the policeman said was *technically* a question, it seemed like they merited an exclamation point. And he clearly didn’t want any actual response from us. 

The angry cop veered away. Deb had kept calm through the whole altercation. Jamie and I were upset at how we’d been treated, but kept our mouths shut. But Clay and Arnold were both deathly rattled. The swearing policeman scared them worse than any of our teachers’ previous threats of detention.

We only needed that one bad incident to convince us to start hunting salvagables in more rural spaces.

Like I said, these country roads twisted and turned something bad. It was near impossible to predict when someone’s car would come rounding the bend. On the plus side, the trees were thick. If someone drove by, we’d instantly flee, hiding in the woods till the coast was clear.

The only other problem was we couldn’t get to the countryside by walking. So, we biked.

It was a perfect moment of a perfectly fine day when I walked into the middle of a two-lane road to collect a dead dog.

From the remains, I figured it was one of those little cuddly things. Maybe in life it had been a sweet pug. Under its crushed skull, it still had a collar, with a number to call. The owner probably had no idea what had befallen their dear lost companion.

I meant to hand it off to Deb, who had her backpack open. But I was taking more time than I should have. See, I was too wrapped up in a minor heroic fantasy.

“No, I don’t want any money for making your reunion possible,” I would say to the owner. “The joy on both your faces is enough for me!”

Headlights burned into the back of my head. The big truck swerved early enough to save me. But with that sharp curve…the vehicle crashed into a solid wall of evergreens.

“You know, that car looks like the one my Daddy drives,” Deb seemingly went into shock while the rest of us panicked. She raced over, peeking into the car’s shattered windshield. The air bag had failed to deploy.

“It *is* my Daddy!” Her voice turned even more high-pitched than usual. A pained screech.

At the time, cellphones existed, but they looked like bricks and only business people owned them. So as a mob, we hightailed it out of there on our bikes. In an absolute turnabout, we willingly went searching for the police.

 Deb stayed behind, to check if her father still had a pulse. “It really doesn’t look that bad, Daddy!” she said to the unconscious—or worse—adult.

 When we reached the nearest home with a phone, that of Clay’s grandmother, we called in the incident. Anonymously, though we didn’t know the word at the time.

Arnold led me, Jamie, and Clay in the race back to the scene of the accident. To see if we could do anything else to help our friend and her father.

But by the time we got there, an ambulance and several cop cars were present. They had a band of blowing horns playing to a flashing red light show. Either side of street had blockades set up, with signs saying to turn back.

Relief washed through our group. We couldn’t see Deb in the crowd, but Arnold recognized the cop who had cussed us out. The four of us silently turned around our bikes. We rode straight to our homes.

In time, each of us had our parents come into our rooms and tell us about Deb and her father going to the hospital. When it happened to me, I feigned surprise.

My mom fussed about me seeing someone or something called a “therapist.” I didn’t know what that was at the time, but to my young ears it sounded ominous. I learned soon enough.

The club had all agreed beforehand to play dumb, giving away no clue that we’d been near the crash. And in my case, that I’d *caused* it.

For two days, we heard nothing from Deb. In that time, none of us went out to play. To enjoy the brief slice of August we had before school started up again. It was like we had all independently put ourselves into our own personal time-outs, and we deserved it. Especially me.

After those couple days, only Clay still wanted to visit the mansion. “What if the magic only lasts a set amount of time? It might run out of energy. Each thing we bring back might be the last. So let’s make it count! I know a kid whose old hamster’s been sick a long while, and finally died today. We can help them!”

The rest of us felt no enthusiasm. Fear gnawed at us that, to add to the tragedy of someone already getting hurt, we’d also get in trouble. We discussed the possibility of juvie. Only Jamie seemed fine with it.

Arnold was first to take Clay’s side. My old best friend had neglected to mention he’d gotten a call from Deb.

I sighed. It was best to keep away from our parents. At any time, they might discover what really happened. Our complicity. The terrible truth was just a phone call away. Only Arnold was certain Deb wouldn’t rat us out.

So, for varied reasons, we accompanied Clay on his task fetching the hamster. As normal, we separated when it came time to entering the haunted woods.

The mansion had been meant as our clubhouse. A place of sanctuary against heat, bullies, and chores. Now, I could only glare at the place.

To the surprise of everyone but Arnold, Deb was there. She looked like she hadn’t slept for days. But she was smiling a lot.

She wore her backpack, which looked heavy with something. Arnold offered to help her carry it. She waved him away and recounted what had happened to her family in the last few days.

“Yeah, we had an ambulance ride, with this real loud siren that hurt my ears! At the hospital, my Mommy was waiting. The doctors did the best they could, but said Daddy wasn’t going to make it. He’d been hurt too bad by his own truck.”

“Deb, I’m so sorry,” I said.

“It’s OK, Ben.” Deb kept grinning. “Mommy was crying in her wad of tissues, and that got me crying, too. But it made it so I could sneak away from her, and find one of those skinny knives the green-shirt doctors use. And it was real sharp! I cut myself a little.”

Deb showed us her finger, which had a band-aid wrapped around it. “Sharper than any scissors I’ve owned. See, I knew the dumbwaiter’s size meant I couldn’t bring *all* of him…” She teared up as she smiled. “So…I had to choose the most important part.”

“What’s in that backpack, Deb?” asked Arnold. While he wore a crew cut, the little bit of hair he had on his head stood up.

“Please tell me those red stains are just ketchup,” I begged.

 Clay dropped the hamster he’d been carrying.

  Jamie smiled. “Well, let’s go up and see what we can do!”

 It took all five of us to tug the rope. Whatever supernatural force existed upstairs, it had always proved reliable. For each turn taken, we’d leave the subject alone for a couple minutes before bringing everything down.

We guys felt perfectly fine about leaving the current package up there forever. But, no. The girls pulled the left rope. Deb rushed to unseal the door.

For the first time since discovering the dumbwaiter’s magic, I wished it wouldn’t work. My wish failed to come true.

 Deb cheered, and tried to hold Arnold’s hand. He pulled away.

“I don’t know what he’s saying.” Clay’s hands covered his mouth as he spoke.

“Well of course you can’t,” said Jamie. “Deb’s dad may have a tongue, but without lungs, there’s no way for him to make sounds.”

“But he still has ears.” Deb dried her tears. “So he can hear me say ‘I love you, Daddy.’ Forever and ever.” And she kissed the top of the severed head that we had returned to life.

“Wait,” I said, with a shaking voice, “…I can tell what he’s trying to do with his mouth. He’s screaming."
