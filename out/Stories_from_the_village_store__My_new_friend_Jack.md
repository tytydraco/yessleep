How are you. Sorry for screwing up so much with the cliffhanger at the end of the [previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/ASxOJnUSga) I just wanted to have a little fun, I guess.

Anyway, let's continue:

As I said, the night Robert visited me, around two in the morning, a skeleton arrived in the store. He approached walking slowly while I looked at him in surprise. The figure was not three and a half meters as Roberto said, it was two, he was not covered in fire and he did not have a machete.

The thing entered the store and greeted me, its voice calm and a little hoarse.

"Hello mate". He said, very casually.

"Um, hello?" I asked, a little scared. It seems that the figure noticed and said:

"Don't be scared. I won't do anything to you."

"How do I know that's true?" I questioned.

"Well, simply because I don't come armed or anything and, furthermore, I come in a good manner." Well yeah, it didn't sound that bad.

"A guy came three hours ago saying that he came from the year 1964 and that at that time a giant skeleton murdered him and, mysteriously, he woke up in our time." I explained.

"Oh I see". He said, thoughtful. "What was the man's name?"

"Robert." I replied.

"Ahh yeah haha, I remember him. Was he wearing a hat?" He asked, relaxed.

"Yes, and he was dressed in a suit."

"Well the thing is, I murdered him." He said darkly.

"B-but why?" I answered shakily.

"Well, I was created to kill not very good people, so to speak." He said, a little more relaxed.

"Who created you?"

"You will know him when you die." He replied, returning to that somber tone.

"Well, that's strange. Is that saying that Robert was a bad person or something?"

"Mm, I think he was a drug dealer, I killed him for that."

"And why did he come to our store today, safe and sound, sixty years later?" I asked him, thoughtful.

"Not the slightest idea, friend. Strange things happen around here... But I shouldn't let him loose, I'll look for him. Did he tell you where he was going?" Asked.

"Nope."

"Good. Still, it won't take long to find him, he couldn't have gone far." The skeleton said, thinking.

"Me... Will you kill me?" I inquired, uneasy.

"Haha, I could." The thing laughed. "But you seem like a good guy, and I wasn't created to kill good people so... Nah."

"Well... Thanks buddy, I guess." Finally, I was able to relax a little.

"Do you want to ask me something else?"

"Yes what is your name?"

"Jack". Answered.

And that's how I became friends with Jack. We talked for two hours about normal things like: What music, movies, series, books, video games, food and drinks that we like, what we think of such things and so on.

Jack likes heavy metal and jazz, he plays guitar, bass, piano and saxophone. He likes horror movies, books, series and video games, he likes junk food, smoking and drinking alcohol. He can control people and reanimate corpses. Additionally, he can change height and when he gets angry or is about to kill, his skeleton is covered in fire. He can also teleport and has the power of telekinesis.

Jack says that it was created by his former boss (currently dead) four thousand years ago who is on another existential plane with the objective of killing bad people, both on said plane and here. He didn't tell me much about that place, or practically anything.

I asked him what had happened to his boss and he told me that someone killed him and that person is the one who is now ruling that world.

We also talk about the damn town, the woods, the store, and the weird things that happen around here.

Before Jack left around four o'clock, he said that something bad is about to happen to humanity. Something terrible. I asked him what he meant but he didn't want to tell me.

"Well friend, I will visit you again soon. Thank you for your attention." He said and finally, he left.

Do you remember Emilia, my night shift colleague who was not present that night because she was sick? I told him what happened and he didn't believe me until I showed him the camera footage from the night before and he was shocked. She said that when she was little, her grandmother, before she died, told her that a strange skeleton was walking around the world killing bad people.

Jack continued to visit us almost every night in his skeleton or in different people's bodies to chat and buy something. I kept asking him what he meant by that bad thing that's coming but he didn't want to tell me yet.

I'll leave the post here, guys. I hope you liked it. Thank you for your support, I will keep you posted. Greetings and good night.
