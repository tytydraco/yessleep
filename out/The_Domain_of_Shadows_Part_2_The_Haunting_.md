[Part 1:](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/toc7nlV8nY) 

Ethan stood frozen, staring at the door. The knock had been soft but deliberate and served to break an oppressive silence in his room.

"Who's there?" he called out, his voice cracking.

No answer.

He stood, his legs trembling, and strode to the door. His hand wavered on the doorknob. It was late, and his apartment was supposed to be empty. Slowly, he turned the knob and yanked the door open.

The hall was dark, devoid of life. A streetlamp somewhere outside the house cast a few stretched silhouettes of trees against the walls, but no person was to be seen. Ethan stepped out into the hall and peered into the corners.

A cold wind whizzed past him, sending a chill running down his spine. The door of his room banged shut.

"Dammit!" he cursed, spinning around. He ran back to the door, but when he reached for the knob to turn it, it would not budge.

From the other side of the door came a low, guttural whisper, barely perceptible, yet unmistakable. Sounded like his name.

"EEeeethan…"

Ethan's heart pounded in his ears. "This isn't funny!" he yelled, banging on the door.

The whisper turned into a guttural, distorted laugh. Then, silence.

The hall lights began to stutter and hum until they drove him into pitch-black darkness. Ethan fumbled for his phone, sending a flashlight through the heavy void. As the circle of light arced through the hall, it finally came to rest on something which dropped his stomach.

Pacing at the far end of the hall stood something. It was gigantic, humanoid, with unnaturally long limbs. The head had tilted at a completely impossible angle. Its eyes smoldered, like smoldering embers in the dark.

Ethan's breath caught. The figure just stood there, but then the air surrounding it seemed to ripple in waves, almost as if reality distorted.

The flash flickered and, in the momentary sweep of darkness that followed, was gone.

Ethan spun around, his heart racing. He sprinted to the front door, only to find it locked. No matter how hard he twisted and pulled, it wouldn't budge.

Behind him, the distorted whisper returned, closer this time.

"Eeeethan… why did you call us?"

He turned, shining the flashlight around the room. Shadows danced on the walls, moving independently of the light.

"Stay away from me!" he shouted, backing into the corner.

His phone suddenly beeped and flashed a screen notification. The website was answering.

"Do you want the Shadows to leave? Answer now."

There was a box below it, two possible answers: YES or NO.

The hands of Ethan shook as his fingers tapped onto YES. The screen glowed for about a second and showed the next message.

"You invited us. Now, you must complete the ritual."

"What ritual?!" Ethan screamed at the screen, his voice cracking.

The lights flickered back on, and his room was different. Lining the walls were weird symbols, scrawled in what looked to be black ink. His desk and bed were gone, replaced by a lone chair in the center of the room.

Sitting on the chair was a little, antique box with intricate carvings.

The website refreshed once again:

"Open the box to continue. But beware: once opened, there is no turning back."

Ethan paused, looking at the box. He felt this weird tugging sensation toward it, as if some invisible hands were helping him along. He found himself moving toward it against his better judgment.

With every step, the air grew heavier, weighing down on his chest. His ears rang once more with the same whispers, this time louder, then turning into a cacophony of voices.

He reached out, fingers trembling, and opened the lid of the box.

It was a bright flash of light emanating from inside, and then the room dissolved around him.

The last thing Ethan saw before it all went black was the figure from the hall again, this time standing inches away, its twisted face contorted into some sort of grotesque smile.

Then there was the sound of laughter, echoing through the void.
