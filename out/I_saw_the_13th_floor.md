The elevator in my building skips the 13th floor.

Everyone knows that.

The buttons jump from 12 straight to 14. Management says it’s to avoid “unnecessary discomfort,” which sounds ridiculous until you realize no one wants to live on a floor numbered after bad luck. Over time, it becomes normal. You stop thinking about it. You stop questioning why it was done in the first place.

I hadn’t thought about it at all till last night.

It was just after midnight when I stepped into the elevator alone. I was tired and distracted, half-scrolling through my phone while the doors slid shut behind me. The familiar ding echoed softly, and the elevator settled into its usual quiet hum. The air inside felt stale, like it always did this late at night.

I realized I hadn’t pressed my floor yet.

I lifted my hand toward the panel-

And the elevator started moving.

I froze, staring at the buttons. None of them were lit. I told myself someone else must have called it from another floor, or that the system was glitching. Old buildings do that. I tried to stay calm, even though something about it felt wrong.

Then it stopped.

Not suddenly. Not violently. It slowed and came to rest as if it had arrived exactly where it was supposed to be. The hum of the motor faded, leaving an uncomfortable silence behind. My own breathing sounded too loud in the small space.

The floor display flickered.

It went dark.

Then a number appeared.

13. 

My stomach dropped.

The doors didn’t open.

But the lights outside the elevator turned on.

Through the narrow seam between the doors, I could see a hallway. Long and dimly lit. The carpet looked worn down to threads, and the walls were yellowed, stained with age. Dust hung in the air, visible even from where I stood, unmoving.

It didn’t look like part of my building.

It looked forgotten.

I took a step back just as a soft knocking began from the other side of the doors.

Slow. Careful. Almost polite.

Knock.
Pause.
Knock.

My heart was racing. I didn’t speak. I didn’t move. I just stared at the crack between the doors, half-expecting it to widen on its own, half-expecting a hand to appear.

Then a voice spoke.

Calm. Close.

“You forgot to press the button for your floor.”

I swallowed hard. “I was about to,” I said, my voice barely steady.

There was a long pause.

The display flickered again.

The elevator started moving.

The knocking stopped immediately. The hallway lights outside shut off as the elevator rose, the numbers changing quickly-14, 15, 16-until it finally slowed and stopped at 18.

The doors opened.

Everything looked normal.

My floor was bright, clean, and familiar. I stepped out quickly, not looking back as the elevator doors slid shut behind me. I walked down the hallway, my footsteps echoing louder than usual, trying to convince myself it had all been a malfunction, a coincidence layered on exhaustion.

That’s when I saw my apartment door.

It was already open.

Just a few inches.
