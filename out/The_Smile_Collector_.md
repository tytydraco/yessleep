The peeling wallpaper in my tiny apartment mocks me with its faded floral pattern. It's never been much, this place on the wrong side of town, but it's always felt like a haven. Until a week ago.

It started subtly, a whisper in the symphony of creaks and groans my old building constantly plays. A single, chipped porcelain doll tucked discreetly behind a picture frame on my bookshelf. I don't own dolls. Never have. This one, with its wide, unnervingly perfect smile painted on its cracked face and eyes that seemed to follow me around the room even with their glassy lack of focus, sent a shiver down my spine.

I tossed it in the trash, the cold porcelain feeling oddly clammy in my hands, a prickle of unease settling in my gut. The next morning, the trash bag was ripped open, the doll lying on the floor outside my door like a grotesque porcelain sentinel. Panic, cold and sharp, clawed at my throat. This wasn't a discarded toy.

The police, when I called, scoffed. A prank, they said. Teenagers with nothing better to do. But pranksters don't leave creepy porcelain dolls on doorsteps, especially not with a note scrawled in messy handwriting: "Thank you for the donation." The words felt like a twisted taunt, a promise of something more sinister to come.

The dolls became an unwelcome fixture in my life. One wedged between the couch cushions, another hanging from the showerhead, dripping water and sporting that same chilling smile. With each new appearance, the notes grew more cryptic: "He likes them all," one read, followed by "Soon, your collection will be complete." The pronouns bothered me the most. Who was "he"? And what did he want with a collection of unsettling dolls?

Sleep became a luxury I couldn't afford. Every creak of the floorboards, every gust of wind against the window, sent my heart into overdrive. I started keeping a baseball bat by the bed, a pathetic defense against whatever lurked in the shadows.

Tonight, things are different. A knock on the door, curt and insistent. My breath catches in my throat. I don't move.  Through the peephole, a sliver of dim light reveals a figure shrouded in shadow. Then, a voice, raspy and low, sends shivers down my spine: "Just one more smile. For the collection."

The words hang heavy in the stale air of my apartment. I can't stay here. But where can I go? The bathroom. It's small, the only lock a flimsy one, but it's something. I barricade the door with the rickety towel rack, the flimsy wood offering a small comfort against the unknown threat.

My phone clutched in my sweaty hand, the screen a lifeline to the outside world, the outside world that seems so far away. I'm alone, trapped with the echoes of my own ragged breaths and the chilling whisper of a collector seeking his final prize.  Is this a twisted game? Or is something far more sinister at work?

I have no answers, only a bone-deep terror and the image of a wide, unnatural smile burned into my memory. Someone, or something, wants my smile. And if I don't find help, it might just take it.
