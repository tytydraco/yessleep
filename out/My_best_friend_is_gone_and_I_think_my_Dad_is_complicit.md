I remember once, when I was about 8 or 9, I was watching the movie *Robots* with a close family friend of mine. 

Alex looked over at me, and back to the screen. I’d never seen the movie, but Alex had and was excited to show a particular part somewhere, maybe, 15 minutes into the film. So, he fast-forwarded through the start of the movie, and I gathered what I could of the story. I didn’t have a clue what was going on.

I’ve known Alex.. pretty much all my life. I trusted him with everything and always listened intently to what he had to offer, so when he said, “I gotta show you something, it’s really cool!” I didn’t have much reason to question what.

He was younger than me by a couple of weeks, but I always considered him a “big” brother, in the way he introduced me to so many new things. Games, movies, and some strange yet intriguing YouTube videos. 

He was also the person who introduced me to live leak, but this was much later. A story for another time.

This exploration into the media was the basis of our relationship, and he loved finding new things. He was quite good at it.

I remember… I was waiting on Alex, waiting on this “really cool thing”.

“It’s right about here. This is when it happens,” Alex states. He pauses the section, and presses play. Now, I don’t remember what the scene was, or what was actually happening. I just remember watching the colourful robots on screen, having a conversation. 

Suddenly, and with little warning, I noticed a light stream of pins and needles rushing through the tips of my fingers, and slowly creeping up my palms, through my wrist and up my forearms - A sensation that left me feeling a mix of discomfort and excitement. There was an uneasiness swirling around my skull, and the butterflies in my stomach, which at that point were fast asleep, began to wake, then flutter, then shake. Soon they were making their way upward. They crawled their way into my ribcage, navigating between my pair of rapidly inflating lungs and through to my heart. Soon their light wings began to beat faster, and faster, and faster.

Alex looked over to me again. I barely noticed his expecting gaze from the corner of mine, and gradually he disappeared as haziness tunnelled my vision. 

My breathing started to outlast me, and not too soon after, I heard Alex say, very shakily, “Do you feel it? Can you feel the-”

***

And I slowly awoke.

I remember… waking up, drenched in sweat, but my skin freezing from the breeze of the ceiling fan. My body ached, teeth chattered, and to my left was an acidic spillage that, I couldn’t recall when, had ejected itself from my stomach. Credits rolled up the TV screen, and the music sang from the speakers.

I peeled myself from the dusty carpet of Alex’s living room, wiped away the remainder of the vomit from my mouth, and turned my head to my best friend.

He was curled up, leaning against the lounge from the floor. He too was soaked, eyes bloodshot, and actively trying to concentrate on his breathing. For a few moments, the air was electric, like someone had thrown the room through a whirlwind, and left us to pick up the pieces. Before I could mutter his name, Alex looked at me. I watch as a smirk etches its way across his mouth like a crack in thin ice.

Alex lets out a tired giggle and says, “I threw up the first time too.”

***

This is the first time I’ve thought about that day in quite a while. It’s one of those things you start to believe never really happened in the first place, like it was a false memory…

I turned 21 about a week and a half ago. On the day of my birthday, Alex had sent me a card. At this point, Alex and I weren’t so much best friends as we were… Kinda friends, I guess. Over the years we had drifted apart. Formed new groups, got girlfriends, moved away and eventually our relationship became… almost non-existent. So, the last thing I expected was a card from an old friend.

I feel it's important to add this part in. The contents of the card are as follows, as strange as it seems.

He writes:

*Michael,*

*I’m trying my best to keep this all together, but I’m* *~~finding it difficult~~* *struggling to find the words. I feel like I’m going crazy, and I don’t know if what I’ve seen is real, or whether it's just something I made up. I don’t know what to think. Fuck, I’m really sorry, I don’t have time to get another card.*

*You need to get out. You are old enough now to leave, you can GO.* *~~Please, don’t go~~* *Please, Michael. Leave while you can, and just get as far away as possible. You can do that. For me.*

*I’m sorry, I can’t see you, but I don’t think you should see me right now. Just when you can, get in your car and go. And just* *~~STAY AWAY FROM.~~* *?????*

*Just go.*

*Love you brother.*

*Alex*

When I first read the card, I laughed. What the fuck is this chicken scratch? Must have been some weird inside joke I’d forgotten. Momentarily after reading, I wanted to text Alex, saying something witty and playful, like “Did you wipe your ass with this card?” or something like that. 

But, when I looked for our last conversation in messenger, it was missing. In fact, Alex’s whole Facebook profile was missing. And his Instagram. His Snapchat.  Even his LinkedIn profile had vanished.

I texted his number with the same sort of message with the added, “Also, are you going off the grid or something,” to which the message then bounced back. Unseen.

The only real evidence I had at the time of Alex’s existence was this stupid card written by a mad man. Confusing, unspecific, the absolute unintelligible ramblings of a delusional individual. It sounded nothing like Alex, and yet…. I had to believe it was him.

After a few days, I left it alone. I didn’t forget about it, but I didn’t have much to go off either.

The next piece of evidence I found, or handed to me, I guess, was today. 

My Dad woke me up with an air of unbridled emotion. I knew he had been crying, but for how long I was unsure. I don’t think he slept. He sat down at the end of my bed, something he had done many times before, but this time it was... Difficult. I adjusted myself - sliding up to the bed head. I tried my best to seem awake, while rubbing the shit out of my crusty eyes. 

Dad cleared his throat and swallowed the remainder of his mournful lump, and whispered, “Michael, I’m really sorry…” 

He told me a fairly true, but filtered story. He didn’t want to disturb me with every detail, but that didn’t stop me from discovering the rest. Group chats I'd been in for years started to flood with messages from people I hadn’t spoken to since then.

All of them about our school friend Alex.

Throughout the day, more details were sent in. Then more. And at about 4pm today, I had a grasp of the whole story. A story that seemed to unravel like bandages from a festering wound.

Alex was found at 6.30 this morning-

-hanging from a tree in front of his own house. 

It’s hard to know for sure, but from the information gathered, Alex had climbed the old maple, strung himself up on the thickest branch wearing nothing but a pair of pyjama pants, and leapt. He (everyone hopes) died instantly. The sheer weight of his own body plummeting just a few feet downward had whipped his spinal cord into two pieces. 

Alex was only 20 years old. In a week, he’d be 21.

***

I’m struggling to find the words. I feel weird. It’s been a few hours since I was told of Alex’s passing, and yet, I cannot find the tears to mourn him. I feel guilty, but I've been thinking a lot about the letter. I keep glancing over to it, and bringing myself back to this screen. Trying to just… figure things out, I guess?

I don’t know why he did what he did. I guess the police will do their investigation or whatever. But then what? It feels like Alex tried his absolute best to wipe every single trace of himself off earth. The only things he left behind were our memories together, and this card.

That memory. That memory, man, I can feel it gnawing at me again.

'Robots'? I feel like such a sick freak trying to connect 'Robots' to this card - to Alex’s death.

I don’t know what to do next. I’m hoping someone could give me some advice?

I’m not sure where to go from here. 

I need some help. I’m going to go mad dwelling on this whole thing.

I need to get some water.

I just got a message from Alex’s girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend now, I suppose. Fuck that’s morbid. 

At least,  I think it’s her. I don’t have the number listed.

"It’s Jess. Alex’s girlfriend. I need to talk to you. ASAP."

It’s quick and to the point. But is it her?

"For Alex"

I’m shaking so much right now I’m not sure what to do.

… I can feel the butterflies waking up...

I’m going to respond.

I start to workshop a concise text back, one that captures interest but not desperation. 

I then receive an image. From the small thumbnail, I can’t really make out what it is. 

I click on it, and struggle to clarify what I’m seeing. 

A baby picture. Polaroid. It's set up way too formally. It's Alex. He doesn’t look any older than 5. He looks… Confused. Like he’s been caught off guard, standing with his arms by his side dressed in a Thomas the Tank engine shirt. 
It isn’t a photo I’m familiar with, but the room… the room where it was taken is all too familiar.

"He sent me this just before he…"

What the fuck? I zoom into the image.

… The butterflies are flying...

That’s my old bathroom. The paintings are all the same, as well as that weird stain on the marble sink.

Then I get sent another image. Same bathroom. Same Alex. Different lighting and clothes.

Then another.

and another.

and another.

Until I had a collection of various versions of the same image. Same Alex.

I look even closer. I investigate every inch of the frame of every photo. Then I see… 

… The butterflies are trying to get lose….

In the mirror… I see… just in the corner of the reflection… I think I see...

I receive one more message. This one supporting my fears.

Jess, who is very much a stranger to me, who I’ve never even met, asks a relatively simple question:

"Tell me if I’m wrong, but is that your dad?"

...The butterflies have made their way on to my carpet...
