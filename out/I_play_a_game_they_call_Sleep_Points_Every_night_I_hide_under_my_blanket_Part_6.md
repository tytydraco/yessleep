I didn’t quite understand why it was so important that we meet in person. Let alone in private. I guess people would’ve thought we were both mentally unstable if they overheard us. Or maybe the thing in the clock didn’t like other people not involved to know about it. If that was the case, then I had probably royally fucked up by telling Truman and Ezra about what was going on. But nevertheless, I was just glad to finally have someone else who knew something.  As absolutely ecstatic as I was to have the opportunity to sneak into a cute girl’s house in the middle of the night without her parents knowing, even beyond that, just the fact that I’d finally have someone, anyone, regardless of who or where or when it was, who could finally give me the help I needed was a total lifesaver.

I only wished it could’ve been that night. It was still Thursday night. So, if this week was gonna play out anything like last week, I’d still have to duck and cover at midnight tonight. But since the night after that, the night Anastasia told me to meet up at her place, was gonna be a Friday night, hopefully that meant I didn’t have anything to worry about. On Friday night of last week, nothing happened with the clock. Maybe it was only going to check in on me on weeknights. It must take weekends off. That was probably why Anastasia had told me to come Friday night. 

I didn’t have too much time to think about the clock and the app, though. So, I figured I’d take a break from trying to figure out the seemingly deadly mysteries that had been running my life for the past week and a half. I had no reason to speculate anymore. I was finally about to talk to someone who knew what the hell was going on. Who knew what she was talking about.

Since the project in environmental science wasn’t due until March the 4th, two Mondays from then, I decided to not worry about it too much when I got home. Maybe I’d do a little bit of work on it over the weekend. But even then, I’d still have another week left after the weekend was over. So I just did my usual homework. Only the amount that would be due the next day. Which wasn’t really that much anyway. I knocked that out in about 45 minutes. I went on my phone some, but since its battery was still draining so fast, after another 45 minutes, I figured I’d just spend the rest of my day waiting for it to charge back up again. 

I was still a bit sensitive about my new ill-gotten Kingdom Hearts game, so I just found other Switch games to try out and spent the rest of my night on that. But I still ended up breaking down and playing it anyway, eventually. Like I said, since they’d already spent money on it, the least I could do is get some use out of it. Even if I didn’t deserve it. Better than letting it go to waste if I had no intention of setting the record straight about all the times I was on my phone while I was grounded and wasn’t supposed to be on it. And let’s face it, I obviously wasn’t gonna do that. And I knew that.

Then before I knew it, dinner came and went and next thing I knew it was 9:30. Looking at the clocks glowing and increasingly red face, I could tell it was time once again for the nightly ordeal. But at least this time, I could endure it with the knowledge that I was about to have this shit figured out. At least this was the last time I’d have to deal with this crap before learning some tips and tricks as to how I was gonna deal with this thing. Maybe even how to be rid of it, once and for all.

That midnight, when the monster came out, I was able to stay totally still in the knowledge that maybe this would be the last time I’d ever have to deal with this thing. Maybe, after my meeting with Anastasia, I’d never have to live through this again. When the monster came out, I almost felt kinda bad for it. Since I just knew I was about to give it a run for its money the next time it tried to come for me.

On Friday morning, I had gotten a decent amount of sleep. The confidence that I’d received from Anastasia’s note had let me go to sleep with a lot less fear and anxiety about the future than what I’d been dealing with up to that point. Still didn’t feel great about the new game. But it had already been 4 days since I’d gotten it. My parents already put down the money. Maybe they could get some portion of their money back, but at that point, I figured it would be better to repay them by enjoying their gift than through what, half their money back? They’d still be missing the other half. There’d still be another maybe 25 or 30 bucks down the drain even if I did fess up. It didn’t feel great, but I figured hanging onto the game was my best option, given what I could do.

When I got to my locker in between third and fourth period, I saw Truman coming nearby. But apparently he was in no mood to give me any more trouble. I heard him talk to his friends about how he’d fucked up by breaking up with Anastasia. How he tried getting back together with her. But that she wasn’t budging. It was so weird to see the person being broken up with move on so easily and the person who did the breaking up look so crushed by his own actions. But then, I had always kinda figured that Truman wasn’t exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and never really thought things through all the way anyhow. So, this wasn’t so out of the ordinary for him.

By the time 6th period had rolled around again, Anastasia and I, along with the rest of our class, walked down to the library again after Mr. Brigham showed us another brief power point about how to set up the poster and gave some more additional information about how to go about researching food chains and all about how to go about researching really just any academic topic in general since we were gonna need to know about that in college. 

“Aren’t we already in College?” one of the students joked. You always hear that one at College High.

Anastasia, just like the day before, got right to work. I skimmed through a few websites myself, just writing down anything that seemed relevant to the topic. After about 10 or 15 minutes or so, she asked me what all I had written down. It was pretty scant compared to the detailed, fully fleshed out sheets of notes she had managed to put together in that time. But she didn’t seem too concerned about the fact that I hadn’t put in nearly the same amount of effort that she had. 

I still felt kinda bad. At first, I was worried that I was gonna be the guy who had to do all the work. That whoever I got stuck with was gonna barely try and make me do everything. But now here I was. Being the exact guy that I, myself, was dreading to get paired up with. And Anastasia didn’t even seem to care. She was handling my uselessness with so much more patience and understanding than I ever would have. She wasn’t complaining nearly as much as what I would’ve done. Even after the exchange we had at the end of class the day before, she was going about her work and interactions with me like none of that had ever happened. I started to question whether or not that interaction really did take place. 

To reassure myself that it had, I checked inside my backpack. Did I still have the loose leaf piece of paper that she had torn out for me? I remembered just kinda haphazardly jamming it in there after she gave it to me since I was so worried about making it to 7th period on time. If it was still there, then I’d know for a fact that what I thought happened yesterday truly had taken place. But I still had a tough time believing that it actually did. A cute girl, inviting me to her house in the middle of the night to give me information that could literally save my life? Information that I was beginning to be certain I could never find from anyone at all? It all just felt too good to be true.

While she was jotting away still, I unzipped my backpack and desperately tried to search for her note. My hand felt a loose-leaf sheet of paper. I looked at it. It was exactly as I had remembered it: Her address and a message saying to meet her there at 2:05 AM the next morning. Come to think about it, 2:05 seemed like an oddly specific time. Why not just 2 AM? Why 5 minutes later?

I didn’t want to arouse Anastasia’s attention with what I was doing, but it didn’t end up mattering. Before I could think too seriously about the time of night at which she told me to show up, she was already beginning to bring up our meeting.

“Before our time together concludes, how do you intend to reach me?” she had asked very shortly after I pulled her note out of my backpack. At first it struck me as a bit of an odd question since we still had 20 minutes of class left, and I wasn’t expecting to have to work with her after school or anything since I figured we’d only be working together during class.

“What do you mean? You mean, like, about the project?”, I asked.

“Our project, as it pertains to our Environmental Science class, will most likely not require any additional work outside of class time. Mr. Brigham himself has already stated as such. Not even to construct our poster. He has said he will be personally providing us with poster board such that our parents or guardians will not have to spend money on such supplies.” She then started to lower her voice to a half-whisper. “The project I am referring to is instead regarding Sleep Points.”, she concluded.

“What’s Sleep Points?” I asked a bit dully. I didn’t want it to look like I thought she was talking about what I thought she was talking about. At the time, I didn't have a name for the game I was playing.  I didn't wanna assume that that was what she meant.  So I was trying to play dumb. Looking back, that was pretty stupid. By that point, I had already confirmed that the slip of paper she gave me was real. By then, what was there for me to be afraid of? I guess that’s just the type of stupid shit ya just end up doing around your crush.

“Do you recall mentioning a post-it note to me yesterday? One containing a seemingly random inscription?”, she asked, almost a bit shakily, not sure if she should be asking me about it.

“Yeah, I remember. Why?” I asked, now convinced this had to be about the app and the clock and everything that was going on lately that I didn’t understand.

“Well, now, you didn’t happen to research what was written on the note any further, did you? Because if you had simply let that note in the desk be, you don’t have to worry about that paper I gave you yesterday.” She said, I suppose hoping that I hadn’t interacted with it in the way that she was clearly worried that I had. But unfortunately for her, that was exactly what I had done.

“I typed the text into google. I wanted to see what it meant.” I said, as Anastasia looked as though she was about to have either a heart-attack, or a stroke, or some kind of lethal combination of both. The color in her face looked as though it drained completely.

“Yes”, she said, then taking a deep breath. “I presume you came across a certain cell-phone application. Its name, of course, being the same random string of characters that you saw on the note, correct?” she asked.

“Uh, yeah. Why?” I asked in response.

“Well, since its true name is so unwieldly, I have taken to referring to that certain application as ‘Sleep Points’.” She explained. “Other people have other names for it. But ‘Sleep Points’ is the one I typically prefer.” She concluded.

“Oh. So that’s ‘Sleep Points’.” I responded. Apparently, it wasn’t even just the two of us either. Other people were playing too.

“And you downloaded the application, did you not?” She asked, very obviously knowing the answer to that question.

“Well, yeah”, I responded, weakly.

Anastasia took a moment to jot something else down. Then she shot a hand up. It took a moment for Mr. Brigham to see that she had had her hand up, but eventually he noticed and asked her what was up.

“May I please be excused to the restroom?” She asked. Mr. Brigham agreed. I looked at what she had written down right before she asked to go to the bathroom. “Staircase. Front entrance. Meet me.” it said.

I knew I couldn’t just immediately ask to be excused right after Anastasia did. I tried to wait it out a little while to try and not make it look suspicious. Maybe I could come up with a different excuse. That would probably be more believable. But time was running out. I had to meet up with her soon. So eventually, I just broke down and walked over to Mr. Brigham and asked to use the bathroom too. I just hoped Mr. Brigham wouldn’t think much of it. Given that it had taken him awhile to even notice that Anastasia had had her hand up though, I was liking my odds. And sure enough, he let me leave.

It took a couple of minutes to make my way to the staircase nearby the school’s front entrance, but when I got there, Anastasia jumped right into our discussion about Sleep Points.

“Do not try to reach out to me on your phone. Have you noticed your phone’s battery draining exceptionally quickly as of late?”, she questioned.

“Yeah”, I said.

“Don’t risk draining its battery entirely on a cell phone call. Don’t let it die.” She said with a pretty intense degree of seriousness.

“This brings me back to my original question: How do you intend to reach me?” She asked once again.

“Well do you have any social media accounts? If not, you could always set one up. And then I could just call you on Facebook or Discord or something. I can still do that from my laptop. Seems a lot easier than showing up to your place in the middle of the night.” I said.

“My home internet connection does not sustain calls on such platforms.” She explained.

“Well, then why don’t I just private message you instead? I can do that from my laptop too” I said.

“Others could see the messages.  Do not let that happen.” This, along with everything else we were saying to one another, was all still being said in a very hushed tone of voice. Even though we were standing in a totally empty stairwell. Something about this Sleep Points game made it dangerous for other people to hear or know about it. Or at least if they weren’t already playing.

“I could still delete the messages.” I said.

“And what if you forget? Or, better yet, what if you were to become complacent and start telling yourself that you do not truly need to delete every last message about our discussion?  One message. One mistake. That’s all it takes. No one can know about the Sandman."  

Just then, a chill went up my spine.  I saw it again.  The same face that I saw in the clock's face as it would approach midnight.  The same hateful and haunting glare, right out of the corner of my eye.  Although, for some reason, I could still see the hands and numbers of a clock over its face.  At first I chalked it up to a hallucination.  Or at least I wanted to.  But by then, I knew better than to rationalize away things like that.  What I saw had to mean something.  

But how could the monster, this "Sandman" creature, be in the stairwell with us right then and there?  It wasn't midnight.  It was supposed to be safely contained within our clocks.  It just wasn't adding up.  Anastasia glanced over to the side, in exactly the same direction where I had seen this so-called "Sandman".  She must've seen it too.

"Listen. Just be at my house. 5 after 2 in the morning.” She insisted. “How will you get there?” She repeated yet again. 

I hadn’t really thought about how I was going to arrive at Anastasia’s house. I was so caught up in the thrill of it all that I hadn’t taken the time to think through the logistics. Or at least not until our conversation had started. That was why, even though I was so excited about the idea before, I had wanted to find other, more convenient ways of linking up once she started pressing me on the issue. But once it became clear that Anastasia was dead serious about me coming over that night, I had to start seriously considering my plan.

“We presently have 10 more minutes left of class. If you do not communicate to me a procedure regarding exactly how you will arrive at my place of residence at the time I have requested, I will have no choice but to reschedule in favor of a later date and time,” she said flatly. I didn’t want to wait any longer to learn more about Sleep Points. Especially now that I had randomly seen the Sandman's face tucked away in the corner of the stairwell at my own school for a brief fraction of a second.  I couldn’t let that happen.

“Do you have any suspicions at all as to where your parents might keep their car keys? I understand you are most likely under the legal age to drive. However, while I do not, in general, advocate for such flagrant violations of federal law, if you wish to continue to survive this game, you must nevertheless steal your parents’ car keys and drive to my house. I hate to ask this of you, but you simply must perform all that I have requested. Do I make myself clear?” She finished, looking me straight in the eye, very worriedly, and then looking this way and that to make absolutely certain nobody was listening in. Nobody was.

“My dad usually just keeps them on the kitchen table or somewhere like that.” I said.

“Good. Good.” Anastasia said. “Drive slowly. Not only are you underage, but it will also snow tonight. There is no snow on the ground at present, however the forecast predicts it will reach 6 inches by midnight. Therefore, you must drive with exceptional caution to ensure you arrive at my home safely. The snow will be too deep to walk through quickly and with ease. Even if it weren’t it would still likely take you a long while to get there by foot. The temperature will likely be cold such that you would suffer from symptoms of hypothermia on your travels by walking, regardless of how well you insulate yourself through various layers of clothing.” She said. “I have requested the time of 2:05 in the morning because I believe your parents will be fast asleep long before you will need to leave and will remain so long after you return home. They need not know you ever left.” She finished.

“Okay, so what time should I be pulling out of the driveway?” I asked.

“How long have you been playing Sleep Points?” She asked, seemingly on an unrelated note.

“About a week. Since Monday of last week.” I told her.

“Since Monday, February the 11th, 2019?” She repeated.

“Right.” I confirmed.

“Good. Then you are still on Stage One. This was the exact assumption upon which I have scheduled our meeting. Tonight is a Friday night. You will have nothing to fear from your clock. First, wait approximately one hour after you believe your parents have fallen asleep. Then, take their car keys, leave your house as quietly as possible, and drive as slowly as you can manage to my house. Meet me at my back door. If you arrive early, wait in your car until the time I have specified. If you arrive late, I will already be standing there, waiting for you. And if you do not arrive at all, I will have no choice but to repeat this ritual with you until eventually you arrive at my back door. I cannot sufficiently emphasize how immensely crucial it is that we talk. In person and in private. It is too dangerous to do so in class. If we ask to excuse ourselves too frequently, I have no doubt that even the likes of Mr. Brigham would take notice.” She told me. 

The bell rang, right as she had concluded her last statements to me. I quickly started racking my brain trying to muster up the courage I would need to do everything that she had just asked of me. I was just hoping that I could do it all safely and without getting into any extreme trouble with my parents. I’d already gotten grounded for a week recently, and that sucked enough on its own.  I could only imagine the trouble I'd be in if they caught me doing all of this.
