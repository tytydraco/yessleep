I didn’t quite understand why it was so important that we meet in person. Let alone in private. I guess people would’ve thought we were both mentally unstable if they overheard us. Or maybe the thing in the clock didn’t like other people not involved to know about it. If that was the case, then I had probably royally fucked up by telling Truman and Ezra about what was going on. But nevertheless, I was just glad to finally have someone else who knew something.  As absolutely ecstatic as I was to have the opportunity to sneak into a cute girl’s house in the middle of the night without her parents knowing, even beyond that, just the fact that I’d finally have someone, anyone, regardless of who or where or when it was, who could finally give me the help I needed was a total lifesaver.

I only wished it could’ve been that night. It was still Thursday night. So, if this week was gonna play out anything like last week, I’d still have to duck and cover at midnight tonight. But since the night after that, the night Anastasia told me to meet up at her place, was gonna be a Friday night, hopefully that meant I didn’t have anything to worry about. On Friday night of last week, nothing happened with the clock. Maybe it was only going to check in on me on weeknights. It must take weekends off. That was probably why Anastasia had told me to come Friday night.

I didn’t have too much time to think about the clock and the app, though. So, I figured I’d take a break from trying to figure out the seemingly deadly mysteries that had been running my life for the past week and a half. I had no reason to speculate anymore. I was finally about to talk to someone who knew what the hell was going on. Who knew what she was talking about.

Since the project in environmental science wasn’t due until March the 4th, two Mondays from then, I decided to not worry about it too much when I got home. Maybe I’d do a little bit of work on it over the weekend. But even then, I’d still have another week left after the weekend was over. So I just did my usual homework. Only the amount that would be due the next day. Which wasn’t really that much anyway. I knocked that out in about 45 minutes. I went on my phone some, but since its battery was still draining so fast, after another 45 minutes, I figured I’d just spend the rest of my day waiting for it to charge back up again.

I was still a bit sensitive about my new ill-gotten Kingdom Hearts game, so I just found other Switch games to try out and spent the rest of my night on that. But I still ended up breaking down and playing it anyway, eventually. Like I said, since they’d already spent money on it, the least I could do is get some use out of it. Even if I didn’t deserve it. Better than letting it go to waste if I had no intention of setting the record straight about all the times I was on my phone while I was grounded and wasn’t supposed to be on it. And let’s face it, I obviously wasn’t gonna do that. And I knew that.

Then before I knew it, dinner came and went and next thing I knew it was 9:30. Looking at the clocks glowing and increasingly red face, I could tell it was time once again for the nightly ordeal. But at least this time, I could endure it with the knowledge that I was about to have this shit figured out. At least this was the last time I’d have to deal with this crap before learning some tips and tricks as to how I was gonna deal with this thing. Maybe even how to be rid of it, once and for all.

That midnight, when the monster came out, I was able to stay totally still in the knowledge that maybe this would be the last time I’d ever have to deal with this thing. Maybe, after my meeting with Anastasia, I’d never have to live through this again. When the monster came out, I almost felt kinda bad for it. Since I just knew I was about to give it a run for its money the next time it tried to come for me.

On Friday morning, I had gotten a decent amount of sleep. The confidence that I’d received from Anastasia’s note had let me go to sleep with a lot less fear and anxiety about the future than what I’d been dealing with up to that point. Still didn’t feel great about the new game. But it had already been 4 days since I’d gotten it. My parents already put down the money. Maybe they could get some portion of their money back, but at that point, I figured it would be better to repay them by enjoying their gift than through what, half their money back? They’d still be missing the other half. There’d still be another maybe 25 or 30 bucks down the drain even if I did fess up. It didn’t feel great, but I figured hanging onto the game was my best option, given what I could do.

When I got to my locker in between third and fourth period, I saw Truman coming nearby. But apparently he was in no mood to give me any more trouble. I heard him talk to his friends about how he’d fucked up by breaking up with Anastasia. How he tried getting back together with her. But that she wasn’t budging. It was so weird to see the person being broken up with move on so easily and the person who did the breaking up look so crushed by his own actions. But then, I had always kinda figured that Truman wasn’t exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and never really thought things through all the way anyhow. So, this wasn’t so out of the ordinary for him.
