I remember this happening when I was very young so some details might be vague but im starting to forget the experience and I feel like it doesnt deserve to be forgotten.

I believe I was around the age of 10 when I had left my house, which was in the middle of the non-touristy florida parts, it was during a sunset and I remember the sky being vivid oranges and pinks. During my time out I was simply walking around my yard and relaxing, I supose I just needed time outta the house, maybe admiring the sky.

At some point I ended up on the trunk of my dads car, a small grey car that was close enough to the ground to allow me atop it, It was here my thoughts began to drift and I began thinking about my cousin, I believe this detail is crucial to what ended up happening that night, my thoughts about her were melancholic at best, we werent related by blood and her mother was simply a close friend of mine own. 
I still have fond memories of my cousin and still think of her as such, however a fight broke out between our mothers and she ended up moving out of state. Because I was so young i was simply sad at the prospect i wouldnt be able to play with her ever again, unable to see her. 
Perhaps the lovely sunset brought on these sad thoughts, it was my admriation of the sunset that also made me aware of an object in the sky.

A floating orb, that seemed to be spherical, moving across the sky from left to right. It had a look to it that made me think 'the distance was making this big thing look smaller' almost like what youd think when you see a flying airplane. And much like an airplane it floated with a sorta weightlessness, moving slightly slower than an airplane though.
Then, a second came into view, then two more, execpt these two seemed to be connected, imagine like a scientific structure of two molecules connected together. Again a single orb, and then three clumped together like a jumbo size molecule, except this wasnt an illistration in a book, it was very real. 
I remember clear as day these orbs came in two colors, mustard yellow and white, they even seemed to have shadows on them.

I was transfixed, future me wanted my younger self to so desperatly go inside and grab my father or AT LEAST his phone to capture what I was seeing. But at the back of my mind, even then at that moment, that if i did leave, if I simply looked away, these things would have been gone. After what id say was 15 minutes or less, the last orb drifted right over the treeline from the woods across the street. Only then, did I think it was okay to go bad inside.

Now this is where my pondering has made me go crazy, experiencing it is one thing, but then and now I wanted so bad to know what I saw. 
I went nearly straight to my brother after what I witnessed, he was about 10 years older than me then and so had access to the internet. I explained what i saw the best a child could, and he searched up something along the lines of 'supernatural floating orbs' there he read to me an article, possibly even a reddit post, detailing the experience of man who, when just a boy, sat in the living room reminiscing on a deceased family member, only to then notice a small orb, described as 'looking like static' to his left. 
After that I simply went on with life, spent a few times trying to recreate the senario, incase this was somthing spiritual?? 

I honestly just wonder WHAT these things were, to strange and different to asign any ol' title.
Ufo? Spirits? Guardian Angels?

Or simply something conceived of earths own strange nature, something that just doesnt exist.
