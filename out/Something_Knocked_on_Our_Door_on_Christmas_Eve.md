Christmas Eve was always magical in our home. The scent of fresh pine filled the air, the glow of the fireplace warmed the room, and Home Alone played softly on the TV. Snow fell gently outside, blanketing everything in peace. It was perfect—until we heard the knock.

It started softly, like someone unsure if they should disturb us. Laura, my wife, glanced at me. “Who’d be out here this late?”

We lived deep in the woods, miles from town, and no one visited without warning. I shrugged, though unease was already settling in my chest.

When I opened the door, the cold air bit at my face. The porch was empty, but the snow wasn’t.

There were footprints—bare, human footprints—leading from the forest straight to our front door.

“Hello?” I called into the night, but the only response was silence. The footprints stopped right at the porch. No tracks led away.

I stepped back inside and locked the door. “No one’s there,” I said, trying to sound casual.

“Then where did the footprints come from?” Laura whispered, her voice trembling. I didn’t have an answer.

We tried to go back to the movie, but the cozy warmth of the evening had vanished. Laura kept glancing at the window, and Ellie, our five-year-old daughter, sat quietly, clutching her stuffed bunny.

The knock came again. Louder this time.

Laura stiffened. “Don’t answer it.”

I nodded, but curiosity gnawed at me. I tiptoed to the door and peeked through the peephole.

Darkness. Nothing but darkness.

Then the knock came again—three sharp, deliberate knocks that sent chills down my spine.

“Daddy,” Ellie whispered, “he’s at the window.”

I turned and saw it.

A face, pressed against the living room window.

It wasn’t human. Its skin was pale, stretched taut over its skull, with deep black pits where its eyes should’ve been. Its mouth hung open unnaturally wide, like it was screaming silently.

Laura screamed, clutching Ellie as I stumbled back. The thing didn’t move—it just stared, unblinking, before curling its lips into the faintest, most unnatural smile.

I shut the curtains and locked every door and window in the house. My hands shook as I whispered, “It can’t get in. It can’t get in.”

The lights flickered.

For a moment, the house was plunged into darkness.

Ellie screamed.

When the lights came back on, she was gone.

The front door was wide open, snow blowing in. Outside, there was only one set of footprints leading into the woods.

I hesitated, staring at the trail as the cold air bit at my skin. My heart told me to run after her, but my mind screamed not to.

Laura grabbed my arm, pulling me back into the house. “What if it’s waiting out there?” she whispered, tears streaking her face.

And then we heard it. Faint and distant, but unmistakable.

“Daddy… help me…”

The voice was soft, trembling—just like Ellie’s. But something about it was wrong. It was too slow, too deliberate, like it was testing the words.

I took one shaky step toward the doorway before Laura yanked me back. “That’s not her,” she sobbed. “That’s not Ellie.”

She was right.

We haven’t celebrated Christmas since that night. And we never found her.
