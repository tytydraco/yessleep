I don't know how I started to suspect it but then there were obvious patterns. I did not liked to go to school but then the friends there, they were so good in melting my worries and such a satisfaction overall hanging out with them. Our school was like any normal fucking school, it was big with many classes and it has the same ugly food everyone gets. Then let's not even talk about the assembly. Getting in line for the morning to assembly, repeating some prayers and then the boring principal lectures for hours. Ok I am exaggerating there but it does feel like hours. 



Now it all started 2-3 months ago but the school changed since starting this new session. You see my school had accumulated a lot of bad reputation for bad kids and bullies around. There were some bullies - check, kids smoking cigarettes in bathroom - check. It was rampant and it's obvious that despite good academic record no parent would dare send their children to that hellhole. Then the school started expelling the biggest bad of the bunch wildly to save their reputation. I for one was very glad about this new change until they called my name. 



The thing is I agree that I wasn't good academically speaking because I never focused enough in the classes but I was never a bad boy, even completely opposite. We never bullied or harassed anyone and infact were even kind and helpful for others around us. So my name being called out was weird. I was trying to remember all the last details and acts I did and which of them led me to this trouble. I couldn't remember any and I was scheduled to meet the principal after school. 



Soon the recess hit and this poor girl Amy run towards me crying. Behind him Jack who cold stared at me. They were my best friends, the group I hang around with, us 3. 



"Tom I can't believe you were a bully" Amy said between sobs

"I swear I did not. C'mon not you guys too, you know me the best. I can't even hurt a butterfly."

"Hey Tommy boy I was wondering that are you hiding something from us? It would be a shame if you were one of those."

"Like I literally said I am not. No one even got a proof. It's just completely random and and- nonsensical." 

"We can't be seen with you Tom but I want to believe you. Let's hope what you say is true. Prove to them of your innocence."


My friends treating me like that hurted, actually a lot more. Like they were the only reason why I even attended the classes. Anyways then I first met the principal Miss Olivia. After my classes I went in there knocking at the door from outside. I was very nervous because that was the principal I was about to meet. 


"Come in" said a voice from inside and I opened up the door and gently closed it behind me. There was a large sofa on the side, a big table with a globe miniature on it, 2 chairs beside me and off to the other side was the principal. She was a big round lady with green hairs. Not that round but tended to that side. What startled me was her posture on the chair. She was half leaning with one leg flying in the air. I have never seen any adult sitting like that posture. 

"So are you Tom?"

"Yes ma'am I am. I think this is a big misunderstanding."

"Whatt no misunderstanding. See your name is here on this list."

"Are you sure this list is genuine. I think the person who crafted it made some blunder and wrote my name by accident."

"Wdym I made this list myself, teehee." Then she took out a large candy from her pockets and begin munching it. Strange behaviour for a school principal. 

"I am sorry but I still stand by what I said. There is some mistake. If not then there must be some proof some eye witnesses."

"OMG you are so basic and boring. Not fun around." She picked up another candy and begin munching it. 

"Umm can we have a deal sort of?" 

"Woahh which type of deal?" She leaped from her chair beside me excitingly. 

"Umm you clear my name and I would give you candies? Or anything you want." 

"Yayy you are so sweet. Ofc you don't deserve to be on the list of boring people then. Can we play later too?"

Ok this was enough for me. She acted just like a kid and so I just said "SURE" and went off. "Such a weird encounter but I was happy that my name was cleared atleast. 


The next day at the assembly she was giving another long ass speech. I can't believe how fast she transformed from a child to adult. Her persona and speaking ability matched an adult.


Fast forwarding to now I tried to convince my friends and other people of the strange behaviour from the principal but they didn't listen to me. Just yesterday I sneaked inside the principal's office to gather some proof about those candies so that they can believe me. There was another room adjacent to it so I tiptoed and opened it up. What I saw left my mouth gaping. 


There were 3 kids on the other side and a big carbon dress of the principal lying beside them thinned out. One of the kids wore long glasses. There were 2 girls and one boy. One of the girl looked little and the other two of my age. 


"Hey wait. Now since you have discovered our secret you can't just go away Tom." Said the boy

"I am not interested. This is so unbelieving. Like I couldn't imagine this in my wildest dreams. Our Principal was a child... Erm children literally."

"Look I know how you feel but we can't afford to let you spread it Tom. Why don't you join us as the principal."

I glanced at them for a moment and then with a big sly smile I said "SURE".
