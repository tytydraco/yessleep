I can still see it. A huge refrigerator box on my kitchen floor. A square cut hole on the side as a window. What more could a couple of kids ask for? My cousin and I were beyond excited and started playing right away. It was huge inside, dark, the tile floor was a cold retreat from the Florida heat.  

Sam and I played all day, I think my mom was in her room smoking. She always stayed in there and her room would smell like tobacco and something else..kind of spicy? Stinky? I don’t know, it didn’t matter, she left us alone and we would play all day until Sam’s dad came home. See they both lived with us. Me, Sam, mom, and Uncle Devin. It was great. 

  Me and Sam were playing in our box that night, we played maze and the imagined tunnels went winding on like a gator in a death roll. Left and right, dead ends and go backs. We jumped over booby traps and dodged poison arrows. 

My mom finally came out and sent us to bed just before we found the treasure. She’d sent me to bed but I don’t remember if she hugged me. 

I went to my white walled bedroom, I remember bunk beds and no window cover, toys strewn on the floor and an old two story doll house with iron furniture. 
I was changing in front of my window to my bed clothes and just before I fully pulled my shirt over my tummy, something wrapped on the window and scared me. I quickly pulled my head all the way through and stared hard out the window. 

The dark rectangle showing me nothing but my own shocked reflection against the black background of the night sky and woods that surrounded our house. I stared for a long time, my little heart beating out of my little chest, but saw nothing but my white blonde hair, pale skin, and buttery green blue eyes. I decided it had to be an acorn and I went to sleep. 

I don’t remember Sam coming to bed though, we shared a room and the top bunk was hers. Oh well, I was too young to care and took myself to sleep. 

That was the first night I ever dreamt of the scary tunnels, of falling and landing in different mazes. Of flying and landing back to my own cozy maze and woke up in the morning still tired… and sore? 

My throat hurt and it felt sticky inside. I swallowed but gagged as if I had toothpaste stuck in the back. 
I went to the bathroom and drank water from the sink and then went to find my mom, I didn’t see her but I smelled the funny smoke and decided to play a trick, I knocked on her door and then skedaddled to my box and hid underneath it, I giggled ridiculously and shook with excitement, I was gonna scare her! 

She’d look for me and I’d jump out like a ghostie and give her laugh! I heard my mom’s door open, dragging on the carpet in one long opening swoop, 
“Dez?” She called, I stifled another giggle and went to peer out of the small square window. 

I saw her legs, long and tanned from the Florida sun, I saw her shorts, zebra print and short, rolled up a couple times at the waists band, she walked closer to the kitchen and the box where I squatted and waited. 
I was trembling with anticipation and a surge of adrenaline, 

I was gonna do it! 

“Dez! Stop fucking playing and come ..”

“BOOOOO!” 

I jumped up, pushing the box above my head! 

A zap of lighting hit my head and everything went black.
