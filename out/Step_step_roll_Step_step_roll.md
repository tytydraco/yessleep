As soon as I sat down to do my daily sketch, I knew something was off. First, the art set had been hastily replaced facedown so that the latches were pointing the wrong way. And second, quite obviously, all of the reds were missing. Not just the markers, but the colored pencils and the crayons too.

The list of suspects wasn’t long. Riley and I are the only ones here. So, even though it was his homework time, I walked down the hall and opened his door.

“Care to explain this?” I asked, holding up the box of art supplies, the gaps obvious where the reds belonged. 

Like a dog who’d been caught ripping up a favorite chair, Riley tried not to meet my eyes.

“Well?” I asked.

“It makes them too scary,” he said after a second. “All the blood you draw.”

“They’re supposed to be scary!” I fired back. “If the drawings of Zahndents aren’t scary, what happens?”

He hesitated again, not wanting to say, but I wasn’t playing his game this time. I waited, patient and silent.

“If they’re not scary, then the real Zahndents come out,” he finally said, gesturing over to the air vent, the monsters’ preferred entry point.

I knelt down beside him and put my arms gently around him.

“I love you,” I said. “If I didn’t love you, I wouldn’t be working this hard to keep you safe.”

For a second, he was limp in my arms. Then, finally, he hugged me back.

“I’m sorry, mom,” he said. 

“I’m going to need those reds back,” I said.

He nodded and pulled open a dresser drawer, revealing the missing art supplies.

I’m not quite sure how many generations my family has been cursed for. It’s at least three or four. I knew for sure that my maternal grandfather grew up deathly afraid of the Zahndents back in Germany. He was born just a bit after the war, fatherless. 

I never met his mother, Elise, but everyone who did always described her eyes: they were said to be so blue they were almost clear. People also say that she barely spoke and perpetually stared into the distance. 

She’d been a nurse on the Eastern front during World War 2, patching together men fighting the Soviets. They were boys, really, some of them barely teenagers. Zahndents vastly prefer the taste of children. 

Elise had been captured for a time near the war’s end and never spoke of it, except to say she’d been cheerful once and then things changed forever.

Though distant, Elise managed to keep up with the family’s daily needs, working at a hospital part time and making sure my grandfather had everything he needed: clothes, food, education, etc. Often, at night, she’d end up screaming at men that weren’t there, but that was so common in those days that people just accepted it.

Great Grandma Elisa always made sure my grandpa was safe from Zahdents. She had seen men devoured by them during the war, the creatures emerging from the steam vents in the makeshift hospital, pulling their scaly, orb-like bodies through impossibly narrow gaps. And then their horrible gnashing rows of teeth liquefying the men from the feet up at the rate of an inch per second. 

She’d lost half a dozen patients like that before a fellow nurse–an older woman who’d grown up in a small village deep in the Black Forest–told her a few ways to keep the creatures at bay.

This is information that the old woman passed to Elise, who wrote it all down in German. The following is a translation from my own mother, who protected me from the creatures until I’d grown old enough to marry and have children of my own:

***Regarding Zahndents***

*The only thing that Zahndents fear is their own species. They are solitary creatures who meet infrequently to mate and birth their young–and even that process is far from safe. Cannibalization runs rampant, with females frequently consuming both their mates and their offspring.*

*Fortunately, Zahndents are not especially intelligent creatures. Driven by base instinct, they react instantly and decisively. Upon seeing another of their species (especially one that’s larger or more ferocious looking) a Zahndent’s first reaction is retreat.* 

*It thus behooves a human dealing with a Zahndent infestation or curse to trick the monsters into running away. This is best done through art: the afflicted human can create sculptures, paintings, or drawings of Zahndents and hang them near the creature's preferred points of ingress to the home. Upon seeing the images, the Zahndents usually retreat with haste.*

*Unfortunately, Zahndents are not stupid enough to be fooled for long. After a day or two, a piece of art begins to lose its potency and the Zahndent begins to realize what it is. It thus necessitates the cursed family to produce new artwork almost daily. Worse, in order to maintain a safe level of fear, it’s important that the artworks become increasingly terrifying over time.* 

*While this method of deterrence is unquestionably effective, it has the unfortunate side effect of weighing psychologically on the entire family, especially the artist.* 

In our case, spending day after day drawing the creatures has indeed led me to become fixated on them. The Zahndents are never far from my thoughts. Perhaps this is as things should be. 

My mother was a sculptor and spent most of her days carefully molding horrific statues of Zahndents before firing them in a kiln at the back of our property. Each day, a new one sat on the dresser across the room from my bed, terrifying me with its razor teeth and impossibly sharp claws. 

As time wore on, however, I found myself immune to the fear the statues were designed to elicit. I’d simply grown accustomed to them. If anything, my mother seemed to take this as a challenge. If the statues didn’t scare me, surely they wouldn’t work on the actual monsters eager to penetrate my room. Thus, her designs became increasingly horrific: the fangs longer, the necks elongated, the eyes impossibly distorted. 

And to her credit, it worked. I spent each night in abject terror, but I was never eaten.

When I was six, I had a baby brother, Amos. For some reason, we slept in separate rooms, which meant that my mother had to create a unique piece of art for each of us daily, just to make sure we weren’t devoured overnight. 

One day, time must have gotten away from her, because she left the day’s sculptures in the kiln far too long. They came out cracked and distorted. The sun was almost down. I guess she figured maybe even the cracked sculptures were good enough.

That night, I woke up to screaming. I ran to Amos’s room and found my mother holding him. Except it wasn’t him anymore, just a limp, bloody bundle of skin and blankets, maybe a few bones. In the corner, the cracked statue stood crumbling and impotent.

“It wasn’t good enough,” my mother was mumbling. “Not good enough.”

She never failed again. Every day from then on, she made more and more of the statues, sometimes leaving several in my room at a time, their terrifying teeth and too-real eyes sparing me from my brother’s fate.

At night, I hear them, of course. The Zahndents have a unique way of moving, taking a few steps and then rolling into a ball, bouncing through the vents. It used to bother me. But I am confident in my art. At least, that’s what I tell myself. 

Still, hearing that pattern–*step, step, roll, step, step, roll*–it gets to me sometimes. I’ll be laying there in the dark and then start to feel my heart go a mile a minute, just like it did when I was a little girl. 

I remember some nights waking to find my mother sitting at the foot of my bed, holding a hammer and watching the vents, muttering how she wouldn’t let them take me. Sometimes now, even though she’s been dead for years, I still half expect to wake up and find her there, waiting to bash their little skulls in.

But no. I know they won’t dare come out in Riley’s room. My work is that terrifying. I repeat that to myself again and again until the fear subsides.

I know that may sound like ego, but just ask Riley. Last week, painting with a new set of acrylics, I created a portrait so terrifying it made him cry. I’ve been really going crazy with the blood effects lately, trying to make it look like the Zahndent in the portrait has just finished off a fresh kill. It’s funny that Riley stole my reds, because even though they’re essential, it’s actually the careful use of whites and blacks that gives the blood its shine and sense of viscosity. 

Today’s work is even better. It’s pen and ink with a bit of crayon thrown in for texture. I moved on from simple blood now, so that there’s more sinew and broken flesh. I bought a few anatomy books, and I’ve been using them for inspiration: stringy guts, whole livers, the backsides of eyeballs. The realism really does make it more terrifying.

A few hours ago, as I hung it in Riley’s room, he shuddered a little as he looked at my new work. *Good,* I thought. *If he’s scared, that means it’s effective.*

“Mom,” he said. “I was thinking. Maybe we should skip a night sometime. Just as a test.” He shot me a weak smile, which I didn’t return.

“You know what would happen,” I said quietly. “My mom messed up one time with Amos, and–”

“Uncle Lou says that wasn’t even a Zahndent,” he interrupted. “He said it was just… you know. Grandma.”

“This conversation is over,” I said as I finished tacking the new artwork to the wall. And then I left him there. 

I was hoping Riley would at least come down for dinner. Instead, I waited alone at the table, finishing both plates of pasta. I watched TV alone. Finally, around eight or nine I got up to go to the bathroom and noticed the pantry door had been opened, which meant he’d snuck past me to grab a snack at some point. I trudged up the stairs to his door and knocked. No answer.

I walked downstairs feeling low. That’s just how it goes as a parent sometimes. You can’t always be their best friend. Sometimes, you just have to do what’s right for them. I grabbed an ice cream bar out of the freezer, ready to eat my feelings. Then, looking down, I saw something that made my blood run cold: my artwork–today’s artwork–torn to shreds and sitting at the bottom of the trash, like he’d *meant* for me to find it there.

It was already dark outside, and I’d been hearing thumps in the vents for hours. Right that second, my only son was sitting in his room completely unprotected, set to be devoured.

I sprinted up the stairs. I could sketch a backup in five minutes flat, something to really scare the shit out of those evil things. But first I had to make sure they hadn’t gotten Riley already. I tried the handle and found the door locked. Dammit.

I was screaming Riley’s name over and over again, but there was no answer. I pictured him completely gone, nothing but a bloody puddle on the floor. I pictured every drawing I’d done, knowing that the reality would only be worse.

Finally, I started kicking the door, again and again until it began to splinter. Finally, it fell open, and a cool breeze hit me as I ran inside. Riley was gone. Not a trace. The vents around me were thudding like crazy. Could the Zahndents have already consumed him? No, there would have at least been some kind of leftovers, blood on his sheets, bits of bone scattered somewhere.

Then, looking over, I realized his window was open. I ran to it and looked down. Off in the distance, I saw Riley. He was running toward town, his backpack bouncing with each step. He hadn’t made it too far, and I called out to him. The first time, he must not have heard me, so I screamed louder. This time, he looked back.

I’ll never forget the look on his face: it was clear, even at that distance, the same look he had when he checked out the latest piece of art I hung on his wall each day. 

He was looking at me like I was the monster.

His glance only lasted for a second. After that, he turned and ran even faster. Before long he’d disappeared into the night.

The cops have come and gone. I’ve told them what Riley was wearing, the names of his friends, a few places where he might have gone. There’s no word yet. 

In the meantime, the vents are practically exploding with sound. 

*Step, step, roll. Step, step, roll.* 

I’m here, all alone. I’m sketching, of course, my worst creation yet. It’s a Zahndent feasting on Riley’s organs, its face an expression of sheer ecstasy. 

And for the first time I remember, I’m actually [scaring myself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/10ggb5h/collected_works/)
