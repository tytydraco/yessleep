I don't know how much longer I can sit here and pretend to be okay, I can barely keep a straight face. I should probably give some context, not that I can do much else than stay on my phone right now. I had to pick my little brother up on the way home from school as my mum works evenings. So, I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary at first when I got home. The house was messy as usual, I didn't even see my mums phone under all her crafting supplies, she's probably one of the most disorganised organised people I know. I knew the routine, I'm sixteen feeling like I'm forty sometimes...Still, I made us both some food which really just was some tabbed left overs of pasta bake and chucking it in the microwave. Tommy, my brother, didn't like it much but I was tired and exams were wearing me down. 

Personally dealing with a five year old wasn't the way I wanted to spend my evening but I can now say that that would be a dream compared to what was happening now. I got home at four, ate at five and planned on trying to settle Tommy but when he went to use the bathroom he spent way too long up there and I found him crying, I tried to settle him but it took over an hour and he just kept saying he saw something. And this was a kid who watched Chucky religiously. Honestly, seeing him so shaken almost made me not want to go upstairs at all. We moved in here about two months ago but we weren't new to the area, I hadn't heard any weird stories about the house so I never suspected anything. But I should have guessed something was wrong when my cat ran away and no matter how many times we brought him back he seemed distressed and ran away. 

But I'm sitting in the living room with Tommy finally asleep on top of me. The TV was playing some rerun of a daytime show and I can barely think. I'm just trying to focus on writing this so sorry for all the rambling. I'm just scared that if I stop writing that it'll know that I know it's  there. All evening I have seen things out the corner of my eye, banging noises but I had assumed it was Tommy. But then I heard the groaning, gurgling, sorrowful moans and cries. It sounded so far away that I barely noticed it but at times it was also so loud. I don't know where it is. Or what it is. But I can hear it now. Slow, almost squeaking groans that occasionally utter my name. My mum should have been back by now but her phone went off earlier and she wouldn't leave without it. I'm starting to worry that she never managed to leave the house. 

There's a rotten smell that I'll catch every now and then, taps on the window and the floorboards will creak. What the hell is in here with me. Everything in me is telling me to be silent and still. I'm too scared to move. 

Update...the TV just automatically turned off and now I'm sat in silence but that's not the worst part. Not even slightly. I sort of glanced up while keeping my bead down and there's something standing behind me. It sounds so far away but it's right behind me. I don't know what to do. I don't think it knows that I've seen it. It keeps calling my name but it doesn't sound right. I'm praying Tommy doesn't wake up. I know I can't run. What do I do? Just sit here...wait? The smell makes me want to gag, I'm on the verge of tears and it's hand is slowly reaching out toward my hair...
