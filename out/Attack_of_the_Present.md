Blackthorne. We've gained kind of a reputation for being a town where weird things happen. And don't think we haven't heard every Ohio-is-weird joke in the book. It's like Gravity Falls in here sometimes.

Right now I'm wishing it wasn't.

It all started on the first of December. An unexpected present under the tree, all wrapped up in glittery blue paper. Addressed to 'Miranda and Lucy Keynet'! I'm Miranda Keynet, by the way.

Nobody knew who brought it. My little sister Lucy, being the six-year-old she was, thought it was from Santa and wanted to open it really badly. But my parents convinced her not to until Christmas. Looking back now, I think they were just looking for an excuse to investigate it. Bet they thought it was dangerous to us or something. Can't say I blame them. Especially after what I've seen now from that present.

And investigate they did.

Every day we stared at it under the tree. I'm ashamed to admit that even I fought Mom and Dad tooth and nail over not throwing the thing away. I was just so curious.

Lucy and I stared at it for ages. We shook it, but heard nothing rattling inside the box. Eventually I convinced myself that it was probably empty, a prank by some unknown, stupid burglar who wanted to play a prank on us. Lucy's only regret was that she hadn't been able to go all Home Alone on them and kick their butt.

My parents were more cautious, They observed it very carefully, wanting nothing to do with it, worried it might contain something dangerous.

Eventually, I convinced them to let me take it out and destroy it, secretly planning to open it. Of course I didn't tell them. I swore to everyone and pinky-swore to Lucy, who, being a little kid, held pinky-swears basically sacred.

I walked out, far away from the house, until I was in the alley behind the pizza place. I tore open the wrapping paper, revealing a battered cardboard box.

I was just about to open it when a kid behind the bins - who I hadn't noticed until now - grabbed it from my hands and ran away. He was wearing a garbage bag like a dress... I think he was homeless.

I chased him into the mall, where I searched for him everywhere, eventually finding him in the rooftop parking lot.

Dead.

No trace of what killed him. He had a shocked look on his face. The box was lying on its side next to him, open and empty except for something. I pocketed the something and ran all the way home, in shock and horror that someone wanted to...kill me and my sister.

I got home and told my parents the truth.

That is, I told them the present was gone.

They were relieved seeing me unharmed. But I was harmed all right. Just not physically.

And now I sit here, reading the something. The something was a note.
