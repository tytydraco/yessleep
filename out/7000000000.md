When my mother gave birth to me, she realized I had a very strange birth mark, which spelled 7.000.000.000 .She just thought it was a very strange coincidence, but it turned out not to be, it turned out to be something way more terrifying. 

I first noticed the birthmark when I turned 6 years old, my mother told me it was nothing important, and I didn't complain. Short after that, my mother enrolled me in school and right after kids saw my birthmark they started calling me a weirdo. I kept complaining to my mother about kids at my school making fun of me for my birthmark, she told me to just hide it, so that's what I did. For a few years the bullying stopped, until one day I took my shirt off at gym class in 7th grade. One boy annoyed me too much one day, and I've just had enough. He told me that I would never be a normal boy and I was a fucking weirdo. I've never felt so much anger in my entire life, so I just punched him in the neck, head and ribcage. He eventually stopped moving, and I thought I just knocked him out, but then my teacher came and she called 911. They finally come and they tell us that the kid died. I felt guilty, but at the same time I was happy that he wouldn't be bullying me anymore.

I went home, took my shirt off, and then I saw it. 6.999.999.999 , the number changed. I told my mother and she was terrified. Night time came, my mother and father were sleeping, I went to the kitchen and grabbed the biggest knife I could find, and then stabbed them both in the throat. They died, I looked at the number, 6.999.999.997 .It worked, I knew what I had to do to finally get rid of this fucking birthmark. For years I've been trying to get rid of this birthmark that's been bothering me for years, and I finally found a way, killing people. I first started with the homeless people that nobody would care for, and then I started entering peoples homes and killing them in their sleep, and that turned out to be the best way, in just 2 weeks I've already killed 471 people, the police are looking for me everywhere, but they will never find me since I have my house in the middle of nowhere. At one point I wanted to give up, but then I remembered why I started doing all of this, and that kept me going for all of these years. 

It's been 37 years now, the number is at 1.273.971 .I only need a few more victims to get rid of this birthmark, so be careful, you might just be the next person I kill. Sleep well tonight.
