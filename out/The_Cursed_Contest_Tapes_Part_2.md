[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/115ba99/the_cursed_contest_tapes/)

&#x200B;

I should have mentioned in the previous post that it takes me so long to update because we have to watch the tapes multiple times to ensure we don’t miss any clues. You’d be surprised what minor details can have vast implications. As for personal updates, I managed to squeeze in a night out with my friends last week, so that’s some good news. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'll be getting to the next tape. A transcription will be provided below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**\[Based on the mentioning of certain events and the media shown, the contents of this tape are estimated to take place in the late 80s, particularly between 87 and 89.\]**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The video centers around three people, two divorced parents by the names of Gerard and Ellen, ages 34 and 33. Their son’s name is Anson, age 8. There is an alarm beeping before the footage is shown. Upon it coming into focus, it’s revealed to be a POV shot from Gerard’s perspective.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “Shit! Shit! Shit!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He scrambles to get dressed. His phone can be heard ringing downstairs. Some beer bottles on the floor cause him to stumble. He catches himself and races down the steps and to his phone. He grabs it off the receiver.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Hello?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*His ex-wife Ellen replies. During their conversation a pounding similar to a beating drum is detectable.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Hey, Gerard.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Oh, Ellen. Uh, what’s going on?”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:**  “Anson wanted me to call to make sure you didn’t forget to see him, again,”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “What? Of course, I’ll see him. I’ve been getting ready. Where do you want to meet?”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:**  “The park is fine. I’ll be there in an hour.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “See you then.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Upon the call concluding, he opens a bottle of Ibuprofen and takes a pill. The footage cuts to him arriving at Stone Plaza Park. He approaches Ellen who is sitting on a bench and watching Anson play. Gerard gets their attention. Anson, smiling, runs up and hugs him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “I knew you’d come!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard hugs him back and ruffles his hair.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I wouldn’t miss seeing you for the world.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He looks up from him to Ellen. She isn’t smiling.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “So, I guess I’ll meet you back here same time on Sunday?”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Yeah, but I want to talk for a little bit before you leave.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Huh? Oh, sure. Just let me put Anson in the car first.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*They walk together back to his car. Gerard puts Anson in the back and tells him he’ll be right back.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “What did you want to talk about?”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “I hope the hangover didn’t hit you too hard this morning,”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard remains silent.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Did you really think I wouldn’t notice? For god's sake, I could smell you from the entrance.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I’ve been trying to do better.”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “You don’t need to try, Gerard. You need to actually do it and I’m sick of dealing with it and if you don’t shape up, Anson is going to get tired of it too.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “You’re right, but these things don’t just happen overnight. It takes time. Look, I’ve been seeing a professional and now I’m in the process of weaning myself off the stuff. Eventually, I’ll be off it completely. I promise.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ellen stares at him for a brief moment before replying.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Just remember that trust is a hard thing to earn back.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She seems to be staring past him so he looks too and sees Anson playing with some action figures. He turns back to Ellen who walks away without saying another word. He sighs and then gets in his car. He smiles at Anson.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “So, are you ready to have some fun? How is school?”

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “Good! I got ten gold stars!”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Ten? Wow! That’s a big number. Have you and your mom been doing good?”

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “Yeah, but she works a lot.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I know she does. Once I’ve gotten things back on track I’ll help you both out more. Now, to celebrate you doing so well in school, why don’t I let you pick where we go?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Anson thinks for a moment and grins.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “Six flags!”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Okay, we’ll go there right after we get something to eat.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard takes Anson to Mcdonald's and gets him a happy meal. After which, they head to Six Flags. There, Anson gets several photos with the mascots and prizes from games. Most notably, a stuffed Bugs Bunny from a mallet game. While their options for rides are limited, they do make the most of it.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard watches Anson get on the kids’ roller coaster. During this, Anson is noticeably less energetic on the ride compared to the other children. In fact, he almost seems to nod off at several points. When he gets off, he walks as if severely disoriented and almost falls, but his dad catches him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Hey, buddy, are you alright?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Some of the park staff come up to check on them and ask if everything is okay.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Yeah, he’s probably just tired.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He picks up Anson and carries him back to his car. He murmurs to him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “I want…Other rides.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I know. You’ll get to them next time I promise. Besides, the park will be closing soon anyway so why don’t you have a nap and then we can see a movie? A new one came out last week, right? I think it was called Roger Rabbit. It has Bugs Bunny in it. Do you want to see it with me?”

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “Yeah…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He falls asleep. Gerard puts him in the back and straps him in. The footage cuts to them sitting down in the theater to see the movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? At first, Anson is excited, seeing all his favorite characters on screen. As it goes on, though, he is again fighting not to fall asleep.*

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** "Hey, you'll miss seeing Bugs if you fall asleep. Here, have some of this."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He offers Anson some Coke and he takes a sip. This gives him a brief energy post. Gerard offers him some popcorn. He eats several handfuls. Time passes and Anson laughs at several points during the movie.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*All appears to be well. Then he groans.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** "Hey, what's wrong?"

&#x200B;

**Anson:** "I don't feel…"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He vomits.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** "Shit!"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A theater employee comes to check. He apologizes and is told that they'll take care of it. He picks Anson up.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** "I think that's enough for one day. Let's Get you home."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage cuts to him tucking Anson in with his stuffed Bugs Bunny. He exits the bedroom and goes downstairs to call Ellen.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Gerard, it’s after midnight. Why are you calling?”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Sorry, I was just kind of concerned about Anson.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ellen replies, sounding more alert.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “How come?”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Did he ever tell you he wasn’t feeling good before you gave him to me or maybe did he look like he was acting strange?”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “No, not that I can remember. Has something been happening with him?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard explains what happened that day.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I’m going to take him to the doctor tomorrow. I’m sure he’s just dealing with a bug or something.”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Okay, let me know how it goes.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Sure thing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The footage cuts ahead to the inside of a hospital room where Anson sleeps in a bed, Ellen is also present. During this, there is a thumping noise. A doctor walks in and introduces himself as Wilber Ochoa. The parents introduce themselves as well.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “So, did the scan show anything?”

&#x200B;

**Wilber:** “I didn’t want to bring this up until we were sure. However, it seems like a pretty clear diagnosis at this point.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard speaks up, sounding as if he’s straining to keep his voice level.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “Tell us why he’s sick.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The thumping grows louder.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Wilber:** “We found a tumor in his brain and unfortunately, it’s malignant, severely malignant.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The thumping stops.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen**: “No, that…That can’t be.”

&#x200B;

**Wilber:** “I’m sorry, but that’s what everything seems to be pointing to.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “What can we do for him?”

&#x200B;

**Wilber**: “There’s no easy way to say this. I’ve never seen one this bad in my thirty years of working in this field. We can try some treatments. It’s just that with a severe case, it’ll have to be exceptionally strong, and I’m not sure if your son could handle it. We can try it, but I can’t guarantee it’ll be effective.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “We’ll try to take it one step at a time then.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 I’ve seen awful things, Yet,  I know this is the kind of thing that makes someone feel especially powerless.  Seeing someone you love suffering and not being able to do anything about it is a horror I do not wish on anyone. God, if it’s that bad for me just watching the tape, I can only imagine what it was like for them. With tapes such as these, there’s an atmosphere to them that makes you feel as if you are in the footage with the people shown. In a way, you feel as if you’ve already known them for a while

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That’s why I find Ludus to be the most dangerous entity we’ve ever come across. It’s clear that it’s familiar with the emotional side of humanity and how to manipulate it. What it’s trying to gain by doing so we still have yet to figure out. Hell, I’m not sure if it even has a higher purpose beyond sadism.  At least I know what it is, a predator plain and simple, one I intend to eliminate.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The tape does something unusual at this point. Instead of going forward in time, it goes backward, showing three events, two of which take place prior to Gerard and Ellen’s divorce. The first shows him throwing up in their bathroom.  He stumbles out, not seeing Anson running past him to go downstairs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*In the process, he accidentally knocks him down the steps. Hearing this, Ellen immediately rushes to their son’s aid as Gerard also runs to him. Ellen screams at Gerard.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “What the hell is the matter with you?”

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “I-i’m sorry! I didn’t see him!”

&#x200B;

**Ellen**: “Maybe if you cut back on the beers, you would have!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She decides to take Anson to the hospital, leaving Gerard behind. He groans.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “Fucking hell…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*The second event this time has him alone with Anson during his bath. The footage goes in and out of focus. Anson is playing with some toys. Gerard tells him he’ll be right back. He passes out in the hallway and wakes up to Ellen shrieking at him from the bathroom.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “Gerard, get in here now!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He stumbles up and dashes to her where she finds her kneeling above an unconscious Anson, pushing on his chest. Gerard speaks in a shaky voice.*

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “What’s the matter with him?”

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “What’s the matter? You were supposed to be watching him!”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She continues pushing on his chest. He coughs up water. She cries and scoops him up in a towel.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard**: “Ellen, I-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She interrupts him, her voice sounding icily calm.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “I’m taking him to my parents. I've been meaning to spend a few days out of the house anyway.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “You mean away from me?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*She leaves without saying anything else. The final event shows them both in court. The judge, a woman by Janice Larsen gives her verdict.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Janice**: “After seeing the evidence presented before me, it is this court’s decision that sole custody of Anson Valdez be granted to Ellen Hill. Mr. Valdez, you will get him two weekends of every month.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It cuts back to Gerard back in his son’s room.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Please, I can’t lose him. I can’t lose the one thing I’m doing right.”

&#x200B;

**Unknown Voice:** “Gerard…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He looks up. His name is said again. follows the voice to the radio on his kitchen table.  His name comes from it. The voice is later revealed to be Ludus.*

&#x200B;

**Unknown Voice:** “No, this isn’t your imagination, Gerard, I can assure you that. Haven’t you been clean for over a month now? Give yourself some credit.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He glances around, presumably trying to find an intruder. He grabs a knife.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Look, I don’t know who you are or how you’re doing this, but get the hell out of here before I have to hurt you!”

&#x200B;

**Unknown Voice**: “This is no trick. It’s all real regardless of whether or not you believe it and I come offering you a chance to save your son.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Hearing this, Gerard gave his undivided attention.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Unknown Voice:** “You can call me Ludus. How I know so much about you is something you do not need to concern yourself with. All you need to know is that I’m the only chance your son has of living.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “What do you want? Money?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Oh, please, such things are of no value to me. No, what I want from you is to play a game.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “A game? What kind?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “It will be one of tolerance. Should you win, your son’s health is guaranteed. If you lose, well, let’s just say you won’t be far behind him. You are free to refuse, however. You can walk away and cherish the time you have with him. Then move on as best as you can.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Like hell, how do we play?”

&#x200B;

Ludus: “If you insist. All I’ll need to participate is something shiny.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard holds up his knife.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Gerard: “Okay, what now?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus doesn’t reply. He glances at the eyes of his reflection in the blade. They wink. He yells and drops the knife to the floor. A hand seems to reach out from inside the blade. However, it’s thin and stretched out in a way that’s similar to old cartoons.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Believe me when I tell you that when we watched this it was like there were spiders crawling down my back. It’s as if something that was never meant for our world was squeezing its way in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*A second hand follows it. They flail around until grasping the counter and sink. The head squeezes out, looking like Gerard’s face if it were stretched out. Soon, the rest of the body emerges, being so tall its head touches the ceiling. Gerard, staring up at it, scoots back on the floor.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “Now then, are you ready to play?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It offers Gerard a hand up. He refuses to take it and stands on his own.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I’m ready when you are.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus’s face stretches into a smile. It reaches down, picking the knife off the floor.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “The rules are simple. Whoever gives out first loses and we can’t leave this room.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Still grinning, takes the blade and stabs it into the palm of its hand. Blood seeps from the wound when it yanks it out. Then it extends the handle to Gerard who is hesitant to take it. He draws in a breath and takes it. Knowing what is expected of him, he raises the blade above his hand and murmur*s.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “God help me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He brings the knife down, stabbing the blade into his palm. He lets out a stifled scream as blood also pours from his wound. Much like its game with Gwen, it seems that those participating are granted the ability to survive otherwise fatal injuries. Gerard twists the knife, freeing it. His breathing is rapid.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “What now?”

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “It’s your turn to pick what we go through.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard’s eyes fall on his garbage disposal.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “You think you’re going to win?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He flips the switch, causing it to whir.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I’ll wipe that smirk off your ugly fucking face.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*He thrusts his hand into the drain. His yells of pain fill the kitchen as blood shoots up from his hand. After about half a minute, he finally pulls his hand free.  What’s left of it is some meaty knarled stubs.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I consider myself to have a pretty strong stomach and yet I wanted to throw up when I saw that. Don’t get me wrong. I’ve come across some gory shit, but the fact Gerard did that to himself is what makes it so much worse for me and the glee Ludus got from seeing his pain. It’s the kind of thing that stays with you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard collapses to the floor, out of breath.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “Beat that…Mother fucker.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus’s expression is neutral. Then it breaks into an even wider smile than before.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “With pleasure.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It does the same as Gerard. Despite its enjoyment, it is clear that the pain is taking a toll on it. This is evidenced by it staggering back upon freeing its hand.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I’ll do whatever it takes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus stares down at its finger stubs and then back at him.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I must admit your conviction is something to be admired. Perhaps in other circumstances, things would have worked out in your favor. Unfortunately, while the soul may be willing, the flesh is weak. This time, we’ll be sharing in each other’s pain.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*It points to the stove. The knobs on it turn and the oven door falls open.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I swear I could smell the gas that was filling the kitchen in that video. Knowing what was coming twisted my stomach.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “It’s only from ashes that potential can truly rise.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Fire erupts from the oven, covering the kitchen in flames, accompanied both by Garard’s screams and Ludus's laughing.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*I could feel the heat seeing that footage. It was like standing next to a roaring campfire. Unfortunately, it was clear who the winner was.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*After several minutes, the flames seize and the room clears. The view indicates that Gerard is lying on his back. He raises his hands, seeing them charred. Meaty footsteps can be heard. A scorched Ludus leers down at him. Its lips were entirely burnt off.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ludus:** “I know you must be disappointed right now. If it’s any consolation, you were quite entertaining and you will be able to guide your son through his final moments.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ludus walks away. Gerard yells both for help and in pain until he passes out. He wakes up later in ICU, covered in bandages with Ellen sitting in the chair beside his bed. She explains that she came by to get a toy of Anson’s from him but called an ambulance when she found him on the floor.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Ellen:** “What were you doing in there?”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I don’t know how I can explain it. Listen, I don’t know how much longer I’ll last so it’s  important you do something for me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ellen nods. Gerard tells her to ask that he be put in the same hospital as Anson. His request is granted and the footage cuts to him there in another bed beside Anson’s. Ellen is also there. Her eyes are red and puffy. Some family and friends are also present.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Anson:** “Dad, I’m scared.”

&#x200B;

**Gerard:** “I know. I am too so let’s go together.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Gerard takes his hand. The video concludes by fading to black with the noise of flatlining beeps in the background.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This kept me up for a few days. Every time I closed my eyes, I would somehow find myself going through what Gerard did. Hell, I still have that nightmare sometimes among others. Therapy has helped somewhat at least. I need to wrap up this post, though so I’ll explain what we found by going to the town the events took place in. We managed to get in touch with the family and friends of the victims.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Through them, we learned that Ellen moved away a year after the death of her ex-husband and their son and has since gotten remarried, having three more kids. That’s some good news at least. I sincerely hope she is doing well. As for Ludus, my fear and hatred of it only grow stronger by the day. I know the threat it poses and I will not stop until this monster is ended.
