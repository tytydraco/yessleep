Congratulations, you have finally been hired to clean toilets of the building during the night hours of 10PM to 6AM. You will be paid $500 every night for your service, now you might be wondering that its too good to be true, you'd be right because it really is, we wouldn't pay someone $500 every single night for simply cleaning toilets, we are actually flabbergasted at the fact that you didn't even bother to question why the pay was so high, you absolute moron. The job comes with a set of rules that are to be strictly followed by you to ensure your survival, failure in doing so will result in unfortunate outcomes for you. and now that we know how truly dull witted you are, we might as well tell you that this is not a joke, we are a multi billion dollar corporation, we do not have times for these silly jokes, if you decide to shrug these rules off as a joke, you honestly deserve it for being so brain-dead.

Here are the rules:

1) your shift begins at 10PM and ends at 6AM, you are expected to attend to your duties at these hours. You cannot enter afte 10PM and once you've entered the building, you can't leave until 6AM, no matter how urgent it might be. You can't turn away now, you have already signed the contract.


2) The building has 30 floors in total, including the ground floor, no more and no less, if you see any number beyond 30 on the elevator's floor options, you are recommended to not try and visit it, you do not need to clean the toilets in those floors.


3) While cleaning toilets, you can use the toilets for yourself during certain conditions, which are:

i) you do not take more than 10 minutes in the stall.

ii) the lights are on ("they" like to be a little mischievous sometimes, you do not want to mistake sand paper as toilet paper like one of our old employees.)

iii) you clean the toilet after using it.

iv) if there is no toilet paper, then look for the small red button, pushing the button will cause a large tongue to come out of the toilet and lick you clean, we do not recommend using these toilets but if you're into that shit then you can definitely feel free to use them, we won't judge you.


4) if during your toilet cleaning  session, you encounter a stall that is occupied, do not disturb anyone or anything that might be in the stall, let it be, you don't need to clean that toilet, just simply move on and start cleaning the next stall, also don't try to peek in the occupied stall, you will always find something already staring back at you.


5) this one doesn't actually have anything to do with ghosts and stuff, but there is one particular toilet in the 3rd floor, it is always full of shit and absolutely stinks, it is Bob's toilet. Fortunately, you do not need to clean Bob's toilet, we value the well being of our employees, so we have already employed an extremely skilled toilet cleaner for that specific toilet, you can skip it, but you can also try to clean it if you really hage yourself.


6) sometimes the lights may go out, this usually happens 1 to 3 times a night, during these blackouts, you are recommended to stop cleaning whatever toilet you were cleaning and exit the stall immediately, lock the stall and turn on the flashlight you have been provided by the corporation. Of you happen to be using a toilet during one of these blackouts, pray. If you are lucky and "it" isn't much hungry, you could leave the toilet without flushing (the shit was enough to end "it"'s appetite today, thank God if this happens) but if you're unlucky, you will go into the toilet with your shit, and probably never come out.


7) do not fall asleep, atleast not in the toilet rooms. If you sleep on your back, you will either not wake up at all or wake up with a foul taste in your mouth and occasionally also some brown clay like substance staining your lips. Also exiting the toilet rooms doesn't ensure your safety from the "silent shitters". If you sleep on your stomach, you will wake up completely intact but you will soon notice that your ass feels sore and sometimes you can also wake up with red cheeks, not the cheeks on the mouth btw. You can drink some coffee from the vending machines, just make sure there are brand names on the coffe can before drinking it.


8) speaking of beverages, if cardi b ever approaches you during your shift and offers you some "beverage", kindly decline her offer, if she doesn't leave, you are allowed to use the shotgun you have been provided by the corporation.


9) no matter how urgent it might be, try not to shit in the stalls with black doors, the hands would not let the shit ext your asshole, they will keep pushing it back it, and you wouldn't be able to do anything about it. Sometimes the hands also rip off your balls if you stay persistent so watch out for that too if you want to keep your bloodline going.


10) This is probably the most important rule of all, do not jerk off in our toilets, it's not only unfavorable for the corporation, it would be harmful for you too. You will notice that you will permanently get stuck in post nut clarity after jerking off, you will never feel lust or ecstasy your entire life, we highly value the well being of our employees so we would strictly advise you against jerking off in the toilet.


Tomorrow night is your first shift, and you are obliged to attend it because you nonchalantly signed all the papers we gave you while thinking about the money, you greedy idiot. Good luck.
