 Nightmarish. Jolting upright, after a sleep’s worth of squeamish dreams of sickness and sorrow, towards my phone I turned off the alarms that pierced my ears, seeming to hit my brain like stones.

 I hadn’t slept well. This was not unusual by any means. Horrors from day-to-day, from global to personal, followed me to slumber and held me captive there till waking. However, now it was 4:30AM. Time to ready for the workday, which was a thirteen-hour shift at an oil pipeline, where I sat in my car as a gate guard. I’d gotten the gig two weeks ago, when the previous gate guard who worked my spot went missing. Easy job for the most part. I’m in Texas, so the heat is suffocating some days and for some hours, but the hardest part is keeping myself occupied, entertained, and sane.

No meagre feat.

I begin my coffee’s brew and pack my things. I dress, finish my coffee, brush my teeth, and head out the door. The night is a rich, deep dark. So black that I can’t see anything around me. I unlock my car to trigger her headlights, so I’m able to see my way to her. The drive is eerie, quiet, and puts me on edge. My headlights illuminate only just enough to see the way, and out of their reach in the beginnings of shadows I swear I see a deer on the roadside. Except, it looked like it had a human’s face. I blink, and once my eyes are open again, I am passing where I thought the deer had stood, nothing there now.

 The world still asleep, the time just reaching 5:45AM, I arrive at my gate fifteen minutes early.

“Fuck”, I breathe out, irritated. I reach into my pocket and find the gate’s keys, readying myself to unlock it. *I’m already here thirteen hours, why did I leave fifteen minutes earlier than usual today, I could’ve slept in if anyth*-

I’m outside unlocking the gate, distracted by pissy thoughts, when a sound brings me to a pause. Talking. I hear talking somewhere in the pitch black. I can’t distinguish the voice, nor place where it’s coming from. Forest and brush surrounds me. No one is supposed to be out here this early with me, hell the gate ain’t even unlocked yet, but I definitely hear a voice.

 “*Hey! Hey,* ***you****,”* Someone whispers in the dark. Immediately my hairs are stood, and I shake with fear. I still can’t place where it’s coming from. Knots form in my stomach, tangling terror around my organs and spreading to my chest and throat. The voice sounded *wrong*.

“*You, you, hey you, you, hey you, you, you,”* the voice jeers again, and I begin to understand my dread. The voice is familiar somehow, but distorted and the emphasis is in the wrong parts of words, the cadence changing constantly.

 I’m still standing by the gate, unknown distance between me and the voice. I bite my fear and chew courage into my cheek, beginning to start towards my car when I see it. The deer. The one I’d seen on my way. My eyes are adjusted to the darkness enough to make it out just so. It stands inside the brush.

 Fright seizes my body and I bite harder, cheek blood pooling into my mouth.

The deer, which is *not* a deer, does indeed have a human face. A recognizable one. But, before I’m able to process the face further to decide it, the lips part and speak.

“You, you, youuUUuu’re *bleeding*,” the voice moans, drawing out it’s words and changing their pitch in what I can only describe as excitement. The face’s lips are parted, but they aren’t moving to shape the words, rather just hanging open limply. The cheeks are gaunt, and there is an expression of pain and fear etched into the muscles. The eyes are wide open, but they look uncanny and wicked. I realize the face itself has no eyes, only holes in which another being looks through with its own judgements. The deer is wearing a human’s face as a mask. My fear strengthens tenfold as I recognize the face as the missing gate guard, the man whose position I’d taken; the face which consumed every flyer, local social media post and news outlet the last two weeks.

I remember a post I’d seen of the man, made by his girlfriend. A video of them plays in my head, his laughter and speech ringing through it. This thing is wearing his face and parroting his voice.

The deer steps forward once, my car’s headlights revealing it’s form, the distance between us somehow significantly shortened as though it had taken twenty steps instead. It looks less like a deer now in the light, but more so something sculpted from the memory of a deer. The proportions are off, and there are extra features and appendages. To my horror, a cloak wraps the thing’s shoulders made up of faces stitched skillfully with twine. I recognize many from missing posters throughout the years; faces of different ages, races, and identities sewn into a large, long sheet which blankets their collector. Slender, humanoid arms emerge from beneath the cloak and the hands reach up to the creature’s face. It caresses the frame of the human mask gently but doesn’t remove it. Instead, it remains that way for a moment, stroking the skin almost lovingly. It never takes its eyes off me, nor mine it.

 “I *liked* this *one*,” It finally croaks. One of the hands reaches towards me.

 “*Please*,” I request, the words *don’t hurt me* dying in my throat. I taste blood on my lips and realize it has smeared across the lower half of my face from the wound in my cheek. The thing pauses, It’s eyes shut and It breathes in deeply. After this, once It’s eyes open again, It is different. More intentional, calculated, and ready.

 “Yours however is my favorite” It says, but the voice sounds different now. It sounds like mine, an obvious panic audible under the cheerful delivery. It gurgles and distorts as the thing speaks, but nonetheless *that* voice is *mine*. “Be careful with it.”

 It extends It’s arm to meet my lips, and presses a cold thumb into them to wipe away some of the blood. That is the last thing I remember before waking up on the ground, my back to the earth and face looking towards the sky. Feet stomp around me; some run, some move quickly, and some frozen. I sit up and look around, seeing my supervisor, cops, and other gate guards moving around the vicinity. They are all serious, panicked even. Some call out my name.

 “Hey!” I try to call, but the words are caught inside my mouth, a muffled sound escaping me instead. I wave my hands around, and stomp, and try to force the words from me. No one seems to see me, and I am unheard.

 “I don’t fucking know, man,” my supervisor grunts to a cop, “Gate ain’t even unlocked. Don’t have a god damn *clue* what could’ve happened. He should’ve been the only one out here.” He gestures to keys on the ground, which are marked. I recognize them as my gate’s keys. My hands fly to the pocket I keep them in, and of course find nothing. I stagger to my supervisor and grab his arm. I’m desperate to alert him I am *right* here. He doesn’t even *feel* me.

 In the reflection of his sunglasses, which hang from his collared uniform, I see myself there. I’m not sure how I’m able to accomplish this, as I have no eyes. I don’t have any of my features. My face is gone.

 Movement reflects behind me, and I spin around. In the wood, I see faceless bodies disappear behind trees and bushes, hiding from what approaches me. The missing man’s face has been quilted into the cloak, my face replacing the creature’s old mask. An arm extends from the cloak, reaching towards It’s face and mimicking a falling tear with one finger, drawing the end of the gesture into a *shhh* position on my lifeless lips.
