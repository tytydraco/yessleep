I moved into my new apartment two weeks ago. It’s a small, one-bedroom unit on the second floor of an old building downtown. The rent was cheap, and I was eager to get out of my cramped, noisy place. The apartment wasn’t much—worn-out carpets, faded wallpaper, and ancient appliances—but it was mine. Finally, a space to call my own.  
  
The first night I stayed there, I felt strangely uneasy. It wasn’t anything specific—just the sort of nervousness that comes with being in a new, unfamiliar place. But by the time I climbed into bed, I had forgotten all about it. The city outside my window was quiet, and I drifted off quickly.  
  
When I woke up the next morning, the kitchen light was on. I was sure I’d turned it off before I went to bed. In fact, I always double-check the lights when I leave a room. But there it was—bright and glaring, casting a sharp shadow across the counter. I shrugged it off, thinking maybe I was just too tired and had forgotten. The place was old; the wiring probably wasn’t great.  
  
The next night, the bathroom light was on. I hadn’t even been in there before bed. It was as though someone had turned it on in the middle of the night. But I convinced myself it was another oversight on my part. Old building. Faulty wiring. It wasn’t a big deal.  
  
But the pattern continued.  
  
Every night, a different light would be on when I woke up. The living room, the hallway, the bedroom lamp. It was always something. And it was always after I had turned everything off and settled in for the night.  
  
I started to get paranoid. Maybe I wasn’t turning the lights off as carefully as I thought. Maybe I was sleepwalking. I started setting up my phone to record at night, just to see if I could catch anything unusual.  
  
The first time I checked the footage, I was met with a blank screen. No recording at all. I had been charging the phone, so the battery wasn’t an issue. The file was there, but it was completely empty, as though it had never even been turned on.  
  
That’s when I decided to do something about it. The next night, before bed, I unscrewed the bulbs from every light in the apartment. If they couldn’t get power, they couldn’t turn on. I was sure this would fix the problem. I went to bed feeling smug, convinced I had outsmarted whatever was happening.  
  
But the next morning, I woke up to a nightmare.  
  
Every single light was on again.  
  
I shot out of bed, my heart racing, and ran to the living room. The bulbs I had unscrewed the night before? They were screwed back in. And they were all glowing brightly, as if they had never been touched.  
  
But that wasn’t the worst part.  
  
My furniture had been rearranged. The couch, the chairs, even the coffee table—everything was moved. And it wasn’t just haphazardly placed. No, everything was positioned carefully, deliberately, as if someone had spent hours aligning each piece, making sure it faced my bed.  
  
I froze, staring at the scene. My mind raced, trying to make sense of it. But it didn’t.  
  
There, in the middle of the living room floor, was a mirror. One I didn’t own. And in the mirror, written in what looked like dust or ash, were three words:  
  
**“STOP UNSCREWING THEM.”**  
  
That was it. I couldn’t stay here any longer. I grabbed my things, slammed the door behind me, and ran. I’ve been staying at a friend’s place for the past few days, but I can’t shake the feeling that whatever is in that apartment is still following me. The lights are still out of control, and I know it’s only a matter of time before it finds me again.  
  
If you’re reading this and you ever notice the lights turning on when they shouldn’t, don’t ignore it. Don’t go back. Whatever is in the dark is far worse than you can imagine.
