I saw my first miracle on the pebbly shores of that placid lake painted orange by the watching sun. But it wasn’t just us and the sun; the birds had gathered too, on the trees and the cabins and the shores.

From out of the pines men carried a figure: a clumsy graceful thing. They held its white robes so it didn’t walk, but rested on their arms. Though, it tried to walk, much too slow and strokes much too wide. When it got to the lake it kept up those strides. It danced over top that glassy fire, not even a ripple to whisper a footstep.

They asked if anyone had faith enough to follow. The first walked halfway before the waters gave way. The second passed the first as he thrashed. The second made it all the way to those white robes, but as it held her face the waters took her too.

We fell upon the ground. We wept. We danced. We cried out in praise. A miracle. We were terrified.

Too enraptured to notice, I think we worshiped as they drowned.

After graduating High School I had two competing aspirations. Growing up in the church I felt I had some obligation to go into ministry. After all, all my role models worked or volunteered at the Church. But, I also wanted to be a journalist. Not only was I passionate about the truth, but the excitement of getting out of this town and getting paid to do it seemed too good to be true. Being a missionary seemed like a good compromise. I would still get to see the world and win souls for Jesus all at the same time.

It was around that time the Pastor of my small town Church gave a sermon on synchronicity. But, my pastor didn’t talk about synchronicity in the same way Carl Jung did. He called them little miracles. He said they were the Holy Spirit whispering his will into reality from just beyond our perception. He said that if we listened carefully, sometimes those whispers were clear signs; clear instructions about what God wanted from us. He gave examples about how he'd get a feeling he needed to pray for someone, then he’d ask what they needed prayer for only to find out some tragedy had just befallen them.

He said the same day he’d been asked to resign from another Church, an old friend from seminary called him about a job opportunity at this Church. He went on to minister here for almost 17 years. He said it was a clear instruction from God, and the proof was his long successful work here. 

In my state of unease, unsure about what to do with my life after High School, the idea that God would give me a clear sign about what to do with my life for the next two decades was about the most appealing thing someone could tell me. After the sermon I asked if I could meet him for coffee the next day to talk about my future. He was more than happy to oblige. 

Growing up in the youth group this was nothing new. I’d cherished these kinds of talks. He was like an uncle, or close family friend. Not just to me, but to most of the kids at the Church. He was always at our games and our plays. He helped coach the soccer team. He always sent our families cards on Christmas. In fact, he sent everyone in the church birthday, Christmas, and get well soon cards.

I know what you’re thinking. Small town pastor taking an interest in a young boy. I assure you it was nothing like that. His interest in myself and the other kids was nothing but wholesome. He took a hard stance on maintaining healthy boundaries even when parents stopped feeling the need for them. We weren’t allowed to be at the office with him unless someone else was in the building and his door was open. He was even the one to suggest the Church get cameras so that no volunteers or staff could ever really be with kids unsupervised. He always told us to be wary, to never isolate ourselves with someone we didn’t know, especially authority figures.

The next day I met him at the Church. When my presence pulled him out of his study he laughed, made some jokes about always being a week behind on his sermon, and told the receptionist he’d be back in an hour or so. He texted my Mom I’d arrived and we walked around the block to the coffee shop.

Once we sat down, I told him all my concerns. Just talking to someone so eager to listen made the torrent of my adolescent thoughts a little clearer. He told me he’d felt similarly at my age, that my parents probably did too and that I should tell them everything I told him. But, what excited me most was what he showed me.

He pulled up an email on his computer from earlier that day. It was a newsletter containing an advertisement for a year long missionary boot camp out in Oregon. It boasted training that would equip young adults with all the skills they needed to be successful as a missionary, as well as connecting kids with full time positions all over the world. They just wanted $500 dollars for room and board for the whole year, and promised your money back if we couldn’t land a job.

That price point seemed too good to be true. Looking back on it I guess that’s part of the trap. Get rid of your kids for long and for cheap. You can even be proud of them too. 

He told me normally he’d be suspicious of these kinds of programs, that they could be well meaning but misguided. He said it’s easy to get high on emotions on these kinds of trips, to lose track of truth, to see God where he isn’t. But, given the subject matter of his last sermon, everything I’d told him about wanting to be a missionary, and the timing of the email, he thought it may be whispers from God. I asked him to forward it to my mom. He did.

And simple as that, I joined a cult. It’s ironic: I think growing up in such a good church blinded me and my parents to the signs.

After arriving in Oregon with swathes of other bright eyed kids we were greeted by so many vibrant and passionate adults, blue skies, green hills and fluffy clouds. I’d never seen so many trees; I’d never met so many happy people. I thought it looked like Heaven. We played get to know you games with staff so earnest and eager. We sang songs and prayed until the sun went down and into the night. I think we were all tired, but I couldn’t tell; the positive energy charged the air and kept us animated.

It must’ve been 1am by the time they started telling us the rules. First, they told us basic stuff about respectful behavior, boys sticking with boys and girls sticking with girls. Then they took our phones, assuring us we’d get them back later. This was to cut down on distractions so we could focus on God. They told us our group leaders were in charge of us, and that we couldn’t go anywhere without letting them know. This was for our safety. Then they divided us into groups, assigned us counselors, put us in vans, and sent us into the woods. We were already far too tired and in love to see the red flags. I never did get that phone back.

I had the privilege of riding with the program director: a silver haired man full of life and passion. He asked me all about my home, my family, and my hobbies. I’d never seen a man his age fake interest in video games so well. I was reading Matthew 14 in that van to impress him. When he saw, he mentioned that was the chapter Jesus walked on water. He told me God had so many good plans for this year, that God was so happy I’d come. He told me I was in the right place. Coming from someone like him, who seemed to know exactly what God wanted, who seemed to love me so much, those words were power. I was in the right place.

But I wasn’t, because that next morning it wasn’t God out on that lake.
