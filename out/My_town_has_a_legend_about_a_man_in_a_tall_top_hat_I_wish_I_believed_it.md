I never liked urban legends. Something about the great unknown put a deep, nagging frustration in me, and I could never just let something go once I'd snagged on it. Like a frayed thread I would pull and pull until the whole thing unravelled, or there was no more slack left to give. It wasn't just stories -- I had a deep, instinctive urge to *know* rather than just assume or accept.

Growing up, this put me in conflict with my family. They all thought differently -- they never bothered to ask *why,* or *how.* It wasn't usually an issue, necessarily, just one of those little things that made us who we were. My brothers never bothered themselves with why the sky was blue, or why thunder boomed in the sky before lightning struck. They just knew that was how it was, and left it there. 

"Got it from your father," my mother would say as she listened to me whinge with saintly patience. I was the only girl, and I seemed a kindred spirit to her more than him -- he'd inherited his stoic, uncurious attitude from his father, he said. Knowing wouldn't change anything, he said. And if it won't change, there's no point paying it any heed.

I suppose it's only right that this seed was planted on Halloween. We'd attended a party at my uncle's house, and while the adults chatted over drinks in the living room, us children sat in a tight circle upstairs, swapping ghost stories with only a flashlight for comfort.

It was my cousin who told us the story, and he promised us and even crossed his heart that it was true. His father -- my uncle -- had told him, you see, so it *had* to be true. 

He told us that in our town, in the Victorian times, there was a man who walked the streets at night, wearing a black coat and a top hat so tall it would brush against the trees as he went. As time went on, he became a sort of macabre tradition; he even had his own nursery rhyme.



*"There is a man in a tall hat*

*Who wants to come and play,*

*And if your friends are nice to him*

*He'll send you on your way.*

  
*Lonely children he likes best*

*Since they can come to stay,*

*And if you want he'll be your friend*

*And take you far away."*



So it was, and so everyone seemed to believe -- if you ran into him in a group, he would doff his hat and keep on walking. If you ran into him alone... well, no one's ever claimed to have run into him by themselves, or so my cousin said. 

It was all too *convenient* for me. I mean, think about it. You can't run into him by yourself or risk disappearing, and everyone who's ever seen him was in a group? A group of kids chomping at the bit to come up with a spooky story to scare their friends? Of course. I said as much myself, and my cousin swore on his mother's life that my uncle had told him so. 

So, of course, I did a little detective work. I sidled up when he and my father were chatting in the back garden (though I was meant to be in bed) and asked him if he'd really seen the man in the top hat. They both got solemn -- uncharacteristically so -- but seemed to share a glance amongst themselves and shrug it off. "Should we?" my uncle asked my father, and he let the question sit for a minute before he answered.

"Aye, alright. I suppose she's old enough... but you mustn't tell anyone, Ellie, understand? Not your friends, not your mother, *no one.* Sleuthing little bugger..."

My name's Ellie, by the way. Probably should've led with that. 

Anyway, they told me that the story my cousin had shared was *partly* true -- or, so they believed. Their fathers *had* seen the man in the top hat, and told them much the same. Conveniently, both my grandfathers had passed by then, and the one grandmother I had left -- on my father's side -- was in a nursing home in the latter stages of dementia. 

They said that he didn't kill people, not in the literal sense. As far as they could surmise, they believed he 'took them far away', in my cousin's words -- in my uncle's, he took their souls. What made them want to live. He turned them into pale imitations of people, their joy and their imagination completely gone, and eventually they would just... wither away. 

"Aye, like your--..." my father began, and then stopped himself. "Like your grandma, yeah? She'd seen him, said as much herself. Now look at her. I don't much do these ghost stories, but... aye, I think he's real."

I hadn't believed it since the first word, but I didn't let it show. Especially not when my father mentioned his mother -- I was a bullheaded kid sometimes, but never quite that heartless. That must've been when I was ten or eleven, and as children do, I batted the idea around in my head for a while, got bored and moved onto something else. Eventually, I moved on from that town altogether; said my goodbyes to my parents and my brothers and caught a train to university. 

The first time I visited was for Christmas. I stayed when my grandmother passed. I'd planned to return for the start of the next trimester, but with the funeral so close, I just shacked up in my parents' house and spent some much-needed time with them and my brothers. My father was always a stoic man, even in times of heartbreak, but it was plain to see this loss had affected him. Still, there wasn't much more I could do than just... be there. Let him know he was loved, and he could have all the time he needed. 

The thought only crossed my mind at the wake, when I was a couple drinks deep with my brothers. They'd made their own ways, one an electrician, the other having joined the Army. I raised the question to them like it was nothing.

"D'you guys remember that, uh... that story, about the guy in the top hat?"

"Nah," came Mark's reply. Blunt as ever. 

"What you on about?" was Jacob's. Inquisitive, at least.

"Go on, you must remember. At, ah... Uncle Darren's party for Halloween, yeah? We were all sat in this circle, telling ghost stories, right? And--..."

"Aye, aye, I remember now," Jacob nodded. Mark did the same, silent. "Was Aaron who told us it, yeah? Wonder where the bloody hell he got that from?"

I leaned inward. 

"His dad told him it, he said so himself. I never told you, but I went down and asked Dad and Uncle Darren about it."

Now they were interested. The snagged thread, pulling away.

"I don't know what the bloody hell they meant by this, but... they said Grandma *met* the man in the top hat. Like, face to face. Said that was why she... well, you know."

Mark stifled a chuckle as he sipped his drink. Jacob's brow furrowed, a pained look in his eye.

"So they think it was this... top hat bloke, that did that? Not, you know, the dementia?" Jacob mused out loud, and Mark heaved a sigh and shook his head.

I shrugged.

"Not really the time, is it, El? Jake? She's barely in the bloody ground, man."

Coarse as Mark could be, I supposed he was right. But the thread was pulled, and now that curiosity of mine was raring to yank it until I couldn't anymore. People hadn't seen the man in the top hat in years, maybe decades, but there had to be *something* to it. I didn't dare ask Dad, not in this state, and Uncle Darren was much the same. 

Lacking in options and enthusiasm and with a fair few drinks in me, I turned to the next best idea -- my Aunt Sarah, Uncle Darren's wife. I gave her my condolences, struck up small talk, and punctuated the question with a laugh.

"Did Uncle Darren ever talk to you about... like, a man in a top hat?"

Her face turned colder.

"How d'you know about that, pet?"

"Well," I started, shifting in my seat. "He told me when I was little, see. Told me that there was a man in a top hat who took little kids, that, ah... Grandma had seen him once. Sorry, I'm being a twat, I know, I'll just--..."

"No," Sarah stopped me. "No, he did. He talked about that man a fair bit, you know. Had nightmares about him sometimes, ever since his mam got sick. That's how I found out. He had to tell me what he was so afraid of, otherwise I'd never stop nagging. I don't know if he was telling the truth, he'd never seen the man himself... but he really did seem to believe."

She glanced across the room, at a framed portrait of Grandma.

"Better than that awful disease, I suppose. Better to have something to blame."

"Aye," I muttered, pulling Sarah into a hug. "Aye."

That night, I took a stroll. Bundled up warm on rain-slick streets, passing under blazing orange streetlamps as my breath fogged in the air. Part of it was just to clear my head, of course, but another part had a thought.

*Lonely children he likes best.*

So maybe, just maybe...

I knew the town like the back of my hand even after months away. I knew the best routes, I could put names and faces to each numbered door. Some had been renovated or shut down, but I still had the memory of what was meant to be there. There was the high street, the tavern where I had my first drink at the tender age of nine, the fish and chips shop my brothers would've gone to war to save if they had to. On the other end a row of cottages: one for the man who ran the chippy, another for the Greensboroughs, an old couple who'd lived there for decades before I was born--

Mrs. Greensborough -- *Marie* Greensborough -- was stood on her doorstep, fetching the post or some such I couldn't say. I almost waved to her and said hello, until I saw a blackness darker than the dark standing on the pavement outside her house. A solid black mass, just barely light enough to make out the contours of its shape against the streetlamps.

A thick, dark coat that stretched down to his ankles. Pristinely polished dress shoes and gloved hands politely at his sides. A scarf tightly bundled around his neck, thick and fluffy so that I could barely make out any features aside from skin. 

A top hat, at least two feet tall, balanced precariously on his head like nothing at all was unusual. 

Mrs. Greensborough hadn't seen him -- she was suffering from cataracts if I recalled right, and so shuffled back inside without a care. He eased her garden gate open and stepped across the threshold. I'm ashamed to admit that I stood and watched, transfixed in horror even as he crossed her garden in a few strides and dipped his head downward, letting his hat wedge in her doorframe. 

By the time I had crossed the length of the garden, he was already inside the house. I couldn't hear a struggle or a scream, and to my shame I stood there gawking for what must've been five seconds agonizing over what to do. I fumbled for my phone to call the police, but my hand stopped. Even if the police got here in five minutes, there was no telling what he could do in that time.

But I couldn't just walk away. Not now. So I grabbed a flowerpot from the garden, hefting its weight with both hands as I padded up to the doorway. Breath hitching, I eased it open.

Have you ever felt fear like cold water being poured down your collar? So cold that it hurts and petrifies you in every extremity? I thought I had, too. Now I know better. Now I have.

The top hat lay on the floor, everything but the brim limp like a tossed sock. His body was contorted over Mrs. Greensborough's, his hands holding her shoulders, her arms hanging limp at her sides. 

I apologise if my description of what comes next isn't up to snuff. I'll do my best, but if I picture it for too long, I just... I can't. I'm sorry.

Its head -- or whatever substitute it had -- was like a worm's mouth, with a set of six limbs like spiders' legs protruding from the neck, each at least two feet long. Each limb had taken hold of Mrs. Greensborough's head and grasped tight, running down her torso and twitching as her body shuddered and convulsed to keep her in place. A rope of pulsating flesh had stuck itself to Mrs. Greensborough's scalp, veins and membranous liquid running across as it glugged in rhythm with the twitching of Mrs. Greensborough's fingers. Its arms gripped her shoulders in the same rhythm, its fingers tensing and relaxing with each gulp it took. 

I said when I started writing this that I held the truth in the highest esteem. I've always believed that I would rather face a painful truth than be given a comforting lie. I'll give you the same courtesy now, and I know that if there is such a thing as Hell, for what I'm about to tell you, I deserve it.

I backed up out of the doorway, back down the garden path. Set down the flowerpot nice and gently. Scrambled around to the hedges bordering Mrs. Greensborough's garden walls and set my phone to record. I waited what must've been ten minutes before the thing in the top hat emerged, its hat twitching from underneath as it struggled to right itself.

You can hear on the recording as my breath hitches and I start to whimper. You can see it turn to look at me -- if it even has eyes to see. You can see it bring a hand to the brim of its hat, doff it in a practiced motion, and disappear down the street.

I hurried back inside once I knew it was gone, checked on Mrs. Greensborough and called 999. She hadn't the foggiest idea what had happened -- they assumed she had fallen and taken a nasty blow to the head, sustained some sort of brain damage. 

I left the next day, only mustered up the courage to ask about her when I next phoned my parents. They said she'd been diagnosed with dementia and put into hospice care. The people there loved to swap ghost stories, apparently. The man in the top hat was their favourite. One way or another, they all swore they'd seen him.

Some things you can't unlearn. Even if I lie awake at night and pray to God that I'll forget. Even if I dedicate every day of my life to doing as much good as I can. I wake up screaming with that sight in my head. I swear I can feel its limbs twitching against my back, holding me in place as it drinks deep of everything I am.

My mother was getting old. I suppose that's what prompted me to write this -- to finally share the burden with someone else who just might believe. She was old, and the disease ran in our family. That's all there is to it for everyone else.

And maybe one day I'll go back there, and I'll finally forget too.
