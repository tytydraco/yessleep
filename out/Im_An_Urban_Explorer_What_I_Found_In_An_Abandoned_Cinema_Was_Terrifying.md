I usually work alone, finding my way into abandoned buildings and looking for anything valuable. It's not a sustainable way to make money in these parts but I gotta pay rent somehow. About a week ago a friend of mine wanted to get into urban exploring and I showed him the ropes. He didn't do amazing but what can you expect from someone who's new to something you've been doing for years.

I should get to the point though; Yesterday, my best friend who I had taught mostly everything I knew, aka David, had run into a group of Urban Explorers like me who were going to look for valuables in an abandoned Cinema not too far from where I lived. My friend had mentioned me and well...they invited me to come with them and they were probably gonna ask me to join their group if I was good enough for them.

I never really worked with people despite it's dangers because I had never found anyone who was well, eager to do it. David? He only recently got into it, it's not like I'm gonna carry around dead weight while I struggle to make ends meet.

Now that I could possibly get a group of people who share similar interests, I felt excited, happy and a bit nervous.

The big thing on my mind was if I would have enough valuables at the end of it. Selfish, I know...but I'm not perfect, especially if i'm looking through abandoned buildings for valuables.

Though, At the end of this, I'll never work with anyone ever again...not after what happened that is.

It was about 6:30 PM, the sun had set and I had made my way to a place near the Abandoned Cinema to meet up with these people.

I was surprisingly early and my taxi got me here quickly. After about 30 minutes of waiting, people finally showed up;

A short and chubby guy climbed out of his truck. He had greasy, dark brown hair and his face was covered in pimples. He wore jeans and a white, greasy T-shirt and his friend quickly followed him out of the truck. The guy's friend was about my height, wore sunglasses despite it being dark and wore dark clothing and a hoodie that had a bunch of tools shoved in it's pockets.

A nice car pulled up and a girl who seemed to have recently gotten a buzz cut stepped out and as her car drove off, I realized she was a red head who had a skinny build but was taller than everyone here. She wore black sweatpants and a black shirt, similar to the guy with sunglasses but she also had a wrist watch and had a camera hanging from her neck.

We all introduced ourselves to each other; The short, chubby guy was Brian. The guy with sunglasses was "Big Q" (He wouldn't tell us his real name) and the red head was Rachel. 

The last one to show up was David, 40 minutes late but it's not like everyone else was much better.

"Why did you all take ATLEAST 30 minutes to get here". I asked, looking around at the people before me.

"Me And Big Q ran out of gas so we had to refill". Brian said, as if refilling gas would normally take 30 minutes.

"I don't know about anyone here but this is my first time doing this stuff and my parents weren't fans if you catch my drift". Rachel said, brushing the hair out of her eyes.

"And you, David"? I asked, giving a death glare to my friend.

"I...Ok, I forgot, jeez". David said, raising his arms up as if to defend himself from my stare.

I sighed, "Whatever. Shall we continue or start telling each other our star signs"? I asked sarcastically.

Without another word, everyone followed Big Q and Brian as they were the ones who invited everyone.

We made our way to some kind of sewer drain and as Big Q opened it up, everyone began descending into the pipes below.

It was dark and every step was followed by a loud creak of the nearby pipes. I was a bit worried the pipes would fall or crash down onto us but they held pretty well. Rachel took out a flashlight from her pocket along with Big Q and we made our way to a decently sized hole in the pipes and wall that was connected to it.

Me, Big Q, and Rachel were able to make our way through easily but David and Brian were having a bit of trouble. David had his leg stuck but with an odd angled tug we got him through but Brian was simply too fat to get through. We squeezed until he had bruise marks on him but it wasn't enough.

In the end we agreed he could look through the pipes and see if there's anything useful as well as be a lookout in case someone gets suspicious of the sewer drain being opened. (We had to keep the sewer drain open because Brian didn't have a flashlight and Big Q and Rachel were leaders not followers. I'm pretty sure it'd kill them to not take the lead. Though, me and David were fine with just hanging back and placing landmarks so we didn't get lost.

As we made our way through the hole in the wall, we fell down a couple feet into a hallway with tattered red rugs softening our fall.

The place looked like a check in and we saw several ticket booths with the glass shattered and vines somehow curling around everything near the leaking water fountains.

"These things don't have sunlight, how are they even alive"?! David asked, astonished at the thriving vine population.

"If we aren't careful they are gonna take over the world next". I joked, but was quickly jabbed by Big Q.

"Don't scare people, not when we are in abandoned places that are breeding grounds for paranoia. You want him running off when a light falls down and potentially getting lost? No? Good, because so far, funny man, David's been more helpful than you". Big Q lectured, making sure to lower his sunglasses, his green eyes broadcasting how serious he was.

I simply nodded and we started looking around for anything that could be sold for a decent amount of money.

Rachel went off on her own, probably to look in the bathrooms. Me and David looked around near the ticket booths and Big Q was fiddling with the doors to the cinema.

"Find anything"? David asked as he ripped a couple vines off of the shattered glass.

"Nah, but be careful of the glass, I almost scratched myself a couple times". I advised, reaching into one of the ticket booth compartments and pulling out a bunch of tattered tickets and a couple coins.

"Are those quarters"? David asked, turning to look at my hands.

"Pennies". I said in a dull tone as I stood up.

"Where are you going"? David asked, also standing up.

"I'm gonna go give these to Brian, I kinda feel bad for the guy". I confessed, Walking towards the hole in the wall.

David shrugged and got back to looking through the ticket booths.

I grunted as I ran and jumped, barely getting a grip on the hole in the wall and pushing myself up and through the hole, my skin screaming at me as I felt sharp metal scraping across my chest and arms.

I rolled into the pipe, narrowly missing a collision with my head and the edge of a pipe.

I got up, dusted off my knees and used the moonlight from outside to look around.

Brian was nowhere to be seen but I saw some footprints leading into the darkness ahead.

"He's probably searching for stuff in the pipes", I muttered to myself, following the footprints created from the dust and debris.

As I followed the footprints, I noticed a lot more dents appearing on the pipes the further I went. Brian  probably was messing around though or it could have been from some rats or something.

I found an intersection and went right, following the footprints as they became easier yet harder to see due to the light dimming and how recent the footprints were.

He must have been walking really slowly because it looked like he was trying to be quiet or something.

The thought then crossed my mind that maybe someone had noticed the open sewer drain and Brian was trying to make a sneaky escape and back stab us in the process.

Now I was pissed, and I picked up the pace, rushing through the pipes to find Brian.

Unbeknownst to me, the dents in the pipes were becoming bigger and more bizarre but I didn't notice that until the trail led to a dead end.

The pipe seemed to have been ripped in half because as my head peered out of the gaping hole that ripped through the pipe, I realized that on the other side of the gigantic hole in the pipe, the other side seemed to have no dents and no footprints. Though it was hard to see so I'm not sure if that was true or not.

As I was looking at the giant hole I heard something move below. I slowly looked down to see some sort of worm or centipede or something, I wasn't sure. It was white and bulbous and looked like an extremely bloated centipede. The only problem other than the giant insect was that where its face should have been was the top half of a human being which was only recognizable by the sunken eyes and open jaw dropped face. It had no teeth or hair and the thing was a grayish white color. It wore a half shredded shirt that had the word "Kitty" on it.

Disgusted and horrified, I threw up and alerted the monster to me. It quickly darted towards me, it's dark, crimson legs quickly gaining on me as I ran away from it. The pipes behind me were shredded and that's when I realized what had happened to Brian; he had probably been searching for valuables and made too much noise and that thing had rammed into him from outside of the vents and ripped him to shreds and left that 6 foot hole in the pipes.

As it gained on me, I dived into the hole in the pipes and fell down into the check in area. I yelled for the rest of the group and I heard them all talking in the cinema. I ran towards the now unlocked door that Big Q was messing with a while ago and ran inside, slamming the door behind me and facing the bewildered faces of Big Q, Rachel and David.

"dude why the hell are you screaming our names, are you trying to scare us"?! Raven asked, accusing me off the bat.

"N-No we need to go NOW"! I yelled in protest, grabbing David and motioning for the other 2 to follow me.

"Dude we are not gonna follow you". Big Q said, planting his feet in defiance.

"Please you have to listen to me, there's some kind of monster- it ate Brian and it's after me-". I rambled but was cut off.

"Enough with your bullshit, you've been trying to scare me and now everyone here". David said, looking at me, disappointed.

Big Q rolled his eyes as David lectured me and Raven walked over.

"Wait- Guys he might be serious, I saw the fear in his eyes as he ran in here-". Rachel said right as the monster rammed through the cinema wall, scooping up Big Q in its jaw.

That was when I realized how big "Kitty" was. It's mouth was gaping and huge, big enough to swallow Rachel in one bite.

Rachel stared in shock and David screamed as I grabbed them both and began running down the cinema stairs.

I watched as the chairs and seats were flung into the air as Kitty chased us, one of them nearly hitting me in the head and one almost tripping Rachel.

We made our way toward the stage and ran across the dark screen, hoping to confuse Kitty and it worked; Kitty slammed into the large screen and as the heavy screen fell forward, Me, David and Rachel made our way out of the room before we were crushed along with Kitty.

We all collapsed into the staff room we ran into.

"What the...hell...was that thing..."?! David asked, terrified.

"I don't know but we need to get the hell out of here before-" Rachel started but was cut off as Kitty let out a deafening roar and was destroying everything in the room behind us.

We all silently ran up the staff room staircase, headed towards the check in area.

It was flawless as Kitty was still rampaging in the cinema, we were already making our way through the hole in the wall.

"I'm going first". I said, taking a couple seconds to run and jump through the hole, with slightly more effort than last time due to the tension in the air.

Rachel followed suit and as David made his way through the hole, Kitty made its way back up to the check in and saw us escaping. David's leg got stuck on a piece of metal and he desperately tugged against it.

"David Hurry Up"! I yelled frantically, grabbing at David.

"Trevor, I don't wanna die". David said, grabbing onto my arm and tearing up.

"NO, you're not going to die- Rachel help me pull him up"! I yelled frantically.

Rachel tried helping but there wasn't enough room in the pipe to have two people helping David.

"David you're going to be alright, I promise"! I yelled as I tugged at David with all my might.

"Don't make promises you can't keep". David said, sniffling and sobbing silently.

"What?! David- NO! DAVID"!!! I screamed as I watched Kitty tug at David's legs, ripping him back through the hole and I watched as David was engulfed in Kitty's gaping maw.

"NOOOOOOOOOOO"!! I screamed hysterically, reaching for David as Rachel tugged me away and dragged me toward the sewer drain.

"LET ME GO- DAVID"!!! I screamed again, desperate for a response.

Rachel pulled me out of the sewer drain and quickly called a taxi and dragged me a couple blocks away from the Sewer entrance.

I was dead silent as rain poured down from above.

A couple minutes passed and Rachel slid me her phone number.

"I'm sorry I wasn't able to do more..." Rachel said mournfully, daring to look at my devastated face.

I stared at her wrist watch which showed 9:31 PM. All it took was 2 and a half Hours to lose my best friend.

"We can keep in touch, call the police-" Rachel tried to say but I cut her off.

"WHAT ARE THE POLICE GONNA DO?! WE WOULD ALREADY GET ARRESTED FOR DOING THIS AND THEY ARE GONNA BELIEVE US WHEN WE SAY THERE'S A DAMN MONSTER DOWN IN THE ABANDONED CINEMA?! WE DIDN'T EVEN GET ANYTHING OUT OF THIS"!!! I yelled in frustration at her.

Rachel was silent and as I put my hands in my pockets I felt the pennies from the ticket booth. Fat tears rolled down my eyes and as the taxi arrived, I pulled up my soaking wet hoodie and silently parted ways with Rachel.

This was all my fault, David would still be here if it wasn't for me. If I declined, he surely wouldn't have gone without me. We did everything together, after all.

I didn't get any sleep in my apartment and when I finally pulled out my phone to distract myself, all I could do was type this all out and post it here.

I don't know what to even do anymore but at this point, what is there to do? I can't even ask anyone for help... not the police, not my parents or family... All I have left is Pennies.

That's when I noticed the soaked piece of paper in my pocket with Rachel's phone number. 

"At least I have a stranger". I thought to myself, sighing and dialed her number.
