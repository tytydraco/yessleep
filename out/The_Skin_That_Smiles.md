I shouldn’t have gone down into the basement.

The sound started just after midnight—something wet dragging across the floorboards beneath my bed. At first, I thought it was the pipes, but when I pressed my ear to the floor, I heard breathing. Not mine. Not human.

I grabbed a flashlight and crept to the cellar door. The wood was swollen, the knob sticky under my palm, as if coated with syrup. When I pulled, the hinges screamed, and the stench rolled out—sweet, rotten, metallic.

The light cut through the dark. That’s when I saw the smear. A handprint. It was red, slick, fresh. Fingers dug furrows into the dust on the wall as though something had been dragged, clawing, begging.

I told myself to turn back. I told myself this wasn’t my problem. But the handprint was small. Child-sized.

My feet carried me down the stairs. Each step sank into something soft. I looked down, and bile rose in my throat—rats, dozens of them, bellies torn open, spilling black ropes of intestine, their jaws still snapping as if they hadn’t realized they were dead. One rat twitched, its spine cracked in half but its tiny hands clawing uselessly at the air.

The beam of my flashlight wavered, and then I saw it. A figure crouched in the far corner, its back rising and falling too fast. It was chewing. Loud, wet tearing sounds.

“Who’s there?” I whispered. My voice shook so badly it didn’t even sound like me.

It stopped. Slowly, its head twisted—not turned, twisted, until its chin pressed against its spine. The face… it wore someone’s skin. Too loose, like a mask tugged over raw meat. The eyes didn’t line up with the holes, and blood still dripped from the stitched edge where it had fastened the face to its own flesh.

I stepped back. My heel cracked down on something brittle. I glanced down and realized I had crushed a rib. A human rib. The floor wasn’t just rats—it was bones, fragments of skull, teeth scattered like dice.

It moved. Fast. Too fast. One moment crouched, the next a blur, slamming into me with enough force to knock the flashlight spinning across the floor. In the rolling beam I caught flashes of its body—patchwork skin, stitched and stapled, slick with blood that hadn’t dried.

Cold hands clamped on my chest, nails driving in. They didn’t just scratch—they hooked. I felt them tear through muscle and ribs with a sound like wet cloth ripping. My chest split open, hot blood spilling down my stomach in streams.

I screamed, but the scream cut off when its fingers wrapped around my lung. I felt it squeeze. The pain was white, blinding, as if my whole body was being crushed from the inside out. With a jerk, it yanked, and something tore free. I looked down just in time to see my own lung hanging from its fist, veins dangling like strings of fat.

It shoved the lung into its mouth and bit down. Wet, meaty sounds filled the basement. It chewed, blood spilling from the corners of the stolen mask’s lips, dripping down its chin. My blood. My flesh.

I collapsed, gasping, trying to hold the gaping hole in my chest closed with shaking hands. My vision swam. I thought I might pass out. Maybe dying would be better than feeling this.

But it wasn’t finished.

It dug again, tearing open my stomach. I felt my intestines slide against its fingers as it rooted through me like a butcher searching for the right cut. Something warm spilled across my thighs—a loop of my own guts slapping wet against my skin. It wrapped them around its arm like rope, tugging until more spilled out, stringing me open.

I begged. I don’t even know what I said—words slurred by blood filling my throat.

The flashlight rolled one last time, its beam catching the thing’s stolen face as it leaned close. My own reflection stared back at me from the mask, blood-slick and stretched, grinning wide with someone else’s mouth.

And then it whispered in my ear with my voice.
