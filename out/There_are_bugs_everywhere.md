I wouldn't say my place is all that dirty, sure it's messy but not dirty. I live on the fourth floor of an apartment building. It's relatively small but perfect for someone who lives alone. There is one room, one bathroom and it comes with an open kitchen. It's perfect and I've been living here for about a year, close to two.

I work from home so I don't tend to have much of a reason to go out, unless it's to keep sane and socialize with the outside world. I started working from home a couple months back and it's been great. I choose when to work and when to take breaks as long as I stay within the hours I'm supposed to work a day. It's a good job and I make enough to live. These days though my sleep schedule has been extremely off. I can almost sleep through the whole day and so I work mostly during the night. I've been trying to fix that mostly by staying up all night and day and going to bed at a normal time. 

The way my horrible sleep schedule started was on one particularly hot night. I kept tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep properly. The night was hot and humid, the blanket heavy, the bed uncomfortable, and the fan, loud and in my ears, only pushed the hot air around the room. I'd turn, flipping my pillow to the other side, the temperature the same on both sides. I wonder who cursed me that night. I wouldn't be surprised if I couldn't find my glasses that morning. 

So with a sigh I got up and went to my desk deciding to stay up for the rest of the night. Bringing the fan with me, I placed it down next to me as I took my seat. My glasses, still off, my phone now on, I scrolled mindlessly to pass the time. What felt like five minutes passed when out of the corner of my eye something blurry was on my lap. 

Grey and crawling on me I slapped it away.  I threw on my glasses and looked to the floor to see if it was there.  Nothing.  A shiver ran through me. probably wasn't enough to kill it so it ran off under something, my dresser, maybe the piles of clothes or random boxes I had on the floor.

 I got up taking minimal steps to my bed, deciding to just shrug off what happened, but it felt like it was still on me. Crawling up my legs to my thighs.  little legs, itching, and biting me. I'd rub my legs scratching at them to get the feeling off. It only multiplied though, on my feet between my toes, up my ankles to the calves, up to my thighs. I knew nothing was there, so after some moments of unrelenting scratching and picking, I'd stop and focus on something else to get my mind off the uncomfortable sensation. I was tired and hot, and sweating like crazy.  So maybe that's what magnified that situation so much.

I didn't sleep the rest of the night and stayed up till the morning. I decided to start my day at five with a cup of coffee forgetting everything that happened, except now with my glasses on I'd see them. crawling about like they owned the place. 

I was at my desk working and on the floor Silverfish, on the bigger side, would be freely crawling around. Multiple of them. To the point that I couldn't just ignore them, I'd have to kill a few. And god I hate killing those things.  The feeling of it squishing under my hand with a thin tissue separating us made me gag in disgust.  But the more I killed, the more I'd see them. I only saw about five of them at a time, but they moved around so much that it felt as though a lot more were hiding in my room. 

I had to ignore them. So I chose to just focus on my work, keeping my eyes on my computer. When lunch rolled around nothing was there, zero bugs crawled around the floor of my room.

When I came back from lunch, they got bolder, moving around closer to me, crawling up my chair. That's when I decided to pack up my things and move to the living room away from those disgusting things. 

I still decided to sleep in my bed that night. Luckily, the silverfish only stayed in the office area of my room, going nowhere near my bed. I felt safe in my bed like I already knew that they wouldn't be able to touch me there. 

I steer clear of that area now. working in the living room, sleeping in my bed, eating in the kitchen. If I need anything in that area I go over avoiding the multiplying bugs, getting what I need and not going back. 

It's not hard. I just ignore it. Sometimes I look over, accidentally making eye contact with one of those little things. I just look away disgusted and leave the room making sure to close the door keeping them in. At least it's just in that part of the apartment, I can live with that for now.
