The following is a chapter from a historical novella that chronicles real world events. It is the result of nearly 4 years of research and hard work. Some of the names have been changed

**Chapter 1: The Farm**

The long dwellers say in the time before the land had a name the patch was known by its barrenness. Nothing would or could take root in its cursed soil. Birds flew round it and even on a stormy day not a drop fell on parched earth. In fall the wind blew leaves round it and winter no snow fell upon it

The indigenous tribes had over generations learnt to avoid the patch. Songs and stories were passed from father to son of the place where a star fell. In some it was the resting place of a great monster. Cast out from the heavens for its evil deeds. However rebellious youths often full of hubris and looking for an outlet journeyed to the patch. Most turned back when they witnessed the dry black soil among the lush green. But a few did attempt to pass through the patch. They would quickly succumb to madness or illness

When European settlers arrived some of the indigenous people attempted to warn them of the patch. But the Europeans refused to listen. They as the rebellious youth where full of hubris. They believed that their god would protect them or vanquish the evil that blighted the patch. However after years of mysterious deaths and illness the patch was designated inhospitable; being held by the state until its supposed first known modern victims

The Byrne family, consisting of Thomas his wife Maeve and their five children originally arrived in Canada in 1893. The family had moved around for the first four years. However in 1897 Thomas purchased a small plot of land in Manitoba near the town Gare. The town famous for being an entry point for escaped slaves using the Underground Railroad. This also made the land in the town cheaper but the plot Thomas had bought wasn't ever to be sold. This is because a local town clerk had unknowingly amalgamated the patch into newly zoned farmland

One thousand and sixty six acres of the Byrne farm was arable. But there was a small patch that nothing grew in. After several conversations with the locals it was decided the family would avoid the patch focus on building a new life in Gare. By 1904, Patrick Byrne the oldest had died after falling ill in Ontario. But the farm produced enough that the family lived a modest life

In the fall of that year the family began to hear music. According to the testimony of the sole surviving Byrne at night they could hear singing emanating from the patch. At first they attempted to ignore it but it grew louder as the nights colder. But strangely she claims she can't remember the tune or the words of the song. Her father, Thomas began to become erratic and would lash out at the family for the smallest perceived slight. His anger towards her the greatest as she had begun to see boy in town. The colour of the boy's skin a particular grievance Thomas Byrne held against his daughter

It would be this forbidden love that would save Edith Byrne's life on the night of December 17th 1904. After dinner she would sneak out to see her future husband, Arnold Gomez. What occurred that night we may never know but when Edith returned home she found it empty. In a panic she ran to the neighbours and informed them that her family was missing. A team of six men was soon created to search for the missing Byrnes

Below is the testimony of Philip Morison the leader of the group to the police during the investigation into the deaths the following year:

*"The Byrne girl showed up at Henry's door half crazed saying she couldn't find her family. So he sent his boy, Peter to get me and some of the boys out there to help him. It was still dark out so we had some torches. We started at the house but there wasn't any sign that there had been a fight or nothing. So Greg (Abbott) and I went east while the others went other directions. I'll be honest I'd heard stories of that place when I was a boy but it still freaked me out when I heard them singing. I thought I was losing my mind but Greg heard it too. It was Tom, his wife and kids singing some strange song. We called out but they didn't answer. We walked towards the voices and after a couple of minutes we found the boys. They were, or what was left of them was by the patch" -* ***Philip Morison January 11th 1905***

Abbott and Morison's reactions to discovering the bodies of the Byrne children where heard by the other men, including Henry O'Keefe. They would arrive shortly after but Mr O'Keefe wouldn't talk of what he witnessed until nearly a decade later. He would give an interview to the local paper, the Gare Gazette about his experience three weeks before his death.

Below is that interview with Arjun Khan in 1913

***Arjun Khan (Gare Gazette):*** *So after you heard them (Abbott and Morison) what you do?*

***Henry O'Keefe***: *I and Kenny (Kenneth O'Keeffe) ran towards the screams. I thought maybe they had been attacked. When we got there we saw the boys. I still can't get them out my head. Their little bones coming out the skin, sorry (crying)*

***Arjun Khan (Gare Gazette):*** *It's alright Henry, take your time*

***Henry O'Keefe:*** *They used to play with Peter and now they were just. So I and Kenny see the boys and Greg and Phil are screaming their heads off. Kenny goes up to Phil and starts trying to calm him down. The two of them had been best friends for years so it works and we start trying to get them to tell us what's happened. Phil says they heard singing so the followed it there and found the boys. I ask if they've seen Tom and Maeve and they say no, and that's when we hear it too*

***Arjun Khan (Gare Gazette):*** *The singing?*

***Henry O'Keefe:*** *Yes*

***Arjun Khan (Gare Gazette):*** *Do you remember what they were saying?*

***Henry O'Keefe***: *No, I can't even remember the tune but I can tell you that the boys where singing along*

***Arjun Khan (Gare Gazette):*** *The Byrne boys*

***Henry O'Keefe:*** *Yes, and Maeve and Tom. Maybe we lost our minds, I don't know. But I think it was Phil who starts calling out to Tom. But it didn't change anything they just kept singing*

***Extract from the Henry O'Keefe interview February 21st 1913***

The group would stay out in the field for a few more minutes before the singing would stop. They would wrap the remains of Douglas and Nickolas Byrne in blankets. The boys would be buried behind the Byrne family home a few days later. Thomas and Maeve Byrne would never be seen again. Edith would inherit the farm but never return to it alone. She would start living with the Abbotts and move in with her husband in 1907. After this incident the patch disappeared and it is nearly impossible to know where exactly it was. Today (2023) the Byrne Farm is owned by an international corporation. However the incident at the Byrne farm would be the start of a series of events that would crescendo in 1937
