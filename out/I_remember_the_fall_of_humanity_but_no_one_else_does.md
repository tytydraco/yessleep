The moment that our so-called protectors collectively bit the apple of indulgence. The first gunshot, then the gunfire and the deafening booms of the bombings. The rapture was silent, a press of a button. Evacuations. Crowds of people crushed together like cattle to slaughter. A cough, then disease. After the plague wiped out all the livestock and the napalm burnt all the crops, people became desperate for food. Canned goods and God’s love share one thing in-common: they're finite. Rumours of packs of cannibals first started then, I think. Packs of residual survivors bleed out into trios, then duos, and then loners. Earthquakes, fires and the screams. Oh, the screams. How the choir of God’s unloved wailed as all the devils broke loose and danced among their brothers and sisters of sin. War, plague and famine were replaced with their brethren, death. Death, dying, suicide. Silence. I’ve always hated the noise.  Memories. Memories that run through me, fresher than my blood. Memories that don’t exist.

  


Whenever I see someone, a person. Family, friends, foes, it doesn't matter -I can’t see what they actually look like. I can remember what they looked like before. But in the present day? All I can see is a body. A cadaver of a great tribulation. They don’t move like a person would. They just appear. Just staring at me. Jaws agape, eyes hollowed out. Rotted. Silent. I can’t hear what anyone says anymore. All they do is look at me, in stunned silence. I have so many memories of what people were like before. Busy, busy, busy. Loud. And messy. Disgusting fucking animals. Loud and overwhelming and messy memories. Memories that play out before me. Reality. That's what I’ve been told -in writing. It always pops up around me in colourful little sticky notes. “You’re here now.” “Live in the moment.” “Remember, we're here with you.” Remember. I remember. I have to remember. 

  


Whenever I saw a body from the fall, I remember wondering about what noises it would have made. Did it cry? Did it grovel and beg for forgiveness before succumbing to its last kiss with our final lover? Did it scream? Was it scared at its demise? Or was it angry, for being untimely ripped from the womb of the earth? Did it love? There were always small clues: heart lockets, rings, wallets with crudely scrawled ‘I love you’s in plastic ID slots. Echoes of life. Living. Living right now. This is all right now. I need to focus on now. 

  


Now, I think if you’d shown past me -or is it the future me? The me that was, before, what lies before me now, I would have felt upset. It's a naked female lying in the grey snow, bloody and bruised. Her pale skin with hues of magnificent purples, blues, reds and browns makes her a beacon in this ashy, unreal world. The only indication that she’s alive is the occasional condensation clouds from her breathing, it’s like a smoke signal. She’s basically begging to be found. As I stand behind a tree across from the remainder of the tree line, I try to see if she’s alone. I don’t want an encounter with whoever left her in this state, Lord knows I don’t have the strength to fight. Slowly I heel-toe through the sludgy debris of the broken tar of the road. Earthquakes have caused small chasms to form everywhere. Fools error to think that they’re small enough to be ignored. One misstep and it’s a broken foot or worse, you’re stuck. No one keeps a lame horse around for very long.   

  


Closer. Quieter. Slower. I can see more details about her now. She’s thin, really thin. Every single one of her vertebrae pulsates and bulges against her skin, in sync with her shallow breaths like worms trying to breach from their fleshy prison. She’s turned away from me, I think. It's hard to tell as her long brown hair is wrapped around her face and neck like a thready face-hugger trying to squeeze out her last breath. From her waist down she lays in a crimson pool, her inner thighs still wet from the fresh blood oozing out of her. Fuck I can basically smell the blood on her now.  Now. Now. Now, it was all in the past. The past that didn’t happen. It didn’t happen. 

  


I needed to act before it was too late. She couldn't make any noise. I got on my hands and knees, and a chunk of debris caught my attention. Jagged and blackened tar with small pebbles erupting to the outside like shards of shrapnel. It fit perfectly in my hand, the end came to a point like a spear tip. Is this how Cain felt before he killed Abel? Is the adrenaline I felt then the same as the first murder? Were his hands shaking in anticipation too? Did his thoughts race with ecstasy at what he was about to do? Like the tiger I stalked –then I pounced- and like the goat, she bleated. God, shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. With every strike my body contorts back and snaps forward, to then arch back and strike again. With a thunderous crack, her skull finally splat open, spilling out its grey, pink and red matter. Small slimy globs of her brain covered my hands and her blood flowed like a fountain. I knew she was dead and yet my body uncontrollably and continuously bashed that once beloved skull into a pulp.   

  


The world is full of silence. The bodies never speak. Never make noise, and yet I stare at the bitch waiting for a whimper, a yell, a scream, anything. Silently she stares through me, her eyes once a deep brown, now blending into the disturbed ashy snow-dirt around her. Sitting on top of her, I look down at what lies beneath me. An additional body added to the unnamed and countless others. A statistic. As my body stops shaking, my breathing stabilizes and the ecstasy fades from my veins, I can finally do what I want to do. I bring my accessory -my tool- up to my face and admire my work. Blood glistens on every protrusion and crevasse of the rock, like itself is oozing out to its death. Like an old- current clock, the rhythmic drips of the blood brings me an odd comfort. Tap. Tap. Tap. It echoes and reverbs around the trees. It’s like I’ve given life by taking another. Ironic. Symbolic, almost. 

  


I lift up the rock as if it were a once beating heart and begin to lap up the pulverized brain matter, like a dog. Like the fucking dog that I am. You did what you had to do for survival. But that wasn’t real. No one else remembers it, remember? The metallic taste colonised my mouth once more, small hunks of meat wiggled between my teeth like maggots trying to burrow into my gums. I sucked any last remnants off the rock before I discard it. I plunged my hand into her skull grasping at the paste of her brain matter and promptly began to devour it. *Animal. You sick, sick animal.* I can almost hear it. I can almost hear them. Hear her. 

  


I admired my meal in silence. A young woman with so much promise. I would say early 20s Maybe older, maybe younger, they all are the same. A diamond face, high cheekbones, roman nose and her eyes. Even with her face blackened and bloodstained, her eyes remain with an element of kindness. Doe eyes, I think what they’re called. Christ, she was beautiful. I leaned down and gently kissed her slightly blue lips, and to my surprise, they were still warm. I continued to kiss her still lips before moving down to her neck, her skin was soft and delicate like the petals of a rose. My left hand subconsciously ran down from her face to her neck and then to her breasts, the right went further down her body. Must be muscle memory. 

  


Memory. Remember. Memories that run through me, fresher than my blood. Memories that don’t exist. A memory so embedded deep into my soul, that it runs in my veins and corrupts every fiber of my being. From the rise until the fall, of memories that didn’t happen, but I remember. I remember. Echoes of memory, echoes of life, carved into my bones and plastered over every cellwall. But since no one else remembers it; then surely humanity didn’t exist at all.
