The guy showed up right on time, which was a little surprising considering how late I'd called. My car wouldn’t start, and the cold snap in the middle of winter wasn’t doing me any favors. AAA had recommended a mechanic in town who did house calls, so when I saw the truck pull into my driveway, I was relieved.

He was tall, lanky, and wore a navy-blue jumpsuit with a patch on the chest that read “Rick’s Auto.” His truck had the same name printed on the side, so I didn’t think much of it. I opened the door as he walked up with his toolbox, his hands shoved into his pockets like he was shielding them from the cold.

"You called about the car?" he asked, voice low and gravelly.

"Yeah, thanks for coming so late," I said, stepping aside so he could come in. My garage was attached to the house, and I led him through the kitchen toward the door that opened into it. Something about the way he walked behind me made me uneasy. His boots thudded heavily against the hardwood floor, each step deliberate. But I shook it off—probably just tired nerves.

We got into the garage, and I gestured to my car, a beat-up old sedan that had served me well until now. "It's not starting. I think it might be the battery or the alternator. I’m not sure."

Rick—or whoever he was—nodded and set down his toolbox next to the hood. He didn’t say much, which I appreciated at first. I figured he was just focused on his work. He popped the hood and leaned in. That’s when I noticed something odd.

His jumpsuit looked...off. The patch on his chest wasn’t stitched in properly. It was frayed at the edges, like it had been hastily glued on or something. And when he leaned forward, I could see the faint outline of another name under it, one that had been scratched off.

“Uh, do you actually work for Rick’s Auto?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He froze for a moment, his hands buried under the hood. Then he slowly straightened up and turned to face me. His face was blank, but his eyes—those dark, glassy eyes—felt like they were drilling holes into me.

“Why do you ask?” he said, his tone calm, almost too calm.

I swallowed hard, trying to think of an excuse. “Oh, uh, no reason. I just—uh, I’ve never used them before, so I just wanted to make sure.”

He smiled then, but it wasn’t friendly. It was the kind of smile you see right before something terrible happens. “You don’t trust me?”

“No, no, I didn’t mean that,” I said quickly, taking a step back.

He turned away and fiddled with the engine again, but I could feel the tension in the room, thick enough to choke on. My eyes darted to the toolbox he’d brought. It was scratched up, dented, and looked like it had been dragged through hell. It didn’t match the pristine truck in my driveway.

I needed to get out of there. “I’m just gonna grab my phone,” I said, forcing a laugh. “You know, in case I need to call AAA back.”

He didn’t respond. He didn’t even look at me. I backed out of the garage and into the kitchen, my heart pounding. Once I was out of sight, I grabbed my phone from the counter and pulled up the number for AAA. Before I could hit dial, a voice came from behind me.

“Looking for this?”

I spun around, and there he was, holding my car keys. How had he gotten in so fast?

“I thought you said your car wouldn’t start,” he said, tilting his head. His tone was casual, but his grip on the keys was anything but.

“It—it doesn’t,” I stammered.

He stepped closer, and I stepped back, bumping into the counter. “Funny,” he said. “Because it started just fine when I turned the ignition.”

My blood ran cold. That didn’t make any sense. He hadn’t even been under the hood long enough to fix anything.

“Who are you?” I blurted out, my voice shaking.

He grinned, wider this time, his teeth yellow and uneven. “Just a guy who saw an opportunity.”

I bolted for the door, but he was faster. His hand clamped down on my wrist like a vice, and he yanked me back. My phone slipped from my hand and clattered to the floor.

“You really should be more careful about who you let into your house,” he hissed.

That’s when I saw it—sticking out of his toolbox. A knife, its blade smeared with something dark. My stomach lurched as I realized it wasn’t grease.

I kicked and screamed, managing to break free for just a second. I grabbed the nearest thing I could—a cast iron skillet from the stove—and swung it with everything I had. It connected with a sickening crack, and he dropped to the floor, groaning.

I didn’t stick around to see if he was out cold. I grabbed my phone, ran outside, and called the police from the driveway.

When they arrived, they found him still in the kitchen, dazed but alive. Turns out, he wasn’t a mechanic. He wasn’t even from town. The truck? Stolen. The patch on his jumpsuit? A fake.

I never found out what his plan was, and honestly, I don’t want to know. All I know is that I’ll never let a stranger into my house again.
