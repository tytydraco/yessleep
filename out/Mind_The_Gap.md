Do you know what a foley artist is? When you’re watching a TV show or a movie and you hear a character open a door, hit a light switch, slam a glass down on a table, plunge a knife into another person, etc., you’re hearing the work of a foley artist. They recreate the desired sounds for a scene and insert them into the soundtrack during the editing process. Very little of what you hear while watching film or TV was recorded at the same time as what you’re seeing, most of it is added after the fact. If you ever want to take yourself out of a show or movie, focus in on the little sounds that you would usually take for granted: suddenly they will begin to sound very blatantly artificial.

I’m not someone who would usually notice stuff like that. I wouldn’t call myself a film buff, and I’ve never worked in the entertainment industry, but I do enjoy a good cheesy sitcom now and again. When I saw that the new show “Mind The Gap” was made available on streaming last week, it looked right up my alley. I had no intention of analyzing the sound work for the show then, and now I wish that I had just skipped it and watched “Friends” again for the hundredth time.

I got home from work at around eight o’clock last Wednesday. I kicked my shoes off, made myself a quick and dirty struggle meal, then plopped down on the couch in front of the TV. The first episode of “Mind The Gap” was queued up and ready to go, and as I pressed play I took a scoop of the food in my bowl. The metal spoon scraped against the edge of the ceramic, making a sound that would have annoyed my girlfriend Lauren if she had been there when it happened. I missed her a lot.

The episode began with a silly theme song and then got right into the characters making stupid jokes in their apartment. It was so cliche that it even had a laugh track, but I enjoyed that kind of thing. It was nostalgic to me, and even comforting in a way. I was enjoying myself quite a bit, until about ten minutes into the episode: that was when I noticed something that tore all of those feelings away from me and replaced them with paranoia and creeping dread.

One of the characters, Dave, was eating cereal out of a bowl while his friend Bob was monologuing about some dumb idea for an invention that he had come up with. What disturbed me was that when Dave put his spoon into his bowl, it made the exact sound that my spoon had made in my bowl. I know that this sounds ridiculous, but it was the exact same sound, I was certain. I paused the show for a moment, thought about how strange it was that the sounds were seemingly identical, then quickly collected myself. I convinced myself that I must just be tired, that the sounds weren’t really exactly the same, that would be impossible. After all, how different could the sounds of two different spoons scraping against two different bowls really be? They were sure to sound at least somewhat alike. I shook off that uneasy feeling and pressed play again.

Then, a character named Sarah opened the door of the apartment and walked into the room with Bob and Dave. I paused the show again and stood straight up. The sound of the door, and the sound of the footsteps on the floor, were precisely the same as the sound of my apartment door and my footsteps when I walk through the entrance. I walked over to my door, opened it, then shut it. The sound was exactly the same. My hands were trembling as I picked up my shoes to put them back on my feet. I walked outside the door, shut it, opened it, and walked through the entrance as I had just an hour or so before. The sounds were completely identical to what I had heard in the show, down to the wavelength. It wasn’t possible, but I was sure of what I’d heard. I felt a pang of terror and decided that I had better call it an early night and go to bed before I could think about it any further, and so I did.

Before I went to sleep, I texted Lauren with shaking hands, asking how she was doing and how long it was going to be until she came home. She was studying abroad for the summer and I hadn’t seen her in two months. She replied with a voice message: “I’m going to be staying here for a while. I got a job voice-acting, can you believe it? They say I’ve got a real knack for it! We can talk about it later.”

I couldn’t believe it, when was I going to see her again? Why wouldn’t she talk to me about this first? This was all just too much for me, so I decided to put my phone down and I tried to get some well-needed rest.

When I got home from work again the next day, I repeated the same routine and started “Mind The Gap” from where I had left off. I laughed to myself a little when I thought about the night before: what had I been thinking? So what if the sounds were similar to my own apartment? It was just a TV show. Maybe the people who made the sound effects lived in an apartment very similar to mine, and used utensils and bowls like the ones that I owned. So what?

Then all of the feelings from the previous night came rushing back, as I became disturbed again at a scene toward the end of the episode. Dave was sleeping soundly in bed, and his alarm clock started playing a song off of the radio to wake him up. There was nothing unusual about this on its face, but the song choice made me shudder. It was the end of the second chorus of “Black Hole Sun”, leading into the bridge: which was exactly what my alarm clock had played to wake me up that morning. What were the odds? All of this seemed too much to be coincidence, but what could it mean? Although I was getting frightened again, I persevered and let the second episode begin when the first ended.

What came next was truly unbelievable. I know that up until now you probably think that I’m just going crazy, but how could you explain this? It was a scene where a yet unseen character named Emily, Bob’s ex-wife, left a voicemail message for him on his phone. Emily said in Lauren’s voice, exactly how she had said it to me in her voice message, “I’m going to be staying here for a while. I got a job voice-acting, can you believe it? They say I’ve got a real knack for it! We can talk about it later.”

It was the exact same line of dialogue, only coming out of my TV instead of my phone. What was going on? How was this possible? Horror took hold of me, then rage. What else could be going on, except that there were microphones in my apartment recording all of the sounds in the place? They must have recorded my bowl, my door, my footsteps, and even my girlfriend’s voice message without my knowledge or consent. This was an unprecedented invasion of privacy, and I wasn’t going to let it stand for one minute longer.

I rose up and dashed around my apartment, throwing furniture around and tearing at the walls with a hammer. It was just as I suspected: there were small electronic devices concealed behind appliances and in small cracks in the walls and ceiling that I had never thought to examine closely before. I swung my hammer hard and tore apart the place for the better part of six hours, leaving no stone unturned in my search. I tore the devices from their wiring, and they emitted a screeching feedback noise until I smashed them to pieces. There were dozens of them, everywhere! You want to record my life and put it in a TV show? I’ll show you. The sounds of my home and my life are not something to be repurposed for some idiotic sitcom, I am a real human being who is entitled to his privacy!

At last, when my apartment was barely more than rubble and every last device had been utterly destroyed, I slumped back into the couch, triumphant. I was covered in perspiration and breathing very heavily. Then I realized something: I couldn’t actually hear myself breathe. I couldn’t hear anything. I beat my hands against the couch cushions, but it made no sound. I got up and walked around, but I heard no footsteps. Had I gone deaf? I grabbed the TV remote and pressed play to see if I could hear the show, and I could! How was it that I couldn’t hear the sounds of my actual life, but I could hear the TV?

In the show, Bob played another voicemail from his phone. It was Lauren’s voice again, as Emily, saying this: “Did you think that they were microphones? No, silly! They were speakers!”

I can’t hear anything but my phone and the TV now. Nothing I do in real life produces any noise, no matter how hard I try. I haven’t left my apartment since then. What if I still can’t hear anything when I step outside?
