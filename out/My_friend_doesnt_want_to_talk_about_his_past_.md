My friend , Joseph , was a very respected person in our society . He was a very kind person who was blessed with a beautiful girlfriend named Jasmine . 

But the thing that used to bother me is that never mentioned his past , he never talked about his parents or grandparents which was odd . I realised that they must have been really abusive towards him so that's why he didn't want to talk about them , and i understand that people have private lives and many people are not comfortable with sharing their past ... But he didn't even tell me about where he used to live or which high school he used to attend . I talked to his girlfriend that if he knew something and she was also as clueless as I was .

The only thing he told me was that he moved here when he was 21 , as if there was no records of him before he turned 21 , which was odd but i decided to not torture my friend anymore with these type of questions about his past 


Now I was a normal day , I was sitting at some watching wwe when I got a call from Jasmine , she sounded ... A bit odd , it wasn't the usual butterfly Jasmine I used to talk to , she sounded a bit scared ... Then she told me something that gave me goosebumps

She told me that she was sitting in her room when he heard some noises coming from the bathroom , she told me that it sounded like someone was cutting something with a knife , she tried to ignore it at first but then she decided to go investigate

She opened the bathroom door and saw Joseph , knife in hand completely covered in blood , covered in blood of a lifeless dog , he had killed a dog , he then turned towards her with a wicked smile , still holding the knife . She screamed as loud as she can and ran towards her bedroom ,  the last thing she saw before locking he door was Joseph sprinting towards her like a maniac , carrying the knife in an attacking position

He kept banging on the door , sometimes stabbing the door with the knife .

Shd then picked up the phone and called me ,

I had known him for years , i have even stayed with him sometimes and i have never seen him behave this way , I never knew that he had some kind of mental illness 

I comforted her and told her that I was going to his house right now and see what was going on , i was scared as hell but her life was in danger and I had to do something , I was not a very big guy but I used to learn martial arts when I was a kid , so I was not very scared about my own safety but I still took a pocket knife with me just in case 

I went to his house which was like 5 minutes away , I tried to call Joseph but he was not picking up , then i tried to call jasmine and she didn't pick up either , now i got extremely worried . Did he succeed in breaking the door , did he do something bad to her , what caused him to react this way 

I finally reached his home. the door was wide open . The inside of the house looked like hell , there was blood everywhere , the tv was smashed , the table was broken and the windows were shattered 


But no signs on Joseph , did he run away and left the door open , that's wasn't my priority , I went upstairs to check on jasmine , my heart racing faster with evey step i took , when I was upstairs outside of Jasmine's door , i called her , multiple times , but no answer , then I tried to open the door and it was unlocked . There were no signs of her anywhere , the only window in the room was smashed and written with red paint on the walls of the room was “ don't worry about my past " ....

 It took me some time to realise that it was not red paint , I was actually fresh blood , i wanted to throw up but I couldn't 
I checked every room , in the bathroom i saw a dog , or the body of a dog , there was no head 

Then I went to the kitchen , I saw all of the kitchen knives missing , the usually had 3-4 knives with them in the kitchen both for cooking reason and also for emergency situation , and written of the walls was “ forget about us " 

Then i wented inside his bedroom , I saw a note on his bed , it read 

“ I know everything you two did , i know your secret , take this as some kind of punishment you got for what you did to me , I wanted to brutally end both of you but i guess Jasmine's has to be the one the get the brutal ending . And don't worry , i won't come for you ,  i will let your own demons get you  " 

And written on the walls was “ NEVER ASK ME ABOUT MY PAST " 


I quickly burned the letter before calling the police , I needed some time to think privately which I was not going to get if I was a major suspect . 

Now I'm sitting in my room writing this , contemplating what should be my next move , i have a bottle of poison beside me but I'm not sure if I have to heart to carry it out , help me oh lord , may God have mercy on me
