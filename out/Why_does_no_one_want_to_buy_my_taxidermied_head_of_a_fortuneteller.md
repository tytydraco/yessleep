Her name was Ghanima, she was a psychic from Lithuania. And now her severed head is making me do unspeakable things.

Let me explain.

\*\*\*

As an older woman, Ghanima moved to America and worked tarot and crystal balls for a long time, acquiring many famous clients whose names I can't disclose.

Her wealthiest client put her up in a mansion for her last years, and promised to fulfill her deepest desire after death. 

And yes, as you may have guessed, her deepest desire was to have her head severed, dried, stuffed and preserved as a trophy on a wooden mantle.

(How the client actually found someone to perform this service is beyond my knowledge.)

Then after many years, the hermit-like client grew old, and died without heirs–resulting in an estate sale that I went to visit; where I bought some 19th tennis racquets, a collection of merlots, and of course, Ghanima’s taxidermied head.

At the time I thought: *how can I resist?*

\*\*\*

The auctioneers labelled it as a fake ‘joke item’, a prank piece of art. But after I made the purchase, the dealer gave me a handwritten contract that explained it was 100% real.

“We had to label it as a farce, otherwise it would have been illegal to sell. But trust me, what you now own is a *real human head*.”

I was thrilled.

You see, I make a living buying and selling antiques. I own a small shop and several storage units. This head would be by far the most bizarre, thought-provoking object I had ever come to possession. It was the sort of thing I could prop up in the back of my store and generate some real buzz.

You have no idea how far word-of-mouth goes among antique collectors. People loved my scary-looking paintings, creepy dolls and the like. But a real human head? Now *that* would be the talk of the town. 

Or so I thought.

 \*\*\*

The night after purchasing it, I opened the crate and placed the head on my coffee table.

Ghanima's eyes were replaced by the most pearlescent, shining fake pupils I had ever seen. And her skin, although dry, still appeared fresh, as if she had just been wiped by a towel moments ago. 

You might say she looked like a “witch”, but there was more to it than that. Although she had a  hooked nose and bushy eyebrow, there was also a well earned reverence to her wrinkles and petrified smile. You can tell she had lived her life exactly as she had always wanted to.

She had everything under her control.

I know because the moment I touched her hair, her lips moved, and she seized *literal* control of me.

“You're mine now.”

\*\*\*

I can only describe it as being under a *spell.* 

My body froze from top to toe, each muscle became as rigid as stone. And then, as soon as I had petrified, a warm wind *melted* my ice-like rigidity, and I relaxed into a hunched over pose with knees buckling inwards.

“How good it feels to be back.” Her voice came out of my mouth and gave a small cackle. She patted my pot belly and tugged at my goatee “Yes, this will have to do. This will have to do *indeed*.”

\*\*\*

I watched helplessly from the back of my mind as my possessed self pulled all the raw meat from my fridge and left it rotting on my dining table.

I gathered all the pillows I owned in my house and assembled them in a big pile. Tearing holes in the center of each one. 

Without hesitation, my possessed self peeled all the clothes off of my body, and started pulling herbs like rosemary and thyme out of the kitchen drawers. The herbs were crushed by hand, and rubbed along my chest and arms. Dried dill was liberally applied all along my lower half…

After doing this, I sat back down face to face with Ghanima’s preserved head. She spoke to me like she was speaking to a dear old friend.

“I promised many rich and powerful clients of mine a taste of immortality,” Ghanima smirked, clearly very pleased with herself.

“Over the next several moons, many old spirits will be sharing you. They will all take turns as I promised them. Many turns they will take. 

“Once everyone has had their turn—\*including myself—\*you will be allowed to have a turn back in your old self. It is only fair as a recompense.

“So my dear child, please sit back and relax. Try to enjoy your many new personas. You’ll be getting your old body back in a few short months.”

A piercingly sharp, *cold wind* shot down my throat and through my arms. I could hear laughter behind my eyes.

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

\*\*\*

I’m not going to recount each ghastly act my body was made to do.

After I regained control, it took me weeks to stitch together some semblance of my old self in this new emaciated husk.

I’ve lost fingers. 

I’ve lost patches of skin.

I’ve lost many other things I do not wish to explain.

And even though I wanted to torch the witch’s head with every fiber of my being. My own hands still betrayed me and would not harm a single gray hair on her taxidermied scalp.

“If you want to get rid of me, *sell me,”*  she said. “Greed is the strongest magic there is. Any exchange of currency in the name of Ghanima will bind me to the new owner.”

\*\*\*

And so, here I am, posting an advert for an occult item on a page of the internet where people seek this sort of stuff out.

**For Sale:** *Taxidermied head of an old fortune-teller.Although almost 150 years old, this head is still remarkably well preserved with many stunning details that still appear lifelike. Wrinkles, dimples, moles—there’s even a gold earring in her left ear.*

*Once purchased, never look her in the eyes or touch her. If you convince an enemy of yours to purchase this gift, their life will be absolutely cursed and devastated. Very useful as a weapon. This is a truly priceless artifact*
