What I’m about to share happened to me ten years ago. Even though so much time has passed, the horror of that night is still deeply etched in my memory—I doubt I will ever forget it.


I was around ten years old, spending a rainy Saturday night watching movies. Since it was fairly late (around 11 PM, maybe?), my mom came out of her room and started scolding me to go to bed. I turned off the TV and went to my room, which was always the coldest in our house.

Before I go any further, I should mention the layout of our home. When you enter, my room is on the right side of the hallway, and the kitchen is on the left. Back then, I was a scaredy-cat, so I always kept my door open at night, which meant I could clearly hear any sounds from the hallway or kitchen.
I got into bed and lay there for about ten minutes, unable to sleep but keeping my eyes closed. I was thinking (though I can’t remember about what) when I suddenly heard footsteps in the hallway. Well
I assumed it was my mother; she had mentioned having a headache earlier, so I figured she was looking for some painkillers. We had a cabinet in the kitchen where she sometimes left ibuprofen, so it made sense.
But then, the footsteps started getting closer.

At first, I wasn’t alarmed. I knew there were also painkillers in my room, so I assumed she was coming to get them. At that time, the only people home were me, my mother, and my four-year-old brother—who I was sure was fast asleep.  (So it couldn't really have been him).

Before entering my room, you had to step over a thick wooden threshold attached to the doorframe. So whenever it was stepped on, I could hear it right away. But from the sound of their steps, I instantly knew—it wasn’t my mother.
Whoever or whatever it was moved slowly, creeping toward my bed. Then they stopped, Just standing there.

I held my breath, trying to stay as still as possible, pretending to be asleep while internally panicking. Something felt deeply wrong and my gut told me not to open my eyes.

Then, just as suddenly as they had come in, they started walking away. I honestly felt relived. Too soon, though—because just as I let out a breath (a little too loud for my liking), the footsteps rushed back. Fast. They stopped again, right next to my bed.
At that point, I started praying. Begging to make it through the night, to not have a heart attack from sheer terror.

Then, the thing started moving again—but not leaving. Instead, it began pacing. Walking back and forth, circling in my room. The only way I can describe it is that it felt like they were deliberately staying close, as if they were waiting for something.
Outside, the rain started puring harder and my prayers became intensified too.

Suddenly, the thing in my room started sprinting. Running in circles and I started wondering why my mom hadn’t woken up from all the footsteps. I was also debating if i should just open my eyes and see what was there but ngl, all that fear just paralized me, i was pretty much shitting my pants. 
Then, i heard a loud crash from outside, followed by the sound of the thunder. And just like that—everything stopped.

There was silence for a brief moment before I heard a sudden rush out of my room. Then—what sounded like plates (or glass maybe) shattering in the kitchen. A few seconds later, I heard the front door being yanked open. And then... nothing.

I lay there, frozen in fear, unable to move, too terrified to open my eyes. I don’t even remember when I finally fell asleep.
The next morning, I woke up around 6 AM. The first thing I did was rush to the kitchen, expecting to see broken dishes or glass. But strangely, nothing was out of place. 

Everything was intact.

Except for one thing.

Our front door was wide open.
