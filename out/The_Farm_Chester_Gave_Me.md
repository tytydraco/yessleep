I don’t post often, but I need someone to tell me I’m not losing my mind.

I’m Gregory. 38. Divorced, broke, and exhausted. After my last job laid me off, I decided I needed out of the city before it swallowed me whole. I thought some quiet country air might reset me.

That’s when Chester came back into my life.

Chester was a family friend. Gruff old man, the kind who seemed born old. Suspenders over a faded gray shirt, pants that were always stained with some kind of slick black oil. It never came off. My mother never explained what he did for work, just said he “fixed things.”

I ran into him in a bar in Rochester. The kind of bar where your shoes stick just enough to the floor to remind you not to sit down too fast. He was drinking whiskey alone.

“You look like hell,” he said without even turning.

I told him I was out of work, maybe looking for something different. He grinned, showing teeth that looked too sharp for a man his age.

“There’s a farm upstate. Place needs tending. Belonged to a friend of mine. Land don’t like being empty too long. You take it on, you’ll be set.”

He slid a ring of heavy, iron keys across the table. I don’t remember agreeing. I just remember walking out with the keys in my pocket.

The farm was… wrong.

Miles of corn that shouldn’t have been that tall in spring. A house sagging in on itself but solid underfoot, like it wanted me inside. The air was thick with the smell of soil, copper, and something oily that clung to my skin.

The first week, I tried to treat it like a normal farm job. Cleaning the barn, checking the fields, fixing fences. But I noticed things. The barn doors never stayed shut. The animals in the fields weren’t animals—just shapes that melted back into the corn if I got close.

At night, I heard scratching under the floorboards. Sometimes whispers through the walls. I kept telling myself it was rats, the wind, my imagination.

Then one night, the corn called my name.

Not rustling. Not the wind. Dozens of voices, all saying “Gregory.”

I called Chester the next morning. He answered on the first ring.

“You’re settling in,” he said. Not a question.

“What the hell is going on here?” I asked.

“Place don’t grow food,” he said. “Grows other things. Always has. Needs someone to keep it fed. That’s you now.”

I tried to laugh, but he wasn’t joking.

Last night, I woke up to find footprints on the porch. Oily, too large for me. They led from the corn to my door.

When I checked the lock, the keyhole was slick with black residue. Like something had tried to come in.

I don’t know what Chester fed this place before. I don’t know why he gave it to me.

But I can hear the corn even now. Whispering. Waiting.

And the longer I stay, the louder it gets.
