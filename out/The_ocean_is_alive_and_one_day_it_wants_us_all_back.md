I'm writing this not as a last ditch attempt for advice or saving,no its too late for me anyways. This is more of a warning I suppose,a way to preserve this  story even after my impending doom.

  


Ok let me start from the beginning. I grew up in a small town, if you could even call it that. I'd say it's more of a tiny glorified island surrounded by nothing but sea,sea and more sea. The only way to leave would be by one measly old  boat that comes every 6 hours. 



Not that a lot of people want to leave. Most of us get so used to the tiny houses,friendly neighbors and simple lives that living in a big city seemed like terrible torture. In Metropolis you'd be stuck in a loud chaotic ant farm with people who couldn't give two shits about you,while in here you were a true community. 



The only person who I remembered moving away for more than a year was my big sister and she even calls to complain every day about how much she misses all of us and how terrible it is outside of our town. So yeah,beyond our little island the world seemed like an absolute hellhole,while here was nothing but blissful paradise. 



Then why do I hate it so much?



This all started with a seemingly normal day. 



I was visiting Aunt Maria, a rather lovely but very boring old lady who I'd known basically all my life. We were drinking her signature camille tea,while she was talking about which one of her 10 dead cats was her favourite(it changed depending on her mood). I honestly dissociated through the entire conversation not caring one bit why Pickles was in every way better than Mr. Snuggles,until she absentmindedly said “The sea is beautiful today,isn't it?”



I instantly perked up. Don't get me wrong the ocean was quite pretty,it was one of the major selling points of our town but why mention it now? “Uhh yeah” I answered,very confused trying to understand what was going on. “I think I'll go take sweetie on a walk” Aunt Lydia mumbled out,standing up and going back to her house. I was left alone bewildered,flustered and kind of freaked out.



This was nothing like the polite old woman I knew. Aunt Lydia is the type of person to turn a “hello” into a 2 hour long conversation about whatever topic is specifically important to her,Leaving just like that was nothing like she'd ever do. I debated to simply follow her and ask   but my to-do list was filled with more important things that weren't pestering a wrinkly grandma about why the ocean suddenly became so popular on her discussion agenda.Instead I left,hoping that this was just a one time thing. 

  


Missing.



 Aunt Lydia was missing. 



Don't get me wrong.sudden disappearances weren't that big of a deal. Most of the time it was said that they left for the big city by the one boat and everyone automatically decided that it was not worth making a fuss over. But Aunt Lydia was 68,with no grandkids or other family members to visit. Why would she suddenly leave? 



I knew something was wrong.



But I ignored it.



After all, everyone else seemed to brush it off,so I went with my usual routine ignoring how neglected Aunt Lydia's house has gotten by now. 



This should have been the end of it,this was supposed to be the end of it. Just an old dusty grandma weirdly going missing,who cares?



But the more I ignored it,the more other red flags started popping out. The way I'd feel watched wherever I would go. You know the feeling as if something is just waiting for you to make the wrong move? The way missing people posters were handed out like small colorful pieces of candy and no one would care.



“Maria has been gone for a week”



“She probably just went to the big city by the boat”

 

To think that just a week ago I was one of those people.Ignoring it all,treating it like it was a normal  everyday occurrence. How many people have disappeared already? 5? 10? 20? 50?



Why was everyone else so blind?

Why didn't anyone do anything?



The blissful paradise I lived in all my life fell right at the seams and whatever scraps were left truly collapsed on one fateful night,when me and Micheal were walking by the shore.



Micheal was my best friend. And I don't mean those token ones that you flaunt around just to shit talk later. He was my platonic soulmate,my everything. We'd spent days playing Super Mario Galaxy,while discussing if Rosalina was Peach's long lost twin sister. We'd talk about school,work,relationships and other mundane things that adults are expected to talk about. Or we'd just not say anything,just enjoy each other's company to its fullest. 



Like tonight.



The moon was out,its reflection being warped by the slow waves. Micheal was quietly smoking a cigarette looking at some invisible point in the sky. He'd always do if very deep in thought. I myself am no smoker,so I just let my mind drift along with him without a need for nicotine. 

For a second the rest of the world seemed far away. It was just me,Micheal,the grey smoke,the moon and-



“The ocean looks quite enchanting tonight,wouldn't you agree?” 



The words were enough to send a shiver down my spine. 



“Ehh..what made you say that?”



Micheal didn't bother responding. Instead he caressly dropped the cigarette to the ground,before calmly making their way to the sea without taking even a small look back. 



“WAIT DONT GO” I yelled out in pure horror. Is this what happens to the missing people? Will Micheal go missing too? Will I ever see him again?

  


Tears strimmed down my eyes as I ran into water,desperately trying to hold onto my friend. But no reaction came out of him,not even a tiny twitch. 



Micheal. The same Micheal who'd  easily outrun me in tag every round,the same Micheal who promised to leave our town and get famous in Hollywood,the same Micheal who softly comforted me when my sister moved away was now submitting to their fate. 



He wasn't hysterically crying like I was,he wasn't even shaking,he was just calmly walking as my slippery hands had no choice but to let go of his arm. 



“MICHEAL YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE DONT PLEASE”



I continued to desperately  yell as his form slowly disappeared in the mass of the salty water,consumed by its ice cold tides. 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  


We all started from the ocean. Our whole world was created from the dark depths of the sea. Maybe that's why we used to worship it. Maybe that's why one day it wants us back. 



You know at the beginning I said that this was a warning,well that's not quite true. A warning would mean there's a way to save yourself.



Which would be a lie. 



I just want you to know that one day you'll return into the water,it's inevitable. You can't hide from it under the bed,you can't whisper some quotes from the bible thinking it will disappear. 



All you can do is accept that this will be the end and hope you'll still have enough time to spend doing what you love. 



Micheal certainly didn't. 

I certainly don't either.



…



The ocean looks absolutely captivating today.
