 

The moon hung low over the sleepy town of RidgeWater Creek, its faint glow barely penetrating the dense forest on the outskirts.

As I stepped out of my car, my boots crunched against the gravel road, carrying me toward the cordoned-off crime scene.

The red and blue strobes of police lights painted chaotic flashes across the area, but my focus remained on the figure sprawled on the ground.

The first thing that struck me was the smell—a sickly mix of damp soil and something metallic, almost like rusted iron or old blood.

It was the kind of stench that clings to the back of your throat, refusing to let go. I adjusted my scarf as I ducked under the yellow tape fluttering in the wind.

The victim was a man in his late thirties—married, no kids—a local high school teacher named Gregory. He lay on his back, arms splayed wide as if he’d been clawing at the ground in desperation. But there were no wounds, no blood, no evidence of force or struggle. His body was completely intact.

Then my flashlight caught his face, and I felt my stomach drop.

His mouth hung unnaturally wide, stretched into a soundless scream frozen in time. His eyes bulged, staring at the void, but still radiated with raw unrelenting terror.

It was as if his last moments had been carved into his flesh—a permanent echo of whatever had seized him in those final horrifying seconds.

A shiver crawled up my spine as my thoughts immediately snapped back to two other murders, both eerily similar, and both occurring within the last two weeks.

I lowered my flashlight, sweeping it over the ground around the body. That’s when I noticed it: a crudely etched circle surrounding him, as though drawn during his final moments.

Near his feet, a string of letters was scrawled into the dirt—in a language I couldn’t recognize.

The arrangement felt disturbingly ritualistic, as if the victim had somehow been drawn into a sinister rite that eventually claimed his life.

What made the scene even more grotesque was that the two earlier victims had also been found dead under similar circumstances.

The next day back at my station, I immersed myself in the case files, leaning back in my chair as the details swirled through my mind.

**Victim One, Clara**: A store clerk was found dead in her living room, slumped in a corner. There was no sign of forced entry, but her face was frozen in paralyzing fear. Using her lipstick, she had drawn a circle around herself and left illegible scrawls near her feet. She had even quit her job a week earlier, citing stress, and was living alone at the time.

**Victim Two, Jack** :  A mechanic found dead in his garage, surrounded by scattered tools. Neighbors mentioned he’d been hearing strange noises outside his house for days. In the week leading up to his death, he barricaded himself in the garage and stopped visiting the local bar, where he was a regular after work.

**Victim Three, Gregory:** A high school teacher, beloved by his students, with no known enemies or debts. His wife observed that he had recently grown terrified of leaving the house after dark, often twitching and trembling at the slightest noise. Then, one night, without explanation, he left home and wandered into the woods a mile away, where he was found dead.

Three victims, three different lives, and no tangible connections between them—except for one chilling similarity: the circumstances of their deaths and the fear that was permanently etched across their faces.

There was also another detail I had to account for. In all three crime scenes, an object was found lying next to the corpse. With the first victim it was a small hand held mirror, with the mechanic it was a miniature toy bus and with the high school teacher, it was a fountain pen.

The really odd thing here though was that the objects looked like relics that belonged to another era, probably the late 70’s or the early 80’s, and it made me wonder if they had been left behind by the killer.

Sergeant Holbrook, however, had a different take. He didn’t mince words, calling it outright “the work of the devil.” A police veteran with decades of experience, Holbrook claimed to remember similar occurrences from his childhood. And each time we arrived at a new crime scene, I could see his face grow paler, as if the evidence before us confirmed his worst fears.

The people of the town had a similar opinion as well. Especially the elderly folks who remembered the killings more than 50 years ago. And when the photos of victims leaked and went viral, it was only a matter of time before the whole community got swept in on the frenzy.

As I took a sip of coffee, Sergeant Holbrook stepped into my cabin, holding a file from the coroner’s office. I opened it, already anticipating what I’d find.

Like the others, our latest victim showed no signs of trauma or struggle—no defensive wounds, no bruises, nothing.

All three had been in good health with no underlying medical conditions. The coroner’s report mentioned cardiac arrest brought on by extreme stress,  but the words rang hollow. It felt more like a convenient excuse than any real explanation.

“Officer Harper…” Holbrook’s voice suddenly cut through my thoughts, his tone measured, almost hesitant. “The Mayor wants to meet you at the town hall.”

A knot tightened in my stomach. Town hall meetings were rarely good news.

With three unexplained deaths in less than 2 weeks, the townsfolk of Ridgewater Creek—a tight-knit community of just 1,000 people—were bound to have questions, and not the easy kind. News here moved faster than the wind, and the pressure to provide answers was mounting.

Being the new cop in town— a city officer who had moved here just six months ago to take charge—had already made me a topic of gossip. Now, with these cases piling up, it felt like the tide of suspicion was beginning to shift toward me.

Holbrook and I climbed into the cruiser, and as we drove through the quiet streets, I stared out the window, running through what I’d say in my head.

When we arrived, the town hall was already packed with people. Parents clutched their children protectively, teenagers huddled together in nervous whispers, and the elderly exchanged worried glances. The weight of their fear hung heavy in the air, pressing against me like a storm cloud as I walked nervously through the room, their silent stares following my every step.

The mayor opened the meeting with strained reassurances before gesturing for me to step forward.

"Good morning," I started, scanning the sea of tense, worried faces. "I'm Officer Evelyn Harper. I want to reassure you that we are doing everything within our power to solve these tragic cases. While we don't have all the answers yet, we are committed to uncovering the truth. But we need your cooperation. For the next 10 days, please, stay indoors after dark, and if you notice anything unusual, report it to us immediately."

As I continued speaking and patiently answered their questions, my eyes continuously swept over the crowd.

One woman in the second row particularly stood out. Her silver hair gleamed under the harsh lights, and her hands rested neatly on her lap. While the rest wore their fear openly, her expression was serene—calm to the point of detachment.

When the meeting ended an hour later, I swiftly moved toward her. "Excuse me, ma’am," I said as the crowd began to thin.

She turned to me, her blue eyes sharp and clear. “Hello Officer. I am Ruth. Nice to finally meet you,” she said with a faint smile.

“Ruth,” I said, stepping closer, “would you like a ride home?”

Her smile deepened just slightly. “That’s very kind of you, Officer Harper. Yes. I’d appreciate that.”

Holbrook gave me a questioning glance, but I waved him off, while Ruth and I walked toward the cruiser.

As we drove to her residence, Ruth began to share snippets from her life. She was in her early seventies, born and raised in Ridgewater Creek. She’d never married, had no children, and retired only recently from her position as the local school librarian.

When we arrived at her place, she invited me inside. Her home was warm and inviting, carrying the comforting scent of old wood and lavender.

But what struck me most however was the massive bookshelf dominating her living room, stretching floor to ceiling and packed with books—some weathered, others pristine, all meticulously arranged.

“You have quite the collection,” I remarked, my eyes scanning the rows of books.

“Books are windows to understanding, Officer Harper,” she said with a wistful smile. “But they can also be windows to something darker… something forgotten.”

 “You seemed unusually calm today at the town hall,” I said carefully as I took a seat across from her.

“Fear clouds judgment, my dear,” she replied softly. “I’ve lived long enough to know that panic only leads to mistakes. The key is to look closely, think clearly, and see what others might overlook.”

Her words lingered, and I leaned forward. “So what are your thoughts on these deaths? What do you think is really going on here?”

Ruth stood without replying, crossing to her bookshelf. Her fingers brushed over the spines before settling on a weathered, leather-bound volume. She opened it with care, flipping through the pages until she stopped at an illustration.

The image was jarring: a figure lay on the ground, encircled by a crudely drawn ring, with an undecipherable text scrawled near its feet. It was eerily similar to the crime scenes. My heart suddenly skipped a beat.

“This… this looks just like the crime scenes,” I whispered.

I leaned closer, studying the page. “What does the scrawl mean?”

Her gaze met mine, calm yet piercing. “It says ‘Jurupari,’” she replied, her voice steady. “It means ‘Voice of Fear.’ According to an ancient Amazonian legend, it's an entity that devours the soul of its victim after overwhelming them with fear.”

A cold knot tightened in my stomach as I stared at the illustration, unsure of what to say.

Ruth then turned back a page, pointing to a dark, distorted figure cloaked in shadow. “This is what the legend speaks of,” she explained. “An entity feared for centuries, known for consuming the souls of its victims. It thrives on fear—smelling it, tasting it and even savoring it. Its origins are unknown, but it has appeared across the country in several places over the years. Fifty years ago, it came to Ridgewater Creek.”

I listened, both horrified and captivated, as her words sank in.

“In the seventies,” she continued, “this town was plagued by a series of unexplained deaths. No signs of struggle, no obvious causes—people were just dropping dead, and no one could figure out why. It went on for months, freezing the town in fear. The police were desperate for answers, but they found nothing.”

She paused, her face darkening with the weight of the memory. “That’s when I found this book. As a librarian, I often sourced rare volumes, and when I saw this one, I had a feeling it might hold the answers we needed. I took it to the police chief, but he dismissed it immediately—called it nonsense.”

Her expression softened, and a faint smile tugged at her lips. “But there was one person who listened—a young sergeant named Henry Cross. He quietly observed while I tried to explain to the Chief. He was the tenacious type I must say, the kind of man who couldn’t let something go until he understood it. He even came to my home, sat right where you’re sitting now, and let me explain I knew. A few days later, he came back and said he’d found a promising lead. He was going somewhere to investigate.”

 “And then?” I asked eager to get to the bottom of it.

She sighed deeply. “I never saw him again. He vanished without a trace. The murders stopped soon after, and the town returned to normal. But Henry… he was never seen or heard from again.”

“What do you think happened?” I asked intrigued.

Her expression grew inscrutable as she hesitated. “That, Officer Harper, is a question I’ve pondered for decades. Maybe you can connect the dots, and let me know how this story ends.”

“Do you know where he went?” I pressed.

She nodded. “He said he was going to the sawmill.”

Just then, my phone buzzed in my pocket. I quickly answered, Holbrook’s voice sharp with urgency.

“Chief,” he said, his tone grim, “we’ve got another one.”

“Where?” I asked, my grip tightening on the phone.

“The old sawmill,” he replied.

I quickly thanked Ruth and headed for the mill, long abandoned and feared by the local townsfolk. Perched on the edge of town, it had stood vacant for decades, its history making it a place that people usually believe to be haunted.  

As I stepped out of my cruiser, the thick, suffocating scent of rusted iron and decay hit me as if it had settled into the very air.

Before me loomed the mill, a Second World War era relic continuing to wither away under years of neglect. The roof had caved in at several points, and vines snaked through the broken windows, claiming the crumbling interior. The structure still somehow seemed almost alive, yet entirely forgotten.

To my right, a jeep had crashed into the side of the building, its front half crushed against the brickwork. Paramedics were extracting the driver’s lifeless body, twisted and mangled beyond recognition. The passenger door hung open, offering a clear view inside the mill where another young man lay sprawled across the dusty floor.

Unlike his friend this one was alive. As I approached, I noticed one of the medics kneeling beside him, injecting something into his bloodstream to stabilize him.

Moments later, the man startled awake, his body jerking as his eyes flew open, wide with terror. He scanned the scene wildly, his breath ragged and shallow, until his gaze fixed on the wrecked jeep outside. Recognition dawned, and his chest heaved as he tried to speak.

“It’s my friend,” he gasped, his voice breaking. “He just... he just lost it. We were headed to the city—everything was fine. Then, out of nowhere, he panicked. Started screaming like a madman—like he had seen something. He suddenly swerved off the road and drove straight into the building. I... I barely managed to jump out just before we hit the building.”

The medics eventually helped him to his feet and escorted him to the waiting ambulance.

Meanwhile, I turned my attention to the mill’s interior. My eyes were drawn instantly to a large, sealed fireplace at one end of the room. The mortar appeared weathered, but the bricks had been meticulously arranged, completely blocking the hearth.

I stepped outside again, unable to shake the peculiar sight that kept nagging at me. From the outside, I could see that the jeep had rammed directly into the building's fireplace. I called for Sergeant Holbrooke, and together, we had the vehicle reversed. As the jeep was pulled back, the bricks began to crumble, revealing something hidden within.

Behind the wall of debris was a skeletal figure, awkwardly slumped in the confines of the fireplace. Its bony hands tightly clutched a weathered brown book, its leather cover stained with a large patch of blood on the back, yet otherwise its overall condition remarkably intact.

The tattered remnants of fabric clinging to the skeletal remains made the uniform hard to identify, but the government-issued firearm lying beside him left no doubt in my mind: I was looking at the mortal remains of Sergeant Cross.

We spent the rest of the day combing through the mill, collecting the necessary samples for forensic testing, and then interrogating the survivor back at the hospital to get his full account of the events.

By the time I was finished, it was already half past eleven. As I was heading out for home, I noticed the sergeant's journal lying in the evidence tray, tagged and ready for testing. Without thinking, I grabbed it and made my way home, planning to take a long bath before finally getting some rest.

Entering the bathroom, I prepared the tub, quickly undressed, and waded into the warm water. As I leaned back, I picked up the sergeant’s journal and began reading.

 

 

 ***Investigative Journal of H. Cross***

*People like to think the badge is about "serve and protect." But for me, it’s always been about Ricky and what he stood for. He’s the reason I’m here, walking the beat, keeping an eye out for the bully lurking in the shadows.*

*Growing up in foster care, I didn’t have much more than the shirt on my back and a hundred reasons to keep my head down. The other kids were bigger, meaner, and twice as cruel. Every day felt like a battle, and every night I prayed I wouldn’t wake up with a black eye—or worse.*

*Then came Ricky.*

*He wasn’t some guardian angel swooping in to save me. Nah, he was just another kid dumped into the system, rough around the edges like the rest of us. But Ricky didn’t believe in running or hiding.*

*“Punch first and think later,” he always used to say, and he lived by it.*

*He taught me how to stand tall, to fight back—not just with fists, but with grit, persistence, and anything else that gave us an edge.*

*A poke in the eye, a kick in the nuts, smashing a bottle over someone’s head while they were busy eating—it didn’t matter. The rules were simple: keep going, again and again, until they start to feel it in their bones.*

*I’ll never forget the one time we fought back. Three bigger kids had us cornered behind the school yard. They were huge, grinning like wolves, and ready to pounce.*

*Ricky didn’t hesitate. He threw the first punch, and I followed right behind him. We didn’t win—not even close. By the end of it, we were in the hospital with more broken bones than I could count. My ribs ached for weeks, and every breath felt like fire.*

*But what I remember most isn’t the pain—it’s lying there in that hospital bed, tears streaming down my face, feeling something I’d never felt before: a sense of victory. We may not have won the fight, but we held our heads high. And when we got finally back, we tormented them for weeks until we made damn sure they never picked on us again.*

*Ricky was the only real friend I ever had—the only one that mattered, at least. So when I found him dead at a crime scene, his soul ripped from him, leaving only fear etched on his face, it felt like something inside me had been ripped away too. This wasn’t just murder—it was personal.*

*I knew then and there I’d stop at nothing to find the bastard who did this. I owed Ricky that much. This journal is my attempt to piece it all together—my thoughts, my rage, my resolve.*

*It’s time to bully the bully.*

 

 

***Day 1***

*I hadn’t set foot in the sawmill since my teens, back when a group of us dared each other to explore its eerie halls. No one knows exactly why the place was deemed cursed, but the story goes that workers arrived one morning to a grisly sight: the owner’s lower half lying severed by the saw table, while his upper half roasted in the fireplace.*

*The mill never reopened, and its sinister reputation only deepened with time. Whispers of ghost sightings and unexplained phenomena grew so pervasive that authorities eventually sealed the fireplace to deter thrill-seekers and other oddballs from exploiting the site.*

*Now, here I was again, on a stakeout, sitting in my car hidden among a row of trees with the decaying structure looming in the distance.*

*My mind immediately wandered to the events of the past couple of months. Ridgewater Creek had seen more than 25 deaths, including that of my friend, and we were no closer to solving the case.*

*The air in town was thick with fear—people were irritable, on edge, constantly glancing over their shoulders. Chaos was unravelling right before my eyes, and the community was fraying at the seams.*

*The Chief was unwavering in his belief that a serial killer was behind it all. At first, I agreed—especially with the peculiar items left at each crime scene: an ashtray, a felt hat, a tennis racket, a wristwatch, a cassette tape, a torch etc. They seemed deliberate, almost like a calling card. But the more I examined them, the more they felt... disconnected. There was no clear pattern, no logic linking the objects to each other or the victims.*

*As the body count climbed, so did my doubts. Something about it didn’t sit right.*

*The breakthrough came unexpectedly when a young woman walked into the station, clutching a theory about a supernatural entity tied to an old legend she’d uncovered in a dusty book. The Chief dismissed her as a crank, but desperation has a way of shifting priorities.*

*I couldn’t afford to ignore any lead—no matter how improbable. That evening, I met her at her home. As she laid out her theory, a strange sense of clarity took hold. And it got me thinking.*

*If the entity she called Jurupari was real, it would need a place to hide—somewhere near town but remote enough to remain undisturbed.  The place had to be abandoned, forgotten by time, where no one would think to look.*

*And only one such place came to mind.*

*So when I returned to the sawmill after all these years, I found it in even worse shape than I’d imagined—its wooden frame sagging, the air thick with the stench of rot and mildew.*

*I scoured every corner, but there was nothing unusual. No signs of anything lurking, no evidence to support Ruth’s theory. I was even ready to write it off as a dead end and leave when something caught my eye.*

*In a dim corner of the mill half-buried in debris, lay a curious cluster of items: an American flag keychain, a leather wallet, a razor and a bottle opener. At first glance, they seemed like random junk, discarded and forgotten.*

*But on closer inspection, I noticed they weren’t old or tattered. These items looked reasonably new, and oddly out of place—as if someone had deliberately gathered them, seeing still some value in them where others saw trash. It hit me then: someone, or something, was holding out here. I decided to continue my surveillance for a few more days.*

 

***Day 2***  
*I arrived at the mill as soon as I finished my shift at the station. I spent the entire night keeping watch, fighting off fatigue until sleep finally overtook me in the wee hours of the morning. I jolted awake suddenly, certain I’d seen a sudden flash of light. Heart pounding, I leapt out of the vehicle and rushed to the mill. But when I got there, everything was just as I’d seen it the night before—empty and undisturbed.*

 

***Day 3***  
*When I returned to work in the morning, I heard news of another body.*

*This time, it was an old man who was found dead in his garden, his eyes and mouth locked in an expression of pure terror. But what truly sent a chill down my spine was the leather wallet lying next to him—it was the same one I had seen earlier at the mill.*

*When I rushed back to the mill, I found the wallet and keychain missing while the razor, and bottle opener still remained by the side.*

*An uneasy sensation coursed through my veins as I stared at the objects scattered on the floor.*

*Gripping a stick, I cautiously nudged them apart before hesitantly hovering my little finger over the razor. Taking a deep breath, I let the tip of my little finger make contact.*

*A warm, fuzzy sensation enveloped me, and in an instant, I was transported to a memory from my childhood—my mom tossing me into the air, her laughter ringing out as she caught me mid-flight, then planting a kiss on my cheek.*

*Without thinking, I next placed my ring finger on the razor, and the feeling intensified. This time, I was surrounded by both my parents, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of birthday candles as I leaned in to blow them out.*

*Sweat trickled down my chin as I began lifting my fingers one by one, preparing to grasp the razor fully.*

*But the moment my hand closed around it, a long-buried memory surged to the surface—a fateful night I had forced into the deepest recesses of my mind, one that irrevocably and painfully altered the course of my life.*

*Gasping, I tore my hand away just in time, the force of the memory knocking me backward. My chest tightened as I lay sprawled on the floor, staring at the razor, now innocuously lying among the debris.*

*Then it hit me—a thick, metallic tang in the air, sharp and unmistakable, like rusted iron. The atmosphere in the mill shifted entirely, growing heavier and oppressive.*

*Then, from the direction of the sealed fireplace, a low rumble echoed.*

*I crept closer, my movements slow and deliberate, as I leaned against the cold concrete straining to listen. And the hair on the back of my neck stood on end when I heard it—something faint but unmistakable.*

 *It was cackling, low and stifled, as though someone or something was struggling to suppress its glee.*
