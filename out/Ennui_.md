Being buried alive is a pretty common theme in a lot of horror stories. I never thought too hard about the specifics, the notion seemed terrible enough without the need for any deeper consideration. Why waste time thinking about it? But all I have is time now. Limited time, but there's nothing I can do but think... And type. She left me my phone at least. Actually no, not at least. That was shitty of her, she's taunting me. Obviously I have no signal underground, all I can do is hope this makes it online eventually and play candy crush until the oxygen runs out.

Anyways, like I said. All I have is time, around 30 hours to be exact. The average person uses about 23 liters of air per hour, and the average coffin holds 886 liters. So yeah, you have about 30 hours to escape. However, if you panic and start hyperventilating, the oxygen will run out sooner. If you're struggling to get out, oxygen levels can drop by about half a percent per minute. Which is why I'm just thinking right now... And playing candy crush. I figure I might as well relax and think; hope that an escape plan comes naturally without freaking out and losing precious air.

Think Moony think. How did you get here? Gagged and blind folded in the back of her truck in the immediate sense obviously, but big picture wise, I think I might have been slowly getting buried alive for the past —

2023

Weariness. Dissatisfaction. Ennui. It eats me from the inside out. I check the time, not even noon yet. My eyes flicker down to the file in front of me. She's somewhere in Beijing, she works at Samsung. It's not enough, I need her legal name. At least I have a goal, I guess. But what happens after? What do I say when I find her? It's over? But is it? My father is dead, but the church is still standing. He killed himself, but he shot your mom first. Three times. Chest. Shoulder. Right arm. Missed all vital points but she can't write anymore. Do with this information what you will, it's none of my business. I'm just a messenger.

I exhale and slam the files back down. Why am I doing this? To help my stepmom? To protect my sister? To atone for my father's misdeeds? I touch my bruised cheek, haven't I done enough? I'm paying his debts, I'm cleaning up the mess he left behind. So why? 

"You know why." I hear the familiar low voice rumble in the back of my head.

Shut up.

Present time.

My thoughts are getting jumbled. I thought the worst part would be the first bucket of soil. It was a shock, just that little bit and I could feel crushing weight from all sides of the wooden box.  The next few buckets were less scary, but now when I press my hands against the lid there's no give. 27 more hours to think. I hope Winston is still alive. I miss Avery, but it's better if she moves on. I hope Sunny is in bed, she needs her sleep.

I resist the urge to scream. I can't waste the oxygen.

2021

I hold my sister's hand tightly. Sunny was always fragile. Quick to anger. Quick to tears. I feel her fingers interlaced through mine, trembling.

"She must have done something to him." She mumbles to me.

"I don't think so." I reply, my eyes scanning the chapel. The air is stale and muted. The pews creak in protest as if softly echoing past gatherings. Reminding us that he was here. 

He was the heart of the church and all his followers were the thick streams of blood that fed into his madness. The pastor enters with an impassive expression. He stands at the altar. Our eyes meet. I bite down the bile. He's an ally for now, only because he saw through my father's illusion. But they're of the same breed. Pastor Jun wanted what my father had, but wasn't capable enough to follow through. 

My stepmother quietly trails in. Mary. Sweet, simple, stinking rich Mary. Her eyes are downcast, her arm is in a cast, she's rail thin. Her chin length hair frames her delicate face. She glances towards Sunny and me, and offers us a gentle smile. I nod towards her. Sunny's hand clutches mine tighter.

"What the fuck?" Sunny whispers in a strained voice, "She... She looks like—"

"I know." I know. I know. I know.

"Moony... She—" Sunny's lips press into a tight line and she shuts her eyes. She doesn't want to look anymore.

"She looks like mom." I say it so Sunny doesn't have to.

Present time.

I'm still off the mark. I haven't gone far back enough. This shit is hard. I can barely stand talking to my therapist about what I had for breakfast, much less break down the years leading up to my present inevitable demise.

"FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK YOU! LET ME OUT! YOU PYSCHO BITCH! LET ME OUT!"

I scream and thrash and punch the lid. My knuckles crack and bleed, my breath comes in short gasps. I can feel my tears carving wet lines down my dirt soaked face. Shit, I wonder how many hours of my oxygen I just killed. Screaming feels good though.

2008

The sign reads, The School of Solace. The lettering is in bright red, freshly painted, in contrast to the gray debilitated building that stands behind it. 

"Looked better in the pictures." Mom mutters. I clutch her skirt nervously as we approach the steps. Three young women wave us in, they look welcoming, happy, blissful even. Their expressions are exactly identical. It sends chills up my spine.

We cross the threshold, the floorboards creak softly beneath our feet. I take a glance at the women escorting us. They're all dressed in gray scrubs, hair tied back, smiles bright, but vacant. Three different people, but somehow their eerie smiles and soft voices seem to stretch from one person to the next, like a low drone of something innumerable. Like white static.

We stop in front of a hallway with several doors. One door is ajar, I can hear the low rumble of my father's voice emit from the crack in the entryway.

"I'm Rachel," The woman nearest to my mother chirps brightly, "This is Rebecca and Mary." 

The two other women nod their heads in acknowledgement.

"I'll be escorting you during your visit, Ms. Liu." Rachel continues. Mom shakes her head and cuts her off.

"No need to be so formal. You can call me Holly." Mom says flatly.

"Holly then. Right this way." Rachel obliges, gesturing to the open door, "Rebecca and Mary will take Moony to the playroom."

My eyes widen and I clutch harder to my mother.

"Mom, I don't want to. Their faces scare me." I blurt out, "I want to stay with you. I want to see Dad too."

"Don't be rude, Moony." My mom replies sharply, "Go."

I bite my lip and let go of her skirt. I'm unsettled looking at the faces of the women, so I stare at their feet instead as they walk me down to the end of the hallway. We enter a room awash with nauseating fluorescent light. A sad decrepit stack of faded alphabet blocks litters the floor. Abacus-like toy mazes sit on a square plastic table in the middle of the room. There's a deep brown stain in the beige carpet under the table. Another girl is in the room already. She sits on the floor, wearing a gray school uniform, the skirt pools around her small frame on the ground. She looks a few years younger than me. I take a seat near her next to the toy table. She scowls at me. Mary approaches her and pats her head absentmindedly.

"My daughter, Eve." Mary says with that same vacant smile on her face, "Be nice to our guest. She's the child of Solace."

Interesting. She refers to my dad by his pen name on his publications. His given name is Weijien. It translates to solace in English. The girl flinches at her mother's touch and pulls her knees to her chin.

"Okay." She mumbles, looking at me with wary eyes.

Mary nods to Rebecca and the two women leave the room. I hear the click of the door locking behind them.

"Eve? I'm Moony." I say, turning to the frowning girl.

"I don't care." She replies, swiveling to face away from me, "And my name isn't Eve."

"Oh... What's your name?" I ask, not really interested, but I should be friendly at least.

"Not telling." She plops her face into her knees, her long black braids dangling around her folded arms.

What a brat.

"Okay." I shrug and idly touch the colorful wooden beads on the table. Silence permeates the room. I lay down on the worn carpet and stare at the brown stain under the table.

"Ugh..." My eyes snap open, I must have dozed off. Eve stands over me with a hateful look on her face. What is this girl's problem? I don't even know her.

"It's supper time." She says curtly, "The bell just rang."

As if on cue, I hear the door unlock and Mary enters. 

"Hello girls. Did we get along?" She asks.

Eve and I exchange a look and we both nod stiffly. Mary's unsettling smile widens and she gestures for us to follow. We navigate the winding hallways, passing a few open doors. I catch sight of a small windowless room with 8 bunk beds crammed inside, blankets and pillows folded neatly. Every bed has a book resting on it. I recognize it as Dad's best seller, "Ennui". We continue walking until we enter a massive dining hall. One long table stretches from one end of the room to the other. Each seat is occupied by a staff member. They all wear gray scrubs and identical smiles. More white static.

My father and mother enter, taking a seat at the head of the table. Eve and I are ushered to a smaller table in the corner with a handful of other children.

"I'm honored today to look upon my beautiful family. My lovely wife, my daughter, and all of you who support and uplift our mission everyday." Dad's voice carries across the room.

"Education is a privilege. " He continues, "One that very little are afforded. As humans we are all connected by the presence of God. We are all made in his image. As such those of us who have the wherewithal must offer grace to the less fortunate. The School of Solace is nothing without all of you sitting in this room, giving your all to provide for those in need of education. To be able to communicate is to exist."

Everyone in the room besides my mother and the children put their hands together as if in prayer. Their voices fill the room.

"To be able to communicate is to exist. Thank you, Solace."

My stomach churns. What is this? I thought my dad opened a private school in Beijing focusing on language and literacy. He's not even religious. Or I don't think he is. Then again, I don't know that much about him. I only see him a few months out of the year and he usually drops me off with his publisher's family during the day and picks me up to go back to his apartment to sleep. Then rinse and repeat. My mother sits next to him. Her expression is cold and unreadable. His eyes flicker to her, as if searching her face for something.

The next day my parents send me to Sheng Yang to stay with my aunt's family. On the car ride there, I finally have a chance to tell my dad that I'd won a short story competition at school. I was so excited, I dream of being a best seller just like him, to one day write something meaningful and important too. His eyes stay on the road as he drives and he says nothing. He doesn't even acknowledge my presence in the backseat. I wonder for a moment if I had spoken at all.

---------------------------
Present time.
---------------------------

The wound on the side of my head throbs. I don't even have space in the coffin to reach up and hold my blood caked temple. The fucking snake caught me with my back turned. Something is clicking in my brain, I think I'm getting closer to the roots, to where this all began. But I'm so sleepy. Maybe if I set an alarm on my phone, I can catch a nap and wake up with a clearer mind. Can't be a worse idea than screaming was.

23 hours left. Just need... a quick... rest.
