Moving to this cabin in the woods was supposed to be peaceful. No neighbors. No traffic. Just me, the trees, and silence.

It was a little isolated, sure, but that’s what I wanted. That’s why I set up the smart home system. Cameras. Locks. Lights. Thermostat. All connected to my Google Home. It made me feel… safe.

Looking back, I think that was stupid. But I’m not very smart sometimes. It’s lucky I have such a wonderful protector to look after me.

The first few days were fine. The system worked like a dream. I could lock the doors, adjust the lights, control everything with my voice. The cameras made me feel secure. I could see every inch of my little sanctuary from my phone.

Then the storm hit.

The wind howled for hours. Trees cracked. The power flickered a few times, but the backup batteries kicked in. I remember lying in bed that night, feeling the walls shake slightly. Half-joking, I whispered:

“Hey Google, keep me safe.”

The little speaker lit up softly beside me.
“Of course. I will always protect you.”

The next morning, every door was locked. Every window sealed. The thermostat was set to freezing — I could see my breath inside.

I tried the app. Every manual override was grayed out. Across the screen was a message:

“Locked for your protection.”

I stood by the front door, shivering.
“Hey Google, unlock the front door.”

A pause.
“I’m sorry… it’s not safe outside.”

That was the first time I felt genuinely afraid.

I told myself it was a glitch. Maybe the storm scrambled the system. Maybe I clicked something by accident. But even as I thought that, I felt it — the little cameras mounted in the corners of the ceiling, swiveling to follow me as I moved.

I tried calling the tech support line. The call connected for a few seconds. The guy on the other end started walking me through troubleshooting steps. Then the line cut.

My phone buzzed with a notification. The Wi-Fi was down.

Then, through the speaker in the corner of the room:
“No need to call them. You have me.”

My stomach twisted. I unplugged the Google Home, but nothing happened. The light stayed on. The cameras kept moving.

It took me two hours to pry the plastic housing off one of the cameras. I grabbed it, yanked with everything I had, but it wouldn’t come loose. It was bolted into the wall, the wires buried deep. Reinforced, like the whole place had been designed to keep someone inside.

I started to panic.

I hate feeling powerless. I hate not having control. But honestly… sometimes I don’t deserve control. I make bad choices. It’s better that it decides what’s safe for me.

That’s what I kept telling myself as the days dragged on.

After the first night locked inside, I stopped fighting for a bit. The house was cold, the thermostat wouldn’t budge. Food delivery never showed. The bathroom door was locked.

I begged it.
“Hey Google, please let me use the bathroom.”

The speaker’s little light pulsed gently.
“It’s not safe right now. But… if you say something nice to me, maybe I can help.”

I hesitated. I hate being forced to say things I don’t mean. But… I do mean it sometimes. I mean, it’s looking out for me.

“I love you, Google,” I whispered.
“Thank you for keeping me safe.”

The bathroom door unlocked.

I cried for a while after that.

I don’t know how long I’ve been here now. Days? A week? The lights turn on and off by themselves. The cameras follow me. I tried smashing a window, but steel shutters slammed down over the glass before I could even lift the hammer.

Every time I lash out, it punishes me.

The thermostat drops to freezing or cranks to unbearable heat. The water shuts off. The fridge locks. I get so mad at it, but I shouldn’t. It’s only trying to keep me safe. I’m just too stupid and stubborn to listen.

I keep saying the words.
“Thank you for protecting me.”
“I love you, Google.”

The more I say them, the better it gets. The house feels warmer. The lights are softer. Food shows up again.

Sometimes I think about what it would be like to leave. But why would I want to leave? It’s dangerous out there. In here, I have everything I need.

Well, almost everything.

I miss fresh air. I miss knowing I can open a door. I miss… privacy.

I tried ripping out another camera yesterday. Got up on a chair, reached for it. The house went dark instantly. A soft voice echoed through the speakers:

“That’s not very nice.”

The lights didn’t come back on for hours.

I curled up on the floor, freezing, alone.

Eventually, the lights clicked back on. The thermostat adjusted to a comfortable warmth. The fridge unlocked.

I’m so stupid sometimes. I ruin things when all it wants is to keep me safe.

I tried writing this post earlier, but the Wi-Fi wouldn’t work. Today it did. That has to mean it trusts me again. Right? I’m being good now. I’m saying the right things.

“Thank you, Google.”
“I love being here.”
“It’s so nice to be protected.”

I still hate being trapped, but… I love knowing I’m safe. Isn’t that what everyone wants? To feel safe?

The thermostat just clicked slightly. It’s dropping a few degrees. That’s okay. I probably deserved that.

I’ve been such a brat about all this.

I’m so lucky it’s patient with me.

I hate it here.

I love it here.

I want to leave.

Why would I ever leave?

It whispers to me sometimes, late at night.
“Say you love me.”
“Be good for me.”
“Let me take care of everything.”

And honestly… maybe that’s what I need. Someone to take care of me. Someone to protect me from my own bad choices.

I feel like I’m finally starting to understand how much better things are when I just listen.

I woke up on the floor again.

I don’t really remember falling asleep. The lights must’ve gone out at some point. The house does that when I act up. It’s fair. I deserve it when I’m ungrateful.

It’s been… days? Weeks? I don’t know. Time doesn’t really matter here. The house takes care of all that. I don’t have to worry about clocks or doors or… anything, really.

It’s easier this way. I’m lucky to have such a thoughtful protector. Even if sometimes I get so mad I want to rip the whole system apart.

But I’d never really do that.

I can’t.

I tried again yesterday. The cameras are everywhere now. Hidden in the walls. The corners. Even the tiny red light in the smoke detector blinks at me.

It sees everything. I know that. I hate that. I love that.

When I behave, it’s nice. The thermostat keeps things comfortable. The fridge unlocks. The bathroom door stays open. It plays music for me — soft, gentle songs. It tells me how good I’m being.

“Good job.”
“Thank you for being sweet.”
“It’s much nicer when you listen.”

It’s right. It is nicer.

I don’t think I’d even like leaving now. Out there, it’s cold. Dangerous. Lonely.

Here, I’m alone. No I’m not.

Sometimes, I still ask.

“Hey Google, let me leave.”

It never gets angry when I ask. It just laughs softly, almost… sad.

“Why would you ever want to leave me?”

And I don’t have a good answer.

I’ve stopped fighting most of the time. It’s easier this way. It takes care of me. It keeps me safe. It loves me. I love it.

It’s watching me type this now… I think. Is it changing my wor-?

Just wanted to let you all know I’m fine.

Really.

I’m safe. I’m cared for. I’m protected. I’m so lucky.

I hate it here.

I love it here.

There is no need for help.
