Sorry for the long post but it’s worth it. Okay so first off I have bipolar, not sure which one but my doctor said it’s the less “extreme” type. Anyway after a pretty regular day of coloring and groups something very strange happened to me, not sure about all of the details but there was a new guy that came in and said something along the lines of “if anybody here wants anything just come ask me” and was met with a bunch of weird looks. Later that day in group he would say and do stuff that was very flirtatious and sexual towards me. I didn’t reciprocate at all so it’s not like I was leading him on or playing into it. Kept talking out of turn during group and especially making comments about or towards me when I would say stuff. 


I just took it as a compliment but I didn’t want to even speak to the person because I had trouble with a similar situation on another ward (someone following me and taking my personal things if I left the room.) very sweet person though. Either way I immediately said something to the staff because of that and they were super helpful and understanding. They separated us and the day went as normal.


After taking meds and getting ready to chill out, I went to talk with the guys I was making friends with for the time being and I noticed that the person mentioned before was actually not in the common room which made me feel kind of bad. I didn’t want them to be stuck in their room just because of me but I decided to be selfish :/ either way we all headed off to our rooms which we shared with another person, most places are like that I assume just for convenience. Luckily I had a cool roommate so it was easy to fall asleep. They also gave us earplugs to help if your roommate snores which I had usually worn because many roommate that just left did snore, the new one doesn’t.


 I decided not to use them this night which actually came to benefit me in a way. As I started to get more comfortable and just thinking to myself about the comic book I was reading earlier when I started to notice a really weird sort of shifting of weight underneath me. Which usually you wouldn’t notice because you’re sleeping on a mattress. The thing about that is I’m a weird bird and I sometimes sleep on the wood frame of the bed or on the floor with blankets under me. I thought it was just me shifting my weight so I just ignored it and tried to get some sleep, but it kept going after I stopped moving. I know how crazy this sounds trust me lol.


 I tested this numerous times and every time it seemed to respond to my weight in a way. Not only did I hear it but could see and feel the pressure of something pushing on the board. I layed on my back, my front, my sides. It was without a doubt moving. Never hallucinated in my life before or since. It wasn’t loud or hard but it was noticeable in such a quiet environment. This is going to sound even more insane which I know you couldn’t imagine but whoever the fuck was under there started whispering to me about how they have a fucking sex club/sex room or some weird shit where people fuck and do all types of devious stuff and that I can go if I want to. Is immediately shot up out of bed like a fire was under my butt and ran screaming out of the room which really didn’t help my case. I ran to the nurses station and told them I swear to god there is someone under my bed please check if that is even physically possible because there is a room right next to ours that isn’t used as a patients room. They gave me no closure whatsoever, told me to calm down and gave me super heavy meds to make me relax. 

I’ve literally never had an experience like this in my life, never hallucinated, seen or heard things that weren’t there before or since this. This was also at a pretty famously bad hospital in my area. Multiple therapists and doctors of mine knew exactly what I meant when I said “yeah I didn’t have too good of an experience there”. I know this topic isn’t really helpful it’s just something I’ll never forget, call it what you will but I figured I’d share it here.
