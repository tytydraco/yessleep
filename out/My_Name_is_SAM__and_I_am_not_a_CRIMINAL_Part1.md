**My name is Samarthya and you can call me Sam.People around me think that I am not mentally stable and I have a police case on me for murdering 11 people. Fun part , those 11 people were my family members.** 

This is my story and to understand it , I want you to imagine yourself as me.

So Imagine

You find yourself standing before the rusty iron gates of the Whispering Willows Asylum, a gloomy building that seems to have more stories than the books that line its long-abandoned library. The chilly wind whispers secrets through the overgrown ivy, hinting at the dark past that has earned it the ominous reputation it holds in the small town of Rivenwood. The guard at the entrance, a burly man with a name tag that reads "Officer Jenkins," eyes you skeptically.

"You're that new patient, Samarthya, aren't ya?" he gruffly inquires. You nod, feeling the weight of the world - or perhaps the accusations - pressing down on your shoulders. He sighs heavily and pulls out a set of keys, jingling them as he unlocks the gate. "Welcome to your new home, Sam. Just remember, everyone here's got their own tale, and it's best to keep your ears open but your mouth shut."

As the gates creak open, revealing the desolate path leading to the asylum's entrance, you can't help but wonder what twisted fate has brought you to this place, where whispers of insanity and murder cling to every shadow.

As you take your first tentative steps down the shadowy path, a figure emerges from the gloom. A wild-eyed woman, dressed in tattered hospital garb, lunges at you with a sharpened spoon, her voice a cacophony of anguish and accusation.

"You're the monster, Samarthya!" she shrieks. "You killed them all! Your own family! How could you be so evil?" The ferocity of her attack, fueled by madness or perhaps truth, takes you aback. You stumble backward, barely avoiding the makeshift weapon as it slices the air before you. The commotion alerts Officer Jenkins, who quickly intervenes, pinning her to the ground. "That's enough, Edith," he murmurs, his voice weary. "You know the rules." She turns to look at you, her eyes brimming with tears. "You're just like the others," she whispers hoarsely. "They all say they're not mad here, but we know better." As the guard escorts her back into the asylum, you're left standing there, the cold metal taste of fear in your mouth and the question of your sanity echoing through your mind.

Officer Jenkins, with a mix of annoyance and pity, explains that Edith often confuses patients with the subjects of their nightmares or the news. He assures you that your reputation has preceded you and that it's best to ignore the ramblings of the disturbed. He then leads you into the asylum, down a long, dimly lit corridor to the reception area, where you're processed and given a set of standard-issue clothes and a room key. The walls of the asylum seem to whisper with the echoes of forgotten souls, and the distant cries of other patients add to the oppressive atmosphere. The receptionist, a stern woman named Miss Thornfield, informs you that your doctor, Dr. Castellanos, will see you in the morning. "Dinner's at six," she says curtly. "Your schedule is posted outside your door. Don't miss it." With that, she dismisses you with a flick of her hand.

Once alone in your small, sparsely furnished room, you ponder your predicament. The memory of the events leading to your incarceration remains a foggy haze, filled with images of your family's lifeless forms and a sense of horror that you can't quite explain. You decide that you need to prove your innocence, but how? A trial seems like a distant, almost impossible dream in this place where reality seems to bend to the will of madness. But you cling to the hope that somewhere in the labyrinthine corridors of the asylum, there must be a shred of truth that can set you free.

The next day, as the sun casts an eerie glow through the barred windows, you resolve to speak with Dr. Castellanos about your innocence and demand a trial. You dress in the stiff, uncomfortable asylum clothes and make your way to the designated meeting area, feeling a mix of determination and trepidation.

The asylum is a sprawling, Victorian-era building, with high ceilings and long, shadowy corridors. The walls are adorned with peeling wallpaper that seems to whisper secrets of the past. Each room you pass holds its own grim story, as patients in various states of distress rock in their chairs or murmur to themselves. Some watch you with a mix of curiosity and fear, while others seem lost in their own tormented worlds. The air is thick with the scent of disinfectant, trying to mask the underlying odor of despair.

You arrive at the meeting area, a cold, sterile room with a single table and two chairs. Dr. Castellanos, a middle-aged woman with a severe bob and piercing gaze, sits behind the table, her fingers steepled. She looks up as you enter, her expression unreadable. "Good morning, Samarthya," she says, her voice calm and measured. "I've been expecting you." She opens a file in front of her, filled with your medical records and psychological evaluations. "You've been quite the topic of discussion around here."

You take a seat opposite her, your hands clenching into fists in your lap. "I didn't do it," you assert, your voice stronger than you feel. "I need a trial. I need to prove my innocence."

Dr. Castellanos leans back in her chair, her eyes studying you intently. "A trial, you say?" she muses. "Well, I suppose we could arrange something... within the confines of the asylum, of course." There's a hint of a smile playing on her lips, but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. "We can't have you out in the real world causing trouble, can we?"

Your heart races at the prospect, hope flickering in your chest. "Thank you," you say, trying to keep the desperation from your voice. "I'll do anything to prove it."

Dr. Castellanos's smile widens, but it feels more like a challenge than an offer of help. "Very well," she says, tapping her fingers on the table. "But first, we must understand your... condition. You see, insanity is a slippery slope, Samarthya. Sometimes the mind plays tricks on us, and we're not always in control of our own reality. Tell me, what do you remember from that night?"

You take a deep breath and recount the fragments of memory that haunt your every waking moment. The laughter, the screams, the blood... it's all there, as vivid as ever, but there's something missing. A piece of the puzzle that you can't quite put your finger on. You look into her eyes, searching for a glimmer of belief or understanding, but all you find is a cold, professional curiosity.

"I remember... I remember a gathering," you begin, your voice shaking. "A family dinner. We were all sitting around the table. The conversation was light, filled with the usual banter and love. And then... it changed. The room grew dark, the air thick with tension. I felt a... a pressure, like something was pushing down on me. And then..." You pause, your heart racing as you try to grasp the elusive images.

Dr. Castellanos leans forward, her eyes never leaving yours. "And then what, Samarthya?" she prompts gently, her tone betraying a hint of excitement.

You swallow hard, the lump in your throat almost choking you. "And then... I remember standing on a chair, my hands tied behind my back, a rope around my neck," you say, the words coming out in a rush. "My family... they were hanging... all of them. I could see their faces, twisted in pain and fear, but I couldn't move. It was like I was watching a play, a horrific play that I was somehow a part of but couldn't control."

Dr. Castellanos's expression remains impassive, but her eyes gleam with something you can't quite place. "Interesting," she says, scribbling notes on her pad. "The mind can indeed play tricks. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We'll explore these memories in depth during our sessions. For now, let's focus on your immediate environment." She gestures around the room. "Do you find the asylum... comforting or disturbing?"

You look around, the reality of your surroundings hitting you like a sledgehammer. The stark white walls, the heavy door with the small, barred window, the single light bulb flickering above the tableâ€”everything about this place screams 'imprisonment.' "Disturbing," you admit, your voice barely above a whisper.

"Good," Dr. Castellanos says, her eyes still on her notes. "That's a normal reaction to an abnormal environment. Now, I need you to be honest with me, Samarthya. Have you experienced any... hallucinations since your arrival?"

You think back to the whispers in the corridor, the shadows that seem to move when you're not looking, and the feeling of being watched. But you hesitate. Admitting to hallucinations might just reinforce their belief that you're insane. "No," you lie, trying to sound as convincing as possible. "Everything's been... fine."

Dr. Castellanos looks up, her gaze piercing through you. "Are you certain?" she asks, her voice a low purr. "Sometimes, our minds protect us from the truth. It's nothing to be ashamed of, Samarthya. It's just a part of the healing process."

You nod, trying to appear nonchalant despite the fear clawing at your insides. "I'm sure," you say firmly, hoping to convince her - and perhaps yourself - of your sanity.

Dr. Castellanos seems to consider your response for a moment before closing your file with a soft click. "Very well," she says, standing up. "We'll proceed with the trial preparations. But remember, Samarthya, honesty is the key to unlocking the truth. If you experience anything out of the ordinary, anything at all, you will tell me." It's not a question, but a command. You nod again, the weight of her gaze pressing down on you like a physical force.

The days that follow are a blur of therapy sessions, group activities, and medication. The asylum's routine is a monotonous grind that seems designed to wear down your resistance, making you question your own perception of reality. During these sessions, you learn to keep your thoughts to yourself, to hide the fear and doubt that gnaw at you like a ravenous beast. You observe the other patients, their reactions to the asylum's strange environment, and their interactions with the staff. You're looking for anything that could help your case, any shred of evidence that might prove your innocence..

Days turn into weeks, and the trial looms closer. You spend every waking moment piecing together the fragmented puzzle of your memories, desperate to find something that could exonerate you. During this time, you become acutely aware of the power dynamics within the asylum. The nurses and orderlies wield their authority with a mix of care and cruelty, and the patients, in their various states of madness, are both pawns in a larger game and potential allies or enemies.

The day of the trial arrives, and the asylum's auditorium is transformed into a makeshift courtroom. The air is thick with anticipation, a stark contrast to the usual miasma of despair that clings to the walls. You're escorted into the room, the cold metal of the handcuffs biting into your wrists as you're led to the defendant's chair. The jury, composed of patients and staff, stare at you with a mix of pity and accusation. Dr. Castellanos sits at the judge's bench, her expression as unreadable as ever.

The prosecutor, a stern-looking man with a sharp nose and a thick mustache, stands up and addresses the "court." "We are here to determine the fate of Samarthya, accused of the heinous crime of murdering her entire family," he says, his voice booming in the cavernous room. "The evidence is clear: the bodies of her eleven family members were found in her home, and she was discovered at the scene, with no coherent explanation for the events that unfolded." His words feel like a noose tightening around your neck, the very fabric of the room seeming to constrict with each syllable.

Dr. Castellanos, now playing the role of judge, nods solemnly. "Very well," she says, her voice echoing in the stillness. "Let the defense present its case."

You stand, your legs trembling beneath you, and face the jury. The eyes that bore into you are a mix of the mad, the desperate, and the indifferent. "Your honor," you begin, your voice shaking. "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what I'm about to tell you is the truth, as I remember it." You take a deep breath, trying to steady your nerves. "That night was not what it seems. It was a masquerade of despair and pain, a twisted play of fate that I was forced to endure." You recount the night of the tragedy, describing the dinner, the sudden shift in the air, and the horrific sight of your family hanging from the rafters. Each word feels like a knife to your soul, but you push through, needing to be heard.

The prosecutor, Mr. Thackery, crosses his arms, his skepticism palpable. "And why, pray tell, were your hands bound behind your back?" he sneers, his tone thick with disdain.

You swallow hard, trying to keep your voice steady. "I don't know," you admit. "But I didn't do it. I woke up to that sight, as horrifying and inexplicable as it is. I swear on their graves that I am not the monster you all think I am."

Mr. Thackery paces back and forth in front of the jury, his face contorted into a theatrical scowl. "And how do we trust the word of someone who claims to have no memory of the actual act, yet recounts a tale so vividly?" he challenges. "Is this not the fabrication of a deranged mind, desperate to avoid the consequences of its actions?"

You meet his gaze, feeling the eyes of the courtroom on you like a physical pressure. "I know it sounds unbelievable," you admit, your voice wavering. "But I swear to you all, I did not commit those murders. I would never hurt the people I love."

A murmur ripples through the audience, a mix of doubt and sympathy. Dr. Castellanos raps her gavel on the desk, bringing the room back to order. "We must remain objective," she reminds the jury. "Consider the evidence, not just the emotional appeal."

The defense attorney, a kind-faced young woman named Ms. Fairweather, stands up to address the room. "Your honor, I'd like to present a piece of evidence that could shed light on the events of that night." She holds up a tattered diary, its pages yellowed with age. "This was found in Samarthya's possession upon her admission. It contains entries that suggest a shared delusion, a family curse that could have driven each member to take their own life in such a gruesome fashion."

Mr. Thackery snatches the diary from her hand, flipping through the pages with a sneer. "This is hardly evidence," he scoffs. "It's the ramblings of a madwoman, trying to justify her own madness."

Ms. Fairweather remains unfazed, her grip on the podium tightening. "On the contrary, it provides insight into Samarthya's state of mind and the environment she was in. It also brings up a very crucial detail that the prosecution seems to have overlooked." She pauses for dramatic effect, her gaze sweeping over the jury. "The chairs found beneath each body. The meticulous way their hands were tied, as if they were... assisting in their own demise."

The room falls silent, the tension thick as a fog rolling in from the sea. The jurors exchange puzzled glances, their expressions shifting from disgust to curiosity. Dr. Castellanos leans forward, her eyes narrowing. "Please elaborate, counselor."

Ms. Fairweather nods solemnly. "Thank you, your honor. The diary entries suggest that each member of Samarthya's family was suffering from a shared delusion, a curse that had plagued their lineage for generations. It's possible that in their collective madness, they believed that death was the only way to free themselves from this torment. The chairs, meticulously placed, indicate a level of planning and acceptance that's consistent with suicide rather than murder."

Mr. Thackery snorts derisively. "And what of the rope burns on their necks? Does she expect us to believe that they all decided to hang themselves at the exact same time, in the exact same way?"

Ms. Fairweather's gaze never wavers. "We are not here to prove that a curse exists, Mr. Thackery, but rather to explore the possibility that Samarthya's family was driven to take such drastic measures by a collective delusion. It is well-documented that shared psychological trauma can manifest in similar ways across individuals. The burns could have been self-inflicted, a tragic testament to their belief in the curse's power."

Mr. Thackery sneers as he takes the podium, his eyes glinting with malice. "Ah, the grand theory of a family curse," he says, waving the diary in the air. "How convenient for our dear Samarthya to have such a neat explanation for her own survival. If this... this 'curse' was so powerful, so all-consuming, why wasn't she affected? Why wasn't she found hanging alongside her kin?" He pauses, allowing the question to hang in the air like a specter. "No, your honor, this is the desperate attempt of a guilty mind to weave a narrative of innocence where there is none."

You feel your knees tremble as his words cut through the air, but you hold his gaze, refusing to let him see your fear. "I don't know why I survived," you murmur, your voice barely audible. "But I do know that I didn't do it."

Ms. Fairweather nods to you, then turns to the jury. "What we do know is that Samarthya was found at the scene, bound and traumatized. It's not unheard of for someone to survive a traumatic event and have their mind protect them from the memory of their own actions. But the evidence we've presented suggests that the truth may be much more complex than what's on the surface." She places the diary on the table before the jury. "Consider the possibility that the curse was a manifestation of their shared despair, a collective break from reality that led them to this tragic end."

The room remains silent for a moment before Dr. Castellanos speaks. "Very well," she says, her voice calm. "We've heard the defense's theory. Now, let's bring in someone who was present on the night in question, someone who can offer a more... objective perspective." She nods to Officer Jenkins, who stands and leaves the room, returning shortly with a man in a crumpled suit, his face lined with fatigue.

The man, introduced as Inspector Crowther, takes the stand, his eyes meeting yours briefly before they dart away, as if unable to hold the weight of your gaze. His voice is gruff as he recounts the grisly scene he discovered at your family's home. "The place was a slaughterhouse," he says, his tone heavy. "And there she was, in the midst of it all, her hands bound behind her back, laughing. It was... it was unnerving, like nothing I've ever seen before."

You feel the noose tighten further around your neck, the room spinning around you. Laughing? You had no memory of that. The realization hits you like a punch in the gut, leaving you gasping for air. "That's not true," you murmur, your voice barely audible.

Inspector Crowther's gaze flickers back to you, his expression grim. "I'm sorry, miss," he says, his voice heavy with regret. "But that's what I saw. You were lying beside the chair, your eyeballs rolled up so that only the white was showin'. And you were laughin'. A laugh that chilled me to the bone."

The room feels suffocating as the jury and audience exchange uneasy glances. Dr. Castellanos's eyes bore into you, a mix of curiosity and accusation. "Is there anything you wish to add, Samarthya?" she asks, her tone deceptively calm.

You struggle to breathe, the weight of the room pressing down on your chest like a boulder. "I... I don't remember laughing," you manage to croak out, your voice trembling. "But if that's what you saw, I... I can't argue with it." The doubt in your own mind is a living, breathing entity, threatening to consume you whole.

Ms. Fairweather, noticing your distress, quickly jumps in. "Perhaps, Inspector Crowther, the scene was so disturbing that your senses were heightened, and the sounds of the fire or the crackling of the floorboards could have been mistaken for laughter?" Her voice is hopeful, a lifeline thrown into the dark waters of accusation.

Inspector Crowther rubs his stubbled chin, looking thoughtful. "It's possible," he concedes, though his eyes betray his doubt. "But the scene was... it was something out of a nightmare. And the way she was just... there, not fighting, not screaming, just... laughing." His voice trails off, leaving the room to fill with the unspoken horror of his recollection.

Dr. Castellanos nods slowly, her eyes never leaving yours. "Very well," she says, her voice low and deliberate. "Let us explore this further." She motions to a corner of the room where an object, previously obscured by a velvet curtain, is revealed: a blackened goat's head, its eyes vacant and eerie. "Is this what you saw, Inspector?"

Inspector Crowther's face pales as he nods. "Yes, ma'am," he says, his voice tight. "It was right next to the fireplace, along with a dead owl, some weird lines drawn on the floor, and... twelve skulls. It looked like some sort of twisted ritual."

The murmurs of the audience crescendo into a cacophony of horror, and even Dr. Castellanos seems taken aback. You stare at the goat's head, a cold chill creeping up your spine. It's a macabre prop that seems to confirm the madness that everyone believes you're a part of. But the memory of that night is as murky as the smoke that had filled your lungs when you first woke up to the carnage. "I don't remember any of that," you murmur, feeling the noose tighten further. "But... I can't say it's not possible."

Ms. Fairweather's eyes widen with concern as she looks from the goat's head to you, then back at the jury. "Your honor, it's clear that the scene was disturbing, but let's not jump to conclusions. The presence of such items does not necessarily indicate guilt. It could have been staged, a twisted prank or... or the work of someone else entirely." Her voice is shaky, but she stands her ground.

Mr. Thackery's smug expression returns. "Ah, yes, the 'someone else' defense," he says, his voice thick with sarcasm. "How convenient for our dear Samarthya to have forgotten such a key detail. Twelve skulls, a symbol of the family's twelve members, and she just happened to survive the carnage. How very lucky of her."

You stumble over your own thoughts, trying to piece together a coherent argument, but the words won't come. The room seems to tilt, the noose around your neck tightening with every second that ticks by. "I... I didn't do it," you manage to choke out, the desperation in your voice clear as day. "I don't remember any of it, but I swear, I didn't do it."

Ms. Fairweather, sensing your distress, steps forward to address the jury. "Ladies and gentlemen, the presence of these items does not equate to Samarthya's guilt. The true question we must ask ourselves is, who else had access to her home that night? Who else could have staged such a horrific scene?"Her words hang in the air like a lifeline thrown into a stormy sea, and the murmurs of the audience begin to shift, the tide of opinion swelling with uncertainty.

Dr. Castellanos nods for the proceedings to continue, and Mr. Thackery, with a dramatic flourish, opens the file that has just been handed to him. His eyes widen, and his smug smile fades, replaced by a look of genuine shock.

It was a file that had just entered the court room with something written on the top, " FORENSIC REPORT"

Mr. Thackery, the prosecutor, flips through the forensic report with a visibly shaking hand, his eyes darting back and forth across the pages as he reads. His face pales, and he looks up at you, his earlier confidence visibly wavering. "Your honor," he stammers, "this... this changes everything." He hands the report to Dr. Castellanos, who reads it quickly, her expression unreadable.

The room seems to hold its breath as Dr. Castellanos looks up from the report. "Samarthya," she says, her voice cold and detached, "it appears that your fingerprints have been found on the knife used to cut the goat's head. Moreover, the blood samples at the scene match your blood type. Can you explain this?"

Everyone was shocked as in my medical report , there was no signs of any marks or scars that suggests any potential injuries that has caused the major spill over of my blood at the crime scene

The revelation of your fingerprints on the knife and the matching blood type sends a wave of shock through the courtroom. The whispers of the audience crescendo into a murmur of accusation, and even some of the jury members exchange doubtful glances. Dr. Castellanos's eyes bore into you, her expression inscrutable. The noose around your neck feels tighter than ever, as the room seems to close in on you, the walls whispering of your guilt.

You struggle to find the words, your mind racing. "No," you manage to say, your voice shaking. "I... I don't remember handling a knife, or... or seeing any of those things that night." Your heart hammers in your chest, a desperate rhythm echoing the doubt that now clouds your mind. "It's not possible."

Dr. Castellanos looks up from the report, her gaze sharp and searching. "But it's clear, Samarthya," she says, her voice steady despite the chaos around her. "The evidence does not lie. Your fingerprints, your blood... it's all there."

You feel your legs give out beneath you, and the room swims as the noose tightens even further. "But I swear, I don't remember," you repeat, your voice a whisper of desperation.

Ms. Fairweather, your defense attorney, jumps to her feet, her eyes wide with a mix of shock and determination. "Your honor," she says, her voice quavering slightly, "the presence of Samarthya's fingerprints and blood type at the scene does not necessarily prove guilt. It is clear that there are elements of this case that we do not yet understand. The absence of injuries on Samarthya's body  suggests that their might be a different angle involved to this"

Dr. Castellanos regards Ms. Fairweather for a long moment, her expression unreadable. "Very well," she says slowly, her words measured and deliberate. "Given the unusual nature of the evidence and the lack of clear motive, I concede that there may be more to this story than what meets the eye. We will re-examine the crime scene and conduct further investigation into the events of that night."

The courtroom seems to exhale in relief, the tension dissipating slightly. You feel a glimmer of hope, a thread to cling to amidst the chaos. "Thank you, your honor," Ms. Fairweather says, her voice strong once more. "We ask that you consider the possibility that Samarthya may have been an unfortunate victim in all of this."

Mr. Thackery, visibly rattled, collects himself. "Your honor," he says, his voice regaining its usual confidence, "the evidence is clear. We cannot ignore the facts laid before us. The accused has admitted to not remembering the events, yet her fingerprints are all over the murder weapon." He pauses for effect, letting the gravity of his words sink in. "And let us not forget the nature of the crime: a brutal, ritualistic slaying of eleven innocent souls. If she did not do it, who did?"

Ms. Fairweather remains undeterred. "The accused has been through a traumatic ordeal," she counters, her voice calm but firm. "The lack of memory is consistent with a severe psychological trauma. We must consider that the accused's mind could have blocked out the true events for their own protection."

Dr. Castellanos nods thoughtfully, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for an unseen truth. "This case is indeed unusual," she acknowledges. "We will adjourn to review the new evidence and consider the implications." She bangs her gavel, signaling the end of the session. The room buzzes with whispers as the audience shuffles out, leaving you feeling more lost than ever.And then suddenly every voice around you vanishes , the colourful world becomes all black and you have no control on your muscles. You crumple to the floor, unconscious, leaving the courtroom in stunned silence

As you open your eyes, you realised you are in a hospital with Ms Fairweather by your side, her eyes filled with concern. "Sam, are you okay? " She asks, her voice filled with worry. You try to nod, but even that seems like a Herculean task."Sam, we need to talk," she says urgently, her voice low. "Past one month have changed everything, since you were in coma. Things are much worst now"
