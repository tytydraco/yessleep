I found the apartment on short notice. It was cheap, fully furnished, and in a decent neighborhood—too good to be true. But when you’re broke and desperate, you don’t ask too many questions.

The landlord was eager to get me in. No long application process, no credit check. Just a handshake, a set of keys, and one offhand comment as he left. **“Don’t move the mirror.”**

At first, I barely noticed it. The mirror was old, full-length, and bolted to the wall in the bedroom. The frame was an intricate swirl of black metal, and the glass had that slightly warped look, like it belonged in an antique shop. It seemed out of place in the otherwise modern apartment, but I wasn’t about to argue over decor.

The first night, I slept fine. The second night, I noticed something strange.

I had just finished brushing my teeth when I glanced at the mirror on my closet door. The bedroom mirror was reflected in it—but something was **off**. In my reflection, the bolted mirror looked… darker, like the glass was thicker, absorbing the light instead of reflecting it. I turned to look at it directly, but it seemed normal. Maybe I was just imagining things.

By the third night, I knew I wasn’t imagining anything.

I woke up around 3 AM, uneasy, like something had yanked me out of sleep. The room was quiet, except for the hum of the fridge from the kitchen. I turned over, facing the mirror.

There was **someone in it.**

Not my reflection. **Someone else.**

They stood just inside the frame, in the exact spot where my reflection should’ve been—tall, thin, wearing dark clothes. Their face was **wrong**, blurred, like a smudged painting.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

Then, slowly, the figure **tilted its head.**

My paralysis broke. I fumbled for the lamp, knocking over my water bottle in the process. Light flooded the room.

The mirror was empty.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, I convinced myself it had been a dream—sleep paralysis, a trick of the dark. I almost managed to believe it. Almost.

Until I checked my phone.

There was a **new photo in my camera roll**. Taken at **3:02 AM**.

It was a picture of me.

Asleep.

And in the reflection of the mirror—**the figure was standing over my bed.**

I got out of there so fast I barely remembered to grab my wallet. I spent the day in a coffee shop, trying to figure out what to do. I didn’t know how to explain it to anyone. "Hey, my mirror is haunted, can I crash on your couch?" didn’t exactly sound sane.

By evening, exhaustion won over fear. I told myself I’d spend **one more night**, just enough time to grab my stuff and find somewhere else. I’d sleep with all the lights on. I wouldn’t look at the mirror.

I should have just left.

I woke up in total **darkness**.

My bedside lamp was off. My phone was dead. The air felt thick, heavy, pressing down on me like I was being **watched.**

I turned toward the mirror.

The figure was there.

But this time, it wasn’t just standing inside the mirror.

It was **stepping out.**

One long, pale hand **gripped the edge of the frame**, then another. A leg emerged, movements slow and deliberate, like something unused to a body. I tried to scream, to move, to **do anything**—but I was frozen in place, suffocating under a weight I couldn’t see.

The figure pulled itself free from the glass, unfolding to its full, **unnatural height**. Its blurred face **sharpened**, forming features that shouldn’t exist. **That shouldn’t belong to me.**

It was **me**.

But not.

A twisted, hollow version. Eyes too dark. Mouth stretched too wide. Movements too smooth, like a puppet without strings.

It **smiled.**

And then it spoke.

**“Your turn.”**

The last thing I remember is its hands reaching for me.

I woke up to sunlight streaming through the window. My phone buzzed on the nightstand—**fully charged**. The room was exactly as it had been when I first moved in. The mirror was still bolted to the wall.

But something was **wrong.**

Everything felt **too perfect.** The sheets were crisp. My clothes were neatly folded. Even the water bottle I knocked over was standing upright. Like someone had reset the scene.

Like I was in **its** place now.

I stumbled to the bathroom and turned on the sink. Splashed cold water on my face. Looked up at the mirror.

And that’s when I knew.

**The reflection wasn’t mine.**
