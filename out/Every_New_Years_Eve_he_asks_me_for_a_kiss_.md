What is the most powerful thing on this mortal coil?


The yearning. The desperate, blazing, white hot flame for someone who is no longer tangible. The bated breath of a human frame shuddering, gasping, desperate for someone beyond the veil. 


For it is a thin veil, but nonetheless it remains. 


Yearning. Yearning…
Calling out…
Begging…


Beyond the grave. 


And he came to me. 


Nightly. 


Rapping upon my window. 


Whispering upon the wind as it drifts through the screen…


Alejandro.

We were childhood friends. 
Best friends. 


The kind of best friends who only fuel each other’s fire but always fiercely protective of one another. People used to mistake us for siblings, that’s how close we were. You know I read somewhere that the more time you spend around a person the more you start to resemble one another. Perhaps that was just the case. 


Alejandro was older than me, by three years so we didn’t really have classes together. Instead we met through mutual friends and ended up in the same group and around the same dealers. 


We were destructive together, even if I did my best to hold him down and keep him safe. It became symbolic, I cleaned up his messes and he kept me supplied and safe. It’s good to have a man around who isn’t inherently after you especially when you’re under the influence in shady places. That’s not to say we didn’t share sins on accidental occasions but that isn’t the point. 


We loved each other and we shared an intimacy that transcended the physical. There are other deeper types of intimacy than being inside one another within the mortal coil. 


Perhaps that’s why every year on New Year’s Eve he shows up. 


Alejandro has been dead for nearly 10 years now. 


He died of an overdose long after I made my stint in rehab. His girlfriend at the time had unknowingly administered a lethal dose into his veins upon his instruction. I always knew this would be his fate, after all I’d seen him and many others overdose in front of me before. It’s just what happens when you run a certain circle. 


But my Alejandro was invincible right? 


Time passed, many slights happen as do when loved ones pass. It’s too much to get into and not exactly relevant. But I will say he wasn’t buried according to his wishes nor was he buried in a way that followed his family religion. 


It started right away. 


Every passing man


every driver


the customers at work


They all looked like him. 


But I was in a state of grief. I knew better than to trust myself when in that state. 


Then he showed up outside my window in the fall on Halloween. 


And ever since then he shows up at my door every New Years Eve. 


My name is Verona. Alejandro is the Man I love. This is the New Year’s Eve where we finally share a midnight kiss. 


Every year he knocks and begs for me to meet him. Begs for my lips, my kiss, my comfort. His voice is smooth but his body is stiff from death. His eyes are still a vibrant amber but his lips are blue and discolored. There’s too much expression in his eyes and not enough on the musculature of his face. His clothes are new and clean but his skin is peppered with burn marks. 


He was cremated after all. 


 My name is Verona. 


Alejandro is the Man I love. 


This is the New Year’s Eve where we finally share a midnight kiss. 


I’m leaving this notebook behind so that my family and loved ones and all the world can understand why.
