I was hiking in the evening, up a mountain in my area. The sun was setting and I was trying to hike up and get a decent view, like I had done several times before.

This evening was different the air had that charge that comes before a thunderstorm, with that electric almost metallic smell in the air. Of course there was no signs of storms in my area and even if there were, I live in an area that gets very little rain and almost no storms. Your more likely to have a dust storm than an actual one.

As I exited my vehicle at the base of the trail I was going to hike, I made mental note of the smell and strapped on my hiking pack. At this point it was about an hour before sunset and only 20-30 minutes up the trail to the spot that I get the best vantage point. 
 
The hike up there was mostly uneventful, but as I hiked up to my spot I felt a sense of unease creep up on me. Like I said I had taken this trail several times before, usually to calm down and relax, but now it felt foreign like an alien planet and I was stepping on ground not touched yet by man.

Even the animals could sense there was something wrong. I normally heard insects start their nightly song at this time but now, the only noises I heard were all from me, my heart beat, my breath, and the sound of gravel beneath my feet. before I realized it, I had stopped moving too, I stood completely still almost by instinct. my breath caught in my throat and my ears filled with the sound of nothing. thousands of tiny noises should have been there, yet only the blood pumping through my ears reminded me that I wasn't deaf.

At this point my hike was over. I hadn't reached the point I wanted to in the trail, but it didn't matter, fear had taken over and I could no longer step forward towards this "feeling". I stood there motionless for what felt like hours, sweat began to build on my brow. finally, after convincing myself to turn around, I took a few slow and carful step backwards. 

But I should have been faster, I should have never stayed for so long, hell I never should have left my car. 

As I took my few measured steps back, the sky went dark. The sun shouldn't be setting for another 30 or more minutes and never so fast. but here the sky went black, no moon, no stars, no time to run away. 

I turned and ran anyways but it was too late, everywhere I looked the sky had been blanketed by darkness. and as I sprinted, noise came back.  at first it was low and slow, almost unnoticeable, I know I didn't notice until all I heard was a single low note, that echoed through my ears and vibrated my bones bones.

then the light came. not the loving warm glow of the sun. But an etheric blue glow that lit up the once dark sky and was warm, warmer than the sun. And it tingled.

as I looked up at it.....as I looked up at it. I could.... and it felt so...so...

and then it was gone, the light, the darkness, the frequency, and me. I still stood there on the hill, the sun now actually set and the stars and moon began to show. but... I still felt it. I started puking and gagging instantly, my body burning all the while. 

I look down at my hands and see red sun burn like marks on my palms and fingers where I was trying to shield my face, which now also stung. I start running and tripping over myself to get to my car. But once I got there It got worse.

I began puking, again, this time more violently and there was red in it. my heart sank at the realization, it's blood. I puked again. more blood and...I felt around in my mouth with my tongue and there on my right side where my head was turned towards the light, my teeth were gone and in the puddle of puke, sitting there, were my missing molars.

my head pounded, and my nose began to run, wiping it revealed more blood. finally sitting down by the hood of my car I got my phone out for the first time during all of this. I can feel myself going loopy. my thoughts are becoming more harder to write down.

I don't even know if what I remember is correct or some approximation. something is leaking out of my ear. I checked with my finger but all I felt was mush. my nails are coming off now. They just peel right off like a sticker, I can even stick them on my shirt and pack. Now I have such pretty red fingers.

I think I messed up.....I don't know why I'm here...I think I messed up...maybe I should have called someone.......
