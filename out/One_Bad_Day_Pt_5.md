  Sorry for the delay but me and B are okay just been traveling around keeping on the move incase “they” catch up 

To start off after the last incident where we went into hiding we had to head to Texas because Beezle
 “had a funny feeling” 
which I guess is reason enough for a Angel fallen or not…

While In Texas, B said he thinks it’s something called a Rögner, never heard of it but from the description B gave it sounds almost like a werewolf but half demon instead of half man which would’ve been horrifying enough

After a lengthy explanation which involves having to cut their head off with a gold blade of some sort that B conveniently had tucked somewhere in his suit, starting to think he has pocket dimension… literally 

Then we waited for night fall in a not to shabby bar, we talked to locals (although discreetly) about any weird animal attacks or odd legends which then pointed us towards a forest about 5 miles north of the bar

According to the locals “There’s some odd shit going on in the woods, I hear of a beast the size of 5 men” one drunk said when another chimed in “ain’t nothing a 308 can’t fix” 

Me and B shared a chuckle at that one as we walked out to head towards the woods and set up some sort of plan

Beezle set out “meat” as a bait that I was pretty sure was human but honestly didn’t want to know for sure

We climbed some tree, and just sat and waited for well anything, when we heard something barreling through the forest knocking down some trees in the distant thud after thud until the beast flew out of a bush and crashed against our tree toppling it over 

“FUCK!” We yelled in unison as we slammed into the ground

When the Rögner turned to face us stomping over on its hind legs 

Winded and hurt I let out a breathless yell (more of a wheeze If I’m being honest) as I saw the atleast 7 foot beast standing over us, it’s fur was stained red and patchy, a head that resembled a wolf but was scarred and bruised, with brownish looking saliva oozing from its mouth

It let out a ear deafening roar as it bent down and lifted me by my leg, B shot up to his feet dusting himself off saying something about him wearing a new suit and it being a crime to get muddy as he walked towards the beast but honestly was only half listening as I was well scared shitless to be honest

Beezle attempted to pull the blade from his pocket when the creature saw and sent me flying into Beezle which In turn sent us barreling into a tree which caused me to black out for a few moments, waking up to Beezle telling me to get up as he pushed me off him, slipping the blade into my hand

Pushing himself up he charges the beast slamming his shoulder into the creature causing them both to fall to the ground

I grab the tree closest to me and slowly lift myself off the ground the whole time B is yelling at me to “hurry the fuck up!” While he attempts to hold the best down, limping over I grip the blade and swing down onto the creature when it loosens his arm from B’s grip and slashes my leg clean off

“We’ll fuck” B says as I topple over screaming in pain

Rolling himself back onto the creature he screams at me to pass him the blade, trying to pull myself together long enough to inch myself closer I toss the blade to Beezle

Now holding one arm down with a knee he catches the blade and puts the blade to its neck grabbing both the hilt and blade he pushes it deeper and deeper into the creatures neck, wimpering the beast tosses and turns unable to stop its inevitable demise as he chops its head clean off

Panting B falls to the ground I’m assuming to catch his breath then lifts himself to his feet and ofcourse dusting off his now somehow clean suit

“We’ll this is an issue, now we have to wait to look for the next job” 
he bluntly states as he walks towards me

Slipping in and out of consciousness I pass out to awake in a hotel bathtub Beezle standing beside me 

“Don’t worry, it’ll heal”-B says calmly

“I’m not sure if you know this but humans don’t just regrow limbs” I say admittedly bitter

“Yea but demons do” he says giving me one last wink before I slip out of consciousness
