When I was younger, I had a dream that I was exploring an abandoned, run-down village house with a group of people. I remembered that while exploring the area a few days before, I saw a girl with long hair covering most of her face, standing alone in an empty room, staring at a flower in her hand. She wore thin, shabby clothes, and had sunken, sad-looking eyes. I was intrigued by her, so I approached her and asked why she wasn't with the rest of the group, and she said something cryptic which I couldn't remember. I shook off the memory and kept exploring.  
I walked through a corridor and overheard some people in another room talking about how that same girl from my memory ended up committing suicide a day or two ago, and that she had been really depressed for some time. I asked how she died, and they said there was this dark abandoned shaft somewhere where she hung herself. My legs were already walking me out of the house before I could make the decision to leave.   


I got insanely chilled and felt extremely guilty that I didn't do anything to help her in her last days, but before I could even finish that thought, I fell. I slipped through a scantily covered hole in the floorboards and was falling down a huge drop... in a dark abandoned shaft... the very same mentioned by the group of people. Luckily, part of my clothes got caught on a rope hanging from the top, and I was alone in the pitch black, clammy, unbearably eerie space, dangling above a couple of rocks and other sharp objects waiting ominously at the bottom.   


I strained my neck upwards and realised that the rope was a noose. It must've taken me about three, horrible, heart-dropping seconds to realise it was the very same rope the strange girl used to hang herself. But by far, the worst realisation was the realisation that her body could have still been down there somewhere. The intense dread and horror that ran through me was honestly insane for a dream. I began to scream and plead for help, begging the world to not leave me alone in the horribly silent cavern, potentially near a corpse.

My prayers were partially answered, because it wasn't silent for much longer.   


I began to hear horrible staggered breathing and groans from a few feet below me, and I recognised it as the girl i talked to before. She was *still alive*. I immediately deduced that when she used this rope to hang herself, it must have slipped and dropped her onto the sharp, jagged rocks below. Remember how I said it was a huge drop? The drop from the noose to the rocks would not have been enough to kill her on impact, but enough to render her mutilated from injury and unable to call for help. That means she would have been laying there alone, horribly disfigured and in excruciating pain, starved, and kept (barely) alive the whole time. For God knows how long, and God knows how close to me. The deep, visceral, fear and dread that I felt in that moment was unlike any other emotion I had ever felt in a dream before, and honestly maybe even in real life. I frequently have quite disturbing dreams, some maybe more disturbing in content, but none of them evoked an emotional response as strong as this.

I started screaming so hard for help and trying my very best to not look down and be forced to see how mangled and putrefied the girl was. Thankfully the people from inside the house found me and pulled me out by the rope. I remember feeling so wildly relieved, but simultaneously being filled with so much guilt and remorse for leaving her down there, despite her being alive and in desperate need of help. Perhaps even worse, betrayed by the one person who listened to her troubles, not once, but twice. Before her suicide and after. The best way I can describe the cinematography and atmosphere of that dream was like some analog horror film banned in the USSR type of thing. Watch "Steamed Hams but its banned in the USSR" on YouTube, its a silly meme video but I swear the style was so similar to my dream. I honest to God have never felt so viscerally uneasy and traumatised after waking up from a dream in my life.

Cut to the present. A few weeks ago, I began getting super interested in genealogy and uncovering stories regarding my family history. I was having a conversation with my aunt about the lore in her and my dad's side of the family. Most of what I knew about them was that they were poor and had a family history of emotional trouble. She mentioned that a few generations ago, a girl in their family in the countryside died tragically young, and quite gruesomely. How?   


She was fetching water from a huge, deep well in their old, run-down village and fell down the shaft when the rope wouldn't catch her. Thankfully, unlike the girl from my dream, she was already dead when they found her.   


But my aunt never told me how many days it took to find her.   


*(This is a true story guys.)*
