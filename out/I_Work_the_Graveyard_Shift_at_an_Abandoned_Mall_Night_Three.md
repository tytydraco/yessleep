**July 3rd: "The Third Night"**

I bolt upright in bed, gasping for breath. My sheets are damp with sweat, the air in my room thick and unmoving. My pulse pounds against my skull. I swallow hard, pressing my palms against the mattress, grounding myself.

*It was just a dream.*

That’s what I tell myself.

The clock on my nightstand reads 4:02 AM. The same time as when I first got into bed. The same time it was when I tried to leave the mall. I rub my eyes, groggy, and reach for my phone. No new notifications. No calls. I open my contacts, my boss, my coworkers, anyone I could call to tell them I’m done.

No names. Just a blank screen.

The radio hums softly from the corner of the room. I don’t remember turning it on. I turn the dial, but every station is the same: static, layered with whispers. I glance toward the window, expecting to see the familiar glow of streetlights, the occasional car passing by. Instead, my neighborhood is frozen. No movement. No wind. No people. Something isn’t right.

Then my phone buzzes, vibrating violently against my nightstand. I snatch it up.

Unknown Number: *"Night Three. You need to see."*

My stomach drops. I try to steady my breathing, but it’s useless. Then I see it. My fingers are clutching something… something I don’t remember picking up. The security log. Open to a new page. My own handwriting.

*"We never left."*

I stagger back from the window, my hand still gripping the security log. The words blur as I read them over and over again. We never left. My heart races. I can feel the weight of panic starting to close in on me, pressing against my chest, suffocating. I force myself to breathe, to focus.

I need to shake this off. I tell myself it’s just a bad dream. It’s all in my head. I push myself up from the bed, trying to find some sense of normalcy. I throw on my jacket, my hands shaking as I grab my car keys from the dresser. Maybe a drive will clear my mind. I can just go out, get some fresh air.

I open the front door. The cool night air hits my face, but something feels wrong. The street is still... too still. There’s no hum of traffic, no distant chatter of neighbors. Just silence. I take a step outside… and I blink. The world shifts. I’m no longer standing on my street.

I’m back in the mall.

The lights hum above me, the air stale, heavy with the scent of old food and dust. My hands are still trembling, but now, they’re gripping the security desk. My uniform is on, the familiar weight of it, and the monitors flicker to life in front of me.

I didn’t drive here. I didn’t unlock the doors. I didn’t…

The PA system crackles. A low hum at first, then a voice, my voice, echoes through the speakers, sounding garbled and far too calm.

“Night Three begins now.”

I freeze; my breath caught in my throat. The voice, my voice, lingers in the empty air, like a weight I can’t escape. This isn’t a dream. This is happening.

I move through the halls, forcing myself to stay calm. But the mall has changed. It isn’t just showing me things anymore: it’s shifting around me. I pass a clothing store, and for a moment, everything seems normal. The shelves are stocked, employees are folding shirts, customers are browsing. The fluorescent lights hum softly. But something is wrong.

The mannequins.

They’re all turned toward me.

Every single one.

I step back, my breath hitching in my throat. The store is still moving, time flowing like it should, but the mannequins don’t belong in it. They’re frozen in place, heads tilted just slightly too much, as if they’re aware of me. I move on, heart pounding.

A sudden burst of laughter echoes down the hall. I turn my head, and a child, no older than seven or eight, darts past me, giggling. Just a blur of motion. But their clothes… they don’t belong here. The faded overalls, the little cap, the worn leather shoes. 1950s.

The child vanishes around a corner before I can react.

I swallow hard, forcing myself to keep walking. I pass a dark storefront, catching a glimpse of my reflection in the glass.

And then I stop.

I take a step forward.

So does my reflection.

But then… It doesn’t.

It lingers. Watching me.

My stomach twists. I turn away, picking up the pace. I need to get out of here. I need to… The food court. I don’t remember walking down the stairs, but I’m already here. And I know immediately: it’s changed. The menus aren’t the same. The names are different. The lettering strange, shifting between languages I don’t recognize. The air is thick with the scent of fresh food. Burgers, fries, sweet cinnamon... like someone just finished eating. But the tables are empty.

Something is feeding here.

And then...

The PA system crackles to life.

The garbled static fades. The voice is clearer now.

And it speaks my name.

I freeze.

The voice is waiting for me.

\*\*\*\*

I force myself to think. To act. The mall is pulling me deeper, twisting around me like a maze with no exit. But there has to be a way to understand it. A way to fight back.

The security office.

I push through the door, flicking on the desk lamp. It barely cuts through the darkness, but I don’t need much light: I need answers. I yank open filing cabinets, flipping through forgotten paperwork, skimming the brittle pages for anything that can explain this place.

And then I find them.

Old newspaper clippings, yellowed and curling at the edges. Stuffed into the back of a drawer like someone wanted them forgotten.

The headlines hit me like a punch to the gut:

MALL CONSTRUCTION HALTED AFTER WORKERS GO MISSING  
CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS LAND PURCHASE: NATIVE GROUPS PROTEST DISTURBED BURIAL SITE  
GRAND OPENING SET FOR JULY 4, 1982

The pieces fall into place, and my stomach turns. This place was never supposed to be built. They buried something when they paved over the past. The land remembers. And it doesn’t forgive.

My hands tremble as I reach for the security log. I don’t remember opening it. I don’t remember writing anything. But there, in the same handwriting as the last entries, is something new.

Night Three. You are part of it now.

I drop the log like it burned me.

I back away.

The PA system crackles.

The voice is louder now.

And it’s laughing.

\*\*\*\*

I’ve made my decision. I don’t care what’s happening. I don’t care about explanations anymore. I’m done. I shove the security log into a drawer, grab my jacket, and head straight for the exit. My footsteps echo too loudly against the tile, bouncing back at me from angles that don’t make sense. The air feels thicker, watching me.

I don’t look at the storefronts.

I don’t check my reflection.

I just walk.

Then—I see it.

Or, I don’t.

The exit is gone.

The glass doors that should lead to the parking lot? Bricked over. Solid. Seamless. As if they were never there.

I spin around, my pulse hammering. Maybe I took a wrong turn. Maybe the mall is just messing with me. I take another hallway, following the glowing EXIT sign. It leads me right back to the security office. I try again. Another hallway. Another door. But no matter which way I go...

I end up back here.

I grip the edge of the desk, struggling to breathe. The cameras flicker, their screens distorting. The food court. The mannequins. The looping halls.

Trapping me.

The PA system clicks on. The speakers crackle, hissing with static.

A voice... low, distorted, right behind me.

*"We never leave."*

\*\*\*\*

My breathing is ragged. The walls feel too close, the air too dense. I can’t be trapped. I can’t be trapped. I stumble back, turning down another hallway, but it’s the same. No exit. No way out. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I catch it... a reflection. A dark storefront window. A warped, glossy surface. My reflection is there. But it’s not moving with me. I freeze. My chest tightens. I lift a shaking hand... it doesn’t. It just stands there. Watching.

Then... it smiles.

A slow, deliberate grin stretches across its face. A smile I didn’t make. My breath catches in my throat as it takes a step forward. Out of the glass.

\*\*\*

I stumble back, my pulse hammering in my ears. The thing that looks like me, but isn’t me, takes another step forward. Its eyes are wrong. Too dark. Too knowing.

Then... movement.

Behind the glass, more figures appear. At first, I think it’s just shadows, just tricks of the dim mall lights.

But no. They look like me.

Not just one. Not just two. Dozens.

All standing in the darkness, watching.

Their faces \*\*my face\*\*are slack, expressionless. Waiting.

The PA system crackles again, the static sharp in my ears.

Then, in a voice I recognize as my own, it speaks one last time:

"*Night Three is complete. Welcome hom*e."
