It was two in the morning when my phone rang its familiar ringtone, waking me up from my deep slumber. I languidly checked to see who it was. It was Bartholomew, my childhood best friend. 

I briefly considered not answering at first, but it was odd for him to call me this late and I got a bit worried. I answered the phone and before I got a chance to say anything, my ears were nuked.

“**DUDE**! You will not believe what just happened.” Bartholomew practically yelled over the phone while sounding out of breath.

“What? You finally got laid?” I groggily replied, feeling pretty annoyed at being woken up so late for something that didn’t seem to be too important.

I met Bartholomew in the first grade and quickly became friends with him given our shared interest in Super Smash Brothers Melee. He’s always been a bit of an outcast thanks to his goofy name, social awkwardness and high levels of geekiness.

I’ve learnt over the years that he has a heart of gold and that he’ll always have my back, a valuable quality that can be hard to find in today’s day and age. 

Despite many people throughout my school years questioning why I'm friends with a dork like him and some even entirely avoiding me due to my friendship with him, I’ve never once thought about distancing myself from him.

“No. It’s something much, much, much better than that. Y’know how I’ve been nagging you about VirtualisXVR for months now? Well, let’s just say that I'm part of a very lucky bunch. Over ninety-thousand people applied and only five-hundred got accepted, including yours truly ” Bartholomew said, with great smugness in his voice.

Nag me about that new and upcoming VR project he very much did. Bart is a technophile that constantly raves about upcoming projects in areas such as VR, gaming, and operating systems, specifically, Linux like the elitist that he is.

It isn’t uncommon for him to bring up several projects to me on a monthly basis to me which makes it hard to remember much of anything when it comes to specifics, but I do remember him being more excited than usual when bringing up VirtualisXVR, which made me focus more than I normally would when he would have a nerdgasm about these sorts of things.

All you need to know for now is that VirtualisXVR is a highly advanced and experimental VR project that’s been in the works for two decades now and aims to revolutionize virtual reality as a whole. The company behind this project is called Surreal Corporation and they’re mostly known for being very secretive with the public.

“You woke me up to tell me that? C’mon man, It seriously couldn’t have waited until morning?”

“No, that’s not all, bro. They didn’t specify so during the application process, but the invite lets you invite one other person to join you, and I don’t know anyone else I'd rather have join me in this than you.” Bartholomew answered. 

I noticed how hopeful he sounded at the idea of trying out VirtualisXVR with me and I couldn’t possibly disappoint him. 

“Sure, we can give it a try first thing tomorrow morning. Just try to get some sleep, yeah? I know you’ve been dying to try this out.” I said while closing my eyes, desperate to go back to sleep. 

“Sounds great! I’ll try to sleep, but it won’t be easy” Bartholomew said while sheepishly chuckling. 

“And sorry for waking you up to tell you this, I just couldn’t contain my excitement.” He said, somewhat apologetically. 

I told him that it’s all good and wished him a good night.

The next day came by. I headed over to Bart’s house that was just down the street shortly after waking up.

Bart had sent me a message after my call with him the prior night about Surreal Corp sending him the special VR helmets that are required to run VirtualisXVR through the mail and that my personal headset wouldn’t be needed.

I knocked on his door and he instantly opened it as if he was waiting there all along for god knows how long. 

“What’s up? Are you ready to experience greatness?” Bart said while fist bumping me.

I could tell that he was really trying to act casual and not let his apparent excitement take over. 

“Sure, let's check out this supposed greatness.” I said, somewhat sarcastically.

I then asked Bart to catch me up on what exactly VirtualisXVR is and how it works as we both walked to his room. Bart gave me a brief rundown on the technology it uses and what the experience is like.

“So, basically, imagine going anywhere you want in the world and actually feeling as if you’re there. Apparently most of your five senses are able to be used and you’ll be able to see what anyone that’s actually there in person could see, but I find that hard to believe and that won’t change until I see it for myself.

To others in real life, you appear as a hologram with your face being very accurately portrayed. The rest of your body isn’t accurate to your own, but can be customized. I honestly have no idea how Surreal Corp supposedly accomplished this, and neither do tech experts. Fucking black magic, I tell ya.” Bart said while clearly being mystified and roused. He also described the two modes that are available to play, but more on that later.

His inability to accurately tell me how VirtualisXVR is even able to feasibly function left me surprised given Bart’s extensive knowledge in technology.

“You’re telling me that we’re about to try something that even experts in the field have no clue on how its even remotely exists?”

“Pretty much, yeah. Anyways, you ready?” Bart said while eyeing the VR Helmets.

“I think so. I don’t think I've ever seen you look so pumped before and I'd be lying if I said that it wasn’t rubbing off on me.”

Bart and I then began to connect the VR helmets and gloves onto his computer and then logged on to Surreal Corp’s website that’s required for VirtualisXVR to run properly. 

It was at this point that Bart started to quote Battlestar Galactica, his favorite show, something that he does from time to time to my annoyance.

“I saw a star explode and send out the building blocks of the universe. Other stars, other planets and eventually other life. A supernova! Creation itself! I was there, I wanted to see it and be part of the moment. And you know how I perceived one of the most glorious events in the universe? With these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull! With eyes designed–” 

I half-heartedly punched him in the arm before he could finish the rest of the quote. 

“Y’know, shit like that is why you’re still single.”

“You’re being a real Lamar Davis from GTA 5 right now. Next thing you know, you’re going to tell me to get rid of my yee yee ass haircut and get some bitches on my dick.”

Bart said while pointing at his bowl cut. Bartholomew’s tendency to make jokes at his own expense was something that I found endearing and almost always made me laugh, even though I sometimes felt as if he would go too far in putting himself down.

We both laughed off what he said and put the VR equipment on. I remember the helmet feeling pretty tight and causing an odd pressure on my brain that wasn’t exactly painful, but gave me an ever present feeling of uncomfortableness.

 Bart clicked on the connect option on Surreal Corp’s website which caused us to instantly be transported to an empty white room that seemed to go on forever in each direction.

The only thing of note was a large mainframe in front of me with a strange looking monitor mounted on it.

I knelt down to touch the floor and was surprised at what I experienced. I could actually feel as if I were touching the floor with my fingertips. 

It felt and looked like marble.

Bart noticed me doing this and followed my lead. His accurately displayed holographic face was full of awe and wonder. 

“They were right.” Bart exclaimed.

“What?”

“The forums… last night, you told me to try and get some sleep and I couldn’t, so I went on the interwebs to see what others had to say about VirtualisXVR and I couldn’t believe what they were saying, but they were right. It’s as if I were actually in this marble room and could feel this cold, hard floor with my hands… It’s fucking incredible.” Bart said while kneeling down and tracing his hand along the floor.

“It really is something, and this is only the hub. Imagine what it’d be like to set foot in our neighborhood through the means of these helmets, or explore areas we’ve never been to before like Rome and its Colosseum?” 

“There is no need to imagine.” Bart said with a determined look on his face as he walked over to the mainframe.

 I watched as he set the location to our neighborhood and pondered over which difficulty option to select. From the rundown that Bart gave me earlier that day at his house about VirtualisXVR, I learned the differences between peaceful and normal.

Peaceful, much like the name implies, is a chill experience where you can freely explore any area you choose with zero time constraints or enemies to worry about.

Normal is the intended way to experience VirtualisXVR. You are meant to gather ore and valuable resources while fighting off monsters until you reach your quota. Once that quota is reached, you’re then meant to head to an extraction point and hold your ground against waves of enemies until you can escape.

Bart chose Normal mode after many seconds of staring at the screen and we were then sent to our neighborhood within the blink of an eye.

It was the same neighborhood that we both grew up in and shared many memories in, but also different. A thick fog surrounded the entire area that prevented me from clearly making out anything past ten or so feet, and the sky had a reddish apricot like tint. 

It was summertime and pretty late in the morning for there to be fog or for the sky to look as if the sun had just risen. I also noticed houses that I knew like the back of my hand, looking worn down and abandoned. 

I began to feel a bit uneasy at that point, not just at how different this once familiar place looked, but also because I got the feeling as if I were being watched. I tried to look over to Bartholomew who wasn’t by my side anymore.

Panic briefly overtook me before I noticed him standing just outside his bedroom window. 

“This is... fucking crazy.” I heard him say as I approached him. 

I got closer to see what he was talking about and stopped dead in my tracks when I saw it.

There in his room where I first put on the VR helmet was Bart and I sitting on his bed, completely still with the helmets still on our heads. *Lifeless, even*.

A cold chill ran down my spine.

“This isn’t… right.” I muttered under my breath. Before I could further express my discomfort to Bart, I suddenly felt a sharp pain on my shoulder.

I instinctively reeled forward and quickly turned around, being surprised once again in quick succession at what I saw.

Bartholomew had told me that the normal difficulty had monsters that would try their best to prevent you from taking the area's valuable resources, but I didn’t expect said monsters to look so grotesque and demonic.

The creature in front of me had dark red, scaly skin. It’s face was gaunt, there were two holes where its nose should be, and it’s eyes–It’s eyes had no pupils or irises. They were two piercing orbs that were black as coal and full of hatred. Like as if it wanted nothing more in the world than to make me suffer.

The thing’s thick, jagged horns on its head and razor sharp teeth that could seemingly cut through diamond all further coalesced into me not being able to do anything but freeze and shake in fear.

People have coined the term “flight or fight response” and it was in that moment that I realized that was complete bullshit.

The thing wound up for another wicked attack with its claws and all I could do was close my eyes in anticipation of being hurt again.

I heard the sound of an odd whirring starting up next to me, before then hearing several loud laser like projectiles piercing something wet.

I felt something warm hit my face as I opened my eyes. Blood. The creature had several crimson searing holes all throughout its body and began to slowly topple backwards.

I looked to my right and saw Bart standing there looking pretty shaken up with a wild look in his eyes and holding a strange mechanism with both hands that was emitting smoke from its barrels. That strange mechanism turned out to be a sextuple barrel laser shotgun.

“Tha-nks.” I struggled to say to Bart with a half broken, strained voice as I fell on my ass. 

Bart knelt down and looked at me with concern in his eyes. 

“If you want to, we could just press the power button on the side of our helmets and call it a day. People on the forums weren’t kiddin’ about how intense this shit could get.” Bart replied while trying to breathe in and out.

I’d be lying to myself if I said that I didn’t want to get out of there ASAP. I was scared at what else could be out there in that heavy fog, still unsettled at the unshakable feeling of being watched, and my heart was pounding in my chest at an unhealthy rate, but I could also tell how much my best friend was enjoying this.

Sure, he looked somewhat rattled by the events that had just transpired, but I saw something in his eyes that I just couldn’t ignore. Excitement and curiosity.

Sometimes friends have to sacrifice things, or do something they don’t want to do, for the sake of someone they care about, I thought to myself.

**ş̵̬̭̉̓̈́̋ã̴͋̆ͅc̶̛̯̯̙̘̙͎̯͐͛̆̈́͛̍̒r̴̛̲̰̝̼̝͕̀̎̄̈́̃͛̈i̸̼̘̻̼͔̣͛̾̂f̶̢͎̙̟̑̄̄̾̿̈͜ḯ̶̮̻̺̜͕͎̪͈̽̍͊͂̀c̴̨̨͓͓̻̩̐̉̚e̷͉̘̮̰̳͌̉͐̓̈́͗͗**

I gathered all the courage I could ever possibly muster and tried to say the coolest thing I could think of at the time. 

“Fuck that. Momma ain’t raise no bitch.” I exclaimed while sporting a dumb smirk on my face and outstretching my hand towards his direction.

Bart met my hand and helped pull me to my feet while also dawning a dumb smirk on his face. I had a feeling of where this was headed at the time just by looking at him.

“Whaddya hear, Starbuck?” Bart asked, expectedly. 

“Nothing but the rain, sir.” I replied. 

If you had told me prior to that day that I, Robert Banks, would ever complete any of Bartholomew Woodrow’s sad attempts at quoting Battlestar Galactica together, then i would’ve called you crazy and laughed in your face, but for some reason, it seemed fitting in that moment and I had no problem doing so.

I checked my shoulder where the creature had attacked me earlier and I felt nothing there. No wound, no apparent pain.

*This isn’t real, those crazy bastards at Surreal Corp are just wizards when it comes to technology and creating something that feels nearly life-like*, I said in my head, trying to reassure myself. Despite not finding a wound on my shoulder, I did feel something cold.

I pulled at it and discovered what looked to be a laser SMG attached to my shoulder wrap.

“Oooh mama.” Bart remarked at the sight of it and then made a cat call whistle. I fiddled around with it, trying to discover if it had a safety mechanism.

I couldn’t find it after a few seconds of looking for it and decided to test firing the gun against a shadow that I noticed in the fog. The recoil of the SMG and its rounds per minute were immense and caught me off guard.

If my dad hadn’t taught me how to shoot automatic firearms then the gun surely would’ve ended up pointing towards the sky and I would've completely missed the target. I quickly corrected my aim and made short work of the creature in the fog.

The SMG’s barrel was red hot and began to quickly cool off.

Being able to easily take out one of the creatures that had almost made me shit my pants just a couple of minutes ago did wonders for my confidence. 

“Well done, Rambo.” 

 “Right back at ya. The way you took charge and saved my ass earlier showed you got some real balls. They hard to carry around?” I asked, jokingly.

“Oh! You can’t even begin to imagine.” Bart said as he pretended to have a lot of trouble moving his legs forward.

We both shared a laugh. 

“Anyways, how exactly do we find the things that we’re supposed to collect to leave this place?” I asked. 

Bart pointed at my wristwatch that I hadn’t noticed before. 

“By using that.” 

It showed my rough location and occasionally pinged these four yellow circles that represented the items we were supposed to collect.

Bart and I began to collect every single item on our watches radar while kicking some demonic ass. We worked well together as a team. I would cover the demons that were too far away for his shotgun to reach, while he dealt with the ones that got too close whenever we could. 

Bart would occasionally spout one-liners spoken by Duke Nukem as we both dispatched the creatures in our path. 

“It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I'm all outta gum.” Bart said with an awful impression of Duke as I collected the final gem which was an amethyst. 

The sky suddenly began to get darker, the ground began rumbling, and the watch started to emit a loud noise. 

I looked at my watch and it showed an area not too far ahead of us that it was constantly pinging. That must be the extraction point, I thought to myself. 

We both hurried towards the extraction point as we noticed how many more of those creatures were appearing through the fog. 

“Go ahead, make my day.” Bart exclaimed as he severed a demon in half with a volley from his shotgun. 

I would have normally found Bart’s stupid quotes to be cringy, but I was having so much fun experiencing VirtualisXVR with him that I really didn’t care. 

My fear from earlier and the feeling of being watched had mostly subsided momentarily. *This moment would unfortunately be the very last time that I could say I was having fun with my best friend.*

You might see that last line and think that the demons had eventually overran us and tortured us for all eternity, but the truth is, nothing like that ended up happening. 

We made it to the extraction point and eventually cleared out every demon that reared its monstrous face that only their mother could love, that is if they even had a mother. 

There were some new ones that popped up that were more horrifying than the demons we were used to seeing by now. Some of them could fly and bombarded us with their scythes as they swooped down to attack. Others were ginormous and difficult to put down despite our advanced firepower. 

The thought of being stuck there without these weapons crept into my mind while shooting them and sent my nerves into a frenzy.

“That was exhilarating.” Said Bart while trying to calm himself down. 

“Let’s not do this again, at least not for a while. I swear I almost went into cardiac arrest at least a few times while being here.” I said while struggling to breathe. 

I definitely had fun experiencing this with Bart, but fuck, was it also just too much too handle at once. 

The sharp pain that I experienced when being hit by those things even if I knew that I wasn’t actually being hurt, their malicious gazes that sent shivers down my spine, and the unmistakable feeling of being watched, which somehow grew stronger even after supposedly dealing with all the demons; All of that made me want to get the hell out of there right then and there. 

Suddenly, our watches began to play a congratulatory jingle and next thing we knew, we were transported back to the white and empty marble room with the mainframe right in front of us. 

“So. Damn. Cool.” Bartholomew quietly muttered. 

If I had to guess, I would imagine that he was raring to go back in for another round of normal mode If I were also willing, but I got the feeling that he really respected my choice of not wanting to do so, at least so soon after. 

His love for technology must’ve been greatly outweighing anything else that he must’ve been feeling for him to not feel the same way that I felt. 

“What about peaceful mode? We could explore places we’ve never been to before without having to worry about those pesky creatures.” Bart asked. 

“Yeah, we could do that.” 

“Rome?” 

I nodded yes and watched as he hastily inputted an address of a building just outside of Rome’s colosseum onto the mainframes monitor. Only a nerd like him that has watched several movies that had to do with that famous landmark like Sparticus and Gladiator, would know and be able to recall an address close to it.

We ended up going to Rome, Paris, and the perimeter around Area 51 in Nevada. 

We weren’t able to bring any items from the real world into VirtualisXVR’s semi digital world so we assumed that it wouldn’t be possible to actually get inside the colosseum considering we had no money, but a very kind employee that was awestruck at seeing our highly realistic holographic faces let us in for free to enjoy the show. 

It was at that point that I felt that strange sensation of being watched again. 

I finally told Bart about it and he asked me what I was talking about. He was too busy admiring Surreal Corp’s technological marvel and the show taking place in front of him to notice what I thought I was seeing, I thought to myself. 

I, however, was on high alert. I swear I saw things in the corner of my eyes that made my imagination go bananas, but when I turned to look at them, nothing was there. 

*My paranoia was getting out of control.*

Bart noticed that I was having serious trouble enjoying the show. 

“Dude, you seriously have to take a chill pill. Trust me, there is nothing out there.” 

I tried to shake off that feeling of dread, but I couldn’t, no matter how hard I tried. 

We eventually got to our last destination, Tikaboo peak, the closest you can legally get to Area 51. 

*The feeling only got progressively stronger as time went on*.

It was hard to make out much from where we were at. Area 51 was still pretty far from our location and a long runway was all we could clearly see. Despite that, it was still pretty cool to have such a secretive area within our sights. 

“You reckon we could get closer without getting caught?” Bart dubiously asked. 

“Maybe, but it could be really bad if they did catch us even if we were to immediately disconnect. Our faces could give away our identities, and they could potentially contact Surreal Corp for any data on whoever visited this area using VirtualisXVR. I’d say it's not–”

*That’s when I clearly saw* ***it*** *for the first time.*

Just thirty feet behind Bart’s back, was a figure that was evil incarnate. 

It was similar in form to the creature that attacked me just outside Bart’s bedroom window, but its features were more human-like. It was widely smiling from ear to ear with its teeth very tightly clenched against each other, almost as if it were in tremendous pain. 

Its eyes told a different story. They were wide open, full of immense hatred and hunger that is simply impossible to describe through the English language. 

What separated its eyes from the previous creatures that I saw in my distorted neighborhood with Bart was the sign of intelligence. This creature wouldn’t just blindly attack me at the first opportunity it got. 

No. It would bide its time until the time was right, and that was terrifying to me. I at this point began to stumble back in fear. 

Bart noticed how scared I was and leaned forward to grab my hand to prevent me from falling. 

The last I saw of the creature out in the Nevada desert was it waving goodbye, as if saying, “Be seeing you soon.” I fainted.

From what I came to later know from Bart, he had immediately disconnected from VirtualisXVR as soon as he realized that I was unconscious and took my helmet off. I woke up in a cold sweat around three minutes later to see him calling 911. 

He looked glad to see me awake and told the dispatcher on the phone that everything was alright now before hanging up. 

“What the hell happened out there?” Bart worryingly asked. 

“I-, I sa-, I saw-” I could barely even speak. 

I took a few deep breaths and tried again. 

“You’re going to think that i’m imagining things or that i’m fucking with you, but I saw evil personified out in that desert… I’m sure it's the same thing that I told you I was seeing in the corners of my vision earlier in Rome.” 

“What?” Bart asked with a concerned expression on his face.” 

“I swear to god man, I know what I saw and that thing wants nothing more than to cause us some serious harm. I felt its presence all the way back from the very beginning. Something is seriously fucking wrong with this shit.” I said as I pointed towards the VR equipment. 

“No. That can’t be right, we were in peaceful mode. There aren't supposed to be any enemies.” Bart said as he sat on his office chair and began typing on his keyboard. 

“Think about it, Bart. Isn’t it awfully odd how even you of all people don’t know how VirtualisXVR is even able to exist? This tech is out of this world… unnatural, and I have a sinking feeling that terrible things are going to happen to us if we were to go back… It shouldn’t exist!” 

Bart didn’t answer for several long seconds as he stared at his monitor. 

“Come check this out.” He said as he pointed towards something on his monitor. It was the forum that he had mentioned in the past where people discussed anything to do with VirtualisXVR. 

A handful of users in the thread were recounting experiences similar to what I went through which then preceded a message by a supposed lead developer named Adrian Faustus that worked on the project.

“We apologize for any distress that we may have caused to our dear users that encountered unexpected entities within our Peaceful mode. We can assure you all that we are working very diligently to resolve this issue. Any entity that you might encounter within our Peaceful mode is merely a visual bug and you have no reason to worry. We appreciate you all for bringing this issue to our attention and we sincerely hope that you continue to enjoy VirtualisXVR.”

“See? It’s only a visual bug. There’s nothing to worry about.” I sat back on his bed after reading the messages. Bart looked expectantly at me, waiting for what I had to say. 

*I did not know what to believe anymore. Was it really just a bug? It sure didn’t feel like it*, I thought to myself. 

“I don’t know anymore to be completely honest, man. But, If you saw what I saw out there in that desert with these ridiculous gelatinous orbs in my skull… then I think you’d understand.” 

I quoted something he said earlier that day that was from Battlestar Galactica to try to get my point across. I also briefly described what the thing I saw in the desert looked like. 

“And it's not even just what I saw, but what I felt. I felt that thing’s presence watching us from the moment we set foot in our neighborhood. It felt incredibly invasive and that feeling only got stronger the longer we spent there.” Bart took some time to process my words, but still looked somewhat unconvinced.  

“Could a mere visual bug really make someone feel that way, or even make someone faint from fear?” I asked him.

“I don’t doubt what you saw or what you felt, but I do know that Surreal Corp identified what you saw as a bug and I have no reason to think that they’re lying. You’re my best friend and if you never want to try VirtualisXVR ever again because of this experience that clearly terrified you, then I'll respect that, but I really think that you should give it at least one more try once they fix the bug. 

I promise that if you experience something like this again while having that helmet on, that we’ll immediately disconnect and that I'll never bring VirtualisXVR up to you ever again or nag you to play it.” 

I understood where Bart was coming from. He’s a person whose mind operates on logic over emotions and feelings, and from his point of view, it made sense for him to doubt that anything was seriously wrong. Especially after seeing Surreal Corp claim that what I saw was a harmless bug. 

His proposition also seemed fair as well–If I saw or felt anything that unsettled me again, then we could just disconnect, *right*?

I began to seriously consider whether or not to take him up on his offer on trying VirtualisXVR again once that bug was fixed, but before I could come to a decision, I suddenly remembered that I had a date two hours from then with my girlfriend, Wilfrida. 

“Listen, I kinda forgot that I have a date with Frida’ pretty soon so I gotta go… but I promise that I'll think about what you said.” I said while getting up from his bed and making my way out his bedroom door. 

“Sure, sounds good man. Take it easy.” I told him to take it easy as well and left his house. After leaving his house, I noticed that l strangely felt pretty exhausted. Both physically and mentally. 

I luckily had around an hour and thirty minutes to take a nap before my date.
