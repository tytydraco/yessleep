This is a true story of me, and my friend, and our experience with this cemetery.

Me and my friend, who I will call Ben, commonly stayed weekends at my house. One of our favorite activities was walking through the miles of back roads my home is located on. 

While we were walking down one of these roads, bored out of our minds, we see a a green road sign to the left, it reads "Ravenhill Cemetery Rd" due to us being idiots and bored, we explore.
The road takes you to a small clearing, off the the right is the actual cemetery. Its a small, family cemetery with a metal fence caging it all in. Though the most interesting part is the road continues on into the tree line, with a chain link rope blocking the path that says "No trespassing" however that did not stop us.

As we walk through, even though we didn't notice yet, it got eerily quiet. The wind died, bugs ceased to make their presence known, and the tree canopy almost enveloped the sky.

One of the most odd things is, theres tires EVERYWHERE. Hundreds of tires for tractors, cars, trucks, etc. the  most unbelievable part of this story is a little ways off you can see a tree, with a baby doll hanging from a tree branch, a rope tied around its neck. Under the baby doll was a dead, mutilated dog. The way it was, it looked like the dog had its inside ripped out right there. The worst part?

It was fresh.

At this point I reluctantly agree to leave with my friend, having been creeped the hell out.

About a month later, my friend is at my house again, and we think back about this place, that we have now named Tire Cemetery. We both decided that, it was a coincidence, and we were stupid to be scared of such a place, and that we were going to go back to get back at those dead people, and continue on the path past Tire Cemetery. We'd joke about peeing on the tires, taking some home even.

I think, somewhere deep inside both of us, we wanted to prove to ourselves that this experience was nothing more than our imagination, that there was never any danger.

We make the walk back to the cemetery, joking along the way, as we crest the top of the road. We see it.

 something was in the middle of the road.

We get a little closer, trying to adjust our eyes. It's a dog, with an empty food bowl, and it's been staring at us since we entered sight. It's a large, muscular dog, with orange eyes that pierced fear into you. I believe the breed to have been a Cane Corso/pitbull, as big as a Cane Corso, with the looks of a pitbull.
As we got closer, the air got thicker. The dog had this aura around him, that conveyed a very clear message;
"Leave or else."
The dog never flinched, barked, and never sat up from its position. The only movement he made was his head, it followed us.

We walked past, both of us could feel the message in the air, despite the dog being calm.
As we walked past it continued to stare at us until we left sight again.

Why is there a food bowl there? Why is the dog there? The cemetery is Miles from any home, so who just has a food bowl, and why in the middle of a road?

As we walk back, we still want to prove to ourselves this is all crap, all stupid coincidence that piles up. 

If the dogs gone, we're going in. If he's there, we are going to go around him, cut through the tree line and go around the dog.

Once we are in sight again, the dogs still there, as if he never stopped looking at us. We walk past him, the air still conveying the gut wrenching, dreadful message of you are not welcome here. We just enter the tree line, ready to get around this stupid dog.

When Ben says my name

"What is it, ben?"

"The song that's playing on my phone... I've never heard this before"

"So what?"

The song that was playing was 'Walk' by Pantera.

If you've never heard it, listen to the it, you'll understand why that specific song is the last song we'd want to somehow play on Spotify, that was not in his playlist.

Becoming painfully aware none of this is coincidence, I look once more at the dog, it has now sat up from its position, and its orange eyes pierce into me.

We both leave the forest and run home, and we've never returned since.

As I said this is a true story, if I learned anything from it, I learned to take warnings when I see one.
