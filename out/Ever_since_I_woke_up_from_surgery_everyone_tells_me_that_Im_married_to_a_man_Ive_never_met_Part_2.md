[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12wgxop/ever_since_i_woke_up_from_surgery_everyone_tells/)

I spent the first few weeks in the hospital in a state of resignation. I said little and occupied my many bedridden hours staring emptily at the tile ceiling.

My head ached, my ribs were sore, and my legs were barely responsive. But when I cried, it wasn’t because of the physical pain. Every cautious, careful decision I’d made had been for nothing. I felt checkmated, with no way out and nowhere to hide.

“There, there,” Brandon would say while he gently patted my wet cheek with a tissue. “You’ve been through so much. I’ll always be here for you, and we’ll make it through this, together, I promise.”

I wanted to scream for help, to beg the nurses to keep him away from me. But that hadn’t worked before, and that certainly wouldn’t work now that the law recognized me as the guardian of a small child.

While my body bore no signs of it, all the documentation necessary to establish that I’d given birth to Martin was in perfect order. There were hospital bills, preschool records, updates to insurance policies. His birth certificate displayed November 7, 2018. “Nine months after Valentine’s Day,” said Brandon, with a sickly smile that made me want to punch him in the face.

Of course, I had no memories of the boy I’d supposedly brought into this world, who appeared with me and Brandon in dozens upon dozens of pictures and videos.

I wondered what lay behind Martin’s hazel eyes. Had Brandon somehow conjured up a real, living being? If so, was he human, the same thing as Brandon (a ‘cambion,’ as Jean had called him), or something in between? Or, was Martin a mere figment – the latest cruel illusion cast by my perpetual tormenter?

I decided to play along. Based on what Jean had told me, Brandon wouldn’t need me anymore if he realized that I knew the truth. The first time I’d undergone an operation, as the story went, I’d lost all memory of my loving husband as a fluke side effect. The second time, I’d lost all memory of my precious son. After all, that’s what the brainwashed doctors are telling me, and that’s what someone who believed Brandon’s lies would think.

So, I stayed in character as best as I could. I repeated to Brandon that I loved him, and that I accepted him as my husband, even as I still had no memories of him. I confessed that I had no memories now of Martin, either, but that I trusted Brandon and believed him when he told me that Martin was my son.

“Mommy is sick,” Brandon had explained in front of me to a wide-eyed Martin. “Because she’s sick, she sometimes has trouble remembering things. But she still loves you. Isn’t that right, April?”

Martin turned to me. “Yes,” I croaked, “that’s right, Martin. I’m sick, and I’m having some trouble remembering things, but I still love you.”

“When will you get better?” asked Martin, his brow furrowed with concern.

“She will soon, Martin,” assured Brandon. “Soon. And we’ll do everything we can to support her.”

My parents were less sympathetic. “You’re lucky that you married Brandon,” chided my mother when she visited me. “A lot of men wouldn’t still be so supportive after what you’ve put him through.”

I didn’t bother arguing.

\~

I couldn’t let Brandon know what I’d learned from Jean. Of course, I had no real evidence of my relationship with Emma, but it *felt* true in a way that my supposed marriage to Brandon never had. I could only remember glimpsing her twice, but the image of her wiry frame, round face and curly blonde hair had stuck with me. I prayed that maybe, just maybe, she’d figure out a way to rescue me from the hell that my life had become.

Naturally, Brandon was eager to learn just what Jean had told me. In my version of events, I climbed into the van expecting another ride to the dealership, only to be whisked away from town against my will. “I begged him to stop and let me out, but he wouldn’t say anything. He was driving like a madman, Brandon. I’m not surprised somebody hit us. I think he was crazy.”

“He didn’t tell you anything at all about what he wanted, or where he was taking you?” asked Brandon.

When I shook my head, I sensed his skepticism. He had reason to worry. If he got his power from convincing his victims of lies, then how long did I have before he realized that his were no longer fooling me?

Hopefully a little while longer – long enough to flee, or to come up with some plan to fight back. I figured that, if I were to stay alive, I needed to gain some advantage over him.

Even as the weeks of recovery, including regular sessions of intense physical therapy, helped me slowly regain control over my body, I feigned being unable to walk more than a few steps. I knew this act – something the doctors ascribed to a ‘mental block’ – could only last so long.

But, at least, it gave me a brief leg up over Brandon – a window during which he believed my movements were more restricted than they really were and, hopefully, would monitor me less closely. I used those nights to sneak out of my bed and explore the hospital, taking care to move quietly and evade the staff whose routes I steadily learned.

When I overheard two nurses chatting that the man found with me in the crash had finally woken up, I knew I had only a short time to act. That night, I forced my weakened body down a flight of stairs and across several corridors until I arrived at my destination in the intensive care unit. I slipped inside the room, closing the door quietly behind me.

Jean was in a neck brace, and bruises covered much of his face. “I’m so sorry,” I told him. “I’m only a stranger to you, and all this happened to you just because you wanted to help me.”

“April…I’m so glad you’re still alive.” He spoke softly in a weak, whimpering voice.

“I told him that you didn’t say a word to me in the van. You need to say the same thing if-”

“I understand.”

I asked him the question that had been bothering me ever since I awoke at the hospital. “Jean, I need to know why he’s keeping me around. You said Grousel gets his power from fooling people. But I *know* it’s all an act now. So, what’s in it for him?”

“He invested heavily in you…” Jean stopped to catch his breath before continuing. “He won’t give up until he knows that you’re…that you’re a lost cause. He may wait until he has another target. Play along…convince him that you believe him…that will buy you some time.” 

“I need to know how to kill him. Can he be shot, or stabbed?”

“No…you’d only be harming a mirage…”

“What if I destroy his book?”

“That would undo some of his spells. But, he can simply create a new book and cast them again.”

“Then *what do I do*?” I pleaded.

Jean’s response made little sense to me. “To defeat Grousel…shatter the illusions that give him his power. Only then will he be vulnerable. I left an athame with Emma that might-”

“I don’t understand. How-”

Jean motioned for me to be silent, then gestured to the door behind me. I gasped when I realized its handle was slowly turning. “Hide,” whispered Jean.

I scurried towards the closet at the far end of the room. From inside, I could still observe my surroundings through a narrow slit in the center of the closed bifold doors.

The door to Jean’s room opened slowly as a small figure materialized from the shadows of the dimly lit hallway. It was…*Martin*?

Martin spoke in the same nauseatingly high-pitched voice I’d grown to loathe over the last few weeks. “Excuse me, sir. I don’t feel very good.”

“Child…you must be lost,” responded Jean.

“No, I don’t think so,” said Martin, as he slowly approached Jean. 

“Who are you, child?”

“I’m no child. I’m a copy, an extension of an entity hundreds of years old.” Abruptly, Martin hopped onto the bed and positioned himself over Jean.

“What are you *doing*?” asked a perplexed Jean.

Ignoring him, Martin lowered his head until it was mere inches above Jean’s. “I told you I was sick. My head doesn’t feel right. Especially when I do this.”

Martin placed his hands behind his ears. Suddenly, he pressed, hard, until his hands penetrated and burrowed into his skin, leaving only his wrists exposed.

Jean’s expression shifted from bewilderment to horror as Martin continued to dig into his own head, twisting his hands around his scalp as he did so. Martin showed no sign of pain even as blood oozed out of the increasingly long gash and showered onto Jean. When Brandon’s hands finally emerged from his forehead, they held onto Martin’s face, which disconnected from the rest of his head.

Jean yelled expletives as he hit the nurse call button.

“*That won’t do you any good*.” The voice that resounded from Martin sounded nothing like it had before. It was deep, but with a wispy echo that caused every word to reverberate with an unnatural energy. “*They won’t be coming to help you. I’ve disabled everything in here.*”

Martin’s form changed. His skin liquified and melted into a thin layer of bloody residue, exposing underneath it a body made of murky green scales. Horns grew from the forehead of his new, angular face. A set of pink wings burst through his shirt. His fingers stretched and curved as they transformed into long, sharp claws. Meanwhile, the flesh they held – which had once been the face of the child claiming to be my own – solidified into a circular wooden oval. 

“*What*…*what are you?*” asked a panicked Jean.

“You haven’t figured it out yet?” sneered Martin. “The boy you saw was just an illusion, a veneer. A boring role I’ve spent the last few months playing.”

Indeed, I realized that the object he was holding was now an exceedingly plain mask, its only notable features being a minor indentation for a nose and three nondescript holes for eyes and a mouth.

Jean looked at him wide-eyed. “Grousel…he made another one…”

Martin laughed. “Not many know our name. It took decades to harness the energy necessary for fission. The sucker upstairs telling me that she *loved* me – the other me, that is – was the finishing touch. But the real question is: does she know? I’ll find out soon enough. But you could save me the trouble.”

“I don’t…I don’t know what you’re talking about,” whimpered Jean.

Martin extended a claw against Jean’s shoulder. “I can carve you up, bit by bit, until you tell me.” He moved his claw down Jean’s arm. “Is that what you want?” His claw stopped when it reached Jean’s wrist. “Now what is this?”

Martin’s claw had grasped a metal bracelet. Its chain appeared to be made of silver, and it featured a small amethyst stone in its center.

“It’s…nothing. They gave it back to me with my other personals when I awoke.”

“Oh, it’s no ordinary bracelet,” said Martin. “You put some work into charming its jewel to protect against our influence. Clever, but it’s of no value anymore.” With swift motion, Martin’s claw ripped through the bracelet, causing it to snap and its parts to scatter across the floor. “Now, tell me: what did you say to April?”

Jean took a deep breath before replying. “I had everything set up at a motel…Pictures, books, charts…I was going to explain it all to her when we got there. When…when we crashed…I hadn’t told her anything at all yet. She probably thinks I’m just…just some crazy person.”

Martin glanced down for a moment, then back at Jean. A satisfied smile spread across his face as he hopped to the ground. “I believe you,” he said. He held out the palm of his left hand, which he proceeded to dig into with his right claw until drops of emerald green bled out from it. “But, you’re still too much trouble to keep around.”

Martin walked around Jean, using his hand to let drops of blood fall against the floor and the hospital bed until it formed a liquid outline that surrounded Jean.

“Don’t do this!” pleaded Jean.

Martin ignored him, instead stepping backwards and closing his eyes. He began to chant in a language that sounded to me like Latin. As the volume and tempo of his words gradually increased, the drops of blood on the floor started to simmer until, finally, they burst into green flames that stretched up halfway to the ceiling.

“Please!” yelled Jean. But it was too late. At once, the ring of fire expanded rapidly inwards, engulfing Jean. In an instant, Jean’s body disintegrated, leaving behind only bits of charred, brittle bone, and the flames disappeared moments later.

It took all the strength I had to resist yelling out or bolting for the exit. I closed my eyes as a wave of shock ran through me. I’d just witnessed the murder of an innocent man, at the hands of the very being I’d been pretending was my son. Gone, too, was my best hope for ever defeating Brandon.

When I opened my eyes, Martin was holding a flimsy, heavily burnt bit of Jean’s bone. Martin tightened his claws around it, crumpling it into a gray powder that he scooped into a plastic bag.

Martin lifted the wooden mask and pressed it against his face. Over the next few seconds, his human body reformed around him, such that he once more resembled the small child who’d regularly visited me at the hospital, albeit with long tears on the back of his shirt that marked the spots out of which his wings had sprouted. Bag in hand, Martin crept away into the gloomy corridor outside.

\~

By the time my physical state had improved enough for the hospital to discharge me, my emotional state had hit rock-bottom. I had no idea how to defeat Brandon. *Shatter the illusions that give him his power*, Jean had said. But how the hell could I do that?

The only thing I could think of was to run. “Planning our next vacation?” Brandon had asked me the morning after I’d stayed up searching flights and bus routes on my phone.

“What? No,” I’d responded, flustered.

He shrugged as he continued preparing breakfast for the three of us. “Good. It’s important that you rest and stay put until you’re fully recovered.”

The incident left me frustrated with myself. *Of course* Brandon had a way of monitoring my phone. I should have anticipated that.

In time, my health had improved to the point that I could leave the house for short errands or to take myself to therapy. But no matter where I went, I always assumed that Brandon was watching and listening. I lived my life as if under constant surveillance.

I still kept up the act of being in worse shape than I was. Stairs, in particular, I pretended to need extensive help with. Brandon happily obliged, holding me lovingly around the waist and shoulder as he helped me climb up to our bedroom every night.

I spent my days caring for a monster I pretended to love. Having no actual prior experience with childcare, I had to learn fast. Martin cried, threw fits, and generally left me exhausted. Nonetheless, I tried to treat him affectionately as I dressed him, worked with him on potty training, and read to him. 

Once, while picking up his stuffed animals, I felt a small, solid object on the inside of a purple rabbit he liked to hold while he slept. “Give me Mr. Boots!” commanded Martin, before I had a chance to investigate further. “Of course, sweetie,” I said, praying that whatever was inside of it was a choking hazard.

Throughout the long, tedious days I spent with Martin, images flashed through my mind of Martin’s true, demonic form, and Jean’s fiery death at his hands. Did the same fate await me when Brandon realized the truth?

I spent my nights with Brandon curled up around me. He would hold me tightly, and he was getting bolder and pushier about wanting to ‘resume’ intimate activities with me – activities that, according to him, *I* had usually been the one to initiate.

“I want that too, Brandon,” I would say. “But I’m still healing. I’m so sore. I don’t think I’m ready yet.”

“Okay, love,” he would reply while gripping my hand. “Take your time. Only once you’re ready.”

I rarely got much sleep.

\~

As part of my loving wife and mother act, I’d insisted on giving Brandon a break by taking Martin to a preschool friend’s birthday party at a neighbor’s house. After an hour, the noise of the many screeching children ignited a raging headache in me. It didn’t help that another mother kept talking my ear off despite my many attempts to evade her. 

“I hear you’re forgetten’ things again?” she screeched. “Personally, I don’t get it. Nothing could ever make me forget about my Samantha. She’s the most important thing in the world to me!”

“Excuse me,” I said as I hobbled towards the quiet front porch.

From outside, I looked in through the glass. Among the children stood a figure I hadn’t noticed before: a costumed character in the form of a black cat. The costume reminded me of a sports team mascot, if a bit shorter, and it dragged a prop tail behind it as it waddled through the room to the delight of the kids around it.

As the kids thronged around a box labeled “party favors” that it placed in the room’s center, the cat turned towards me. Fear instincts kicked in as it locked its large, nightmarishly red eyes onto me and proceeded to move in my direction.

I backed up until I hit the porch railing. Meanwhile, the costumed figure kept on coming. Fumbling awkwardly against the handle, it opened the front door and continued approaching me. 

My heart throbbed as the cat slowly extended a long, furry arm towards me. To my relief, it merely placed a small goodie bag at my feet before returning silently to the party.

Still flustered by the situation, I reached inside the bag, finding a small disposable camera and a handwritten note containing the following text:

*“April – there is a way out of this. But, you need to follow these precise instructions.*

*First, don’t tell anyone about this note. Keep it hidden. Or, better yet, burn it.*

*Second, take pictures of the pages within Brandon’s book. The more recent and legible they are, the better. Use the camera here, and leave it in the bush beneath your bedroom window tomorrow night.*

*Third, agree to host a substitute dinner at the original time. Stay alive until then, and when the time comes,* ***tell the truth****.*”

Holy shit, I thought as I stuffed the note and camera back into the bag. Someone *was* trying to help me. That’s what this had to mean, right?

I recalled how Jean had spent weeks getting himself a job at the dealership just to have a chance to talk to me without Brandon noticing anything out of the ordinary. Had Mae, Emma, or someone else gone to the trouble of getting an entertainer gig at this party just to have a moment to communicate with me?

Before I had a chance to act, Martin ran up to me excitedly. “My bag had gummies and tattoos!” he exclaimed. “What’s in yours?”

“Um, the – the same. The same.”

\~

The party ended soon after, and I didn’t see the costumed figure again. 

The words from the note ran through my mind as I drove Martin home. I had no better idea than to follow its instructions, but locating Brandon’s book – and the key I would need to unlock it – would be no easy task. And what ‘dinner’ did I need to survive until, and what “truth” did I need to confess?

I didn’t have to wait long for a few answers. It was around eight at night, just after I’d tucked Martin into bed, when the doorbell rang. To my delight, I opened it to find my friends Mae and Olivia, who said they were there to check in on me.

I played it cool. Naturally, I wondered if they remained under Brandon’s control, or if they were there to help me. Had one of them been in the costume?

Olivia announced that she had major news, revealing a rose gold ring with a deep purple diamond around her finger. 

“I had no idea!” I exclaimed, a little hurt that I hadn’t even known Olivia was seeing anyone seriously.

“Don’t worry,” said Mae, sensing my reaction. “*I* barely knew about it, and I’m her housemate.”

Brandon and I congratulated Olivia, and I expressed that I couldn’t wait to meet her partner.

“We’ve been planning a small engagement dinner later this month, and we were about to invite you all to it,” explained Olivia. “But, the restaurant just canceled. Seems like they’re going out of business. So, it looks like we’re back at square one.”

“I’m sorry to hear that,” said Brandon. “But I’m sure you can find another spot.”

“No – um, don’t do that.” I said, prompting quizzical looks from the others. “We, uh – we’ll host it here, if that’s okay with you. We’d love to do that, actually. Right, Brandon?”

Brandon gave me a quick, surprised glance. “Um, yeah, yeah, of course. We can have you over, if that’s alright with you two.”

“Really?” asked Olivia. “You don’t have to do that for us. We don’t want to burden you. Really, it’s no problem for us to just find a new venue, and-”

“I think it’s a great idea,” said Mae, turning to Olivia. “As long as it’s okay with you, I’m onboard.”

“Okay, okay,” said Olivia, growing a little red as she thanked me and Brandon.

Before leaving, Mae gave me a quick, friendly hug. As she did so, I noticed that she wore a necklace that was tucked into her shirt. At its center was a tear-shaped amethyst jewel.

\~

The next morning, I relayed that I still had a headache from the previous night, and Brandon agreed to drop Martin off at preschool on his way to work. I began rummaging through the house as soon as they pulled out of the driveway.

The key was easy enough to find. Slipping my fingers through a tiny incision in Mr. Boots’ belly, I pulled it out without noticeably damaging Martin’s favorite toy. The more challenging task was locating the book.

I’d found it once stuffed deep within the cushion of the basement sofa. But, now, Brandon had hidden it somewhere else – presumably, someplace where I wouldn’t stumble across it.

I looked everywhere I could think of – behind every book, in every piece of furniture, every closet, and every drawer. Checking the clock, I realized hardly an hour remained before Brandon brought Martin home.

*Think April, think.* Where would Brandon expect me to never go?

I glanced up at the retractable staircase that led to the attic. Not only would I need a stepping stool to reach it, but I’d then have to climb its rickety steps – something I’d convinced Brandon I was incapable of doing.

It still wasn’t easy. My body struggled to make the ascent, and an aching pain ran through me when I finally set my feet down on the dusty wooden floor.

The attic was hot and musty. A single box sat nearby. It was filled with rags, dirty towels, and, beneath them all, the same book I’d found months earlier. The key fit right in.

\~

I turned its brittle, antiquated pages carefully. Tiny, handwritten scribbles covered each one of them so densely that the paper itself was barely visible underneath.

The words appeared to be of varying languages. At first, they appeared old, ancient, even, but I started to vaguely recognize them around the halfway point: something loosely Slavic, then German, then French.

I noticed patterns, too, in the layout. A new section would begin with a name – usually, but not always, a feminine one. Towards the end, as the writing appeared in Spanish, I saw names like *Josefa*, *Dolores*, and *Ángel*.

As the writing transitioned into English over the last few pages, I came across sections labeled *Allison*, *Deborah*, *Naomi*. I paused to read one, labeled *Beatrice*, in detail.

The first few pages were filled with detailed notes about her daily routine, friends, family, health, likes, dislikes, phobias, fantasies, and sexual history. “Intelligent, skeptical, slow to trust. Valuable target. High likelihood of initial rejection. Persuasion will require endorsements not just from friends & family but also her counselor and doctors.” Using the camera from the gift bag, I snapped pictures of the next several pages, which listed what appeared to be steps and ingredients for various incantations.

I took pictures, too, of the next few sections, which contained similar information related to a wealthy, elderly man named Garret; a middle-aged theatre performer named Erika; and a young woman studying biology named Kathleen. In each case, the notes revealed the extraordinary amount of work Brandon had done studying his targets, followed by the elaborate spells he had used to support his gaslighting routine.

Finally, I reached the section titled *April*. Bracing myself for the discomfort that would follow, I skimmed Brandon’s summaries of my background, which mostly consisted of mundane details about my education, career, health, hobbies, and interests. Every place – over weeks – that I’d visited, and how I’d gotten there. A paragraph about my relationship with Emma described us as deeply in love. It ended: “*Parents remain unsupportive/ashamed - will be easy to sway.*”

The final section read differently from the rest. His cursive was sloppier and less methodical than before.

*Does she know? Does she know? Does she know?*

*Still won’t put out.*

*Little nourishment. Less energy than before. He must have told her.*

*His story matches hers. But…*

*Does she know?*

*Still unwilling in bed. Should have caved by now*

*Does she know?*

*Does she know?*

*Time to move on?*

I wiped my wet my forehead before I turning to the last page. The name at the top read *Margaret*.

*Oh shit*, I thought, as a horrifying feeling settled upon me. The details that followed, which appeared incomplete, were of *Mae*’s life, from every place she’d ever lived to her family, mental health issues, various eccentric hobbies, friendship with Olivia, past boyfriends, and present relationship with Casey.

*If I don’t stop him*, I realized, *she’ll be next*.

A sound from several stories below me broke the silence. *Fuck*, I thought, slamming the book shut and relocking it as I realized that Brandon and Martin had just opened the front door. Frantically, I placed it back where I found it and rushed as best I could towards the retractable staircase.

\~

I’d just returned the key to Martin’s stuffed animal when they made it upstairs. “Hey Brandon, I was just tidying Martin’s room up a bit.”

Brandon eyed me suspiciously as Martin took Mr. Boots from my hand. “Everything okay?”

“Yeah, yeah I’m fine.” I realized I was caked in sweat. “I, uh, was trying to clean a bit, and I went up and down the stairs my own. I shouldn’t have. It was tough, and I barely made it.”

“Oh, honey,” said Brandon as he gently embraced me. “I know you want to help out, but you need to take care of yourself.”

\~

Late that evening, Brandon led me down to the kitchen to try a dish he was preparing, explaining that he might serve it at the engagement dinner if it turned out well.

I sat at the kitchen table as he sliced several tomatoes. “Funny thing,” he said as he cooked. “When I got home today, I noticed that the attic door was partially open.”

I felt my face grow pale. “Oh, really? I didn’t notice that.”

“Yep. It was almost shut. But not quite. I’m sure I didn’t leave it that way. It got me thinking.”

“Thinking about what?”

“About…” Brandon stopped talking for a moment as he chopped up a cucumber in a series of rapid, precise movements. “About who would have gone up there. It wasn’t me. Martin can’t reach that high. So that leaves you.”

“Brandon, don’t be silly.” I forced a smile. “I have no reason to go up there. And even if I wanted to, I can barely-”

“You can barely go up steps on your own, right. Anyway, food’s ready.” He placed a plate of the salad he’d been working on before me. “Don’t start yet, though. There’s one more ingredient I still need to add. A French seasoning I got a sample of at the farmer’s market last weekend.“

He removed from a cabinet a small plastic bag containing a gray powder. As Brandon brought it closer to me, I slowly recalled where I’d seen it before.

“Just a few pinches of this,” said Brandon as he spread it over my plate, “and it’s ready. Please, try it.”

“I…I’m not sure if I’m still hungry.”

“*Try it*,” insisted Brandon. There was a fire in the back of his green eyes.

I wanted so badly to smash the plate on the floor and use a kitchen knife to cut Brandon’s throat. But, instead, I closed my eyes. *Just a little bit longer*, I repeated to myself, remembering the note. *This is a test. I can pass it. I didn’t survive this long to fail now*.

I opened my eyes again. “Okay. I’ll try it.” My shaking hand gripped my fork as I scooped several pieces of lettuce, covered in a thin layer of bone dust, into my mouth. I chewed, swallowed, and took another bite. “It’s good. Really good Brandon. Thank you.”

He made me finish it. When my plate was empty, I announced I was going to bed. “Sure, I’ll help you up,” said Brandon. As we approached the staircase, I realized I was feeling nauseous. The knots in my stomach only grew tighter when Brandon held me around my waist and shoulder and pushed his body against mine.

*I can do this*, I repeated to myself. As we slowly ascended, I tried as hard as I could to ignore the dizziness that was setting upon me. But I couldn’t help but recall Jean’s fiery death at Martin’s hands, and the way Martin had crumbled up his brittle bones….*Oh God*, what had I done?

Before I knew it, I was on my knees, projectile vomiting half-digested bits of croutons, lettuce, and Jean all over the carpeted steps.

\~

Brandon left me alone after I convinced him that my stomach had settled. With Martin asleep, I took the opportunity to comply with another of the note’s instructions by dropping the camera out the bedroom window into the bush below.

As I settled into bed, I recalled the words at the start of the note: “April – *there is a way out of this.”* I tried to focus on the hope those words represented and suppress the questions that swam through mind: who wrote it, who would (presumably) be coming to retrieve the camera, why they needed the photos I’d taken, and if their plan – which very much seemed set to occur at the dinner party – would actually work.

I wondered, too, if I’d even survive long enough for it to matter. I’d given Brandon every reason to be suspicious, and from the looks of it, he was already gathering information about his next victim.

After plenty of tossing and turning, I managed to drift off to sleep. In my dream, Brandon was gone, and Emma and I were vacationing together in a secluded cabin. I asked Emma what had happened to Brandon, and she smiled and told me that I didn’t need to worry about him anymore.

A sense of relief swept through me. I felt happier than I’d been since before I went in for the operation so many months ago, but when I rested my head against Emma’s shoulder, I saw a pair of wings sprout from her back. I stepped back as her face fell off, forming into a mask as it hit the floor. Emma appeared before me now in the diabolical form I’d seen Martin transform into at the hospital.

“No,” I cried. “It can’t be. Not you, too.”

“You really thought you could escape me?” he taunted as he leapt toward me.

I awoke in a sweat. I was on my stomach, and I noticed the bedsheet near me absorb a drop of liquid with a greenish tint. Another drop followed, then another. I froze.

I heard whispers. It was Brandon’s voice. He sounded like he was standing next to me. He was *chanting*, and it was the same fucking chant Martin had repeated before igniting Jean.

So this was it. Brandon was done with me. He knew I’d been in the attic looking for his book. He knew that I knew the real ingredient he’d added to the salad. He knew that I was no use to him any longer.

If I tried to run, he’d catch me. If I tried to fight him, he’d win. If I tried nothing, I’d burn.

Brandon’s chanting grew faster, louder. *Fuck*. *What do I do?*

I thought about what I’d read in Brandon’s book, his recent advances, and his comment about Valentine’s Day. What if I…No, no. *That* was a price I’d rather die than pay.

But there was one idea worth trying – something that could keep me alive long enough to have a chance at escape. After all, if whatever was set to transpire at the dinner party didn’t work, I was as good as dead anyway.

“Brandon, is that you?” I used as innocuous a voice as I could muster. As I spoke, I kept my head buried in my pillow. I didn’t want him to think I’d seen anything. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to tell you. Something important.” 

The chanting ceased. “Sorry if I woke you, April,” said Brandon. “I was just talking to myself. What is it?”

“I think it’s about time for us to restart a few things.”

“What do you mean, honey?”

“I *want* you, Brandon. I want us to *fuck* like we used to. You have no idea how much I want you inside of me, Brandon.”

“Oh.” I sensed Brandon’s approach. He nuzzled his head against mine and whispered into my ear. “Are you *sure* you’re ready for that, honey? I don’t want to rush you.”

“This dinner we’re hosting…it’ll be a big event for all of us, as a family. I’ve been thinking: after that, after the guests have left and we’ve put Martin to bed, that can be our first time since…since…all this happened. Starting then, I want it to be like old times. I want you to show me all the things we did together.”

Brandon gave me a light kiss on the back of my head. “You have no idea how much that means to me.”

Weeks have passed since then. The party is set to occur in several hours. In the interim, Brandon’s last words from that terrible evening have echoed in my mind: “I promise you, April, it will be a night to [remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeaceSim/).”
