So I'm trying to figure out what I can do. I was staying at a little cabin a few miles away from Limon, Colorado and I had this lady come up to my door. It's a little weird considering the next house is 6 miles up so there is no mistaking a house. You have to try to get to my house to end up on my front porch.

She knocked like a cop. A firm shaking that engulfed the entire cabin, from the door to the back toilet seat down stairs everything rattled.I was alarmed, that seemed forceful. 

I Opened the door to a shadow. The porch light had broken a couple of days ago, I meant to fix it. Only a vague light that highlighted just her size and shape, not anything too intricate. “Is James Here?” The voice read out in almost a calm undistressed way. “No, No one by the name of James lives here. Maybe he's over at the house a few miles down. I can call him for you.” She paused and then it looked like she moved to look at me. “ No sir, that won't be necessary,” she walked off and towards the treeline. I couldn't tell if I saw more shadows or if my head was just getting one over on me. 

I got a call on my phone. I could hear the vibrations on the table. At this time I was with a girl named Mia And on this day she happened to get the closing shift and was just getting off. “ Hey love, I'm just getting off now.” I told her that I had gone a few minutes out to this cabin. It was her dad's idea. Get a cabin for a few days, it can be relaxing, he said.

“ Alright, it says that I'm 25 minutes out, I'm going to get gas and then I'll be over.” She said, I just stared still having that lady fresh in my mind. “Umm… Yeah I got a few things I gotta do then we can start dinner” I stated back. 

Right then I hear a slight ding noise right outside the sliding door in the living room. I admit if this was a horror movie I'd be the first to go because I just had to see what made the noise. I hear a less subtle sound of a bunch of things moving around. I go towards the sliding door and I tey to switch the barkyard light on but it won't work. So I go back to kitchen to get my phone and I go out the sliding door to see the rocks moved. Forming a cross with a huge smile in the middle. Was this that lady? This wasn't no little patch of dirt and rocks. This was the whole backyard.

As I go to turn back to go inside, I see the lady. This time she's really clear, like if I was watching this from the third person. She was Blonde with a red dress and really bright red high heels. I looked at her hand and there was a piece of rope. She plunged towards me with her arms open. I counter with a sidestep  and she catches me with her rope. I manage to throw it off and I have ran Into the house I know documenting this is the last thing I should do but I want someone to know what Happened. I hear her outside my door what do I do?
