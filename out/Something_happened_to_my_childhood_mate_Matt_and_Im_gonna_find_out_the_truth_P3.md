Part 3: Jacob's voice shattered the memory and I returned to reality, I was still on the phone!

“Er, sorry about that, I’ve been doing that lately…” I say, apologetically. 

“Recalling old memories, eh?” Jacob questions.

“Yeah…” I replied. I stay silent, I don’t know what to say and I’m hoping Jacob would say something. But he doesn’t. I take a deep breathe and finally break the uncomfortable silence:

“Jacob, mate, I’m going to have to go, talk to you later?” 

“Yeah, sure, mate.” Jacob responds and he hangs up immediately, I sigh in relief. As I get up from the stool I had been sitting on for the length of the call, Diana walks into the room, holding a bottle of LLb, Lemon Lime Bitters, an Aussie drink.

“How was the call?” Diana asks, smiling as she hands me the bottle. The bottle is cool, liquid condensing on the outside of the bottle. I look up at her and return her smile.

“It was fine, I guess, I didn’t really get the answers I was looking for.” I say. She didn’t question me when I said that. I hadn’t openly disclosed my latest obsession in Matt’s disappearance, but she knew, she could see it in my eyes.

“Why are you so interested in this, honey?” She asked, her smile faltering. I knew the question had been coming.

“Well… I dunno, I guess I just want to find out the truth, some serious shit happened to Matt, and I have this weird feeling that he might still be out there somewhere…” I responded. Diana nods and says:

“I’ll leave you be.” in a sad quality before she quickly slips out the room, leaving me to my own devices. I open the LLB slowly and take a swig. The liquid is refreshing, and it fizzes in my mouth in a pleasant way. I swallow and it fizzes all the way down. As I slowly down the drink, I review the flashback I had gotten on my call with Jacob in my head. Surely there was more to it than that? Surely I went back? Yes, there was more to it! I did go back, I remember it now… 

It was an overcast day, the kind where it looks like it’s going to rain but doesn’t. I remember getting up early that day, at like 5 in the morning. Now, I never get up at 5 in the morning willingly, not when I was 12, but I remember I did this time to get something without being noticed by my father.

At the time I was normally awake, my dad was in the kitchen for the whole duration of the time before I had to leave for school. When I had neared my teenage years, he had fallen into an alcohol addiction, a booze worshiper. So every morning, he was clutching a beer bottle, taking swigs out of it as he leaned against the breakfast bar. I felt pity for him, I really did. I felt really bad for him.

Despite his constant drinking, he never treated me nastily, he was a good father, that’s for sure. It was a horrible thing for a son who was so attached to his father to see him wasting away like that, horrible indeed. Anyway, as I had said, I had woken up early to get something without being seen. I sneaked into the kitchen at the crack of dawn, tiptoeing. I slid one of the cutlery drawers open and grabbed a steak knife. I then-

“What are you doing?” I whirled around to face my father, caught red handed. My father was holding a beer bottle in one hand, dressed in just a pair of baggy jeans, revealing his hairy bare torso. He looked at me and then at the steak knife in my hand, suspicious.

I felt myself turning red, face burning up. I felt deeply ashamed of myself. My father was a good father and I felt guilty to be doing something without permission. My father dug his free hand into his pocket, still gazing at me with a suspicious glare. I open my mouth to mutter out an apology, perhaps to give him a fabricated explanation-

“Here, take this one, it’s better.” He said, interrupting my thoughts as he held up a hand. My jaw dropped as I saw what he was holding. What lay in his palm, was a gleaming, high quality metallic switch blade, his very own. I was shocked and I didn’t know what to think or say. For all he knew, I was going to kill someone I hated at school with that knife, and he was willingly handing it to me. But, I think he knew the truth, it was in his eyes.

He knew what I had seen yesterday at school. I didn’t know how he knew, I had never told him of the events that happened the other day. As if reading my mind, he says softly: “I’ve seen it before… In my dreams… It’s a bad, bad place… It’s threatening to pull me down…” Immediately, he pushes the knife into my open hand and closes my fingers.

“Thanks, man.” I say softly, I often called my dad ‘man’ or ‘dude’ all the time. My dad nods at me, then walks over to the fridge, plops it open, and grabs a beer. I quickly scurry back into my room and literally dive into bed, falling asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow. I was awoken, groggy and tired, by my alarm. My eyelids were heavy and my legs were unready to bear my weight, but they did anyway as I forced myself to get up.

As I passed the gaming desk in my room, I spotted the switchblade my father had given me, lying there, and the memories of the early morning came back to me. I slunk down to the kitchen lazily and got myself a bowl of oats. You know, it’s funny how about a year ago, I hated oats. I hated the taste and texture of soggy cardboard in my mouth. I preferred Nitro-Grain back then, but as I neared my teen years, I became aware of my health.

I started eating healthier and working out, mainly for myself but also for the looks the girls gave me. My father was in the kitchen, drinking beer of course, his hands clutched around the bottle so tightly that his knuckles turned white. We were silent as I wolfed down my oats, and as he downed his beer. I was pretty damn nervous, I was scared to go back to that dreadful, wretched place, the ‘edge’.

Sheesh, just saying ‘the edge’ gives me goosebumps. That place provoked a form of abstract horror so unbearable that… That… I don’t know, I don’t know how to explain any of this shit. The rest of the morning was a blur, I got ready for school like normal and headed off. The lessons were boring and I tried to sleep through Mrs.Jess’s annoying high pitched voice as she taught maths.

“If a ladder is 10 m long and rests against a wall and the foot of the ladder is 6 m away from the wall, how high does it reach?” She asks the class, quickly jotting down the word problem onto a whiteboard, the marker squeaking annoyingly, the sound that makes chills run down your spine. No one responded and Mrs.Jess looked around, exasperated.

“Anyone?” She quickly scans the room before stopping at me.

“You, solve the problem.” She demands, impatiently.

“8. 8 metres.” I say, dryly. She tried to hide it but I knew she was shocked that I had known the answer, little did this fucker know, maths was my area of brilliance. Anyways, you guys don’t want to hear any of this.

When it was break time, I was a mess. I was sweating, biting at my nails, and my fingers kept wrapping around the switchblade hidden in my pocket. I was scared, that’s for sure. What happens if I went back to the chasm and I fall down that wretched, unholy thing? What happens if there are some evil entities or cultists, waiting for me so they can kill me? What if-

“Hey, are you alright?” My thought interrupted and I turned to face the voice. It was Keria. I could see her freckles sprinkled across her face and her vibrant green eyes. She tucks a strand of brown hair behind her ear as she waits for an answer.

“Er, hi. Yeah-I’m all good, thanks for asking.” I respond, a little shyly and awkwardly. Keria smiles and skips over to her friends. I look around and see the normal school-break activities. Was I really going to do this? ‘Yes, I will’ I thought to myself as I took a deep breath. Should I tell someone where I am going?

Maybe I should tell Jacob, but I don’t know where he is and I know he’ll probably know that I snuck out of school again so no worries. I walk over the shed, grope the brickwork with my right hand and grab the fence with my left and-

“Young man! What do you think you are doing?” Fuck! It was Mrs.Jess. I turned around and saw her wearing a neon green vest saying supervisor. Fuck! She never did supervisor duty, she only did it today just to piss me off and tell me off while I was playing. My mind swirled with lies and thoughts until one clicked in place. Bingo.

“I-I was just getting the ball behind the shed.” I was referring to the one I had seen yesterday when I had snuck out, the one wedge between the shed and the fence. Mrs.Jess quickly strode over to see if there was even a ball behind the fence, and then turned back to face me, narrowing her eyes. 

“Go on, get it.” I did as I was told. I squeezed into the gap, retrieved the ball, and squeezed back out. She frowned and me and whispered: “I’m watching you.” Before striding off, back to our classroom probably. I looked around quickly, the coast was clear. I let go of the ball and delivered one hell of a kick up into the sky before I quickly climbed over the shed.

When I was on top of the shed, I braced myself as I threw myself down onto the other side. I had escaped once more. I had gotten to the edge quicker than yesterday. When I had reached that chasm, it was dead silent. Like, literally the quiet was deafening. It shouldn’t have been quiet, it’s not natural. There should be the chirps of insects and the humming of birds.

But there wasn’t. I looked at the chasm, staying a safe distance away. It seemed… Bigger, if that was even possible. I looked at the other side. Something was wrong, something was different. Some sort of pillar, a chunk of rock, stood in the middle of the field on the other side. ‘That wasn’t there before…’ I thought to myself. I wanted to check it out, but that would mean jumping over the chasm…

So after a lot of commitment and courage… I jumped the distance. I was relieved when I landed on the other side. It wasn’t even close. I cautiously went over to the pillar and I saw it was a gravestone, and there was writing carved on the rock, an obituary I think. It read: 

 

Here Lies Matthew Andersons…

He was born in $@($\*(#@> and died in \*@$>?!...

He died when he was messing around. He accidentally summoned a demon which proceeded to pull him down through the edge…

He is dearly missed by the man in the trees who watches him at night… 

In any other ‘normal’ situation, I would burst out laughing, sides splitting! But this, no, this just made me uneasy and scared. It ran chills down my spine. I had many questions, since when was this gravestone here? Who wrote the obituary? Suddenly, I felt as if I was being watched and a knot formed in my stomach.

I didn’t need to look up, but I did anyway. A figure stood in the distance. It looked like a shadow, not like the skin was black, but like the figure seemed to literally be made of a black mist or fog. Patches of the fog shifted and pulsated in a sickly way and bile rose up in my throat. I slid my hands into my pockets, feeling the  coolness of the switchblade and then ran!
