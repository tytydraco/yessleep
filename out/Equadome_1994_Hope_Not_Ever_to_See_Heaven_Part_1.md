Trigger Warnings: Mentions sex. Animal Abuse (just a few sentences. Not the focus of the story). Mention of suicide.

Nobody knew quite how it happened, but it had been nearly six months since my sister was found dead, shredded and crushed, on the stone altars of the Equadome and now we sped down the dark road through an abyss of trees directly into its embrace. My friend Crow was in the front flicking the ashes from her cigarette out the window and talking loudly over another pounding Korn song. Jason drove, nodding slowly to the music or whatever Crow was saying. I sat in the backseat flicking a Zippo staring at the back of her black pixie cut. I could smell her, sweet and earthy, through the cool midwestern air blowing into the backseat. I couldn’t help but think of her, even though my sister was dead and it was my fault.

I  hadn’t slept well since it happened. It wasn’t just my sister I lost. We were all best friends–Crow, Jason, my sister, and I. We grew up trampling through the woods of eastern Missouri raising hell as suburbia grew up around us. Now that she was gone, it was as if the earth had shifted by several degrees–just enough to send us spiraling towards and away from each other all at once. But it was more than a conventional sadness I felt .  It was the secret that I kept. It was our last conversation. It was my sister’s words *I can’t live with this.* No amount of alcohol stolen from parents’ liquor cabinets or shake weed would make these words go away for long.

Crow was the first to suggest to me that we go to the Equadome. After fucking on the sticky vinyl seats of her parents’ Buick, I sat with her on the hood passing a joint watching the setting sun glisten amber over the Missouri River. We had been doing that since my sister died. The earth shifted me towards her against what I knew to be safe. 

“I think it would be good for you. Maybe help you sleep better if you knew what happened,” she said. 

“Why do you give a shit?” 

It wasn’t a question steeped in self-pity. It was genuine. Growing up, I thought of Crow as devoid of such feelings. At ten years old, we had found a fallen crow’s nest deep in the woods. The hatchlings stretched their necks to the sky calling for their mother. I wanted to bring them home.  With no words, she jumped high in the air coming down on them with both feet. They convulsed in the nest so she did it three more times until they were feathers and mangled meat. It’s better this way, she explained. Now they are free. Many times since, she’d tell me that she wanted to be as free as a crow. One or both of these is why we called her Crow. 

“Don’t be such an asshole. You know I give a shit,” she took in a big hit and exhaled. “There’s something for you there. I know it.”

“I want to go at night.”

She didn’t ask why, just accepted it. I needed to see it how my sister saw it. I owed it to her, I thought, to put myself at equal risk. 

Crow didn’t want to bring Jason, but I asked him a week later . Going at night was a hard sell. Easier to see anything the cops missed, Jason said but we both  knew he was only scared. Even before my sister’s death, every high schooler and most adults feared the Equadome. They all knew the stories, had seen the news articles over the years. It was a place that created the insane or at least drew them–a dark place.  

Jason changed his mind when Crow and I said we’d go without him. Fuck that, Jason said, I’m not letting you all go alone. Crow only shrugged and we set a night in two weeks after graduation. Crow had already dropped out, but Jason wanted to keep focused until then.   

The Equadome dwelled deep in the Busch Wildlife Conservation Area, a proper home littered with World War era storage bunkers and cemeteries even older still from towns long dead. The sun never shone quite right there, as if through a thin film that had bubbled over the land. At night, you were set on some ethereal plane,  losing all sense of time and space.  It was black as we drove except the headlights of Jason’s 1980 Malibu, the leafless trees reaching out from the side of the road beckoning us to join, trapping us forever. 

This whole place must exist someplace else, I thought, just off enough that people did things, terrible things. I thought about the little girl tied to a tree, left to die just five years back by some faceless monster. Where was he now? Was his sister under such a spell? They were heading towards the heart of this place. These were the things I wanted to understand. 

I also thought of my sister as we drove. The music, the wind from the window, Crow and Jason laughing all fell back and I was alone in a room of brocade curtains coming ever closer threatening to suffocate me. I rubbed my forearm with my forefinger–my skin itchy with crescent scabs and scars–and then plunged my nail in drawing blood. I pinched hard until I was back.

We were already parked within the trees at the chain-linked entrance. What are you doing? Come on, they called from outside of the car. I got out and came around the front, the soil foreign and spongy underfoot as if I had stepped onto another planet. Crow leaned against the hood flipping her butterfly knife with practiced precision. Jason squatted beside her.

“I don’t think we should be doing this,” Jason said.

“Don’t be such a fucking pussy,” Crow said laughing and rubbing Jason’s shoulder. “You’re the biggest one here.” She closed the knife and put it in her pocket. 

I noticed the rub and felt the pangs of jealousy. Since we decided to go, Crow had been cold to me. The tilt of the Earth shifted her away and towards Jason, I imagined.

“I’m going,” I said, pulling a flashlight from my back pocket. 

I came through a hole in the fence and stepped down the gravel road into the darkness. They followed and then pulled ahead of me–arm in arm, talking in whispers. I focused on the nape of Crow’s neck, so intently that I could see the soft white hairs. I yearned to touch them, to smell the leather of her jacket, to slip my hand in her baggy jeans. Why was I out of her light? It rose up hot in me, made me dizzy.  I had a thought I hadn’t had before. I wanted to strangle her or run and die myself. She might see me then. How can I think of such things, I thought, even while standing at the foot of where my sister died, where I caused her to die?

The fall night air warmed as we neared the main structure like heat radiating from a body. I thought I might have been the only one to notice. We came around the last bank of trees and the sky opened up into a full blood red moon. I would have sworn it was white as snow when we left St. Charles, but now it stood watch corrupted by this new unfamiliar air. Below it stabbing deep into the night sky, the concrete spires of the Equadome rose like leviathan.

Its history lay heavy on it, scrawled across its stone faces framed in rebar, spray painted epitaphs that spoke to some darker insight, *Rush, Trapped, Satan save me, This way to Heaven, Hell.* What stories each might tell. It took its first breath in 1942 as a water treatment plant for the Weldon Springs Munitions plant, birthing death across the European war front. Peace came. It was abandoned and even through its decay, it managed to live on, twisted by what would come over the next fifty years. A rectangular tower with a single, windowless black cavity from which a sniper shot at passing cars. A domed water tower atop concrete, spider-like legs where two brothers once drowned. A long graffitied hall with stone altars where Satanic cults were rumored to make animal sacrifices. Deep in its bowels, a black labyrinth of tunnels and rusted government furniture they called *Hell* where girls were assaulted and the cult performed its darkest rituals. These were all stories, but they all rang true when you stepped within its crumbling skin. 

And then there was *Heaven,* the Equadome’s most prominent feature. A tower of twisted metal and concrete jutting like a dagger from the heart of the main building into all sorts of skies, gloomy, blue, red-mooned nights like this night. Even the birds seemed to only pass in flight. Nobody knew what was in *Heaven*. Nobody could find its entrance as if it were purposely, benevolently hidden–only revealed to chosen wanderers. Even its name took on a new, sinister meaning because it existed in this place. This was the place below which many jumpers had been found on the stones below. This was the place from which my sister fell or threw herself. She had discovered its truths. 

“What do you think happened to her?” Jason said, pulling his golden hair into a ponytail. “The cops said she fell from *Heaven,* but there’s no windows or nothing. There’s no way to get on the outside.  How could that even fuckin’ happen?”

“That’s why we’re here,” I said annoyed, throwing a rock I hadn’t remembered picking up into the woods.  “You’ve got to focus. You and Crow are laughing and talking away like this is some joke. She was my sister.”

“She was my friend too. We may have been even closer…” This was too much for me and I hurtled myself at  him, but Crow jumped between.

“Fucking stop. We’re here for a reason. Let’s focus on finding our way up to *Heaven.*” Crow had told us earlier that she had heard from a guy at school who heard from another guy that there was a way up to *Heaven,* that he had left painted blue rocks in *Hell* marking the path. “Let’s get moving.”

The world was silent, not a breeze nor the cry of an owl nor the sound of cars from the road. As we neared the entrance, heat radiated from within and the gravel devolved into mud grabbing and pulling at our feet.  The main building was a long rectangular cement structure lined with tall windows most of which had been broken over the years. The red moon illuminated a large mural painted on the outer wall half obscured by dry vines – a mural of a man’s head in terror just before being pulled beneath the soil, his hands crooked in desperation to keep himself up. That looks about right, Jason half joked. I avoided looking through the black, empty windows as if something might jump out or some red eyes might show themselves. Why was she here?, I thought. 

We stepped through a small doorway on the farside of the structure and into a vast cement room where darkness filled wherever our light did not shine.
