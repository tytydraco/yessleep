Wellp. You know what they say, having isn't nearly as good as wanting.

I don't see any harm in getting straight to the point. I have nothing to lose, and I'm only twenty. Probably won't make it to twenty-one. Heh, that's just a joke, don't worry about me. I think. I dunno. I'm kinda scattered right now.

I'm a student at Brookwood Westonheiser Community College in Timberfall, Pennsylvania. Smallest town in the state, you have to zoom in so close to find it on Google Maps that you'll forget what you were doing by the time the words appear, and it doesn't have any universities.

The Big BW has no dorms, but there's an apartment neighborhood across the street, mainly for student housing (you don't have to be one to get an apartment, but good LUCK living around the noise and shenanigans if you aren't part of the party), and I live there. I'd bounced around a few summer jobs for a couple years after high school to afford it and the college tuition since my parents couldn't help. We were pretty poor, but finally I had a job I could start to grow from.

The lords and ladies treat the neighborhood like a gigantic dormitory. We have a fake fraternity, and they have a fake sorority. Of course, being community college kids, we had no idea how those REAL things were supposed to work. So they just treat the two groups like clubs. No big deal. No heavy hazing, no bullying, just an initiation and then you're in.

I don't know what the women do, but the guys keep changing it up every few new students. The current thing gets old, or someone comes up with some new stupid thing, or oops, the guy who was in charge of the old thing got arrested for selling drugs, heh heh, we don't talk about that, you can't prove we know anything, look a monkey, *zoom.*

I didn't have to worry. I was new, had only been there a month, and had no ties to the old things. I'd been talking to the guys about trying to join their "frat" for a while, and it seemed they'd finally come up with a new initiation. Boy oh boy, there's nothing like being the guinea pig for a new way to scare the newbies. But if you don't join, you're basically never included in anything fun they do, and I figured, the past initiations they described weren't *that* bad.

There was occasional trespassing, but no vandalism, no destruction of property. The worst that had ever happened was having to climb up the side of someone's house in the neighborhood across the woods and put a jaunty top hat on their weather vane.

Seriously. Hoodlums? Up to no good? You coppers will have to arrest these guys for being goofballs before you ever pin them for anything serious. Drug Donny was an outlier, and nobody liked him that much anyway, so no surprise to learn that he was not only doing lines every night, but also fattening his pockets handing it out, just to buy more. What a useless cycle for a complete loser.

But enough about then. Here's now.

The initiation was to simply enter a broken down old shack of an abandoned house at the edge of the woods on the neighborhood across (seriously, nobody knows what it's even called, we never go far enough to find an entrance sign, especially since we happen upon it from the back side).

In the house was a lot of broken down old furniture, broken wooden crates scattered here and there, and scratch marks on the walls, like from a knife or some other kind of tool. They spelled out rough letters forming things like

"Stay and feed me."

"Close your eyes and have a surprise."

"Speak to me baby ;) "

Yeah, literally a fuckin' emoji scratched into a rotting wooden wall like by some wild animal. It looked like a joke. Who wouldn't think so? Sounded like the ladies had been here, and had done this, waiting for us guys to notice so we'd get all interested and confused, and then they'd just come and laugh at us and confess after watching us get all excited and mystified for a while. I dunno. Like I said, I don't know what they do.

I also don't know if it was one of them who did it, or if the person I'm thinking of is, or WAS one of them. The sorority is as fake as the fraternity, but maybe there's something more to it.

One of the messages, down in a corner full of cobwebs I had to stomp on to be able to read it, was actually some weird code looking thing. The guys had found it, and I was supposed to go in the house alone, recording myself first-person on my phone, find the code, and read it, then stay in the house for an hour. Either nothing would happen and I got to leave, or something would happen, and I'd have to stay to see it out.

I was in the corner, the darkest, rattiest looking one, and raised my boot high.

*THUD.*

There was a message behind all the dust, scribbled by the same sharp thing, but slightly narrower and neater.

"HD189773b."

I read the code out loud slowly, smirking to myself. "What a waste of time. Let me guess, some of you guys are here right now, and you're gonna make animal noises and scare me?"

"Why would I scare you?" whispered a sultry voice behind me. I jumped a foot and turned around.

The window on the other side of the room now shone with a blue light, as though the full moon were looking in through it even though it hadn't been there seconds ago. But someone was standing in the way, blocking the light.

It was the slim figure of a woman, her features barely visible, with soft dark pajamas, and dark shoulder-length messy hair sort of fluttering there.

I shivered. There was no breeze. Nothing to move her.

She stepped closer. "Stay with me and play," she whispered.

"You're from the sorority," I said, trying to stay calm. No reason to be afraid. After all, there was a naked woman about my age, maybe a few years older, standing right in front of me. What WAS there to be afraid of? "You're a part of them, right?"

"Sorority?" she giggled. "I'm not interested. I'd rather make *you* a part of *me."*

Okay, that one was creepy, not gonna lie. But I couldn't see any pockets on her clothes (no shit, it was nearly pitch black in the house, but I wasn't thinking straight), and I didn't see her concealing a weapon anywhere. Big brain time for me, huh?

Plus, I was a twenty year old college kid. Basically, an idiot. And when a twenty year old single guy is faced with a sultry, comfortably dressed woman in the dark talking mysterious shit, running in fear isn't exactly the first response that comes to mind. Sue me for being a dude, okay?

She came closer and closer until she was right on me. She slowly put her arms around me and whispered into my ear, "no resistance? No fighting? You could be a lot of fun." She kissed my cheek. I shivered again, and it wasn't quite from nervousness that time.

But then things become a blur. I feel like I must have sort of passed out, but there was a wonderful buzzing feeling in my head, and it happened so slowly. It was like that wonderful feeling you get from ASMR, but times twenty, like I was getting massaged inside of my head.

Finally, I woke up suddenly, as if I'd stood up in my sleep and then fallen backwards onto the bed stiff as a board. Only this wasn't a bed, it was the floor of the falling apart house, and it was early Saturday morning, dawn peeking through the open windows and the doorless frame in front of me.

I was lucky. There were occasionally sightings of things like foxes and coyotes around here. We're pretty close to the country and farmlands, and I don't know how those kinds of animals deal with sleeping humans, but I'm just glad none of them found me.

I felt sharply awake, but also tired, like I'd only slept half the night. Nevertheless, I found my phone a few feet away, battery dead.

All I cared about in that moment was the video. The fuckin' *video,* dude, it had to be insane. I ran all the way back to the neighborhood.

When I finally got it charged up enough to turn on (during which I was explaining the whole thing to the guys and why I hadn't come out all night, because they'd thought I was pranking them by acting like I'd gone missing), I played it. There were about twenty of us in all (not the whole neighborhood, thank God), so front row seating for my tiny Samsung Galaxy Ace wasn't really convenient, but we made it work.

It captured everything, from the moment I walked in, to that woman and her mysterious words (they all hooted and hollered and slapped me on the back when she held me and kissed my cheek, but they didn't seem to get what was going on or who she was), and then...

Then it got weird.

There it was, that moment I couldn't remember, when everything became a senseless blur. She reached down and took my phone out of my hand, setting it gently on the ground. We were both visible in the recording for a moment.

She reached out and touched my head with both hands, and my face seemed to droop with langour. She leaned forward and kissed me fully, and started walking me slowly backward until we were out of view.

There was nothing  but the soft sounds of her kisses, and small sighs from her...and...

And some kind of *strangling* sound. Was that coming from me? Sort of high pitched. Like something was sucking the breath out of me from far away.

The guys were all staring at the phone, dumbfounded. They kept watching until the video ended, and nothing any further out of the ordinary happened.

In the end, the guys were laughing and clapping and slapping me on the back, declaring that I was *way* beyond a member of the frat now. Some of them thought I'd tricked them back somehow, but they weren't even mad.

But I was the only one creeped out by it all. Yes, it had felt wonderful, but what the fuck had "it" been? Was she on some kind of heavy drug that just got into my system when she kissed me, just by breathing into my mouth? Was that possible?

Had she done the thing that seemed kind of obvious? She HAD walked away from the phone, after all. But I couldn't remember anything vivid. I wasn't sure. Should I have felt disgusted? Violated? Why would I, if I wasn't even sure she'd done anything more than holding and kissing me?

I tried to put it out of my head.

The whole day went by pretty smoothly, and I didn't have much to do. But the boys took me out to dinner that night at a buffet, and I have to admit, we were kind of rowdy. We had a corner to ourselves, and may have accidentally driven away a few people to different seats farther off.

A waitress came by once with a resigned expression that said she thought she'd get yelled at and belittled, and opened her mouth, probably to ask us to quiet down.

But it was the leader of the current group, Foxy, who saved the day. With a big smile and a wink at her, he reached into his leather jacket and pulled out a fifty dollar bill, then handed it to her wordlessly.

She turned red, opening and closing her mouth like a fish for a second, a flustered smile appearing and disappearing a few times. Then she nodded and walked away, presumably to tell her boss she had no idea what the hell the complaining customers were talking about, she'd only found a group of nice modern gentlemen in that corner eating half the buffet, nothing to worry about.

We soon left, separating to our cars and got home without incident.

But that night.

LAST FUCKING NIGHT.

It's Sunday morning right now. I'm scared out of my mind. Well, kinda. Should I be scared? HOW scared should I be? Maybe this is nothing. Am I overreacting? I should probably get back to the fuckin' story already.

I fell asleep around midnight in my studio apartment. Nice, peaceful place. I even turned on a fan and some ASMR.

But soon I woke up to the feeling of something caressing my cheek. I sat up in a terror, face to face with *her.* She lowered her hand from my face, smiling lovingly at me. She was squatted down next to my mattress, stroking my cheek with her fingertips, dressed in those soft dark clothes again.

I scrambled backwards off my mattress, and she giggled. As I stood up, the lights turned on, but not very brightly.

There were half a dozen orange lamps spaced around my apartment on little wooden tables. Nothing else but my bed, the lamps on the tables, her, and...

...And no front door. In front of me, the room stretched a short distance, and then turned into a dark hallway going to the right.

"Let's play," she whispered, standing up and approaching me. Her smile was less frightening and more seductive, more beautiful. In the better lighting I could see that her pajamas were pitch black, and she was tanned; I would have guessed she was Brazilian, I'm not sure. And she was drop dead gorgrous.

She took my shoulders gently and kissed my cheek, running her lips down my face toward my neck, and I shivered, getting lost in the moment. She kissed me a few more times, lower. Under the ear. Lower...

But then my senses returned, and I awkwardly jump-stepped to the side, almost losing my balance. My awareness came back, and as I turned toward her, she smiled at me, sticking her tongue out and wiggling it playfully. "Have more," she murmured, reaching for me.

I turned and bolted toward the far side of the room, and stopped at the entrance to the dark hallway. "What the fuck is this?" I said to her, turning to face her again. "I'm dreaming, right?"

I know, I should have been *way* more freaked out. I seemed too calm and collected for what was going on, didn't I? But I've never been one to collapse into a blubbering mess over something terrifying. I either question it, or I run, and I don't stumble and trip over all that pesky air, thanks, horror movies.

"Absolutely not," she whispered. "I don't make people dream. I TAKE dreams from them. I'm better than any dream, Cam. My games are more real, more fun, than anything you could hope to see in your boring little outside world life. And if I win, I get to have more of you."

Her eyes twinkled. "Or, you could just give in right now, and let me feed now. Do you like the sound of that, Cam?" she asked softly, staring at me with doe eyes. "Do you like the thought of standing there, defenseless, and letting me feed on you, not fighting me, not stopping me, just letting me take more and more?"

"The fuck are you talking----" But I couldn't finish. She pounced, running at me full speed, and I had to turn and run too.

The hallway wasn't as long as I thought. Lucky I had my arms out in front of me; seconds later my hands slammed into another wall, and my arms sort of crumpled, absorbing the impact not too painfully and stopping me from snapping my nose against the plaster. To my left was another hallway, with a dim orange light shining from another turn past it.

I took the corner at a full run. I could see again. I went beyond it, turned right and ran past another lamp...

...And ended at a two-way intersection. The hall became a T, and there were more halls to the left and right.

"You have one hour," her voice called from behind me. "If I don't pin you in one hour, you win the night!" She was still running. I took the left turn.

Then a right at a three way intersection. And went straight at a four way.

The entire building had become gigantic. A maze of short, dimly lamplit corridors.

I was internally cursing, trying to convince myself she was lying, that it HAD to be a dream. It couldn't *not* be one, could it? Half of me really did want to stop. I was kind of excited at the prospect of just not resisting her, letting her approach me, and kiss me again, the way she had last night. Whatever it had been, it had been so wonderful that it had fogged *everything,* and part of me wanted that feeling again. The wonderful buzz through my whole head, like feathers massaging my brain.

In the end, red flags and common sense won. I kept running.

Somehow, I kept it up for what might have been more than a half hour. But eventually, I came to a dead end, long after I'd stopped hearing her footsteps and laughter. I'm pretty sure she was going slow on purpose to let me gain some distance, enjoying her game of cat and mouse.

The dead end was a small, widened rectangular block at the end of a corridor. From far away, I'd thought the left and right sides were more hallway turns, but they were just blank walls. A large, beautiful bed took up the space on the right. Big, white and with fluffy, thick sheets.

"Mmmhh," I heard her exhale softly behind me, and I whirled around to see her at the far end of the corridor. She came to me, and the hallway wasn't big enough for me to have a shot at slipping past. If I tried, she'd jump on me and pin me easy.

"Go ahead, baby," she said softly. "Get in bed and let's have a cuddle. Give up now. You played good, you tried hard. There's still ten minutes, and you're trapped. No chance of getting out. Aren't you sleepy? Don't you want to lie down and have more kisses?"

With nowhere to go, I backed up further into the room, away from the bed. She grinned at me and walked faster. I tried to slip around her once she was inside, but she grabbed me and wrestled me toward the bed laughing, and I have to admit my resistance wasn't very strong anymore.

She wrangled me into the bed easily, climbed on top of me, kissed me deeply, and the soothing darkness settled in like a blanket. The lamps went out. That buzzing feeling filled my head faster than before, spreading down toward my shoulders, filling my neck. It felt like it was even sending little barbs down into my chest. Whatever it was, it was stronger than the frst time, and it was *wonderful.*

You'd think the law of diminishing returns would apply to future occurrences, but nope. It was the opposite. For at least a couple hours I felt heightened euphoria all over. I was a little more aware of the whole thing; time was a bit of a blur, but I could feel things more solidly, and was more aware of my surroundings. And it just made the whole thing that much better. I could feel her lips on my face, I could feel her hair tickling my neck, I could feel her hands on my back, her soft sleeves like silky down against my skin.

Finally, she was laying next to me in the bed in total darkness, the doorway gone and replaced with solid wall, no way out. She held me close, cuddling me, and we slept.

I woke up just an hour ago in my own apartment, as exhausted as if I hadn't slept at all.

The bed I woke up in was not my bed. It was the big white one with the fluffy sheets.

The apartment had all my stuff still, but now there was a small wooden table by the door with a lamp on it.

I got up and staggered to the table, examining the lamp up close. The table. I turned around and checked out the bed. I was too tired to think clearly.

*This could not be real.*

I stumbled to the kitchen sink and drank a few glasses of water, and went to the bathroom to try and clean myself up and make sense of it all.

I looked like I hadn't slept in a *week,* much less a day. My hair was ruffled and greasy, my face was pale, and there were dark circles under my eyes.

And, uh. There were light, glossy lip prints on my cheeks and neck. I squinted in confusion, and licked my lips.

They tasted sugary. They tasted...like *her.* That sweet taste of her kiss. I hadn't even realized it had had a taste at all, I'd been so under her spell.

I leaned closer and looked at my neck. It wasn't too visible, but I could just barely make out faint prints in the skin, like her fingers, as though she had grabbed my throat while kissing me. Was she being violent? Or just passionate?

What could I do? What *should* I do?

I don't know. Look, you guys will judge me, I know it. But at that moment, I wanted to keep it all to myself.

Look, maybe something happened and gave me a weird dream, or a nightmare, if you could call it that. But at the end of the day, that was all it had *been.* A dream. I couldn't prove anything. It wasn't real like the first time. It COULDN'T have been real. She could NOT have actually entered my apartment, literally twisted the physical reality of the place like some dimensional warping demon, and then kissed me into a near coma in a queen sized bed for real, right?

So what good would it have done to tell any of the guys, or try to talk to anyone with any real authority, like a cop? Nobody could help. Was there even anything *to* help?

I mean...dreams like that...they're *common,* right? That happens all the time, right?

But you people----heh, this is the PERFECT place to come clean. Nobody can track me down, so nobody can book me into a mental institution.

YOU people will back me up, right? This is just some common thing that happens, isn't it. A harmless dream, and I should just keep quiet and enjoy it. I bet you'll agree with me. After all, I have zero way to escape it, so it *has* to be something good. My dream angel, making me feel heavenly while I sleep.

I'M OKAY, RIGHT??!?!?!??!?!?!!!!

I took a long shower and toweled off, stepping back out of the bathroom with it wrapped around my waist. With my eyes less bleary and feeling more awake and refreshed, I walked back into the main room. I had to check those things out again, figure out what was going on.

The bed didn't have any tags on it or any logo, brand or anything. Just blank and generic. The blankets, too.

The table looked hand made. Nothing on it out of the ordinary, just some type of light tan wood and white painted legs. Small but strong and sturdy.

The lamp was made of heavy dark brass, and the lightbulb was shaped strangely, not round, but rather with a lot of angles, like some freaky badly rendered polygon. Switching it on, I found it to be kind of dim. Not good for full lighting, but good enough to make a room feel cozy in the evening for binge watching your favorite show.

After some thought, I unscrewed the lightbulb. I peered at the top; nothing there. I looked at the screw; no markings.

I looked at the stem just above the conductor.
