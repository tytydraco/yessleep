\[tw death/graphic injury/surgery/very brief mention of self injury\]

  


the pregnancy was painful for Anne. she was in and out of the doctor's office, and i grew to expect her to stop by. the judgmental, human part of me, wanted to believe she was trying to get more prescription medication. maybe it's because i've just seen so much of it from others.  


Anne was in her late twenties. she and her husband had started stopping by regularly with complaints of pain, and the baby moving too much. saying it made her skin feel tight when it pressed, and saying she was nervous. it was her first pregnancy after all. 

she'd been seeing a gynecologist as well, but she seemed to be wanting something no one could give her judging by how she would show up with the same symptoms despite any pain medication the doctor would put her on, and judging by how she would still show up despite the gynecologist telling her there's nothing wrong. 

this is why a part of me wanted to believe it was for medication. especially by how she would cry. she was always crying. i'd seen many crocodile tears during my time at the hospital. desperate for a pill or a needle to be shoved into them. any way they could get a buzz, they would take it. i'd seen someone break a finger for it. i know it was self inflicted. but the doctor would tell me not to assume. it was our job to treat them no matter what. i guess he was right.   


one day Anne decided to give us lots of trouble. coming in while her husband was at work. must've been an emergency. she'd been having a lot of those. but this time was different. she was very distraught as per usual, but stubborn. she refused to leave without something being done. we attempted to calm her down but she wasn't having it. she didn't know what she wanted us to do, but she wanted us to come up with something. 

the doctor stepped aside for a moment and asked if i could run an x-ray for her. just to remind her again that her baby is fine. she is fine. everyone is fine. this would be the third x-ray we've done in an attempt to ground her since she began visiting us. as i had her lay down, i found myself alone with her in this dim room. i could only imagine what was running through the doctor's mind at this point. likely planning to send her somewhere else. we obviously couldn't treat her, if there was anything to treat.

i immediately noticed on the screen what i initially thought was a deformity. it alarmed me. we hadn't noticed this before. 



i soon realized it was worse.

  


it was all a blur after i called the doctor in to take a look, he immediately called for more staff on hand, rushing her into surgery.

the doctor and i were allowed in despite not being the ones operating. we'd dealt with this case so long, we wanted to see what was really going on with her. and it would be a learning experience for me, seeing the inner workings of the body up close. we dressed in a rush, sanitizing ourselves and slipping masks over our mouths.  


unfortunately for Anne, it was an unspoken understanding that the baby would have to be removed.

 opening her up, everyone's demeanor seemed to break away from the cold and professional. the room was filled with confusion, gloved hands pausing over their work.

brushing shoulders with the surgeons as they spoke amongst themselves and to the doctor, the voices were muffled to me. my ears ringing as voices faded to silence, and i stared at the little corpse nestled inside her. 

it's skull had been damaged, and opened in an area. brain matter messy and threatening to escape its skull. there was also a hole in the uterus itself, lined up perfectly with the baby's injury. 



it didn't make sense.



this injury was purely internal. no external wounds or anything.

and the baby had been perfectly fine two weeks ago.

i looked closer at the head, still trying to stay out of the way of their work.

there were indents all around the hole of the skull. overlapping each other, over and over and over. it wasn't a clean injury. it was many, many, attempts.

these were teeth marks.



and as i looked into the gash in the uterus i saw two eyes staring back.

  


Anne never spoke of a conjoined twin.
