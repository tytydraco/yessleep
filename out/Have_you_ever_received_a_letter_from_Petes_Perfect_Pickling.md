“Excuse me?”  I asked the boy in front of me. That wasn’t the question I expected when they brought him in.    
  
“Have you ever gotten a letter from Pete’s Perfect Pickling? Believe me, I understand how strange I'm sounding, but I’m not insane. I know what I did, and know how crazy I sound, but please, you have to understand, I only did what was necessary.” I sat across from him behind the glass wall. He sat there handcuffed to the desk, his eyes staring right into mine. Eyes so anguished yet determined.    
  
"Jacob, I've read the reports the police gave me and I know how they view you, but I want to understand your point of view. You see, I don’t think you’re a bad kid. I'll be completely honest with you, the reason you’re here today is because the court wanted an expert to examine you.” I calmly spoke to the boy. Yes, boy. Jacob Madden, sixteen years old and found guilty of triple homicide and sentenced to fifteen years; fifteen years if he wasn’t found mentally insane that is. He sat there in silence for a few minutes before lowering his head.   
  
“Where do you want me to even start.” His voice was erratic as if he couldn't find the words.   
  
“Tell me about your parents. What does your father do” It’s a simply question relative to the main issue, but far enough away from the subject to not send him into a panic attack.   
  
“My parents? Well, my Dad works at a construction agency uptown. He draws up plans and often leaves to potential work sites throughout the country.”    
  
“You mentioned work visits. At the time of the ‘incidents’ he and your mother were out of town on a work visit, correct.” I knew all this of course, but I wanted him to start talking. Now though, with what I know, I wish I had left that instant.    
  
“Yes. Mom and Dad were out of town for the entire week and I was supposed to take care of Eliza and Kenton. I was supposed to take care of them. “He repeated that last mantra as his voice broke.   
  
“Can you start there? From when your parents left.” I needed to know exactly what happened. What happened for this young boy to butcher his best friend, oldest sister and his fourteen-year-old brother.   
  
“I didn't think I’d able to take care of them for the entire week, so I asked Helen if she could drive down and help, and she agreed. It was Friday morning when I first received the letters.” He started tapping erratically on the counter. “Can I have something to drink, please?” I motioned to one of the guards nearby and they handed him a glass of water.   
  
“You mentioned letters? What were they about.”   
  
“Instructions. It said it was from ‘Pete’s Perfect Pickling’ in big sloppy words, and in the inside of it were instructions in stylized letters, but it wasn’t hard to read or anything. I knew what it said, I couldn't have read it wrong. I promise I didn’t misread them.”    
  
“What did the letter tell you to do?”    
  
“It said ‘Would you be so kind as to kill your neighbor’s cat for me.’” He took a long sip from his water. “Of course, I didn’t kill it. I wasn't about to kill an animal because some random letter told me to, as I mentioned, I'm not insane.” He stared into the water before he began again in a small voice. “The next day when I went to get the mail there was another letter. But this time it had two pieces of paper; the first was another note, the second a picture. The note read ‘Would you be so kind as to kill your other dog for me.”   
  
“Other dog? You had two dogs, correct? What happened to the first?”   
  
“Yea, we had two, Roofus and Germs. The second piece of paper was a picture. It was of Roofus, but.... It was only his head. It was a picture of Roofus’ head, severed from his body, like it was pulled apart. I was terrified, and I didn’t know what to do, but I still wasn’t about to kill my dog. I tried to call the police you know, but they wouldn't answer.”    
  
“So, what did you do?”    
  
“Nothing. I did nothing, and the next morning when the mail came in there was another letter. I opened it of course. What else was I supposed to do?” His voice was teetering on tears. “Two papers again, a picture and a note. The picture was of my friend, John. He was dead, I know he was, and his legs, I couldn't see them, all that remained were trails of blood.”   
  
“On the report it said that John Anderson’s body was found underneath your house with his legs severed from his torso. Did you put him there?” I asked as gently as I could. The police found John after they searched the house, beneath the floor boards. They never found his legs though, just his body.   
  
“No. I didn't even know that they found his body.” He sounded sincere, but that’s why he was here, to determine if he was going to prison, or to a mental asylum.   
  
“You mentioned a note with. What did it say? “   
  
His voice was quiet and I could barely hear him. “It said, ‘would you be so kind as to cut out your girlfriend’s tongue.’ I was scared, so scared and I didn’t know what to do. I couldn't hurt her, but what was I supposed to do? I did nothing, again. My sister didn’t come home that night, I called and called but she didn’t answer her phone, and I knew. I knew deep inside that she wasn’t coming home ever again.”   
  
“Your sister’s phone said that it had nine miscalls, and one successful. What happened on that last call?”   
  
“When she called me, I was so happy, I cried.  But it wasn’t a normal call, it was a video call.” He took a long breath and his next words were shaky. “She couldn't have called me. She didn’t call me! Something else did. Something called me and it paraded her in front of the camera. It was revolting, her limbs were being stretched and tangled together. Her arms and legs wouldn't stop contorting around each other, they just kept twisting till she was a knot of malformed limbs, and that noise. All I could hear was that goddamn snapping of her bones. Docter, I can't explain it but I know what I saw, I know it was real.” A tear fell down his face. “They said I killed John, and they said I killed Helen.” His lips formed into a joyless smile as more tears rolled off his face. “And Doc, I think I did.”    
  
We sat in silence for a few minutes while Jacob collected himself. The official report stated that Helen Anderson’s body was found stuffed inside the washing machine in the basement. The water was not even drained when she was found, her body bloated and bent, contorted in on itself in dozens of places. The most disturbing part the autopsy revealed was that the injuries didn’t kill her, it was the water drowning her that killed her, not the bones in her legs and arms being turned to mush.   
  
“Tell me about your younger sister, Eliza. What was she like?”    
  
“She was.... Well, she was kind of a brat. I know most older brothers are supposed to love their baby sisters, but I hated her, and I think she hated me. She was just so spoiled, always crying and whining whenever something didn’t go her way, and it wasn’t just me she hated, she hated everyone and everything. She was a miserable child and seemed to only find joy in making others feel just as miserable.” He paused for a few moments to take a long drink of water.    
  
“Kenton was the polar opposite, he was always so happy, always so kind. He loved everyone, no exceptions. He loved Eliza the most though, I just don't know why. She’d scream in his face and he’d just smile; beg for his money and he’d give her twice what she wanted. I don’t understand why. Why could he love her, yet I was unable to?” His eyes were so empty, so devoid of live. In all my years as a phycologist I'd never seen a child so filled with apathy.    
  
“Jacob, what happened to Kenton?” It was time, time to finally hear the truth to Kenton Madden’s death. “The police department reported three separate calls claiming to hear immense screaming. What happened Jacob?” I asked him. He breathed in deeply before responding.   
  
“I received another letter. It had two papers. ‘Would you be so kind as to eat your brother's heart for me.’ It asked me to eat his heart, to kill him. I loved him more than anyone, I really did, he was my baby brother, and I was supposed to protect him, and-” he stopped. “The second paper was blank except for a jumble of letters and a Https link, which when I typed it into my laptop brought me to a site called Pete’s Perfect Pickling.” A sick feeling ran through my veins at the way he said it. “It had only four videos, parts one through four.”   
  
 He held up four fingers.   
  
 “Examine and clean the produce.”   
  
 Three fingers.    
  
“Cut up the produce into little pieces.”    
  
Two fingers.    
  
 “Package the produce”    
  
One finger.   
  
“Show Jacob his new little sister.”    
  
He looked up a me, his eyes boring into mine with a grim ferocity. “It knew my name. They made it for me.”   
  
I think I knew what he was about to say, but I needed to ask anyway. “Jacob, what did you see in the videos?”   
  
“Eliza. I saw Eliza. Two people wearing hoods dragged her into a frame. I couldn't see much of the room but it was a small, and dirty, with a table in the middle. They chained her to it and just started scrubbing away; and I don’t mean like with some cloth or rags, no I mean they were using steel wool and sandpaper. She was just a kid, but every time they found a dimple or zit, or any imperfection they’d scrub it away till the skin began to peel off in big bleeding chunks. She screamed so goddamn much, but didn’t utter a single legible word. That was the first video, the second video was worse. So much worse.”    
  
He lay back in his chair staring up into the ceiling. I could hear his voice as it cracked. “They cut her up. They sliced off her fingers, and toes, and legs, and arms, and ears, and nose, and eyes, and skin, and.... I can't get her screams out of my head! She didn’t say a word because she didn't have a tongue to form words with! She just screamed, even when she should have died from blood lose, she still screamed,” He lowered his head and looked at me once again in the eye, and something in his made the hairs on my back rise up. "You should know by now what happens when I don’t obey the letters.” His mouth formed a sickening grin as he spoke.   
  
“Jacob they weren't real, the police never found any evidence of any letters, or pictures, and this Pete’s Pickling doesn’t exist. It was all-”    
  
“THEY WERE REAL! Each and every one of those letters were real, I held them, I read them, and I saw what happened when I disobeyed them. You want to know why cut open my brother? Because whatever part of me that understood that Eliza was my sister wouldn't let those videos play out. Want to know what the last video was? I'll tell you. It showed rows upon rows of pickling jars filled with little pieces of her! A finger here, a kidney there, her toes all lined up nicely in sealed jars. And right in front so I couldn't miss it was her eyes! Two blue eyes drenched in vinegar, and they were looking at me! Her eyes still watched me and her toes still wiggled around, and her tongue wouldn't stop scraping the edge of its jar like it was trying to form words. She was alive stuffed into hundreds of little jars and I saw every last one of them. There was no choice for me. I took a knife and cut open Kenton's ribcage and ate his heart because I couldn't let the alternative happen.” Tears fell down his face, but his eyes weren't filled with sorrow, but rage.    
  
“Everyone keeps judging me as if I relished in his death, as if I wanted it. But you want to know the truth? Not one of you white collared bastards would have lifted a finger to help her, you all would have let Eliza be ripped apart. I did what you all could never do! You all are COWARDS to afraid to dirty your hands to protect someone. In a triage doctors decide whose life is sacrificed in order for others to live, but when I spare a child from being chopped up and jammed into glass tubs, I’m the monster?” I signaled the guards as he began to tug on his handcuffs. “I loved him! I loved my brother more than my own life, and I gave him up so SHE could live! I did what he would have wanted and all I'm left with are nightmares of him cursing my name as I kill him. I can't unsee the betrayal in his eyes and every time I try to sleep, I hear Eliza’s agonized screams.” He lay back into his chair and began to cry as the guards circled around him.    
  
“It should have been me. I should have died. It should be me that is contorted into unrecognized shapes. It should be me who has their heart eaten. It should be me who's chopped up into tiny pieces and stuffed into glass jars. I hated my baby sister so much that I would pray that she would just up and die, or be even be ran over by a drunk driver on her way to school.” The guards began to take him away; I could clearly see he was in no way up to more questions. As he left, he said one last thing.   
  
“You know, I realized something. I had no reason to hate Eliza, none, she was barely ten and I hated her with so much passion. The fact that we share a last name should make her puck in disgust because of what a pathetic excuse of a human I turned out to be.”     
  
In the end it didn’t matter if he was lying or if he actually believed what he said; he admitted to killing his brother and due to the violent nature of the crime the judge sentenced him to five years in a mental rehibition facility. If after his stay they no longer deemed him dangerous to himself or others, he would be sent to prison for ten more years. Compared to how many people he killed and how they were found, he received a rather lenient punishment.   
  
The last time I saw Jacob Madden was in that inspection room. When I heard his story I thought it was the ravings of an insane child, and I declared it as such. Now though, not so much. You have to understand that the only reason I'm writing this down and sharing it is because this morning, when I went to walk my dog, I found a letter in my mailbox. The letter was from a company by the name of Pete’s Perfect Pickling. Inside it was a piece of paper, and written in stylized font was this instruction. ‘Would you be so kind as to kill your neighbor's cat?’
