Room 214 had been empty for years, but every night, I heard the knocking.



I was new to the job, just another night manager at the old, decaying hotel on the edge of town. The place had a reputation—guests rarely stayed longer than a night, and the staff never lasted more than a few months. The stories of haunted rooms and vengeful spirits were just that—stories. Or so I thought.



On my first night, the knocking started. It was faint, almost inaudible over the hum of the ancient boiler in the basement, but it was there. Tap, tap, tap. It came from Room 214, the room that was always listed as "Out of Service" in the hotel's logbook.



I tried to ignore it at first, chalking it up to the creaks and groans of an old building. But as the night wore on, the sound became more insistent, each knock seeming to echo louder than the last. Tap, tap, tap. It was as if someone—or something—was trying to get out. Or in.



Curiosity, or maybe something darker, got the better of me. I took the rusted key labeled "214" from behind the desk and made my way up the creaking stairs. The hallway on the second floor was dimly lit, the wallpaper peeling, revealing layers of neglect. Each step I took echoed like a death rattle in the silence. I could feel the weight of the building's history pressing down on me, making the air thick and hard to breathe.



When I reached the door to Room 214, I saw that it was slightly ajar. A cold shiver ran down my spine as I approached. The knocking had stopped the moment I turned the corner, as if whatever was inside knew I was coming. I hesitated, my hand hovering over the doorknob. But the silence was worse than the knocking. I needed to know what was inside.



I pushed the door open, the old hinges groaning in protest. The room was exactly as I'd imagined—dust-covered furniture, a sagging bed, and the scent of mildew thick in the air. It looked like it hadn't been touched in years, maybe decades. But something was off. The room felt wrong, like it was holding its breath, waiting for something.



The only thing out of place was the old rotary phone on the nightstand. It was off the hook, the receiver dangling from its cord, swaying gently as if it had just been disturbed. My heart pounded in my chest as I crossed the room to pick it up. I told myself it was nothing, just an old phone knocked loose by a draft. But when I lifted the receiver to my ear, I heard a sound that froze my blood.



“Help me…” The voice was faint, barely more than a whisper, but it was there. It was desperate, pleading, and filled with a terror that I could feel in my bones. My hand shook as I dropped the receiver, the phone clattering to the floor.



I backed away, my mind racing. There had to be an explanation. Maybe it was a prank, or maybe the isolation and the late hour were playing tricks on me. But before I could collect my thoughts, the door behind me slammed shut with a force that rattled the walls. I spun around, my breath catching in my throat.



The room was suddenly colder, the shadows deeper. It felt like the walls were closing in, the space shrinking around me. Panic surged through me as I reached for the door, but it wouldn't budge. I was trapped.



The knocking resumed, louder this time, coming from all around me—the walls, the ceiling, the floor. It was relentless, pounding in my ears, drowning out my thoughts. I screamed, but the sound was swallowed by the noise. The walls seemed to pulse with each knock, inching closer, squeezing the air from the room.



In the midst of the chaos, I heard the voice again, clearer this time. “Help me… please…” It was coming from the walls, as if someone was trapped inside them, desperate to get out.



I pounded on the door, shouting for help, but no one came. The knocking grew louder, more frantic, until it was all I could hear. I felt the room closing in, the walls pressing against me, the cold seeping into my bones.



Then, just as suddenly as it started, the knocking stopped. The silence was deafening. I stood frozen, my back against the door, my heart hammering in my chest. The room was still, but I could feel something watching me, something waiting.



I reached for the door again, and this time, it opened easily. I stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for breath. The air outside the room was warmer, lighter, as if I had escaped from a nightmare. But I could still hear the echo of the voice in my head, pleading, desperate.



I locked the door to Room 214 and ran back downstairs, leaving the key behind the desk. I didn't care what the others said about the room. I knew what I had heard, what I had felt. I never went near Room 214 again, but every night, as I sat alone at the front desk, I could still hear the faint, rhythmic tapping coming from the second floor. Tap, tap, tap.



And every night, I wondered who, or what, was trapped inside that room, waiting for someone to finally listen.
