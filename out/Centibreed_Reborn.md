It was fall, and the weather was perfect for hiking. At least, Mark thought so. Hannah, his girlfriend of three years, not so much. The golden leaves falling through the warm afternoon sun were beautiful, but she hated every other aspect that came with traipsing through the forest. Especially bugs.

“How much further, Mark?”

“Not much.” Mark grinned, holding up a branch for Hannah to pass under. “It'll be worth it, I promise.”

Even Hannah's clear annoyance couldn't wipe the endearing smile from Mark's face. She had to smirk.

“Come on. We're almost there,” Mark said, plucking a leaf from her hair as he jogged past.

Shadows soon covered the forest floor as the sounds of dusk rose. Only a glimmer of soft orange remained to show the way. Mark was almost giddy as they neared a clearing. The trees thinned, and Hannah gasped.

“Yeah.” Mark bowed and waved a hand, “M’lady, if you would accompany me.”

A small creek babbled on the far side of the clearing. The sun—nearly set now—glimmered on the surface like golden specs. Their path crossed directly over, Mark helping Hannah splash over the wet rocks. Obscured at first by trees, a small, rocky hill appeared.

Several massive pine trees rose above a collapsed campfire. Fallen logs lined the site, the remaining light flashing like fireflies through its limbs. Mark wrapped an arm around Hannah and pulled her close.

Mark dropped his pack next to the old fire pit and knelt down to set up camp. Hannah, still marveling at the serene beauty of the spot, reluctantly took a seat on one of the fallen logs. The chilly evening air was beginning to set in, causing her to pull her jacket tighter around her body.

“This place is amazing,” she admitted, unable to suppress a smile as she watched Mark work.

“See? Told you it’d be worth it,” Mark replied, flashing her a triumphant grin.

As he started building a fire, Hannah shifted uncomfortably. She could feel the creeping sensation of insects scurrying across her skin, and she slapped at her arms, shuddering.

“Do you think there are... you know, like, dangerous bugs out here?” she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.

“Nah, nothing more dangerous than a mosquito bite,” Mark said, though his eyes darted towards the surrounding forest for just a moment.

The fire crackled to life, casting flickering shadows that danced around them. They spent the evening roasting marshmallows and sharing stories, the warmth of the fire keeping the growing cold at bay. As the stars dotted the night sky, Mark reached into his pack and pulled out a small box.

“Hannah,” he began, his voice trembling slightly. “I know you hate bugs and hiking, but you’ve always been willing to put up with it for me. I love you for that and so much more. Will you marry me?”

Tears welled up in Hannah’s eyes as she looked at the ring, the firelight reflecting off the diamond. “Yes, Mark! Of course, I will!”

They embraced, and as the night grew colder, they found warmth in each other’s arms, the forest around them forgotten in their shared joy.

In the dead of night, Hannah woke with a start, a sharp pain radiating from her ankle. She winced, trying not to wake Mark as she fumbled for a flashlight. She directed the beam to her foot and saw a small, but deep, puncture wound, with a large centipede quickly scurrying away into the darkness.

“Mark... wake up,” she whispered, shaking his shoulder. “Something bit me.”

Groggy and disoriented, Mark rubbed his eyes and looked at the wound. “It’s probably just a spider bite. We’ll get it checked out in the morning.”

Hannah tried to relax, but the pain was growing, spreading up her leg in relentless waves. As dawn broke, they packed up hastily, Mark practically carrying her back to the car.

By the time they reached the nearest hospital, Hannah’s condition had worsened dramatically. Her skin was pale and clammy, and she was barely conscious. Doctors rushed her into the emergency room, leaving Mark in the waiting area, his mind racing with worry.

Hours passed with no word. Mark paced the sterile, fluorescent-lit hallway, his heart pounding in his chest. Finally, a doctor emerged, her face grave.

“She’s in critical condition. There’s some kind of parasite we’ve never seen before. We’re doing everything we can.”

Mark’s blood ran cold. “A parasite? What do you mean?”

The doctor hesitated. “It’s... growing inside her, very rapidly. We need to operate immediately.”

The next hours were a blur of anxiety and dread. Mark’s hands shook as he waited, the hospital’s emergency broadcast system flickering on screens around him, warning of a potential outbreak.

Then, a blood-curdling scream echoed through the corridors. Nurses and doctors sprinted past him, shouting orders. Mark followed, his legs feeling like lead. He burst into Hannah’s room just in time to see her body convulse violently on the operating table.

In a grotesque explosion of blood and tissue, a massive centipede tore free from her abdomen, its segmented body thrashing wildly. Mark could only watch in horror as thousands of tiny, grotesque centipede-human hybrids poured from the remains of Hannah’s body, swarming over the medical staff, their screams mingling with the sound of scuttling legs.

Mark stumbled back, his mind reeling. The creatures spread with terrifying speed, their numbers multiplying as they infected every living being in their path. Panic surged through the hospital, and Mark found himself alone in the room where Hannah had died, the walls and floor slick with her blood.

The emergency broadcast on the TV announced the rapid spread of the infestation, cities falling one by one. Mark could barely process the words as he stared at the carnage around him.

Then, the TV flickered, and the emergency broadcast cut to a live feed. A reporter, standing amidst chaos, was suddenly grabbed by a monstrous centipede. As the creature ripped the reporter apart on live television, it turned to the camera. A strip of Hannah’s face still clung to its mandibles, and in a perfect mimicry of her voice, it spoke.

“I did it all for you, my love. I did it all for us."
