Before you continue reading this, keep in mind that the last time I wrote anything was in eighth grade. Never in my life after that did I bother to pick up a pen and write something down again.

Hi. I’m Dhriti Chawla.
For the past two years, I have been frantically searching for an escape. It wasn’t until half a month ago that I finally accessed the internet, and the first place I could think of was Reddit. I’ll try my best to explain the situation at hand.

I have been working at Error Meridian for the past two years or rather, I’ve been stuck in this God-knows-how-many-storeys-long apartment building. I was never properly informed about my job or the actual work I was expected to do. That alone should have been the biggest red flag, but two years ago, I wasn’t the Dhriti I am today.

6th of May, 2023, is a date forever etched into my mind. My mother died that day in a car accident.
I was left alone. My father had died decades ago, so I was sent to live with my Chachu, Chachi, and their two sons. They resented me, partly because I was a girl, and partly because I was a moody teenager, impulsive and difficult. 

My mother’s death affected me more deeply than I had expected. She wasn’t the best mother, and I wasn’t the best daughter. We never had a good relationship. But she was all I had in the shabby building we lived in.

My Chachi had always hated my mother and me. She never missed a chance to mock my mother for not being able to bear a son. I wish my mother had siblings. Maybe they would’ve treated me like a human being.
Instead, I got a new roof over my head, and my Chachi got a new cleaner, babysitter, and target for slut-shaming.

She didn’t let me leave the house. I was stopped from going to school, from meeting my friends, and even from seeing my boyfriend.

Speaking of my boyfriend, Chachi gave me beautiful red welts on my already scarred face when she caught me on a phone call with him. She was more aggravated by the fact that I had a boyfriend than by the lit cigarette between my fingers.

I hadn’t always been a smoker. Chachu was, a chronic one. I stole a pack from him, hoping the cigarettes would help me cope with my mother’s death. In hindsight, I should’ve gone for his beer bottles instead.

That night, Atul, my boyfriend kept spamming my phone. My Chachi had it. A few more welts followed, and this time, blood trickled down my face.

Atul showed up at the house later that night.

Everyone had warned me not to date him. There was a significant age gap. He was rumored to be a drug dealer and a local criminal. All he ever expected from me was sex, and honestly, back then, I just liked the attention. Not that we ever had sex, most of our “dates” were just him trying to convince me to lie down with him.

The rumors turned out to be true.

Atul arrived that night heavily drugged and looking for a fight.

Being the coward I was, I locked myself in the bathroom. I pressed my ear against the cold tile, my cheek still burning where Chachi had struck me earlier.

He was screaming.
Chachi was watching a soap opera when she opened the door for him. I remember that part clearly, because the laugh track kept echoing in my head long after the screaming began. She mocked him, laughed at his slurred speech, at the way he swayed. She didn’t realize how drugged he was.

The television went silent.
I pressed my ear harder against the wall. I heard choking, wet, desperate sounds, then a heavy thud. Then another. Voices gathered outside. Someone screamed. The children woke up. 

Chachu returned from the vegetable market minutes later. He saw people crowded near the apartment, whispering, crying. Confused, he pushed through them until his worn out chappals sank into something warm.
Blood.
He ran inside.

Atul was standing over his son’s body, his hands shaking as he squeezed his neck. Chachi lay in the doorway beside their other son, their eyes wide open, glassy, staring at the ceiling.
Chachu didn’t even have time to scream.

Atul saw him, reached into his jacket, and fired once. The sound cracked through the apartment loud enough for the apartment noise to go silent for minutes.

I stayed curled up on the bathroom floor, my hands pressed over my mouth. I bit down on my skin until I tasted blood. I don’t remember breathing. I don’t remember crying. I only remember waiting.

The police arrived an hour later. By then, Atul had collapsed, unconscious from whatever he had taken.

They pulled me out of the bathroom, wrapped a shawl around my shoulders, and asked me questions I barely understood. I answered. Soon after, I was allowed to leave.

What happened to Atul after that, I don’t know. Maybe he’s in prison. Maybe he’s still free, looking for another girl to manipulate. I try not to think about it.

I was left with nothing. No relatives. No job. I didn’t even get to complete my education.
What job could I possibly get?
I muttered the question to myself as I scrubbed the floor for the last time. Blood stains are stubborn.

I couldn’t stay in that apartment for more than a week. Rent was due. I had no money. No plan.
As I wiped the floor, I noticed something strange. The rag in my hand wasn’t stained anymore, not even faintly.
I forced myself to ignore it.

In the kitchen, I stacked the dishes and counted the mugs. Too many were missing.
Did Atul take them?
The thought was ridiculous. I told myself I needed therapy. Or at least someone to talk to.
Or maybe just a glass of water.
