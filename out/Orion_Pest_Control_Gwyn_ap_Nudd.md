[Samhain Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/vzg8vands3)

The Dead Duo had a far worse time of it than we did. To put it simply, Victor had met us at the bonfire alone. 

I'll get into what happened to Wes in a minute. Sorry to leave yinz in suspense, but this account of events is all second-hand. To spare us all some confusion, let me start at the beginning of their night. 

(If you're not familiar with what Orion Pest Control's services are, it may help to start [here.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/OpNHnxiz8U)

The first time that they'd heard the howls of the Cŵn Annwn, the otherworldly hounds had sounded far off. During their initial trek into the woods, the black birds continued to haunt their steps, chattering to each other as they shadowed the two undead men. 

However, our coworkers didn't have this unwelcome entourage for long. 

They didn't see the owl, at first. A crow screeched, then its cry was abruptly cut off. The other crows began to chatter in outrage. 

Victor saw the owl soaring away with one of the Hunt's crows trapped firmly in its talons. It was the very same brown screech owl that had been watching us load up the barn with supplies. It had even brought friends, the ranks of which included other birds of prey that dove furiously at the Wild Hunt’s crows as if they had a vendetta against them. 

Wes and him exchanged a look. 

“Friends of yours?” Victor questioned, only half joking. 

Wes shrugged, “I was going to ask you the same thing.”

Since the owl and its buddies were keeping the lesser Hunters off of their backs, Vic opted just to keep moving without questioning that odd experience further. They could find some way to thank the birds at a later date, preferably when they weren't about to be hunted for sport. 

The Dead Duo didn't waste any time once they got to the barn, swiftly pulling out their supplies to start securing the doors. Salt lines were drawn across the thresholds of every entry point, including windows. I guess the boss hurt himself with it, in his haste. Wouldn't be the first time. Occupational hazard for a draugr.  

During our initial preparations, one of the three extra hagstones had been hung from the rafters. It may sound like a questionable location for a stone, but the Hunters *can* fly, after all. Meanwhile, the Dead Duo kept the remaining two stones on them. They were as ready as they could be. At least, that’s what Victor had thought at the time. 

Roughly an hour after they finished setting up, there was a round of hooting and hollering from the hounds. Victor knew in his gut that their chorus meant that the Hunters had found one of the ‘appetizers’ the mechanic had mentioned. 

After the fact, we found out that both victims were registered sex offenders. Something I'd never thought about until Victor brought it up is that the registry provides full names. The boss explained that it’s a useful tool for the Hunters, chock full of the exact types of souls they prefer to torture the most. To quote Iolo, *‘The types no one’ll miss.’*

Up until that point, the Dead Duo had been killing time with chitchat. But after the second ‘appetizer’ had been caught, all conversation died. Victor was on high alert, listening to every breeze, every creak of the trees, every murmur of the forest. Waiting. Meanwhile, Wes still seemed fairly excited as he kept glancing through the windows to see if anything was coming. 

Occasionally, they'd hear the crows call as they passed the barn by. The owl attack had thrown the lessers off, buying the Dead Duo a good deal of time before shit hit the fan. 

Another hour passed. They continued to wait. Wes had begun to pace from pent-up energy. They hadn't heard any hounds or crows for a while. Where were they? There was still time before sunrise. 

There was a soft scuffing sound outside. Wes' pacing stopped, having heard it, too. There it was again, but higher off the ground. 

The roof. Something was on the roof. 

Victor didn't hesitate. He took aim and shot at whatever was climbing on top of the barn. 

They heard laughter outside from multiple sources, followed by Briar's voice from above, mocking, “I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty!”

Thorns began to slither along the top of the barn, their serpentine movements stopping abruptly as they neared the hagstone on the rafters. Putting it there was a good call. The vines were unable to pass it. 

Victor fired again into the gathering of thorns, blasting some of them off. 

They heard the mechanic's voice then, taunting Wes, “You gonna hide in there all night, boy?”

To Victor's chagrin, our coworker didn't hesitate to shout in reply, “*Just you!*”

His response was met with more laughter along with some Gaelic spoken amongst their pursuers. Not surprising that the merry band of **jagoffs** would take the challenge as a joke.  

Victor glanced up to see that Briar was standing above the hole in the roof in all of his winged glory, head tilted curiously. The thorns writhed against the ceiling, testing the limits of the hagstone on the rafters. 

“Don't go out there,” Victor warned. 

Unfortunately, Wes wasn't listening, “If I meet you out there, I'm only dealing with you. Hear me, Dragonfly? No interference from anyone else. One-on-one. Just you.”

There was a moment of consideration before the mechanic replied casually, “Yeah, I got some time to kill. It'll be a while ‘til the White Son of Mist finishes up.”

That had instantly rang alarm bells in Victor's head. *Finishes what?* He'd worried that meant that the king of the Wild Hunt had turned his attention to someone else. Namely, Reyna, Cerri, or I. 

Victor tried to warn his employee again. “Don't-”

“Oh, be quiet.” Briar cut him off dismissively, “He wanted this, didn't he?”

Without another word, Wes marched out to face the mechanic, salt-covered cutlass drawn. 

The boss stepped forward to follow, but stopped once he heard more scuffling from above him. He turned to see that Briar now clung to the barn's ceiling by the hooks in his wings. 

“You don't mess with the fight, neither will we.” The Hunter told him lightly. “All's fair, right?”

Was it, though? Was it *really* fair, Briar?

~~It's probably a good thing I wasn't there to piss the Hunters off more.~~

“Sure.” Victor snapped curtly. “This the thanks we get for helping you with the hag?”

Briar scoffed, “Come on, draugr. I know you don't like us, but you know us better than that! At least, you *should,* by now.”

The Hunter had found a spot on the rafters that was just outside of the hagstone's influence to perch on, thorn-covered antlers brushing the ceiling. 

He continued, “We let you set up this little safe house without making a move to sabotage it. You really think we didn't know what you were up to? Hell, I'm even going the extra mile and taking the liberty to make sure that none of our guests get the idea to weasel their way in here. We're being *far* kinder to you than we have ever been to any others. And you didn't even notice. Have to say, it's kind of hurtful.”

Victor stole a line from Reyna: “Cope.”

When he told me that, I let out the *ugliest* snort. Clearly, the boss was done giving a shit. And he didn't have many of those left to begin with. 

Briar just shook his head, “You Orion fuckers really have forgotten how to keep your attitudes in check, haven't you?”

Victor ignored that comment, “Won't your boss have some choice things to say about you helping me?”

Briar chuckled, “Who do you think is the one that okayed this?”

Okay. That's interesting. But one semi-good deed on the mechanic's part isn't much compared to his laundry list of war crimes. 

Thankfully, none of the other Hunters appeared to have any interest in entering the barn now that Wes had come out. He was their primary target. Briar’s influence probably didn’t hurt either, as begrudging as I am to give him so much credit. 

To Victor's horror, he then saw that Wes had left his hagstone hanging on a hook by the door. The reason for this was most likely that he wouldn't have been able to get close enough to the mechanic to try to stab him without the stone repelling him. Victor swore to rip him a new one for taking that risk later.  

Keeping the shotgun trained on the thorned Hunter, Victor glanced out the window to see what was going on between his employee and our least favorite psychopomp. According to him, the pair were moving around each other so quickly that it was hard to keep track of them. He'd occasionally catch a glimpse of Iolo's wings or spikes glittering in the darkness, or the reflective Orion Pest Control logo on the back of Wes’ jacket. 

“Your boy is doing better than I thought.” Briar commented, swinging one furry leg absent-mindedly. “I should've brought popcorn.”

“I am very selective about who I hire,” the boss informed him. “You think I'd bring on just anyone off the street? *You* should know *me* better, Briar.”

Briar sighed heavily, clearly not happy with Vic sassing him yet again, but conceded with a shrug of his shoulder, “Yeah. You got me there.”

That's when he heard the mechanic whoop from outside, “*Hoo!* Yup, that's salt!”

To Victor's disappointment, he sounded more surprised than hurt. 

The dueling pair had slowed down a bit, circling each other in front of their audience of antlers, growling dogs, and black birds. The mechanic had his banjo strapped to his back, ready to use if he got bored of his wooden sword.

As an aside, I wonder if he'd sharpened the blade up before Halloween. That training sword was a bit dull in our sessions. Of course, I could also see Iolo liking the idea of slowly killing Orion's vampire with a dull sword.  

“You know what you're doin’, boy, I'll give ya that!” The mechanic said, rolling his bad shoulder, a subtle edge to his voice that made Victor think that he wasn't being entirely sincere. “Here I was, thinkin’ I'd be humblin’ some half-cocked lil’ shithead. Gotta say, I'm pleasantly surprised.”

At first, Vic thought that Wes had gotten hit at some point, since his mouth was covered in blood, but then he noticed that Iolo nonchalantly wiped at a gash on his shoulder. Wes had actually managed to take a bite out of Iolo. Along with that, the base of the mechanic's prosthetic wings were bleeding, most likely from forcing the Huntsman to push himself before they'd fully healed.

He remembered thinking that they might actually be able to pull it off. That they might actually have a chance against the Wild Hunt.

“I'm a bit rusty,” Wes told Iolo with a vicious smile. “It's been a while since I've had a real fight.”

“That why ya volunteered?” Iolo asked, as if they were merely making friendly smalltalk. 

“Partially.”

A new voice spoke then. One Victor had never heard before, deep and gravelly, “Are you planning on toying with the poor thing all night?”

Every Hunter's head turned towards the speaker, including Iolo. The ones watching the fight had bowed deeply, including the Cŵn Annwn, their red ears back against their heads as their backs arched. 

The White Son of Mist had arrived. 

From Victor's description, the king of the Wild Hunt was equally as magnificent as he was frightening. Great antlers like that of an elk stood from his scalp, adorned with shining crystals that reminded him of icicles. Some of those icy gems were braided into Gwyn’s auburn hair. Smokey, ink-black skin surrounded the king's featureless white eyes and the bridge of his nose like a mask, the ornamentation accented with additional black lines beneath the corners of his mouth. Unlike his followers, the rest of his anatomy was humanoid. No hooves, fur, or wings. 

Victor had said he'd expected an ancient god to dress in finery. But instead, the king of the Wild Hunt was clothed in regular, practical outdoor wear, at odds with his intricate braids and crystal embellishments.

The mechanic bowed his head respectfully at the king, replying, “I was waitin’ on you, sir.”

The White Son of Mist grinned coldly, crouching down, resting his elbows on his knees as those white eyes fixed on Wes, “I'm here, now.”

That was when shit got real for the Dead Duo. 

The mechanic had gone after Wes with renewed ferocity, the vampire unable to do much more than defend himself against the onslaught. It was hard to see exactly how bad it was, between their speed and the darkness. When Victor heard the audience of Hunters cheer, his heart sank. 

He knew that if he tried to get involved, that would only make things worse for our coworker. That'd give one of the other Hunters a pass to intervene as well. Even so, there had to be some way around that. There always was. He just had to find it. 

He'd slyly glanced at Briar from the corner of his eye. The Hunter was watching him intently, chin resting on his fist, daring the boss to make a move. 

*‘I've heard many things about you.’*

The voice hadn't spoken aloud. It was a whisper in the back of Victor's consciousness. He tensed up, knowing that he hadn't imagined it.

*‘You and your colleagues don't disappoint. This has been a most special Calan Gaeaf.’*

It was then that Victor had learned the hard way that there was a huge difference between a god that still had his divinity intact and a Wild Huntsman. When Victor glanced out the window again, he saw that Gwyn’s gaze was still firmly fixed on the fight. Unlike his followers, the White Son of Mist didn't have to look the boss in the eyes to get into his head. And the hagstone had done absolutely nothing to protect him. 

*‘Your life was cut short. Too short.’*

As Victor recounted this to me, he unconsciously put a hand on his bandana. 

The god had made him experience the knife cutting into his throat once again, his own hot blood rushing into his airway, unable to cough enough of it up. He woke up in his murderer's trunk. Tasted his killer's flesh. His body was wracked with heroin withdrawals while his father's voice told him he couldn't help him anymore. 

Then just quickly as it had happened, he was back in the barn again. At some point, he'd fallen to his knees, the shotgun on the ground in front of him.

*‘I don't intend to cut it short once again. That would be a waste. Wouldn't you agree?’*

Victor dared to whisper, “What do you want?”

*‘You've already given it to me.’*

There was another uproarious cry from the audience of jeering Hunters. Victor pulled himself back up to the window to see that Iolo had gotten Wes on his back, tearing our coworker's throat out with those horrible teeth. 

He paused to spit Wes’ own blood back into his face, growling, “See how you like it!”

There is a selfish part of me that is glad I'd missed that. I've seen Iolo pissed before, but never to the point of going semi-feral. I've decided that it's something I'd never like to bear witness to. 

In response, Wes dug his fingers into the weak spot at the base of Iolo's prosthetic wings. 

When he saw that, Victor had rushed for the door, certain that Iolo was going to rip Wes’ head off until something huge and furry knocked the furious Huntsman off of him. As Wes scrambled to his feet, the boss could see that the mechanic had taken such a big chunk out of our colleague that the ridges of his windpipe were exposed. 

Wes’ savior had been a black bear. 

It positioned himself between the mechanic and Wes, protectively baring its teeth at the Huntsman. In the forest surrounding them, there was commotion from the other Hunters as coyotes yipped at the Cŵn Annwn. Trees groaned deeply, as if speaking to one another. From a tall cedar, the brown owl that had protected them from the crows’ prying eyes watched intently. 

Of all things to happen that night, the False Tree coming to their rescue was not on *any* of our bingo cards, especially since the barn wasn't located anywhere near its territory. 

The last time we'd seen it, it had told us, ‘The forest will remember your kindness.’ I guess this is what the False Tree had meant. 

Iolo savagely spat more of Wes’ blood onto the ground before calmly telling the snarling animal, “Don't forget. We helped you, too.”

One of the Hunters tried to sneak up on the agitated bear. Before he could strike, Iolo seized his arm, digging his claws into the Hunter’s skin until his subordinate dropped his weapon. He kept squeezing, not stopping until the Hunter crumpled to his knees. 

Using the fallen Hunter’s bare shoulder to wipe the blood from his fingers, Iolo then turned his head towards the rest of them, announcing coldly, “Don't let me catch *any* o’ you tryin’ *anything* with these here animals. I don't give a flyin’ fuck if they bite ya where the sun don't shine, ya don't touch ‘em. Understood?”

The army of assholes confirmed that they understood. 

Once again, the White Son of Mist's voice was in the back of Victor's mind, the tone patronizing, *‘The Shepherd of the Forest wishes to aid you. The sun is due to rise in an hour. You’ve gained quite a few luxuries in a short amount of time. Yet, the same question remains: do you think your friend can make it?’*

Looking at the state Wes was in, Victor wasn't sure. Our coworker was putting on a brave face, but the boss could tell that he was hurting. And he was fairly confident that Iolo and Gwyn were just as aware of this as he was. 

“Only one way to find out.” The boss grumbled before marching to the door. 

That time, Briar made no move to stop him, shaking his head at the mechanic, “I told him to take it easy...”

The bear kept Wes and Iolo separated like a big furry referee. The mechanic circled, angered enough to ignore the blood dripping down his back. I guess his teeth were also stained red. His prosthetic wings drooped. 

The mechanic had stiffened when Victor came out, his head following the boss like a cat watching an interesting insect. He appeared to be barely holding himself back from going after Orion's manager. Without a word, he removed that damned banjo from his back. 

Vic had expected him to start playing, but The White Son of Mist placed a hand on the mechanic's good shoulder, whispering something that Victor couldn't hear. Whatever it was, it made Iolo visibly relax. However, he still watched every move the Orion employees made. The boss could feel Iolo's gaze crawling along his spine as he guided Wes back into the barn. 

Briar was still chilling on the rafters when the boss dragged our coworker inside. Though, Victor had reluctantly said he couldn't complain about this too much since those thorns were the only things keeping the other Hunters from entering the barn from above. That had been Briar's way of repaying his debt to Orion for not letting the hag cook him to death.

It's harrowing to think about. If we hadn't had all these favors that we'd collected, the Dead Duo would've been completely fucked. Far more than we'd anticipated. In hindsight, all of our other preparations seem almost silly. How could we have thought that hagstones and salt would be enough to withstand the wrath of a literal god and his legion of sadists?

In a worse timeline, Orion Pest Control was violently wiped off the face of the earth on Halloween night. We've heard of it happening to other specialty pest control companies before. It's something we don't speak of often, like just mentioning it has the power to invoke that cruel fate. 

Wes leaned heavily against the wall, using its leverage to remain standing. His head was tilted to the side, inadvertently showing off what remained of his destroyed throat. The bear curled up next to him, watching the door, ears pricked. 

When he tried to speak, all that came out was a terrible gurgle. *God,* poor guy. 

“Don't talk,” The boss told him, clutching the shotgun as he guarded the window. “Just try not to die on me.”

Wes gave him a thumbs up. 

There was scraping from above as the thorns began to recede from the hole in the roof. Cautiously, Victor made Wes take his hagstone back. 

That was when Briar finally spoke again, “I need to go check on my superior, seeing as your boy screwed up his wings again. Oh, and just a head's up: they're about to tear this place down. I suggest you two start running.”

Victor swore, then rushed over to grab Wes with his free hand, pulling our injured coworker towards the sliding doors on the other side of the barn. Once he was certain that Wes wasn't going to keel over the instant he let go, he pressed his shoulder against the heavy sliding door to push it open. 

The bear bounded out ahead of them once the enormous door cracked open enough for it to squeeze through. The animal let out a blood-curdling roar at the Hunters waiting outside, its yellow fangs exposed in a clear threat. 

They gracefully danced out of the way of its claws, making no move to retaliate against it. After the mechanic's harsh warning, they wouldn't dare. Even the Cŵn Annwn just shoved the foxes and coyotes nipping at their ears and heels away, keeping their own sharp teeth to themselves. 

They just had to stay near the bear. That seemed to be their best bet. It seemed to know where it was going.

Aa they followed their protector, Victor looked over his shoulder. White eyes in the darkness. The White Son of Mist was tailing them, hands in pockets. Victor half expected the god to start whistling or humming, that's how casually contented he looked. 

*Stay near the bear.* 

But would the king honor the mechanic's sentimentality towards the False Tree? Victor didn't want to find out the hard way. 

Slowly, Wes seemed to be recovering from the bite. *Very* slowly. 

He was at least to the point where some of his vocal chords were working again. He whispered jokingly to Vic, his voice hoarse, “Can't say I've ever had a giant bug almost bite my head off before. That's a new one.” 

Despite their circumstances, Victor managed a snort, “You're the one that wanted to fight him.”

“Worth it.”

“Was it really?”

“Absolutely. Sure, I got a little fucked up, but I got to hurt his precious wings. And if you're curious, his blood tastes like cherries.”

Victor offered him a wry smile, “I wasn't curious, but thanks for telling me anyway.”

“No problem!”

There was a terrible crash behind them. The barn. When Victor checked over his shoulder again, he saw that Briar hadn't been exaggerating. There was a flurry of wings and antlers as their only safe spot was reduced to splinters. As that went on, more commotion could be heard from both the Wild Hunt and the False Tree's animals as they brawled.

Suffice to say, that False Tree is going to get an offering fit for a god as thanks for what it did for Orion that night. 

However, speaking of gods, there was one thing even the False Tree couldn't protect them against: Gwyn ap Nudd. And Victor had lost sight of him. 

“How are you feeling?” He asked Wes warily, glancing around for any sign of the king. 

“I'm fantastic, how are you?” Wes rasped. 

“Don't be a smartass. Can you move on your own or not?”

“Yeah. Sorry.”

The boss let go of his shoulder, wanting to have both hands available for when the White Son of Mist showed himself again. 

When Victor was telling me this story, he suddenly stopped, closed his eyes, and frowned. 

“I can't remember exactly what happened.” He admitted. “The next thing I knew after I let him go, the bear was dragging Wes away by the arm. He wasn't moving. I was in the dirt, covered in claw marks. And the White Son of Mist was smiling down at me.”

While Victor was trying to figure out what the hell had just happened, he heard wings and footsteps from all directions, rushing after their quarry. He couldn't tell friend from foe. They all hurried in the same direction. 

All except for the king. He stayed where he was, eyes locked on the boss with a tight-lipped grin. Daring him to try something. 

Victor dared. 

He'd found the shotgun on the ground next to him, snatching it up and opening fire. The god didn't even blink as a hole was blown in his midsection. Just kept looking at Vic with that damned smile. 

This time, when Gwyn spoke, it wasn't in Victor's head, “You've been a real treat for me. I mean that, leader of Orion.”

He stepped forward. Victor fired again, despite knowing that it wouldn't do any good. It was merely for the principle of it. If the god of the Wild Hunt was going to torture him or use him to hurt Wes again, he at least wanted to make a stand before he had to endure whatever hell was in store for him. 

Once again, the White Son of Mist didn't appear to notice that he'd been shot. At least Iolo actually had the decency to get hurt whenever I'd blasted him with the salt shells.  

Victor scrambled to his feet, trying to encourage the god to continue chasing him. If Gwyn was focused on him, that meant that at least Wes would have only the rest of the hunting party to contend with. 

I say ‘only’ as if run-of-the-mill Hunters aren't also complete nightmares to deal with. But at least hagstones and salt can repel them. What can you do for a god?

“What do you want?” Victor asked again, still backing up as he struggled to reload with shaking hands. 

Gwyn merely kept approaching, ignoring the animals and Hunters rushing around as if it were just him and Victor in the woods that night. 

“What would it take for this to end?!” Victor questioned. He dropped the salt shell he'd been trying to load in. “*Fuck!*” 

A hand on his throat. The White Son of Mist lifted him off the ground as if he weighed nothing. He felt pressure in the middle of his back, then a piercing sensation deep within his chest that made him go limp. Dimly, he glanced down to see the sharp point of a tree limb sticking out of his chest, coated with his blood. 

His comparison made my teeth clench, “I was like a worm on a hook.”

“Weren’t you listening earlier?” The king replied, pulling down Victor's bandana, tracing his slit throat with a light finger. “You've proven to be everything my captain said you'd be. I want for nothing.”

Without Gwyn supporting his weight anymore, Victor had begun to feel gravity pulling him down. It felt like he was splitting in two. He weakly gripped the branch he was impaled on, trying to pull himself up to alleviate the sensation. By that point, he couldn't. Even with being undead, his strength had been stunted by the shock of it. 

When he told me that, I instantly started crying. He let me hug him, assuring me that it was his job as Orion's manager to take the brunt of the punishment, whether that was from shitty clients or shitty Neighbors. 

The White Son of Mist cast his gaze at the sky. It was turning green. Not quite sunrise yet. On our end, it was roughly the same time that the Dullahan had surrendered to get his head back. 

He then cupped Victor's cheek, forcing the boss to meet his white eyes as he said, “The next time I see you, I’ll be bringing the winter with me. It was a pleasure to *finally* meet you.”

He left Victor hanging from the tree. The boss didn't remember what happened after that. He ended up blacking out from the pain. 

Something hot and wet on his face. He came to on the ground, eyes opening to see a fox's orange snout in his face. It whined, continuing to lick him. He raised a hand, weakly scratching its ears. 

“Is my friend alive?” He asked it. 

The sound of something being dragged. The bear was back, gripping a dead deer by the antler with its teeth. Victor reluctantly admitted that his mouth had begun to water. The bear dropped the buck by Victor's side. 

“The man you protected,” Victor tried to ask again. “Where is he?”

In response, the bear nudged the deer closer with its snout, snorting. It stared the boss down. 

It wouldn’t lead him to Wes until he ate. Victor obliged it without further argument. 

Good news: Wes is alive. Or unalive. You know what I mean. However, he's avoiding Reyna, Cerri, and I for our own safety. The bear had fed him similarly to the way that it had Vic, but with how severe his injuries were, an animal sacrifice was just enough to give him the self control he needed to get home to his emergency blood supply. 

He'll be taking some time off to recover. I'd say he earned it. Likewise, we're trying to convince the boss to take a vacation. Victor definitely needs one. 

Samhain definitely could've gone worse for us. Wes, Vic, and I all got maimed a bit, but we survived, in no small part because of the aid from the False Tree. 

If yinz learn anything from what happened to us, let it be this: the forest never forgets. The Neighbors never forget. Your kindness will not go unnoticed. 

I’m sure some of you were hoping for some big, epic battle where we manage to vanquish the beings terrorizing us and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, this is real life, and in this line of work, survival *is* an epic victory. 

It’s like the boss always says: we’re not heroes, we’re pest control specialists. 

When I returned to Deirdre, she threw herself into my arms, having been anxious waiting for me all night. 

As much as I hated to do it, I'd asked her to stay behind. Not wanting me to have yet another thing to worry about, she'd agreed, albeit reluctantly. Though, she promised that if the river gave her any of our shirts, she’d rush over to the bonfire. 

I fell into a deep sleep in her arms, feeling her soft lips ghosting over my skin, her fingers gently stroking my hair. My dreams were haunted with headless horsemen. My coworker’s skulls were attached to his chain. I woke up crying and unfortunately, alone, fingers digging into my pillow.

Maybe I should go back to therapy.  

Hold on. Where’d Deirdre go? 

After that nightmare, I’d instantly panicked, rushing out to look for her, breathing a sigh of relief when I saw that she was just in the kitchen, making tea. I guess she’d been wanting to surprise me with breakfast in bed. Whoops.  

She did what she did best and calmed me down. The tea helped unclench the fist that was squeezing my heart. Before her, I was never much of a tea drinker, but it's been growing on me. 

The whole time, I could tell that she wanted to tell me something. I could see it in the set of her brow and the tightness of her mouth. The way she anxiously gripped her mug with both hands. When I questioned her on it, she told me that she was waiting until my mental state improved. Like the mentally healthy person that I am, I joked that if that were the case, she’d never have a chance to tell me anything. She didn’t find it funny. 

“A few weeks back, I saw my own death,” Deirdre eventually confessed to me.

Naturally, that threw me for a loop. “What? Hold on, ‘a few weeks back?’ And you’re just telling me *now?*”

She sighed shakily, dropping her mug onto the table so roughly that some of the liquid sloshed out, drenching her hand. She didn't notice. “You had enough on your plate. But you’re right. I shouldn’t have kept it from you. And you need to know that I've put you in a bad position. I didn't mean for it to happen, but it did.”

Deirdre then told me that she only had one more person left to guide. One more soul to spirit away, then she'll be free from the river. 

“Isn't that *good* news?” I questioned, not bothering to hide my confusion. 

“I was wondering how I was getting away with it,” She mused, eyes distant. “None of them ever stopped me from keening outside of their jurisdiction. Never. But those damned crows never stopped following me. And when the Huntsman retaliated against me, didn't it seem underwhelming to you?”

“No, it looked pretty terrible to me.” I disagreed in the kindest tone possible. 

She had begun to talk rapidly, sounding distracted, barely making sense. “If he were to kill me now, as a Weeper, he'd be breaking the river's claim on me. A transgression that is punished severely. However, as a human… That’d be a different story. And of course, the Huntsman knows it.”

It took a minute for my tired brain to catch up, but after she’d said that, I saw what she was getting at. 

Chills erupted over my skin as I voiced the realization out loud, “Iolo's waiting for you to turn human.” 

“He was the one in my premonition.” Deirdre confirmed gravely, eyes fixed on her mug. “And I’m sure it won’t surprise you to know that he does not intend to be kind about it.”

Something else. There was something else. Had Iolo not been bullshitting when he’d laid into her a couple weeks back? What had he meant by all of that? 

I questioned further, “Wait, hold on, how does this put *me* in a bad position?” 

“Do you remember the terms of our agreement?” She muttered, clenching her fists, near tears. “For translating the ledger, you swore to free me from the river. It was my suggestion. In my selfishness, I've doomed you. I've doomed us both.”

She then added, beginning to cry, “I’m no better than them, as much as I try to pretend otherwise. Just as deceptive. Just as self-serving.”

Thanks to my exhaustion, the gravity of her confessions didn’t click in my brain immediately. 

In summary, if I was going to complete my vow to her, I'd have to accomplish one of two impossible tasks: convince Iolo to not be a violent, jealous bastard, for once, or kill him. 

Judging by the way Gwyn acted around Victor, the king of the Wild Hunt has a peculiar interest in Orion. Even if I managed to take the mechanic’s life, that would introduce a litany of other problems, one of them being retaliation. As much as I love the idea of driving Ratcatcher through his vile heart, the cons outweigh the pros. 

I put my face in my hands, letting out a tired, muffled. “Well, shit.”

Admittedly, after dealing with the Dullahan and hearing about the Dead Duo's trials and tribulations, I didn't have the capacity to be as worried or angry as I ought to have been. 

She apologetically whispered, delicately touching my uninjured shoulder, “Nessa, if I'd known-”

“I don't blame you.” I assured her. “You risked a lot, so you had to ask for a lot.” 

“I’ll fix it!” She insisted through tears. “I’ll fix what I’ve started. You don’t need to worry about this. I’ll handle the Huntsman. I *will* fix this.” 

I came out of hiding to grumble, “We'll figure something out. Together. But… later.” 

What she said next shook me to my core. “I think I'll let him do it.”

That shook me up, “What?!”

“Each day that I'm like this, I can feel my heart change more and more,” She admitted softly. “I’m becoming more like them every day. As hateful. As vindictive. As unforgiving. I haven't been human in so long, and each day, I forget more and more what being mortal ever felt like. And this world… everything has changed so, *so* much.”

She turned to me, eyes red, shaking as if barely holding back sobs as she then asked, “What place do I have in this world, Nessa?”

I was so taken aback by all of this that I struggled to find words. *Any* words. 

The first thing I thought of to do was pull her close so that her cheek rested against my chest. For a moment, all I could manage to do was stroke her hair. 

Of all the things I'd considered when it came to her secrecy, I didn't realize it'd been an existential crisis. And yet another bad deal. One that she trapped me into, whether she meant to or not. 

I’m trying not to be mad at her. I believe her when she says that she didn’t mean for it to happen. But it did happen. 

That's when I just began to talk. Letting my heart find the words for me instead of my head, “I know it's not exactly the same, but when I was discharged, I felt like everything had gone wrong for a long time. Either I was wrong, or the world was wrong. I wasn't sure which.” 

Deirdre kept hiding her face against my sweatshirt. 

I continued, “It took me a lot of therapy and trial and error to figure out where I fit into regular life. Even now, I’m definitely still a bit on the fringe. My world is pretty well consumed with atypical pests and Neighbor nonsense. But now, I at least feel like I’m where I need to be.”

The Weeper raised her head, gray eyes searching mine, face and eyes reddened.

“You can’t find your place in this world if you don’t even give yourself a chance.” I told her. 

“I’ll fix this.” She repeated quietly. “I’ll wait to lead that last one. I’ll do anything. I just don’t want to be…”

*Like them.* She didn’t have to finish her sentence. 

“We don’t have to deal with it right this minute.” I reminded her. “It’s been a long couple of weeks. Hell, it’s been a long couple of *months,* but we’ve weathered the storm. You’re the indebtor. As long as you can wait, we can take our time. Figure it out rationally rather than having to act fast.”

Deirdre noticeably cringed when I referred to her as my ‘indebtor,’ but didn’t disagree with me. The guilt on her face was obvious. 

She nodded with a sniff. 

That’s something for future Nessa and Deirdre to deal with. For now, we’ve decided that the best thing we can do to try to regain some sanity is to let ourselves soak in the fact that *we made it.* We actually *made it.* 

I’ll be taking a bit of a break from posting. For how long, I don’t know. But the Neighbors will always be angry with us and people will always be… well, *people,* so I definitely will have some more stories to tell soon enough. And there are plenty from the past that I just haven’t gotten to. Specialty pest control definitely has job security, that’s for sure. 

That being said, we all need time to figure out where to go from here. A lot has happened for everyone. 

There is one bright side to all of this, though: Orion Pest Control has proven that our services can extend beyond some simple infestations. We’re still not heroes, but we try our best. For now, I think that’s enough.
