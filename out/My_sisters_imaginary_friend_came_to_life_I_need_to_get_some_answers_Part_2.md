WARNING: Mention of Sexual Assault

The next morning I awoke to my girlfriend giving me a kiss on the forehead as she left for work.

She asked briefly why I came home so late, and I told her I simply lost track of time. She knew why I was there. She knew how hard things had been for me. With a second kiss and a quick hand squeeze, she left for work. I sat upright on my bed, surveying my surroundings.

No [Alan](https://imgur.com/a/lIGEwWr).

I patrolled the entire apartment. He wasn’t anywhere to be found. With a sigh, I ate, took a shower, and got dressed. I had a night shift that didn’t start till 4, so I had time before then to make sense of what I’d gone through. 

Was Alan real? If no, then that was concerning. If yes, it was concerning for a bunch of different reasons.

The only proof I had of last night were the purple-striped bruises along my wrist and ankles, as well as the paper I had stashed in my pocket. I read it over a million times, making sure I hadn’t written it myself, or found it somewhere, and attached a false meaning to it.

2L3DF99.

I grabbed my laptop and searched for a website that could identify a driver with the license plate number. The one I decided on with the most credible reviews had a $60 paywall behind it. I had $60 to spare, but I felt like I shouldn’t do anything rash. Yes, if I could get some kind of Quentin Tarentino type revenge on the driver who killed my sister, I would in a heartbeat. There was no doubt in my mind I wanted justice, answers, some kind of comfort in knowing I could send him to jail. Let him rot behind bars all his miserable life. 

But in the past 24 hours, a lot has happened that made me genuinely question my own mental state. I didn’t want to be reckless. 

Cause if I did find this guy, how would the police trust me? They’d want to know my sources, and I can’t exactly tell them the truth. Also, if the driver was willing to flee the scene, it was very likely he wouldn’t confess. With no reliable witnesses, no video evidence, the bastard was scot free. The only person who knew was a figment of my sister’s imagination. And now, seemingly, my own.

I put the laptop down, and stood.

“Alan?” I called out, my last ditch effort. I wanted to think he wasn’t real, but I couldn’t shake the feeling he was. Living on in my sister’s memory, like a ghost. This time, as I searched, I looked more thoroughly. In every corner, under the bed, in the closets. Then, when I re-entered the master bath, I noticed why he’d been so hard to find. 

He’d been standing behind me this *entire time.*

No reflection in the mirrors. No sound of footsteps after my own, or feeling of breath against my neck. But if I watched closely, every time I moved my arm, I saw a slight trace of him echoing it. The smell of rotten sugar was so faint I had to concentrate deeply to detect it. He was barely visible, clinging to me like a shadow or reflection. 

Upon realizing, my first instinct was a lingering sense of fear. Not mine, but his. Childlike fear, like a toddler hiding behind their parents leg. I had so many questions to ask, but the only person who could answer was my sister. So, I got back into my car, hoping her childhood bedroom had more answers. Now, Alan seemed to phase from behind me to my passenger, coming more into view. This may have been his way of being more “comfortable.” A lot of these thoughts were merely speculation, guesses. 

When I got back to my parents home, only my mom was there. She was surprised to see me again, and asked how I’d been feeling. I simply said I wanted some more time with Nina’s belongings, and my mother understood. Not to the extent of Alan, but she didn’t question me. 

I studied the drawings more critically, noting what stood out. Nina first started drawing Alan when she was three years old. The last was from this year. Some showed Alan hiding inside her desk at school. Following her around. Playing hide and seek.

I was surprised to find one with me.

“*I saw my brother sneak out last night.*” She wrote as a caption. She was eleven, I was fifteen. “*I told Alan to make sure he got home safe.*”

I turned to the corner of the room, where Alan stood watching.

“Have you followed me before?” I whispered, not wanting my mother to hear. Alan didn’t respond, but I felt I knew the answer.

I got to the last of the pile, landing on one of the more concerning drawings. Well, the drawing itself was the typical Alan portrait, but the caption was what bothered me.

“*I made Alan real.*”

I was about to ask Alan another question when my mother opened the door. “I was going to run to the store,” She said. “Would you like me to grab you anything?”

“Actually, Mom, I have a question.” I began, choosing my words lightly. I didn’t want to worry her. 

I showed her some of the drawings, and she flipped through them.

“Is it about Alan?” She asked. “He’s quite the character, huh?”

“Nina seemed to think he was real.” I commented. “Up until adulthood. I know she had her quirks but…did you ever find that a bit odd?”

My mother looked at me with a troubled frown. I worried at first I may have offended her, but she stepped into the room, and sat at the foot of the mattress. 

“You see him too, don’t you?” She asked.

My eyes widened to the size of saucers.

“Kiel,” She sighed. “Do you see Alan? In this room?”

After a second to recollect myself, I nodded.

“How long…?” I began, but my mother patted the spot next to her, beckoning me to join her. I did.

“Not too long after she turned three, we took her to the dentist. I’m not sure you remember, but she hated the dentist. Hated it. Kicked and screamed the entire time, wouldn’t let the doctor anywhere near her. We tried to calm her down with toys, candy, but she wasn’t having any of it. Then, the doctor left and returned with this multicolored monkey doll. Said that if Nina held the monkey’s hand, it’d make her brave. Miraculously, it worked, and we were able to fix her cavity.”

She paused. “But before that point, she had a habit of…mumbling to someone. I always thought she was talking to herself while she played. When you got fed up with hours of dolly time, she’d start talking to her ‘friend.’ Said his name was Alan.”

A tear fell down her cheek. “And then, after the dentist, after she had been playing with Alan here and there, I…saw it. The multicolored monkey, only it was in her room, watching her play. He didn’t look nearly as peculiar as he does now. He was just an exact replica of that toy from the dentist’s.”

“So the toy wasn’t named Alan?” I clarified.

She shook her head. “I have no idea who Alan is. But after that day at the dentist, she gave him a form. A body to inhabit. And for some reason, I could *see* him. For a while, I was the only one. Then your father noticed too, and I was terrified. I was two seconds away from calling an exorcist or something, but your dad reassured me that Nina would grow out of him. That we’d only do something if he put her in danger. Thankfully, he never did, but he also never went away.

“After a while, I kind of got used to him. Weirdness aside, he used to be really cute. He’d snuggle up against her as she slept, and I swear she never had nightmares. He’d make her feel brave in school, calm her down if she got hurt playing or doing sports. It wasn’t until that day at church camp that Alan changed.”

I knew exactly what she was talking about. Nina and I were raised Christian, in a moderate sense. As a family, we’d say grace before dinner and try our best to attend Sunday service when we fit it into our schedule. I have long since re-align myself with being agnostic, as had Nina, but as kids we’d go to a summer church camp where we’d play games, do activities. One year we put on a small play about Adam and Eve. As one of the older kids, I had the role of Adam, while some girl I used to crush on was Eve. Another kid I went to school with was the Snake, another God, etc. The littles had more minor roles, like flowers, trees. She had a two-line speaking role with the kid who played God as the tree with the forbidden fruit. She felt more comfortable playing the role knowing I was there. 

And then she came to my bunk one night, sobbing and shaking. I asked her what was wrong. 

When she told me, I was enraged beyond belief. She didn’t understand what the kid playing God was doing to her, only that he scared her by breaking into the girl’s cabin and climbing into her bed. She told me where he touched her, what he said to her. I stormed out of the boy’s cabin, ready to beat that bastard to a bloody pulp.

But when I got to her cabin, all the girls stood outside in frantic sobs. “Eve” rushed past me, going to grab a counselor. I pushed past the crowd into the cabin, telling Nina to stay behind, and what I found was visceral.

The kid I was ready to beat was laying in a pool of his own blood. His mouth was warped into a scream, but he made no sound. Only stared wordlessly at his hands. 

Each of his fingers had been pulled and twisted, exposing bone and tendon. Like someone had tried to rip them all off, and hadn’t made it that far. In the dim lighting, the tendons of the fingers were long and black like licorice strands. 

“After that day,” My mom said, snapping me back to reality. “He began to take on more changes. He never slept in her bed anymore, either. Only watched from the ceiling, from a distance.”

*That’s why he attacked me*, I thought. *When I’d slept on her bed.*

He had adapted to the traumas of her life, taking them on like mutations.

“So,” I started, trying to process all of this information. “Now that Nina is….Why is he still here?”

My mother fought back tears, and I held her hand. “I’m sorry,” She began. “I should get to the store now.”

I hugged her, thanked her, and walked her to her car. As she drove off, I went back inside, and found Alan waiting by the door. I stared at him silently, deep into his eyes. 

He looked hungry. Maddened. 

Perhaps that’s why he’d come to me. He knew I felt the same.

I had some answers, but more questions. More troubling realizations brought to the surface. 

And yet, my end goal remained clear.

So I went back out to my car, and pulled out my phone.

“Hey, it’s Kiel,” I said. “I can’t come into work tonight.”

I glanced at Alan in my backseat. I retrieved the note from my pocket. Then sighed.

“I have some errands to run.”
