I moved to Casablanca last October for grad school. Found this ridiculously cheap apartment in an old colonial-era building, one of those big beige stone ones with cracked plaster, an iron staircase that screams at every step, and wooden floors that creak like they’re telling secrets. It felt like it had a soul. I told myself it was “character.”

I didn’t know a single soul in the city. Most days I’m buried in my thesis, and at night, I sit by the window pretending I’m fine with the silence.

But the silence didn’t last long.

Around the end of my second week, I started hearing a voice. Always at the same time: 10 p.m. Low, slow… like someone praying, or whispering to themselves. At first, I assumed it was a neighbor watching TV with the volume up. But it didn’t sound like it came from inside a room. It felt… directed. Focused. Like it was aimed at me.

One night, curiosity got the better of me. I laid flat on the floor and pressed my ear to the wooden boards. The voice was coming from below.

The next morning, I knocked on the downstairs door, pretending I had mail delivered to the wrong address. No answer. I went across the hall and found Madame Fadma, an older woman who wears a haïk and always has that look like she knows more than she says.

When I asked about the downstairs apartment, she shook her head and said, “The man passed. Died alone. May God have mercy on him. Some say they still feel things… but no one’s lived there since.”

She said it so matter-of-factly, but her eyes didn’t match her tone. There was something… off. Like she wanted to say more, but swallowed it back.

I tried to convince myself it was old plumbing or echoes from the pipes. But then the voice started saying my name. Not once. Repeatedly. Sometimes with a sigh, sometimes like a warning:
“You’re alone.”
“Can you hear me?”

I told myself it was pipes. That maybe the old plumbing carried sound in weird ways. I even started recording it. When I played it back, the audio was muddy, like water rushing through a tunnel. But if I closed my eyes and listened carefully, I could almost pick out a word, a breath, a syllable buried between the sounds. Never clear. Never enough to prove anything.

That’s when I remembered what the old concierge told me when I moved in:
“These buildings were built with underground maintenance tunnels. Back from the French days. For water, gas, and… other things.”
He laughed when he said that. “Here, the walls have ears,” he added. “And sometimes, mouths.”

I thought he was joking. I don’t laugh about it now.

One night around 3 a.m., I woke up to what sounded like someone dripping water straight onto the tiles. But it wasn’t coming from the kitchen or bathroom. It was beneath my bed. Right under it. My body froze. Then—footsteps. Just one, two, slow, dragging. Then a whisper, so close to my ear it felt wet:

“You stayed….”

I didn’t sleep that night. I didn’t even move.

The next day, I asked Madame Fadma if she’d ever heard anything strange. She didn’t answer me right away. She just touched her haïk, looked over her shoulder, and said quietly:

“You hear it too, then,” she said. “The water. The whisper.”

I froze. I had never mentioned a voice. Only she and I were in that hallway, but it suddenly felt full—like someone was listening in.

“Why haven’t you left?” I asked. “If you’ve heard it this whole time?”

For a moment, she just looked at me with those tired eyes. Then she touched my arm gently.

“Because once it sees you… once you hear it… it doesn’t matter where you go. You’ve been chosen. Imprinted.”
She paused. “I used to think it was this place that’s cursed. But no… It’s us now.”

I left her there, standing alone by her door. I couldn’t bring myself to respond.

I don’t know what’s under that floor, but I’m starting to think it’s not human. Maybe something trapped. Or something waiting.

Last night, I recorded again. Just for proof.

And this time, I heard something different. A voice, clear and low:

“Don’t be afraid… we haven’t even started yet.”

I don’t know what that means. But I’m not sleeping tonight.

And I think I’ll start sleeping with shoes on.
