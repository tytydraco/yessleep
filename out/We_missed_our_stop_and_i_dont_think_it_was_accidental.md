I had been given this transcribed by a friend who soon after had taken his life. This is the only place I know that might be able to use it. 



Video Log  D

“We had woken up from our pods today, and it was much colder than I expected. I mean, I knew I was gonna be cold, but half of us woke up with colds, and James just didn't. I still remember so vividly Arthur waking him and hearing the bone, skin, and tissue crunch so loudly. We decided it was best to keep him in his pod, as half his body had snapped off trying to remove him. I know it's gonna be bad when he starts defrosting. Have you seen someone frozen completely? it's aufwale. The blood vessels are intertwined with the bone, with a glossy, icy surface. It looked like a science fair project more than a human.  Anyway, this is for work purposes. We missed Kep-168f; we were supposed to be there now, but we were all about 5 years past it, so after everyone is better, we will fix the ship and get back on course.”



Log D

First report back, we missed the destination and had been floating for quite some time, about 5 years past. We are still alive. James isn't, though his pod malfunctioned and froze him to death. We should be back on course in a month max, though. Please report back as soon as possible; the guys aren't holding up well and need moral support.

Video Log E

“Ive been hearing noises, and it's worrying me. Tech boy has been telling me it's just the ship’s age, but I don't trust it. I think someone's up at night, and as the leader, it's concerning me that someone isn't following protocol. If it keeps happening ill do more ill have to take more drastic precautions. All our colds suck well, expect Aurther and jammie who both don't have one. And we did get James out of his pod finally, the ice melted around him, and before anything spilt out, we had gotten him in a waste bag. Felt weird holding him like that, the worst part i got him to join this program, and it's my fault hes gone. I really miss the kid. (sniffles can audibly be heard) Oh, look at me, tearing up on work time. I should just end it here.”



Log E 

The ship had been more damaged than thought before; it seems something blew up or a pipe burst. The main conclusion is that we hit something, and some air takes over, but we won't be able to find out till repairs are made. We haven't even been able to work on pods yet. Keadon seems to be over-stressed and hopes he will be okay under this much pressure. Arthur has been doing daily checkups on people and trying to make sure no one gets worse. Send a word as soon as you receive this.

Personal message 



“I'm worried about her, she's been acting weird, and like I know why, but there really isn't any reason for it.”



“Who? Big J?”



“Yeah”



“She's always been like this, though, and we know she's still on her meds, so she shouldn't relapse.”



“Maybe I'll take her down to med, and Arthur can help. I wonder if it's just her cold.”



Messages afterwards are deemed unimportant 

  


Video Log F

“Just start talking? When?” “Now it's going already.” “Oh shit, my bad, well I've been asked to give an update on the state of our ship, and well it's not great. We took heavy damage on the ship while under cryo, and it's been really tough on the guys. We've all been trying to fix it, and being sick for sure isn't helping. As their boss i need to make sure they are ok, but Jully wants us to work nonstop, except on nights, of course. Because it's “not safe”.  Bullshit. Well, I guess I shouldn't complain about a break. Actually, how does she know when it's night and day? I know she has the clock, but like, there is no way with time zones and everything.



Jake Baker arose from his seat and left. The recording goes on for another 30 minutes before the auto shut-off. Nothing of note happens during this time.

  


Video Log G

Commander Jully coughs into a rag for several seconds.

“I'm... I'm okay. I think the crew thinks I'm unwell. Witch i am, we're all fucking terrible. God, i cant keep this even professional now. Okay, sothe ship is still highly damaged and possibly getting worse. Damage is possibly fatal; we need supplies as soon as possible. We may even need an emergency landing, but all nearby plants are either gas or the atmosphere is way to denss. Crew update, I believe Arthur may have contracted something from us and doesn't want to tell us; he's acting off. Head twitching, body seems spasming, and even when he sleeps now, he randomly jults up. All extremely worrying things, and I can't help, I think I may need to force him (Loud coughing from Jully spitting up blood into her elbow). Ill. I'll report next time. 

  
  
  


Log G

The ship cargo area has been rummaged throug seeming a member has been going through stuff unauthorised, and the cameras in the area have been down. Food is getting lower; we are nearing only a few years max. Mission is impossible now either we make it and die with only a start-up, or we attempt to make it back. Will recall if no response in the coming months. 



Video Log B 

“This is Arthur. We have stopped and secured the possession. Incubation has begun and will soon start to take place. After reaching the destination, we should be able to fully secure the packages”.

 The rugged man goes off-screen for a short while, and little is heard.

“Come on, this can't be the only way cant we do it on a nobody, why her?” 

A younger woman is heard in response. 

“We listen to orders thats all.” 

A sigh of defeat is heard from the man as he returns. 

“Orders have been completed and soon will be finished.” 



Video Log H

“Tech boy said something the other day. He asked why I know each time it's day and night or why it matters, i wasnt able to answer other than its protical. What are you doing? I know you will receive these, maybe not now, maybe not for a while, or maybe you already have them, but I don't trust it. I'm breaking protocol tonight im staying up, and I'm finding out whatever youve done.”



Log H

Food seems to run out faster; it seems the boys are eating more. Ship repairs are actually seeming okay now. Sickness is nearly all gone, it seems, being so close, we keep recontaminating each other, though. Is anyone even reading these? 



Video Log L 

“Last words are so hard, i though id be okay with death by now, but I'm just as scared as a kid under his sheets at night. (tears started forming around his eyes) This is Jake maintenance team learn. All my boys are dead, at least I hope so. (His voice lowers more) Something got them, i dont even know what. That thing came out of nowhere, and it's turned them into some sort of pulp. I can't even describe such a thing, man. Fuck jully was right. (Whipping his eyes clean). If from whatever merical krisy and georgia sees this, I love you guys, and sorry i couldnt make it home. 



Video log I 

“Nothing i found nothing. I was wrong, god fucking damnit. The team was right; nothing was down there all night. No matter what, someone been stealing shit, and that needs to still be found out. I think it was part of my tiredness too i just been sleeping a lot more it seems.  Home base, sorry for my out busrt it had been extremely unprofessional, and I wish to still ask for aid and word back.”



Log I

Aurther is getting sicker. Bottom of the ship is finally useable it seems, and they have started on the cryo pods. Some of them seem beyond repair. Foods lowering still faster than normal, so we need to ration now if we want enough to be able to last till the pods are fixed. We had over 5 years of food and somehow were nearing worrying numbers; it just doesn't make sense. Otherwise, ironically, everyone other than Arthur seems neither contagious nor sick. 



Video Log J

(Counghing spitting up mucus, and slight blood).” I guess I was wrong about Aurther being the only one. Anyways the ship has been too quiet recently, like all noise has been sucked out, but only when it's night, which it should be. It's just after that night I stayed up all night watching everything had gone quiet. I didn't say this before because I just didn't know what to think, but I did find dried wet spots that seemed to be going up the walls like something slimy is crawling up them. (Deep coughing for several moments). Anyways i need to head up soon to the med bay. 



Log J

Ship repairs are coming along as well as good spirits for the men. Most people seem okay with our situation, and it seems we should be able to get into pods before food is out, still worried though about that. We should be set to leave in about a month, and with rations we have, about 2-3 months of them, so even if the worst happens, we will be okay. 



Video log K

(Aurther with audible sobbing) “God fucking damnit you said she wouldn't die, you fucking lied! Now that thing is out there, god damnit i dont even know what happened to her, she just got atomized. Her whole body was just a sludge of goo and other bodily fluids. (more audible sobbs come from him) What did you have us bring?! It's coming to Earth now, and I know there is no way for us to stop it.  Fuck it, it seems to be on a clock from sleep and awake, so I'm waiting to get back to the control center, and you fuckers ain't getting this thing if I have any power to stop it!” (Noteable high pitched clicking noise is heard as the camera stops)
