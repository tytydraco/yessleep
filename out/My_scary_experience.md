this happened to me a few years back. For some background My family had just moved into a new house it was in a good neighborhood it had good people and low crime just the perfect neighborhood. I had some trouble getting used to the new house since I grow up in our old one. I also had my own room which was a first for me. I was always scared of being alone at time which I got over eventually. The first month went good we all got used to the area. I started to go outside and made friends with the kids in the area. One day I went around the block on my skate board I saw from the corner of my eye a black car just sitting there.

I didn't think much of it until it came closer I started to go faster it keep coming as soon as I look at the diver they drove off from what I saw the diver looked to be male his windows where tinted so it was hard to make out features. I thought the experience to be just weird not thinking much of it. At the time I thought it was a great neighborhood and nothing bad could happen. A week later my dad brought me to the park. This park was big it had a playground and skate park also a basketball court. I was riding around the skate park while my dad and brother where at the playground when I saw the car I saw a week ago this time I started to think something was wrong I got a better look at the car. I tired to see the license plate but the car was gone pretty fast, I started to feel uneasy and felt like I was getting stalked. I told my friends about it and they thought it wasn't real as I was the joker of the group. I asked them to help me catch them and they somehow agreed. We had made a plan to use bait to lure them in. We spent hours outside but finally the car had been spotted. It cams around the corner but as soon as it came close my friends jumped out and got pictures. We all then ran to my friend Diego's house after looking through all the pictures we had actually gotten a good picture of the licence plate.

It was getting late though and we decided to all go home and deal with it in the morning. That night I woke up at 2am to go to the bathroom. Our bathroom had a tiny window high up to get steam out from the shower so you could hear some stuff outside. As I was doing my business I heard footsteps from the backyard I was thinking it was a cat as there is A lot of stray cats around my street but they seemed to loud and I was highly unlikely a big animal had gotten into my back yard. I ended up going to my bed when I heard the noise of glass breaking I was pretty young but I knew what had happened whoever was in that car knew where I lived knew we had his license plate on a picture. I could think to hide in my closet. Now I liked to be prepared for anything so I had a hiding spot where it was hard to find it was behind my brothers toy box covered with some toys in the back. I quickly got in and stayed quiet. Seconds felt like hours as I heard the foot steps draw closer I knew any second they would enter my room. I was there in my closet trying not to freak out I felt my heart beating fast I was resisting the urge to scream. At that moment the door opened very slowly to not draw attention of my parents. The man was around 5'7 with curly black hair. I was peaking out of a small hole I made with the toys to get a good look he looked around my bed. He looked around my desk.

. .    I knew any second he would find me. Now this next moment might have been the work of an angel but somehow my dad who was a very deep sleeper had heard the glass and called the police as the man was looking under my bed sirens could be heard. As soon as they became louder the man had heard them he ran out of my room and left the house.he managed to escape before the police got to my home. I told the police about the picture of his license plate and they where able to track down the man the scary thing is he lived a few blocks away and had probably been Watching me as soon as we moved in. The man turned out to be a big drug user and was on them during the break in. I had found out that he had also gotten in jail multiple times for DUIs. I get goosebumps just typing this thinking how lucky I I'm to be alive I'm not sure what the mans intentions where but I'm sure it was something bad. 4 years later and where still in the same house I now make sure to always watch my back because of that experience I now I'm forever changed always make sure to tell a trusted adult when you feel scared or suspicious. If I had done that the first time it happened he wouldn't ever came to my house. STAY SAFE!
