I'm not sure if it was real. Maybe I was just high. But that doesn't matter for now, and I will post my story here just in case.

I work as a delivery man, bringing every type of food from the kitchen to someone's house. It doesn't pay much, but it's enough to pay my part of the rent.

But, I think that after what happened to me, a new job is something to focus on. 

It all started last week. I needed to deliver some food to an apartment that looked normal and somewhat modern from the outside. Going to the entrance, I said to the security person working there that I had to deliver food to apartment 225 and waited some time so he could say that they would come down and get the food, like a normal delivery. Instead, he said something strange.

"Take this ticket and do not do anything to it, just go to floor 25th and you will find what you want." as I was grabbing the paper, I noticed his black suit.

"Thanks mister." I said, not trying to sound rude. "Just call me Etaf." He said, smiling.

After that first weird encounter, I got inside the building and into the elevator, clicked the button and waited as it was going up until it stopped at the 2th floor.

As the metal doors opened, it was almost impossible to see outside, just a little from the light coming from the elevator.

After two seconds of silence, I was able to hear the sound of dragging, there was someone coming to the elevator and it was dragging something, or better say, someone. I don't know why, it was just instinct, but I grabbed the ticket and held it in front of me, and I thank god for that.

The first thing I saw was a woman. She was sweating and on one of her hands were some wings. They were obviously fake, but I didn't know the material to be exact. Maybe porcelain, plastic. For me it didn't matter after I saw what she was dragging.

A person, a man to be more exact. I am not sure if he was dead or just unconscious, but what i could see was that he had bandages covering his head, which were useless since it was still leaking blood, leaving a trail from the corridor to the elevator, a trail that was being cut by the closing of the doors. I was paralyzed, I couldn't move or speak, that was until I noticed the woman looking at me. She looked at me, the ticket, and the food I was carrying and asked me a simple question.

"Which floor?"

I was resilient at first, but after remembering all the horror stories I used to read, I decided to speak (didn't want to get her angry).

"The 25th. Apartment number 225." I said, not trying to look at the man on the floor.

She smiled at me, like everything happening was normal. "That's me!" She said, pausing and looking at what she was carrying. "I can't take the food now, but you can follow me to my apartment and I take the food there. Don't worry, you won't get hurt."

The rest of the elevator ride was agonizing to say the least, and when I came to the 25th floor, it got much worse.

As the doors for the elevator opened, she started walking to the right. The person she was dragging made her go slowly and I followed her from behind, maintaining a short distance. Once she gets to the apartment, she drops the person's legs and grabs her keys from the pocket, places them on the door, opening it.

What I saw inside wasn't something forgettable.

Hooks hanging from the ceiling, at least two more bodies both in strange positions and a lot of blood everywhere. She noticed my distress and looked at me with a compassionate face. "You don't need to enter if you don't want to, just leave the food by the door and leave this cursed place." She said and, without a doubt, I dropped the food and ran away.

I entered the elevator and punched the ground floor button, shortly after the doors closed and I knew I was safe. Once I came to the ground floor, Etaf was waiting for me with his hand extended. "Could you please return the ticket?" He said.

That's when I noticed that I dropped it on the 25th floor. I looked at him and said, "I dropped it and forgot to pick it up."

The man just gave a small chuckle and said to me. "You are lucky that she didn't see you dropping it or that no one else found you on the way down Mister." I looked at him without knowing what to do. "Now, I think it is for the best if you run away now, if someone find you without the ticket you are dead meat." 

I followed his instructions without even thinking. I ran to the entrance and out of the building, got in my car and drove all the way to the restaurant. I quitted on the spot and left for my home.

I'm just writing this because one of my friends said that it helps to forget about it. I'm not sure how but I hope it works.

And I hope to not see that building ever again.
