We've always been close, Lucas and I. Our father had left before we had a chance to remember him, our mother was barely home, working two jobs to make ends meet, so we only ever had each other. Even when we outgrew the toddler stage, went to school, met new peope, made new friends, it was always "Lucas and Monica". Always a duo, always together.

Nobody ever questioned it. After all, it's not uncommon for twins to develope a bond much tighter than that between normal siblings, between friends, between lovers. So except some odd looks, no one ever batted an eye when I cried when we were put in different classes in school, or when Lucas refused to leave my side at the hospital after I broke my arm. Mom worked night shifts, so I crawled into Lucas' bed when I had a nightmare and mom never said anything about it when she found us curled around each other in the morning.

Even as we grew older, there was no such thing as "my friends" and "his friends". It was always "our friends", because him and I shared everything, even people. For the longest time, it didn't strike me as odd, just because it was so natural, so logical. Him and I were two halves of one soul, so it made perfect sense that we would give half of our lives to each other.

And it was fine, really. We relied on each other, no matter what happened, and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.

It was fine, until it wasn't.

We were sixteen, and a girl at school was in love with my brother. Her name was Gina, they had biology together, and she was absolutely beautiful. Lucas didn't seem to notice the way she looked at him, the hesitant smiles and shy "hello"s, the way she progessively seemed to spend more time styling her hair and doing her make-up. It was almost heartbreaking to see the disappointment on the poor girl's face when my brother paid no attention to her.

I brought it up to him eventually. Not that I was enthusiastic about sharing him with another person, but because it felt like the right thing to do. Lucas deserved a relationship, he deserved to be happy, and Gina was nice and attractive, so I informed him that she was in love with him and he should ask her out.

He did, then, and I had never seen anyone smile as bright as Gina did when she said yes.

They dated for a short while, and it was odd. Suddenly there was a whole other person between us, taking up Lucas' time, and I wasn't exactly jealous, and we didn't argue about it, but I couldn't deny that having him spend so much time with someone else felt like some part of me had been cut off. Like a missing limb; phantom pain.

He brought her home one night, to have sex with her. Mom still worked night shifts and she'd stopped hiring a babysitter once we were old enough to take care of ourselves, so they had all the privacy they could get in our house. They disappeared into Lucas' room as soon as they came home from dinner, while I stayed in the living room so that I wouldn't hear them through the wall our rooms shared.

About  half an hour later, I could hear their raised voices over the noise of the TV. A door was slammed shut and I turned around to see Gina, clothes and hair in disarray, hands clutching her purse, tears staining her reddened cheeks. She stopped, looked at me, her pretty face distorted in anger and disgust, and then she was out the front door.

I paid no second thought to her, to whether or not she was okay, to how she would get home. Instead, I got up from the couch and headed to my brother's room, pushing the door open without knocking. Lucas sat on his bed, pale as a ghost, eyes wide as he looked up at me. "What happened?", I asked as I sat down next to him.

The color returned to his face in an instant as he blushed crimson red. "I don't want to talk about it", he answered, but his eyes, his expression, told me all I needed to know. I didn't press the issue. Instead, I waited for him to settle into his bed, took my place next to him like I was used to, and tucked the blanket over both of us. Neither of us mentioned Gina again, not that night and not any other day either.

A week after that night, Lucas fell sick.

It started out normal. The sickness crept up on him like any common cold would, with a cough that could be brushed off. As it got worse, he clung to me more than usual, refusing to leave my side. It wasn't too odd; both of us tended to get clingy when we were sick. And to be completely honest, after the brief episode with Gina I was so happy to have him back that I didn't mind him being a little too clingy.

Over the weekend, his sickness got worse. We cancelled plans with our friends and spent our days on the couch instead, watching whatever Netflix show caught our interest or playing video games. I figured Lucas had simply caught a cold or maybe the flu, so I reminded him to drink tea, asked mom to cook some chicken soup for him, and waited for him to get better.

Only that he didn't get better.

The night before monday, he came into my room, pale and shivering and with dark bags under his eyes, and I wordlessly made space for him so he could lie down in my bed. That had been par for the course back when we were kids, even though mom had hated it; she'd always tried to keep us seperated when one of us was sick, but we always ended up sneaking into the others room and catching whatever disease the other had. That old habit had stuck, though that night, Lucas' behaviour was unusual.

Usually him and I would lie on opposite sides of the bed, rarely ever touching, simply satisfied to have another body close. Tonight, however, when he crawled into my bed, he settled close to me and wrapped an arm around my waist, pulling me closer until my back was pressed against his chest. We touched all the time, of course – a hand on the other's shoulder, fingers wrapped around a wrist, legs across the other's lap – but in that moment, my body went completely rigid under the unexpected touch. This was so much closer than usual, almost suffocating in the way I could feel his fever-hot skin through the fabric of my pajamas.

"What are you doing?", I asked, my voice nothing but a whisper in the pitch black room.

"I can't sleep", was his answer, hoarse from his coughing, strained as if it exhausted him to speak. "Please, Monica." His voice broke at that plea.

I didn't like it. The heat of his feverish body, the way his arm pinned me in my place, his hot breath against the back of my neck, it was all too much, made my heart beat at a hummingbird pace. And yet, I couldn't bring myself to throw him out, not when he was sick and he needed my company. So instead, I nodded and put my hand on top of his. "Okay."

Lucas sighed with relief and pulled me impossibly closer.

I didn't catch any sleep that night. Lucas never let go off me, not even for a moment, and I laid awake, staring into the darkness of my room, fighting for every breath although it felt like the air refused to reach my lungs. When mom came into my room the next morning, she took one look at us – Lucas pale and drenched in sweat and still couging, and me with dark bags under my bleary eyes – sighed and called the school to tell them we were both sick.

Two days later, when the fever still wouldn't break, mom took him to the doctor, who diagnosed him with "probably the flu", told mom to give him some generic meds and sent them home. The odd thing was, even though he spent every night in my bed, I didn't catch his illness. All I suffered from was fatigue and a consistent headache from the lack of sleep, but there was no fever, no cough, despite our constant proximity.

At this point I was just waiting for him to get better, for the medication to do its job, for him to recover, for everything to return back to normal. I wanted to sleep, and for probably the first time in my life, I wanted some distance from my brother. Once he got better, once he started sleeping in his own bed again, we would both be fine.

The problem was, he didn't get better.

Mom eventually had me going back to school, while Lucas stayed at home, still sick. I was tired to the point where I used the lunch break to get some sleep, I barely paid attention in class, much to my teachers' annoyance, but other than that, I was fine. Lucas, on the other hand, got worse every day.

He was in bad shape already, but as soon as I started going back to school, his condition worsened rapidly. Whatever he suffered from was much worse than a regular flu, that much was obvious in the way his body deteriorated. It was terrifying to see him lose weight, see his pale skin glisten with sweat from a fever that refused to break, and not being able to do anything about it. I knew mom was worried as well, but she couldn't just quit one of her jobs, especially not now, and I didn't mind taking care of my brother. I had done that since we were kids anyways.

Mom seemed to notice my fatigue though; not that I'd been able to hide it very well. I knew she talked to Lucas and told him to stay in his own bed, I knew it from the way my brother glared at her and how he retreated to his own room that night without explanation. I felt bad for him, really, but the relief that I might get a full night's sleep managed to override my guilty conscience. I pulled the blanket up to my chin and fell asleep the moment I turned the lights off.

I woke a few hours later, still in the middle of the night, and I when I opened my eyes I felt a jolt of terror like I'd never known before when I saw the face of death itself above me. I didn't flinch, didn't even scream as fear kept my frozen in place, unable to move under the monster's gaze. I wondered if this was what sleep paralysis felt like, being forced to face down his gaunt, skull-faced thing with no chance for escape, and my breath got stuck in my throat at the thought. For an endless moment, I waited for the reaper to reach out; I was dizzy from holding my breath, nauseous from my rapid heartbeat, the blood rushing in my ears drowned out any sound the monster might have made.

And then my eyes got used to the halflight of the full moon and I recognized that the thing above my bed, the monster with the sunken eyes and the greyish skin stretched tight over a skull, was my brother.

"You scared me", I told him, my voice shaking so much that the words blurred together.

"I'm sorry, Monica. I can't sleep." He barely sounded like himself anymore, voice hoarse and rough and hollow. Hesitantly, he reached out for me, his boney fingers stopping just before touching my cheek. "Let me stay here. I can't... I'm suffocating, Monica. I'm suffocating without you."

And I'm suffocating with you, I didn't say. He was hurting, and if I could soothe his pain I couldn't deny him my help. "Okay", I whispered, and he climbed into the bed like he always did. My skin was cool, clammy from the fear, and I almost expected him to leave burn marks when he pressed his scorching face into the crook of my neck. My breathing was rapid, shallow. Another sleepless night for me, as he pulled me close as if he wanted us to melt together.

When mom found us the next morning, she didn't comment on it, but the defeated look on her face said enough.

"Stay home today", Lucas pleaded when I was about to get ready for school.

"I can't." Rather, I didn't want to, because every moment at home was spent with him now, and in school I had a few hours to myself.

He was still in my bed and even in daylight, he looked like death. His eyes were sunken, bloodshot, his skin greyish pale. His raven hair had started to turn grey, his body was nothing but skin and bone. "Please", he asked, and grasped my wrist with long, thin fingers. Had they always been this long? "It's so much worse when you're gone. I can't breathe when you're not here."

And I gave in, of course, and played up the headache in front of my mom so she would let me stay home.

Lucas followed me around the house the entire day, even if it was just a short trip to the kitchen. To call him a shell of himself would be generous; the thing that held my hand, or kept his hand around my wrist, or his arms around my shoulders, was a distortion mirror image of my brother, a copy of a copy of a copy until there was barely a recognizable feature left. I pitied him just as much as he scared me; I nearly flinched every time I looked at him.

We settled on the couch and I was used to him leaning on me, but that day he climbed into my lap, arms wrapped around my neck, forehead resting against my shoulder. He wasn't heavy, of course he wasn't, but I still thought I would collapse under his weight, burn to ash under his heat. I wanted to shove him off, to get away from this frail, skeletal thing that claimed to be my brother, but I put my arms around him instead.

"I'm hurting you, right?", he asked, not lifting his head, not looking at me.

I felt like I was burning alive. "I'm fine. Just a little tired", I lied to him instead.

He shook his head. "I know you're not. Monica, I'm so sorry... I don't want to hurt you. You know that, right?"

"I know." I slowly lifted a hand and brushed through his now white hair. "Of course I know." That, at least, was the truth.

Without another word, he got up and disappeared into his room.

He tried to sleep alone that night. For my sake. I could hear him cough through the wall our rooms shared, and it kept me awake until midnight as I imagined him in his bed, struggling for every breath. Despite everything, I couldn't stand the thought of him suffering like this, and eventually I made my choice, stood up and walked over to his room.

He turned his head as I entered, a grimace surrounded by a halo of ghostly white, and his expression broke into a smile that was too wide, wider than his mouth should have been able to stretch. Dread settled in my stomach, I almost turned back around, but I climbed into his bed instead, settled with my back against his chest, as always. He wrapped his arm around me, his hand – the fingers too long, longer than they should be, more claws than anything else – against my stomach, under my shirt. The touch was like a live wire, but I was used to white hot pain at this point.

"What if I'm making you sick?", I asked quietly.

"You're the only thing that makes me feel better", he countered. Rough. Hissing. "The only remedy that's helping." His grip tightened; the tip of his claw-like fingers against my ribs. "My Monica."

I didn't argue. He'd owned half my life for as long as we'd been alive. I might as well give him the other half too.

If a few tears fell from my eyes, they dried on the pillow, unnoticed.

When I woke the next morning, I turned to see the thing next to me in broad daylight, bones protruding through paper-thin skin, looking more dead than alive now with its eyes closed, and the realization that I had willingly crawled into the bed of this creature made me sick. Shoving the arm off of me, I scrambled out of bed and hurried to the bathroom, fell to my knees in front of the toilet and puked my guts out. The memories of last night, smiles with too many teeths, claws against my skin, possessive whispers in the dark; the thought that this creature that had once been my brother considered me to be his was too much for me.

When no more bile came out, I rose to my feet, crossed the distance to the sink with unsteady steps, and washed my mouth out. Then, when I looked up, into the mirror above, I was hit by an intense wave of vertigo at the sight.

My hair, raven black like my brother's, had turned pale white overnight.

I took a few deep breaths, and when I was sure I wouldn't faint, I made my way to the kitchen, where mom was making breakfast. She turned around and her face fell when she saw me standing in the doorway. "What happened?"

I couldn't even answer her, because in that moment, all the tears I'd held back for so long finally came out. She didn't say anything, just held me in my arms as I cried until I managed to mutter Lucas' name between sobs and hiccups and her arms tightened around me then. She promised it would be alright, even though I knew that nothing would ever be alright again.

I don't know who she called. Maybe our doctor, maybe the hospital, maybe she found some contact information on the internet, I didn't know and I didn't care. All I knew was that later that day, people arrived at our home that weren't paramedics, at least not normal ones, and they were here to take Lucas away.

Why hadn't she done this sooner, I wanted to ask, but this was not the time for accusations.

I stood next to my mother as they took him, rolling him out on a stretcher because he was too weak to walk. She had an arm around me, held me back when Lucas reached out for me, begged to touch me one last time to ease his unbearable pain. Mom and I both cried.

Twin Sickness, a woman in an expensive suit told me when I asked. Rare, but not rare enough; destructive in a way few non-fatal diseases were.

"Can he be healed?", I asked her, because despite everything that had happened, the moment they wheeled him out the door I wanted nothing more but my brother back.

The woman shook her head. "Not healed, but we can manage the symptoms. He'll be able to have a normal life at some point, as long as he never sees you again. I'm sorry."

It hurt more than anything else, the knowledge that I had lost my other half forever. "What about me?" I reached for one of my white hair strands. "I'm just as sick as he is", I told her, thinking back to how I had never pushed him away, how I had went to him voluntarily.

Again, she shook her head, her expression full of pity. "You're not sick, Monica", she promised me. "What you have is a mimicry of his symptoms, that's normal for the other twin to develope. It'll fade, now that he's gone."

She was right about that. It's been years since they took Lucas away, and my hair has regained it's natural color. I don't know where he is today; I haven't seen him since that day three years ago.

Mom and I don't talk about him. We pretend he never existed, and people have stopped asking long ago.

I wish I could say I'm doing fine, but I'd be lying. I see him in my dreams, and when I wake I don't dare to open my eyes, expecting him to stand above me in the darkness, watching me sleep. Some days I wake and think I still feel his arms around me, feel the burn of feverish skin against my waist, my stomach. When I'm home alone I think I see movement in the corner of my eye, and when I turn I expect to find bloodshot eyes staring at me. I imagine flashes of white hair, hot breath against the back of my neck, the sound of coughing from his room, and it all feels too real.

I'm terrified of facing him again, yet I know I will seek him out somehow, someday. He's always owned half of me, and I can't continue to live my life as half a soul. I hate him, and I'm scared of him, and I miss him more than anything.

One day, we'll be reunited, and his fever might burn me to cinders, but at least we'll burn together.
