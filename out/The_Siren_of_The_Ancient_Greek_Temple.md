There were rumors about this hidden Greek temple, forgotten by time, said to guard a treasure of unimaginable value. Being there, I wasn’t sure what I expected to find—gold, jewels, maybe some ancient artifact. But what I discovered was something far more terrifying.

It was her.

She appeared out of the shadows, and I froze. She was massive—easily fifteen feet tall—and unlike anything I’d ever seen. Her body shimmered as though she’d just risen from the depths of the sea, droplets of water clinging to her skin. A sheer, transparent cloth draped over her like a second skin, accentuating her otherworldly form. She looked like a siren from myth, but there was something *wrong*—something that made my stomach twist in fear.

Her eyes locked onto mine. They were filled with longing—desperate, aching—and for a moment, I couldn’t move. Then she whispered something soft and haunting, a sound that sent chills down my spine. Before I could process what was happening, she moved.

She was fast—far faster than anything that size should be. Her massive steps echoed through the temple as she came after me, her gaze fixed on me like I was the only thing that mattered in the world. My instincts kicked in, and I ran.

The temple was a maze of crumbling stone and shadowy corridors, but I didn’t have time to think about where I was going. All I knew was that she was behind me, her presence suffocating and relentless. This wasn’t just a chase—it felt personal. She wanted me. Needed me.

I turned a corner sharply, and that’s when it happened. Her wrist grazed one of the jagged blades jutting out from the temple walls—ancient traps meant to keep intruders like me away. It was barely a scratch, but what spilled from the wound stopped me in my tracks.

Her blood wasn’t red; it was blue—a glowing, ethereal shade that shimmered like liquid starlight. It dripped onto the floor with a hiss, eating through the stone like acid. The sight of it mesmerized me for a moment—it was beautiful and horrifying all at once.

But she didn’t stop.

If anything, she became more frantic. Her eyes were wide with sorrow now, tears streaming down her face like rivers of molten silver. Her cries echoed through the temple—a mournful wail that made my chest ache even as fear drove me forward.

I ran harder, but she stayed close behind me. Another blade caught her arm as she reached for me again, opening another wound. More of that glowing blue blood poured out, sizzling as it hit the ground and casting an eerie light on the walls around us. The air grew thick with its sharp scent, and my lungs burned as I pushed myself to keep going.

Then she stumbled.

Her massive form wavered before collapsing to the ground with a thundering crash. She let out a cry—a sound so raw and full of pain that it stopped me in my tracks again. Her shoulders shook as she sobbed, her tears pooling on the floor in shimmering puddles of light.

I should’ve kept running—I *wanted* to keep running—but something about her sorrow rooted me in place. It wasn’t just fear anymore; it was something else… guilt? Pity? Whatever it was, I couldn’t leave her like this.

Cautiously, I approached her fallen form. She didn’t lash out or try to grab me this time; she just looked up at me with those haunting eyes full of pain and longing. Up close, her desperation was overwhelming—it felt like it could swallow me whole.

Her arm was still bleeding that glowing blue liquid, and I knew she wouldn’t survive much longer if it didn’t stop. Acting on instinct more than anything else, I reached for the wound and carefully exposed what lay beneath her skin: a strange object embedded deep within her flesh.

It wasn’t natural—it pulsed faintly in my hand like it was alive, radiating an ancient power I couldn’t begin to understand. For a moment, I considered keeping it for myself; after all, wasn’t this what I’d come for? But as I looked back at her crumpled form—her tears still falling silently—I knew what I had to do.

With trembling hands, I pressed the object back into her wound and sealed it as best as I could manage. Her body shuddered violently before going still. Her breathing slowed until it became soft and steady—as if she were finally at peace.

I didn’t wait to see what would happen next.

The temple seemed to exhale around me as I fled into its depths once more, leaving her behind in silence. But even as sunlight finally broke through the ruins above and freedom beckoned me forward, her sorrow lingered in my mind—a weight I couldn’t shake.

I had come seeking treasure but left with something far more haunting: the memory of her desperation… and the question that would never stop gnawing at me:

Who—or what—had she been waiting for? And why did it feel like *I* had failed her?
