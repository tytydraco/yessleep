Part 1: 

I was driving home from work when it happened. For months the radio was talking about world war 3. Tensions were high between Russia and the US. Rumors of biological warfare and Armageddon. I heard about it all so much now it had grown dull and numb to me, white noise. Just flip the station to something else, change the channel, tune it out. After a while you couldn’t watch anything without hearing about it. It all seemed pointless and stress inducing. So I stopped listening. Took the blue pill and kept living my life as if nothing was going on. For some time it worked, I lived life like nothing was happening. 

“Hey Tom you hear what they’re sayin on the news this morning” my co-worker said.

Nope, I thought. “I Don’t watch that stuff anymore, it’ll give you a headache” 

“Ha, that’s right” he cracked a smirk at me, “I wish I could stop watching, but what else is there to worry about” 

He went on about some sort of bomb threat and negations that were being made, some trade deal going south? I tuned it all out like I did every day now. It came easy to me at this point. 

“Yea that’s neat Greg, hey give me a hand with this?” I was trying to get a pallet of overloaded ice bags onto my truck, it needed an extra push.

He reared behind the pallet and we both heaved forward to get it over the hump on my lift gate. 

“Thanks”, I said. “That should be it for me, don’t want to be overweight today” 

“Ahhh they never check that shit, once you get to your first stop you’re within DOT regulations anyway!” 

“It’s the drive there that’s illegal, maybe if I cut back on some weight of my own I’d take another pallet” I joked. 

“Cut back on weight?  You’re practically Rambo” Greg exclaimed. 

To clarify, I’m 40 pounds overweight for a 6ft male. But Greg being about the size of the michilin man I probably looked pretty lean to him. I loaded up and set off for my first stop. A liquor store, with the tensions overseas lately we’ve seen a spike in liquor store ice deliveries, I’m sure you can guess why. I’d be stopping there myself every few days too if I’d kept listening to the news. I parked my semi and got out to check in. Entering the store I waved to the clerk which I had just seen the day before. 

“Another pallet of 20 pounders?” I asked. 

“You know it Tom, same spot.” 

I loaded a pallet of 20’s onto my jack and began hauling it to their back cooler. As I and the the power jack silently hummed down the towering shelves of booze I couldn’t help but overhear people clamoring in the isle over from me. 

Drunk guy #1: “Better stock up, I hear it could be anytime this week now!” 

Drunk guy #2: “I ain’t dyin’ sober!” 

They both chuckled clinking bottles into their cart. I tuned it out. Hopeless drunks, I thought. Just turn my ears off. I loaded my ice into the cooler, left them the invoice and went on to the next stop. People shambled the streets as if they were already dead. The city was quieter than usual. Like an old dog preparing for death  many had left to get out of the concrete jungle that was once a bustling metropolis. Leaving their homes empty and desolate. Buildings that once collected happy memories now collecting layers of dust. Businesses with closed signs hung in their doorways. Though I could tune out the television and radio, I could not escape the ever looming effects that they produced on the populace. 

I finished my last stop of the day, another liquor store. Driving back to the terminal I saw a couple sitting on a park bench clutching each other tightly. One of them was visually sobbing as their body lurched back in fourth harmoniously. I winced and kept my eyes on the road. It’s really getting rough out here, I thought. Dogs roamed the streets, their owners seemingly vanished leaving their companions to fend for themselves. 

Arriving back at the terminal, Greg was the only one still there, he liked working long shifts. Probably his way of coping with the doom and gloom. Opening the loading dock doors, he gave me a wave of approval and I backed in to unload all my empty pallets. He didn’t say much other than a casual.

“How’d it go?”

“Same old same old”, I said.

Parking my truck, I ran into him one more time when I went to clock out. 

“I hope they still plan on paying us this week” he scowled. 

“I’m sure they will Greg, the drunks still need their ice, fortunately” 

Punching my time card I grabbed my bag and headed for the door. Turning the handle, Greg stopped me before I could escape his conversational orbit. 

“You think we’ll be alright man? I mean people are freaking out over all this crap, my cousins telling me to head for his cabin up near the Canadian border, says we ain’t got much time left. What do you think Tom? You got an escape plan?”

My escape plan was crawling into a bottle. Work up the courage to taste the gun oil at the end of a barrel, before the radiation kills me. That is if bombs Don’t paint my shadow on the sidewalk first. Trying not to scare him, I said:
 
“oh I dunno, my parents have a place 3 hours out of the cities, maybe I’ll head there.” 

I was not ignorant when it came to the knowledge of nuclear fallout. I’ve seen the images of Chernobyl victims, the effects nukes had on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII. I Don’t want the skin falling off, 3 week death that I assumed most would succumb to if this did all pan out. I’d just end it quick, I thought. Though I knew in the back of mind, I couldn’t. The strong urge to survive to the very last second that most all humans come equipped with prevents this measure. I pushed these thoughts away and told Greg I’d see him tomorrow. I went home and made the dinner of champions. Pot macaroni and a few cold beers. 

I woke up the next day, got dressed, ate something and headed to work. Getting into my truck a 2007 ford f150, rusty enough to stick your arm through the fender wall. I quickly turned off my radio as it would turn on evetime you started it. Before I could reach the “off” button it let out a few alarming words. “-omb threats, power outtag…” I shut it off. Resisting the urge to turn it back on I nervously shifted into “drive” and headed off for work. As long as I keep with my schedule I’ll be ok. It being a type of coping mechanism at this point. 

I arrived at work, no one was there. The lights were out and I could not clock in. I wrote my hours down on my time sheet and went to load my truck. When I entered the ice cooler all the pallets were dripping with dew. It must have shut off a few hours ago. I loaded my truck up, the cooler in my trailer bringing the pallets back to freezing temperature I set off for my first stop. My route was not showing up as I had no wifi. I pressed on, I knew my stops by heart as I worked for this company for years. I arrived at Walmart, ready to unload but no one was there to receive. The whole building was shut down and the parking lot was a ghost town. My mind refusing to bend and break to the reality of the situation at hand I went on to my next stop. Same story, nobody home, lights out. I went to every stop on my memorized route to find everyone closed except for a small gas station on the edge of town. They were running off a generator and the only person on staff was the owner. We knew each other.  

“Holland, what’s going on you’re the only place on my route that’s not closed” I said as I got out of my truck. He met my lax attitude and said:

“Everyone’s gone Tom, left town, went home, hugging their loved ones. Didn’t you hear the news this morning?” 

“You know I Don’t listen to that, it’s all gibberish and white lies until it actually happens.” 

“Well… I think it’s actually happening Tom, all the news stations are down, we’re in a state of emergency, ordered to take shelter, you’re my only delivery man that showed up today. Hell, I haven’t had a single customer, figured I’d stay open so no one would rob the place.” 

The panic I had been holding in for months now seemed to be tearing at the seams attempting to boil over. 

“Well, ya need any ice.” I could only manage to squeak out. 

“Uh… No Tom, I think I’m good. You should probably head home man, got any family? Might want to spend some precious time with them.” 

“I got my cat… and… well that’s about it. Got some family a few hours north of here but that’s all.” 

“Well I recommend you start headed that way. I got a feeling things won’t be so pleasant here for very long.” 

“Yea Holland, thanks, you take care.” 

I crawled into my cab and headed back to the terminal. My mind in a trance, unable to strand together the series of events unfolding before me. I arrived back at the terminal and began to unload robotically. As I entered our ice freezer all the pallets were dripping violently and the floor was wet with water. I unloaded my truck anyway and got set to go home. Recording my hours on my time card, I locked up and got into my truck. 

About a mile from my house the tornado sirens began wailing. I reluctantly turned on the radio for the first time since all of this started, a motion I was no longer familiar with. The radio statically crackled to an audible tune. It immediately began playing a heart wrenching sound of an emergency line, the triple dial tone followed by a monotone voice, “elter immediately, this is not a drill, errr…errr…errr… the following tri state areas ————— are under immediate duress, find shelter, ensure you have heat, stock up on supplies, seek shelter immediately, this is not a drill, Errr…Errr… “ The radio cut out, and then my engine, with it the sirens sung their last song and reeled down to a quiet slumber. I came to a chugging hault a few blocks from my house. 

I sat there momentarily, white knuckles gripping my steering wheel. I hadn’t seen another car on the road all day, I could no longer go through the motions. I could no longer ignore the elephant in the room. Frozen, I sat there. Waiting for nothing. I looked up into the sky which had gone from a cool natural blue to a dark grey cloud that engulfed the entire horizon. This is it I thought, the jig is up,
the game is over. My judgment day has come. Urging my stiff body to move I finally unbuckled my seat belt, jerked the door open and stepped out with a bold stride. No door alarm sounded, my truck was dead quiet as was I. Taking heavy steps I marched towards my house, determined to continue my regiment lifestyle. My work boots thudding on the concrete before me slightly echoing off the tall buildings that lined the street beside was the only sound I could hear. Utter silence. 

I covered about half a block when I heard it. Like a trumpet, a loud groaning boom echoed from above. White clouds of smoke gleamed overhead covering every inch of the sky. I kept marching. Then the chill set in. Subtle at first but grew stronger with every step I took. Soon I could see my own breath, odd for a late July night. Then I could feel the cold, like walking into a meat freezer, goosebumps on my skin, my hair stood upright. I crossed my arms in retaliation but it kept coming. One block from my house now. I picked up a light jog as my limbs began to freeze. It kept decreasing In temperature, it had to be -30 Fahrenheit by now. I broke into a sprint as I approached my front door. Swinging it open I stepped in, welcomed with a whoosh of warm air. I closed the door swiftly as crystals quickly formed on the window pane before me. 

I wasn’t sure what exactly was going on. The temperature had dropped so quickly outside, I had a sinking feeling in my chest. Pulling my phone out of my pocket and checking, it was dead, my lights wouldn’t turn on either. I wanna guess EMP strike, but what about the cold air outside, cryogenic warfare? I wondered if this happening nationwide. What happened to just dropping a good old nuke and being done with things. Maybe this was more humane. better freezing to death than have your skin boil off. 

Feeling the cold air beginning to make its way inside I prepared, putting on all my winter clothes. Leggings, pants, snow pants, 2 layers of wool socks, snow boots, 3 layers of t-shirts, a sweater, winter gloves and a heavy snow coat. I wrapped my face in scarfs and put a wool hat on. My apartment had grown so cold I could feel my eyes freezing. I put on some snowboarding goggles I had in the closet. It wasn’t enough. Boozer, my cat was meowing incessantly as she paced between my legs. I picked her up and shoved her into my jacket close to my chest, zipping it up she began to vibrate like a little heater. My neighbor had a fireplace and I knew they had left town weeks ago. I am going to have to go over there. Bracing my self I busted out of my front door into the winter-like atmosphere. This was beyond any January night I had ever experienced. Immediately I was sapped of any heat I had retained under my heavy clothing. As if I had just plunged into a frozen lake. I quickly made my way to the neighbors door only to find it locked. In a moment of desperation I backed up and threw myself at the door. It gave way in the first blow with a loud splintering crack. I fell to the floor landing on my side in their vacant hallway. 

Collecting myself I stood up and found my way to their fireplace. My hands now shaking with frozen nerve damage. I stacked a crude kindling pile in the center of the pit. I had no lighter. Clamoring around their fireplace I found a box of matches. There were 5 left in the container, each coated with a fresh layer of frost, I attempted to strike every single one only finding redemption in the last stick. I shakily held it to the kindling pile praying it would not go out. Flame climbing up the short shaft of the match nearly reaching my finger, then. The stack of thin wood took flame, quickly hovering over it with the protective instinct a mother would have over a newborn infant, I began holding my rigid fingers over it. The flames wrapping around my hands and dancing between my digits. I was able to feel again. The warmth was barely enough to thaw my extremities. Quickly burning through the small pile of logs beside the fire, I began breaking down wood furniture to keep the fire going. Every time I left the presence of the flames to gather more kindling my body went numb. 

It was about 3 am when I had consumed every flammable item in the apartment and stacked my reserves next to the fireplace. It was enough for the night. I jammed as many books and pieces of wood possible into the fire, curled up next to it with about 4 blankets atop me and fell asleep. I woke about 3 hours later to a small smoldering pile of ash and my breath freezing in the air. I quickly stacked the rest of my kindling atop the embers and began thinking of a game plan. I have no vehicle, leaving this heat source leads to a bone chilling death, I have no fuel left, I have about an hour… with every minute I sat there I began brainstorming with the precious time dwindling. 

I resided about two miles from a small hospital. If anything was still functioning, if anyone was still alive out there, that’s where I would find them. Maybe the oil heaters were still functioning and I would be welcomed by the warm embrace of doctors and nurses. Doubtful. I was certain the few people left in this city had begun looking out for themselves long ago. But still, it was worth a shot, it was my only shot. I began thinking of the fastest route there. If I cut through a few alleyways and back yards I could half the distance to get there. With the fire already dying out again I had to get moving before I had no warmth to work with. I pulled the collar of my jacket forward to find my cat still peacefully resting inside. She looked up at me and blinked slowly. She was keeping my chest warm, I needed her just as much as she needed me. I thought of grabbing some quick supplies but, everything was frozen of course. I hadn’t eaten or drank anything since yesterday and was starting to feel its effects whey on me. I grabbed the blankets I had spent the night with and hung them around my shoulders like a cape, a little added warmth might be what gets me there in one piece. It was time, I approached the front door that was now sealed shut with frost.

This is how I die, I thought. Slamming my shoulder into the door, it did not budge. I collected myself and went running at the door slamming into it even harder. The frost sealing me in gave way allowing the door to open about an inch. I could feel the tundra air wafting in to the already freezing hallway. I grabbed a metal leg from a table I had torn apart the night before. Using it in a prying motion I jammed it into the doorway and heaved. The door budged a little more. I was like a man trying to tear into his own coffin. I grabbed the door and it seemed to have some give now. Creaking and groaning, I opened it enough to slip outside. There was a haze in the air, like morning fog. There was no snow on the ground, instead a layer of grayish soot covered everything and as I took my first few steps it puffed up into the air causing my boots to be covered in the stuff. I picked up a hustled jog as I began my route to the hospital. Slipping down my first alleyway numbness already joining me. Beginning at my toes and hands. Another alleyway, then a backyard. The tingling feeling climbing up my arms and legs. Not a soul in site.

A dog layed curled up beside a building covered in the dust, it did not move. I kept jogging, my muscles screaming in pain from the cold. It felt like I had cramps all over my body. Halfway there now. I bolted down another alleyway and then a street. A Volkswagen sat stationary at an intersection. I could see two people in the front seat hugging each other. As I got closer I noticed they weren’t moving. I shuttered. The thought of that being me very soon shook me to my core. My body was now beyond freezing. I lost all feeling in my hands. I couldn’t even make a fist anymore. My feet felt like they weren’t my own as each foot I put in front of the other was now a guided act that I had no control over. I rounded the final turn, my jog turning into a drudgingly slow walk as my body and joints began to seize. My lungs burning with each and every inhale of chilling air I took in. The hospital stood before me. 

One story tall and made of brick with few windows, it looked like a little prison. A prison with… one light on, coming from the basement window flickering away.  I was ignited with hope again, swinging one leg in front of the other. I covered the stretch of road, and then the sidewalk. Approaching the front doors I could barely wrap my hand around the handle. Tried as I might it did not open, they were locked, of course. Before I left I thought about this, my game plan would be to go around back or climb in through a window, but I didn’t have the energy anymore, I was frozen. My body was slipping into a catatonic state. I underestimated the severity of this cryogenic frost that befell the city. My legs buckled and I collapsed, knees slamming into the concrete but my pain receptors were unable to pick up the signal. Then I fell to my side, the soot engulfing me in a cloud of dust that I choked on. My body refusing to move anymore. 

Well, not the worst way to go. Could’ve been shittier, I thought. The numbness has all but reached my chest, where my cat was still laying. She let out a meek, “meow”. The last thoughts I had were of my family, my parents and if they’re still alive. My brother and his family, were they ok? I hadn’t called any of them in weeks. I had grown distant over the past few months. The stress of all that was going on, I had isolated myself. My cat adjusted under my stiff coat. She was going to freeze with the rest of me. I closed my eyes for the last time listening to the silence all around me, soaking it in, a sweet melody. The only thing that the cold couldn’t steal. My body began shutting down. I kept listening, the silence was so comforting and warm, no sirens, no traffic or honking, planes taking off or landing… Just… utter silence… and the sound of the hospital doors swinging open.
