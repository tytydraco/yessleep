So, when I was younger, I watched Jaystation, Stromedy, basically, most 3am clickbait YouTubers. For some reason, I actually believed in them. I was a very dumb kid. There were the obvious signs, but I seemed to ignore them. I was too engrossed in the actual video.

One night, me and my sister wanted to stay up till 3 o'clock to see if these videos were real. We decided to talk about random stuff and watch shows on demand. Yes, I grew up on cable. We also wanted to use my tablet to record anything we saw.

We pretended to sleep until our mother and father went to sleep in their room, because they always kept their door open, and their room had direct line of sight of the living room, which we were in.

After a bit, probably around 11, we decided to get up and check the house. We went into my room. Nothing. Bathroom. Nothing. Backroom. Nothing. Every room was clear. My sister decided it was stupid, and all fake, and went to sleep in her own room, mostly from boredom and being tired, though she wouldn't admit to being weak. I wanted to stay up longer because I believed in the paranormal and wouldn't give up like her. I needed hard proof that 3 was the witching hour.

I had a FNaF style set up. I was in the middle of the room, flashlight in my right hand, flashing the hallway and the backroom. I was really into FNaF at that time, and wanted to be in a real life scenario like it. I didn't expect something like that to come true, though...

I fell asleep at around 1, bundled up in a blanket and everything silent, other than the TV. I dreamed about many things, but the only one I remember vividly, is the one where all I see is a generic, red monster.

I woke up around 2 or 3, really sweaty for some reason, and stood up. I checked the bathroom. Nothing. My room. Nothing. I checked up on my sister. Still asleep. But when I got to the backroom, my heart SANK...

Next to the counter and cat food, stood the same red monster I saw in my dream. It was one of those moments like, "It's funny until it happens to you." I couldn't believe what I saw. I thought it was my eldest sister playing games with me, so I walked up to it very slowly.

"\[Sister's name\] this isn't funny..." "\[Sister's name\] please tell me that's you..." I kept saying these over and over again. The creature never looked at me. It seemed so ominous, yet, obvious. It kept staring at a 45 degree angle towards me, above my head, at the cabinets. I stopped about 6 inches away from it and looked at it's face. Red skin. Big, beady, black eyes. Sharp teeth. Spikes on it's back, running along it's spine. The whole thing was like it was in a children's story book.

I can't remember what happened after it, but I know for sure it wasn't a dream. It couldn't have. I felt each step, the light breeze coming from the backroom. I felt everything. My sister said it was all in my head, but one night, before she told me this, I told her about it. She kept telling me to stop because she was scared, so I decided to exaggerate a little, and finish the story by saying our sister was inside of it, playing a prank on me.

Nobody believes me inside of my family. I hope you enjoyed reading my own personal horror story, because I know living it wasn't very enjoyable. Lol.
