Two hundred thousand dollars, six months, cash up front.

When I saw the offer, my first thought wasn't "scam!", it was salvation. That money would clear my gambling debts and make those thugs disappear from my mother’s doorway forever. So I signed without hesitation. The contract stressed "absolute isolation." Food and water were already stocked. The only contact was a bi-monthly supply drop.

For a guy who wanted to evaporate, this felt tailor-made.

The helicopter that dropped me off treated me like garbage. The pilot’s eyes didn't hold pity; they looked at me like a piece of meat already placed in the freezer. Lookout Tower #7: a rickety metal can perched on a mountain peak, groaning in the wind. It was so high, I had no intention of ever climbing down.

The former lookout didn't leave much. But carved into the desk, deep enough to almost punch through the wood, were four words: YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

I thought it was about the recruitment company’s lies. Then I pulled out the empty drawer and found the crumpled, sweat-stained piece of paper.

\*\* The Five Protocols of Lookout Tower #7 \*\*

1. Every night at exactly 12:00 AM, the entrance and all windows must be locked. Draw the curtains. Be precise.
2. Never respond to any cries for help. No matter how desperate they sound, they are not human.
3. If the radio starts playing jazz music outside of communication hours, immediately cut the main power to the tower. Wait ten minutes in complete darkness and silence. Don't make a sound.
4. Never look directly at any reflection that appears on the window glass at night. It is not entirely you.
5. In the food storage room, only eat the blue-labeled cans. The red-labeled ones are not for us.

I laughed, pinning the list to the wall as a piece of dark humor from my predecessor.

The first month, I lived like a dead man walking. Daytimes were spent staring at the forest, sometimes greeting a one-eyed crow I called "Blackie" who landed on the railing at 3 PM every day. The radio never worked; it only hissed static, a broken piece of junk. I hoped I'd never need it. Everything was quiet.

Until I broke the first rule.

I’d won a round of solitaire against myself and had a few too many cups of instant coffee. The broken wall clock was chiming midnight when I realized I was late. I rushed to lock the door, but missed one window curtain. As I turned...

I saw it.

It was a thing. Not a beast, not a ghost, but a mistake. It stood on the forest's edge like a stretched, twisted black inkblot. Its limbs were distorted at angles that defied anatomy, its head cocked sideways. It was still... but I knew it was watching me. My buzz evaporated instantly. I scrambled to pull the curtain shut. My heart hammered against my ribs like a caged bird trying to escape.

From that night on, I stopped laughing. I considered leaving, but I knew I couldn't make it to civilization before dark. Staying here, despite the terror, was my only safe option.

A few nights later, I woke up to screaming. A woman’s voice, raw and frantic. "Help... is anyone there... save me..." My hand froze an inch from the radio. Rule number two was burned into my mind. I didn't dare respond. I shut off the lights, and huddled in the corner like a coward. The wailing went on for almost an hour, then abruptly turned into a low, satisfied chuckle. It sounded like it was pressed directly against the steel structure of the tower.

It knew I was listening.

The threat escalated. One afternoon, the radio came to life on its own, blasting cheerful 1930s jazz, laced with vinyl static. My blood turned to ice. As the tower lights began to flicker like a dying heart, I dove for the main breaker. I pulled the lever with all my strength. The world went black. Then I heard it. A wet, heavy sound, slowly dragging itself across the glass of the observation deck windows. Viscous. Slow. Ten minutes in that darkness felt longer than the last thirty years of my life.

The second supply drop came at the end of the second month. The helicopter dropped the crate nearby and immediately flew off without even waving. My heart sank. I was stuck here. I hauled the supplies into the storage room. At the bottom of the empty crate, I saw it. A single red-labeled can. It was placed carefully under a layer of foam, like a reminder.

My blood ran cold. The supplies weren't just for me. They were for that thing too.

Just when I thought I’d gotten used to dealing with the things outside, rule number four shattered my reality.

That night, I unconsciously glanced up. And I saw the reflection on the glass. I immediately snapped my head away, but that glimpse was enough.

The "me" in the reflection was smiling. It was a smile I was incapable of... one filled with pure, unadulterated malice.

The nature of the fear changed completely. I covered most of the windows and walked around staring at the floor. The thing in the reflection was waiting for me to make eye contact again. I knew if I did, it would find a way in.

This made me obsess over Rule Five. The red-labeled cans were still in storage. Who were they for? The true terror hit on a stormy night when I woke up and found one red can missing. The doors were locked, the windows intact. Something had been inside and taken its food while I slept.

The fourth month's resupply was agonizing.

The helicopter came and dropped the box. It left as quickly as the first time. I dragged the crate in, and at the bottom, there was the same unsettling sight: another single red-labeled can, a cruel little gift.

Today, is the last day of my contract. I stayed up all night.

When the sound of the rotors finally grew close, I felt no joy, just numb relief. I watched the helicopter land. A man in a uniform waved, and his voice boomed through the loudspeaker, "Alex! We're here to take you home! Open up!"

I rushed to the door, my hand grabbing the handle. But my eyes fell on the old, wrinkled paper. Faintly written under the original five rules, I saw a line I'd never noticed before.

Rule Six: When you think you are rescued, do not open the door. Imitation is its specialty.

I slowly backed away. After a few minutes, the voice outside changed. The warm call became a high-pitched, metallic shriek. "....open.... the door.... Al... ex..." The banging made the entire tower shudder. I knew the structure wouldn't hold. I couldn't open the door, but I couldn't wait to die either.

I grabbed my backpack. I smashed the observation window and slid down the rusty fire escape ladder. I didn't get far before I heard the entire lookout tower groan and collapse behind me. I ran without looking back, pouring every ounce of adrenaline into my legs.

I ran all night until I collapsed, covered in mud. A forestry ranger found me the next morning. They said I was delirious, clutching a crumpled paper. They said I was hallucinating.

But I know the truth. I survived. I'm free.

But it’s not over.

I rented a small apartment in the city, but my life hasn't returned to normal. My paranoia has bled into every single day. I only allow myself to eat blue-labeled cans now. It has become my personal standard of safety. Every few days, I conduct a quick, fully-clothed "procurement ritual" at different grocery stores. I must find that specific "blue" can and make sure there are no red labels hidden on the shelves.

I smashed all the mirrors in my apartment and keep the curtains drawn. Yet, I can still feel it. It wasn't trapped in that tower. It followed me home.

Now, I'm sitting here typing this. My cell phone... the device I thought was safe, the link to the civilized world... just went off by itself.

It's 1930s jazz. It’s using the only alarm I understand to remind me.

Remember the paper. I've taped it to my fridge now, replacing every shopping list. Don't believe anything you see, and don't believe anything you hear. In this situation, that list is the only thing you can trust.
