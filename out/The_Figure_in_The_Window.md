So, a few years ago me and my parents moved from Alaska to Texas. Yes big move, that took a week since we drove down here(Texas). 

  
Everything was going pretty well, we were settling into our apartment, getting me enrolled into school, figuring everything out. But one night something weird/strange happened.   
Around 12-2am I woke up and got up and out of bed to get a glass of ice water from the kitchen, now the way my old apartment was arranged had the kitchen across from the living room so I had to pass the glass sliding doors that led to the patio. I started walking past the sliding doors to get to the kitchen but all of a sudden I heard a noise, like something hitting glass, I looked over at the patio door, expecting to see a bird or something but through the panels of the blinds I see a shadow pressed against the glass patio door, a towering shadow humanoid figure, it had large black sockets where the eyes should be and a big joker smile.

  
 I quickly moved back into the hallway of my room trying not to panic and trying to rationalize what I saw. I tried convincing myself that it was just my overactive imagination, I knew that when it was dark and hard to see things, my brain would mess with me. after a minute or two of trying to calm down, I stepped back out and looked at the patio door, hoping the shadow was gone, but no it was still there and the smile it had started to look even more malicious then before like it wanted me to see it, whatever was there looked humanoid, like a tall man with a slight elongated face. 

  
I really started to panic now, it was still there, it wasn’t just my brain messing with me, something really was there and it was staring at me. 

  
I immediately and quickly walked to my parents room and woke them up and explained what I saw, they got up and my dad went to go properly check the patio while I stayed in their room and went more in-depth with my mom.   


my dad came back after a minute or two, when he checked nothing was there, nothing, no bird, no person no strange creature. He assumed it was just an owl that accidentally flew into the window and got stuck for a little before flying away. so we all went back to bed, I had a hard time falling back asleep, I was still thinking about that ‘owl’, part of me wasn’t convinced it was just an owl, the figure had looked too large for an owl, it’s face looked too human for an owl, the body looked too human for an owl. 

My brain was racing with too many thoughts, I couldn’t sleep. At some point in my sleep deprived state I looked out the window, I could’ve sworn I saw tiny beady glowing yellow dots in between a small gap between the window frame and the panels of the blinds.   


to this day I still don’t know what I truly saw that night, but that malicious joker smiling face still haunts my dreams sometimes.
