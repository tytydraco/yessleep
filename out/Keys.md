Still early in my job within the prison system, I had managed to put the events of the Perimeter Check in the back of my mind. Sometimes in this line of work you have to be able to mentally push past the trauma of the things that may occur. It can give you a cold demeanor at times, but the outward appearance doesn’t match what’s going on inside. It’s just something you do so that you can have a clear head when something happens, and you can respond accordingly.

I had befriended the old hand who saved me that night. For the sake of his privacy and safety we’ll just call him “Johnson”.

Not long after the perimeter incident, I was back to work. I had been working inside of what we call “dorm housing” where the inmates are housed in single man cubicles. This was a very easy area of the facility to work in, and I was put here to “take it easy for a while” as the supervisors put it. I didn’t protest this decision, I appreciated it. Most of the staff who worked out here would work it often and I had gotten to know them a little better which is never a bad thing. This housing area has a very long corridor with two turns in it. Making the first turn you can see two of the housing areas, and at the second turn are the other two areas. In the middle of all this is a control room where the doors can be opened by the officer inside and a door that separates both sides of the corridor.

On this day, I offered to work some overtime since the night shift needed some extra assistance. When the night shift arrived, I was informed I would still be in the same building, but I would be manning the corridor to secure the doors to the housing areas after they were opened. I used to wonder why the night shift always had tired faces, as if they never slept. After my encounter I could only imagine what they would witness that would keep them awake.

As I began my duties, I was given a set of instructions by the relieving staff that if I hear keys coming down the hallway then I should get to the center doorway and open it quickly. When I asked why, I was told it would keep the night peaceful. I didn’t know what that meant at the time, but I would soon find out in the worse way.

At approximately 0117 hours, I was in the first half of the hallway sorting paperwork when I heard it. At first it was a faint jingle, but it began to grow louder as it reached me. It was the definite sound of keys, as if someone were walking right past me, but there was nobody there. A cold wind brushed past me and caused the hair on the back of my neck to stand on end. I listened as the sound made it’s way down the first turn and kept going. Suddenly remembering the instructions I was given I ran fast towards the center door but I didn’t make it in time to open it. The jingling stopped right in front of the door. I stopped running and just watched. Nothing happened… As I approached the door it began to shake violently causing me to stumble backwards and fall. A very loud pounding also started, and the door shook even harder with each hit. The echo down my side of the corridor was deafening.

Suddenly I heard the shouting of men. Angry voices that sounded almost demonic. The voices were deafening, and I put my hands to my ears. I was still able to hear their screams of rage. “Get him” … these were the only two words I was able to make out amidst all the screaming. Then a new scream came out from the group. This one being a painful tortured scream. This new scream was the worse one. It got louder and louder until it drowned out the others. The door continued to shake, and the walls as well.

I opened my eyes, and I could see the officer inside of the control room pounding on the window and pointing at the door. I knew I needed to open the door. I stood up and ran fast towards the door while fumbling with the keys I had. It felt like an eternity, but I finally found the right key and got the door opened. The moment the door opened the sounds disappeared. I stood dumbfounded… Where did the sounds go? I didn’t realize how heavy I was breathing. I didn’t notice the cold sweat I was doused in, as if I had walked underneath a waterfall.

The housing areas all had large windows near the entrances and inside each window there were inmates staring. Not in fear, not in anger, just blank stares, knowing stares. They knew I didn’t get to the door on time. The officer in the control room opened the door and stared at me for what felt like an eternity. I finally understood those tired eyes. As she looked at me, she said “This is why we open that door”. Before I could speak, she closed the door and locked it.

All the inmates had turned in for the night after this. Nothing further happened on this night.

After being relieved, I went home, knowing I wouldn't be able to sleep. The events replaying in my head over and over until eventually my mind settled with it, and I finally drifted off.

I came to work the next day visibly tired, and before the shift could be briefed, I looked for Mr. Johnson. He was sitting by himself as he always did. I sat next to him, and he looked at me. “You didn’t open the door on time, did you?” he asked. I shook my head, and he sat in silence. “What was all that?” I asked him. He breathed in deep and sighed.

“Prisons ain’t just for the living”. He said to me. “Wicked souls also have to serve when their time comes”. I sat silently and let him continue. “He was a volatile supervisor by the name of Smith. He was hell on two feet and he was dangerous. No reports were written against him either out of intimidation or just outright fear. His method of manipulating reports to justify the pain he would inflict always kept him out of trouble, and on night shift there was limited staff to witness his actions. The inmates feared him until one night in 1989. They made the decision that he had to go and planned to take care of him themselves. As he rounded the first corner in the corridor one of the housing area doors popped open after an inmate had manipulated it earlier in the day to make it appear closed. As soon as it happened, a mob of inmates ran through and began chasing him. The center door was secured, and he couldn’t get through. He pounded on that door and the corridor shook. All staff heard was shouting and weren’t able to get through the crowd of inmates until it was all said and done. When they found him, his body was broken. He had been swarmed, beaten and stomped on until he quit screaming, and then they beat him some more for good measure. That happened at 1:17am".

“Now he has to serve his time reliving that night over and over again. Staff open the door because they don’t want to hear those final screams of his. An act of mercy for him that he never gave to anyone else. It doesn’t matter either way. His wickedness caught up to him and that’s the devil he has to pay”.

As he stood up to leave, he said to me "respect goes a long way in this place. It's the only thing most of these men have. It can make the day go by smoothly, it can open doors to great opportunities, and it can also mean the difference between life and death. Without it, you'll have your own devil to pay".
