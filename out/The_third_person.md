I live alone, but there are three toothbrushes in my bathroom.

That’s not a metaphor or some weird art project. I have one toothbrush. A blue one. I’ve always used blue. But two weeks ago, I noticed a red toothbrush in the holder next to mine. I assumed it was a leftover from the last tenant or something I forgot about.

I threw it away.

Two days later, the red toothbrush was back.

Clean. Damp.

I thought maybe I was losing it—stress, lack of sleep, whatever. I started locking my bedroom door at night just in case. I live in a one-bed flat. No flatmates, no pets. No one has a spare key.

Then came the mug.

A chipped white mug appeared next to my sink one morning. Inside was the end of a cigarette—wet and half-smoked. I don’t smoke. Never have.
My windows were locked. The door was locked.
I checked the building’s CCTV.

There was nothing.

No one had entered or left in over 48 hours.

Then things got worse.

A week ago, I woke up to the sound of breathing.

Not mine.

It was low, shallow, raspy. It wasn’t coming from outside. It was in the room.

I couldn’t move. My body froze like it was trapped in glue. Just this feeling of absolute wrongness in the air. After what felt like forever, I managed to flick on the lamp.

No one was there.

But on the wall, drawn in something greasy, were two handprints. High up. Like someone had stood on my bed and leaned over me while I slept.


I called the police. They searched the place top to bottom. Nothing. No signs of forced entry. No evidence of anyone else. They told me it was probably “stress-related hallucinations.”

But the handprints were real.

I didn’t sleep the next night. I stayed up watching every corner of the flat, waiting for something to move.

At 3:42AM, my kitchen tap turned on.

Not all the way. Just a slow, quiet trickle. I walked over, heart slamming, turned it off, and as I looked up into the window above the sink, I saw the reflection of a man standing behind me.

Shaved head. No eyebrows. Wide, wet eyes.

When I spun around—nothing.

But the floor was wet.

Here’s the worst part. The part that makes me feel like I’ve already gone too far to get out.

Last night, I set up my phone camera in my room while I slept. Just to prove to myself that this was real. That I’m not crazy.

I watched the footage this morning.

At 2:17AM, the bedroom door opens slowly.

A man walks in. Quietly. Confident. Like he’s done it a hundred times. He stands over me for eleven minutes. Just breathing. Watching.

Then, and I swear to you I almost threw up, he looks directly into the camera.

He knows.

He knew it was recording.

And the very last frame, just before the footage cuts out,he leans down to my ear and whispers:

“You’re the third one.”

I’ve left the flat. But I didn’t tell anyone where I was going. Didn’t post online. Didn’t use my bank card.

And somehow—somehow—this morning when I woke up in the cheap motel I paid cash for, the red toothbrush was already in the bathroom.

And now there are four.
