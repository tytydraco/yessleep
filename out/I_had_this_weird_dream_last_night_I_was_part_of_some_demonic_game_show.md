I had this incredibly weird dream last night. I was part of some sort of game show for this Demon? He was a bit eccentric at times and it went a little something like this.

HELLO ONE AND ALL AND WELCOME TO RAZAROTH’S GAME!! 

Let’s welcome Susan as this week’s contestant. Immediately a tumultuous roll of thundering applause erupts from the crowd and a single person is shimmed onto the stage. Lights blaring into my eyes so I couldn’t see much at first. Until whoever was ushering me forward stopped as I was right in front of the show’s Host. All of the stage lights converged on us and I could just make out bits and pieces of the surroundings. A large studio audience was in front of us, but I couldn’t make out any of the faces. There didn’t seem to be any video cameras and next to me was an abnormally tall man. He had to be at least 3 meters tall. 

Just as I finished taking this brief look the man next to me started talking. “Hello one and all! Welcome to this week’s episode of Razaroth’s Game!! This week we have a new contestant for all of you lovely folks and their name is Susan.” The crowd immediately erupted into another loud burst of applause. “So my lovely audience, how do you think she will do? Do you think she will make it past round one?” Jeers and snickers almost immediately started answering back. “Well, well, well little lady looks like the crowd doesn’t think much of you, huh?”
Confused by everything going on I wasn’t sure if this was my cue to talk or not, but a feeble, “I guess so.” Escaped my lips. 

The Host then bent forward and got close to my face and for the first time I could actually make out what he looked like. I instinctively flinched backwards at what I saw, He had a goat’s skull for a head and what seemed to be fire behind his eye sockets. When he opened his mouth there wasn’t your normal darkness, but it almost seemed like it was an endless void…..and where the horns should have been were two human hands writhing with each move he made. He just looked at me for a moment before whispering. “Come on kid, this is my game show not yours. I will let you know when it’s your turn to talk.”

With that he shot back up and continued to rally the crowd .”We got a lively one this week folks, so how about we start right along with round 1?” A silence instantly formed across the crowd. “Let’s bring out the wheel!” Ominous music started playing as an enormous wheel rose from the stage in front of us. It was just as tall as the host with wedges with a single word on it. Some of them had things like darkness and heights on them. “Alright little lady it’s your turn to shine, step on up and give the wheel a spin.” As I started to walk up to the wheel I looked at the host and asked. “What is going to happen?” He simply responded with a “Well obviously you are going to spin the wheel and it will land on an activity silly.” 

Getting closer to the wheel I could see more of the prompts; loss, dysmorphia, spiders, and even death. I took a deep breath and pulled the wheel hoping to get anything good. However as the wheel kept spinning and started to slow I was able to see more and more of the prompts. All of the prompts had to do with fears and slowly it started to land on snakes. “Oohhhh look at that my ghosts and ghouls, we have snakes as our first round! How exciting!” The crowd had mixed feelings on this however. “That’s it!” “We had that 3 weeks ago” “Snakes are always fun” “Who doesn’t love a god snake round” “Are we sure this show isn’t in a rut” 


At the exact moment that last statement was uttered our host’s eyes flicked right to that audience member. Lifted a single finger and poof he was gone in a cloud of blood and dust. “Now, now my beloved audience, I think we are going a bit too far with that. DON’T YOU THINK!?” With the last part of his statement coming out both sharp and firm. However instead of panic in the audience laughs and cheers roared through. “You got them good Razaroth” “Yeah show em who's boss around here” and almost as quickly as it started it ended and all eyes were on me.

“Now shall we begin our first round!” Almost instantly I was transported into another location. It started taking shape right before my eyes. I started in a dark room followed by the 4 walls falling down and continuing into different shapes and masses as it formed the area around me. Slowing down only at the end when it completed its construction. Surrounding me was an entire amusement park and directly in front of me was a ring toss…except the rings looked odd. However before I could look further the host was back, but this time dressed in a new outfit to match the carnival theme. He even wore a top hat that had slits for his ugh… hands. 

“Welcome, come one, come all to the Snake Toss! Rules are simple here, you take a ring and you toss it. Get it on one of the stakes and you get a point. Simple right? But here is the tricky part: you have to get 3 points and you only have 5 tries.” Without even waiting for an answer he tossed me a ring and to my horror I was right. It was a live snake biting its tail like an ouroboros. In a panic I dropped the ring and heard a loud “DING” Looking around I couldn’t find the source at first, but then when I looked back at the host between his two hands on his head was a neon sign. On one side it had a 0 while on the other it had a 1. Immediately I knew what this meant. I didn’t have the luxury to mess around anymore. I would have to score these points with only room for one error now.

A smile exploded on the host's face as he realized that I was going to just play his game without contesting. Then again if I didn’t, what’s to say he wouldn’t just vaporize me like that audience member? I walked up to the bucket where all the rings were, Rattles and hisses emanated out of it. As I shakingly stuck my hand in to grab one. The smooth scaly skin made me jump back as I realized just how difficult this was going to be for me. Then instinctually as if my body was trying to protect itself I muttered. “What no gloves, haha.” With a weak half hearted smile

The host didn’t seem angry this time, rather amused. So he pulled out another snake ring, ripped its head from its tail and uttered this.” You want gloves? Gloves for the snake trail? Okay I’ll give you gloves, but you need to do something to earn them. Take this snake and eat it alive. Then and only then will I give you a pair of gloves.” I almost threw up at the thought of it. “I can’t do that, I can barely touch them, but now you want me to eat one?” The words slipped out of my mouth before I could stop them. To which the smile returned and proceeded to get even larger on the host. “No I didn’t expect you to eat this, I just wanted you to play my game. You're the one who is trying to get extra little help out of it and little one” He got close once again. “Nothing in this game is for free.”

With that I attempted to muster up enough courage to put my hand in the bucket again. The sounds definitely weren't helping, but slowly I could at least touch a snake ring without jumping back. It seemed like I didn’t have a time limit for this game and I didnt want to ask so I just took the time I needed. This was the only way I was going to be able to do this. The stakes weren’t far away and there were at least 50 of them. So I had decent odds right? I pulled out a ring, took a deep breath and threw it. “DING” The Scoreboard now said 0, 2. This was going to be more difficult than I thought.

“Oh look at that folks things just got a bit more interesting” The scoreboard for just a fraction of a moment seemed to turn to a sign that read “Cheer” before it snapped back to normal. The crowd followed suit and filled the carnival with their boisterous cheering. “How am I supposed to do this?” I thought I was thinking this but it seemed I spoke the words out loud. The host without skipping a beat cocked his head and looked down on me. “Well obviously by getting a bit creative now. We wouldn’t want this week’s contestant to fail on the first stage, now would we folks?” Yelling back the crowd answered in unison “No, not another short episode.”

“Episode? What do they mean by episode?” I asked “Oh I wouldn’t worry about that now. You have more pressing matters to worry about don’t you? I’ll tell you what, since I’m such a generous host, if you make it past this round I might answer your question.” How am I going to do this…How am I going to get creative…How can I beat this twisted game. These three things kept pounded into my head over and over like a mantra. Until only one idea crossed my mind. I walked up to the bucket and a final hail mary tossed all of the snake rings towards the stakes. 

“DING” “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING”  “DING” “DING” “DING” 

The scoreboard now read 15, 39. “Well look at that we have a…WINNER!!” The crowd erupted into an ear splitting cheering. The ground around me almost immediately started shifting and pulsing. Underneath me a sinkhole formed and I was transported back to the set I started on, the host next to me and the live audience outstretched in front of me. Except this time the lights weren’t as harsh and I could make out some of the audience members. They were…hideous, disfigured bodies, some with limbs barely holding on. Others you could look straight through, with a ghastly aura around them. Just as I was trying to scan through the members, a hard SMACK on my back regained my attention. 

“Well look at that, you were able to make it past the first round. Congratulations are in order. Everyone, let's celebrate this week’s contest win.” The crowd did exactly as they were told and all I could do was stare at the host. “What is going on here?” I asked sheepishly “Now, now you keep asking questions and I already told you I might answer another. Now you want to know more?” His large smile returned to his face. “Well if that’s how you are going to be I don’t think I want to answer any questions, at least not yet. You already passed the first round, so you will be back very soon. Maybe If you can best the next round.” 

And with a snap of his fingers I was awake. It was all just a dream, or moreso a nightmare. I have never had such a vivid dream before so I felt like I had to share it here. The weirdest part is that my alarm was blaring like usual but I didn’t wake up until almost 3 hours past the alarm. Probably just a weird coincidence or something right? Hopefully this will be the last time I have this dream.
