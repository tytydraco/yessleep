“Everyone can leave except for Luke.”

I froze. Professor Princeps never talks in that serious tone.

When the laboratory was empty, he ate a breath mint and cleared his throat.

“Tell me, Luke. was there anything else of importance you would like me to know? Anything at all?” he said seriously.

“There was one thing. The roots of the mango tree were siphoning water from a stream. The roots had strange purple veins, the same shade as the liquid sap inside the mango.”

Princeps paused for a moment. His demeanor suddenly changed, as if he had thought of something he forgot to do. “Damn it, Harding.” he muttered to himself.

“This might seem like an odd question… but are you familiar with tectonic plates?” he asked me.

“Yes, I know they cause earthquakes.”

He chuckled. “Indeed, they do. However, what is under those plates? What is buried deep in the mantle of our planet? For all we know, you could dig up the wrong rock and contract anthrax. It’s just too complicated.”

“What are you getting at?” I asked, genuinely curious.

“It’s just a hunch, but maybe these fruits are a product of this river. Maybe the water is an invasive pathogen or virus of some sort.” He explained.

Something about his confidence told me that he didn’t come up with that theory on the spot.

“If you believe that, I guess I’ll tell you one more thing.” I said finally.

“Go ahead.” He smiled.

“The animal that I met at the tree was the dromaeosaurid known as Deinonychus antirrhopus.”

The professor laughed. It wasn’t a mocking laugh. It was a laugh of excitement and eagerness. His face softened.

“I want to see this tree.” He said to me.

“I refuse to tell you the location.” I said, regretting the words as they left my mouth.

“Why not?” he said, disappointed.

I told him that it wasn’t safe, especially because of how unpredictable wild animals are. Especially when under the influence of whatever is in the stream.

“I have weapons that can turn a goddamn *T. rex* into a pile of flesh. I’m not scared of a bird.”

As much as I hated to admit it, I wanted nothing more than to go back to the site of the stream. I sighed and accepted, telling him I would be his guide.

The professor smiled. “I’m glad you came to your senses. Think of what we could accomplish out there. We could name a species after us! Imagine it… Deinonychus Jacoblukensis!”

“No. Absolutely not.” I said with certainty.

He frowned like a child denied a toy.

“Can I go too?” a voice suddenly asked. We both turned to look at the speaker. It was a woman from my class. “Uhh… who’re you?” I asked, dumbfounded.

“Where did you come from?” Professor Princeps said.

“My name is Elizabeth.” She smiled, ignoring the second question. She had blonde, curly hair and freckles. She was about my height, which is a little over 5’10.

“Why do you want to go?” I asked.

“I’m bored.”

“You’re bored? You’re in a damn jungle, how the hell can you be bored?” I raised my voice, offended at her downright blasphemous remark.

“Calm down, Luke.” Princeps silenced me and turned to the girl. “Elizabeth, I’m afraid I have to deny you this trip, it isn’t safe.”

“Please let me go, I’ll do anything!” she begged.

I couldn’t help but notice that she somehow hid without anyone seeing her colorful sweater the entire time. I wanted to ask her if she was hot wearing that, but it wouldn’t be very relevant.

The sun began to set as we debated. “Look, it’s getting late, let’s just stop chatting, shall we?” Princeps said.

“If you don’t let me go with you, I’ll tell everyone you all are leaving.” She said, getting cockier.

I groaned in annoyance. “Just let her go.” I said to Princeps. “If she gets hurt, it was her call.”

He agreed. We made our way to the building across the main garden area to meet up with the rest of the group when we heard a loud crashing sound, followed by a screech of pain. “The bird room!” Princeps said, rushing to the door. He pushed open the glass door to see the door to the bird room shattered once more. A few of the captive ostriches fled into the jungle. One ostrich lay motionless in the doorway. In the darkness of the building, I noticed the unmistakable silhouette of the Deinonychus.

“What is it?” Elizabeth said excitedly.

“Luke was right.” Princeps whispered. “It’s a fucking dinosaur.”

The dromaeosaurid tilted its head up and barked.

“Is that a velociraptor?” Elizabeth asked.

“Somehow worse than that.” I replied.

“That’s the second time ostriches have escaped into the wild.” the professor grumbled.

I slowly turned to face him, stunned. “Second?” I whispered loudly. “Also, why worry about that when we’re dealing with...”

The Deinonychus turned to look at us. It fled quickly, like a fox fleeing a henhouse. The feathered tail disappeared into the brush.

“Tomorrow, we look for the stream. Get some rest.” Princeps said finally.

I walked to the dorms. Elizabeth followed close behind, grinning with her hands behind her back.

“Are you excited?” she said enthusiastically, walking with a childlike strut.

“Honestly, yeah, I am.” I told her.

She reminded me of a child. She perceived the world as a grand adventure. A part of me wanted to be annoyed at her energetic demeanor, but a part of me enjoyed having a naïve companion. She was charming to be around, as cruel as that makes me seem.

We entered the dorms and got ready to sleep. After I brushed my teeth and changed into a large T-shirt and old shorts, I crawled into my bed and pulled the covers over my body.

“Where have you been?” Matthew said suddenly, looking down at me from the top bunk.

“None of your business.” I said firmly.

“We’re actually going to look for-” Elizabeth began but stopped when I shushed her silently.

“That sounds fun. Can I join?” he asked.

“You don’t even know what we’re doing.” I told him.

“Yeah, I do, you’re going to look for the fruit.” he said confidently.

Damn it. I didn’t even bother arguing with him. He’ll forget we even had this conversation by morning.

“Can you all do me a favor and shut the hell up?” Isaac’s disembodied voice said from across the room. I looked around for which bed he was in.

“Sorry.” I said quietly. I turned on my phone and opened Instagram. With no connection, I simply stared at a loading screen. A loon called from somewhere in the jungle. Loons didn’t live in costal environments, right? I guess I really needed to sleep, so that’s exactly what I did.

 

 

The next morning was when everything went downhill. What happened on that day could not be described with logic alone. It would be like explaining how an ant grew wings and quadrupled in size, but even that wouldn’t compare. That's just stupid.

We told the rest of the campers and staff we were leaving under the pretense of catching the escaped ostriches. The professor didn’t tell them he was bringing a shotgun. We left at 7:28 in the morning. The weather was humid and densely foggy. I tied my shoes and left with the others.

We left the premises of the camp. I tried my best to retrace my steps. We descended down a nature trail, passing ant hills and monkey troops. I made sure not to trip on any roots, but Elizabeth casually walked without a care. Professor Princeps, shotgun in hand, followed closely. In any other circumstance, a shotgun would be overkill. However, a shotgun wasn’t enough.

 We turned around a bend and were met with an absolutely putrid sight. It took several minutes to even comprehend what the hell it was. It was the corpse of a howler monkey crushed against a tree. The tree was torn to shreds. It looked like the corpse had melted into the tree’s wounds. Flies surrounded the carcass, but it didn’t look like a predator had eaten from the corpse. The most bizarre thing about this encounter was the lack of blood. Sure, the corpse was covered in it, but there was no blood pooling down below. Something must’ve killed it, then chucked the corpse away.

“Damn.” The professor said in an impressed tone. I held my breath as we walked past the corpse. Despite all we’d seen so far, nothing could prepare us for what came next. We entered a clearing next to the stream. Then we saw the tree. The mango tree towered along the canopy. The mangoes were still the same size, but in such a large quantity that the floor around the tree was one giant puddle of skin and purple fluid. There were exposed body parts of animals submerged in the ooze. A baby monkey was halfway submerged, surrounded by sticks and mud. I shuddered at the thought of a parent trying its best to free their child from the substance.

In the misty area, it was hard to determine the size of the tree. The fruits seemed to glow like lanterns. Suddenly, the purple substance began to retreat into a hole by the tree. Corpses sank into the ooze and into a pit. I felt a tugging at my ankle. Before I could comprehend what was going on, Professor Princeps grabbed my arms and pulled me back out of the ooze.

“The tree… is eating?” Princeps asked himself. “This isn’t possible.”

“We should stop trying to reason with ourselves, all logic has long since gone out the window.” Elizabeth said, her formal statement slightly startling me.

Like a drain, the purple substance retreated into the depression in the ground. We expected to just see a hole in the earth. What we really saw was a thousand times worse. It appeared to be some sort of digestive organ made of organic tissue. It inhaled and exhaled through a crude sphincter. A putrid scent of rotten carcasses emitted from the opening, causing flies to enter.

“What.” I said at a loss for words.

Crunch.

All three of us turned around. In the fog stood a birdlike creature as tall as a two story house. It remained completely motionless but appeared to be watching eagerly. The animal was completely engulfed in fog, making it impossible to determine where its eyes were. The worst part was the claws. Almost a meter long, the claws hung down from the bipedal animal’s hands, occasionally clicking together or twitching. Frozen with fear, the three of us watched as it turned its head, sizing us up.

I knew this animal.

“Therizinosaurus.” I said, my breath barely a whisper.

Carnivores usually hunt and ambush their prey. Herbivores, however, are much worse to encounter. They don’t kill for food. They simply kill to protect themselves. We were in its territory. The animal tapped its claws together quietly as it watched us. I couldn’t even see its chest rising or falling. It simply stayed motionless. The wind waved its feathers. A mango slammed into the ground beside it. The Therizinosaurus continued to stare.

It felt like a lifetime had passed during our standoff. Could Princeps shoot it? Even if he managed to land a hit on it, the animal would likely retaliate violently, even if it was on the brink of death.

Princeps turned to me. “What do we do?” he whispered.

“Claws. Weak. Make them break.” I forced myself to say through labored breathing. Our communication conjured the Therizinosaurus’s interest. It took a step forward, emitting a guttural chattering. The tail feathers swayed hypnotically as it approached like a leopard gecko approaching a cricket. It raked its claws in the dead plants. I tapped my partners’ shoulders and gestured towards a rock to my left. We made a break for the boulder.

The Therizinosaurus became enraged and began its pursuit. The massive claws swept past us. I grabbed my comrades and dove into the grass. The keratinous claws made contact with the rock. I opened my eyes, expecting to see shattered keratin. The Therizinosaurus’ claws were for display only, so using them as weapons would be impractical. Or so I thought. I turned behind me to see that the rock was the one damaged. Elizabeth and the professor caught on to my terrified expression and darted away quickly. I ran behind a tree.

It never growled or snarled. The only thing I heard was its deep breaths as it pursued.

The Therizinosaurus cleaved the tree in half. The claws dismantled the falling tree, causing the bark to rain down on me. it swung once more, its malevolent claws raking into my left shoulder. I sucked air through my teeth in pain. The claws reached down the back of my shirt, holding me in place. I pulled my arms into my shirt and slid out of it.

The dinosaur examined the tie-dye shirt with curiosity. It guided the shirt into its beaked mouth and chewed slowly before letting it fall out. I collapsed into the dirt, the many roots and rocks scraping my skin. The massive dinosaur plunged its claws into the soil, pinning me between two of them. I grabbed onto the claws and smashed a rock into the soft flesh above the claw.

Enraged, the Therizinosaurus cried out in pain and dropped its other claw down, trying to pierce my neck. I pulled myself up and used my momentum to slide past the attack. “Shoot it!” I screamed. Directing my weight to my back leg, I pushed my body to the side to evade the next swipe. The Therizinosaurus snapped at me, its beak snapping shut inches away from my ear. Blood ran down my body as I sprinted away into the deep jungle. It did not pursue.

I heard the sound of gunshots as I tumbled down a hill and fell into a muddy river. This river was much larger than the stream we found previously, but it still possessed the eerie glow of the stream. My eyes widened with the newfound realization. My blood drained into the water. I felt my left arm go limp. I noticed a swarm of aquatic insects swimming around me. They had the appearance of dragonfly larvae, but much larger. Probably about the size of a bar of soap. I tried my best to drag myself out onto the riverbank. I grabbed hold of a massive skeleton and pulled myself out of the water.

I turned back and stared directly into the cold eyes of a massive crocodile. The Deinosuchus stared at me as I stumbled away from the water. It sank into the depths, its massive tail stirring the water as it descended. I felt hazy and realized I must’ve hit my head when I fell. I felt like my neck was about to break from the weight of my cranium.

I instinctively ducked as I heard the loud buzzing of a massive dragonfly swooping over my head. It sounded like a small helicopter. The insect hovered inches away from my face. I didn’t want to swat it because the thought of me touching an insect that large made me gag. The Meganeura zipped away and chased after a lizard perched on a branch. The anole jumped too late, as the large sharp legs snatched it midair.

Shit. I made a huge mistake coming here. I stumbled through the forest, the trees waving like grass in the wind as I navigated through the mirage. I felt humbled by nature, my apathetic and intelligent visage crumbling to reveal a pathetic and weak shadow of my former glory. I had wasted my life, never slowing down to realize how irritating I must’ve appeared to others.

After an hour, I realized I was lost. I rested my hand on my shoulder wound and felt the new sensation of a smooth cluster of slimy round objects, which I soon deduced to be maggots burrowed in my flesh. I scratched the wound, causing the dozens of tiny insects to dig deeper in my flesh. I held in my scream and kept moving. Fatigued, I dragged my feet through the jungle. I processed the thought of laying down and sleeping. I wanted nothing more than to stop moving and let the jungle digest me. I was going to die.

They say that nobody dies without regrets. I would probably agree with the majority. I never did anything outright terrible in my life. At its worst, it was just unfulfilling. I never accomplished anything great or saved a life. I just passed my classes and did the bare minimum. Was I really happy with that? Absolutely not. It was my fate to meet these anomalies. Whether I died to them or made them a turning point in my life was my choice alone. That’s why I’ll keep trudging through the jungle.

My legs felt like the stumps of dead trees. I felt like I was going to buckle under my own weight. I didn’t bother asking how I hadn’t lost consciousness from blood loss. Each step felt like a minute passing. Suddenly, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned around and saw two camp employees. Their eyes widened in shock.

“Holy shit, kid, are you alright?” one of them asked.

The other gave the first employee a look that said, “are you seriously asking that?”

I looked down at my hands. My fingernails were caked with blood and my arms covered in dust. I looked like I just crawled out of hell. They told me that I fell to the ground face first.

I woke up in the medical facility. A large bandage was wrapped around my left shoulder and upper body. I gazed at the heartrate monitor as it beeped quietly. Despite feeling exhausted, I felt no need to sleep. I wanted to talk to someone immediately. Outside my room, someone looked through the window. It was the professor. A wave of emotions flooded over me. I was relieved of his survival, angered at his abandonment, and concerned at why he was watching me. I stared him in the eye.

He knocked on the heavy wooden door. I motioned him to enter. He limped into the room, diverting his weight to a cane.

“Long time no see.” I said to him.

“Take off your bandage.” He said bluntly.

“What- my- my bandage?” I stuttered. “Won’t I need that?”

“Just take it off.” he ordered sternly.

I had no intention of arguing with him. I unwrapped the bloody bandage. He held a mirror behind my back. “I was right.”

I looked into the handheld mirror. My blood ran cold. There was no scar. There was no bruise. My wound had completely healed.

“How long was I out?!” I panicked.

“A day.” he said.

I had… my body had regenerated in a day.

“Don’t bother asking how.” Princeps said as the question began to escape my mouth.

“Does the camp know?” I asked frantically, referring to the animal we encountered. “Where is Elizabeth?”

“They don’t know, and Elizabeth is playing checkers with the other campers.” He answered.

“That isn’t a good idea. That… thing…” I said with disgust, “Shouldn’t be kept hidden. People could get hurt!” I proclaimed.

“They’ll get hurt whether we tell them or not.” he said.

I looked at him. “You realize what you’re saying, right?”

Princeps nodded. “If word gets out, this island could be at risk. Imagine all the scientific advancements we could make here!” he said.

“Imagine all of the scientists who’ll die here.” I said coldly. I suddenly realized something. “Elizabeth is going to tell everyone what happened. She can’t keep her mouth shut.”

Princeps nodded. “I am aware. Everyone on the campus is going to know. Just not anyone off this island.”

I couldn’t tell what he was thinking. Was it selfishness? Was it pride? Why would Princeps keep those things a secret? Does he want all these discoveries for himself? I learned a long time ago that trying to reason with anything on this island was a waste of time.

“We will be evacuating the island when enough planes get here. I suggest you keep everyone informed about what we’re dealing with here.” he said.

I nodded and left the room. As I left the medical facility and went outside into the sunny main thoroughfare, people stared at me like they were seeing a ghost. Elizabeth got up from her checkers game and ran up to me. “How’d ya sleep?” she said. She looked down at my body. “Uh… where’s your shirt?” she asked.

“Good question.” I said without elaboration. “Woah.” She continued. “What’s your workout routine? Here I was mistaking you for a geek. What’s your max bench?”

“You ask too many questions.” I said, hiding my smile. As much as I hate to admit it, I did enjoy the attention, as I don’t get much of it at home.

“How did you get away from that dinosaur unscathed?” she asked me.

“I was going to ask you the same thing.” I said.

Suddenly, Matthew approached me. “Is it true you fought a T. rex? Who won?” he asked.

“You’ve gotta be kidding me. That wasn’t a T. rex, and I wouldn’t call it a fight.” I shrugged him off.

“What was it then?” he pressured me.

“You could say it was a giant turkey.” I said jokingly. I entered the dorms. I pulled out a clean shirt from my suitcase and pulled it over my body. I examine my arms as they slide out of the short sleeves. Not a single scratch. It must be from soaking in that river. Even then, wouldn’t I get an infection from the water? I want to know why this is happening. If this strange liquid causes animals to reverse-engineer their offspring, would my child be more primitive? I grew more uneasy as I paced around the room. Nothing about this is right.

I struggled to cling to any form of reason. Despite everything, I still wanted to go back out there to the mango tree. I want to see the organic hole next to it as it absorbs the mummified animals. I want to see more dinosaurs. The mere thought concerned me. My basic survival instincts were being thrown aside because of my passion for science. Maybe me and the professor were two sides of the same coin. I don’t want to keep guessing. I want to know.

I was ignorant back then. Looking at it now, I was reckless and stupid. I didn’t fear the consequences. Maybe I was cocky and expected to regenerate my wounds again. I don’t understand myself.

The camp was on lockdown for the remainder of the trip. Nobody left the premises. Nobody was allowed out. However, nobody accounted for the fact that people were still allowed in. Most of the college students from various schools had gathered in the cafeteria. Most of them were on their phones or talking with friends.

“You made a quick recovery.” Zeke said, taking a seat across the table. “I must say… I am thoroughly impressed.”

“You’re giving me too much credit.” I smiled. “I only did the running part.”

Zeke tapped his chin. “Hmm…” he said. “Tell me… what did you encounter that could manage to almost slice off your arm?”

I rested my cheek on my arm. “You’re not gonna believe me, but-”

He raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure it wasn’t one of the ostriches that escaped?” he asked.

“Well yes, but actually no.” I elaborated, “Do you remember the vulture hatching on the first day of camp?” I asked.

“Yes, I do remember that. The hatchling was an interesting anomaly.” he said.

“To be frank, I think it was a Deinonychus that hatched from that egg.” I told him.

He stifled a laugh. “You’re serious? You know that doesn’t just happen, right?” he said, doubting me. something told me that he wasn’t completely convinced that I was wrong.

I explained my theory. “Tectonic plates shift in the earth, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. What if the shifting of a plate caused a virus to go into a cave stream? What if this virus caused reverse evolution, turning birds back into dinosaurs? What if there was DNA mixed with the virus that turned them into a specific animal?”

Zeke was at a loss for words. “You’re an interesting man, Lucas.”

“You think I’m crazy, don’t you?” I asked, embarrassed.

“No, not at all. You might be on to something, to say the least.” He said, taking a bite out of a saltine cracker he snatched from the salad bar. “If you are completely correct on your hypothesis, I’d take you for a genius.” he said, wiping the dust off his fingers.

Matthew sat down beside me. “Hey, Zeke, are you an emotional advisor for Luke too?” he asked. I turned to Zeke, who gave me an awkward look. “Not exactly.” he said.

Matthew scratched his head. “That’s odd. Anyway, what are you talking about?”

Zeke cleared his throat. “We’re betting on a score for tonight’s volleyball game. I think the girls are going to beat the boys 40-35.”

Can you even get that score in volleyball? I had no clue and didn’t bother asking. Something told me Zeke knew about as much as I did.

“I think I should join the team.” Matthew said. “When I get in a flow state, a feel half as heavy as normal. I glide on the dance floor.”

I wanted to smash the palm of my hand against my temple until I stopped hearing.

“Half as heavy, huh?” Zeke said. “That sounds intriguing.”

He continued flaunting his volleyball skills. The only thing impressive about his skills was that I didn’t know he played volleyball.

“You took me for an Esports kind of guy.” I said. Suddenly, all three of us turned to see a figure past the glass window.

 The glass doors of the entrance shattered. The entire room went completely silent as everyone directed their gaze at the shattered door. A Deinonychus stood tall at the entrance. It was not alone.
