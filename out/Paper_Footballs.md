I’ve been reading my grandmother's old journals today. I’m at her house looking through her things while I wait for my dad to pick me up for her funeral. I don’t plan on taking anything. I guess I just realized that I wasn’t as close to her as I should have been. I always told her I would come and visit soon, but life always gets in the way. Now it’s too late, and I feel so guilty.

She doesn’t have a lot as she lived a very simple life. Her small house will be sold to pay for her debts and funeral expenses. Her belongings will likely go to those who find sentimental value in them. I’m not even really sure what I’m doing here other than beating myself up for not spending more time with her when I had the chance.

I did find something pretty interesting though. I have a tendency to hide things that are important to me around the house and I’ve noticed that my dad does as well. I guessed that if my grandmother had anything interesting, I would have to find her hiding spot.

It took a little while, but sure enough she had a hiding spot. The underside of her dresser had a lip that goes out horizontally. The small ledge is only about 6 inches long, but it was long enough for the box I found.

It’s an old shoebox. I was confused when I opened it. The first thing that caught my eye was dozens of paper footballs scattered throughout the box. Aside from those, there were several newspaper clippings and my grandmothers journal.

The newspaper clippings immediately creeped me out. Every one of them was about a missing person or a murder victim. Perhaps it was just morbid interest, similar to society's obsession with true crime stories today.

I figured that the only way to find out was to read her journal. I have some time to kill before my dad picks me up. It feels a bit like an invasion of privacy, but I just want to get to know her better. At this point, this is the only way I can.

GRANDMA’S JOURNAL-

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3/10/76

I’ve started journaling at the request of my therapist. I see her primarily because of my concerns about one of my children. He’s 11 years old, yet he still doesn’t speak.

My other child has been a blessing. He’s a year younger. Due to his father dying, he’s been through trauma. They both have. They just seem to have processed it in different ways.

Charlie is outspoken. He’s mature beyond his years. He’s more mature than some adults I know and he has helped me tremendously since the death of my husband. He’s helped me the most with his brother who has become very difficult.

Ben is my other son. He hasn’t adapted as well as Charlie has. I understand that they both experienced something awful, but the boys seemed to react to it in opposite ways.

Charlie has really helped me throughout the process. The funeral, school, cooking, everything. Ben has become a ghost.. I hate to say that about my own child. He’s a good boy at heart. He just couldn’t handle losing his father and I’m fortunate to have Charlie here to help him.

I’ve been a little distracted by the newspapers. It seems like at least once a week, they find another body. The police believe that the same person or people are responsible for all of these disappearances and murders..

These murders included my husband, Jack. They found him with limbs removed and the police say that the corpse had been messed with on multiple occasions before they found it. Not sexually, they described it as experimental. He had been essentially dissected.. Learning what had happened was more than any family should be forced to endure..

I never imagined losing my husband, my children losing their father. He could be stern with the boys. He had his anger issues, but he was a good husband and provider.

Regardless of what happened, we have been trying to move past it. The boys are going to school again. Charlie speaks like he’s an adult at this point. I feel so badly for him that he has to grow up so fast, but I am fortunate to have him here to help with Ben.

Ben still doesn’t speak. Not one word. Charlie and I both speak with him regularly, trying to find something that will coax a reaction from him. So far nothing has worked. It’s like he has no interest in engaging with the world around him.

Different doctors have disagreed about what is causing this in Ben. A few have said it is trauma related. A few have said he is mentally ill. Other doctors have said he shows no signs of mental illness aside from being mute. All I can do is continue taking him to any doctor I can get him into.

I recently started seeing a therapist, something I probably should have done long ago. She believes that journaling my thoughts and my day-to-day life can be therapeutic. So here goes..

&#x200B;

3/14/76

It’s been a quiet day today. I’m currently waiting for the boys to get home from school. I managed to avoid looking at the newspaper as I have been obsessive about it lately. The police believe that the person who killed my husband is still killing..

I don’t want to obsess about this or think about it more than I should be, but I feel like I should journal it. My husband was brutally taken from me by a psychopath, and that psychopath has not been brought to justice. Aside from my desire to see this person pay for their crimes, I’m also terrified that they will come for me or my boys. I’m constantly anxious when they are at school.

Since my husband passed, at least seven other bodies have been recovered in or around the county. The police strongly believe that they are related.. it’s like something out of the movies. Something you never expect to happen to your family..

I had to stop reading for a bit. The boys got home just a little bit ago and are eating now. Reading about what happened to my husband doesn’t feel so therapeutic now. It just hurts. I guess that’s part of the healing process.

After dinner, the boys watched some TV. I looked on as Charlie got a board game out and tried to get Ben to play with him. Ben moved his pieces to where Charlie told him to, but as usual wasn’t very engaged. This is a pretty average night for us. I spend my time either taking care of the boys or thinking about Jack.

As bedtime approached, Charlie took his brother to help him brush his teeth and get ready for bed. I came up later to tuck them in. I went to bed, woke up the next morning, and repeated the routine.

This has  been the routine for a while. The only thing I’m concerned with anymore is the safety of my boys. I don’t go anywhere. I don’t talk to anyone other than my therapist and my kids. It’s not an exciting life, but as long as they’re okay then I’ll be okay.

&#x200B;

3/22/76

It has now been about a week since I’ve written in this journal. I pretty much already wrote down what I do in a day and the days rarely change, but today something wonderful happened!

The boys were in their room. I was watching some television and getting ready to go to bed. I heard a bit of a ruckus coming from their bedroom and was about to go in there and yell at Charlie. I didn’t even notice it at first..

I walked in to find Charlie and Ben folding up pieces of paper and talking. Both of them! It came out of nowhere! Ben is talking!

So far it has been very short sentences, but he seems well spoken, considering. He doesn’t seem to have a speech impediment or anything like that. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. What I was hearing!

I found myself ironically speechless for a few moments as Charlie looked at me and winked.

“How did this happen!?” I excitedly asked Charlie.

“Ben really likes paper footballs,” he replied with a big smile.

Apparently, Charlie had shown Ben how to make these triangular little things out of a piece of paper. They had crayons and markers out and were decorating them. Since this happened, Ben is always playing with them and flicking them around.

This moment filled me with more joy than I’ve collectively experienced since the loss of my husband. I only wish he was here to see it. Ben has been gradually talking more. He is still soft-spoken but that doesn’t bother me at all. For the first time, I feel like I’m able to really communicate with him. It’s like I’m just meeting my own son for the very first time!

&#x200B;

4/13/76

Weeks have gone by and I’m just starting to get used to Ben speaking. I don’t even know what to do with myself when I’m not worrying about him. I’ve started exercising. I’ve been tending to my garden that I’ve been neglecting for years. This is the best I have felt since Jack passed!

The boys are at school. Ben’s teachers are as amazed as I was. It’s been an adjustment for him and he’s still very quiet, but he finally seems normal. He’s still very reliant on his brother, but he doesn’t seem helpless. The doctors have told me that he clearly doesn’t have a mental illness. It’s been a huge relief.

&#x200B;

4/27/76

Something happened.. I had to run some errands and I let Charlie stay home and keep an eye on Ben. Charlie’s been very well behaved and I trust him. I walked in the door and experienced something normal moms probably often experience. A mess in the living room from the boys playing.

These little paper footballs were absolutely everywhere. I wanted to be angry, but I just couldn’t. When I see these things, I think of Ben’s progress. I think about the days I wondered if I would ever hear his voice.

I started picking them up. I could hear the boys playing in their bedroom. I looked at all the little designs they had drawn on all the different little footballs. That’s when I noticed that some of them had drawings going inside, like they had drawn it and then folded them.

I unfolded one of them. I felt very uncomfortable when I saw the full drawing..

It looked like a bloody man.. It was pretty scribbled, but it looked very much like a man with his eyes closed and his chest open.. There are little drawings of things next to the torso area which had been scribbled in red. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say it looked like what the police described happened to Jack..

I told myself I was crazy and that my mind went there because it’s something that’s always in the back of my mind. I saw what I was afraid to see..

I started opening more of the paper footballs. The next one left less to the imagination. It was another man, this time with his arms and legs removed and laying next to him.. The whole picture was scribbled in red..

I panicked as I opened more.. At least half of them had strange images like these. One appeared to show a smaller person putting something into a drinking glass next to another picture of a person lying down, glass in hand..

I collected these paper footballs and took them to my bedroom. I was hyperventilating as I sat there trying to understand. Was one of the boys having sick thoughts? Why would something like this lead Ben to open up and speak?

The boys knocked on the door as I continued looking through the drawings. I told them to hold on and that I’d be out in a minute. I held back tears as I feared the worst..

&#x200B;

4/29/76

It’s been two days since I saw the drawings. I had to stop writing for a bit. It was all too much. I’ve been trying to stay in denial. The similarities are too close to ignore though..

I’ve been saving newspaper clippings about the bodies the police have been finding and all the people who’ve gone missing near here. They didn’t provide details about all of them, but they shared enough..

Every victim who’s cause of death was reported on seemed to be represented in the drawings..

27 year old male. Disemboweled and buried shallow.. I found a picture of a man in a hole with a hole in his abdomen covered in red.

30 year old male, poisoned at the fair. Police suspect foul play, but no leads. I found a picture of a small boy pouring something in a drink next to another picture of a man on the ground with a cup in his hand and a ferris wheel behind him..

19 year old male, dead from multiple gunshot wounds. Found in a wooded area along a walking trail just 5 miles from here. Police believe it could have been self defense because the wounds imply the shots came from below, like someone laying on the ground or crouched over.I found a picture of a small boy with what appears to be a gun standing next to a taller man. There were trees drawn around them.

The list goes on.. I found a picture to match almost every article and report that I had saved. What’s worse is that there are plenty of pictures drawn that I can’t find a newspaper article to match.

I can’t be sure, but I have to at the very least admit that this is too coincidental. It couldn’t be either of my boys though. They’re children! Maybe they saw something? Maybe someone at school said something to them about the murderer?

&#x200B;

4/30/76

I’m keeping a very close eye on the boys. I haven’t told them that I found the pictures. I’ve tried to coax them into talking about it by asking if anything is bothering them, if they’d heard anything interesting at school, and reminding them that I will always protect them no matter what. That they can tell me anything and I’ll never look at them differently.

Neither has said anything about the bodies. I even eavesdropped on them when they were in their room together, but I haven’t heard them mention dark thoughts, violent behavior, or anything like that. I did notice something odd while watching the news tonight though.

I had finished making dinner and sat down in my chair to eat while I watched the nightly news. The boys were in the kitchen making their plates. The very first segment, yet another body found in the area..

The victim was apparently bludgeoned with a blunt object. Police suspect that he was hit with a rock or a brick several times both before and after his death. They believe that this occurred only a few days ago. The man was so disfigured that they haven’t even identified him yet.

The report stated that police are unsure whether the crimes are related because of the different methods used. Apparently most believe it is the same killer, but opinions are mixed. The report also claimed that an item was found nearby which might help with the case, but they would not disclose what that item was.

I was just sucked into the segment that I didn’t notice it at first.. Ben was standing in the doorway between the kitchen and the living room. He was staring intensely at the TV and his hands were shaking..

I asked him if he was okay. He looked like he had just snapped out of a trance before he responded. He turned and looked into the kitchen at Charlie who was still making his plate. He looked back at me with a concerned look on his face. Finally he quietly said, “the news is scary”.

Charlie walked into the living room moments after and I told them I would change the channel and put something else on. Charlie said that he preferred to watch the news. It seemed odd for someone his age. I asked Ben to get me something from my bedroom so I could talk to Charlie alone for a moment.

I asked him why he would want to watch the news. I asked him why he would be interested in such a horrible story. He took a deep breath before telling me that he just wants the killer to be caught. He wants to know that the cops are on the right track because he thinks that it’s the same person who killed his father.

It made enough sense but it still made me uneasy. Charlie is a very intelligent kid and he’s hard to read at times. He’s very respectful, but he’s been able to lie like an adult before. He’s tricked me more than once in the past.

After dinner I put the boys to bed. I had a glass of wine to try to calm my mind. I couldn’t tell if I was overthinking things. I just wanted to come out and ask the boys, but how could I accuse my own children of something so awful?

I try to think back through the last few weeks. I couldn’t think of anything suspicious enough to warrant me coming out and asking. Perhaps I’m just being crazy. Maybe it’s a side effect of grief. Maybe I’m connecting dots that aren’t there.. God I hope so..

&#x200B;

5/03/76

I have been trying not to obsess over the news reports or the paper footballs. I’ve kept an eye out for suspicious behavior from the boys, but haven’t actively tried to coax them into telling me anything. Things almost felt normal for a few days, but that would quickly change while the boys were at school.

I held off for a few days, but I just couldn’t help myself anymore. I decided to go through the boys room to see if I could find anything suspicious. I searched under their beds, throughout their dressers, behind the stands.

I looked inside the drawer of Ben’s bedside stand. There were some crayons, markers, and one paper football..

I unfolded it to find another gruesome drawing.. This one depicted a small boy hitting a taller person with a stick or a bat. There was another picture underneath it showing a man hanging from a tree by the neck..

I couldn’t lie to myself anymore. I tried to, but something was clearly wrong. Something in me snapped when I looked at that drawing. I started tearing the room apart. I flipped over the mattresses. I looked inside the ceiling tiles. Then finally, it was such an obvious spot where I found it..

I opened the closet door. The boys shared the small closet. There were a few things hung up, but of course there were more clothes on the floor. I started tossing articles of clothing out of the closet. At the bottom of the pile on the floor, I saw the rope..

I moved more clothes and clutter out of the way before finding the bat. It was a hard wooden bat. There was a red stain near the end of it. I told myself it could be marker, or paint from wacking the shed or something. I knew that wasn’t true though..

I pulled the rope the rest of the way out. It had been tied into a noose.. It’s when I noticed the noose that I completely broke down. I screamed and cried. I wanted it to be a bad dream. It couldn’t be real. All this pent up emotion came flooding out as I reached the point where I couldn’t ignore the reality of the situation any longer.

I attempted to regain my composure before I started to clean up the room. I wasn’t going to tell the boys what I had found. I had to know if it was both of them or just one of them and if so, which one.

I put the room back to the way it was before I started searching. I took the rope and the bat and hid them in my bedroom. I would watch closely after the boys got home from school. I would wait for them to notice that the rope and bat were gone. Then I would see how they reacted.

I felt so uncomfortable when the boys got home. Then I felt guilty for feeling that way. They both seemed to be in high spirits and said they had good days at school. They had a snack when they got home, then they went into the bedroom to play.

I anxiously waited to see if either would notice the missing rope and bat. Would they get angry? Would they admit to me what was going on? Could it still be possible that it was all a crazy misunderstanding?

Things were quiet for a while. I left them alone as I cleaned up the kitchen. I could hear them talking from time to time, but nothing that seemed to be related to the rope and bat. After a while, I finally decided to check on them.

I was convinced that they hadn’t noticed the missing objects and hoped it was a terrible coincidence. Then I walked into their room. Ben was sitting on his bed with a nervous look on his face. Charlie was in the closet throwing clothes over his shoulders in a frantic fashion.

I asked if everything was okay. Charlie looked me dead in the eye and told me he was looking for a special paper football he and Ben had made together. It was chilling to see how confident he was when lying to me. If I didn’t know the truth, I would’ve believed him.

&#x200B;

5/06/76

It was hard to keep my composure for the past few days. I had no idea how he would possibly react if I told Charlie that I knew he had this secret. It felt like he knew though. He’s been acting strange and he’s smart enough to know that those objects didn’t simply disappear. I feel awful for saying it, but I’m kind of afraid of my own child..

I didn’t sleep at all last night. I spent the night obsessing over what I should do. I considered what might happen if I confronted Charlie. There were no good answers.

Early this morning before the sun came up, I heard one of the boys go into the bathroom. I got out of bed and went into the hallway to wait for them to come out. Ben came walking out of the bathroom and jumped when he saw me.

I apologized for startling him but told him I needed him to do some thing for me. I told him that he needed to pretend he was sick when they got up for school. I told him that he couldn’t tell his brother he was faking or that I told him too. I said that he needed to stay home with me. He seemed confused, but he agreed.

A few hours later it was time for the boys to get up for school. I had breakfast ready for them and was anxiously hoping that Ben would do as I asked. Charlie came down to eat and told me that Ben said he would be down in a few minutes.

I went to their bedroom to check on Ben. I told him to just stay in bed until Charlie goes to school, and tell him you are sick if he asks.

I went back to the kitchen where Charlie was finishing up eating. He was about ready to head out to wait for the bus when he asked where Ben was. I told him that Ben was sick and that he would be staying home today.

Charlie was immediately upset. His reaction was unnerving. He continuously questioned whether Ben was faking it. He voiced concerns over been falling behind after already missing some of the school year. We argued back-and-forth until I finally raised my voice and reminded him that I am the adult.

After I yelled, Charlie relented. I very rarely raised my voice. I told him I wasn’t mad at him, but that he has to remember that I am the adult. He apologized and went out to wait for the bus.

I went inside, cleaned up the kitchen, took a deep breath, and stared off into space for a few minutes. I was preparing myself to ask Ben point-blank what was going on. Lying doesn’t come as easy to him as it does with Charlie. Perhaps these footballs were his way of telling me, but I needed to hear the words..

I let him sleep in a bit before I got ready to ask him. I was sitting in the living room when he came out of his bedroom. I asked him to sit down so we could talk.

I danced around the subject at first, asking him about school, about his teachers, then about the paper footballs. I hated that I had to ask him about the drawings. I worried that nothing would ever be the same after I did. Finally, I just forced myself.

I pulled out the unfolded paper football with the drawing of the man being struck by a bat and then hanged. Ben’s eyes widened when I showed him. I asked him as calmly as I possibly could, “who is this in the picture?”

He shrugged and nervously looked away. He more closely resembled the version of him that didn’t speak. I asked him if he drew the picture and he nodded. I continuously asked who it was, but he continuously shrugged.

I told him how much I loved him and his brother. I told him that I would do anything for either of them. I also told him that I would never let anything bad happen to either of them, even if they did something terrible. I then took a deep breath and asked him, “Is this Charlie?”

He immediately looked toward the floor. He was picking at his fingernails with his other hand. I told him that I really needed to know. I told him that it would be the only way I could protect Charlie. I asked him again. He wouldn’t answer.

I was essentially badgering him after that, asking over and over and over. I could tell he was uncomfortable, but I had to know. I had to hear the words. I continuously asked, “is this Charlie?!” He was practically shaking at this point when I asked yet again and he finally responded by screaming out “Yes!”

After he yelled, he said it again with a whisper. “Yes..”

It hurt to hear even though I felt like I already knew. I told Ben that it was okay. I told him that he did the right thing. He was sobbing at this point. He softly asked me, “are you gonna tell Charlie I tattled?”

“No,” I replied. I told him that I just needed to understand what’s been happening. I asked him if there was anything else I should know.

“The treehouse”, he quietly replied.

I wasn’t aware of any treehouse. The boys played in the woods behind the house from time to time, especially in the summer. I assumed that if they built a treehouse, they would have told me about it. I asked Ben if he could show me and he begrudgingly said yes.

We went outside and I nervously followed Ben down a trail in the woods behind the house. I never thought the boys went very far into the woods when they did. I always thought they were pretty much right out back. As we hiked further and further into the woods, I realized that I was wrong. I felt guilty for not paying enough attention.

After a few minutes, we made it to a clearing where a small ground level structure stood. It was pretty rickety. There were two walls made of sticks, branches, and plywood. The roof and other sides were all made of tarps.

I followed Ben inside. It was a small space with a few turned over logs as seats. There were some stickers on the inside walls and candy wrappers waiting around on the ground.

I was looking around the place when Ben pointed to a large piece of plywood leaning against one of the walls. I pulled back the plywood to see a garbage bag on the ground behind it. I was nervous to look inside.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag were wallets. There must have been a dozen wallets, most of them with drivers licenses. In that moment, it felt way too real. I knew that if I looked at the list of missing people or bodies found, that they would match the IDs. I’ve tried to block the memory of seeing my husband’s wallet in that bag..

I continued looking through the bag to find rings, watches, and other miscellaneous objects people would have in their pockets. Ben looked like he was ashamed of himself when I looked back at him standing there watching me.

I asked Ben to tell me whether he was involved. I told him he wouldn’t be in trouble, but that I needed to know. He told me that he hadn’t seen Charlie do it, but that he told him about it. He said that he had seen the aftermath of a few of them and that Charlie described them to him in vivid detail.

As I tried to collect my thoughts, Ben gestured toward the back area of the fort. I followed him as he lifted the tarp and walked underneath it to an area behind the tree fort.

He led me to an area about 20 feet away. He walked to an area off the side of the clearing that was thick with pricker bushes and small trees. I followed him through a small bit of thick brush to a smaller opening. I saw it as soon as I reached the opening.

It was a corpse.. I knew what it was gonna be. I can smell it from the other clearing. It had started to decay. It couldn’t have been there long though, because it hasn’t decayed enough for me to not recognize the individual. I had seen the missing persons report on the news and I knew exactly who this was..

I immediately got sick and fell to my knees. I puked in the bushes several times. Ben attempted to comfort me as I cried. I then did my best to regain my composure and told Ben that it was time to leave.

We walked out from the brush, to the clearing, and then headed back through underneath the tarp on the backside of the fort. I held the flap up as Ben followed me through. I turned toward the opening of the fort and my heart skipped a beat when I saw Charlie standing there by the entrance..

I should have watched to make sure he got on the school bus.. It took me a moment before I noticed that he was holding a handgun. I asked him where he got a gun. He gestured toward the garbage bag full of wallets and watches and said “one of those guys..”

He started breathing heavily almost to the point of hyperventilation. He paced back-and-forth quickly at the opening of the fort. Every few seconds he would look over to Ben and yell, “You really had to tell her!?”

“Why did you do this?” I asked.

“To make the voices stop!” He shouted.

My heart sank when I heard him say that. Maybe I hadn’t paid enough attention to him. I spent so much time worrying about Ben but I never asked him how he was feeling. I was always just asking him for help with Ben. Maybe it was my fault..

I could see tears beginning to run down his face. The look on his face was anger, but in his eyes I saw sadness. I slowly started walking toward him with my hands held in front of me and my palms open.

I just repeated “it’s okay” over and over. I gestured toward the gun in his hand and asked him “can you please give me that?”

He was crying harder now. He looked at the gun, then toward me and Ben. He asked me, “Are you gonna send me away?”

“Of course not!” I replied. “You boys are my whole world! I’ll do anything to protect you.. I would never send you away, and I’ll never let anyone take you away! Either of you!”

I held out my arms. Ben came running in and wrapped his arms around me. I looked over to Charlie. He had tears streaming down his face. He looked toward the ground before dropping the gun. Then he ran over and hugged me as well.

I held both of my boys so tight that Ben said I was hurting him. I laughed through the tears when he said that. As I held them in my arms, I knew that I couldn’t let either of them go. It’s my job to protect them. It’s us against the world..

&#x200B;

5/08/76

Things have calmed down since the unpleasantness. The boys are acting normal after an awkward couple of days. Charlie has been wonderful toward me now that he knows that I’ll protect him. In a strange way, me and my boys are closer than ever.

They wanted to continue going to school even though I offered to pull them out. I’m trying to put what happened behind us. The boys seem okay though, considering.

I walked into their room today to find them laughing and playing a game with their paper footballs. I smiled as I thought back to the days of Ben not speaking, the aftermath of my husband’s death, the first drawing I noticed.

We’ve been through so much as a family. We always got through it together. We will always get through it together. I left their bedroom and noticed one of their paper footballs on the floor of the hallway. I picked it up and saw a drawing leading into the fold. I thought about opening it and looking, but I instead smiled and put it in my drawer next to my photographs and my diary.

We went out as a family to burn the wallets and other evidence. In a morbid way, it was a nice family moment. We have a family secret now, and I intend to take it to my grave..

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

I’ve been in shock since I finished reading the diary.. I can’t believe what I read. Grandma was a sweet old lady.. I don’t even think I’ve ever heard her swear. I just can’t believe it..

I know that my uncle is in a mental institution now. I never knew the reason and I never really knew him. My dad always said that putting him in there was the hardest thing he ever had to do. He said that even with the Alzheimer’s, grandma was upset about it. She may have quickly forgotten though as she had a lot of difficulty with her memory in the later years of her life.

My hands were shaking as I unfolded one of the paper footballs in the box. There was a drawing inside that looked like a child drew it. It depicted a small boy pointing a gun at a woman and another small child behind her. There are blue dots around the boy’s eyes that I assume are supposed to be tears.

I was stunned as I stared at the drawing. I about jumped out of my skin when I heard a knock at the door. I quickly started putting everything back in the box. I could hear my dad impatiently asking for me to open the door.

As I went to put the box back under the dresser, I stopped for a moment. I considered that someone else will end up going through this stuff. I put the diary in my bag. I refolded the paper football I had opened up and put it in my pocket. I left the photographs in the box and put it back under the dresser.

I ran to the door and opened it. Dad said something snarky like “Sorry to interrupt your busy schedule.” Then he snickered and said, “Come on, we gotta hurry”.

I grabbed my bag and shut the door to grandma‘s house. I clutched the paper football in my pocket as I tried to process what I had just read. I found myself zoning out for a minute.

“You okay?” My dad asked.

“Yeah,” I replied. “Just.. funerals.”

“I know bud,” he said softly. “I miss her too.”

I took a moment to consider the memories that must be flooding back for him. I turned and took one last look at grandma‘s house. I started walking as I heard my stepmom yelling to my dad from the car, “Chuck! We’re gonna be late!”

I got into the car. We pulled out of the driveway and I watched grandma‘s house fade into the distance behind us. I thought about how I wouldn’t be here if grandma hadn’t kept her secret.

From the backseat, I could see my dad looking at me through the rearview mirror and smiling. I smiled back. I ran my fingers along the edges of the paper football in my pocket. Then I was headed off for grandma‘s funeral, having gained a better understanding of where these dark thoughts have been coming from..
