I’ve never believed in God. Or the devil. Or any of the shit people cling to so they don’t have to face the fact that life is just a long stretch of wasted days. Blabbering about the “lottery” and special numbers on a clock is all excuses people live by to fill their lives with empty hope. I see it the way it is.

I run a motel. Two stars, maybe one if you catch it on a bad week. The kind of place you stop at when you’re desperate, not because you planned on it. But because the missus dumped you and a twelve-pack of Bud Light short-off broke. I spend most nights slumped in the office chair with the TV droning on about football and rumors of war, half-waiting for someone to ring the bell. Half waiting for gunfire. Nobody ever does.

That night, though, somebody did.

He wasn’t like the usual strays we get. No smell of booze, no hollow eyes. Just… plain. That’s the only word for him. Like his face was designed to disappear in a crowd. Someone you see passing by late at night in your car. He asked for a room in the calmest voice I’ve ever heard, like he’d been practicing the words for weeks, but never learned eye contact.

I slid the key across the counter, told him the power cuts out sometimes if he plugs in too much, and went back to my chair.

Five minutes later, he came back.  
“Do you have a big Sharpie?” he asked. Digging through the pen cup on the counter like he expected it to be there.

Not a pen. Not a marker. Specifically a big Sharpie. I told him no. He nodded like that answer meant something important, and went back to his room.

Ten minutes later, he came again.  
“Can my room get more power?”  
I laughed at him, told him it was a two-star dump, not a five-star hotel. He didn’t laugh back. Just nodded again, like he was checking off a list.

By the third time, when he asked, “Is there another person living next to me?” I started to feel the itch under my skin. Because nobody was booked in that wing. Nobody. Most of the rooms around him were visibly shut down. A man’s gotta keep the lights on.

I didn’t follow him right away. I told myself it wasn’t worth the effort, that people do weird shit all the time, and none of it mattered. Not in a place like this. But when the hours dragged and his door stayed cracked open with the key left dangling from the lock, I finally got up. He never paid. My worst pet peeve.

The room looked normal at first. Sheets pulled back, suitcase on the floor, one lamp buzzing overhead. But then I saw it — a fracture running along the wall behind the bed. Thin as a hairline crack, blacker than shadow, cutting straight through the wallpaper.

I should’ve seen plaster, or insulation. Instead, the wall looked untouched. Like the crack was there and not there all at once. Didn’t seem like the type to pull magic tricks outta his ass but… here we are.

I leaned closer. And in the dark slit, something twitched. A red eye, sliding along the seam like it was tracking me.

Before I could laugh at his sad attempt to pull a prank, I felt an overwhelming gravity that locked me in place.

My body didn’t wait for my brain. Every bone felt like it snapped at once, ribs grinding, spine twisting. I didn’t fall — I was pulled. The crack widened just enough to drag me through, skin and tendon tearing against gravity I couldn’t fight.

The last thing I saw before it swallowed me was the open motel door swinging in the wind, like I’d never been there at all.

Whatever just ate me whole… yeah, hurt like hell. Funny, right? Not that I’d tell anyone that.

Maybe that room isn’t safe. Maybe this guy isn’t just some regular weirdo. Maybe I shouldn’t even be here.

But I’ll figure it out. Or I won’t. Doesn’t really matter. Just… don’t go in that room if you value your skin.
