So like many people. I am a pretty big fan of Spider-Man. I read the comics, watch the cartoons and movies, collect the little action figures and play the games. I have been a fan of the web-slinger ever since I was just one year old

One day, I was at my local game store, looking for rare games to buy, and then I stumbled across a GBA game titled Spider-Man 4, supposedly for the unreleased Raimi movie.

The cartridge was clear red (I think it was the same one used for Pokémon Ruby) the label had a fake logo and a Spider-Man image from Spider-Man 3.

I knew something was off (there were only 3 Raimi movies), So me being intrigued, I bought the game for about 30 bucks, and when I got home, I popped the game into my GBA SP.

The game booted up, and there were no logos except for the Spider-Man 4 logo. I pressed “New Game”, and it took me to the gameplay

The gameplay was a standard platformer, but it had really impressive graphics for the GBA. The controls were responsive as well. 

The game started with Spider-Man rescuing people from a burning building, and the rest of the game was mostly normal Spider-Man stuff, like swinging around in the city, fighting crime, rescuing people, etc.

However when I got to the first boss (I think it was Kraven the Hunter), I noticed that it started getting really glitchy. I eventually beat him, and went to the next level.

The next few levels went fine, but then when I got to the boss part (I think it might have been The Thing from Fantastic Four), that’s when it started to get really buggy.

I beat the boss, however the glitches were still bad, if not worse than before. These glitches became so bad that they actually caused the GBA to start glitching up other games as well.

I tried Mario Kart, however it would only let me play as Toad, Pokémon Emerald only caused everyone to have Linoone, Zelda wouldn’t let you have items, etc

I then decided to throw Spider-Man 4 out thinking it had to do with it, and the GBA glitches went away. I thought this was odd, shrugged and went to sleep (i stayed up late that night playing the fame)

The next morning, I went downstairs to wake up my dog and make some breakfast, and I saw Spider-Man 4 just sitting on my kitchen table. I thought that was weird since I threw it out, so I asked my parents and brothers if they fished it out of the trash, they all responded with no.

I checked the security cameras if anyone put it there, and nothing showed up, heck I couldn’t see the game on them.

I decided to give the game one more chance.

I booted it up, and it took me to the place where I quit. There weren’t any glitches, until I got to the boss fight, which was the Incredible Hulk.

After I beat the Hulk, the screen went black, and that is when everything went horribly wrong.

Not only did the screen turn black, it started glitching even worse even though the screen was black, it caused the other GBA games to glitch up again. apparently it had a sensor that caused a ton of other electronics to glitch up, like my TV, all computers in my house, everyones phones, etc. Even some strange things like electronic dolls and walkie talkies started glitching

Even some of my neighbors electronics glitched up.

To top it off it even caused our downstairs smoke alarm to start glitching, and the smoke alarm caught on fire, however we put it out before the fire got really bad.

I then decided to just throw the game into the ravine near my house, and after that everything went back to normal, and I never saw that game ever again

However I do hear stories of people who wander into the ravine, only to never be seen again

I think the game may have something to do with it.
