I stared at the dark open [doorway](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/142tkdw/im_the_new_sheriff_in_hollows_end_monsters_are/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) in terror and disbelief.  Jay had just disappeared into the house after it looked like someone very powerful had picked him up by the top of his head to drag him in there.  I had caught a glimpse of a large, furry blue hand, reminding me of Sulley from Monsters inc.

"Help!" I heard Jay scream a second later, before his cries were cut short by a hand or a fuzzy gag over his mouth.  

"We gotta save him," I said to Randy, looking at my drunken deputy with deep concern.  "You go in first."

He shook his head, no. 

"Nuh uh.  I'm not going in there.  That big, blue bastard will kill us all.  I say we leave.  Jay can handle himself, he's a professional."

I let out an annoyed grunt and pushed my way through the door and into the house.  It looked like I'd have to deal with this myself.  What else is new?

"Jay?" I called out, entering the dark home.  

Immediately I was assaulted by a horrific odor. It smelled like dead bodies and spoiled meat, mixed with blood and shit and all the worst smells I could think of.  It was like a rainbow of decay - one of every terrible variety.  

“HELP!” I heard Jay cry out again and I followed the sound of his voice, going deeper into the darkness.  

Eventually I came to a room with a giant rectangular mirror facing upwards in the center, sitting atop a dining room table.  It reminded me a bit of a sacrificial altar.  Jay was laying on top of it, tied up with thick rope.  The gag which had been stuffed into his mouth had slipped out and he was screaming at me, “LOOKOUT!” 

I ducked as a giant, furry fist came flying at the side of my head.  It connected with the wall beside where I had been standing a moment earlier and the plaster caved inwards.  The entire room shook with the impact and dust and debris snowed down from overhead.  

“Die, you interdimensional bastard,” a deep voice boomed as he swung his fist at me again.  I ducked and rolled out of the way, surprised at my own reflexes.  

“Wait,” I yelled.  “We’re from THIS dimension!  We’re trying to save it!  That’s why we came for the monkey paw!”

Frank's eyes turned to narrow slits as he scrutinized me.

“Yeah, do you have it?” Jay asked from where he was laying on top of the mirror.  

The enormous blue creature stood panting in front of us, looking angry but uncertain.  His teeth were bared showing long canines everywhere as he seemed to contemplate whether we were lying or not.  

“How do I know you’re not from another dimension?” he asked, showing me the long talons on the ends of his fingers.  There was dried blood hardened at the tips.  

“You can ask us anything,” I said.  “Something that someone from another dimension would never know.”

Frank stood there thinking about it for a few seconds.  

“Okay.  Best Nicholas Cage movie.  Go!”

“Seriously?  That’s more of an opinion-based answer, isn’t it?” 

He began to growl, low and deep under his breath.  

“Okay!  Wow, short fuse.  Gone in Sixty Seconds.  No, Ghost Rider!  Wait, Con Air.  And, I guess National Treasure was also pretty good.”

He seemed to relax after that.  

"Good work, you passed."

“But I said four different answers!  How is that a test for interdimensional beings?  Don’t they have Nicholas Cage in other dimensions?”

“Yes, but he accepts so many roles that the possibilities are endless.  Very few dimensions have overlapping Nicholas Cage filmographies,” Frank grumbled back.  “And I don’t have the monkey paw.  The last person I saw with it was Randy.”

“Son of a bitch,” I said, running back to the front door.  I circled the house, looking everywhere for him.  But of course, Randy was long gone.  

“Of course he had it the whole time,” I said as I re-entered the room.  “Why does that not surprise me in the slightest?”

Frank was untying Jay and helping him down from the sacrificial altar made of an old mirror and a table.  

“What the hell were you gonna do with all this, anyway?” I asked Frank, trying not to stare.  Before today I would have run out of the room screaming just looking at him, but after all I’d been through, a talking ten foot tall blue bear made of shag carpeting was the least of my concerns.  

“I… I don’t want to talk about it.”

“C’mon, Frank.  We’re trying to save Hollow’s End.  We need your help.  What the hell were you planning to do?”

"Just tell us, Frank," Jay pleaded.  "Muriel needs our help, man."

He let out a deep, rumbling sigh.

“That's what I was doing.  I was trying to figure out a way to get over there,” he said eventually.  “Muriel asked for my help the other day and I said no.  Then she didn’t come back and…”

“You were trying to save her!” Jay yelled, smiling triumphantly.  “So you do have a heart in there somewhere you big, furry lump!”

Frank moved so quickly that he was a blur, picking Jay up by the throat and holding him against the wall.  His face began to turn pink, then red, then purple as he ran out of oxygen.  

“I do NOT have a heart.  I have SIX hearts!  And you will not speak of this to anyone or I’ll take out yours and make it an even seven.”

He dropped Jay to the ground where he lay in a heap, trying to catch his breath.  I heard him squeak something that sounded like an apology.

“Alright, thanks for clearing that up, Frank.  Now, can you help us?  Since we kinda have the same overall goal in mind?  We all want to save Muriel and the butcher, and that other guy that I kinda forgot about until just now.  Sorry, there’s a lot of people missing and I’m kinda drunk.”

“Why are you drunk?” Frank asked.  “Aren’t you a police officer?  I thought you were on duty?”

“Yes, yes, and yes.  And I’m drunk for the same reason you’re gonna want to be drunk pretty soon.  This interdimensional virus is contagious, and you’re both gonna start seeing some weird shit unless you get a little fucked up with me.  Which reminds me, you should probably break that mirror.  Seven years of bad luck is a helluva lot better than the current alternative.”

Eventually the three of us left Frank’s house.  He managed to disguise himself using a large trench coat and a hat, but it was still pretty obvious he was a ten-foot tall furry blue monster.  Regardless, he got to sit shotgun and I was forced to squeeze into the backseat behind his girth, since there was a large tank of nitrous oxide taking up most of the leg room behind Jay’s seat.  

“Okay, where would he be this time of day?” I asked, thinking out loud.  

The two of them thought about it and began to name a few potential spots.  The monkey bars at the jungle gym, the ditch in front of the liquor store, the petting zoo, and Randy’s other frequent haunts.  We spent nearly an hour visiting all of them, and then ran out of ideas.  

“I guess there is one more place,” I said.  “But there’s no way he’d be stupid enough to go there.”

“Lead the way,” Jay said optimistically.  “That sounds exactly right.”

When I opened the door to the Sheriff’s station, I was not entirely surprised to see Randy sitting in the jail cell with the cage door closed.  He was drinking out of my coffee mug again, looking very pleased with himself.  

“You had it this whole time!?” I nearly screamed at him as I entered, pulling out the keys for the jail cell.  “How could you lie to me like that?  I thought you were trying to help me!”

“Hey now, I never lied to you.  That’s a complete mischaracterization.  I simply asked Jay if HE had the monkey paw, IMPLYING that I didn’t have it.  Implying and lying are two totally different things.”

“I hate you so much right now.”

Jay marched over and pointed at him, looking ready to say some really crippling, mean things, but then slowly lowered his finger and just nodded his head.  

“Yeah, we all hate you.  Frank too, right Frank?”

“Yes.  I hate being forced to leave my dark secluded home to socialize with others.  Now, hand over the monkey paw, Jay.”

“No can do, furrball.  I got plans for this paw,” Randy said, removing the cursed object from his coat pocket.  Two of the five fingers had been lowered, meaning he had already made two wishes and had three left.  

“It’s evil, Randy!  That fucking thing is cursed!  You’ve seen the damage it can do.  How can you keep acting like this?”

I was still searching for the jail cell key and realized it was gone.  

“He stole the key,” I muttered to Jay.  “I can’t get in there.”

Frank overheard this and marched toward the cage.  He reached over and pulled the door with one hand, tearing it from its hinges and snapping the lock.  Shards of metal went flying and landed on the ground. 

“Wish it all back to normal again.  Tell that paw you want to make everything the way it was,” Frank said, advancing on Randy.  “Do it, or I’ll tear your head off your shoulders and use it as a tetherball.”

“That sounds… messy…”  

Randy held out the monkey paw, as if to hand it over.  Then, at the last second, he made another wish.

Of course, since it was Randy, it was a really stupid wish.  

The polar bear he summoned was larger than Frank, but not by much.  The two of them began to fight almost immediately, as if the bear knew that he was the biggest threat in the room and, like a man on his first day in prison, wanted to show its dominance. 

As the two of them wrestled I tried to come up with something to make him get rid of it.  To wish it away back to where it came from. 

“Man, send that poor thing back to the arctic!  That’s just mean.  They’re already endangered.  Haven’t you seen those videos of them floating on the chunks of ice?”

I hoped this tactic would work and was once again surprised when it did.  Moments after the epic battle began, it ended just as abruptly, as Randy sent the creature back to the arctic just as it was about to tear out one of Frank’s six hearts.  

*Note to self: Randy likes animals.  Use this to manipulate him.*

I looked to see that Randy only had one wish left.  He’d wasted two of them on summoning the polar bear and then sending it back where it came from.  

“We need you to think about this rationally, Randy.  You need to use that last wish to save the town.  Just tell the monkey paw to change everything back to normal, and to bring back the Butcher and Muriel-”

“That’s three wishes,” he interjected.  “It doesn’t work that way.  Trust me, I tried.  A hot fudge sundae without peanuts is really not as good, by the way.  Cursed monkey paw, it always knows how to screw you.”

“You wasted a wish on… Oh, fuck it, nevermind.  I guess we’re gonna have to save Muriel and the Butcher ourselves,” I said.  

“Don’t forget that other guy,” Jay interjected.  

“Oh, yeah.  And that other guy.  John, I think his name was.  Anyway, let’s go to the other dimension, save them, then when we get back here you can wish for everything to go back to normal.  Okay, Randy?”

He nodded reluctantly.  

“Yeah, I guess that’s fair.  But I get to hang onto the monkey paw until then.  If shit goes down, I want to have an exit strategy.”

“Fair enough,” I said.  “Okay, let’s find a mirror and go into this other dimension.  Hopefully it’s not too late.”

We went downtown and found a home decor shop which sold several varieties of mirrors, big and small.  I went inside and bought the largest, cheapest one I could find, saving the receipt for tax purposes.  This had to qualify for a work expense, but I hoped I wouldn’t have to explain that to an auditor.  

“Alright, how does this work exactly?” I asked Randy, resting the mirror against the side of the building so that we could step through it like a doorway.  

“All I do is think about where I want to go, and then when I step into the mirror I come out where I want to be on the other side.  I’m assuming you guys can just follow me, but it probably wouldn’t hurt to think ‘Mirror World’ in your mind when you walk through.  Y’know, in case if you don’t you’ll wind up in a timeless void with no hope of escape.  I haven’t put much thought into it, though.”

Frank, Jay, and I looked at each other nervously.  

“Okay, here goes nothing,” Randy said, stepping through the mirror.  It rippled and moved like water, and then he was gone.  

“You go next,” Jay said to me, nudging me forward.  “I’ll be right behind you.”

I took a deep, trembling breath.  Terrified, I stepped into the [glass.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/zpi8zt/master_story_list_updated_regularly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
