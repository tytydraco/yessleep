Time remaining: 1 minute 25 seconds...


I tapped my fingers on the coffee table while watching the blue circle on the screen go round and round. 3, 2, 1...


Download complete.


I've bee wanting to use this app for a little while. I came across it while doomscrolling on the app store - which could be considered a new personal low. It's kind of like those prediction apps, you enter your name and it's supposed to tell you when you are going to die.


I clicked "Open."


The screen turned black, and later a text appeared in red letters and very sharp fornt, kinda reminded me of horror movies (or maybe some death metal bands). Final Countdown. That was the app name.


"Seems innocent enough. Just a random choice calculator", I thought to myself.


I hit start. The next page loaded a white box with writing above it: "Please enter your FULL name (e.g. Samantha Brownshoe)."


I typed my name in the box. My fingers trembled with adrenaline as I prepared to hit the button.


And then the notification came:


TIME REMAINING: LESS THAN 24 HOURS


I paused for a second. I was expecting some shit like 75 years or so, but oh well. Let's give it another go. So I did. I went back to the main menu. Start. Entered my name. Waited.


Same response.


LESS THAN 24 HOURS


Huh. I guess it's one of those generators that only spits one answer to each user. Unlucky I guess.


I left the house to go run some errands. The traffic was unbearable, so I decided to take a shortcut into an alley, thinking I'd be done much faster. 


I was driving in peace for a while, when the sound of a horn penetrated my skull. I swear I have never slammed on the breaks so fast before. 


"Dude, are you fucking serious?"


On my right, I saw a man exit his vehicle and march towards me, murmuring and spitting curses all along. I couldn't understand what he was talking about, I started looking around the street trying to figure out what was happening.


I had missed a stop sign.


And I still cannot, for the life of me, remember how that happened. The only thing I clearly remember, is the man's last words, that made my blood run cold. 


"The way you drive, you're gonna be dead in less than twenty four hous, asshole! And I sure as hell don't want to go to jail for someone like you!"


Less. Than. Twenty-four. Hours.


With trembling hands, I pulled over and immediately opened my phone. The coutdown was still the same, but there was a new footnote at the bottom:


Dodged death: 1/2


I felt my heart beating in my throat. I didn't know what to think. My better judgment told me this is stupid, that it's just an app. But my gut was screaming that something was wrong.


What does 1/2 mean? What's going to happen after 2 times?...


I parked the car and decided to walk the rest of the way, so I could take my mind off of things. The more time passed, the more this app started to get in my head. I kept checking over and over. 19 hours, 18, 17... 


By the time I returned, I felt I was completely loosing my mind. The whole ride home, I kept walking past signs of the kind "live every day like it's your last". Even the cashier at the grocery store seemed off. She never once took her eyes off me while scanning the products, and had this god awful grin on her face, spreading from ear to ear. 


I threw my sack of bones of a body on the couch and turned on the TV, in a final attempt to unwind and clear my head. 


But, of course, that wasn't even close to what happened. 


"Ladies and gentlemen, we are interrupting our usual programming to announce an emergency broadcast. A robbery has taken place at a local grocery store, and has left behind a number of victims."


My eyes opened so wide they nearly fell out of my sockets.


That was the store I was just in.


"The culprit has not yet been arrested, and security footage from the store does not provide with a clear image for identification."


The sound of a notification made me jump. 


App: You have 1 new notification.


I was begging and praying it wouldn't be what I thought. 


Dodged death: 2/2


My knees gave in. I sat in silence for moments thay felt like an eternity, unable to think or act in any way. I wanted to run, but there was nowhere to go. How do you escape death?


Now I sit here writing this, after someone knocked on my door just a second ago. Three slow, steady knocks, and a sense of impending doom lingering in the air. There's someone out there, waiting for me. Maybe if I stay inside, I can escape. Maybe if I don't answer the door, he will get tired and leave, and the countdown will stop.

Maybe I can escape.


But maybe I can't. 


I'm feeling sicker as the time goes by. 


And i think I coughed up a bit of blood.
