4:30 PM

When I took the dispatcher position back in my hometown, I didn’t think I would have to deal with the kinds of things I’ve had to deal with today. It is now 4:30 PM Christmas Day as I write this. I’m hoping that I can get this posted before the end of the day so I can warn as many people as possible. You don’t want to be caught unaware of what’s going on right now. 

I am assuming that this is going on everywhere, but I don’t know that for sure right now. Although I am certain that you will agree with my assumption once you have read to the end of this post. Also, please forgive me if I ramble. I am very frantically typing this at the moment, and I may occasionally tangent to relieve stress. I don’t really have time to edit this, and it is a necessary coping mechanism, so deal with it. Please.

For context, I live in a small midwestern town; corn, soy, and grain country. I had just finished college and was experiencing some heavy burnout. I took the job back home, I think, because I needed some newfound sense of direction. Up until that point, I had been following a path laid out for me, not that I hadn’t made my own decisions, but I was making those choices with the eye of others in mind. I didn’t care about that anymore. Local dispatch for my hometown was the first opportunity where I thought I would be helpful, as in helping people, not somebody’s profit margin.

The only problem is I hate cops. I don’t know for certain what the origin of calling them pigs is, but I like to think it has to do with them basically being the state’s clean-up crew. In the sense that pigs served as the mob’s clean-up crew. I ended up taking the job because I knew a few of the cops from when I was a kid, and the sergeant in charge helped me out one time. I thought I could do some good with these personal connections. But now, I don’t know what any single person can do about anything anymore.

My family wasn’t around, so I decided to work Christmas Day at the station. Earlier in the month, it had snowed a ton, but now there was nothing but a thick layer of mist that made everything it touched wet. I hate 100% humidity. It makes my whole body sticky and uncomfortable. Regardless, I was inside quickly enough that it didn’t bother me too much. The sergeant, I’ll call him Bill, and his deputy, Greg, were the only two cops on call that day.

“Well, hey there, Nate, I hope you slept well?” Bill spoke with a deep baritone from under a bristly white mustache. 

“Yeah,” I said, evading the question. I began setting up my desk the way I liked it. I had my police mojo computer on my right and my own personal laptop on my left, which I was planning to watch Queen’s Gambit on.

“Good to hear it. Well, I’ll let you get to it. Me and Greg are gonna go get some coffee. So give us a call if anything explodes.” 

I smiled at him. “Will do.” He gave me a nod and walked away. I felt the rumble of their cruiser as it started. 

During this time, I was the only dispatcher on duty for my area, which was large, but didn’t even have one person per square mile on average. So, I was the lonely watchmen. A skeleton crew was normal, as this day was usually pretty uneventful out here, but I was worried about the fog and car accidents. I decided to raid the break room for snacks. On my way back, I passed by the front door for what would’ve been the second time. I was some distance from it down the hall, but as it perceived me, I felt a shiver run through my whole body. A huge deer, shrouded in fog from the bottom of the neck down, was staring through the clear glass of the front door. Staring at me as I held my bags of chips, cookies, and shit. It didn’t move, but its empty black eyes followed me as I receded towards my little office. I threw everything on my desk, then peeked back down the hall. It was gone.

“What the fuck,” I spat it out as if just then realising what happened. It didn’t look alive, closer to a taxidermied trophy.  

Any thinking I could’ve done was interrupted by a 911 call. I quickly sat at my desk, took a deep breath, and picked it up. “911, what’s your emergency?”

“It’s Earl!” I recognized the voice on the other end.

“Margaret? It’s Nate. Is Earl having another heart attack?” As I spoke, I entered her address and held the mouse over the button that would dispatch an ambulance. 

“Oh, Nate! Yes, he’s… he’s.  OH MY GOD!” I dispatched the ambulance, emphasizing emergency.

“Margaret? Are you okay?”

“He’s dead, he’s dead.”

“It’s okay, Mrs. Adler. The ambulance is already on its way, they’re gonna help him.”

“No, I…I felt his pulse go.” She started crying. 

I radioed Bill, muting the call. “Bill, I just sent an ambulance to the Adler residence. It’s not looking good, so you might want to head over.”

“Roger that.”

I heard Margaret wheezing and moving quickly, then the slam of a door, followed by more crying. “I can’t believe he’s dead. Oh my god, he’s dead.”

“Margaret, Bill’s gonna be there soon, okay?”

“Okay,” she said. Then an almost thunderous knocking.

“Margaret? Is everything okay?” 

I looked over at the GPS map. Bill was eight minutes away. The ambulance was four minutes away. Margaret gave nothing in reply other than a short intake of breath. I heard a doorknob twist and creak. Then a frantic movement and a click. She locked it.

“Margaret, was anyone else in the house with you?”

“No,” she whispered. “I had my finger on his pulse the whole time. That is not my husband.”

“Margaret? Why’d you lock me out?” It sounded like him. I have since googled Lazarus Sydrome but at the time, I assumed this was impossible, which it might as well have been. Regardless, the real thing that scared me was that Margaret didn’t trust it. In this situation, she should be in denial of his death, not of his life. 

“Don’t open the door,” I said. “The ambulance is three minutes away.”

“Margaret! Please! I’ve been to the other side, I can tell you! I can tell! I can tell! I can tell you! Margaret!” I heard a loud bang against the door. “That’s okay. You’ll find out soon enough anyways.” I heard muffled receding footsteps. Time passed in silence. I heard a more distant knock after the paramedics arrived. Then she hung up. I sat there for a moment. I don’t know how long. Another call came in. I answered.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Um… my-my name is Eddy.” The voice sounded like a young boy’s

“Okay, Eddy, what’s going on?”

“Um…a car hit us. Really hard.”

“Do you know where you are?”

“No, it hit on my mom’s side. She’s not moving.” I heard him start to cry.

“Is the driver of the other car still there?”

“He flew.”

“What do you mean?”

“He wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He hit our car too.” 

I almost said “fuck me” out loud. This was not at all the stress level I was anticipating for the day.

“Who’s on the phone!?” I heard a man’s voice yell.

“Is that him?” He sounded fine. Then I remembered the last call.

“Yeah.”

"Did you call the fucking cops, little shit?"

"Eddy! I'm stuck." A woman's voice. Eddy, are you okay!? I can't see you!"

“Eddy, run down the street until you find a street sign okay?” I heard no response. “Eddy?” somebody hung up. “FUCK!!” I yelled. I was beginning to panic. I felt my chest tighten, and I began to cry as I spiraled down thoughts of uselessness. “What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?” I repeated to myself over and over again. Then I wrote this. I’ll let you know if anything else happens out here.



Thank you for reading 

Even though there’s nothing you can do

  


7 PM

Bill and Greg returned to the station sometime after that and found me in my office with my head in my arms.

“You okay there, Nate?” I looked up into his eyes. He looked tired. 

“Yeah, what happened to Margaret?” He sighed and thought for a moment. Instead of responding, he waved his arm and walked away. I rolled myself and my chair into the hall. “What do we do now?” I asked. The phone rang, and I went back into the office. Bill started walking back towards me. I picked up.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“I’m at Skeeter’s Pub, and there’s a guy with a gun.”

“Okay, is he threatening people with it?”

“Not yet, but him and this guy keep getting at it with each other. They got here before me, so I think they’re both drunk.”

“Alright, a coupleof  officers are on the way.” 

I muted myself as she said, “Thank you.”

“Armed drunkard at Skeeter’s pub,” I looked at Bill. I’d never seen him scared like that before.

“Goddamnit, Greg, let’s go. Stay on the phone and keep us updated, Nate!” They left. 

“Ma’am, can you get yourself out of the pub?”

“Not without moving past them, I’d rather just stay here.”

“Fuck you!” I heard from a distance. Then a loud pop followed by lots of screaming.

“Oh my god, he shot him,” she was whispering now. “No, wait, did he miss?”

“No way,” I heard another voice. “I saw it go straight through his head.”

“What the fuck? He’s getting back up.”

“The man who was shot?” I asked.

“Yeah, he got shot in the head and just got back up. The other guy doesn’t know what to do.” I heard several more gunshots. 

“AHHHH!” A scream followed by a repetitive banging.

“Holy shit, he’s just smashing his face on the bar.”

“FREEZE!” I heard Bill yell. Something wet slid and then dropped onto the floor.

“I think the other guy is dead.” A wet gurgle and a fit of coughing followed. “Uh…I uh…”

“What’s happening?”

“He… got back up. What the fuck!? He got back up like it was nothing!?”

Pandemonium and several more gunshots followed before I lost connection. 

Am I anything but an observer?

Do I have the power to change things?

My shift ends soon

I guess I’ll go home
