I am prone to nightmares. I have been since I was a child. But while others have different nightmares each night, I suffer from the same recurring dream that comes to me once every year.

The dream always starts out the same. I am in the courtyard of a large castle. The first time I had the dream, I remember the experience being tranquil. Of enjoying the rosebushes beneath the silver moonlight and noticing the crisp cool of the night air mix in sweetly with the scent of the flowers. I must’ve only been four years old at the time, but I enjoyed the scene as deeply as though I were a much older man. But in subsequent dreams, the sight of rosebushes would come to haunt me, for each time I saw them, and the marble steps of the walkway, I would know at once what was to follow, and would begin to search the courtyard frantically for who I next expected to see.

She doesn’t always appear in the same place each time. At times, she would be lurking behind the statues in the courtyard, and other times I could see her up on a faraway balcony. But most often she appeared walking down the corridor that ran along the parameter of the courtyard, from between the rows of arched columns. Every time I saw her there was a ping of recognition, as though she were familiar to me. She was hauntingly pale and wore a white gown that appeared almost to fluoresce. Beneath her eyes, she bore the dark rings of smeared mascara, though her face was emotionless as she walked with the calm cool of a person whose mind was well and truly made up. Spots of blood stained her white dress.

Seeing her always sparks a panic in me. I feel an overwhelming need to know where she is going. In each dream I chase after her. Sometimes, like the times when she’s on the balcony, I run throughout the castle all night and never find her. Other times, she toys with me, and goes down the wrong path, leading me to dead ends. But in the dreams where she walks down the courtyard corridor, I feel a leap of excitement, for those are the dreams that I find the most success in following her.

She always leads me through a door at the end that passes through the servants’ quarters, with its rows of closed doors. At the end is a fork. She always turns left. The first night, she was nowhere to be seen around the corner. But in subsequent dreams, when I run a little faster, I can catch a glimpse of her white gown slip through a side door and up a service stairwell.

She then travels down a hallway that overlooks the outer castle. My first time up, I lost her by being transfixed by the marble cliffs of the coastline and the inky black sea beyond. But I have since learned to ignore the landscape, and sprint down the hall as fast as I can, for at the end, I always come up to a wooden door with an iron ring handle that is bolted shut. I never make it in time before it closes. Sometimes, when I am quick, I can catch a glimpse of the door being shut. But then I hear the thud of it slamming into its frame, and the click of the bolt sliding into place. And that is how the dream always ends.

It wouldn’t be such a bad dream to have, if it weren’t for the overwhelming sense of dread that prevails throughout. I am always infected by a horrible desperation to make it to the woman in time, and a great sense of worry of what should happen if I don’t.

But what makes it most unbearable is the feeling that, after all these years of having the dream, I am no closer to finding out the mystery of the locked door. The dreams don’t always come in set intervals, and in fact, have become less frequent with time. Each time the dream doesn’t happen for a while, I wonder if I am at last over this strange, childhood fixation of mine. And then one night, when I close my eyes, I’ll see the silvery rosebushes and I am once again reminded of the task that I have not been able to complete in twenty-four years of trying.

I have never been able to put together who the woman is. She looks like no one I have ever met before. And no amount of travel has led me to a castle quite like the one with the glistening, marble courtyard.

But, in the last year, the dream did not come at all. Nor did it the year before in fact. I realized that I was now two and a half years free of seeing the ghostly woman. But knowing that brought me no sense of relief. It felt like something unfinished, and I was beginning to think that not knowing the mystery of that room was much worse than whatever horrible secret lay inside.

I am now a schoolteacher, and for years have been teaching a class in History at St. Augustine’s. One summer, while on vacation, I took a trip through the rural parts of Scotland. It was there, in the small town of Aemish, that I came across a newspaper on a nearby stand. On it was a photograph of an automobile collision with the headline “Woman Killed in Roadside Disaster”.

I read on:

*On Thursday the 22\*\***^(nd)* *at 8:32 p.m., police were called to the scene of a highway accident along the M8. A young woman, believed to be on route to her wedding, was found dead.*

I stopped here, for there was an eerie feeling of recognition that came over me. The paper went on to say that she had been speeding along a cliffside road, when she failed to make a turn. Her car smashed through the guard rails and fell a hundred meters down to the stony coastline. There was no mention of a name.

I am not a nosy man by nature, but I was filled with an overwhelming desire to know more. I scoured the paper for any mention of a wedding, and when I didn’t find one, I asked the man at the stand for a copy of last week's paper. It was there that I found mention: *Come to the wedding of Eva and Franklin Geller, this Thursday at 9 p.m.* There was an address, and when I asked the man about the location, he told me that it was the spot of a popular tourist destination, The Castle Amsgard.

I got back in my car and drove as quickly as I could. It was dusk by the time I arrived. As I neared, I recognized the white cliffs of the coastline, with a small dirt trail running parallel that led to the foot of two massive doors. The Castle Amsgard rose as high as the early stars on the evening sky, with its ivory towers and face of marble white. My heart was thumping as soon as I saw it. I had to try to control my breathing, for I knew deep in my bones that this was the castle from my dreams.

There were several cars parked outside. People were packing away tables and streamers. When I arrived on the lawn an elderly woman looked up at me and said, “The wedding’s off.”

“Oh, I’m not here for the wedding,” I told the woman, “I’m just a tourist. I visited the castle when I was child and was just hoping to get a quick look for old time's sake.”

“Well, don’t let us stop you. This is a solemn occasion for me and my family. We’re in no mood to entertain," she begrudgingly said.

I nodded. “What happened that had the wedding be called off, if you don’t mind me asking?” I eventually found the nerve to ask.

“The bride passed away,” the elderly woman said, “in a car accident.”

“I’m so sorry,” I said.

“No, you’re not,” the old woman grumbled as she pushed by me with a box of plates.

“Was she in too much of a hurry to go to her own wedding?” I asked, "was that what caused her fate?"

“You ask a lot of questions.”

“I’m only a stranger,” I said, “I promise I won’t say a word of this to anyone. I’m just often a little too curious for my own good.”

The old woman sighed. “She got news that the groom had slept with one of her bridesmaids before the wedding. She got in her car and drove off before anyone could get a word in to stop her. He’s up there now,” she said, glancing up at one of the towers, “locked himself away. Won’t talk to anyone. Refuses to take blame for any of it. The low life.”

I froze. “He’s up there? Right now?” I could see the locked door appear visibly in my mind.

“Yes, but it’s no use trying to get through to him…”

Before the old woman had finished talking, I was already sprinting for the large double doors. I had a hunch, a suspicion, that something was about to happen. Within me there burned that sense of dread that so often burdened my dreams.

I ran through the halls of the castle, shocked by how familiar the stone corridors felt to me. I remembered all those nights I’d wandered aimlessly around them. I knew the way by heart now that led into the deep interior of the castle.

I ran until I reached a stone archway, and through it, I stepped out into a courtyard. The moon was out by now. My heart nearly stopped as my eyes fell on the rosebushes. The marble walkway, the distant balconies, the statues, all of it was exactly as I had dreamed. I couldn’t believe it. I wondered if I wasn’t dreaming now, and that the trip into Aemish and the talk with the old lady were just a prelude to the old familiar dream that I worried was about to come.

I caught a flash of white out of the corner of my eye. There was the ghostly woman, strolling as effortlessly as she did along the adjacent corridor. Her clothes were even bloodier than I remembered, and what I had once mistaken as purposefulness in her eyes, I now saw as a blinding hate. Without even hesitating, I bolted after her. I ran full speed down the servants’ corridor, alarmed by how much it all looked the same. I turned left and bounded up the steps of service stairwell, tripping once or twice, as I moved with a blind determination, faster than I had ever moved in the dreams before.

At the top, I could see the doorway down the hall. The woman was walking towards it. I screamed at her to stop as I sprinted after her, but I was still too late. The door slammed shut in front of me and I heard the deadbolt slide in.

My heart roared inside my chest. I listened for any clue of what was going on inside. And as I did, I heard a man speak. “Eva?” he said in a whisper. And then silence. I listened for a moment still until a chilling scream erupted from the night. I cannot for the life of me describe to you what it was like. It was like nothing I had heard before. A scream of the deepest disbelief and terror. A scream that I myself might’ve had if I’d seen the white woman in her bloody dress for first time, looking at me with those scornful eyes.

I ran for the window and screamed down to the guests for help. Three of the men arrived two minutes later. By then, the cries of the man had finished. There came no more sounds from behind the door.

We found a nearby stone bench and the four of us used it as a ram to break down the door. Inside, we found a small study, with a writing desk, a knocked over stool, and pages lying all around. From a rope in the center of the room hung Franklin. His eyes were bloodshot, his skin a ghostly pale, and his face was contorted into an unending shriek, the image of which will be burned in the back of my mind for as long as I should live. There was no sign of the woman.

The family were in shock, and no one could guess how I had known the suicide was about to take place. I didn’t tell them about the bride. I left not knowing how to feel about the mystery that had taken up so many years of my life, and why it was I who should receive the unearthly warning. I have since come to discover that I am of a distant relation to the Gellers, and I wonder if it was not some long forgotten bond that had foretold me of Franklin’s demise, though what I was supposed to do with that prophecy I may never know.
