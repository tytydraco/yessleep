I didn’t sleep. Not after Shaan. Not after seeing his tie whip the air like it remembered the shape of his throat.

When morning came, it wasn’t light that woke me. It was laughter. Thin, echoing, from somewhere too close to the walls. Children. I checked the time. 7:45 a.m. The rule said midnight. This was not the time for children.

I opened the cupboard again. The diary smelled stronger—sweet rot and oil. The pressed marigold had darkened overnight, like something had fed on its color.

I flipped the blank pages hoping one would change. Hoping it wouldn’t.

On the very last page, new words bled through like wet ink:

DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY BELONG TO HIM.

I slammed the book shut.

I tried the lift in daylight. It worked like any other lift: creaky, patient, slow. But when I hit G, it stalled between floors. The lights flickered. A voice whispered my name as if spoken into the back of my skull.

Sameer.

The khaki-clad operator stood inside. Except there hadn’t been anyone when the doors closed. His eyes didn’t blink. His cap shadowed his face. He asked:

“Are you new?”

Every muscle in my body screamed look down. Rule 8. Stare at your shoes. Press any button. Don’t answer.

I pressed 13.

The doors opened. But it wasn’t my corridor.

The walls were dripping candle wax. The numbers above each door were carved, not painted. And the air smelled of black sesame and jaggery.

At the far end, a man in a neat shirt and tie stood with a tan briefcase. He didn’t move, but I felt the smile before I saw it.

Ajmera.

The lift shut by itself and carried me back up. When the doors opened again, it was my floor. Damp marigold garlands. Buzzing light. Normal, as if nothing had happened.

I ran to the terrace door before I could stop myself. The final rule throbbed in my head.

Never go to the terrace. The landlord lives there.

But rules can be cages, too.

The lock was already open.

I pushed.

The terrace stretched wider than the building itself. A trick of space, like the horizon had been folded wrong. Rows of marigold garlands lay rotting in heaps. Incense smoke crawled across the ground instead of rising.

And there were hooks. Dozens. Rusted, nailed into the concrete, swaying though there was no wind. From each one hung a bag of something that twitched faintly, like it remembered being alive.

In the middle stood Ajmera. His briefcase was open, and inside were sweets—black sesame laddoos piled like offerings. But they pulsed, as if something beneath the surface wanted to breathe.

He looked up. His eyes were wrong. Too smooth. Like marbles pressed where eyes should be.

“Welcome home, Sameer,” he said. His voice was the same one that had called my name inside the lift. The same one the children laughed with. The same one Shaan’s diary whispered through.

“You followed the rules.”

And he smiled.

I don’t remember running back down. I don’t remember locking the door.

But I’m in 13A again. The diary is open on the floor. Its pages keep filling themselves with words I don’t write.

Every blank page now has a single sentence, over and over:

WE ARE FAMILY.

And in my landlord’s WhatsApp profile picture, if I zoom enough, it isn’t just light in 13B anymore.

It’s a boy in a pale blue uniform shirt. Standing at the window. Smiling.

Edit : I don’t know how long I can stay. The rules are changing in front of me. They’re not fifteen anymore. There’s a new sixteenth rule written at the bottom of my landlord’s last message. I swear it wasn’t there yesterday.

16. When you finally hear me knock, open. We are waiting.
