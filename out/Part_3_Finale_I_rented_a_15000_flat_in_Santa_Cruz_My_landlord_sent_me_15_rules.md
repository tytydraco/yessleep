I didn’t sleep. Not after Shaan. Not after the fan’s thin wheeze kept tracing a boy’s last breath through my ceiling.

Morning didn’t arrive. It seeped. Pale light bled through the curtains while I counted fan clicks like rosary beads.

At 7:12 a.m. the intercom coughed once, reminding me it knew my name. It didn’t ring. It didn’t need to. The rules stirred in my head:
It learns your voice. Do not breathe at the crack. Never go to the terrace.

I made tea with bottled water. The towel over the mirror had a wet thumbprint on the inside. Not mine.

In the hall, footsteps matched me for five beats then stopped when I stopped. I slid a rolled towel hard against the door’s bottom until the draft stopped touching my ankles like a tongue.

I was brave long enough to be stupid. I went looking for the extra landing.


---

Between the seventh and eighth floors, a shadow waited: the outline of a landing that had forgotten to be built. My feet corrected it.

A black door stood there, its number carved not painted, wet as if the wound wouldn’t close. In front, an offering plate of tilgul sweets—black, damp. From what? From breath.

The door exhaled. The hair on my arms leaned toward it. Rule 7 thudded in my skull. I climbed until the real eighth floor pretended nothing had happened.

Back in 13A, the diary had edged closer to the bed like a stray that knows kitchen timings. The pressed marigold bled darker, like a thumbprint.

Blank pages weren’t blank anymore.

DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES. THEY BELONG TO HIM.
HE FEEDS ON HABITS.
HE COUNTS IN FIFTY-TWOS.
DON’T LET HIM COUNT YOU.

The handwriting was adult, gouged deep enough to scar the paper’s back.

The next page held a photocopy: Kutumbakam CHS AGM Minutes – 27/10/2017. The stamp was crooked, the paper smelled of kerosene.

> Agenda Item 3: Weekly Sankalp Pooja to continue for “kutumb cohesion.”
Resolved: unanimous.
Note: Water tank to be covered after incidents with stray animals.
Note: Children’s laughter during power fluctuations to be ignored—“electrical discharge in conduits.”



Signed: Secretary – Mrinal.

Mrinal. The WhatsApp landlord.

On the next page, in jagged ink:
MRINAL IS NOT THE LANDLORD. THE LANDLORD IS WHAT LIVES WHERE MRINAL LIVES.

Below, 36 names. Each marked JUMPED, BURNT, HUNG. Beneath: BRANCHES carved deep.

Banyan roots. Family. Kutumbakam.

At 1:53 p.m. my phone died.

Rule 11: Do not let your phone die inside the flat. When it is dead, reflections get ideas.

The black screen behaved like a second room.

A second me blinked back—delayed, like a livestream lagging. I raised my right hand. He raised his left, then corrected himself. He looked past me.

The bathroom towel slipped. The reflection of my bed had someone already in it. Breathing in a rhythm almost mine.

I spoke. “Who are you?”

The intercom rang. One bright beep. Then my own voice echoed back: Who are you? Tilted wrong, like a man practicing a new language.

The bed breathed deeper, pleased we’d been introduced.

I grabbed my backpack. Rule 9: if someone is already in your bed, leave immediately. Do not pack. Do not turn.

I turned.

The sheet showed the faint print of a striped tie across a chest. Blue bled through like gasoline sky.

“Shaan?” I asked, because my stupidity has always looked like hope.

The sheet smiled, crease stretching into a mouth too wide. I ran.


---

The stairwell smelled of incense. Rule 13 belonged to 2:00 a.m., not 2:00 p.m., but time obeys the building.

The khaki lift operator stood waiting. Eyes too wide. Counting under his breath: one… two… three…

I climbed.

Between 7 and 8, the black door whispered my name, sweet as tilgul. Behind it, voices braided—uncles, aunties, children giggling until it became choking. Kutumb, kutumb.

Three knocks rattled my window upstairs. Rule 10 allows three. A fourth bent the curtain rod like a hand leaning to peer in.

I kept climbing.


---

The terrace door was unlocked.

Rule 15: Never go to the terrace. The landlord lives there.

The terrace stretched wider than the building. Hooks lined the parapet. From each hung sacks that twitched like they remembered being alive.

A chauk was drawn in lampblack and turmeric: a banyan tree whose roots grew downward from branches. Thirty-six names on the roots, and a fresh red dab waiting for a thirty-seventh.

Ajmera waited by the tank. Shirt neat, cuffs damp with something not water. Tan briefcase open, rows of black sesame laddoos pulsing faintly.

“Welcome, Sameer,” he said with my voice. “Eat, beta. Speak sweetly. Belong.”

The diary’s warning burned in me: DON’T FOLLOW THE RULES.

I bit my tongue and spat blood into the chauk. The roots darkened like wet stone. The sacks shuddered once, then stilled.

Ajmera’s face slid like a mask catching on teeth. Smooth marble eyes behind it looked… relieved.

“Ah. A breaker,” he murmured. “We haven’t had one since Shaan tried to count backwards.”

He touched the red dab on the tree. “We are thirty-six. We need fifty-two. Fifty-two voices. Fifty-two windows. You’ll help us count.”

Below, the intercom rang through concrete. Beep. Beep. Children laughed in my corridor. Light flickered though every clock said 2:17 p.m.

“It’s not midnight,” I said.

“It is if we say.”

Something knocked my window four times. Shaan’s figure stood in 13B, tie in hand, counting on his fingers. He lifted a fifth.

“Don’t call him Shaan,” Mrinal’s voice said from the intercom inside my skull. “He’s ours. We don’t use small names. We use roles.”

“What’s mine?”

He smiled with my mouth. “Landlord.”


---

I don’t remember reaching 13A. The door was open. The towel pushed under it like a tongue retreating. Two shapes breathed under the sheet.

My dead phone lit anyway: WhatsApp—Mrinal. 1 new message.

There were sixteen rules now.

16. When you finally hear me knock, open. We are waiting.

The bed smiled. The towel lifted. The kitchen whispered my name.

The key I found inside the diary is slick with oil that isn’t oil. Teeth cut in wrong places, like it was made for a throat.

Knocks now overlap—from the black door, from the intercom, from the mirror’s mouth.

Three. Four. Five.

The sixth is for me.

I am going to open.

Edit: If this posts, it means I got something through the keyhole that is not me. If I don’t reply, do not DM, do not visit. If your phone dies while reading this, put it face down and count backwards from fifty-two without using numbers that curve. Don’t ask why. It’s not a rule. It’s a wound.
