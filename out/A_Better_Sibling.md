We had been searching for three hours when Sean finally figured it out. I’m not sure if it was our hushed tone or our hesitation at the trail intersections we came across that gave it away.

“Are we lost?” he asked. I shuddered at his worried voice. This weekend was supposed to be an opportunity for me to bond with my younger brother, and he had begun the overnight hike with such excitement and exuberance. Now, we were deep in the woods, far into our phones’ no-coverage zone, and my father and I had to break the bad news – bad news for which I was responsible.

Dad crouched down to Sean’s height. “Yes,” he said. “I didn’t want to get you worried, because I’ve been to these woods before and I thought I could find a way out of them. But, I’m afraid your sister and I don’t really know where we are.” Sean’s eyes grew wide. He was, after all, still at an age where he viewed his father as infallible and his much older sister – the ten-year age gap had made me almost a replacement for our long-absent mother. Now, I feared that my mistake had shattered this image.

“But it’s okay, son,” my dad continued, “We packed for an overnight trip, and we’ll be fine. If we still can’t find any of the main trails, I have an idea that I’m sure will bring us to safety. We’ll be back at home tomorrow night just like we planned.

“But what about the map?” asked Sean, looking up at me.

I felt the color drain from my face. “I…I…” I stuttered, ashamed.

“Your sister seems to have lost our map,” said dad. He shot me a stern glance. “But it’s okay. You don’t need to worry. We’ll figure this out together, as a family.”

I don’t know how it happened. Dad had put me in charge of the map when we had parked at the edge of the Rich Mountain hiking trail that morning. Everything had gone so smoothly at first. I led us down a half-mile dirt path that, like the rest of the Appalachian woods that stretched through Southwest Virginia, was lined on both sides with the vibrant colors of early fall leaves that decorated oak, maple, and birch trees. We arrived at the swimming hole at the base of a long cascade, a common stop for families looking for an easy outing, and proceeded to spend time playing in the water and then picnicking with food we had packed.

After we had dried off and changed back into our hiking clothes, we began the much longer trek to a prominent deep-woods campsite, where we planned to spend a night before returning home the next day. The coolness of the morning air faded into a strong midday sun. Dad and I sweated under the weight of the two tents and camping equipment we lugged on our backs, but the trail was mostly flat and we quickly got used to the burden.

Dad directed us at first. We split from the prominent trail onto a smaller, less well-maintained dirt path, and then onto another, even narrower one filled with rugged small rocks. It was barely a path at all as, from any distance, it was hard to distinguish from the surrounding woods. After a few hours of this, Dad commented that the territory we were going through looked unfamiliar to him, so we’d better take a look at the map.

We rested in a clearing. While Sean was climbing up a large stump, proclaiming it a throne upon which he sat as king of the woods, I fished through the items I was carrying to find the map. My dad stood over me, patiently. “You alright, there?” he said, noting the worried expression on my face.

“It’s not here,” I whispered, not wanting to worry my brother unnecessarily. Surely, it would turn up before long.

But it didn’t. My dad and I looked through our respective backpacks and even Sean’s small knapsack. The map was nowhere to be found.

“When was the last time you saw it?” asked my father.

I responded that it had been at the swimming hole, right as we were packing up our belongings again. We exchanged a concerned glance.

“Don’t worry,” said my father, reassuringly. “We’ll figure this out.”

That was six hours ago. We tried, of course, going back the way that we came. My father had always had a good sense of direction, so we followed his lead through several windy paths. Occasionally, I would feel like I recognized our surroundings, only to second-guess myself – was that the same set of spruce trees we had passed before, or a different one?

It got dark only a few hours after Sean caught on. “Dad,” I said. “I’m so sorry.”

He sighed. I felt the pain of all the times I had disappointed him run through me. Even worse was realizing that I was letting down my kid brother.

“It’s alright – you didn’t do it on purpose,” dad said.

I asked him about his other idea. He took out his compass and explained that we had generally been heading southeast all morning and early afternoon. All we needed to do was go the opposite direction – northwest – and before long, we’d be close to where we started. At the very least, we’d come across a few peaks from which we’d be able to see the surrounding valleys and determine our location.

We trudged along this way for another hour before evening started to fall. The only sounds were those of the woods: insects buzzing around and gentle breezes swaying branches.

Realizing we only had a little natural light left, we kept our eyes out for a place to camp for the night, eventually identifying a patch of dirt largely unobstructed by trees or roots. Dad and I set up the two tents, one for Sean and me and one for him, and lined a space with rocks where we started a small fire with wood we had gathered nearby.

Dad exchanged pleasant words with us, telling us we would be back at home this time tomorrow night, as we cooked and ate the food we had packed for dinner. Eventually, Sean and I retired to our tent. Sean was worried but also exhausted from the day of intense hiking, and before long I heard the rhythmic breathing of him in deep sleep.

I, on the other hand, tossed and turned with discontent. Today’s events triggered other painful memories. I remember sifting through mom’s wallet, back when she and my dad’s marriage had descended to the point of regular screaming matches, and using what I stole to procure the pills I craved for, pills that brought me a much-needed sense of contentment. The look of disappointment dad had given me earlier today had been the same as when he caught me taking more money, this time from my own brother’s funds for a field trip, to feed my addiction. Now, I wanted so badly to be a better sister, but here I was again letting him down.

Unable to sleep, I emerged from the tent and returned to the fire. It was dying out, with only a few embers emitting light, and in this half-darkness I could see my father sitting there, leaning against his heavy backpack and whittling a stick with his hunting knife.

“Can’t sleep?” he whispered.

I shook my head.

“I understand,” he said. “Don’t be too hard on yourself. I’m proud of you, honey.” I must have continued looking downcast, because he continued trying to cheer me up and even apologized for his many work-related weekend absences from home.

We sat together quietly, staring into the fire, for a few moments before he got to his feet. “I’m going to see if I can get some rest for tomorrow. You should do the same, when you’re ready. Just make sure to put out the fire when you go.” With that, he entered his tent and left me alone.

I sat for a minute, observing how the woods seemed ominous and foreboding at night. Glancing at the opening of dad’s backpack, I glimpsed the lid of a prescription box in a flicker of light from the dying fire.

In other circumstances, I would have left it alone as my youth rehab program had taught me. But I was so distraught at the dire situation in which I had placed my family that I guiltily reached for it, hoping to find something that could improve my mood. I didn’t imagine that the box would contain the painkillers I craved for, but maybe it would have something that could help me relax.

I held the label in front of my eyes. Allergy pills. I sighed, disappointed in the contents and in myself, and reached into dad’s backpack to return the container. My hand felt a thick, folded piece of paper. My heart sank as I realized what it was. I quickly pulled it out of the backpack.

It was the map. The same one I had used to guide us to the swimming hole this morning. The guide to the entire region of woods in which we had found ourselves lost.

My mind ran in circles. Sean and I had spent the last ten hours distressed at our situation, and dad had had the map on him all along. I felt dizzy thinking of all the implications. Had dad taken the map out of my backpack when I wasn’t paying attention, and then pretended not to find it when I realized it was missing? I recalled a point when I had been in the water with Sean while dad prepared our picnic. He would have had a perfect opportunity to remove it then. But why would he do that?

Dad had also been the one to assure us we didn’t need to check the map for the first several miles, stopping me from noting its absence until we were already deep into the forest.

What was going on? Where was dad leading us, and why was he tricking us into thinking we were lost?

I thought about using the map to run away. With the compass, which I also found in dad’s pack, I could surely return to the main trail and call for help. But could I leave Sean? Would he come with me voluntarily without waking up dad?

I grew angry, too, at all the blame dad had allowed me to assign to myself. That *bastard*. He had watched me become overcome with guilt, while all along he was the one leading Sean and I astray. Why was he doing this?

I turned on my cellphone, which, predictably, had no signal, and used its flashlight feature to find and pick up dad’s knife, and also to find our location on the map. I noticed a ranger’s station listed a bit north of us and decided to set off there and get help. Hopefully, I would find someone tonight who would return here and help figure out what was going on. And, hopefully, we would get back before dad realized I was gone.

I sat silently for a bit, trying to discern if dad was asleep. I had a nightmarish image of him rushing out of his tent to find me in possession of the map, and I could only imagine what would happen next. For now, dad didn’t realize that I was on to him, and that gave me some advantage in trying to thwart whatever he was trying to accomplish.

Moving as quietly as I could, I set out into the woods.

The initially flat route developed gradually into a steep ascent. I quickened my pace as I got further away from our makeshift campsite. Beyond every crooked set of branches I saw a visage of my dad in the shadows, a man I had thought I could trust. In the distance I heard the faint sound of running water mixed with hoots from owls and mating calls from insects. My legs began to ache as I continued up the hill, but adrenaline pushed me forward.

Finally, as the perfect darkness of midnight settled around me, I reached the peak of the mountain and saw the outline of a dilapidated shack before me.

I walked slowly up to the entrance, my mind somehow more nervous than before. I was a young woman alone in the woods, after all – what if what I found inside was worse than my crazed father?

Hesitantly, I knocked quietly at the rusted door, then louder when I heard no response. Finally, I pushed at the door. It creaked open, apparently unlocked.

At first, I saw nothing inside but darkness. The floors were wooden, the ceiling was low, and the room before me appeared barren. Using my phone’s flashlight once more, I made out a long, oval-shaped mirror at the other end. Stepping closer, I gazed into the reflection of my own distraught form. My thin frame shook with worry. My long, disheveled chestnut hair at least somewhat obscured my panicked and sweaty face.

In the reflection, I began to notice something floating over my left shoulder. I froze, too afraid to turn around and see it directly. A translucent, wispy shape appeared behind me. For a moment, I saw its murky textures swirl together to form a barren face that consisted only of eyes and a nose. Then, a mouth grew into it, and the entity let out an inhuman moan.

I panicked at this, stumbling to the corner of the room and tripping over an old piece of carpet. I felt myself fall to the ground, and then through the floor onto the dirt below.

I drew dad’s knife and held it out towards the gap above me, prepared to swipe it at anything I saw. But nothing came, so I looked around and examined my surroundings.

What I found there shocked me even more than the shape that had appeared a moment earlier.  I found myself surrounded on all sides by bones. Human bones. Hundreds of them.

I felt like I was about to pass out from the stench and from the horror coursing through my body. But even what I had seen so far did nothing to prepare me for what I was about to witness.

There was one body that consisted of more than bones. It was still lined with decomposing flesh, and it smelled the worst of all. I dropped the knife and vomited immediately after my phone’s light gave me a better look at it.

It was my dad. His head and torso lay a few feet from me, and I saw a leg about a yard away. The dirt underneath was stained a deep auburn red.

At last, I heard footsteps creeping close to the hole in the floor where I had dropped down. Frantically, I shined my phone’s light around the room, noticing a small gap in the wall. Crawling as fast as I could over the remains that littered the area underneath the floor of the shack, I slid through the hole and found myself back outside.

I took a brief moment to get my bearings, and then I sprinted down the hill as fast as I could, heading in the direction of the campsite and never looking back.

When I was close to the bottom of the hill, long out of sight of the building, I finally stopped. I hadn’t realized how out-of-breath the journey up and down that hill had made me. Panting, I sat down against the back of a tree and noticed the first glimmers of morning light appearing on the horizon.

I went through it all in my mind. The mirror. The shape that formed behind me. The area between the floor and the dirt – not really a basement and more like a crawlspace – littered with human bones and my dad’s decomposing body.

Of course, if *that* was my dad, then who was leading Sean and I into the woods?
This person, who had shown such love and affection towards us – this couldn’t be our real dad. Our real father was dead, and had been for some time, judging by the body I had seen, and this imposter had taken his place. Our real dad would never pretend to be lost like this, much less falsely place the blame on me for it. But how was any of this possible?
I didn’t have time to grieve. I knew at that moment that I had to stop the man in the campsite from achieving his goal. I didn’t know what that goal was, but I knew it involved Sean and me.

I crept slowly back to where we had set up our tents. It was still early in the morning, and hopefully both my dad and Sean had not noticed my absence. Dad’s tent was shut and looked no different from when I had left it. I returned the map and compass to dad’s backpack and threw water on the last few embers of the fire, which I had forgotten to put out in my earlier panic. I carefully unzipped the door to my tent and crawled inside of it.

Thankfully, Sean was still asleep. Quietly, I pulled a towel from my backpack and wiped off sweat from all over my body. If the thing pretending to be dad came along, I wanted it to think I had been asleep in the tent, not running through the woods all night.

I lay down on my pillow and tried to think of a plan, of some way to lead my brother and me out of this nightmare. Quickly, I decided the best thing to do was to wake up Sean, tell him some story to convince him to follow me, and take him in the woods with me, as far away from dad’s imposter as we could get. I could use the compass and map to find our way back to civilization. From there, I could convince the authorities to check out the abandoned ranger station in the woods. Upon finding the bodies, they’d know I was telling the truth. It wasn’t a great plan, but it was all I could come up with.

No sooner had I resolved on this course of action than I heard footsteps approaching the tent. I braced myself, not sure what was outside. A moment later, the thing that was pretending to be my father shouted, “Good morning, kids, rise and shine! Sorry to wake you so soon, but we need to get an early start if we’re going to find our way out of here.” Sean stirred as I realized that I had missed my chance.

Within a half hour, we had eaten a light breakfast and packed up our belongings. Sean and *it* both noticed my unease, and both assured me that I didn’t need to beat myself up for losing the map. “We’ll figure this out soon,” said dad, patting me on the back. He was being so unusually kind and sincere that I nearly bought into the act. “After a couple miles hiking in the direction of the road, I guarantee we’ll find our way back to the main trail.”

The forest looked so much more welcoming in the daylight, and my father was being supportive. He optimistically insisted that our trip would end up being the same overnight camping experience it would have been had nothing gone wrong. Sean even returned to his more typical jovial mood.

That’s when I started second-guessing myself. I thought about how I was lying in the tent, right where I had tried to go to sleep only a few hours earlier, when dad had called out for us to get up. The things I’d seen were simply impossible. Had I simply awoken from a vivid dream?

As we began hiking up a steeper incline, Sean and I both struggling to keep up with dad, a terrible image ran through my head, of me running off with Sean when, in fact, nothing was wrong, and me pointlessly putting him in more danger in the process.

“You okay, Laura?” said dad, looking back at me. “You don’t seem yourself.”

“I’m fine, dad,” I said. I looked him over carefully, trying to find some discrepancy that could validate my imposter theory. But he perfectly resembled the same dad I had known, and depended on, for 17 years. He shrugged and moved on.

We climbed higher and higher. Sean, unburdened by any heavy camping gear, was just able to keep up. But I felt so tired, tired enough to feel like I had been out moving all of last night, not sleeping soundly as I was beginning to hope.

Then we reached the summit. All around us on either side were green valleys surrounded by thick forest. Then, ahead and by a steep cliff side, was a building.

Was this man an imposter, taking us to that horrible place, so that our bodies would be added to the many underneath it? Or was this a different place entirely?

The building before us now had a second floor, which I hadn’t seen in the structure I visited last night. But it also conveyed a sense of familiarity that sent a deep chill down my spine.

“Maybe there is someone inside!” said Sean, excitedly.

I walked to the rocky cliff side. There was water running down it.

“Laura, come on!” called dad. “We need to check this place out! It looks like a ranger station. If anyone is here, they can help us!” He was by the building’s entrance, Sean at his side.

I didn’t budge.

“Wait here,” I heard my dad say, followed by the sounds of his footsteps approaching me.

The stream below formed a waterfall, a cascade. At the bottom of the steep decline, I saw the shallow swimming pool where we had started the previous day. We were less than a mile from where we had parked, and if this man was really my father, he would have noticed and said that. It was entirely possible that I had been this close to the road last night and just didn’t realize it – I had, after all, had plenty to distract me from carefully examining the map.

“Laura, you need to come over to us,” said dad. He was right behind me now. I felt his hand grab me and nudge me in the direction of the building. “We need to see if there’s anyone here who can help us. We can admire the view later.” I resisted and continued to stare at the water below. He stepped in front of me, smiling and waving his hand around. “You okay, honey? You seem like you’re in some kind of trance.”

“Do you have your knife?” I asked, remembering that I had dropped it in the building the night before. If my dad didn’t have it, then what I experienced had to be real.

“What?” said dad.

“If you have it, show it to me,” I said.

“Well,” said dad, pausing to think, “I don’t remember where it is.”

“I know where you keep it,” I said.

My dad shot me a concerned look, something that seemed of a different character. “And where is that?” he asked.

“In your backpack,” I said, “with the map *you* said *I* lost.”

Dad’s expression shifted. “Honey,” he said, calmly, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t have any map. You had the only one.”

“You said we were far away from where we started,” I said. My dad’s eyes now cast an insidious glare. “But look down there. Don’t you recognize it?”

Dad turned and looked down the precipice. “Oh, it’s nothing!” he said. “There are all sorts of waterfalls in these woods, it’s not the same one at al-“

He never finished the sentence. Seeing my chance, I slammed all my body weight into his back. Before he knew what was happening, he was flying off the edge and through the air. Adrenaline again pumped through my whole body as I realized what I had done. I watched as he skidded off the side of the cliffs before landing on a rocky alcove hundreds of feet below. It goes without saying that his body didn’t move again.

I stepped back, slowly. *What have I done? What if I was wrong?*

Every thought in my mind now turned to Sean. I looked to see him backing away from me, understandably horrified. There were tears in his eyes.

“Sean, it’s okay,” I said, approaching him. “It’s not what it looks like. It wasn’t really dad. You have to believe me.”

Sean now backed into the door of the building, which nudged open behind him.

A form stood inside, encased in a layer of shadow. Was it a park ranger? Was I mad? Did I just kill my father and traumatize my brother for life over nothing?

The figure stepped forward, reaching out for my brother. Emerging from the darkness, I recognized the figure: it was…me.

The other me grabbed Sean’s shoulder and pulled. Sean screamed. I ran to the door as fast as I could.

The amorphous face from last night – that had been me, a new me, forming just like dad’s replacement must have months ago. And it came into existence immediately after I looked into that mirror.

Sean bit into the hand of the other me, causing her to loosen her grip, and stumbled backwards outside. “Wait out here!” I hollered at him as I sprinted by, unsure if he would listen. I darted forward and dove at the other me, knocking us both to the ground.

The other me had my same circular face and green eyes, but she lacked the fright, stress, and horror that I remembered seeing in the mirror the previous night. I tried to grab her hands to restrain her, but she slammed her head into mine and knocked me onto the brittle floor, where I lay, stunned, near the hole I had formed last night. Remembering the knife I had left, I rolled close to the hole and reached down to find it.

“Looking for this?” I heard my own voice ring out. Turning, I saw her charge at me, knife in hand. I screamed as incredible pain coursed through my body as she jabbed the knife into the left side of my stomach. I looked down and saw blood gushing out and spilling down my shirt. I collapsed, dizzy.

The other me bent down, her face inches from mine. She held the knife, a slick sheen of my own blood on the blade. “This could have been so much easier.” My doppelganger’s voice had an empty, flat timbre. “Sean deserves better than you.”

She pulled the knife from my stomach. I cried out amidst the flood of hot, fresh pain. Her face, a perfect copy of mine, remained eerily placid. Her eyes were clinical and calculating, betraying none of the judgment I expected. “I am the superior sister.”

As she moved to strike again, I recognized her presence as something cold and alien, a creature that saw my humanity as nothing more than a weakness to be purged.

My right hand felt a strong, spherical object. Just as the other me began her next strike with the knife, I slammed a human skull from below into her face with all my remaining strength. The other me collapsed backwards, blood gushing down her forehead. “You bitch,” she stammered, stunned.

But she didn’t stay down. She didn’t have to. The unholy thing recovered almost instantly. Her eyes, still filled with that cold, empty calm, zeroed in on me as she sprang up and pounced, knocking the wind from my lungs. She slammed her hands down on my shoulders, pinning me to the floor as the skull rolled away.

“What’s happening?” Sean’s terrified voice rang out from the doorway. He stood there, frozen, his eyes wide, taking in the scene: me, bloody and gasping, pinned to the floor by a copy of myself wielding a bloody knife.

The doppelgänger turned her head to face Sean, her expression shifting to one of caring concern. “Thank God you’re okay,” she said, her voice smooth and soothing. “This…thing tried to attack me. She’s the one who killed dad. You need to help me restrain her.”

Panic seized me. I knew what she was doing. I struggled against her grip, but my body was weak, and the pain almost unbearable. “Sean, no,” I gasped. “Don’t listen to her! She…she came from the mirror. I need you to break it.”

Sean nervously glanced at the mirror as the doppelgänger spoke firmly. “Don’t listen to her. Sean, she’s trying to confuse you. You *know* me. You know that I’ve always been here for you, just like I’m here for you now. You can trust me.”

Tears welled in my eyes as waves of guilt and desperation washed over me. “Sean, please,” I choked out, ignoring the pain. “She’s *wrong*. You *can’t* trust me. I stole money meant for you. I’ve been a terrible older sister to you. For God’s sake, just run and get away from here, from both of us.”

Sean’s eyes darted between the two of us. Then, his gaze settled upon the skull on the ground. Slowly, deliberately, he picked it up, drew back his arms, and threw it at the mirror.

The glass shattered on impact. With a high-pitched, inhuman scream, the other me convulsed. She didn’t burn, bleed, or disintegrate…she just vanished. An eerie calm settled over the shack, broken only by my ragged breathing and the frantic flutter of my heart.

“Sean,” I called, weakly. He approached me tentatively, unsure of what to think. I mustered my depleted energy to whisper into his ear to take a path down to the water hole below, to follow the trail there to the road, and to get help.

As I lay on the ground, pushing my hand against the gushing wound, I felt the life drain out of me. Yet, overshadowing the immense pain was a creeping, suffocating terror as I thought of what lay behind the mirror that had shattered into a thousand pieces. Did the other me simply return to wherever she had originated? Was she still out there, waiting for another chance to emerge into my reality?

The blurred form of my brother grew smaller in my swimming vision. Sean was running away, just as I had told him. Unbeknownst to me, he would get help on time, and an emergency medical team would see to it that I'd be brought back from the precipice of death. But, in that moment, I just prayed that all the worst parts of me would bleed out in the cold dirt. And I hoped that the broken mirror had taken the rest of the monster with it, leaving a trail too faint for it to ever follow him [again](www.reddit.com/r/peacesim).
