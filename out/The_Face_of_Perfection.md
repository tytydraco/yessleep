Lying lifeless on the ground in this narrow street


All her belongings untouched , No harm done to the body except....


Only skinless flesh stays where her face was


The body gets taken away for autopsy


But they'll find nothing we don't already know


No fingerprints, No weapons , Just the missing face and the assumed reason of death


'victim bled to death'


A perfect crime 


These come to notice every once in a few months. Not enough for the authorities to look into , But enough for some curious cats to seek out. 


Was it fate that made this pattern stick out to me? or perhaps just dumb luck? Who knows


I started digging , Looking for cases outside my area.


It took a while.... weeks- no months. The cases were scattered around , The only thing common were the details....The missing faces.


The murders happen once every 2 weeks.  They wait atleast 3 months before committing one in the same area. No wonder this hasn't made it to major headlines yet.


These murders go back....Way back to the 19th century. The crimes did not follow any certain pattern back then , It seemed to be a bunch of individuals doing it without coordination.


That changed at the end of the 20th century, The murders suddenly started following schedules and a pattern of places almost as if.....they were organised.


A belief that makes people rip off other people's faces. Followed by individuals back in the 19th century , United by someone or something in the late 20th century.


I dug deeper , Deeper than I should've.


I took out a map and started plotting and that's when it hit.


All the places where the victims were found , They were close to manholes.


Manholes , A sewer system. 


Manholes are everywhere. Was it desperation that made me come to the conclusion? or perhaps some divine guidance? 


I didn't care. A lead was a lead. I just grabbed my flashlight and went.


I flashed my flashlight into the manhole , Heart beating out of my chest. I was scared , Scared that I'll end up like one of those faceless bodies. 


But curiosity really kills the cat. 


I dropped in , Into the sewers. Somewhere nobody will find me if I die.


I walked around , Not knowing which direction I should go. 


Was it really just dumb luck again? No way right? Maybe this is how it was meant to be. I was supposed to find them.


A light came into my sight. A light in the sewers , Unusual. 


I walked towards it , That's what I was there to do. 

A lantern , Outside a door. In the middle of the sewers. 


I slowly opened the door , A red light flashed into my face. 


After all this darkness , The sudden light dazzled me. The light that scared me for a second, It was beautiful. 


I walked in , The room was quiet. The red light engulfed the whole room.


There was something off , A smell. A smell I'm familiar with , Yet never got used to.


Rot... Rotting faces. The walls of the room , Covered in rotting faces of the victims.


My mind suddenly registered what I was seeing , I wanted to scream.


Before I could , I felt something bang against my head and everything went black.


I woke up , Tied to a chair. In the same room , The red light engulfing my face. 


"You did well seeking us out" 


My head hurts 


"You're confused. You don't understand."


I feel dizzy 


"We'll help you find yourself."


My head is about to blow. 


The next thing my mind registers. The man is holding something , Roughly the size of my face.....no- It is a face. 


"It's fresh , Lucky you." 


Next thing I know. There's this wet.... Cold feeling on my face. The face is being pushed into my face.


I panic for a moment....Just a moment.


The next second, I feel relief.


The man to whom this face belongs to , I see him.


I feel him.


He's with me.


No.


I'm him.


I feel it.


His pleasures, griefs , experiences , all mine in a second. 


I feel.... complete.


It's almost like I was missing a piece , Incomplete.


But suddenly I've received a piece , A step closer to being complete..... a step closer to being perfect.


The man holds up a mirror to my face. 


"Do you like it?" 


I see it. The face I was scared of for a second , It's beautiful. 


"We shall meet again"


I hear before drifting off. 


I wake up in my bed.


I know what I have to do.


Wait.


Wait for 2 weeks.


They will do it again.


I will find them.


I will be complete.


I will attain perfection.
