This morning, when I woke up, I hoped for a second that this had all been a bad dream, but I immediately saw that I was still in the house. I looked to the windows, and we were still in the middle of the forest. I must have been a bit too loud because both soon woke up too. We were all slowly emerging. Eventually, after looking around us in silence for a few minutes, we were all surprised by the sound of the front door opening. We stood up in a second and walked towards the entrance. We found ourselves face to face with the young lady, the one from the painting, the one that kissed me yesterday. We didn’t know what to say and started to step back. She was carrying 2 paper bags that seemed full. She looked at us with a slightly surprised look on her face, and then smiled.

 

“I didn’t think you’ll be awake already.” She said, casually. She lifted the bags she was holding. “It’s breakfast time!” She said.

 

We were all a bit flabbergasted. She was, I don’t know, sweet? I don’t know how else to say it, but her behavior was really warm.

 

“Now, come on, follow me, it’s time to eat, you must all be hungry.” She said, before walking past us towards the dining room.

 

We all looked at each other. Mr. Joseph started to whisper.

 

“Listen to me you two, I don’t know what’s happening, but don’t tell her anything about you, or, don’t let her, I don’t know,… We’re gonna try to break out of this, she might be the key…”

 

On that, we all went to the dining room. The young lady was unpacking her bags, and I was surprised to see her take out my favorite cereals: Golden Grahams. She also put some white bread, cassis jam, butter, and a cheesecake on the table. She looked at us.

 

“I took all your favorites.” She said, proudly. “And I’m going to make coffee for you Michael.” That’s how I learned that Mr. Joseph’s first name was Michael. “Joshua, Elizabeth, there’s orange juice right there on the table, serve yourself, I have another bottle in the fridge.”

 

She then went to the kitchen. We all sat at the table, and looked at each other, completely weirded out. I think none of us could predict that. A nice breakfast? It’s not really what you expect when you’re stuck in a supposedly haunted house.

 

The young lady soon came back with a cup of coffee and placed it in front of Mr. Joseph. She then sat with us and invited us to eat. I think we were all a bit anxious, but we were also crazy hungry, so we started to eat. I realized immediately that my Golden Grahams weren’t tasting like they usually did. I looked at the box and noticed that the design of the box was also not the one I was used to. Before I could ask myself more questions, the young lady answered it.

 

“It’s not the recipe you know, I’m sorry, that’s all there was.” She said.

 

I wasn’t gonna complain, so I just nodded and kept eating.

 

After some time, Mr. Joseph broke the silence.

 

“So, Miss, can I ask you a question?” He said. He was speaking very slowly.

 

“Ho, please, call me Anja, and of course, tell me.” She answered. I will now call her Anja, it’s easier.

 

“What are we doing here?” Asked Mr. Joseph.

 

Anja looked a bit embarrassed.

 

“Keeping me company, I guess.” She said.

 

“Do you plan on letting us go?” He asked.

 

“I would, but, it’s not really, I don’t really know how to say it… Let’s just say I need time before answering this question…”

 

There was a long silence.  Anja eventually broke it.

 

“Well, I’ll leave you finish, I got things to do…” She walked towards the hallway, and the sound of her walk slowly faded away.

 

We all let out a sigh of relief, like we had been holding our breath for an hour. It didn’t took a lot of time for Mr. Joseph to give us instructions. He told us to start looking around the house for any keys, or anything that would help him figure out what was going on. He asked us to stay together and to scream if anything was happening to us. We accepted and went upstairs, Mr. Joseph would be inspecting the main floor.

 

We entered the second bedroom, as we already looked at the first one the day before. We started to inspect the shelves and every drawers. We weren’t talking at all, before Elizabeth said the most unexpected shit ever considering our situation.

 

“Do you want to hook up?”

 

I honestly didn’t know what to say in the moment. She totally caught me off-guard. I finally answered her after a few seconds.

 

“How can you even think about that? What’s wrong with you?” I said. I was maybe a bit too harsh.

 

“God, I don’t know, I still feel like we’re about to die, so, I thought, I want to test it, why not now?” She said.

 

“Well, I’m fine, thanks, really, but I’m okay, sorry.” I said, hoping to end the conversation.

 

“How can you not want it? Are you gay or something?”

 

“I’m asexual. Is that okay? Is that okay or do you need me to write you an essay to justify myself?”

 

She looked surprised, then ashamed.

 

“I’m sorry, I’m all over the place, I didn’t mean to be rude…” She whispered.

 

“It’s okay, I understand.” I answered.

 

We kept looking everywhere, and for a while, we didn’t find anything. Eventually, Elizabeth got down and looked under a wardrobe. She let out a gasp and reached to grab something. It looked like a camera. Elizabeth said that it must be a pretty big clue, and that we should bring it to Mr. Joseph immediately.

 

We went down the stairs and found Mr. Joseph looking at something. When we arrived, he showed us what he had found.

 

“I went to the library, and there were some vinyls, and look what I found.” He showed us the pocket of the album. I recognized Ariana Grande’s face, eyes closed with a black background. I didn’t really understand what he meant, it was just an album. “Don’t you understand? That album, “See you around” from Ariana Grande, it doesn’t exist. And look at the date behind, 2029…” We didn’t know what to say. That was completely unexpected.

 

“Well, we found this.” Elizabeth handed the camera to Mr. Joseph.

 

“Does it still have battery?” He asked.

 

“We don’t know, we didn’t try it.” I said.

 

He opened it. There were a lot of videos, most of them were uninteresting, it looked like a family movie, about their vacations. Seeing the camera, and the videos, it was clearly from the early 2000’s. The man recording seemed to be the father, he stated in one of the videos that they were in the summer of 2002, confirming my theory. We eventually reached the end of the recordings. We didn’t know what to think of it. Mr. Joseph started to look in the files information, and saw something none of us could expect.

 

“Look you two.” He said, pointing the screen. We both approached it. Among the many information, one was strange: It said that the last video (they were just eating an ice cream, it seemed to be the last day before they go back home) was taken just one year ago. It didn’t make any sense.

 

To that point, we had two clues: an unknown Ariana Grande’s album from 2029, and a camera with a video from 2002, that said it was shot just a year ago.

 

We all sat, trying to figure things out. Eventually, I thought to my little sister, Rosa. I told her that I was sleeping to a friend’s house the day before, so she wasn’t worried. It looked like I wouldn’t be going back home tonight either, so, I decided to send her a little text to justify my absence tonight. Here’s a copy paste of our conversation:

 

*Me: Hey, sorry im not back home, I will be sleeping at my friend’s again, dont worry*

 

*Rosa: LOL, what are you saying?*

 

*Me: What?*

 

*Rosa: Ure home???*

 

*Me: WDYM??*

 

*Rosa: what?? You’re upstairs?? Its not even funny…*

 

I was completely shocked. If what she said was true, she was probably in danger. I immediately asked Elizabeth for her phone. I entered my phone number in WhatsApp and video called myself. My phone started ringing, but I didn’t answer it. Then, it stopped, and someone answered. On Elizabeth’s phone, I could see myself, in my room. I was completely shocked by what I was seeing. My double was looking straight to me through the phone. He started to smile, a creepy smile. He laughed.

 

“I was wondering when you would be calling…” I could see his teeth were dirty and pointy, like a monster, he was terrifying. “I met our sister, Rosa. She’s very sweet… I can’t wait to have a taste of her…” He started to lick his own teeth.

 

“Don’t you approach her, you hear me?!”  I screamed.

 

“Ho, or what?” He asked, mocking me. “You can’t do anything… except kill yourself.”

 

“What?” I said.

 

“You heard me, if you kill yourself, I won’t be able to use your identity, so, you could do that…” He laughed and hung up.

 

I was terrified. I immediately started to write Rosa’s number in Elizabeth’s phone and started a video-call. She answered immediately. I had trouble explaining her where I was, and I knew the clock was probably ticking. I told her that whatever was with her, wasn’t me, and that she had to leave, now. I told her to go to Claire’s house. Claire was a friend of her. Claire had recently disappeared, and I knew that her parents were a bit wealthy, but also had cops around their house most of the time because of the disappearance of Claire. I didn’t know if they would welcome her, but that was my best idea in the moment. She had trouble understanding me, but also believing me, but she eventually agreed to do what I told her. She packed a few things and left. Before we hung up, I heard my double calling her from upstairs. His voice was malicious, and I told her to run as fast as she could and to call me back when she got to Claire’s house.

 

After the call, I realized my eyes were filled, and I broke down in tears. I saw that Elizabeth and Mr. Joseph were scared, but they both tried to comfort me. Elizabeth shyly put her hand on my back, and Mr. Joseph gave me a warm but small hug. It was clearly a teacher’s hug: comforting, but as appropriate and distant as possible. This awkward moment reminded me how much we were all strangers to each other.

 

After a few seconds, we heard footsteps coming from the stairs. Anja was coming down. She looked at us, worried.

 

“I heard some screams, is everything okay?” She said.

 

I didn’t think about it, I ran towards her, ready to beat the shit out of her. I jump on her and made her fell on the ground, she didn’t looked scared, just surprised. I started punching her in the face as hard as I could. I soon realized that my punch didn’t leave any trace, and she didn’t even look in pain.

 

“What is happening?” She asked.

 

“What did you do to my sister?” I said.

 

“Nothing! I did nothing, what’s happening?!” She said.

 

“Someone is pretending to be him, he’s gonna try to hurt his sister!” Said Elizabeth.

 

“Ho, no…” Anja said. She looked at me. “Don’t kill yourself.” She told me.

 

She softly pushed me out of her way, and got up.

 

“What is she doing now?” She asked me. “Your sister! What is she doing? Where is she?”

 

“Huh, I told her to run away to somewhere safer, she’s going now.” I answered.

 

“She’s gonna try to follow her…” Anja whispered to herself. She looked at me. “I’m going to try to help her.” She said.

 

She went straight to the hallway and stood in front of a painting of a family, looked like ot was from the Renaissance. She took a deep breath and started to violently destroy and shatter the painting with her hands. While she was doing so, she was letting out screams of pain, that were getting louder and louder. As she continued, the faces in the paintings became angry, and their disgusting monstruous arms came out of the frame and tried to grab Anja, but she was resisting and kept on breaking the painting. Eventually, the arms got back inside the painting, and an old woman came out of it. She almost looked like a skeleton and was so dirty, she looked like she was from a nightmare (before you say so, she didn’t look like the owner at all). She screamed and violently pushed Anja away from the frame. Anja was thrown at the wall and fell on the floor. The old woman slowly got back inside the painting and it fixed itself.

 

It was suddenly all silent, and we were all shocked. We looked at Anja. She was bleeding, covered in wounds all over her body. It wasn’t coming from the people in the painting, they didn’t hurt her, just tried to grab her, and it wasn’t from the old woman either, she only pushed her away. Anja looked at herself, and this time, we could see she was in pain. She looked up to me.

 

“It should have buy your sister some time…” She said. She got up on her feet with difficulty. “I need to take care of a few things now…” She went through the door to the dining room, and just like that, she wasn’t there anymore.

 

We were all shocked and didn’t know what to do, so we all sat at different places. We were processing, and I was eagerly waiting for Rosa to call me back. I figured I could update everyone on here while waiting for her call, so, here it is.
