“You know what my favorite part of it all was, Choir-Boy? Watching your brain start to turn on itself. 

Watching you talk to thin-air, hide bodies, convince yourself something else murdered those intruders . It was beautiful. 

When you called in a Sneopman to try and get you free, that was my favorite. Your ancestors must be spinning in their graves. 

Wish I got an angle on how you killed those burglars, but that’s the way the cookie crumbles I guess. “ I hear the Bishop gloat through the vents. 

When I heard Cameras, I was confused. Last time I checked they were loud things the size of bricks, cost upwards of 5 thousand dollars, and were installed in banks and dangerous party stores. 

If I could smile, I would be. 

I wasn’t made as early as I’d been assuming. My creator, half assed as she may be, had cameras in mind. 

Think back to when I was trying to work through the vantablack barriers. 

Today, from what I’ve read ,cameras are everywhere. Whoever my creator is, she had that in mind. I don’t think cameras can see me. 

My body rattles slightly, fear and panic trying to force rational through from my stitched together mind. 

I send Kaz a text, not willing to risk calling. 

“Bishop had the place wired up with cameras. Knows about you, but not me. Do not come. Walking into a trap. Don’t know how much he knows. “ I type. 

The minutes before the reply feel like days. 

“GET OUT NOW. It won’t be long before he figures out Leo wasn’t hallucinating. “ is Kaz reply. 

Unfeeling monster is a cliché so overused, just reading that probably made you skip a paragraph. 

From personal experience I can tell you it’s total horse-shit. I’m, by any metric, a monster. I own that. But the fear I felt trying to get out of that house, it was real. 

Every tiny footfall sounded like a gunshot, every rustling leaf, every cough I could hear from a block away, it invoked a sense of dread. At any moment I knew I would suddenly feel a tentacle wrap around me, and be dragged back into that house. 

But eventually, I found myself standing at the door to an upscale candy shop in a very downtrodden neighborhood.

There was a sign that was yellowed and curled from time and light. Written in immaculate cursive was  “Closed for family emergency. “ .

Kaz lets me in, and as the door closes I stand in shock. 

The first thing that hits me is the smell. I’ll be the first to admit, spilled blood gets my engine running, but the rotten, nearly tactile reek of decaying flesh makes my vestigial digestive system try to run in reverse. 

Then I see it. 

Bodies, half rotten and cocooned in some kind of whispy, tarry, black substance. 

  I know I shouldn’t have been shocked, I’m in a world of blood and magic. But I guess I’d gotten to think of Kaz as just, a nice guy. 

“A Regrettable part of being who I am. “ Kaz offers by way of an explanation. 

I can’t shake the shock. I know it’s hypocritical as hell, but the, desecration of the bodies, the, serial killer vibe of it all , I can’t let it go. 

“What do we do now?” I say, still staring at the corpse collection. 

“We tried things Leo’s way, now we tap our world. “ Kaz says, there’s a tone of trepidation in his voice. 

“Why do you sound like you hate that idea?” I ask, noticing one corpse is still moving slightly. 

“Punch, you, me, Leo, we are the odd men out. 

What you are staring at is me making a half dozen kills last a decade. I’m starving, constantly. I’m poor, and I’m isolated. All it would take to remedy all of these issues is to spill some more blood, and ruin a few more lives. 

You, I can still smell the shame on you from killing those people. I can smell the fear of what you could become. 

And Leo? That guy is a strange duck just based on the fact he was willing to have a conversation with us. He can hide it behind all of the Archie Bunker type attitude he wants, but he’s one of the good ones. 

In our world, it’s hard to be strange, ironic as that may be. The society behind society runs on rules, ritual and tradition. 

Reaching out for help isn’t going to be as simply as you think. “ Kaz admits. 

“What am I not getting?” I ask, impatiently. 

“You are an experiment, Leo is a soldier, I’m an oddity. 

The only person I can think of that can help, is a demon. “ Kaz says, sitting in a somehow clean leather office chair. 

“Demon, as in, pitch forks and red skin? From the bible? How’s something like that possible?” I question, not quite buying it. 

“No pitch fork, no red skin, think more, biblically accurate. 

And as to how that book can hold weight in a world like ours. 

If something is powerful enough to fit the description, and chooses to make the effort to, I don’t think it matters much. 

I don’t know if there is a god, Abrahamic or no,  but I’ve met my share of demons.” Is Kaz’ answer. 




A few phone calls later and we find ourselves standing at the door of what looks to be an active meat packing plant. Pretty much the opposite of the rust flecked, ominous structure you’d guess. Well lit, active, and with security manning several guard stations. 

Kaz carries me, sneaking to the complex in the middle of the night seems old hat to him. 

The young, dark skinned man working the booth doesn’t so much as blink when he sees the collection of horrifying features Kaz calls a face. 

“First floor, back corner, east side. 

Boss wanted me to say, ‘ If you’re not early, you’re late’. “ the man says, almost bored. 

I don’t like the nervous body language I see in Kaz. 

A metal gate that’s pristine looking but squeaks open none the less lets us through. 

Have you ever wandered into the wrong part of a town you’ve never been to?

I’m not talking somewhere you’ve been mugged, or had a bad experience, but one of those places where bad things happen so deep in the shadows, they stay there. 

It has a feeling, doesn’t it? A sense of violence and danger beyond any obvious signs. 

That’s what this place feels like. And all those little bits and bobs of the arcane that make me more than a garage sale find thrum with the evil energy permeating it. 

A massive metal roll-up gate takes it’s time to reveal what I’ll start by describing as something ‘man-shaped’.

It has a grin, the kind of hateful rictus mask that seems to escape the edges of it’s malformed skull. 

It’s eyes are sunken back, scrutinizing from deep within black pits, the yellowed, dry flesh around them cracked and bleeding, as if trying to contain something within. 

Black claw like nails, corpse pallor skin, the thing stood nearly eight feet tall. A parody of the human form. 

For a second I look at it with my new eye. 

The hardware has no problem discerning what’s in front of me,  it transmits the signal to a mind that’s still nothing more than meat. 

Burning pain, a nonsensical image that sits at the front of my brain like a fresh brand. 

And the knowledge. The horrible, fucking knowledge. 

Seeing what it was, truly, even for the briefest of moments, it’s not something you shake off.

When I go back to looking at the lumpen, terrifying thing in front of me, I understand, it’s nothing more than the demon’s way of communicating with us. A minor, almost vestigial appendage that lets us beg at it’s feet. 

“Kaz, you old motherfucker, it’s been a while! And you brought me a gift?” The thing says pointing to me. It’s deep voice has a command that goes beyond charisma. 

  “No Pi, this is a friend of mine, I didn’t know how…cultured your workers may have been So I played things subtle. “ Kaz responds, letting go of me. 

“Well come in, have a look at the new digs. Lets see what I can do for you. “ Pi says, motioning us inside the massive building. 

At first things look normal, just about what you’d expect from a meat packing plant. But the second that roll down door shut, it was like a switch flipped. 

Suddenly all around me are cultists and victims. Dozens of people, strapped down or hanging from bloody hooks. Cultists cutting, burning, chanting and flensing. One massive ongoing ritual. 

The floor is covered in a quarter inch of blood, hunched backed cultist mill about mopping and attempting to minimize the offal and fluids on the floor. 

The cultists give pi a wide berth, and seem not show no surprise at either Kaz or myself.   

Screams ring out as pi walks us back to a modular office. 

The carpet is pure white, and as pi opens the door, two cults scramble to place  thick disposable towels under our feet as we enter. Once we’re seated , the cultists stand, motionless at the side of the room. Masked and seeming more like furniture than people. 

It takes me a moment to notice the bound, shirtless, pale man in the corner. There is terror in his eyes, and fresh wounds over his malnourished body. His face has jester’s makeup either branded or newly tattooed on it. 

“ Who’s that?” Kaz says casually , pointing to the bound man. 

“That’s the meat puppet the last scraps of Jack the ripper escaped into. 

Been a hell of a time trying to get ol’ Demitreious out, but we’re making progress. “ Pi explains as the man tries to scream and plead through a blood stained ball-gag. 

“I thought he was dead ten times over. Crafty old lich. “ Kaz replies. 

“Me too, looking to get some favors out of this situation. 

Speaking of favors, what do you need Kaz?” Pi asks. 

I can tell something about the demon’s tone is making Kaz nervous. 

“Nothing I’m not ready and willing to pay for in full. “ Kaz says. 

“Right, let no one say you don’t pay your debts. 

But, I have to ask. What’s the nature of the request? Is this another one of your pet projects?” Pi’s tone gets somewhat sinister as he talks. 

“I’ve crossed paths with a malignant that is not receptive to reason. I need someone who can make a stronger case than myself. “ Kaz replies, dodging the question. 

Pi takes a long inhale, tension builds. 

“Kaz, I like you. We’ve known each other for over a century.

The thing is, when you come to me, it’s never for things that will advance the cause. You never want to expand your domain, or cause chaos. 

Kaz, my friend, you’ve gotten boring. 

We are here for very specific reasons, and the more I think of it, the more it offends me you want to pretend that isn’t the case. “ Pi is locking eyes with Kaz as he talks. 

“Pi, what’s all this? You know me, you know I don’t want to have to be butting heads with the likes of you to try and gain position. “ Kaz sounds nervous.

“With what’s coming down the pipe, I don’t know if attitudes like yours will be very helpful. 

Walk with me Kaz.” Pi stands as he says this.

As I hop from the white leather chair to join him and Kaz, a single drop of blood falls from my shoe, hitting the plush, pristine carpet. 

A cultist tries to dive and catch it, towel held out, but fails. He’s shaking and frozen with fear as pi looks over. 

To call what that masked person received a beating would be vastly understating things. Bones break under an  inhuman torrent of blows, sick joy spreads across Pi’s face as he leaves the cultists damned to a slow brutal death on the floor. 

Pi leads us out a door in the back of an office, and we are standing in a long, wide hallway. On either side of us cells. Thick iron bars, some etched with runes and shifting symbols cage in things more, and less than human. All hurt, screaming, and trying their best to escape. 

“On the horizon is a war. One that will make the battle between heaven and hell look like a bar-fight. 

Those that survive will be the strong, those with power, and cunning. 

And they will need soldiers. Willing or no. 

This will be my army. “ Pi says, gesturing to those in the cages around him. 

“Pi, if I’ve done anything to offend, or came at the wrong time, I apologize. 

I’ll be on my way, I didn’t mean to impose. “ Kaz says, trying to stop what feels like a very bad situation. 

Pi stops and stands silent. 

“Kaz, you don’t get to back out of a deal. You know this. 

You get your favor, but I want more than just compensation. I want to see that you still have that drive, that spark. I want to see that you are someone who deserves to survive.

Give me the Pipe-Bomb. Haven’t been able to acquire one of my own, and I have a feeling the cultists could figure out a lot if they could pull it apart. “ As Pi makes his demand my heart sinks. If I could sweat I’d be soaked. 

Kaz attempts to laugh things off. 

“He’s more than just a construct. The creator left a lot of personality in there and he’s a friend of mine. 

I can have you a handful of humans in an hour or so.” Kaz offers. 

“You know who’s my friend Kaz?

The Bishop. 

And you coming to me asking me to intervene puts me in an awkward situation. 

I don’t need more meat, I have more than I know what to do with. I need your little friend. Those are my terms. “ Pi turns around, the screams from the cells echo, providing hellish background music. 

“Kaz, I’ve got this. Out of the two of us you are more likely to pull things off. 

And to be honest, maybe I’m sick of having a 90’s slacker mind, and 90’s slasher urges. “ I mean what I say, but it doesn’t make the terror any less. 

“The Pipe-Bomb gets it. 

Now, what do you need Kaz?” Pi asks. 

Kaz looks to me, guilt and shame on his face. He then turns toward Pi. 

“The bishop is planning something large. And he has a friend of mine. I need the man saved, and the malignant dissuaded from his current course of action. “ Kaz is monotone, defeated. 

Pi begins to laugh, an otherworldly sound that full of hate, that comes from every angle. When he stops, his voice is thick with rage and evil. 

“Didn’t believe it when I heard. Thought there had to me more to things. 

But I just wanted to hear it with my own ears, or as close as I can get anyway. 

You sad, broken failure. You twisted little runt. You had so much potential, so much power and promise. 

But it’s wasted. 

You come here, and ask of me, on the dawn of war, to provide aid and succor to the line of those that have hunted us since time began. 

You’re dead to me Kaz” 

The door to the cell to our left slowly creeks open of it’s own accord. 

“Don’t make me ask.” Pi says, by way of demand. 

We don’t.  The sense of rising evil and power all around us, is plenty of incentive to not argue.


Other than the cultists, we see individuals in black security gear. All of them seem slightly off, we quickly realize it’s the guards. All tainted by Pi’s essence.

Within an hour a gurney is wheeled in by two guards and a three eyed humanoid in medical garb. 

You’d think being resilient to harm would be nothing but a boon. I can’t think of anyone who wouldn’t want to be able to shrug off a shotgun blast. 

One thing I bet none of you have thought about is just how much worse this could make torture. 

They rip, burn and tear at Kaz form. The surgeon is an artist of pain. Using equipment that ranges from surgical to industrial to decimate my friend. 

Kaz screams, loud enough to rattle the bars of the cell. The noise, in any other context would be blood curdling, the type of hollow bellow that would make grown men afraid of the dark. But here, all it means is pain and betrayal. 

When they finish, they toss Kaz broken form on the ground like so much garbage. He’s alive, but one hand isn’t coming back, and his body is hastily knitting together enough broken bones to make him sound like a thawing pond. 

Snickering, the guards leave us in the gore stained cell. 

I can’t focus as conflicting thoughts, urges, and feelings hit me all at once. I’m enthralled by the violence in the warehouse, scared witless by the situation we’re in , and on some small, deep buried level, wanting to pledge myself to Pi. 

At first I think the vibrating is my heart. That the stress of everything has finally gotten to me, and I’m going to die, less like Chucky and more like Fred Sanford. 

But I don’t have a heart. Literally anyway.  

As the fear and panic begins to dull, I realize it’s my phone. 

“And much to my surprise the demon betrays you. “ I hear jp say after I’ve accepted the call, “ You’ve got some surveillance equipment in you little fella, outdated enough I’ve been able to keep an eye on you guys. 

Figured you’d try and stab Leo in the back eventually. “

“Can you bust us out?” I text back. 

“ Oh fuck no. First off, I’m not risking my life for the likes of you two. 

And more to the point, the Greysmiths aren’t soldiers. We have connections, knowledge, we make things, but I’m not Leo. 

Did you see a tall, thin guy, maybe in clown makeup?” JP asks. 

“Yeah, but he didn’t look in any state to fight. “ I reply. 

JP snickers. 

“He wouldn’t, your buddy has been putting him through the ringer. But that Pagliacci looking fuck is sitting on more power than he knows. 

I’ve got a man on the inside that can get him free, and give him a box of some of my best party favors. 

He should be able to create enough of a shitstorm for you two to sneak out, and the three of us to get Leo. 

Once he does though, your buddy, he’s going to go scorched earth. That place is going to turn into Lovecraft’s wet dream. 

Beyond that, those people, the victims. Half will probably snap, and the rest, well, they won’t see you as any different than any of the other evil shit there. 

What I’m saying is, even if you two make it, you’ll be getting your hands dirty. “ As JP says his plan, Kaz tries to sit, his hips are still fractured, and falls, screaming. 

“Doesn’t seem like there is much of a choice. “ I text back. 

“Trust me, if there was, I wouldn’t your ass out of the fire. “ JP replies. 

And that’s where I am, a dying phone, a possibly dying friend, and my only hope is some sketchy promises from a man that claims to be Q but seems more Q anon. 

As always, if anyone has any ideas, let me know. So far listening to those around me, hasn’t exactly got me in the best situation.
