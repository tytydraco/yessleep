Some background: I live in a suburb in the Midwest US. This telling of events greatly concerns my cat, named Crickets. He was named after the way I found him, getting crickets at a pet shop for my late lizard.  
Crickets was 3 years old, in a little cage, and looked malnourished. I suspect some form of abuse, but never asked. Just bought the guy. I felt bad.  
He was a beautiful shade of orange, and yowled every morning at 4am sharp until I let him in my room and allow him to rub up against all my dark clothes and purr like a motorboat.  
I leave for work at 6am, so this was not welcome. I could sleep through it most days, though. He was 11 when these events happened, and I got more experience with cats than I ever thought I would as a 30-something geology major.  
Back to the street cats.  
About a month ago, I noticed there were dozens more cats on the street than usual. They weren’t acting like any cats I’d ever seen before. They were more pack-like, eerily well-coordinated for what should be lone hunters.  
Every morning, about when I heard Crickets’ yowls, I’d get up and see the pack sweeping the street. They’d move like a fluid, washing away any debris or slow, small animal that they passed by.  
... Into their mouths.  
It wasn’t a pretty sight, but I’m sure the neighbors who woke up late were happy with the cleaner streets.  
I was trying to keep a log of how many cats were in the pack each day, but the things kept moving in a rotating formation that made focus difficult. Like gears turning and moving forward, and each of the spokes is a cat. It was mesmerizing, but the shit they were eating took me out of that pretty quick. The most I’d counted was 47, but there were at least a dozen more in that pack.  
They were always wet, too. Not like “fell into a puddle” wet, but like “4 months without a shower” kind of wet. Like they swam in vegetable oil. And the oil they were covered in smelled like a mixture of vomit and sewage.  
Fast forward to a week or so ago.  
I was called in early for work. I was up at 3:45 and out by 4, missing Crickets’ morning routine.  
When I got back home, all the windows on the ground floor were wide open or smashed. I always close and lock them, so I was immediately panicking. Nothing seemed to be stolen, but I smelled that awful street cat smell. One of them must have wandered in at some point.  
I checked more closely at what could be missing.  
Crickets was gone.  
He didn’t have his collar on that day because, well, I locked the door. He shouldn’t be able to get out of a locked house.  
That day, as I was trying to wind down, I was checking the neighborhood’s community Facebook. Everyone who owned a cat had tampered-with windows and their cat(s) were gone. All in one night.  
At this point, I was wracking my brain trying to figure out a motive for something like this, and the logistics of pulling it off. Whoever did this, they had to be at each house in one night, open/smash the windows silently, then take the cat from the household without alerting the owners. Some people on the forum even said their cats slept in the bed with them, so this guy had to sneak into a room with sleeping occupants and steal their cat without waking anyone up. Even if we ignore the stealth issue, how the hell did this guy move dozens of unfamiliar, and likely protective, cats without a trace?  
Also, the motive. Why? Why would anyone need to take over fifty cats? Is there some kind of animal sacrifice cult? Some new cat-borne disease that needed immediate eradication?  
The police, along with everyone else, were completely stumped and useless. I was the only one that seemed to think about the correlation between the daily cat swarm and the disappearances.  
If anyone else thought of it, they didn’t do anything with the thought before I did.  
Yesterday morning, I was off work. I got fed up with the mystery of it all and followed where the cats were going. They’d swept each street they went through, and went on for a good 4-5 miles before they started filing into an abandoned brick building. There was a wooden cellar door that had rotted open, and all of them filed one by one into the hole.  
Something about how coordinated the cats were, especially up close, made me feel so unsettled.  
This felt unnatural.  
… I mean, no shit.  
I had to know what was down there. I’d come too far to turn back in this investigation. I went home to get some supplies. A flashlight, a bag of water bottles and a few power bars, and a little peashooter that looked like it couldn’t kill a rat point-blank, but I was still nervous holding it.  
When I went back to the abandoned building, there was no immediately noticeable trace of the cats except for that vomit/sewage smell. The room immediately following the cellar door was a four-sided room full of rusty drums, and pipes coming out of all sides of them. They were slowly leaking what I can only assume was that awful oil.  
There were 2 doorways, one right on the wall in front of me, and another to my left.  
There was a lot of evidence of foot (or, paw) traffic going to the front doorway, so I started there.  
My sense of dread kept getting stronger as I got further into what I now suspected to be an abandoned factory of sorts.  
I followed the trail of dirt and glistening oil to a padlocked steel door at the end of a small hallway.  
The Plexiglass window was opaque from the years of neglect, but I saw a large object moving constantly back there, accompanied with metallic whirs and crunches. The bottom of the door had a 1 inch gap, but I did not want to get close to the ground to look under it with all this shit on the floor. I argued with myself for a few minutes before conceding and going back home to get a big pair of bolt cutters.  
When I got back, the door was unlocked.  
The lock was on the floor, undone.  
I started scanning the walls behind me for anyone or anything that could be watching me. Pairs of glints, in every doorway, ducking out of sight before the focus of the flashlight unobscured them.  
From the bottom of a door frame, darting to a blind spot.  
From a platform around the corner, out of eyesight.  
From the top of the door frame, to the ceiling.  
... Fuck.  
Through some form of adrenal stupidity, I ran into the ajar steel door, away from the eyes, but towards whatever huge thing I saw a few hours ago.  
This room was massive, and filled with heavy machinery and all manner of heavily used cat enrichment tools. It must have been the main area of the factory.  
I watched as a mottled brown and white cat darted out between my feet, towards a decrepit cat tower. It fumbled it’s way through the inside of the tower, and on the top, it turned to face me.  
The bastard had no lower jaw, and a fifth, hairless leg was curving out of it’s throat. The sound that came out of this thing was like a deeper hiss, but mixed with the sound of someone gargling.  
It ran away just as I processed what I was looking at, and by the time I was done vomiting, it was gone.  
Adrenaline and curiosity were the only things keeping me at all composed at this point.  
Something I didn’t notice before, there was one platform in the back of the room, about fifty feet in the air, with what looked like levers, lights, and other controls. All of the machines had reddish wires either coming from it, or going to it.  
Floodlights turned on above me.  
The entire room was completely visible now.  
My adrenaline stash, wherever that is in the brain, was running on empty. I had no additional heart rate increase when I saw what lied on the platform, but not because I didn't panic.  
On the platform was a pink-reddish humanoid. It looked skinless. Through all of this encounter, the figure never moved from the platform.  
The figure spoke in a deep, bassy voice through loudspeakers in the rafters.  
“What have you brought for me, my little ones? A morsel? A friend? A new schematic?”  
The cats bolted, spike-furred, across the steel beams and away from the speakers. A chorus of discordant meows resounded from every corner of the room.  
The five-legged cat I saw earlier was now perched next to the figure, staring down at me.  
“Whichever it may be, your diligence, Children, will be rewarded. Purity will be awarded to those that brought this man.”  
Several cats sped from behind me and from under machinery to the opening of a conveyor belt. They all sat down at once. The figure interacted with the controls in front of it, and the conveyor belt began to move.  
I watched as the cats, stoic despite the ground under them moving, were brought into a chamber past a door of rubber strips. Heavy machinery noise and steam erupted from the device. The tubes connected to the machines were tossed around with the changing of pressure. I couldn’t tell where the cats came out, if they did at all.  
“What drove you to keep investigating, given the clear disgust you had for my scions?” It said as it stroked the five-legged thing.  
I couldn’t respond. Shock had taken over and I was not able to react.  
“You clearly had a purpose coming here. Nobody follows a cat into a hole without a reason.”  
I choked out a sound, and that seemed to throw off a bit of the shock. I could respond now, despite my constant stuttering.  
“I-I wanted to know what was happening in my neighborhood. Cats were disappearing, there were cats sweeping the streets,--”  
“They hunt because they cannot gather. They consume in droves so they may feel a sense of legion. They left you because they wanted more. More than hunting pebbles in bowls and rotting in solitude.”  
I stuttered my way through another line of questioning.  
“Why are all of the cats here? What happened to them?”  
“They’re not in pain or in death, if that was your concern.”  
“There are families out there missing their pets. Why are they here?”  
“To put it simply, they are not themselves. They have been reincarnated into more pure beings than the scum you call your pets.”  
Cats were staring at me from every corner I could see.  
I felt a shockwave of icy blood sweep my body. The spacing of the glints weren’t all in pairs.  
I flinched as the machine the cats had entered abruptly began to hum increasingly louder. The maroon tubes that connected the machines darkened in stripes. Something was moving through them.  
I watched as 5 to 7 shapes exited the machine one by one, a metallic grinding sound preceding them.  
I hesitate to call the shapes I saw 'cats'.  
One of them had patchy fur, teeth along it’s spine, and exposed organs. Another had it’s front legs coming out of the eye sockets and it’s fur was entirely replaced by whiskers.  
My memory has graciously blocked most of the details regarding the rest, but one other cat stands out.  
One with no eyes, an abnormally large mouth with bone fragments for teeth, eight triple-jointed legs...  
And a full coat of beautiful orange fur.  
The figure outstretched it's arms and lifted it's head to face the ceiling.  
“Purity. The grandest forms of life these beings will ever achieve. Once useless pests, now akin to the Seraphim.”  
The wave of emotions I felt in this moment was unparalleled. Shattered faith, grief, rage, confusion, disgust, despair, emptiness. Any negative emotion was present.  
But Rage took center stage, bowed, and performed like it had practiced for years.  
I pulled out the pistol from my backpack’s side pocket and emptied it, aiming at the figure. Each bullet that landed brought a pained cry from the figure and yowls from each cat in the building.  
Unrecognizable creatures and filthy cats fell from the rafters and landed with abrupt, sickening, wet thuds.  
A ricochet blew out one of the pressurized tubes, making a deafening, hollow slam. For the next minutes, everything sounded like I was underwater.  
I reloaded, almost dropping the clip from my shaking hands. I continued firing.  
I gave pause when I recognized one of the caterwauls. I resumed my volley with a blunt pain in my throat that I hadn’t felt since the worst moments of my childhood.  
I only fully relented when I thought I landed a shot and the figure made no sound. Neither did the cats, which all laid motionless in the position their limp bodies settled to.  
The only sound in the room now was the pounding of blood in my ears and their piercing tinnitus.  
I collapsed onto the factory floor, and passed out with glossy eyes.  
\~ \~ \~  
I awoke on a hospital bed, well-dressed men and a woman in a gown towering over me.  
The police, news crews, and doctors all told me the same thing.  
I was found on the floor of the warehouse, unresponsive, peashooter in hand.  
They claimed the oil found in the factory was cheaply stored and highly hazardous, and the fumes caused me to hallucinate, and may have caused, quote: 'Intense memory problems'. Not very professional terms.  
The news picked up on the story of a man found unresponsive in an abandoned factory, having fired two clips worth of ammunition at hallucinations. The reporters laughed with fake smiles the whole way through. I saw in the papers that a lot of the old staff quit that same day.  
I didn't have any of the answers I wanted at all, and the city seemed like they wanted to keep it that way. A tear down + hazardous waste disposal order was issued for the factory within the week. They didn’t care about the “structural/pollution hazard” nine years ago when I moved here.  
I knew I had to go then and there. Police tape, traffic cones, temporary fences, and a half-dozing security guard could not deter me.  
I choked back apprehension and vomit while reentering the wooden trap door, making my way to the main room of the factory, moving past the pitch-black doorways, cat droppings, and the broken lock, and finally entering the main room.  
The eight-legged monstrosity that bore my pet's orange fur was motionless in a shallow puddle of oil, near the tail end of the machine that it emerged from.  
I put on my gloves and pulled off a tuft of the fur, which nauseatingly slid out without resistance.  
I put the fur into an airtight mason jar I had brought for this purpose.  
As I began to leave with the last piece of Crickets, my only physical part of him, I hesitated as my back was turned to the rest of the room, hearing sliding noises getting closer.  
I felt a thud against the back of my shoe.  
I sprinted out without looking back.  
The factory was demolished the next day. No trace of anything strange after the police combed the rubble, as the police claimed.  
On quiet nights recently, though, I've been hearing those same sliding sounds from inside the factory when I have a window open.  
I listened closer one of those nights, just out of morbid curiosity.  
I heard a second sound.  
A little motorboat.
