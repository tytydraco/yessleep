“Hey Sarge, can I see you for a minute?”


I had taken half a step towards the cell when Officer Marshal stuck a meaty paw out to stop me.


“Don’t engage him. It’s best to just ignore that one.”


I nodded, feeling a little bad about just blowing the guy off as we got back to counting inmates.


It was my first day in confinement and I wanted to make a good impression on the guys I’d be spending a lot of time with in the near future. Corrections was not a job I had ever seen myself doing, but after college, I didn’t have as many prospects as I thought I would. I could go work at the diner, I could work at the hardware store, I could work as a laborer at one of the local farms, or I could pack up and move somewhere with better job prospects. I wasn’t really opposed to leaving Cashmere, it was a small town without a lot going for it, but I wasn't in a place where I could afford to leave at the moment. I started looking for jobs in other cities, and that's when I stumbled across the posting for Stragview.


After looking at the pay range, I started making a plan. With the sign-on bonus and the pay grade, I could work there for the next two to three years and have enough money saved up move myself across the state, and set myself up in a job that actually interested me. What's more, the Security certification I got from the training would look good in my portfolio and maybe open up my prospects with employers. So I signed up, took the ninety-day training certification, and started my two-year tour at Stragview Penitentiary.


After a few shifts of coming to work on time and not being a totally worthless human being, my captain asked me if I wanted to try my hand at confinement. He said he had a lot of brutes and manhandlers but not a lot of guys willing to have a conversation with an inmate and maybe talk them out of dumb stuff. His last one had, apparently, gone home and murdered his whole family before winding up here for execution, and he had mostly had brutes back there after that.


“You and Marshall can good cop/bad cop these guys a little and maybe I won’t have to fill out use of force paperwork every night on some dumb ass in G dorm.”


I agreed and here I was in The Show as they called it.


We finished counting the three quads and when we got back to the station the grizzled old sergeant went for a smoke.


“Keep an eye on two,” he mumbled, patting Marshall on the arm as he left.


I had taken a seat in one of the ancient old chairs they kept there, Marshall sitting behind the bank of cameras that made up our new surveillance post and turned to look at me. He steepled his fingers, trying to choose his words carefully, and I immediately got a little nervous. I had been told that Marshall was a little ornery, a little hard to get along with, but he seemed fine to me. The two of us had talked about strategy games and fantasy novels, Marshall was as big a Salvator fan as I was, and when they had called count, we had gone out to the floor like we’d done it a thousand times before.


Now he had something to impart to me, it seemed, and I hoped that I hadn’t screwed up so soon after going out.


“I’m only gonna say it once, but I want you to listen. I’m not trying to tell you your business, I’m not trying to scare you, but I don’t want you to get hurt. The inmate in G1-01 is best avoided at all costs.”


I nodded, but internally I breathed a sigh of relief. He was just talking about the guy I had started to talk to. The guy was probably a lifer or someone who liked to mess with new guys. I had seen a story in training about “Downing the Duck” and I figured it was in the same vein as that. Once he talked to you, you were already hooked and eventually, he’d real you in.


“That's inmate,” I tried to remember his name but Marshall beat me to it.


“James Tiberius Bombicus.” he spoke the name like an incantation against evil, “He has been a resident of G1 for the last year and a half, and for the last year and two months, I have tried to get him sent elsewhere. The man is a menace, a manipulator, and he will waste your time at any given opportunity. It’s best to just leave him be, don’t speak to him, and don’t acknowledge him.”


“What about showers?” I asked, not sure how we could ignore him and still give him the things he had to have.


“He doesn’t get them. We open his flap, and only if he moves to the back of the cell, and a towel and a bar of soap go in. He bird baths or he smells. He has only himself to smell good for anyway.”


“Is he house alone?” I asked, still curious about this strange inmate that had Marshall so spooked.


“He is,” he confirmed, “but that's what happens when you’re responsible for the deaths of two cellmates and an officer.”


“He killed an officer?” I asked, startled since the man I had seen looking through the glass hadn’t looked like much, “Not here, surely, or he would be somewhere else.”


Marshall shook his head, glancing at the cameras before looking out into the shadowy depths of quad two for a second.


“He killed three men in that cell. One when he first got here, another five months later, and an officer five months after that. That's why I’m telling you this. I want you prepared for this man when he comes to talk to you. He is never to be by the door when you open that flap. He is always to be at the back of the cell, facing away from the door, or he gets nothing. He doesn’t eat, he doesn’t get fresh clothes, he doesn’t get anything unless he is facing away from you. Once the things he is required to have are in his cell, you close the flap and walk away. Got it?”


He smiled as he finished and I believed him when he said this wasn’t a joke or some kind of weird hazing. 


I told him I got it, and as the Sergeant walked back in smelling of cigarettes, we went to start showers for the evening. 


That began my time spent around Inmate Bobicus. He was a weird guy, kind of small and quiet for the most part. His parentage was difficult to pin down, he looked mixed race but which races had mixed was anyone's guess, and Marshall just shrugged when I asked him. About once a shift he would try to get my attention, but it was only when Marshall wasn’t around. Marshall was a big guy, probably in his early to mid-forties, who had hands and arms like a longshoreman. Sometimes he would glower at Bobicus, and the inmate would smile and give him this “ain't we old pals?” look. He never spoke to him, and the inmate's food always came in a brown bag so he would drop it in and close it up before the inmate could leave the back of the cell. 


True to his word, Bobicus never showered, never saw medical, never received meds, and never got so much as a letter from anyone. Not because we withheld these things from him, but because no one wanted to have anything to do with him. He was utterly forgotten, a black spot in the dorm, and no one seemed to want to speak with him, inmate or staff. I felt a little bad for him in the beginning, but after night after night of dealing with him, I became less sympathetic.


You see, Inmate Bobicus wanted nothing so much as your attention and he wasn’t picky about how he got it.


Every round he would try some gambit to get you to acknowledge him.


He would try charms, “Hey, sarge, I bet you got somethin tasty in your lunch bag. If you don’t, you can have a soup or somethin. I’ve got a few I’ll,”


He tried to interest you in things you might have in common, “Hey, Sarge, did you catch the game las night? Who won? I remember the Ravens were really gettin they asses kicked in the,”


He would try insults, “Ya, move along, pussy. I didn’t wanna talk to you no ways. I can tell you a weak little shit by the,”


He would claim to need medical assistants, “Officer! Officer! I can’t breathe! I CAN’T BREATHE! I need the nurse! I need to go to the hospital! HELP ME! Someone help,”


Sometimes, he would try to move you by beginning to wail and beg for your help, “Sarge, I need to talk to someone for a minute. I’m thinking dark thoughts and I’m feeling so low. I jus need someone to talk for a,”


But no matter what, we would ignore him and keep doing what we were doing. He never pursued any of this, he never hurt himself, and if you called medical about his “emergencies” they would say he was fine and refuse to come down. Everyone you talked to about Inmate Bobicus seemed to have the same opinion of him, and it was a universal thing that no one liked him or would interact with him. He was an enigma, but he was a mystery I was usually too busy to worry with.


Until they started taking Marshall out of confinement that was.   


It happened at briefing about six months after I started in confinement. We were getting ready to head to our dorms when they informed Marshall that he was working as Security 9 that night. Security 9 is the frontman for the captain, the power behind the throne, and is usually the one who settles issues in the dorms so the captain doesn’t have to. They gave me and Sarge some new guy, Perkins, and I was told to train him up and get him ready for the show. 


Marshall said it would probably just be temporary, and I went to train Perkins so he would be a useful replacement.


Four months later, Perkins had become Forey had become Vets had finally become an officer we’d received from another facility named Adams. 


At that time, Sarge had also been replaced by a useless Sergeant name Belford.


We’d come in one evening to hear that Sarge, Sergeant Thomas, had been hospitalized after a bad heart attack. They weren’t sure he was going to come back, despite his insistence that he needed to return to his post, and Belford had been elected to replace him as our confinement Sergeant. Belford greeted Adams and I, shaking our hands and telling us it was a pleasure to work with us, but he turned out to be useless. Marshall had told me ahead of time, strictly off to the side, that he would be a poor replacement for Sarge, but I didn’t believe him right away. Marshall was a good guy, he’d become my best friend over the last few months, but he could be a bit of a pessimist.


“He’s lazy, unmotivated, and he will not do paperwork or rounds. Worse, when he tries to do paperwork, he messes it up worse than if he just didn’t do it. Adams is lazy too, but at least he can be counted on to finish showers and help with chow. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, buddy, but you are basically the confinement sergeant now. You will hate it, you will likely dream of quitting, but stick it out. In the end, I think your efforts may be rewarded.”


That began the worst three months of my life. 


Belford was every bit as bad as Marshal had warned. Very few of the Co’s on my shift were pictures of health, but Belford made the others look good by comparison. He would not do rounds, he would not deal with inmates unless forced, and when he did he would simply give them what they wanted so he could return to his bubble. What he would do was book inmates into confinement, ruin perfectly good paperwork, and watch Youtube all night as he elevated the stock price of Hot Pockets one box at a time.


After a month, I told him to stop doing folders and that I would do them when I got done with showers. He was happy to oblige and every night after that he happily sprayed crumbs across the keyboard as he consumed carbs and cat videos in equal parts. I sighed in disgust, my pants and shirt sweaty from moving grown men between shower and cell for the first four hours of my shift, and turned back to the folders that were the lifeblood of the unit. Sometimes I would manage to kick the chair Adams was sleeping in hard enough to wake him up for a round, sometimes I would just do it myself, but ultimately the work got done and I persevered.


It was month thirteen for me of my twenty-four-month plan, a plan I suspected I would stretch on for another year because I had given up on rejoining normal society when the mystery of Inmate Bobicus was finally solved.


It was a mystery that would be solved with pain and tears in the end.


Through all of this, inmate Bobicus had not changed at all. He continued to harass every guard who walked past him, but all of them knew better than to interact with him. I had warned all the new ones, but Adams seemed to have nothing for him from the start. He could spit and cuss and kick all he wanted, but he was ignored and he continued to fester in his cell like a mushroom in a shower stall. He still tried, though, and on the day in question, he finally got a reaction from me.


It had been the day from hell.


Two inmates had flooded their cells, making showers take way longer than they should have. Day shift hadn’t finished all the medical visits, so a nurse showed up at ten to get us to pull some inmates. The night shift that had been here the night before that, D shift, had messed up the folders by entrusting them to a new bubble officer, so I spent most of the night fixing that. I had to do incident reports for the two who had flooded since we had to use force on them to get them to stop, and when round time came at four am I still wasn’t halfway through my folders. I looked over to Adams but realized he was gone already. A glance through the windows showed me he was out on the floor with the nurse doing morning med pass, and they were still in Quad Four, where they had started.


I looked at Belford, the big lummox pounding the desk as a cat did something stupid while a person voiced it over, and shook my head as I went to do the round.


I started in one, and that was when it happened.


You see, on top of all of that, Inmate Bobicus had tried to bother me every time I went past his cell all night. He had exhausted all gambits and taken to insulting me more than anything. I was a pussy, I was a cracker, I was a homophobic slur that I won't use here, I performed sex acts with various members of my own species and other species, and on and on and on. I had ground my teeth every time I heard his voice until I was pretty sure my left bottom molar was about to crack, but I’d be lying if I said that was all it was.


Bobicus had been repeating this process every night for as long as I could remember and by now it was like a constant ice flow eroding a stone. My patients, my mental health, and my will to live were in tatters, and I was worried some days that I might hurt him more than I was worried about him hurting me. It’s hard to explain, but after a while the darkness starts creeping up on you and all the hopelessness and negativity turns you into the very thing you hate. No matter how much you fight it, eventually, it gets its claws in you, and that night it got me.


I was coming around his cell when a small voice snapped the minor threads of my sanity like piano wire.


“Sarge, can I talk to you for a minute?”


When his voice hit me, I lost it.


“What, Bobicus?” I shouted, turning my full attention to the cell door for the first time, “What the hell do you want?”


It was dark, but I could see his eyes as he peeked at me through the thin sheet of plexiglass. When he smiled, his teeth looked very white in the dark space, but I was too lost to rage to care. He had wanted my attention? Well, now he had it!


“I just wanted to know what your plans were for after work?”


I opened my mouth to tell him it was none of his damn business what I meant to do, but instead, I told him the truth.


I told him the truth and as the anger drained from me in slow spurts, I felt a sense of intense malaise wash over me.


“I’m going to sleep until it’s time to come to work again. I might stop for some food too.”


“That's good. Man when I was on the outside, I used to love to make weird stuff with gas station food. I’d go buy Ramen noodles and canned cheese and just,”


He just kept talking, kept laying out this recipe for something that sounded terrible, but I couldn’t turn away. I found myself getting closer to the door, stepping right up next to the grate as I listened, and as he went on, I could smell his rancid breath through the little holes. I tried to pull against it, I didn’t want to waste my time with him, but the longer I listened, the more I was drawn in.


“You got any coffee up there, Sarge? I bet you drink it with cream and sugar. My mom and I used to sit on the back porch and drink coffee and watch the sun come up. She was the only person who ever actually talked with me. Everyone else either ignores me or they die, but Mom always seemed to enjoy hearing me talk. I guess she died too, but not cause of nothin I did. She was just old and one day she says, “James, I won't be around forever so you better,”


My teeth chattered a little, my legs shaking as I stood listening to his story. What was happening to me? I felt pulled towards the grate, his words drawing me in, and the longer I listened, the weaker I felt. Someone was saying something over the radio, but anything not coming out of this man's mouth was turned down to background noise. I felt like I might be getting sleepy, like I might be getting ready to pass out, but Bobicus was only getting started. The longer he talked, the more sturdy his voice became. The more I listened, the less weak he sounded and the more he sounded like he was growing. How tall was the man? He hadn’t appeared very large, but the more he spoke, the more it seemed his voice was rising up the door.


“When she died, I just didn’t know what to do with myself, Sarge. I was so sad, and I had to start makin my own way. I was like a child by himself, and all I knew was talkin. I started talkin to people, tellin them my story, and they just kept dyin. At first, it was weird, just watchin them shrivel up the longer they listened, but pretty soon I figured out that it was ME doin it. I was taking something from them, something I had never been able to take before. You see when I was a kid, I was real shy. I only really talked to my mom and clammed up otherwise. I remember once a teacher tried to get me to talk in front of the class but I,”


The words fell from his mouth like diarrhea, and the phrase had never been more apt to me. He was rambling, spewing his words like a firehose, and the longer I listened, the weaker I felt. That was how he killed people, I thought as he kept right on rambling. He talks them to death and steals their life. Pretty soon he’ll do the same to me, I thought, and I tried to break away so I could get out of his vacuum. I pushed with all my might, trying to snap out of my trance, but I was in too deep. I could hear someone yelling, hear inmates kicking and screaming, but I was powerless to do anything but sit there and listen to this fool babble.


When someone hit me in a football tackle, I gasped in pain as my hip impacted the stairs.


I broke my hip in three places, and it likely saved my life.


Marshall had hit me around the waist and when he stood up, he started shouting at the quad for all of them to shut up. He very carefully avoided speaking to Bobicus, but I could see him give Marshall that same knowing grin that he had fixed on him before. Marshall called medical down, and I was loaded onto an ambulance and taken to Cashmere Medical Center. It’s all kind of a blur after the EMT gave me a shot of something, but when I came back to myself, I was in a crisp clean hospital room with Marshall sitting across from me in one of the oversized chairs they always have for guests.


“Good,” he said, breathing a sigh of relief, “I was afraid I was too late.”


“Too late?” I asked, and I almost flinched at how brittle my voice sounded.


“Belford called to tell me that you needed assistants in G! Stat, but the stupid fool didn’t bother to give any details. The story is that you tripped going down the stairs and hurt yourself. The camera footage will likely go missing and the prison will pay for your medical bills and put you on workman's comp.”


I nodded, wincing as my hip throbbed painfully, “Marshall, what the hell happened out there?”


“What happened is that you engaged Inmate Bobicus in conversation and discovered why no one else will. It’s hard to understand if you’ve never seen it in action, but now you know better.”


Marshall flexed his fingers for a moment, trying to find the words to convey what I was really asking, and finally decided to just push ahead with it.


“About a year before you started, I made a similar mistake. I knew better, I had been told better, but Bobicus is crafty. He picks and picks and picks until you just can't take it anymore. That night, he finally got under my skin. I had an inmate in the quad kicking his door and threatening to hurt himself, and the captain we had then made Belford look like a super cop. He refused to come down and deal with it, telling us to handle it, and Bobicus happened to be his neighbor. I had answered him, honestly thinking it was the guy in the cell I’d been dealing with, and before I knew it, he had me. I stood there and listened to his nonsense, feeling my energy get sapped away as he talked. He had me for about three minutes before Sarge noticed what was happening. My fellow floor officer was at the captain's office, he was useless and was out flirting with the girl who did all of the paperwork for my useless captain, and Sarge popped emergency keys and ran out to save me. He dragged me off the floor and pulled me back to the station, but the damage was done.”


Marshall looked at me then, really looked at me, and I saw pain behind his eyes as he asked his next question.


“How old do you think I am?”


I shook my head, “I don’t know. Forty? Forty-three tops?”


He smiled, but there was no joy behind it, “I’ll be twenty-five this year. I’m only three years younger than you. This is what Bobicus does to you. He sucks the life out of you to feed his own sick needs, but not anymore. The Warden says he’s going somewhere special, somewhere he can’t ever do this again. You can rest easy knowing you will be the last, at least I hope so.”


He left after that, saying he had to get some sleep before work tonight.


I look at myself now and understand what Marshall meant. I have aged ten years in a matter of minutes, and I wonder if the change is purely to my appearance. Did he take those years from me? How did he manage to do this with only words? Did the Warden know that this was something he was capable of? It seemed as if he must have, but then why would he give him the opportunity to do it again?


The longer I sit here contemplating it, the more I question what other monsters might lay within Stragview and whether I want to go back there and face them a second time.
