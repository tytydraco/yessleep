I tried to speak up again. That wasn’t a fair answer to my question. “What do you mean st-” Was all I could get out before my mom went off, “Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.” A couple of seconds of silence went by that could’ve gone on forever, my mom’s hands were like stone grasping the dinner table. “Everyone just… eat your food.” My dad said, trying to calm down the situation. Eat my food? I just saw the most horrid thing I’d ever laid my eyes on, and he wants me to eat? I ate anyway. 

I couldn’t have a conversation about what had just happened, and it’s not like I could seek safety in my room after what had just occurred, so I ate. The chicken at that point was cold, and when I went to sleep on the couch that night it sat like a stone in my stomach.

That was a few days ago, ever since then I’ve gotten a knock on my door at exactly 7:59 pm. I also haven’t slept in my bedroom; I’ve only been in there to get clothes or my computer so I could start writing this story.  If you’re reading this, I hope I’m wrong. I hope it’s not a hysteria idea, because that might mean I bring you into the Knocking Man’s game. If that happens, if you hear the knocking, let me know. That being said, if you do hear the knocking, then I would have to stop telling this story just to not spread it any farther. 

Let me update on what’s been happening these past few days.

The next morning, I woke up to my dad shaking my shoulder. “Hey. Wake up, we got to go somewhere.” My eyes groggy, and my mind was blank. It’s only when I see my dad’s face that I remember everything that had happened the night before. “Where are we going?” I asked, not sure if I could really trust anywhere he would take me. “Just trust me. We need to talk.” I awkwardly got up from my makeshift bed and walked to my bedroom. When I got to the door I stopped. Looking at the doorknob, I wonder what could be behind the door. 

It’s at this point I need to tell you why I’m still here, why  I opened up that door and went back into my room, and why I went with my dad where he took me. I, again probably stupidly, still love my family. If you’re confused about what’s happening don’t worry, I’m just as confused as you are. I’m a 17-year-old man, and I’m not able to go anywhere else, even if I could it wouldn’t be right. My family has a problem and so do I. If we’re going to get through it, I need to be able to find some way to get through to them and figure out why I’m the only one that sees anything wrong with it.

It’s a cold morning, and I’m with my dad in his car an hour away from home in a random parking lot to some diner. I wonder why he brought me here until I realize what time it is. 10:50 am, 9 minutes before my dad hears the knock. He stares at the clock unblinkingly, I think of what I could say to break the air, but I know there’s nothing that could make this silence less awkward. We sat there for 9 minutes waiting for the knock, but once 11:00 am read on the clock, we realized it wasn’t going to come. 

My dad let out a sigh of relief, at that point my heart started racing and I realized why we were out here. He was trying to get away. My dad was scared of it too and that’s why we drove an hour away. “It’s Eleven.” I said, “It’s Eleven,” he repeated. “Dad, I’m scared. Why haven’t you talked to me about it?” I could feel tears swelling in my eyes. My dad stared straight ahead, never turning to face me, “I couldn’t. I couldn’t tell you anything. If I did, he-” my dad stopped. “He’d what?” I asked, watching my dad’s face go pale. 

I noticed his eyes had fallen, I followed his glare to the face of the clock on the car’s display. Once again, it read 10:59 am. “Dad?” He says nothing, instead I see his hand reaching for the door, then his window starts to slowly roll down. He turns his head, looking at nothing standing outside of the car. I guess I can’t see the man if it wasn’t my turn, even if I am in on the knocking. After a moment, my dad rolls up the window, turns his head, then starts up the car. As he drives out of the parking lot I hear a slight mumble under his breath, “I’m sorry, son.” Is the only words he said the entire drive. 

It’s been a week since that happened. Ever since then, I’ve been trying to get my dad to open up the same way he did that day.  My dad’s been staying at work later, and my mom went to stay with my grandma a couple of days ago, so it’s mostly been my brother and I at night. Every night at 7:59 pm the man knocks on my bedroom door, I open it, then his sign always reads the same, “Say nothing, go and eat.” At some point it stopped being as frightening as the first night it happened. It, unfortunately, became a normal dinner activity. Last night when I came back to the dinner table, I noticed something had changed. 

When my brother came back to normal and started eating his food, he looked at me and asked, “When’s mom coming home?” The question wasn’t abnormal, it was his eyes. My mom has green eyes, but the rest of our family has blue eyes. When my brother looked at me, his eyes were an obvious green. “Tomorrow.” I stuttered trying to not pay attention to the glaring difference in my brother’s appearance. After we were done eating, my brother went to his room, and I very quickly went to my phone. Scrolling through old pictures I couldn’t find a single one where my brother had blue eyes. It was insane, every single one he had glaring, obvious green eyes. That wasn’t all. In all of the pictures with my dad, he also had green eyes. I know my family, and I’m very sure I’m not crazy. I know my dad and brother have blue eyes. 

When my dad got home from work, I grabbed him and looked into his eyes. They were green! I freaked out, knowing that his eyes have never been green. He told me to calm down, “My eyes haven’t changed, son.” He said. I ran to the bathroom and stared into the mirror. My eyes were still blue, like they had always been.

She brought me out into the living room where my dad and brother were waiting. Sitting in the middle of the room, was a dog that my brother was petting. “This is Wiskey,” my mom said, guiding my hand to pet the dog. I held my hand back for a second, why did they get a dog? We’ve never had a dog, because my dad is allergic. He’s always been opposed to getting a dog, yet now he’s smiling wide at the new pet sitting eerily in the middle of the room. I couldn’t help but ask, “Is this because of The Man?” my mom’s smile briefly faded from her face, before quickly returning, “We got him to help you, sweety.” was all of an answer I’ve gotten since we got the dog. 

I’m sorry this update has taken so long, I’ve needed time to come up with my thoughts on everything, and I’ve been taking care of Wiskey. He’s a very calm dog, at first, he liked being pet, but recently he’s been walking away when anyone tries to pet him. That’s fine considering I’m still slightly weary of the dog that’s going to “Help me,” somehow. It does annoy me how he doesn’t listen to a single thing I say. He won’t sit, or go anywhere I tell him to, and he doesn’t eat when he should. I still make sure his food bowl is full when it needs to be. 

Until last night. We were all sitting eating dinner, when I got up to put food in Wiskey’s bowl. As soon as I picked up the can, I heard the knock at my bedroom door. It’s almost normal to me at this point, something that terrified me so much a couple of weeks ago is now just an annoying knock at the door. I don’t know why, maybe it’s because my family acts like it’s normal, so I feel the need to as well. Maybe it’s because I can’t seem to stop it alone, and if I talked about it outside of the house, it would get worse. 

Knowing I couldn’t ignore the knocks, I went to answer the door. When I answered I saw the same impossible figure I had seen these past few weeks. Tall, skinny man holding a sign. This time, however, the sign was different. “Stop feeding, see what happens.” I slammed the door shut, getting away from the man as fast as I could. I got back to my chair at the table and sat down. I looked to Wiskey, who was sniffing at his empty dog bowl. He never does that. 

Sitting in silence for a few seconds I thought about how insane the idea was. Starve the dog? Why? Why is any of this happening? It’s irritating me, getting under my skin that all of this is just normal to my family, like it isn’t happening, like they aren’t hearing the knocking too, like they aren’t changing! Before I knew it, I was out of my chair and had the can of food in my hand again. As I struggled to open the can, my dad yelled, “What are you doing?” I ignored him and pulled the tab on the can, quickly yanking the metal top off of it. My mom screamed my name. I thought at first she was trying to stop me, but then I realized why she had screamed.

I looked down at my hand. My finger was cut wide open from the can, as blood started rolling out of the side of my hand and pouring onto the floor. My dad ran to get some paper towels, then pressed them against my finger. It sounds gross, but I could feel the cut push open when it was hit by the towel. I had never been cut like that before, so I wasn’t handling it very well, especially coming off of the adrenaline rush I had from defying the Man’s orders. 

I felt like I was freaking out, I looked to my mom and my brother who were still sitting at the table, I looked to my dad who was trying to stop the blood with the towels, then I looked to Wiskey. For the dog that never eats, he was hungry enough that he was licking up my blood that had fallen onto the floor.
