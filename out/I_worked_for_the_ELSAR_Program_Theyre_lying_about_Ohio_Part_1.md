Don’t trust [ELSAR.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/125343t/i_got_an_email_from_a_whistleblower_things_arent/)

If you take nothing else from my post, then spread those words everywhere. Share it, tweet it, paint it on the freaking walls. Someone has to do something, someone has to stop them, before they go too far. I know it sounds like some crazy conspiracy theory, I know most of you won’t believe me, but I swear they’re real.

Real, and dangerous.

My name is Greg Berkitz. They already know who I am, so there’s no point in the whole fake-name thing, is there? Before it all went wrong, I used to work for a little construction company in Tennessee. My wife Sasha and I had an apartment, we were making ends meet, even if just barely, and were trying to have a kid. We both knew it would make our lives ten times more hectic, but we didn’t care. Some people might think that’s stupid, but when you’re with the person you love, your perspective changes. I wanted to be a dad, in the worst way, and every time I saw Sasha paging through a pregnancy book, or shopping for baby clothes online, it made us both giggle like excited school children.

One day, our boss called the entire crew together, and handed out pamphlets detailing an offer made by some oddball group called the Black Crow Foundation. With all the industrial ‘accidents’ that had been happening around the country lately, the foundation wanted to help keep America’s waterways and air pollution-free, but they needed manpower, especially men who knew their way around power tools. For such help, the massive non-profit would pay each man $250,000 for one month of work at various chemical cleanup sites around the country, with all personal protective equipment provided for us.

You read that right. A quarter of a million bucks, *post-tax* for just thirty days of work.

Our boss checked the group out thoroughly, called government registration offices, even met with their attorney, all to ensure it wasn’t some elaborate scam. Even the Army sent out a high-ranking officer to vouch for them. In the end, the boss man told us with the biggest grin I’d ever seen him wear that the BCF was real and gave us the green light to sign up.

Everyone did.

Including me.

After all, for that much money, who wouldn’t? Besides, Sasha and I were getting by, but as soon as she got pregnant, I knew I’d need a lot more money to keep my family warm and fed. Call me what you will, but I love my wife, and I wanted to give her everything.

I would have gone even if they only offered $50,000.

Sasha was naturally both thrilled, and skeptical when I broke the news to her. For a price so steep, she reasoned there had to be a catch, but we both knew to throw such an opportunity aside on suspicion alone was ludicrous. We might never get this kind of chance again. So, I bid her an emotional goodbye, packed my backs, and got on a bus provided by the foundation, bound for my pre-selected work site.

Several days later, I found myself slogging through the forests of southern Ohio, tired and missing home, while the overcast sky wept curtains of continuous rain.

My rubber boot slid on the mud, and I tripped.

“Careful.” Thirty-Six caught me under my right arm and kept me from falling on my face. “You don’t want to rip your suit.”

*You mean no one wants to see me end up like Seven.*

Raindrops pattered down on the yellow plastic hood over my head, each tom-tom of liquid rhythm a stark reminder of just what a torn suit could entail.

“Twenty-Four, are you alright?” The sharp voice of R-Eleven barked from the front of the column. His olive-colored rubber overalls matched the gloomy surroundings of the Appalachian foothills, and the skeletal trees dripped cold rain onto us both with indifference.

I eyed the shiny black rifle in his gloved hands and straightened up. “I’m fine. I just slipped.”

R-Eleven stepped closer to me, and his wary gaze searched my burden from behind his gas mask. “Equipment check.”

The rest of the column froze, all eyes on me, Thirty-Six, and R-Eleven. The other guards shifted on their feet in uncomfortable stamps, stroked their rifles with nervous thumbs and scanned the trees. My fellow workers in their yellow suits stood motionless, all waiting to see if I had made some dreaded mistake, one that would spell my immediate removal.

*Why do they all have to stare like that?*

Doing my best not to sigh in annoyance and embarrassment, I unshouldered my bulky pack, and balanced it on one knee. “All in order, sir. Nothing’s broken.”

R-Eleven glared hard at me, and his narrowed eyes traveled the length of my suit with meticulous scrutiny.

No one moved, and aside from the pattering rain, not a sound could be heard.

A few yards away, R-Sixteen, one of the other guards, flexed his grip on his rifle, and took a step my way.

*Please God, I didn’t do anything wrong. My suit isn’t ripped, I feel fine, I didn’t drop anything . . .*

“Clear.” R-Eleven let his shoulders slacken and took one hand off his rifle to give me an encouraging clap on the arm. “Hang in there, and watch your step, alright? It’s not much further.”

With that, Thirty-Six helped me pull my pack over my shoulders again, and the column shuffled onward.

Grateful to be out from under the hawkish watch of the guards, I put my mind to breathing under my tight-fitted respirator and tried not to think about Seven. With the dull gray sky above empty of any birds, and no wind to speak of, the squelching of boots in the mud, muffled breathing under protective masks, and the creak of rucksack straps echoed like cannon shots. I couldn’t smell anything other than the chlorine sting of my rubber mask. My dry throat cried out for water, but I knew we wouldn’t be allowed to drink anything until we reached the site.

Thirty-Six hefted his pack higher on his broad shoulders ahead of me, and I took a moment to study him. As with all the others, I didn’t know his name, and he didn’t know mine. All we had to go by were numbers given to us at random the first day we’d showed up. That had been by design, and as far as I knew, even the guards with their green suits, black guns, and the ominous “R” before their code numbers didn’t know one another’s names. None of the guys from my old job in Tennessee were at this site, and I had a feeling that this too was deliberate. Yet of all the workers so far, Thirty-Six seemed to be the only one who wasn’t spooked by the bizarre secrecy of the operation.

He reminded me of my father, at least twice my age and a head taller, with silver hair and a warm smile that didn’t reflect the suspicion the rest of the crew emanated. In fact, Thirty-Six seemed to be the one person in the entire operation who never drew any attention, no matter what he did. When he’d somehow found out about my birthday on the second day at base camp, Thirty-Six had miraculously produced an old-style Hershey bar as an impromptu gift. Even the strait-laced Colonel had been too shocked at seeing me with retro candy to yell about it, though he’d doubled the guard around camp afterward.

*If they would just let someone go into town for better food, chocolate wouldn’t be so rare. I mean seriously, they’re paying us a stupid amount just to be here, does the Colonel really think we’d run off? The only guy I know of without a number, and he’s got an enormous stick shoved up his—*

“We’re here.”

I almost ran into Thirty-Six and my heart did a nervous flip-flop a halt at his words.

The rest of the column filed into the edge of the clearing behind me, and one by one ground to a standstill, the squelch of boots dying to a solemn silence.

Glad for the reprieve and curious, I shuffled aside to peer around Thirty-Six into the work site for the first time.

*Whoa.*

It sat nestled between a grove of pines like a great sleeping dragon of steel, with the prow jutting out over a defilade, and the stern hunched against several limestone boulders. The massive propellers hung a good fifteen feet above the ground, and the radio antennas rose high into the slate gray sky above the dense trees in rigid lines. All around, the green pines stood bent or broken from the weight of the thing coming down on them, and ripples in the bulky steel hull showed where the craft’s algae-lined skin had slammed into the ground.

I blinked hard, and took a step forward, almost unable to believe my own eyes.

*Is . . . is that a battleship?*

“Eyes on me.” A cold, familiar voice cut through the tension, and the others broke their wide-eyed stares to find the Colonel perched on the hood of a nearby army truck, dressed in his own olive drab protective suit.

From where I stood, I couldn’t see the Colonel’s eyes behind his plastic gas mask visor, but the stern caution in his voice, the way he didn’t completely turn to face us as if afraid to take his eyes off the warship, made ice run through my blood.

“This is the work site. You will work here from 0600 to 1800 hours every day. You will stay in your assigned work teams and report any new findings directly to the guard force. Under *no* circumstances are you to take anything from this area for personal use. Such actions will result in immediate removal. Am I understood?”

Seven’s manic scream filtered through my memory, along with the echo of the gunshot that ended it.

I nodded, along with everyone else.

“Good.” The Colonel waved his gloved hand at the land-locked vessel, and I could have sworn I caught his voice tremble ever so slightly. “Our guard forces have already swept both the ship and the surrounding area for security threats. Your job is to take radiological and magnetic readings, as well as gather all loose items inside the ship for collection. Scanning teams will move in first, then the evidence teams. All recovered items will be bagged and placed in secured containers before being loaded onto the trucks here.”

He pointed to the row of waiting diesel trucks, against whom leaned several more soldiers in green chemical suits, all carrying rifles.

“Any questions?”

*You mean like how did a battleship end up in middle-of-nowhere Ohio?*

Still, I didn’t raise my hand, and no one else did either. Something about this rubbed me wrong, the air tasted metallic through my mask, and a cold sensation rippled down my spine like water over the bones. It occurred to me that ever since arriving at the base camp a few miles away, I had yet to see a bird or any other kind of animal in this general vicinity. The lack of noise had been unsettling then, but now, it made my stomach churn.

I risked a glance over my shoulder at the way we’d come.

My gaze met R-Sixteen’s and he, along with the rest of the guard force, stared back from their line drawn across the trail, weapons at low ready.

Sweat started to roll down my armpits, and I tried to breathe slow to calm my panic.

*They’re just securing the perimeter, that’s all. The Colonel said we get to leave at 1800. They’re just here for our protection.*

“Relax.” Thirty-Six’s muffled whisper startled me from my frantic thoughts. “They don’t want to shoot anyone. They’re as nervous as you are.”

Gripping the straps of my pack, I swallowed a sour-tasting lump in my throat, glad he couldn’t see my doubtful wince behind my respirator. “If you say so.”

Ahead, the Colonel checked his watch, and threw another murky look toward the looming battleship. “Right, if there aren’t any questions . . . team leaders, take charge of your units, and get to work.”

Like trained yellow automatons, Thirty-Six, myself, and the rest of the workers unshouldered our heavy packs and began to ready various pieces of equipment. Some had hammers, drills, handheld gas torches, and battery powered saws. Others, like my team, had Geiger counters, electromagnetic detectors, and enough cameras to fit out a library in North Korea. Up until now, the exact details of our job had been kept a secret by the higher-ups, who gave us vague replies whenever we asked. Even though it made more sense as the seconds ticked by, I didn’t feel any better about it.

I picked up some sort of hand-held meter, and noticed a few words stenciled on the side in faded, smeared black letters, as if someone had tried to scrub them off, but failed.

*Property of the Environmental Liminal Space Alleviation and Reduction Program.*

My brow furrowed. *ELSAR*? I’d thought we were working for the Black Crow Foundation. Perhaps this was some sort of hand-me-down piece of gear donated by someone else?

“Nine and I will take the readings. Twenty-Four, you and Fifteen will record.” My team leader, Eleven, adjusted the black nylon strap on his side-slung Geiger counter, and broke me from my train of thought.

Thirty-Six said nothing, silent and content with his large flashlight. Our team was the only one with five members, and for some reason, Eleven never remembered Thirty-Six in any of his checks or briefings. It always bothered me, but not enough to say anything, since Thirty-Six never seemed to mind. I wasn’t that close with the team anyway, Thirty-Six being my only friend in camp. In fact, I had seen the others so infrequently, that in this moment, I couldn’t quite recall what they looked like without their suits on.

“How are we getting in?” Fifteen visibly shook, and his gloved hands almost dropped the camera he held twice.

Eleven jerked his head at another team that lugged a large roll of rope netting toward the ship. “I figure we’ll climb the side. No way we’re cutting through all that armor, not without bigger cutting torches.”

To my left, Nine swiveled his hooded head to examine our tiny group. “So, we’re just not going to talk about that fact that there is a literal battleship in the middle of the woods?”

His voice rang out louder than he likely intended, and all but Thirty-Six froze.

Eleven, Fifteen, and I all glared at Nine, our eyes darting toward the nearby guards.

None looked our way, but still, my skin crawled.

*That was way too close.*

As if he thought the same thing, Nine let his shoulders slump in a sheepish, uncomfortable apology.

“Later.” Eleven hissed behind his respirator and rolled his deflated rucksack up in a tarp to keep the rain from soaking it further. The rest of us followed suit, and with our gear shouldered, we headed for the beached steel warship.

In a broad line, our team moved along with the other scanners, and swept the ground with our detection equipment for any signs of abnormality. I carried a small notepad on a clipboard, a camera mounted on my left shoulder in a special nylon harness. Fifteen recorded Nine’s electromagnetic readings, and I took down the radiation levels from Eleven. Thirty-Six walked along beside me with his oversized flashlight and said nothing.

“Point six . . . point three . . . point five . . .” Eleven droned on, his voice almost as automated as the clicking counter in his gloved hands.

*Nominal, nominal, nominal.*

I scratched the numbers down with my pen and tried not to look up at the ship that loomed ever closer. Per our brief instruction on the equipment, radiation levels were normal, for the most part. Nine couldn’t find anything remotely strange about the electromagnetic fields in this area. Yet in my mind’s eye, I could see Seven’s contorted face, hear his inane screams, and I shivered.

All around, the scattered branches from the trees that the ship had crushed poked into the sky like skeletal fingers, as if silently trying to warn us away. An icy sensation ran down my back, and I imagined them reaching for me, their silent screams a strange static that rang in my head. It escalated into a roar so that my ears itched, and the breath stuck inside my windpipe like it had been glued there. For a split second, the noise crashed in waves against the inside of my skull, along with a low monotone beeping.

*Almost like a rhythm . . . or a pattern.*

Something grabbed my shoulder, and I almost jumped out of my skin in fright.

Thirty-Six met my frightened gaze and pointed with his flashlight ahead of me. “Stay focused. You have to climb now.”

The massive iron ship squatted not yards away, its thick rivets coated in fresh surface rust, pine needles stuck to its smooth sides, the red paint from beneath the waterline chipped and peeling. All the scanning teams stood in line at the side of the ship and gaped up at it, though with their masks on, I couldn’t see their slack jaws. In somber reflex, the first team busily prepared two pneumatic launchers to fire grappling hooks over the tall gunwales.

One of the other scanners, Three, slogged through the muck to Eleven. “We’re taking the bridge, and teams two and three are on the upper decks. I need you guys to go with teams five and six to the lower levels and sweep them out. Okay?”

Eleven threw a sideways glance at the battleship, and then back at the line of green-clad soldiers far to our rear. “They checked it, right?”

Three’s eyes held the same cynical resignation behind his protective mask as Eleven’s. “They did. But I don’t think we’d be wearing this garbage if it was completely safe. So, stay on your toes, alright? Radio me if anything goes wrong.”

“Like that would help.” Nine muttered, and I snorted in agreement beneath my own mask.

*Chunk, chunk.*

Both pneumatic grapples shot into the air and landed with resounding clangs on the deck of the old warship. As soon as their metal hooks snagged the ship’s railing, the advance team unfurled a long brown cargo net, and hauled it up the slippery steel by the ropes. It reminded me of the old photographs I’d seen in my school days, black and white visages of men clambering over the sides of these mighty iron titans, loaded down with weapons and gear, to charge into the unknown surf of war. How strange was it that we, similarly loaded down with gear and apprehension, now strove to surmount those same nets and rails, to discern why this vessel existed here at all?

“Alright, let’s move.” Three called from the foot of the cargo net, doing his best to shout in a full-face respirator. “Hands on the verticals, feet on the horizontals. Three points of contact at all times. And for God’s sakes, *don’t look down*.”

My heart leapt into my throat, but I swallowed hard, and sloshed through the rain after the others toward the net. I had never been very good at climbing in gym class, and the rope would be soaked with the incessant rain by the time my turn came. A fall from that height would mean broken bones at minimum, and who knew what contaminants lay undiscovered on the ground?

*All it took for Seven was falling asleep with his headphones on, four miles away. We don’t even know what we’re dealing with, do we? No one does.*

The promised $250,000 payment for this job struck me as pitiful now that I stood at the threshold of whatever monstrosity the authorities had stumbled upon in this desolate stretch of Ohio’s wilderness. I thought of Sasha, and our jubilant plans for when I returned home. I’d been so proud to be able to provide that much for us, after two years of scraping by, paycheck-to-paycheck. If she only knew where I stood now, I doubted my darling wife would even want the money anymore.

Eleven and Fifteen scaled the net, followed by Nine and myself. Thirty-Six climbed right next to me, as calm and cool as if this were an everyday occurrence for him. I shook like a leaf, my heart rammed itself against my chest, and the muddy soles of my rubber over-boots slid on the net with cruel ease.

“Almost there.” Thirty-Six grunted from his place on the netting. “You’re doing fine.”

“Mmm hmm.” I wanted to sound carefree, but my hands trembled so hard that I felt like I stood on a giant oily washing machine.

My palm missed the next handhold, and everything went into slow motion.

Around me, the entire world jerked downwards, and my extended right boot missed its mark thanks to my backward tumble.

In a panic, I squeezed my eyes shut, my lungs closing in terror.

A quick, strong weight crushed the air from my chest, and I stopped so hard my teeth clacked together.

“Dude, you okay?”

I opened my eyes to find Fifteen and Thirty-Six each had a hand on my nylon camera harness, their quick thinking the only thing between me and a sixty-foot fall.

Scrabbling for the net, I didn’t breathe until I had all four limbs safely back on the thick webbing. “Y-yeah. Thanks guys.”

Fifteen cocked his head to one side, his voice confused. “Um . . . okay. Good thing you’re lighter than you look.”

Thirty-Six chuckled and waited for me to crawl up beside him again. “Come on, it’ll be drier inside.”

*I don’t care if it’s soaked, as long as I can’t fall, I’ll take it.*

Once my legs swung over the steel rail of the ship, and my feet hit the deck, I let out a long sigh of relief.

“There he is.” Nine slapped me on the back, his tone warm and teasing. “Almost lost you. Good thing Fifteen is dummy-strong.”

“Or just strong.” Fifteen shook his head at Nine, but I could tell the praise pleased him. “Seriously though Twenty-Four, don’t do that again.”

“Sure thing.” I gave him a thumb’s up, though my knees knocked beneath my suit.

Eleven waved us over, his Geiger counter in hand, and his green eyes betrayed a concern that made me forget about my near-death tumble. “Nine, get your scanner out.”

Nine unbuckled his bulky electromagnetic scanner from its place on his harness and pointed it over the ship.

For the first time in the brief period we’d worked together, Nine seemed speechless.

“So, you’re seeing it too?” Eleven kept his voice low, and all around the deck, I noticed the other teams clotted together, talking in hushed, concerned whispers. “There’s no way the rain did this, these are waterproof. It has to be the ship.”

“What is it?” Fifteen stuck his head over Eleven’s shoulder, too curious to be afraid.

Eleven held up his device, and my guts soured.

Nine’s electromagnetic scanner was having what amounted to a mechanical seizure, where in one second it flew off the charts on high readings, and the next, it dropped down to nothing at all. Eleven’s Geiger counter on the other hand showed radioactive detection, but not in a consistent pattern. It didn’t spike randomly like Nine’s readings, but pulsed in a rhythmic, almost synchronized beat, like an irradiated heart monitor.

Fifteen and I stood frozen, too stunned to record the rapid-fire measurements.

Eleven tapped the side of his counter with frustrated knuckles but couldn’t get it to stabilize. “I’ll let Three know, and he’ll radio back to the Colonel. Maybe he’ll pull us out. Sit tight guys.”

The instant Eleven walked away, Nine turned to us, and cast a few furtive looks around the deck. “Something isn’t right. I was told this would be a chemical cleanup job, not some naval version of Chernobyl. And how on earth did they get this thing way out here anyway?”

“They couldn’t have.” Fifteen crossed both arms in his typical discomfort at anything that resembled a threat to normalcy. “It has to have been an accident. Maybe there was a flood or something?”

Nine set both hands on his hips in indignation. “A flood? Look around man, we’re miles from the nearest major river, and at least two states away from the ocean. It didn’t float here. Besides, did you see how those guards acted? They don’t even want to get close to this thing.”

I leaned back over the railing, and from my high place atop this strange vessel, the line of soldiers in the distant tree line looked like little olive-drab ants. “Maybe they don’t know either. After all, if they knew, why hire us? Why pay money for something they could do themselves?”

“So where did this hunk of junk come from then?”

Nine’s question remained unanswered, as Eleven strode back into our circle, his fists balled.

He beckoned the four of us closer, and spat between angry, gritted teeth. “Three wants to pull out, but the Colonel said no. I guess radiation isn’t at lethal levels, so he wants us to finish our scans and help the evidence teams start cleanup. So, here’s what we’re gonna do; we go down, and get our scans done quick as possible. Once we’re finished, we radio Three, and head for the ground again, where it’s safe. If the Colonel wants, he can come help us shovel radioactive bolts for all I care. But I’m not getting cancer forty years too soon while *he* sits on his tail in a nice dry tent. Got it?”

I nodded along with the others, both emboldened, and unsettled at Eleven’s defiance. I didn’t want to risk sterility via irradiation, but I still remembered how the Colonel had dispatched Seven without so much as blinking an eye. Suppose he ordered us back on the boat at gunpoint? None of us had any guns, and even if we did, there were far more soldiers than workers. Sasha and I couldn’t have children if I got shot.

Three led his team to the bridge, and I trailed behind Eleven, awed at the sheer size of this ship. It seemed to be a huge island of metal, and I wracked my brain to try and remember how long my grandfather’s minesweeper had been during his service in the Korean War.

“It’s an Iowa class.” Thirty-Six strode behind me as we went down a long set of iron stairs into the lower decks of the ship. “One of the biggest battleships America ever built. They say the guns were so powerful, that a full broadside with all four turrets would crater the surface of the ocean and expose the hull right down to the keel.”

I clicked on the headlamp built into my hood and swept its bright white beam over the bulkheads of the vessel. “Wow. I wonder what this one was called?”

“Seraphim.” Nine waved back from the dark corridor at the foot of the stairs and tapped his gloved hand on a circular life preserver on the wall. “USS Seraphim.”

My brow furrowed, and I clanked down the rest of the metal stairs in silence. History had been a side hobby of mine for years, but I’d never heard of the USS Seraphim, not in any books or documentaries. Granted, I was no professor, but with such a big ship, I figured I would have heard of it somewhere.

*Especially from Grandpa. He knew tons of ships, and this thing should’ve been around for the Korean War. Hmm, weird.*

Down two flights of narrow steps we went, through oval-shaped metal bulkhead doors and claustrophobic shadowy corridors. In the dark interior of the battleship, our headlamps illuminated clean hallways, fresh paint on the steel, and even scuff marks on the floor from shoe polish rubbed off boots. Blue tin cups sat on desks, still brimming with coffee that had gone cold, and paper manuals lay open at antiquated control posts. It seemed as if the sailors of the USS Seraphim had left the ship only days ago, everything frozen in time.

“Did the soldiers clear out the bodies?” Nine’s voice echoed in the dark expanse of a third deck passageway, his scanner still spasming, Eleven’s Geiger counter thumping away at every step. “Or am I somehow missing the corpses of thousands of sailors?”

Eleven too acted uninterested in his counter now that we were deep inside the ship, and peered into the various small compartments we passed by with caution, only to find abandoned workstations, empty bunks, and ancient equipment of war. “I doubt it. They’re having us do all the heavy lifting. Besides, you see any blood? There’s not even a scrap of loose clothing.”

“Maybe it’s a trick?” Fifteen glanced behind us, and his dark eyes darted back and forth in paranoia. “They could be testing some kind of secret weapon on us or something. My cousin lives an hour away from here, he’s been hearing some crazy stuff coming from [Barron County.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12byki4/im_an_oilfield_worker_in_barron_county_ohio_were/) Maybe the government is pretending to be a non-profit for some kind of experiment?”

“Or,” Nine poked his head into a room, and searched the abandoned space with his light. “Someone else put this thing here to draw us in. Like a mousetrap with cheese.”

“Who, aliens?” Fifteen tried to sound incredulous, but his gloved hands shook with their clipboard and pen, his headlamp wavering as well.

Nine shrugged, and kicked at a stray pebble from Eleven’s muddy boots. “I don’t know. You remember Seven’s meltdown? He was screaming about a [long dark road,](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116md9g/stay_away_from_tauerpin_road_part_1/) falling from the sky, and voices. I’m telling you, this thing didn’t get here on its own. It was put here on purpose.”

“It doesn’t matter how it got here.” Eleven checked his Geiger counter, but from the way his shoulders hitched in anxiety, I wondered if he didn’t secretly agree with one of their theories, or both. “The sooner we get this over with, the sooner we can leave. As long as no one gets hurt, I don’t care if the aliens and the government have a top-secret orgy in this irradiated rust bucket.”

With that, Eleven moved off down the central corridor, followed by Nine, and an uneasy Fifteen.

Chafing at being left in the rear yet again, I picked up my boot to step through the next bulkhead after them.

*Beep*.

I whirled around and stared off into another dark corridor on my left.

*Beep-beep, beep, beep-beep.*

My nerves tingled, and I realized that it wasn’t from Eleven’s counter, nor Nine’s scanner. None of us had cellphones, thanks to the Colonel confiscating them after Seven’s demise. Nothing we had with us could have made that sound.

*Shhhhh . . . beep-beep, beep.*

Garbled radio static, followed by more monotone beeps echoed faintly from somewhere deep inside the darkness, and sent chills running down my spine. The ship’s lights and power weren’t on, and without the massive oil-fired engines producing current, nothing mechanical in this iron behemoth should have worked.

*Am I hearing things? Should I say something? What if the others think I’m going crazy, like Seven?*

“It’s close by.” Thirty-Six walked up beside me, and the beam of his extra-large flashlight probed the blackness of the unexplored hallway like a white laser. “Come on.”

I opened my mouth to protest but stopped myself. Thirty-Six had never steered me wrong and saved my life at least once today. Besides, we were supposed to report any strange activity to Three, and this counted as strange in my book. Maybe if I was the first one to report something unusual, the Colonel would give me a bonus, or at least, a phone call home to Sasha.

*With how close it sounds, we can check it out, and catch up with the others before they even notice we’re gone.*

Taking a deep breath, I cast one last cautious glance at the others, and pursued Thirty-Six down the side hall.
