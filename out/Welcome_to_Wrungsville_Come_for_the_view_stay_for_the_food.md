I left Wrungsville when I got married.

I was eighteen at the time—way too young and dumb to make a decision of that significance, but I have never regretted putting that place behind me. Alas, I could've chosen a better runaway partner, but in fairness, I did mention that I was afflicted with being dumb as a bag of rocks.

Brent, my high school sweetheart at the time, was raring to go after what happened to his sister, and I was sick and tired of the air, the incidents, the curfews.

Brent and I had a good couple of years, some okay years, and then some not-so-okay years. I could handle the bills, the shit pay, the dingy apartments, and even the affairs—but I couldn't handle the drinking and the beatings. Whiskey was his favorite mistress.

He never truly got over it. We made it out of Wrungsville, but what happened to Andrea hung over him like a dark veil of misery stapled to his side at all times. The drinking dulled the pain somewhat, so I still can't bring myself to blame him or hate him completely.

She was only 12 years old when it happened.

But, for the sake of our two children, I had to leave yet another dangerous place and got a divorce. It was messy, but I managed full custody. I turned my life around, got a good-paying job, a nice roof over our heads, and I could call myself "content" for the first time in... well, for the first time.

All that changed when I got the call from my mother, urging me to come back home. My brother had died. They labeled it a "hunting accident," but everyone knows what that really means down at the ’ville.

So, against my better judgment, I loaded the kids into my old Toyota and got on the road heading "home."

Six hours flew by, despite the occasional hissy fits and my fruits of the womb's supernatural ability to get under each other's skins. I was too deep into my own thoughts and memories to really care about the constant bickering.

"Mooooooom, Eric won't stop kicking my chair," whined Samantha, my oldest, from the passenger seat.

"SHUT UP. If you don't wanna get kicked, move your stupid seat," snapped back Eric from the back seat. "I am stuck here with the bags and you keep reclining and I can't stretch my legs."

"Ugh, you're a little worm. It's not like you need that much space," replied Samantha with a little evil smirk, knowing she was pressing a sensitive subject—leaving me no room but to intervene.

"Both of you, behave!" I yelled. "Sam, don't make fun of your brother and move your goddamn seat forward. Eric, stop kicking your sister! We both know that if it wasn't the seat, you'd find something else to kick her over."

Both of them grumbled in annoyed agreement. Samantha moved her seat forward about an eighth of the diameter of a single strand of hair. Small victories. Gotta take those when you can.

"Why do we even have to go to this thing, Mom?" Eric asked. "It's not like we knew Uncle Kevin."

"Well, you didn't know him, kiddo... but I did. And Grandma asked me to come," I replied. "Trust me, I would've dropped you two with someone and spared you the misery of the trip, but no one was available and the kennels were all full for the weekend."

I shot a smirk at him and he smiled. Samantha rolled her eyes. It was becoming a growing trend in our house.

She might not believe me, but I was her age once. Also filled to the brim with the edgy adolescence that makes annoyance the automatic response to everything. Though, even back then, me and my brother Kevin were very close.

Mom and Dad usually worked late down at the store, and he was the one that regularly made sure I got home okay and before nightfall. I might've bickered, but I never resented him for it. Besides him being my big brother and me loving him, my room faced the woods.

I had heard the incessant crying. The price to pay.

We were getting closer to town, already on the descent. Driving down the top of the hill I could see Wrungsville from above. It was a pretty sight. Wrungsville was an affluent place, well taken care of, definitely picturesque. Sprawling gardens adorned with fancy-looking fountains and marble statues. Pearly white buildings as far as the eye can see.

A picture of the ’ville wouldn't look out of place as the backdrop to one of those propaganda pieces from the ’50s depicting the "American Dream."

As we made our way down, we were suddenly surrounded by the trees. A growing feeling had begun in my stomach ever since we passed the sign indicating that we were in the outskirts of town. It had crept up, inflating like a balloon as we made our descent.

Now it was on my chest, restricting my lungs, making it difficult to get a breath in and out.

Images of my brother came to me. His warm smile. His tight embrace every time I safely made it back home. Flashes of those nights I crept into his room, crying more often than not because the sounds outside made it hard to fall asleep.

I tried not to let my imagination run loose, but I couldn't help but think of his final moments. My mother refused to tell me any details.

I keep picturing him by himself, the trees closing in, all alone.

Until he wasn't.

The morbid picture show I had conjured in my head came to a sudden stop when I realized Samantha had rolled down her window all the way. Her arm was out of the car, making waves in the air.

My heart sank into my stomach.

"Samantha, honey, please roll your window up. You can turn on the A/C," I tried, attempting not to let the panic reach my voice.

"What? Ugh, Mom, no," she started. "There's freaking fresh air outside."

I couldn't keep it bottled any longer.

"Baby, please—please—don't do this. Close the window, keep your arms inside," I shrieked, hearing something shift somewhere deep in the trees. Branches shattering. Leaves rustling violently.

"Mom, what the hell, look at the road. I'm just cooling myself off."

I started braking while attempting to plea, desperately—but only a series of wheezy noises escaped my progressively tightening ribcage.

"Mom?" A small voice rose from the back. It was Eric. He was staring out his window. I only caught it for a split second, but he seemed confused.

And scared.

That's when I heard my daughter scream.

**Something had caught her arm.**

I stepped hard on the brake as I felt something wet hit my face in a jet. It was coming from the passenger window. Wrapped around my daughter's arm I saw rows of putrid, brown-tinged teeth. I saw how the pale, white flesh contorted under the tension of the vice around it, the lines of tension giving way to highways of torn shreds, pulsating and gurgling in a violent spew of my own flesh and blood.

The car came to a violent stop, knocking my head against the windshield. My senses returned just in time to hear shouting.

Panic had filled the car. I felt a warm river overflowing on my scalp, the blood making it hard to see out of my left eye.

"MOM MOM OH GOD MOM, SAM'S OUT OF THE CAR!"

The shouting was coming from Eric. He was shrieking, banging his hands desperately on the glass.

I turned my head toward the passenger seat.

**Empty.**

Where my daughter had sat, there was only a pool of gore.

Looking out of the passenger window I saw it. A sack of lumpy meat in a vaguely humanoid drape of skin sat on the ground. Its back was facing me, but I could see its bald head bobbing reverently.

Its body was too thin. Irregularly placed patches of dirty, wire-thin hair covered its body and gangly limbs, crooked at the joints.

The bobbing stopped. Its meal interrupted by my son's bloody shrieks.

It turned rapidly.

Its mouth was a mess of sagging skin hiding an abyss of crooked razorblades. I saw her hair—her pretty blonde hair—caught in between them.

I wanted to cry out in horror, I wanted to yell, I wanted to get out of the car and do... something.

I couldn't.

And the reason was that the beast's black, beady eyes weren't aimed at me.

**They were fixed on Eric.**

I put the car in drive and I floored it. I did not look at the rearview mirror. I did not listen to Eric's shouts and pleas to turn the car around as they morphed into wails of gut-wrenching grief.

I focused on not veering off the road as I stepped on the pedal, only breaking focus slightly to roll the passenger window up.
