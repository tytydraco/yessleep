I left Wrungsville when I got married. I was eighteen at the time - way too young and dumb to make a decision of that significance - but I’ve never regretted putting that place behind me. 

 

Alas, I could've chosen a better runaway partner, but in fairness, I did mention that I was afflicted with being dumb as a bag of rocks. 

 

Brent, my high school sweetheart, was raring to go after what happened to his sister, and I was sick and tired of the air, the incidents, the curfews. 

  
Brent and I had a good couple of years, some okay years, and then some not-so-okay years. I could handle the bills, the shit pay, the dingy apartments, and even the affairs - but I couldn't handle the drinking and the beatings.

  
Whiskey was his favorite mistress. He never truly got over it.

  
We made it out of Wrungsville, but what happened to Andrea hung over him like a dark veil of misery stapled to his side at all times. The drinking dulled the pain somewhat, so I still can't bring myself to blame him or hate him completely. She was only twelve years old when it happened.

  
But for the sake of our two children, I had to leave yet another dangerous place. I got a divorce. A messy one, but I managed full custody.

  
I turned my life around - got a good-paying job, a nice roof over our heads - and I could call myself “content” for the first time in… well, for the first time.

  
All that changed when I got the call from my mother, urging me to come back home. My brother had died. They labeled it a "hunting accident", but everyone knows what that really means down at the 'ville.

  
So, against my better judgment, I loaded the kids into my old Toyota and got on the road, heading "home."

 

Six hours flew by, despite the occasional hissy fits and my fruits of the womb’s supernatural ability to get under each other’s skin. I was too deep in my own thoughts and memories to really care about the constant bickering. 

 

"Mooooooom, Eric won't stop kicking my chair," whined Samantha, my oldest, from the passenger seat. 

  
"SHUT UP. If you don't wanna get kicked, move your stupid seat," snapped Eric from the back seat. "I'm stuck here with the bags and you keep reclining, and I can't stretch my legs."

  
"Ugh, you're a little worm. It’s not like you need that much space," replied Samantha, with a little evil smirk - knowing she was pressing a sensitive subject, leaving me no choice but to intervene.

  
"Both of you, behave!" I yelled. "Sam, don’t make fun of your brother and move your goddamn seat forward. Eric, stop kicking your sister! We both know that if it wasn't the seat, you'd find something else to kick her over."

  
Both of them grumbled in annoyed agreement. Samantha moved her seat forward about an eighth of the diameter of a single strand of hair.

  
Small victories - you gotta take those when you can.

 

"Why do we even have to go to this thing, Mom?" Eric asked. "It's not like we knew Uncle Kevin." 

  
"Well, you didn’t know him, kiddo... but I did. And Grandma asked me to come" I replied. "Trust me, I would've dropped you two with someone and spared you the misery of the trip, but no one was available and the kennels were all full for the weekend." I shot a smirk at him, and he smiled. Samantha rolled her eyes. It was becoming a growing trend in our house.

  
She might not believe me, but I was her age once - also filled to the brim with that edgy adolescence that makes annoyance the automatic response to everything.

  
Though, even back then, Kevin and I were very close.

  
Mom and Dad usually worked late down at the store, and he was the one who regularly made sure I got home okay and before nightfall.

  
I might’ve bickered, but I never resented him for it. Besides him being my big brother and me loving him, my room faced the woods.

  
I had heard the incessant crying.

  
The price to pay.

 

We were getting closer to town, already on the descent. Driving down the top of the hill, I could see Wrungsville from above. 

  
It was a pretty sight - an affluent place, well taken care of, definitely picturesque. Sprawling gardens with fancy-looking fountains. Pearly white buildings as far as the eye could see.  
A picture of the 'ville wouldn’t look out of place as the backdrop to one of those propaganda pieces from the 1950s depicting the “American Dream.”

 

As we made our way down, we were suddenly surrounded by trees. 

  
A growing feeling had begun in my stomach ever since we passed the sign marking the outskirts of town.

  
It had crept up, inflating like a balloon as we made our descent. Now it was on my chest, restricting my lungs, making it hard to breathe.

 

Images of my brother came to me. 

  
His warm smile. His tight embrace every time I made it home okay.

  
Flashes of those nights I crept into his room, crying more often than not, because the sounds outside made it hard to fall asleep.

  
I tried not to let my imagination run loose, but I couldn’t help picturing his final moments.  
My mother refused to tell me any details.

  
I keep imagining him by himself, the trees closing in. All alone.

  
Until he wasn’t.

 

The morbid picture show I’d conjured in my head came to a sudden stop when I realized Samantha had rolled her window all the way down. 

  
Her arm was out of the car, making waves in the air.

  
My heart crashed into my stomach, acid bubbling up to the surface, filling my mouth with a taste of sulfur.

 

"Samantha, honey, please roll your window up. You can turn on the A/C" I tried - attempting not to let the panic reach my voice. 

  
"What? Ugh, Mom, no" she started, "There’s freaking fresh air outside."

  
I couldn’t keep it bottled any longer. "Baby, please, please don’t do this. Close the window. Keep your arms inside" I shrieked, hearing something shift somewhere deep in the trees. Branches shattered. Leaves rustled violently.

  
"Mom, what the hell - look at the road. I’m just cooling off."

  
I started braking, trying to plead desperately, but only a series of wheezy noises escaped my tightening ribcage.

 

"Mom?" a small voice rose from the back. It was Eric. He was looking out his window. I only caught it for a split second, but he looked confused. And scared. 

  
That’s when I heard Sam scream.

  
Something had caught her arm.

  
I slammed on the brake as something wet hit my face in a jet.

  
It was coming from the passenger window.

  
Wrapped around my daughter’s arm were rows of putrid, brown-tinged teeth.

  
I saw her pale flesh contort under the tension of the vice around it - the lines of pressure giving way to highways of torn shreds, pulsating and gurgling in a violent spew of my own flesh and blood.

 

The car came to a violent stop, slamming my head against the windshield. 

  
My senses returned as I heard shouting.

  
Panic had filled the car.

  
I felt a warm river overflowing from my scalp, the blood making it hard to see from my left eye.

 

"MOM MOM OH GOD MOM, SAM’S OUT OF THE CAR!" 

  
The shouting was from Eric. He was shrieking, banging his hands desperately on the glass.  
I turned toward the passenger seat.

  
Empty.

  
Where my daughter had sat, there was only a pool of gore.

  
Looking out the window, I saw it - a sack of lumpy meat in a vaguely humanoid drape of skin. It sat on the ground, its back to me.

  
Its bald head bobbed reverently. Its body was too thin. Irregular patches of dirty, wire-thin hair covered its gangly limbs, bent at crooked angles.

  
The bobbing stopped - its meal interrupted by my son’s bloody shrieks.  
It turned rapidly.

 

It... 

  
Its mouth was a mess of sagging skin, hiding an abyss of crooked razorblades.

  
I saw her hair - her pretty blonde hair - caught between them.

  
I wanted to cry out in horror. I wanted to yell.

  
I wanted to get out of the car and do… **something.**

  
I couldn’t.

  
And the reason was that the beast’s black, beady eyes weren’t on me.

  
They were fixed on Eric.

 

I threw the car in drive and floored it. 

  
I didn’t look in the rearview mirror. I didn’t listen to Eric’s shouts and pleas to turn the car around as they morphed into wails of gut-wrenching grief.

  
I focused on the road.

  
I only broke focus slightly - to roll the passenger window up.
