It’s been four days I’ve been stuck here. 

I’m not even sure if “days” is the right word. Time itself doesn’t even seem to have logic to it. My phone died on 86% and every last clock I’ve seen have some weird symbol that don’t even resemble numbers… 

the sun rises and sets yes, but yesterday the sun was frozen in the sky for what felt like an eternity. Yesterday it up and down in what I assume was just a few minutes. Same with the moon too…

I’m not even sure how I wound up here. The last thing I remember was sitting in the living room with my sister watching season two of Squid Game. My boyfriend called me and I stepped onto the balcony to talk to him. The next thing I knew I was standing in front of some random movie theater. No flashing light, no buzzing. Nothing. I blinked and I was here.

Ran around like crazy at first, screaming for ANYONE. But every store I ran into was deserted. Every store looked just liked it should- the grocery store was fully stocked, the clothing stores had plenty on the racks, even the movie theater had what was clearly freshly popped popcorn. But there wasn’t anyone around. 

I tried calling 911 at least a hundred times before my phone died way before it should’ve. Not that it mattered- I didn’t have a single bar of signal. I got so desperate I settled on breaking into a car and hot wiring it, but I gave up after I drove for a solid hour and somehow got right back to the outskirts of the town. I broke into a house to stay for the night. I felt guilty at first, seeing all the family photos. I looked closer and they were more like the AI generated ones- like when you tell ChatGPT to make you an image of a person and it’s very nearly realistic, but definitely not it. I’ve slept here every night. The fridge is fully stocked and the trash is always gone when I wake up, even though I’ve never taken it out. I’ve been sleeping with the dresser barricaded against the door as a precaution. 

I haven’t seen a single person since I’ve been here. Come to think of it, I haven’t heard so much as a cricket chirping. 

I don’t do anything all day. The books in this house are all either completely blank or filled in with the same gibberish the clocks have. The computers and TV don’t turn on either even though they look fine. I even checked out other houses too- same story. 

It’s the start of day five now. Like every morning since I do the same thing- get up, try to guess the time based on how high the sun is, and go downstairs for food. The dresser and closet are full of clothes my size, but I refuse to wear them. I’ve just reached the kitchen when I see an envelope on the island. I’m absolutely certain it wasn’t there before. To my horror, the note has one word written on the outside, “Lauren”. 

Immediately my mind starts racing. They know my name? How? Is it the same person who brought me here? Am I here on purpose? 

Only one way to find out… with my hands trembling, I shakily open the envelope and unfold the surprisingly sparse letter. My stomach sinks as I read the contents.

“Do you want to leave?”
