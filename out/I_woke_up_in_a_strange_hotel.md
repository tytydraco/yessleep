I don't really remember much, nor have I told anyone about this but I need some closure. For context, my wife was in labour and there was black ice all over the road. You can probably guess where it went from there. There was a moose in the middle of the highway and I swerved into a lake. I still remember the screams of my wife, trying to swim up but to no avail.

 I can't recall much after that but I woke up in a 2000's era modern-ish hotel. Rubbing the groggines from my eyes was when I felt it, my clothes where all wet and I was having a hard time to breath, but eventually chalked it up to the AC being too cold.

Next thing I knew was the feeling of water droplets hitting my forehead, I looked up but saw nothing. "Maybe I'm just too tired" I thought. I went to the bathroom to rinse my face. After that I felt the strong urge to look above me, there I saw what could only be described as a monster, an entity. To help u picture this better imagine the girl from the ring, yes the one that crawled up the well. That's exactly what it looked like.

It shot a look of... I'm not sure, maybe guilt, envy, despair, rage, sympathy? It was hard to tell but I bolted it. I ran into rooms with people scratching the walls till their nails tore of the flesh, people brushing their teeth until their gums turned white, you get the idea.

On the last room, I saw a figure that looked like it had ascended from the bottom of the abyss, from hell. It had skulls filling the void where their eyes should be and a long black beak. It had a long black robe and silky glass hair. It grabbed my ankle before I was able to get out of that hell hole. 

Right as it was opening its never ending mouth to devour me, the woman from earlier tackled it down and screeched at me to leave in an inhuman voice.

I ran out and saw dozens more of those twisted beings all racing towards me, but I saw a gate of light that was... getting farther put reach. Still I felt as if i had missed something. I just couldn't shake the feeling away but I ran with all my remaining strength and I'm not so glad but grateful to say I made it. 

Right when I was blacking out, I saw the woman from earlier, this time with long neat black hair. And a warm melancholy smile looking at me, after that I awoke in a hospital. I read the name of it on a cup next to me, "Sacred Heart Hospital" sounded familiar. Then it all hit me, my beautiful wife, the crash.

Just then nurses came rushing into my room with their jaw dropped. "H-hes alive? That's a miracle!" One cheered. All I wanted to know at the moment was "Where's my..w-wife?" I didn't realize I voiced out my thought. A worried nurse came into my room with her head down "I'm so sorry sir, your wife and the baby didn't make it, but you should be grateful your still here. You were dead just 2 minutes ago you know."

At that moment, all the dots connected in my head. I knew that woman...the thing I had left behind was my wife.
