Thanks to the advice everyone gave me, it really helped clear my head and get me moving in a productive direction. It's been a hell of a journey from the [beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/IOFHnUa01N) until now, but I think it's finally over.

After everything that happened at the motel I was left destitute and without options. 

I managed to find a homeless shelter of sorts. It was just a church that opened their basement to people down on their luck. They preached some sort of sermon while feeding us which was a fair enough deal to me. By that point I hadn’t eaten in three days. 

A few people tried talking to me but I made it pretty clear I wasn’t in the mood and they backed off. 

I slept that night uninterrupted, I felt human again. 

I still wanted to leave the country, I knew it would be hard without money but I couldn’t stay where I could be found. John had suggested distance and I would follow that plan even though I had to do it alone. 

At first I thought I would just walk, buses cost money and would be hard to escape from in an emergency. But then I realized just how slow walking is, it took me half a day just to get outside the city limits. 

It was over a hundred miles to the nearest border, and something like ten times that to get to the border I wanted to get to! 

So I started hitch hiking, I know it’s dangerous but I had lost my fear of people by that point. John had been right, there are some things worse than death. And being caught and turned into a squid monster was one of them. 

It surprised me how many people were willing to pick up a stranger. I met farmers, hippies, construction workers and a priest before reaching the state line. 

I hadn’t let down my guard though, so it didn’t take me long to notice the same car passing me twice. When I thought I caught glimpse of it rounding a bend ahead of me for a third pass I acted quickly. 

When they went through a dip in the road I dive into the adjourning corn field. I was able to get fairly deep into the field before the car slowly drove past. The plants were too thick for me to see the driver but I could clearly make out that it was the same white Honda that had driven past twice before. 

The car came to a stop, my heart leapt into my throat. It beat so loudly I could of sworn they were able to hear it. 

My footprints! Of course! The field was smooth dirt between the rows of corn. Except for the spot where my footprints led into the field. 

The time for stealth was over. I sprinted with all my might away from the road. The corn leaves whipped at my face with a surprising amount of pain. I was surely bleeding by now. 

I imagined the tentacles reaching for me, grasping me, ripping me apart! 

My heart missed a beat, I gasped in pain and stumbled. I hit the ground hard. I couldn’t breath, I couldn’t inhale. I lay there, my body trembling before I managed to get air into my lungs. 

I hadn’t been caught, I looked around the surrounding stalks. I was alone. The field was silent. 

I sat there until I recovered enough to stand. I was lost. The corn was higher than my head and I had no idea which way I had ran. 

I could see the sun so I knew which way west was but I didn’t know what was to the west. Or what was in any direction for that matter. 

What I did know is that I only had so much energy and water in my body so if I was going to get out I had better start walking. 

I followed the corn rows until it grew dark, finally I broke out of the monotonous plants. In front of me stood a rather old looking barn, it only had three walls and a roof. It was filled with hay bales all nearly stacked on its raised floor.
 
Beyond it was a grassy pasture and beyond that was more corn. But there was a road leading to the barn, come morning I would be able to follow the road out of these corn fields. 

There was a water trough behind the barn, I took the hose from it and drank my fill. After a dinner of uncooked underripe corn on the cob I laid down on a bed of hay. 

It was less comfortable than movies make it out to be but it was better than the dirt. It didn’t take me long to nod off. 

I woke up with a start, my brain fog cleared and I remembered where I was. Energy jolted through me and I jumped to my feet. 

Someone stood at the far end of the barn. I back away slowly, I felt the wall behind me. I was trapped. Trapped by a girl, the tension in my chest started to ease a little. 

At the far side of the barn stood a girl of maybe 16 years, with her plaid shirt, blue jeans and braids she looked almost comically like someone on TV acting like a farmer. 

She looked unnervingly calm, “sleep well did you now?” she seemed more amused by my presence than worried. 

“I uhh, yeah actually I did”. I replied. She leaned on a pitchfork, “I got a question for you sleepyhead”. I was starting to relax some, she seemed to pose no threat. “And what’s that?” 

She pointed to the hay bales around me, “are ya gonna feed that to the horses since you busted it up or am I gonna call the sheriff?” 

It seemed like a fair deal to me, she didn’t want to do her chores and I didn’t want to go to jail. 

She showed me where I would be moving the hay to and how much. With that she got on a four-wheeler and left. I thought about just leaving but that didn’t feel right. 

I took me an hour to finish my allotted work, just as I was dragging the last bale to the feeder I heard the four-wheeler returning. The girl climbed off, “not bad, brought ya something”. 

Sure enough she had a paper plate with tinfoil covering it, “I figured a feller hungry enough to eat cattle corn might appreciate some breakfast”. 

I tried to thank her but she waved me off, “people fall on hard times. Pass it on to the next person. That being said, I do expect you to be gone when I come back tonight”. 

I wolfed down the food, when I was done the girl had left. I realized I hadn’t even gotten her name. Honoring her request I returned to the main road and began walking once more. 

I managed to get a few more rides, I was in a new state by night fall. I was going to make it, it might take the kindness of strangers to get me there but I would get away from those things chasing me. 

I found a farmer willing to let me stay in his barn for the night in exchange for helping him do some maintenance on some sort of corn chopper thing. I wasn’t very helpful but he seemed grateful for the company as he spent more time talking then he did working. 

He retired to the house and I to the barn. I woke up with the sun rise, not because I wanted to but because the farmers rooster was screaming his lungs out two feet from my head. 

I made good time, the same farmer was going to town so he gave me a ride. From there I knew I would be able to raise some money and buy a meal. 

I spent a couple hours trying to find some odd jobs to earn some food but came up dry, the towns atmosphere made me think begging wouldn’t be any more fruitful. I went to cross the street when my body froze.

Terror flowed through me for a moment, a white Honda was parked across the street from me. I tried to breath regularly, those things were everywhere. It was just a coincidence. There was no way anyone had tracked me here, it just wasn’t possible. 

Still, I waited near enough to watch the car but far enough to make an escape. 

I waited for a long time, finally a brunette approached the car. She had on jeans and a hoodie, her hair was down and she had on a ball cap. I couldn’t see her face, and at the distance I was watching from I couldn’t even make out her figure. I could just as well have been a man with long hair and tight jeans.

But it was close enough to something that might be trouble so I got ready to leave town. I could wait until tomorrow to eat, better to live hungry than to die well fed. 

I waited until I had the cover of darkness to sneak down to the creek that ran through town. I followed it into the woods, if there was a car following me I would simply go where no car could go. 

I walked until dawn, by then I had emerged from the woods and was back on a small road leading from farm to farm. 

A few tractors passed me throughout the day, I waved and they waved back. It wasn’t until I heard a vehicle slowing behind me that I felt nervous, I turned my head slowly unsure if I wanted to know what was approaching. 

It wasn't a white a Honda, I exhaled in relief. It was a shiny black pickup pulling a horse trailer. It slowed more as it pulled up beside me. Finally it stopped, the windows were too dark for me to see inside. 

I was uneasy for a moment but then the passenger window rolled revealing the grinning face of the girl who had fed me after my escape through the corn. 

“Well lookie here, small world ain’t it?” the driver, a slightly older boy with a similar look to him leaned forward to see past what I assumed was his sister. “This here’s the feller that was passed out in the hay loft”. The boy seemed to eye me more cautiously than his sister. 

“Where you off to?” he asked. I pointed down the road, “just where wherever this leads, hopefully to another town”. 

The boy nodded slowly, he had a piece of straw in his mouth that he kept rolling back and forth. It was a little weird but I guess it’s healthier than smoking. 

“Get in if you want a ride, we’re heading to the fairgrounds”. I was about to decline but in the distance I saw something on the road, something white. 

I climbed into the truck, it was one of those trucks with four doors and the wide hips in the back. The boy rolled up the windows, I was glad for it because not five minutes later a white Honda sped past. 

I felt my heart sink, that was too many coincidences. I wasn’t as safe as I had assumed. 

The boy spoke up, “friends of yours?” “Pardon?” he was looking at me in the rearview. “That car, friends of yours?” I shook my head, “no”. “Enemies?” I shook my head again, “no, at least not that I know of. And I would rather not find out”. 

He nodded slowly before returning his eyes to the road. I was impressed with how quiet and smooth the truck was, I was actually struggling to stay awake. 

The boy started humming along with the radio, as if practiced his sister joined in on the chorus. They each sang opposing parts to the song and actually weren’t half bad. 

And it broke my heart, the way the two siblings just effortlessly knew what the other was going to do. I never had the kind of relationship with John. And now I never would. 

My depression got so bad that when we pulled up to the fairgrounds I got out without saying a word and walked away. I heard the girl make some sort of comment but I wasn’t listening. 

I needed some space. I needed to breath, my chest was tight and my heart was choking me. 

I found myself wandering an industrial complex, it looked to have been closed for decades. The solitude did me good, I screamed, I threw things. I smashed windows. I let out all the pain, the anger, the loss. I let everything just flow out. I fell to my knees sobbing. 

I missed John, I missed my parents. I resented leaving college. I hated myself for the years I wasted high or drunk. 

We didn’t have a close bond but John really had always been there for me. When our parents died he took care of everything while I wallowed in self pity. When I was in trouble with the law he always got me out. I must have cost him thousands in bail money and attorneys over the years. 

And then Rachel returns, John didn’t question me. He didn’t kick me out, no he sacrificed everything he had to keep me safe. He even knew what size clothes I wear! I couldn’t even tell you his favorite color. And in the end he gave his last breath while I ran. 

We didn’t grow up playing together, but John had been the best brother he could while dealing with his own demons. The guy got two purple hearts and lost his parents within a year and I never even asked how he was doing. 

I had never felt this low before, the more I looked back on the last decade of my life the more I wished it had been me that had been taken. 

Somewhere glass crunched. I froze, my thoughts snapping to the here and now. I got off my knees, the buildings that acted as my emotional release were now looming all around me. Constricting me. 

Papers blew in the slight breeze, the only other noise to be heard was the chirping of birds. 

Had I imagined it? Had my brain finally cracked? 

I knew someone was behind me, I could feel them watching me. I could feel their eyes on my back. I didn’t need to turn. 

I ran, knees to chest ran. I was at top speed in seconds. And then I was skidding across the ground. My body collided with a concrete wall sending pain throughout me. 

As I gasped for air someone landed on me, her hair fell in my face. She was attempting to grab my wrists! All I could think about was those tentacles forcing their way down my throat. I arched my back throwing my attacker to the side. 

I nearly made it to my feet when something hard struck my head. I fell face down onto the ground. My body wasn’t obeying my commands. I couldn’t move, someone was holding me down. 

Muddled voices spoke all around me. I couldn’t move, this was it. They had found me and trapped me! I was going to die now. 

I was pulled to my feet, my head was buzzing and I couldn’t get my legs under me. Next thing I knew I was in the back seat of a car speeding out of town. 

My vision was coming back, the world was still spinning but it wasn’t as bad. I flexed my fingers, good my hands were working again. I tried to sit up but found my arms were tied to my torso. My legs were tied together as well. 

My grunting alerted the two people in the front seat, two people I had hoped would never cross my path again. 

John drove the car, his face stone cold and emotionless. Next him sat Rachel. She glanced back but didn’t make a comment. 

I pulled at the ropes, I tried to do what they do in movies and free myself by dislocating my shoulder. But all I managed to do was give myself a cramp that I couldn’t escape. 

The creature wearing John's skin drove us up to some sort of factory. He parked the car inside of a large building with few windows, him and Rachel got out of the car and talked about something behind the vehicle where I couldn’t see or hear them. 

The door near my head opened and John grabbed my shoulders, he started to pull me out of the vehicle. I tried to kick and scream but all I accomplished was getting dropped on my head and then gagged. 

They took me to a back room where they threw me on a thick wooden table that looked like it used to be used for architect plans. 

“How do we know they haven't got to him?” Asked Rachel. John shrugged “fuck if I know, I would rather not open him up we can avoid it”. 

I felt panic rise up in me, I tried to wiggle my way out of the bonds but it was no use. Rachel placed a hand on me and glared up at John, “don't say things like that out loud. You’re going to freak him out”. John laughed, “he's a chicken shit, the dude is scared of everything”. 

Rachel just shook her head, “still. Let's try to keep the stress levels down if we can okay?” She then leaned in close to me, she seemed to be studying me. “Hey there Dax, there's not really much of a point in asking but did those things get you? Did they.. you know”. She gestured towards her open mouth and made a gagging noise. 

“What she trying to ask” said John “is did you get throat fucked by the squid things or are you still you?” I was confused, I looked back and forth at the two of them. They were acting weird, but not like tentacle monster weird. 

They must have noticed the confusion in my eyes because John took a seat in a nearby office chair. “I think you are owed an explanation. A lot has happened since the motel”. 

“While the bitch was chasing you around the building I was stuck dealing with that tentacle thing”. He explained, “I had managed to blind it but it was still beating the crap out of me. Somehow I got my blade into its chest, it screamed for a bit and flailed but then finally went down. It was right about then that Rachel came back in”. 

“I subdued her then after setting fire to the motel room I drug her into the car that her and that thing had arrived in. I needed answers, you were long gone and I didn't know where you had headed off to. Somehow these things were able to continue to find us and I needed to know how”. 

John smirked at Rachel. “Once she woke up I use some creative questioning tactics in an attempt to get answers”.

“Apparently that thing inside her was not a big fan, it tried its best to get out and probably would have killed her in the process if I hadn't opened up the base of her throat with a knife”. 

“I thought it  actually had killed her at first since she convulsed for a while before going limp. But I was able to resuscitate her, and after a bit of confusion she seemed to figure out where she was and what had happened. Those things control the body of their host, but the person is still aware of everything that's happening”. 

Racial shivered at the thought, the memory appear to make her ill as she walked to the far side of the room and dry heaved into the corner. 

John walked over to me, “okay little bro I'm going to remove the gag and cut these ropes off you. No freaking out you got it?” I nodded and he started by taking the belt they used to gag me off of my head. Once the ropes fell loose I was able to move myself around some and start to get feeling back into my limbs. 

I was suspicious of both of them, I didn’t want to be. Their story conveniently explained everything. It would be so easy to welcome them, I wanted to so badly. I wanted this to be over, to have a second chance with John. But how could I trust their word alone? 

I decide to show my cards, at this point I didn’t have much to lose. “And you expect me to believe all that?” I asked. John chuckled, “well kind of, I mean obviously you should be skeptical but you’ve never been all that bright”.

If this thing wasn’t John than it sure knew how to act like him. Rachel returned from her episode in the corner, “Dax if we wanted to kill you or put one of those things in you why would we untie you?” 

She had a point, but while I might be willing to trust John Rachel had a long ways to go yet. “How are you even alive?” I blurted out. 

She didn’t seen taken aback by my question, she settled into the chair. Her skin was pale and she was sweating, maybe she wasn’t doing as well as I first thought. “I guess mostly luck?” 

John spoke, “I hit her with a .410 loaded with bird shot, it’s what I had available. I’m not that shocked that she survived. Especially since her partner got to her right after we left. The embryo leaving her body did the most damage and it might still prove to be deadly”. 

She really did look like she was barely hanging on. 

“Alright, let’s say I believe you. I believe this whole story where you fought off the creature, where Rachel is cured from her possession and you’re both here to help. How did you find me?” 

Rachel pointed at my leg. “Your wound, you got blood from when you slashed Gary into your leg during your scuffle. It was enough to strengthen the telekinetic bond, The Children were able to catch glimpses of your thoughts. One of which was a motel name”. 

It made sense, but then… I jumped to my feet, “doesn’t that mean they know where I am right now and could be coming here?” I looked around wildly expecting something to come creepy out of every crevice. 

“Woah now” Rachel placed a hand on my shoulder, “relax, you’re ok. The affect was weakening rapidly, it’s all but gone by now. Plus you have no idea where you are, even if they could see through your eyes right now it wouldn’t do them any good”.

I removed her hand, her gesture was anything but calming. 

“Then how did the two of you find me?” It was John that answered, “got lucky and saw you hitch hiking, we lost you for a bit but it’s not like you were covering a ton of ground”. 

Again they had a convenient but entirely possible answer. 

I looked at John, the nonchalant way he stood there. Acting like he didn’t give a shit what I decided. Then there was Rachel, her eyes full of concern. Her body nearly expired but her spirit still holding strong. 

These were my people, and if I was wrong about that I was ok with the consequences. 

UPDATE: So we made it, we’re out of the US. Rachel was able to answer most of my questions. Things like why The Children came for me, what their goals are, why they’re so unknown. 

I’m not going to say where we went, but I will say we are not entirely safe. We found one those things near by. We disposed of it but it led to a deeper discussion. 

Do we have a moral obligation to find and expose these things? I don’t know, nor do I know if there will be another update. 

Stay safe out there.
