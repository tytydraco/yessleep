Hey guys, I’m alive. Things got a little [hairy](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/rTizBUbrSj) and I didn’t have much time for an update but I think I’m safe, for now at least. 

We drove deep into the woods, John was quiet most of the drive. I didn’t know if he was thinking about our next step or about what happened with Rachel. 

It had to have been two hours of driving down a winding gravel road before John pulled into a large open area. 

It was like a giant had taken a scoop out of the earth, crumbling rock walls closed us in on three sides. John parked the car by some piles of trash. 

“Help me with the bodies” he commanded. I could tell he was hurting. Those things had really worked him over. He popped the trunk, I nearly retched at the smell. It was something like fish left in the sun with a hint of copper and shit.

My skin crawled as we did our best to pull them from the trunk without getting bodily fluids all over us. 

John and I placed one of the bodies in the driver’s seat. A limp slick hand brushed mine.

I felt bile rise up in my throat, I tried to turn and puke on the ground but John grabbed my head and directed it onto the body. 

I stumbled back spiting and looking at the body in horror, “what the actual fuck John?” 

He wasn’t disturbed in the least bit, “dna. Maybe it’ll help throw them off for a bit. Who knows”. 

I refused to help him the next body, which he placed in he passenger seat. He then ordered me to strip down. Once we were both naked he took a can of gas from the trunk and dumped it all over the interior of the car. 

Grabbing a near by piece of garbage he lit it and threw it into the gas soaked car. There was a might womp as the accelerant ignited into a ball of fire. I felt the heat on my bare skin. 

John tossed his cigarette into the fire before turning away from it and walking towards the wood line. I awkwardly followed him painfully aware of my nudity. 

As we got closer I saw a beat up old red pickup. Maybe a 80’s Toyota or something, I was never that good at identifying cars. 

“Where did that come from?” I asked. John grabbed an unfamiliar duffle bag from the back. “A friend dropped it off along with these”. He threw me some clothes, they weren’t mine but surprisingly they were the right size. John got dressed as well. 

He fired up the pickup, “alright, let’s get going”. I climbed in, the truck smelled like river bottom. The sheet metal floor boards were rusted and covered in mud. The bench seat was cracked and had springs showing. The whole truck rattled as we drove back the way we came. I looked at the now dying fire behind us. I had nothing left, everything I owned was either at the house I couldn’t return to or turned to ashes. 

John’s voice jerked me back to the present. “Start at the beginning, tell me everything that happened. Every single detail, I want to know what we’re up against”. I nodded, I told him about the night this began. I told him about the incident at the house and police station. He listened quietly, never interrupting me or showing any kind of doubt. 

“So what’s the plan?” I asked. He tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, “sounds like we’re fucked seven ways to Sunday. So I guess step one is going to be unfucking ourselves”. I waited but he didn’t elaborate. 

“Ok and how do we do that?”  “We create distance between ourselves and the problem. So for now let’s just focus on that”. 

At some point early in the morning we got on an asphalt road. Thankfully the truck rode a lot better after leaving the gravel behind. We made a pit stop for gas and some food. 

I came out of the secluded mini mart to find John chatting away with a sheriff’s deputy. My heart leapt into my throat. John waved at the officer as he climbed into his patrol car and left. 

Letting out a nervous sigh I walked over to John, “what did he want?” I asked. John pulled the fuel nozzle from the truck, “there’s no plates on the truck. I told him I must have forgotten them along with my foot. He’s a fellow jar head and told me get it fixed when I can and to have a nice day”.

“I thought you were in the army?” John opened the driver’s door and got in, “fuck no, I earned my paychecks”.

I didn’t bother asking where we were going, John pulled onto the highway and we continued our journey. Around noon John got off the freeway and turned down a secluded back road. 

The road turned to gravel, then we pulled off the gravel and onto a two track dirt path. John seemed to know where he was going, he never checked a map and our phones were gone so he must have memorized the route at some point. 

We crested a hill and the overbearing trees opened up to a clearing. In the middle of the hill top clearing stood a small shack. Or maybe it qualified as a cabin, either way it just a few hundred square feet and a single story. 

It had a porch that wrapped around the entirety of the building. And on the porch sitting in a rocking chair was a man who looked older than the hill his house sat on. At his feet lay an equally old hound dog and across his lap was a lever action rifle. 

John didn’t hesitate, he shut the truck off and put in gear. He left the truck and approached the old man, “morning ya old geezer”. 

The old man didn’t smile, nor did he check his watch. He spit a stream of tobacco and replied, “morning has come and gone cocksucker. State your business or get lost”. 

John knelt down and scratched the dog’s ears, at least the animal seemed friendly. John waved me over, I hesitantly left the truck. The old man watched me with cold eyes. 

A chill ran down my spine, there was something about him. I knew just by his gaze that the rifle was mostly for show. If he wanted to hurt me he wouldn’t need anything more than his bare hands. 

John pointed at me as I walked up, “this is my brother. He’s in trouble and now so am I”. The old man’s gaze drifted from John to me. “Ya? Fucktards be getting in trouble all the time, damned if that’s any business of mine”. 

John leaned against the railing, “hear me out sir. This isn’t normal trouble, Dax stumbled across something… extra”. The old man stood, the barrel of his rifle lazily drifted in my direction. He kept his eyes on John, “quit wasting time boy, what’s chasing you?” 

John seemed at a loss of words, and that rifle was making me really nervous. “body snatching alien squid people” I blurted out. The man looked at me then back at John. His rifle now pointing at the ground he turned and walked into the house. “Don’t leave the damn door open on your way in” he called from inside. 

Inside was unexpected, one wall was entirely covered in bookshelves. There was a small bed, a chair and desk then a tiny kitchen. It was just a single roomed house but it was neat and organized.

Seeing as the man took the only chair John and I stood. I told the man everything that had happened. Those cold eyes seemingly reading my very soul. 

When my tale was told he sat there thinking for a bit. “Shitstick, behind you. Blue spine, fourth row up”. John turned and grabbed the book, he handed it to the man. 

The man opened the book and thumbed through the pages before turning it so we could see an illustration. 

It was an old hand drawn image, a man stood in the woods with his hands held high in surrender. Near him was another man, this one standing high above the first. The man was not larger but rather he stood on two long tentacles that protruded from his chest while two other tentacles reached for the first character. 

It was eerily similar to the things chasing us. The man slammed the book shut. “Legend has it they call themselves The Children. Children of what I don’t know, there’s about two lines of text that references them”. John ran his fingers through his long hair. “I know this was a bit of a hail Mary but there has to be something more. Something we can actually use!” 

The man's eyes narrowed, “I gave you what I got. If you can’t make due with that then too fucking bad. Time for you boys to start making tracks, you weren’t invited and have stayed long enough”. 

John nodded, he looked defeated. “Yes sir, we’ll be on our way”. We headed for the door, right before we left the man spoke up again. “Reach behind that door”. John did as he was told and pulled a pump shotgun out. “Don’t worry about bringing it back, and remember the policy we had in the caves”. 

John walked out onto the porch, I hesitated for a moment. The old man let the rifle in his hand swing in my direction. His look sent a shiver down my spine and I hurried after John. 

I waited until we were driving again to start asking questions. “Ok so who was that?” John propped the shotgun up between us, “sometimes the US military comes across things that require special attention. Guys like him are who they call in”. 

“Ok and you just happen to know where he lives?” “Yeah, we worked together a few times and got along pretty good”. 

If that was how he treated his friends I’d hate to be anyone he didn’t like. 

“What was that comment about the caves all about?” John sighed, he looked me dead in eye. “Listen bro, sometimes there are worse fucking things than dying. We were in a situation where we all knew it was better to bite a bullet than be taken. Or if it came to it, put a bullet in someone before they could be taken. Just, just don’t worry about that too much”. 

We drove to a crappy motel where we paid cash for a night. It felt good to crash on the bed and just take a moment to breath. John spent an hour in the bathroom cleaning himself up. 

He emerged sporting a buzz cut, he looked a lot better. He took the remote from me and flopped onto the bed. I hated to do it but I needed to know, “so what’s the plan?” John flipped through the channels for a bit before settling in SpongeBob. “fuck if I know bro, I think we need start looking into disappearing. Maybe leave the country, I’ve got a few contacts that might be able to help out in Cambodia. I don’t have end goal figured out yet”. 

There wasn’t much to say to that. After awhile I nodded off. My dreams were filled with carnage and twisted entities. They were so vivid it took me a moment too long to realize I was awake. 

I was violently thrown to the floor, I scrambled across the carpet. Against the far wall one of the tentacle creatures had its nasty appendage wrapped around John’s neck and was holding him off the ground. I jumped to my feet only to have a boot connect with my chest. I fell flat on my back, looking up I saw something I hoped never to see again. Rachel stood over me. From her chin down to her collar bone she was covered in bandages, her face was twisted into a angry grimace. 

I scrambled backwards trying to get away from her. For just a moment she was distracted by John shoving his thumb into the eye of the creature choking him. As the creature dropped him I ran into the bathroom and slammed the door shut. 

I could hear angry screams coming from Rachel as she pounded on the door. There was a tiny window in the bathroom, I had no other options. I threw the toilet tank lid into the glass shattering it. Climbing up a grabbed the edge, wincing as the sharp edges cut deep into my palms I thrust my shoulders through the opening. 

My thin build saved my life, I slipped all the way out and landed on the ground outside. 

I could still hear the carnage coming from inside the room. John had left the truck keys under the seat for an occasion just like this. 

I started the engine, “come on, come on!” I watched the door in the mirror, I was so intent on the door I almost didn’t see Rachel sprinting around the side of the building. “I’m sorry John”. 

I left, I drove away as fast as I could. I never saw anyone leave the front door. 

John escaped those things once, I pray he can do it again. I told  myself it’s what he would have wanted me to do. It still hurt. 

Two nights after that I was parked along side a dirt road trying to get some sleep. I hadn’t eaten since the motel. All I had had to drink was creak water. My guts were all twisted up inside. 

I was jerked awake by the sound of tires on gravel. I sat up and had my hand on the keys when a white car drove up. It slowed before coming to a stop a dozen feet away. 

The headlights kept me from seeing who was driving. Someone got out, their silhouette illuminated by the light behind them. I started the truck, they froze. With my heart beating fast I turned on my lights, John stood there. He raised his hand to shield his eyes. 

I put the truck in gear and he called out, “wait! Dax! It’s me!” He wasn’t alone, I could just make out a long haired passenger in the back seat of the car. The fuckers got him. 

My vision was blurry, my heart ached as I dropped the clutch. “Dax no! Wait!” I could barely see through the tears. 

I flew past John narrowly missing him. 

That was three days ago. The truck is out of gas. I didn’t have a penny to my name, I don’t have any identification on me. I don’t know who I can trust. I took a risk going into a library to post this but I need to hear something from someone. I’m alone, I’m hurt, they took everything from me. I’m scared.
