I needed closure, I had spent so long slogging through life because of what might have happened that night. I needed to know. 

I followed the instructions on Rachel’s note [context](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/sSDU4WqZeI) 

Maybe I was being stupid. I didn’t care, I was ready for this to end. 

The address she gave me was that of an older home across town. It wasn’t run down or giving off any massive red flags but it was well last its prime. 

I walked up the worn concrete steps, I knocked on the front door. My heart was beating painfully, my anxiety was at a peak. 

Actually I wasn’t ready for this to end, I could happily live my life not knowing for sure. The door opened. 

Rachel stood there in sweatpants and a T-shirt, she looked disappointed to see me. “You came”. There was a slight tremble to her voice. Her fists were clenched and she stood unnaturally stiff. 

Unsure of what to do I just stood there, both of us looking at the other and neither speaking. 

Rachel shuddered, almost violently. It seemed to snap her out of her weird trance. She waved me forward before walking back inside. She left the door open, I wanted to close the door and go home. But I also wanted answers. And Rachel didn’t seem to be doing so well, if she needed help I couldn’t just leave. 

Frustrated with myself I followed her. None of the lights in the house were on. It was lit by some windows but not very well, it had a dim atmosphere that put me off. 

My hand instinctively dropped to my waist, I felt the unfamiliar handle hidden under my shirt. It brought me some relief to know I wasn’t helpless. That morning on my way to Rachel’s I made a pit stop at Walmart and bought the biggest cleaver I could find 

Rachel was waiting in a bare room. She stood with her back to a hallway. There was no mistaking it, she was trembling to the point her knees were almost knocking together. 

I felt the surge of unholy energy swell up inside me, the tightening of my lower back, the lump in my throat. I hate suspense. 

Every speck of bravado fled my body. From the dark hallway behind Rachel emerged a single thick, wet tentacle. I got a better look this time, the top of it was a dark green and the bottom a lighter green. It looked very similar to the skin of a crocodile. 

A tear slipped down Rachel’s face. Her bottom lip quivered as the tentacle slowly wrapped itself around her neck. With a sudden yank Rachel was ripped off her feet and into the dark hallway. 

I fumbled for the cleaver, I needed to go. I got the cleaver out just as a figure revealed itself. My body locked up, I didn’t know his name but I recognized the guy from around town. 

Four of those awful tentacles protruded from bloody holes in his shirt. He spoke, I don’t know why I assumed he couldn’t but I had. 

“Welcome, you have been lost for a very long time. Come, return to your home”. I focused on not wetting myself. One of the tentacles reached out for me, it wasn’t moving very fast but it was enough to break my stupor and spur me into action. 

Dropping down I grabbed the cleaver, I felt the damn thing try to grab my shoulder. I swung with everything I had, the cleaver cut into the tentacle. It wasn’t a deep cut but the monster recoiled in shock. 

The man snarled in disgust, “you dare refuse our offering?” The injured tentacle curled up against his body. The other three flailed wildly about the room. 

I tried to crawl away, the thing grabbed my leg. It squeezed so damn hard. I hacked at it but it wouldn’t let go. It flung me into the wall. My body ended up crashing all the way through it and I landed dazed in another room. 

Tentacles began ripping away drywall and boards enlarging the hole. I scrambled to my feet. My leg was bruised and didn’t feel good but I pressed on. 

I made it out the door before the thing got in. Doing my best to run I finally made it to my car. The keys were missing, I had left them in the ignition just in case I had to make a quick getaway. I couldn’t stay, that thing was coming.

Getting out of the car I made my way down the street, I turned down random alleys and hopped fences when ever I could. 

After a bit I felt like I was somewhat safe. I hadn’t seen anyone following me. 

I felt like I was going crazy, there was no way that all just happened. 

Those kids that were at the party where this all started weren’t missing, I looked them up before going to meet Rachel. They were all living normal lives. This had to be a mental breakdown. 

After walking for an hour the pain in my leg convinced me to call an Uber to get home. 

I pulled out my phone and saw I had ten missed calls from my brother, panic swept through me. He left a voicemail. Shaking I opened it. 

“Yo pick up your damn phone, that girl is here again”. 

I called him back over and over but it went straight to voicemail. 

Fuck me. 

Now what?
