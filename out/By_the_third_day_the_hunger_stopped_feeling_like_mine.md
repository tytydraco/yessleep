After the men ran, my father and I didn’t talk much.

There wasn’t anything left to say that wouldn’t break us.

The city below kept floating dead past us like it was trying to show us what we’d become if we stopped moving. The water moved slowly now, lazy, dragging bodies through alleyways and around broken streetlights like toys. Sometimes a hand would bump the side of our building and disappear again. Sometimes a face would rises up, stare at nothing, then roll away.

I stopped counting how many bodies I saw. It felt wrong to count. Like turning them into numbers was another way of killing them.

My father sat against the wall with the crowbar across his lap, his eyes open but empty. Not asleep. I just went somewhere I couldn’t follow.

We had almost no food left.

Two bottles of water. One packet of dry noodles. A handful of rice that we couldn’t even cook properly anymore. My mother’s bag was still there, soaked and ripped open from the wave. Her clothes were spread out like the rooftop had vomited them. Every time I looked at them my chest tightened in a way that didn’t feel like crying. It felt like something stuck inside me.

That first night after the attack, I didn’t sleep.

Not because I was scared.

Because I kept listening for footsteps.

Every creak. Every drip of water. Every distant voice carried by the wind made my muscles tense like a trap ready to snap. I held the rusted pipe until my hands cramped. My father held the crowbar the same way, like if he let go, the world would swallow him.

At some point the sky darkened even more and rain began to fall.

At first I thought it was normal rain. I almost wanted to laugh. I almost wanted to thank God, because rain meant water, and water meant time.

Then the smell hit.

It wasn’t fresh. It wasn’t clean. It smelled like rust and chemicals and something sour, like rotting fish. The drops looked wrong on my skin, too dark, too thick. When it touched my arms it burned like tiny needles.

My father pulled a plastic sheet over us and shoved us against the wall. We sat there coughing, eyes stinging, listening to the rain hammer the broken city.

When it stopped, my father’s arms were covered in red spots. He didn’t complain. He didn’t even look at them. He just kept staring out over the flooded streets like he was waiting for something to rise up.

On the morning of the second day, the hunger started getting loud.

Not the kind that makes your stomach growl.

The kind that makes you feel hollow behind your eyes.

Like something is eating you from the inside.

We split the last noodles dry, chewing slowly to trick our bodies. It didn’t work. My tongue felt like sand. My lips cracked. My throat hurts from swallowing air.

By evening, my father finally spoke.

“I’m going to look for water.”

“No,” I said immediately, too fast. The word came out sharp and ugly. “Don’t go.”

He looked at me like he hadn’t remembered I existed until that moment. His face was pale. His eye was still swollen from the crowbar hit. Blood had dried in his hair.

“We’ll die here if I don’t,” he said.

“But if you leave ” I couldn’t finish the sentence. I couldn’t say they’ll kill you. I couldn’t say you’ll leave me alone.

He didn’t answer. He just stood up slowly and checked the edge of the rooftop like he was measuring how much of the world was still there.

He didn’t go.

Not that night.

Maybe because he saw the bodies floating closer. Maybe because he saw shadows moving on other rooftops. Maybe because he knew what I knew now.

The flood was only half the danger.

The survivors were the rest.

That night, the voices came again.

Not friendly voices. Not even loud ones.

Three people this time.

A woman and two men.

They climbed over a broken balcony onto our roof like they’d done it a hundred times. They looked thin and sick. Their skin was too tight over their bones. Their eyes were wide and hungry, like animals that hadn’t eaten in weeks.

The woman had no shoes. Her feet were cut up and bleeding. One of the men had only one eye, and the other held a knife with a shirt wrapped around the handle to keep it from slipping.

They didn’t rush us.

They didn’t need to.

They stood there and stared, and that stare was worse than screaming.

The woman lifted her hands. “We’re just looking for food.”

My father raised the crowbar. His arms shook but he didn’t drop it. “There’s nothing here.”

They didn’t believe him.

No one believed anyone anymore.

They moved forward anyway.

The fight wasn’t fast like the last one.

It was messy.

Desperate.

The one-eyed man lunged first. My father swung the crowbar and caught him in the ribs. The sound was like breaking wet wood. The man cried out and fell back, but the other man was already grabbing my leg, trying to pull me down.

I kicked him in the face and felt my heel connect with teeth.

The woman rushed my father, screaming now, swinging something sharp. My father hit her once, hard.

Her neck twisted wrong.

She dropped like a doll.

For a second everything stopped.

The wind. The water. Even my breathing.

And then my father dropped too.

The one-eyed man had a knife in his hand and he drove it into my father’s stomach like he was pushing it into a sack.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

My father made a sound I’ve never heard before. Not a scream. Not a shout. Just a wet, shocked gasp, like his body couldn’t understand what was happening to it.

I didn’t think.

I grabbed the pipe and swung until my arms went numb.

I hit the one-eyed man again.

And again.

And again.

I didn’t stop until he was still.

The other man tried to crawl away. I don’t remember hitting him. I only remember the sound his head made when it met the concrete.

Then there was silence.

The kind of silence that feels like the world is watching you breathe.

My father lay on the ground with blood pouring from between his fingers where he tried to hold himself together. His eyes were wide. His mouth moved like he was trying to say something.

I crawled to him, hands shaking.

“Dad,” I whispered. “Dad, stay with me.”

He looked at me like he wanted to apologize.

Then a bubble of red bloomed on his lips.

And he stopped moving.

I didn’t scream.

I didn’t cry.

I just sat there beside him, staring at his face like if I stared long enough, he’d change his mind.

Three dead strangers on the rooftop.

My father died in front of me.

My mother is under a satellite dish.

And the city below is still drowning.

My stomach twisted in pain, sharp and sick.

Not grief.

Hunger.

That’s the part nobody tells you about.

When everything is gone, your body doesn’t care about your feelings.

It just demands to live.

I sat there through the night, listening to the water below lap against the building like it was chewing.

By the time the sun rose again, the rooftop smelled like blood and salt.

And I was alone.

If you’re still reading this… then you already know what I’m about to say next.

Because the third day was when the hunger stopped feeling like mine.
