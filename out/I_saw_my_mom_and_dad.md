I have always been incredibly proud of my parents and our home—a place filled with stories and a sense of security. I vividly remember the day I introduced Inês to my parents. I was anxious and, in a way, nervous, but also happy to share with her something I’ve always held dear.

When we arrived at the house, the soft light of a summer afternoon streamed through the windows as I led her into the living room where my parents were waiting. “Inês, these are my mom and dad,” I said with a broad smile. They had always been so polite and carried themselves with such grace that, at first glance, I didn’t notice anything unusual. But I could see in Inês’s eyes that she sensed something I hadn’t picked up on—a certain air of mystery, a strange feeling that left her uneasy.

Throughout that day, as we talked and laughed, Inês seemed lost in thought. Later, she mentioned that, despite their friendliness, my parents exuded an almost enigmatic aura. I was surprised; to me, they were the very embodiment of kindness and simplicity. Perhaps my pride and my desire to show her the best side of my family had clouded my judgment.

A few weeks later, Inês and I decided to take a vacation to a distant country, choosing a beach with fine sand and an impressively blue sea. I wanted to enjoy the freedom and escape the routine for a while.

One afternoon, as I was walking alone along the beach, something inexplicable happened. On the other side of the dunes, I noticed a couple in the distance. At first, I thought it was just my imagination. But as I got closer, I began to notice details that left me stunned: that couple looked so much like my parents! The features, the gestures, even the way they walked… everything was almost identical. Only one thing was different: they looked younger and in better shape, as if time had frozen them.

On impulse, I softly called out, “Mom… Dad…” My voice was a mix of surprise and a hope I could barely control. When I realized that the couple had heard me, they turned toward me. In that brief exchange of glances, I felt a shiver run down my spine. Without a word, they began moving away quickly, as if they wanted to disappear as fast as possible.

I stood there, stunned and with my heart pounding erratically. Inês, who was with me, quickly came over and asked, worried, if everything was alright. I explained what had happened, but she thought it must have been my imagination playing tricks on me—maybe a result of being tired or the heat.

Yet, the feeling of strangeness lingered. To be sure I wasn’t seeing an illusion, I took my phone out and called my parents. On the other end of the line, their familiar, calm voices confirmed, “We’re at home, son. Everything is fine.” That confirmation only deepened the mystery. How could I have seen something so much like them, yet so different?

Now, as I write these lines, I’m trying to understand what really happened that day. Did I see a reflection of the past, or was it just my mind playing tricks on me? The couple I saw on the beach seemed like an idealized version of my parents, full of a youth and energy I had never seen in them. That experience changed me, making me realize that even the most familiar things might hide secrets.

I don’t know if I’ll ever uncover the truth, but that day left its mark on me. I now believe that behind the faces I love so much, there might be stories that don’t always fit what we expect. And so, amidst doubts and memories, I keep trying to piece together this enigma that turned a simple vacation into an experience that defied time and reality.
