I’m not in this story, but it’s one that’s stuck with me ever since I first heard it from my cousin. She swears it happened to a group of people she knew, friends of hers from an improv troupe who went on a weekend retreat together. I can’t vouch for how much of it is true, but the way she told it… well, let’s just say I’ve never been able to hear the words “Yes, and” the same way again.

\-

When Mara first began ‘teaching’ improv classes 6 years ago in her dorm common area, she never would have expected to end up here. 

An accounting major at first, then “undecided” for far too long, and now here, a struggling improv troupe leader. She was never really sure how she became the group leader, the whole idea had originated from YouTube and Saturday Night Live skits that she and her roommate (an insufferable theater major) had found funny. They thought that surely it couldn’t be too difficult for them to do something similar as a creative outlet for their otherwise very average college experience. 

The group started with the two of them, plus Mara’s boyfriend at the time, but gained traction quickly. Slowly, the rest of their friend groups wanted to join in on the fun, and within a year, they had an entire community-recognized ‘improv club’. 

They did open mic nights at smelly dive bars, created their own YouTube channel (with *very* mild success), and eventually even made small profits on their shows. Mara’s roommate originally led the group, using her theater experience to keep things moving, but after her abrupt departure 1 year ago, Mara was left with two choices. She could either let the group go their separate ways or she could step up to the plate and become the new leader. 

The group had been such a large part of her life for so long that she just couldn’t stomach letting it go without giving it another shot. And it wasn’t like she had anything better to do. Mara had been teaching Zumba classes at the local rec center to make ends meet between gigs, and the number of middle-aged white women attending her classes there was shrinking by the week. She couldn’t afford to *not* keep the group going. 

The first few months of running the improv group were fairly fun and easy to Mara, their bookings rolled in consistently and their social media stayed fairly active. But the last few months had been much more of an uphill battle. 

The group had found success in the first few years (and a few audience drinks) consistently selling out small theaters in the tri-state area. With ticket prices set at $15 per person it wasn’t too difficult to do. Their favorite show, Murder Mystery in the DMV, even went somewhat viral online 7 months ago. However, after the high of the viral show ended, the last six months had shown dismal ticket sales, less audience engagement, and even resulted in a 1-star review of the last venue they had performed at. 

Mara felt in her gut that something needed to change, and needed to change quickly, or else she was going to regret never finishing her accounting degree. 

Luckily for her, she had the perfect plan to reignite the group's spark, and it all started with Mara’s aunt's untimely car accident.  
  
Mara had never been particularly close to her aunt Marge. Ever since Mara was a child, Marge had lived outside of the city on a few acres of land with a somewhat dilapidated large house that sat right in the middle of the land. 

Marge would visit Mara and her family on birthdays, holidays, and when Mara’s grandparents had passed away. She never married or had children of her own. Marge had told everyone in their family that it was never in the cards for her, and they had all accepted that. 

So when Marge was struck and killed by a drunk driver 7 weeks ago, Mara had been surprised to learn that her somewhat estranged aunt had willed the estate to her. The paperwork had been settled, and now she held the keys to her aunt's stately 5-bedroom house. 

Mara had been once or twice as a child, but it was unfamiliar to her now as a somewhat grown-up. 

Mara got out of the small SUV they had rented to make the trip here. All but one of their group had agreed on carpooling. Mara had promised they would do no improv exercises until they arrived, much to the delight of the other passengers. 

Her no-frills tennis shoes crunched the gravel as she approached the rickety wooden porch. Car doors opened and closed behind her as the others got out, stretching their legs and grabbing bags from the vehicle.

“This place has... atmosphere. I’ll give you that.” Chris quipped from behind Mara, giving her a slight scare.

His description of the house was about as accurate as it could be. The house looked like it had sat sad and alone for a decade. Although it wasn’t crumbling, it seemed like it might start at any moment. 

Chris had been a part of the improv group for the last 2 years. Chris had also never intended to end up in this position; he was a *serious* actor, with Shakespearean stage roles under his belt (and a small stint as a dead body on a Law & Order spin-off). But after a few months of silence from his agent, he was forced to implement his backup plan. 

Starbucks. Starbucks had welcomed him with open arms, teaching him the ways of the barista quickly. He had loathed his early morning shifts and passing hot coffee to D-list actors who had taken over the roles that he was supposed to have. 

He had been scouring the internet for any auditions one night, really, any, when he saw a post that the improv group was looking to add a new member. Chris hadn’t seen any of their work, but with a pay of a few hundred dollars per gig and the possibility of exposure, it was something he couldn’t afford to pass up. 

Mara gave him a quick side eye glance. She never understood his need to wear so much jewelry, with such deep V-neck shirts. Chris was a great addition to their scenes, but off the stage, he was somewhat of a diva. Mara had a sneaking suspicion that she knew why his agent had ‘ghosted’ him. 

“Okay guys, let’s go over the rules and schedule one more time. Did everyone receive the email?” Mara asked.

There was a collective eye roll from the other members, but Dan's was the most exaggerated. 

Almost a year ago, during one of Dan’s many forgettable Tinder dates, a *very hot* woman (solid 10/10, no notes) had leaned across her drink and said, *"I just love a funny guy."* Naturally, Dan lied and said he performed improv. She made him prove it. He Googled the nearest group that night and showed up to the group's open workshop the next evening. He planned to say a few jokes, maybe snap a pic for Instagram/the hot woman, and ghost the scene entirely.

Instead, he received an invitation to join the group again. Somehow, despite his obvious sarcasm, Dan had the timing, the presence, and, according to Mara,  “an ironic detachment that makes you weirdly magnetic.”

So he stuck around. What started as a bit had become a weekly obligation… and, annoyingly, a kind of community. Plus, the small payday from gigs didn’t hurt him either.

Dan had a solid day job working in IT for a local finance company, so he didn’t need to rely on the gigs as heavily as other members of the group. That was something he often forgot when he wasn’t seriously rehearsing like the others. 

Sometimes he had a hard time shaking off the corporate aesthetic he was forced to put on at work. In his bag all he had were more collared shirts.

Now here he was, using his Paid Time Off,  trapped on an ‘improv retreat’ with these people. 

“Mara, you know wifi is dangerous to the human body and that I don’t condone internet usage.. Can you give me a handwritten copy?” Said Lila from where she was standing next to Dan.

At least Lila was kind of hot, even if she did smell a little weird sometimes, he thought.

Unlike Dan, Lila wasn’t invited to join the improv group.

She just kind of… showed up.

About three years ago, the group was running a barely attended show in the back room of a vegan bakery-slash-crystal-emporium called **“**Chakra Cake**.”** Right as the lights went down, Lila walked in, barefoot and radiant, carrying a handmade kombucha bottle and smelling somewhat strongly of patchouli. She took a seat in the front row and laughed at everything — even the weird bits that didn’t land.

After the show, she approached the group and said:

*“You all have such open auras. I dreamed about this exact scene three nights ago. I think I’m supposed to be part of this.”*

Mara’s roommate, still high on the adrenaline of the one person who clapped during the blackout scene, said yes.

No one could explain how it happened, but Lila just kept showing up. Rehearsals, shows, meetings. She never asked for permission. She never did any of the venue work like hauling equipment in and out of the building. But she brought tea, tarot cards, and unexpectedly brilliant character work when the moment called for it.

According to Lila, improv is a sacred energy exchange and she’s been "channeling archetypes" since childhood. No one knows where she lives. She sometimes leaves rehearsal early to “help a birth” or “clear the energy of an office building.”

But, she's never missed a show, and here she was on the retreat with the rest of them.

Just as Mara was about to go over the retreat schedule for the third time, holding up Lila’s printed itinerary like a flight attendant, the gravel driveway crunched with the sound of tires.

Everyone turned.

A small, beat-up sedan crept up the long, tree-lined drive, one headlight out, the engine making a sound. The car looked like it had been salvaged from the set of a student horror film. The group watched as it rolled to a slow stop near the others’ van.

Out stepped Natalie. 

Mara took notice that Natalie was about 4 minutes late, according to the schedule. If she had ridden with the rest of them in the SUV, this wouldn’t have been a problem, Mara thought.

Natalie didn’t say anything at first. Just stood beside her car, one hand still on the door, eyes scanning the house.

Lila tilted her head. “Mmm. Heavy energy.”

Natalie finally looked at them. “I got a little lost. My GPS started rerouting me in circles like five miles back. Kept saying I’d arrived, but there was nothing there.”

Dan gave a mock shiver. “Cool. Ghost road.”

Natalie cracked a very slight smile. “Maybe.”

Mara forced a friendly wave. “Glad you made it!”

Natalie reached into the passenger seat, grabbed a leather-bound notebook and a battered duffel, and joined the group on the front steps without another word.

No one was quite sure how Natalie had ended up in the group. She’d shown up to an improv workshop in February, hadn’t spoken for the first forty minutes, then stepped into a warm-up exercise and delivered a monologue so raw and chilling that it left the group in stunned silence. No one clapped. No one laughed. Chris looked personally offended.

Since then, she’d come to every rehearsal. Always early. Always watching. She didn’t do bits. She rarely played games. But when she performed, it was like something else was in the room.

Mara never officially invited her. She never asked to join. But when they booked the retreat, Natalie was already on the email thread. No one had the guts to remove her.

“Now that we’re all here, can I continue with the ground rules and schedule review?” Mara asked, very mildly annoyed.

“Of course, Mara, it’s not like you’ve already gone over it multiple times and asked for our opinions on it multiple times already.” Chris replied, his necklaces lightly tinkling as he moved with his words. 

Everything Chris said was dramatic. Chris did nothing subtly.

Dan shot him a look. Mara ignored them.

“Okay crew, if we want to get back into the groove of our group and recreate the successes we’ve previously had, we have to all agree that we will follow the rules and the schedule of our retreat. Understood?” Mara asked the group.

Natalie gave a slight nod (she wasn’t sure what successes Mara was referring to). 

“So the ground rules are as follows, and if you ever forget them, please refer to your emails.” Lila raised her hand at this, but Mara ignored her and continued.

“Rule number 1: Stay in character! This retreat is a fully immersive experience at all times. Meals, chores, bathroom breaks, all in character. The whole thing is a scene. Rule number 2: Yes and everything! No blocking ideas, no denying new directions, no saying something is dumb.” Mara gave Chris a look, but he ignored her.

“Rule number 3:  The safe word is pineapple! Although I don’t want us to have to use it, if anything gets too real, too personal, or too anything, use the safe word pineapple to get out of it.

Rule number 4: Respect the space! This is my aunt’s old home. It’s an antique, and there are antiques inside it. Try not to break anything or get too nosy, even I don’t know what’s in there.” Mara said.

**“**That’s smart.**”** Natalie cut in, her voice quiet but serious. 

Everyone turned to look at her.

She shrugged.**“**Old houses are like… emotional sponges. Bad stuff sticks around. You don’t want to wake it up**.”**

Chris raised an eyebrow. “Are you saying this place has, like, emotional mold?”

Natalie shrugged in response, and Lila nodded her head in a ‘yes’ motion. It was Mara’s turn to roll her eyes.

“Rule number 5: No phones, no wifi, no distractions! Phones will be left in the car; I have the keys to the car. If you must make a phone call, please do so at least 10 feet away from Lila and the house. We must unplug in order to reconnect.” Mara finished the rules, feeling satisfied with her closing sentence. 

Chris interrupted her moment of peace.

“No phones? What if my agent calls while we’re here?” He asked.

“Chris, you haven’t had an agent in at least a year.” Mara replied flatly.

Dan snorted at Mara’s response, and Chris resigned himself. 

“Everyone got it?” She asked; she desperately needed the group to follow the rules and the structure that she was trying to create. 

Mara was a firm believer that true creativity comes from strict structure.

“Got it, thanks for organizing all of this, Mara. It’ll be nice to unplug for a little while.” Chris said, taking a final check of his work Slack channel before setting his status to ‘Offline’. 

“Yes, thank you, Mara! I can feel the renewed group energy already.. Or has someone forgotten to turn off their wifi?” Lila asked.

No one responded. They were used to Lila’s ‘quirks’. The group was busy turning off their phones, gathering themselves and their personal items, and walking up the old porch steps to the front door. 

The house was big. Bigger than any of them expected.

Not in a modern, open-concept kind of way, more like it had been slowly added onto over time, by someone who never quite cared if one hallway connected cleanly to the next. Still, it had enough bedrooms for everyone to have their own, and that alone made this retreat feel borderline luxurious. They’d done gigs where all five of them crammed into one double-bed motel room, taking turns sleeping on yoga mats and using their coats as blankets. No one was eager to go back to that era.

The decor was... difficult to describe. Sparse, but in an unsettlingly intentional way. The rooms that *were* decorated felt like time capsules from several decades ago — but not in a charming, curated thrift-store kind of way. In a *bordering-on-haunted* kind of way.

Too many mirrors, all slightly different shapes. Faded velvet drapes. A taxidermied peacock in the hallway that seemed to be staring directly at the bathroom. The air smelled faintly like mothballs and rosemary.

Mara hadn’t changed anything since inheriting it. Honestly, she hadn’t known where to start.

Her aunt Marge had never been a fan of HGTV. Or electricity. Or people, really.

Most of the house still ran on half-functioning light switches and ancient pull-chain lamps. The upstairs hallways creaked no matter how lightly you stepped, and some of the doorways had visible grooves in the wood where the doors had been opened and closed hundreds of times over decades.

While everyone claimed their rooms (Chris went straight for the master), Natalie wandered through the halls. She didn’t mind the dust on most surfaces, and preferred to see the entire place before she got too settled in. 

One of the rooms had a slightly ajar door. Natalie peaked through the open crack and saw a wall lined with books. She nudged the door and it creaked open a bit more. After a short pause the door opened the rest of the way on its own, groaning the entire time.

She didn’t think this would be considered too nosey, especially if the door was basically opening itself, so she took a step inside. 

The entire room was wood panelled, and the wood matched the floor perfectly. Besides the wall of books, the room contained a large wooden desk with a faded leather chair behind it. In the middle of the room was a lounge setup. A couch and small velvet chair centered around a wooden coffee table. 

There was a creak and Natalie turned quickly back to the door. It was only Mara. 

Mara entered the room slowly, looking around. 

“My aunt never let me play in this room when I was little." She said quietly.

Natalie paused in front of one of the bookcases — the only piece of furniture that looked well-used. It was built into the wall and packed with old volumes, almost none with titles on the spine. She ran a finger down the side of one book and pulled it out. The leather cover creaked like an old joint.

“Hey Mara,” she said, holding it up. “Was your aunt into theater?”

Mara glanced at the book.

The cover read: *The Art of Ritual and Stage Presence: Invoking Emotion and Memory Through Performance.*

“No,” Mara said slowly. “She wasn’t really into… anything.”

Natalie flipped through it. The pages were dense and yellowed.

“Feels like something Lila would sleep with under her pillow,” she said jokingly, handing it off to Mara as Dan entered the room.

Dan took a look at the book and raised an eyebrow. 

“Yeah, this definitely looks cursed.” He said with a light chuckle.

He mimed being sucked into the book, then set it down on the coffee table in the center of the room.

Everyone laughed. The moment passed.

But later that night, the book was still sitting out on the coffee table.

Open.

After the group members got settled in, they slowly reconvened in the kitchen of the old house. 

Mara was putting away the groceries she had brought for the trip, basics like eggs, bread, sandwich fixings, various snacks, and ingredients for a vegan spaghetti (Lila’s suggestion). 

Dan’s contribution to the kitchen was a case of PBR. He liked PBR in the semi-pretentious, non-ironic kind of way that so-called ‘hipsters’ do these days.

Chris’s was similar. He had brought a single bottle of expensive whiskey. It was definitely out of his budget, but he couldn’t bear the thought of showing up empty-handed, or with an averagely priced gift. 

As the three of them put their items in their respective places, Lila lit a small bundle of sage.

“Do you have to do that every time we go somewhere new?” Chris said, pinching his nose.

“It’s always good to cleanse the space, so there’s room for new energies like ours.” She replied, not at all deterred by him. 

Dan had moved to the window that looked into the expansive backyard. He wanted to get away from the sage smoke.

“Hey guys, it looks like there’s a fire pit in the yard. With a big fire like that, Lila, we won’t even need the sage.” He said, pointing out the window.

The rest of them in the kitchen took a look out the window. There was indeed a good-sized fire pit outside the back door. Behind and around the fire pit was nothing but trees and natural landscape. 

“I didn’t even know that was out there..” Mara said, shrugging.

She headed out the back door, hands full of chips and crackers, Dan following behind with an opened can of PBR and a small stack of paper cups. Lila continued saging the kitchen. Chris let out an exasperated sigh before snatching up his whiskey bottle and following the other two out the back door. 

Natalie entered the kitchen just in time to see the small group depart. 

Lila smudged with her sage mostly in silence, occasionally humming something very quietly to herself. 

Natalie opened the fridge, looked around, cautiously grabbed a PBR from the shelf, and then shut the fridge door.

“You coming out to this fire thing?” she asked, leaning on the counter.

Lila paused, waving the last curl of smoke toward the ceiling.“Just about done. Mara wants everyone together, right?”

“Yeah,” Natalie said, opening her drink.  “She’s already doing the thing where she pretends it’s not mandatory, but it totally is.”

“She gets twitchy when we free-range.” Lila said, grinning.

Natalie smirked, already heading for the door. “Better come before she starts assigning fire circle roles.”

“I’m right behind you,” Lila said, giving the sage bundle one last little flick before snuffing it in the sink.

The sun had gone down for the evening, which made the fire they had started in the backyard seem even larger than it was, flaring up between them as they sat in a circle around it.

There were a few empty PBR cans around the fire, and a smattering of paper cups that may or may not have held the aforementioned expensive whiskey. Lila brought her own mug out, and was drinking something murky and questionable from it.

“Alright, let’s do a new game here.” Dan said, holding up his beer.

Since no one was allowed to object (per Mara’s rules) no one did.

“Let’s do ‘Yes and..’ but...drunk!” Mara said with a little giggle. 

She was always a little more free after a few drinks. 

“I’ll start!” Dan volunteered.

“I can’t believe you brought a goat to our wedding!” He said dramatically.

Chris immediately picked it up.“Yes and, I accidentally put your wife’s veil on it!” Chris said, proud of himself.

Lila jumped in.

“Yes and, I believe it’s legally your officiant now!” 

Natalie joined in, quietly, but with purpose.

“Yes and, that goat is my uncle, and we’re very proud of his accomplishments!”

That got a laugh out of everyone. 

They continued playing ‘Yes and’ for a few more rounds, each one getting more and more absurd. At one point, Mara had a thought to herself that this was exactly what the retreat was supposed to be about, reconnecting the group and finding their spark again. 

While playing this game, she felt like they were doing just that. 

“Yes and, I need to use the ladies' room.” Chris said, standing and swaying slightly in front of the fire.

“Yes and, go you old man.” Dan replied. 

With that Chris started his easy walk back to the house. It was lit up by firelight that danced over its rough edges, making it seem like the house itself was moving. 

That was disorienting to Chris, who had already had a few paper cups full of whiskey at this point. 

With little grace, he made it inside the house. The rooms were now dark, lit only by fire and moonlight that was coming in through the windows.

He made his way down the main hall in search of the bathroom he knew was on this floor. The hall was dark, darker than most of the house, since all of the doors to the rooms were tightly shut. 

Chris reached the bathroom, going in to do his business, not even bothering to turn on the light. 

He washed his hands in the dark, then re-entered the hallway. Something had changed. 

A door on his right had drifted slightly ajar, letting the tiniest bit of light out into the hallway. As he went to pass it, he took a quick look inside. 

Inside the cracked door were books, many books. Some of them appeared to be almost glowing in the light from the window. 

Something caught his eye. There, on the table. A book lay open, moon and fire light playing on its pages. 

Chris pushed the door open and stepped inside to take a look at the book. 

“Theater Rituals for the Devoted Stage..” He read quietly to himself. 

“Hmm.. this could be interesting.” He said as he picked the book up and began to make his way back outside to the rest of the group. 

“Yes and, took you long enough, Chris!” Lila shouted as Chris reapproached the fire. 

“What is that?” Mara said, pointing to the book under Chris’s arm. 

“Drink Mara! You broke character! You have to drink!” Dan said excitedly, pointing at Mara. 

Mara gave a small sigh and took a short sip of the cup of whiskey Chris had poured her when they first started the fire. She grimaced. Just because it was ‘expensive’, as Chris had stated, didn’t mean it was good. 

“Theater Rituals for the Devoted Stage!” Chris proclaimed loudly, holding the open book out in front of him like a script. 

“Oooh, I love a good ritual!” Lila said, clapping her hands together excitedly. 

“Where did you get that from?” Mara said, attempting to interrupt him, but Chris had already started. 

“It even has blocking notes! It’s a perfect monologue.” He said, clearing his throat. 

Chris stood up taller, puffed his chest out, and began reading with the Shakespearean approach he had perfected during his time at Starbucks. 

“To the Sacred Order of players, who speak truth through lies and give breath to the dead with their words, gather now beneath flame and sky. Let none wear masks who fears the face beneath.” 

“Okay, weirdly spooky start..” Natalie said as Chris took a breath between words.

“We call now on the Echo Beyond: keeper of forgotten lines, patron of vanished voices. Enter this circle and bestow us with the gift of divine spontaneity. May we channel the chaos, embrace the unknown, and offer up the selves we do not yet know.” Chris continued, never dropping his dramatic tone.

“Really, though, what is this and where did it come from?” Mara said, brows furrowed as she tried to remember more about her aunt Marge and why a book like this would be in her house. 

Chris ignored her questions, never looking away from his script. 

Natalie noticed that his tone had changed slightly. What began as almost a mocking tone had turned very serious, very quickly. 

They all had come to know Chris as an ‘over-actor’, a term for those who were desperate to have the *it* factor, but unfortunately did not. So Natalie did not find his approach very surprising. 

“We are vessels. Let the spirit of the stage enter us. Through laughter, through terror, through revelation. 

Take our fear, take our pride, take our names.” His body had tensed up during this moment in his monologue. 

Everyone sat in silence. This was one of Chris’s best performances to date. 

Too bad there were no ticket sales for this one, Mara thought to herself.

“We are ready.” Chris finished his performance, let out a large sigh, and visibly deflated.

At the same moment, a cold gust of wind came through the fields around them, rushing over the fire. In response, the fire cracked loudly. A single flame shot high into the sky. 

Mara yelped.

“Thanks, Chris, I think that’s enough of that for one night.” She said quickly. 

Chris didn’t respond. His gaze was firmly planted on the fire. Mara could see the reflection of the flames in his unblinking eyes. 

“Are you good?” Natalie asked, standing to lightly touch Chris on the shoulder. 

He jumped at her touch, eyes refocusing on the group. 

“Yeah, sorry, was just doing a bit..” He said unconvincingly.

“Rituals like that can take their toll on a person.” Lila said, sipping from her mug, seemingly undisturbed by the events that had just taken place. 

“Okay, but that wasn’t a ‘ritual’, it was just a monologue, right? It was just a bit?” Dan said in a tone that wanted to be factual, but instead came out more like questioning. 

“Yeah. Just a bit.” Chris said as he took his seat next to Natalie. 

“Alright, new rule.” Mara cut in.

“No more monologues from weird books that we find in the house. Also, just a reminder, that part of rule 4 was ‘no snooping’.” Mara said, glancing at each of them around the fire. 

She needed to maintain the integrity of the retreat's structure, and Chris’ monologue had come dangerously close to throwing it off.

“Sorry, Mara, that looks like the book that we found in your aunt's office earlier.” Natalie said, not wanting to upset Mara any further. 

“Yes, we promise to obey rule 4 and the new rule from here on out!” Dan said, eager to move away from this experience. 

Above them, the wind died down. The fire resettled itself even smaller than it had been originally. The house and the land became very, very quiet.

I'll write out more of what I know of the story if people are interested, it gets even crazier but I didn't have time to get to the next part.
