The water was clear enough that we could see the reef from the surface, a wavering garden of color thirty feet below. It was almost beautiful enough to make me forget the weirdness of the island.

We slipped in one by one, the cool slap of seawater filling the spaces in our wetsuits before settling into that slow, rhythmic press only divers know. Air hissed from our regulators and sunlight poured down in ribbons that wavered with the swell above.

Julian’s voice crackled over the comms in my mask.
“Alright, everyone keep an eye out for your long lost mermaid girlfriend.”

Mara laughed. “If she shows up, you can have her. I’m holding out for a merman with a yacht.”

Thomas’s voice came in low and lazy. “Just remember what the old ladies said—if they smile, it’s already too late.”

“Yeah,” Julian said, “I’ll make sure to be rude and scowl at them right back.”

My smart ass felt the need to drop some humor of my own into the mix "We might be getting paid to find this drone but if I get to clap some Mermaid cheeks in the meantime, I'll just consider that a bonus!" 

We all laughed and proceeded to descend slowly, equalizing our ears, drifting past parrotfish that nibbled at coral with the sound of distant static. A green sea turtle cruised past us without hurry.

“Tell me again why anyone’s afraid of this place,” Mara said. “This is like a damn travel brochure.”

“Superstitions,” Thomas said. “They live on an island that’s thirty years behind the rest of the world. Probably tell ghost stories for fun.”

“I’m just saying,” Julian cut in, “if I see my mom down here in a seashell bra, I’m swimming straight into a shark’s mouth.”

I couldn't help myself as I took the opening to bust his balls. "If I see your mom down here in a seashell bra, you might end up with a new step daddy." Julian couldn't help but break and laugh but before he could respond with a line of his own, we reached the lip of the reef wall, peering over into the blue drop-off. The colors shifted from bright corals to deeper shades—purples, rusty reds, pale blues. A small school of yellow tang darted past like a gust of sunshine.

“There’s the drone,” Thomas said, pointing. Sure enough, it was lodged against a coral head, its casing dented but intact.

We moved toward it at an easy pace. A curious grouper followed along behind Julian, its thick lips opening and closing as if it were part of the conversation.
Mara floated upside-down to peer under the drone. “Maybe it just didn’t want to be found. Little undersea rebellion.”

“Good thing machines don’t get lonely but if they did, maybe Julians mom could shake them seashells and keep it company” Thomas said with a shit eating grin plastered all over my face. Julian again laughed before letting out a "fuck you, bro!" We all laughed hysterically together before moving on and continuing our expedition.

We took our time inspecting the coral nearby, careful not to brush against it. There were sea anemones with clownfish darting between their tentacles, the faint shadow of a stingray gliding over the sand far below and the glittering scales of wrasse flickering through beams of light.

Thomas began working the drone free, muttering into the comm about “the world’s most expensive paperweight.”

Julian hovered nearby, fiddling with his GoPro. “Kanoa would lose his mind if he saw us down here just sightseeing.”

Mara’s laugh came warm through the static. “If we bring him a seashell, maybe he’ll chill out.”

That’s when I noticed the quiet.

It wasn’t sudden but it was like I had just became aware of it all at once. The constant background clicks, the muffled scrape of parrotfish, even the faint surge of water moving over the reef were all gone.

Only our breathing remained and underneath it was something else.

Faint, far away, not sound exactly but more like a thought that didn’t belong to me.

A melody, slow and curling, each note pulling at the edge of recognition.

I looked up to see Julian’s head turn as if he’d heard it too. Mara was still smiling behind her mask but her eyes had gone distant.

Thomas froze mid-motion, the drone still in his hands.

None of us spoke.

The song kept winding through my head, soft as a whisper in a dream. Familiar, inviting, and impossibly far away.
