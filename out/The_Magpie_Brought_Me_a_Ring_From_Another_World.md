I was friends with a magpie once.  
 It began when I found an injured bird on my porch. I think it had flown into my window at high speed, bounced off, and then just lay there.  
 I fed it worms that I dug up from the lawn. During the first few days, it had no strength to drink or eat by itself. I dropped water from a teaspoon into its open beak and tempted it with worms.

Weeks went by. The magpie perked up, began stepping around on the porch, and fluttered off a little to try its wings. Eventually, the day came when it flew away.  
 It returned the very next day. This time, it had a small gift with it. The magpie placed a beautiful maple leaf on the windowsill. It’s the thought that counts, so I thanked it with a homemade meatball. The magpie appreciated the meatball and came back the very next day with another leaf.

It became a little tradition just between the magpie and me. Every day the magpie brought me a small gift in its beak, and I thanked it with a small treat from the kitchen. The magpie gave me both small stones, pinecones, and berries.  
 One day, the magpie landed on my hand as usual. In its beak, it carried a gold ring. Magpies love things that shine. I thought it had stolen it from some neighbor who had left it unattended.

The magpie dropped the ring into my hand. It was a plain gold ring. I looked inside to see if it had an inscription.  
 “Cecily and Frank 27-15-23,” it said inside the ring.  
 That was strange—last I checked, the year still had only 12 months. I took out a magnifying glass and checked again. It really did say 27-15.  
 “Where did you get this from?” I asked the magpie.  
 The magpie tilted its head and fluttered its wings absentmindedly. No help there.

I thoughtfully placed the ring in my wallet. I didn’t know any Cecily and I didn’t know any Frank. But my mother had once told me that Cecily was one of her favorite names. In another life, I might have been named Cecily. The magpie flew to the fence and waited there. I went into the kitchen and fetched a piece of ham. The magpie appreciated its gift and flew off with the ham in its beak.

The next day, I received another gift from the magpie. This time it was a small hazelnut. But when I looked more closely at the nut, I saw a strange symmetrical pattern covering its entire surface. The pattern resembled a mandala.  
 I dismissed it as a quirk of nature and rewarded the magpie with a meatball. The magpie remained perched on my hand and ate up the meatball. It seemed tired, as if it had flown a very long way.

The following day, the magpie didn’t show up. It didn’t come back. That had never happened before.  
 The next day I was truly worried. I paced back and forth, searching for the magpie.  
 The sun had set, and the stars were beginning to appear in the sky.  
 I sat on the porch under a blanket and waited. I waited so long that I dozed off.

When I woke up, it was dark, but the full moon lit up the porch.  
 The magpie sat on the armrest with a leaf in its beak.  
 I carefully took the leaf from the magpie’s beak. It looked exhausted. I gave it a piece of dried meat that I had in my pocket.  
 The leaf was heart-shaped, like a linden leaf. There was something written on it. I held it up in the moonlight and read:  
 “I am here, where are you? Frank.”
