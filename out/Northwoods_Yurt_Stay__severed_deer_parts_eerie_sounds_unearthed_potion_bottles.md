Almost a year ago, December 2024, my partner and I decided to spend a weekend in a yurt in western central Minnesota near Sandstone for her birthday. We chose this location because a "hot tub" was included as an amenity (little did we know it was a claw foot tub with a campfire beneath). 

We drove up from Chicago and made our usual small-town grocery run before descending on our spot. The road to the yurt was primitive, winding, not easily located on a map and remote. As soon as we arrived we noticed a cabin where the owners usually stayed (they were out at the time) and a couple yurts. We were alone and the air was cold and dry. We breathed in and out, relishing the solitude away from the noise of the city. At this time a truck pulls up in the muddy roundabout, slows down, stops for a moment and quickly pulls away. Not the owners.

Since we arrived we'd been hearing shotguns firing in the background and shrugged it off as hunters in the area (this was the Northwoods, after all). We made ourselves at home in the yurt, cracked a couple beers and decided to explore. 

We walked towards the cabin and followed a trail to the nearby frozen lake. We noticed something hanging from the trees and as we approached we found severed deer parts dangling in the air. Legs and torso with bloody cartilage, veins and all. We looked down and saw the deer head staring straight at us, tongue hanging from its mouth, sitting atop a wood shed looking in the direction of our yurt. My partner, a vegetarian and animal lover, looked away horrified. We looked at each other, heard more gun shots and made some sense of it (Northwoods).

We texted the owners, it took them a while to respond. They assured us it was their backwoods neighbors ("every country home has em, I suppose"). We felt reassured, but nevertheless a bit uncomfortable, unfamiliar and isolated. We were still the only folks on the whole property. We returned to the yurt, drank some whiskey, warmed up and went to bed exhausted. The yurt had no lock, but folks are friendly up here.. right?

The next day we woke up, felt refreshed and ready to have a birthday hike around the property. We made breakfast and ran out of the stocked firewood. Back to the old woodshed. As I walked I saw the deer head in the distance pointed in my direction awaiting my inevitable return. I grabbed the wood making an effort not to make eyes with the ill-fatal animal and quickly headed back. An interesting start to the day. 

We milled about for a bit and I scrambled down a hillside to the edge of the frozen lake. I came upon a pile of old rusted tins including a pop-top beer can, a Folger's coffee tin from the 1950s and various little bottles of different colors. As a person who studied history these were all archeological findings to me and I spent the better part of the afternoon unearthing these things. I tossed them up to our site and we dusted them off and displayed them on our picnic table.

We moved on and down the road to some open public lands. I brought the whiskey with me and we took turns swigging the bottle. We literally stumbled upon an old car door, what looked like from an old pre-60s white truck, embedded in the ground. I asked my partner to take a photo of me with it and at that point my phone died for the remainder of the weekend. 

All of these findings from that afternoon started to appear strange, like someone quickly packed up and left the property for good over 60 years prior. I realized perhaps I was meddling with some bad juju and moved on. That feeling lasted on the walk back to camp.

Our night proceeded as usual. The wind was picking up and the cold was blowing hard. We made a hot fire that lasted until we fell fast asleep. 

I woke up freezing, the fire died and the potbelly stove needed to be filled and stoked back to life. But it wasn't the cold that woke me. It sounded like something was encircling us, moving in closer and closer. I woke up my partner and she asked "is there another guest looking for their yurt?". It had to be 3 or 4 in the morning, my phone dead so I didn't know. 

Along came more noises, it sounded like a 3 gallon bucket just rolling and rolling, whirring louder and louder. This made some sense since we had used a bucket to fill the "hot tub" earlier. But it was incessant and grew louder along with the footsteps. It made no sense because the clearing in the woods couldn't have been more than 15 feet wide by 30 feet long and a bucket couldn't roll that freely. Unexplainable. We stuck a broomstick in the door handle to keep the door locked and kept our hatchet next to the bed. 

My eyes were wide for what felt like forever. I must've managed to fall asleep at some point because I woke up to daylight and I never felt so relieved. I looked outside and there was the 3 gallon bucket sitting upright where we had left it, nothing touched or moved from the night before.

These were some of the creepiest woods I have encountered. There's something about that part of the country in the cold, dead of winter that makes you feel a little alone and empty, but like someone or something is always watching. I left the archeological findings behind, naturally.
