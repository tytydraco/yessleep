A good couple of years ago, right about when the world seemed to be reemerging from what seemed at the time an endless thoroughfare of liminality, I was called south for a brief business trip in New Orleans. Most coworkers had jointly planned to stay in one of the high rising, unoffensively comfortable chain hotels in the downtown area, a notion that was absurd to me given the incomparable atmosphere of the colorfully cobbled inns of the historical French quarter down below. So I abandoned the comfort of camaraderie (not a huge loss considering my affection for my co-workers ran slim) in favor of a lonesome, atmospheric jaunt through the dim quarter on the night before our meeting.



I checked into my charming southern hotel, and after a delicious dinner of gumbo and a stroll down the darkening Mississippi, I figured what better way to end my night than by a good old New Orleans ghost tour. I did not believe in these tidbits of fascinating folklore of course, but the history and imagination of it all was irresistible to me. A one armed Iraq war veteran led the way through the quarter at night, narrating with both an amphetaminic excitement and dire pallor. He told of the mischievous spooks of the Andrew Jackson Hotel and the atrocities of the Lalaurie mansion, but my ears really perked up when we came to my own hotel. He began by describing it in its initial state, a civil war hospital, about as grim a bedrock for a horror story as you can get. He, however, stopped there and continued on to the next notable haunt on his itinerary. After the tour I asked him why he went no further with my hotel. He told me blank and wide eyed that the hotel had formally pressured the company organizing the tours to tread lightly in revealing its dark secrets, as it apparently correlated with a stark decline in incoming guests. 



Interesting to be sure, I thought cockily, showing my disappointment at the lack of gruesome details to this poor, wacked out, likely deeply traumatized guy. I strode back to my hotel with confidence. However, once entering its musty interiors, I was struck by a sense of unease. My journey up to the room was met by the gnawing feeling that I would run into some ghastly, hacked up soldier at every corner, if that was even the worst thing that this hotel had to offer. Even once safely in the room, the fear continued to grow, so I resolved to just leave the lights on through the night and put simpsons reruns on the tv to lull me into an unlikely sleep. Ghosts don’t haunt brightly lit rooms blaring 90s cartoons, right?



I don’t remember falling asleep that night but I will never forget waking up, in what reason suggests it was that hotel room, but my senses betrayed to me as a black void in which light has never graced. Even the supposed bed I lie in felt less like a bed, more like a stiff board of oak. I felt an odd ache throughout my body that I could never determine as real or illusory. An urgent wakefulness came to me and I glanced around like a madman, hoping to God that this darkness would end. Unfortunately it did.



Eventually, a small glow came from a spot in the distance that seemed many yards away, It approached, closer and closer. As it did, it registered to me a sort of this rocky, orange orb, both dim and bright at the same time. Closer closer until I was face to face with it. There was a strange comfort I felt with this glow, as if it were some neutral cosmic entity that meant no harm. 



This meditative hypnosis was broken by a snort of smoke released around the orb, which smelled of sour tobacco. The orb suddenly lit up brightly with a hellish glare, revealing a large, absolutely terrible man leaning over my bed, directly in my face. The orb was merely the ashy end of a stubby, shit like cigar, insignificantly sticking out of a head, that horrible, giant godless dome with an infinitely rotting beard. 



Darting my glance away from this life-ruining sight was not much better, as this enormous brute wore a dusty apron stinking with visible blotches of blood, whose blood I could not say. In the aprons pockets were a slew of esoteric tools that I could not identify, either in name or purpose. What he held in his hands was more obvious; a butcher knife. The smell of tobacco would have been welcome relief to what was now an atmosphere of an ill maintained slaughterhouse filling my nostrils.



I decided this was quite enough so, shutting my eyes first thing to avoid any more sights enough to ruin a man for ten lifetimes over, stumbled over objects I couldn't place to where I knew the door was, crashing through, into the hall, down the stairs, and out to the street where I still did not stop.



I ran out of the quarter into the still bustling downtown area, into the Marriott, up to the room where thank God I knew one of my coworkers was staying, He let me in and I made up a fairly realistic story of travel mishaps to explain why I lacked both room and luggage, my tired coworker nodding yawningly without much analysis.



I spent the meeting next day staring, staring at nothing in particular. When offered by coworkers to get drinks on bourbon street afterward I respectfully declined, choosing to head straight for the airport to spend half a day staring down the runway, the benign cement giving me a slight comfort of nothingness in this mood of absolute dread. 



I have not been to New Orleans since and only stay in high rising, unoffensively comfortable chain hotels in downtown areas from now on.
