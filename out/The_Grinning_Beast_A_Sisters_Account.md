I wasn’t expecting to hear from Sarah. We hadn’t talked much in the last few months—not because we were fighting or anything, just life getting in the way. She’d moved into that house a while back, and I figured she was busy settling in. When I saw her name pop up on my missed calls list, I thought it was just one of her usual check-ins.  

But when I listened to the voicemail, something about her tone unsettled me.  

**Day 1: The First Voicemail**
*"Hey, Em! It’s me. Just wanted to call and catch up—I know it’s been a while. Anyway, something weird happened last night. I woke up around 2 AM because I heard this scratching noise on my window. When I checked, there were these claw marks on the glass! Like, actual scratches. I thought maybe it was raccoons or something, but… I don’t know. It didn’t look like anything an animal would do."*  

*"Oh, and get this—when I looked outside, I swear I saw someone standing by the tree line. Just this tall figure, kind of hunched over? But when I turned on the porch light, they were gone. Probably just my imagination, right? Anyway, call me back when you get this. Love you!"*  

At first, I laughed a little under my breath—Sarah always had a flair for the dramatic. She could turn a creaky floorboard into a ghost story if you let her. But as I replayed the message, something about it didn’t sit right with me. She didn’t sound scared exactly, but there was an edge to her voice—a nervousness she was trying to hide.  

I called her back that evening after work but got no answer. That wasn’t unusual for Sarah; she’d always been terrible at keeping her phone nearby. Still, I made a mental note to try again the next day.


The second voicemail came late that night—around 11:30 PM. Her voice was different this time: nervous but still trying to sound rational.


**Day 2: The Second Voicemail**  
*"Hey, Em. So… remember how I told you about those claw marks? Well, it happened again last night. Same time—around 2 AM—but this time, the scratches were on my *bedroom window*. And… okay, this is going to sound crazy, but I saw that figure again. It was closer this time—standing right outside the fence. I couldn’t see its face or anything, but it was tall… like *really* tall. And its arms were way too long for its body."*  

*"I’m probably just freaking myself out over nothing. Maybe it’s some weirdo messing with me? Anyway, just wanted to let you know in case… well, in case something happens. Call me back when you can."*  

Her words sent a chill down my spine. What did she mean by “in case something happens”? That wasn’t like Sarah at all—she wasn’t one to jump to conclusions or let her imagination run wild.  

I called her back immediately after hearing the message but got no response again. This time, though, it bothered me more than it should have.


The next voicemail came in at 3 AM—a frantic call that jolted me awake when my phone buzzed on my nightstand.


**Day 3: The Third Voicemail**
*"Emily! Oh my God, please call me back as soon as you get this! It was outside my house tonight—*right outside*! I was in bed when I heard scratching at the front door. At first, I thought it was the wind or something, but then it started knocking. Not like a person knocking—it was slow and uneven, like claws tapping against the wood."*  

*"I didn’t open it—I swear I didn’t—but when I looked through the peephole… it was there. Just standing there on the porch with this huge grin on its face. Its teeth were so sharp… and its eyes… oh God, its eyes were completely black. It just stood there staring at me for what felt like hours before it walked away."*  

*"I don’t know what to do! Please call me back!"*  

Hearing her describe that thing made my stomach turn over itself. A grin? Black eyes? What kind of person—or thing—was she describing? My first instinct was to drive out to her house immediately and check on her myself… but something stopped me: fear.

What if whatever she saw was still there?

  
The next voicemail came in at 3 AM again—the same time as before—and this one chilled me to my core.


**Day 4: The Fourth Voicemail**
*"Emily! It’s inside the house! Oh God… oh God… how did it get in? I locked all the doors and windows—I swear I did—but when I woke up tonight, it was standing at the foot of my bed."*  

*"It didn’t move—it just stood there grinning at me with that horrible smile. And then it whispered my name… in *your voice*. How does it know your voice?! It kept saying things like ‘Come with me’ and ‘You’re next.’"*  

*"I don’t know what to do anymore—I can’t sleep; I can’t eat; it’s always watching me! Please help me!"*  

Her voice cracked halfway through the message like she was barely holding herself together—and honestly? Neither was I.

How could something *inside her house* know *my voice*? Was she hallucinating? Losing her mind? Or worse—was everything she said real?


This voicemail broke me.


 **Day 5: The Fifth Voicemail**
*"Hi, Em. It’s me again… but you probably already knew that."*  

*"I think I understand now what it wants. It’s not trying to hurt me—it’s trying to *replace me*. Every time I look in the mirror now, my reflection doesn’t match what I’m doing. Sometimes it smiles when I’m not smiling… or moves when I’m standing still."*  

*"And my grin—it’s getting wider every day. My cheeks hurt from how much they stretch now. My teeth feel sharper too—like they’re growing into points."*  

*"I don’t think there’s anything left of me anymore. Whatever that thing is… whatever *I’m becoming*... it’s almost finished."*  

*"Don’t come here, Em. Stay away from me."*

Her voice sounded hollow—like she’d already given up.


 
**Day 6: The Final Message** 
The last voicemail came early in the morning—just static at first with faint scratching sounds in the background.

Then Sarah whispered: *“It’s here.”*

There was a long pause before another voice spoke—a distorted version of Sarah’s own voice: *“I’m ready.”*

The line went dead.

It’s been weeks since I last heard Sarah’s voice. Weeks since I drove out to her house, hoping—praying—that I’d find her there, safe, and that all of this had been some kind of misunderstanding. A bad dream. A mistake.

But it wasn’t.

Her car was still in the driveway, parked neatly where she always left it. The front door was unlocked, swinging open with a faint creak when I pushed it. Inside, everything was exactly how she’d left it: her favorite blanket draped over the couch, a half-empty coffee mug on the kitchen counter, her phone sitting on the nightstand next to her bed. It was like she’d just stepped out for a moment and would be back any second.

But she wasn’t.

I searched every room, calling her name over and over again until my throat felt raw. There was no sign of her—no blood, no struggle, no footprints leading away from the house. Nothing. It was as if she had simply vanished into thin air.

Except for the mirrors.

Every single mirror in the house—bathroom, bedroom, hallway—was covered in deep scratches. Long, jagged claw marks that crisscrossed the glass in chaotic patterns. Some of them were so deep that pieces of the mirror had shattered onto the floor. But what disturbed me most was what I saw when I looked into them.

Or rather, what I didn’t see.

My reflection wasn’t… right. It was subtle at first—just a slight delay in my movements or a flicker of something in the corner of my eye. But the longer I stared, the more wrong it became. My reflection’s grin stretched wider than it should have, its teeth sharper than mine could ever be. Its eyes seemed darker too—empty pits that swallowed the light around them.

I ran out of that house as fast as I could and haven’t been back since.

But it didn’t end there.

At first, I thought I was imagining things. The faint scratching sounds at my bedroom window late at night. The feeling of being watched when I walked past darkened hallways or glanced into reflective surfaces. I told myself it was just paranoia—that my mind was playing tricks on me after everything that happened with Sarah.

But then I started seeing it.

The figure Sarah described—the tall, hunched thing with impossibly long arms and that horrible grin—it’s here now. Watching me from the shadows just like it watched her. Sometimes it stands outside my window at night, its black eyes staring straight through me as if it knows every thought in my head. Other times, I catch glimpses of it in mirrors or reflections: standing behind me when no one else is there or grinning at me from across the room when I turn away.

I’ve started hearing its voice too—soft whispers in the dead of night that sound like Sarah’s but… wrong somehow. Distorted. Twisted. It calls my name over and over again, telling me to “come closer” or “let it in.” Sometimes it laughs—a low, guttural sound that makes my skin crawl.

I’ve tried ignoring it, pretending it isn’t real—but every day, it gets harder to fight. My reflection has started moving on its own now: smiling when I’m not smiling or tilting its head at angles that make my neck ache just looking at them. And my grin… oh God… my grin is getting wider too.

It hurts to smile this much—to feel my cheeks stretch and crack like they’re being pulled apart by invisible hands. My teeth feel sharper every day; sometimes they cut into my lips without warning, leaving trails of blood that taste too sweet to be mine.

I think… I think Sarah was right. It doesn’t want to kill me—it wants to *replace* me.

This will probably be my last entry—my last chance to warn anyone who finds this before it’s too late. If you’re reading this… if you hear scratching at your window or see something grinning at you from the corner of your eye… don’t look at it. Don’t let it in.

And whatever you do… don’t smile back.

*The scratching has started again.*  

*It’s here.*

*And this time…*  

*I think I’m ready.*
