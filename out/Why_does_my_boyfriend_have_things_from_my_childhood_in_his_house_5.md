Update to this post  [Why does my boyfriend have things from my childhood in his house? (4) : nosleep (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/131kspo/why_does_my_boyfriend_have_things_from_my/)

This is probably going to be the last thing I post on here - mum and I are trying to leave and I won't take my phone/laptop with me either. Wrote the last two updates when the police came - we called them to say that we might be the targets of a potential home invasion and they said that they couldn't 'wait around' as Tom wasn't actually here, telling us to call if anything happens. We don't want to wait. I don't even know if his text was an empty threat or what but we're leaving anyway for a hotel. I took into account the advice that everyone gave me - thank you. You've all been a great source of comfort and reason over the last few days.

There are still so many unanswered questions - why/how Tom and his family have used the ritual, why I am a target twelve years later, why Pryham didn't know about their existence - but I need to leave, need to go. I'm sorry I wish I could give everyone an answer or tell you that I'll be ok but I just don't know. I'm sorry for leaving so many loose ends still in the air.

Going now, mum's already in the car. Sorry again.

\- Emma

This was the last thing Emma ever posted on the Internet.

My name is John Stevens and I'm a PD. I've been following this case for two years, which seemed like it was running cold until I received access to Emma's social media accounts. Everything she wrote over the four days or so paints a picture of the emotional turmoil that she and her mother went through, as well as suspects in her disappearance and her mother's death.

I'll enclose a transcript from a 999 call that occurred approximately two days after Emma wrote her last update, the police report of the area in which it was traced from, as well as a description of her appearance - anything to aid our search. It seems as though she dropped off the face of the earth.

If you have any information, please call the Pryham police department. Even though they've been tirelessly searching the woods near their village for the last two years it's been a futile effort. I hope what I enclose will make the picture somewhat clearer.

Reporting Officer (s) - PC Jacob Townsend and Miranda Sharp

Desc. of incident : Call received to emergency services at 1:26AM, officers arrived at the scene at approximately 1:42AM. Caller in great distress, break-in to hotel room.

Room in a mess - bed overturned and luggage strewn across the room. Caller's mother found in the bathroom, unresponsive. Attempted resuscitation unsuccessful - head trauma evident. Caller herself is not found - checked the rest of the building and there is no sign of her at all.

Various signs of a struggle throughout the room - bloodstains and human hair as well as nail marks on the door (possibly the victim trying to resist capture?). But what makes this strange is the other qualities of the room. Rudimentary circle of salt around the door, reasons unknown, as well as a partially-burnt photograph of a young girl discarded near the bed. Burn marks, such as a small black one on the wall near the bed, are apparent.

Actions taken: Closed off entire floor for investigation and cordoned it. Will analyse hair and blood samples at a later date, and run a background check on the victim to gain some further information about the suspect.
