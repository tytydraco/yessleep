The other night i went to sleep around 2 am. I woke up the next morning and it was my friends birthday so i looked at my photos to see if i have one to post. I noticed the first three recent photos i dont remember taking. For context i sleep alone in my home with my dog in the kennel outside my room. I have no led lights or any lights on in my room when i sleep. The 3 photos were taken at 4:30 am. The first one was a black screen with a luminous red squiggled line, with large red spots around it. The second was a flash photo of my blinds. The third was a flash photo angled down at me sleeping with only my leg and bed in the frame. The two of me sleeping i have convinced myself i did it in my sleep. But i cannot explain the red line. The next day i slept with my dog in my room. At the same time at night he began barking and growling at my tv in my room. I turned the light on and he stopped. I comforted him and then took him outside. When i got back into my room with my dog i turned the lights off and then got back into bed and he stated barking at the same thing. I tested to see if maybe it was his reflection but my room is so dark nothing reflects off the tv. I have been sleeping with a rosary around my neck and it seems to be working but maybe im just paranoid. Any advice?

Shortened: Weird photos taken of me and my room while i was sleeping alone. The next day my dog barked at nothing in the dark
