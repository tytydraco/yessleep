So.... where to begin? I guess the beginning. My world was shattered when I was 8yrs old... and it only got worse from there. 

See, my siblings and I grew up in a house with our grandmother and my mother's father Greg (I do not call him the other thing for reasons that will be clear as we progress). Greg was not a good man. In fact, he's the definition of a living breathing monster. Things were never good. Greg physically abused me, my baby brother, and my disabled grandmother.

When I was 8 I went looking for my sister. I wanted to play outside with her. I walked into the master bedroom to find Greg's 300lb frame on top of my sister... naked. She was too. This shocked me to my core. He heard me come in and stopped what he was doing...   long enough to punch me in the face. I fell backwards, scrambled to me feet, and ran. Found a place to hide and just cried.

 In the following years my mental stability rapidly declined, I didn't sleep more than 1-3  a night in broken sessions... and Greg had taken a special interest in beating me, I guess in an attempt to keep me quiet about what I saw. It got so bad that by the time I was 10, I was 100% convinced the ONLY way to stop him was to kill him. So... I started working out a plan. The end result was a failure. Instead of a broken neck he ended up with a broken arm and a plate in that arm. Once it healed, he beat me with the plate. Beatings got more intense even prior to his arm and there was no peace to be found when I slept either as I was plagued by horrific nightmares. Sleep became even more difficult over time as I had a host of various sleep paralysis demons...

 Enter the Ceiling Lady. She was quite a few leagues above the run of the mill sleep paralysis demons. The only way I can think of to describe her is the enbodiment of sheer terror. She had grayish pale skin, wore a tattered white gown, sunken in bloodshot eyes (when she had them), gnarled teeth, and boney clawed fingers, and black hair. The night I saw her, I was petrified. I watched her crawl across the ceiling slowly towards where I laid and she positioned herself directly above me. She stared into my eyes unblinking with freakish smile twisted across her face. She didn't move all night... and I didn't sleep and I was frozen with fear. She became a nightly vistor. 
Most nights she just stared at me as if daring me to sleep. Other nights she her sick smile was a blood chilling scream that never seemed to end. I wonder know how no one else heard her. The most terrifying nights... her face melted off and dripped on me. The feeling of her ooze touching shocked me into jumping up and screaming... and any night I screamed, I was met with a fist in my gut courtesy of Greg. She was never noticed. I eventually trained myself not to react to her ooze... save myself the physical pain where I could. 
Eventually, I was able to sleep for 30-45min in 5-10 min... and she was there no matter what. When I slept, she was in my nightmares along with whatever other horrors tormented my dreams. Then when I woke, scared out of my mind, she was there; perched above me (sometimes with her face melted off) just staring me (either with her bloodshot eyes or dark cavernous empty sockets). 

My life for as long as I can remember was torment in the day, terror at night, and horror in my sleep. I don't remember when she stopped visiting... but I am sure glad she did. I wish I hadn't unlocked these memories but now that I have... I need to know what she is or was. Any ideas are welcome. I have hit a dead end multiple times.
