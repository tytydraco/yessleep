This situation is getting out of control. I don't know where to go or if this is even the right place to post it. Normally I post on r/RBI for this kind of thing but they didn't believe me. I don't know what's going on.... it just doesn't make sense.

But here's what's happened so far.

Yesterday I was on a random subreddit. It was just a mundane daily discussion thread and people were talking about getting ready for the weekend. I mentioned I had plans and explained that I was going on a trip.

I wrote:

"Getting ready for camping this weekend. Sitting here with a warm cup of coffee and listening to some tunes. Favourite slippers and dog is resting by the fireplace. Life is good."

I got a few responses telling me to have a good trip and to stay safe. On the account I posted I really don't share too much information. I always make a point to keep things private. I'm posting on a throwaway now but I don't think it'll help.

I saw the orange icon over the bell and clicked.

*New notification: "Are you me?"*

At first I smiled, I was thinking 'right on, buddy's going camping too'. I clicked on the message and started typing my response.

'Nice! Have a good time. Are you bringing the pup?'

The response came literally instantaneously after I pressed send...

"No. I'm not bringing the pup. He gets skittish. Last time I did he ran into the woods and we spent twenty minutes looking for him. I'm sending him to the kennel. Also... "

"*Are you me?"*

When I read the message I felt myself go cold. It was incredibly strange.

This person was describing the exact situation that happened last time I went camping.

"Woah... that's so strange. Yeah same here. " I typed trying to be rational.

The fact that they wrote 'are you me' again was bizarre. I thought maybe they didn't know how to 'meme'. I tried to play it off as a joke.

"Next you'll tell me you have a golden retriever and are listening to jazz? Lol."

"And no... "I'm not you" Lol. T*he joke works better if you say it once*"

I felt like an idiot for even having to type it out.

Once again his response was instant. I almost spit out my drink.

The first message had no text, it was only an image... an image of Charlie, my dog. But... but it wasn't Charlie, something about the dog in the photo was strange. If any random person saw the photos they would think, 100% that it was the same dog, but there was something wrong, something about the dogs eyes.

The dog had lifeless eyes, like there was nothing behind them. Completely dead.

Other than the dog there was nothing in the photo but grass... I looked at Charlie gnawing a bone by the fireplace.

'Ch... charlie, come here boy' I said my voice wavering. I half expected when he looked up at me to see those same eyes as the dog from the photo.

His ears perked up and he ran up to me wagging his tail. Happy as usual.

"Good dog" I said petting him, laughing in relief and honestly almost crying a bit because the Dog in the photo looked so... I don't know, evil, like it was soulless.

Then I checked my second notification and felt a surge of nausea well up.

"Smooth Jazz, relaxing chill study work reading playlist"

It was the exact same video I was listening to...

My hands were literally shaking as I typed 'That's... that's the one. The exact playlist..."

A notification popped up again only this time it took a minute or so.

"Spooky. This is r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix material."

It was a random user.

I started to type "Honestly I'm a little freaked out..." but I decided I wasn't going to say anything.

I clicked off the page and started browsing some other posts. If this was bothering me I should just ignore it, it was obviously just one of those super unlikely coincidences. Like that woman who met her identical twin overseas in a restaurant, or the guy who went on vacation to some random place and saw his missing neighbour. Something like that I thought.

I should have let it go but as you can tell from reading this, I clicked back on the comment chain.

*Hightened-Flipper3467* "Honestly I'm a little freaked out... "

I felt like I was going to pass out. I started typing a chat message to him.

"What is this some kind of joke? You're following me or something? You think you're hilarious huh?"

Before a normal person could read the comment and rationalize a response, the text appeared.

"Are you me?"

A second later, a photo. It was an image of the soulless imitation of Charlie and a man standing with his face to a wall.

But it wasn't just a man... it was... it was...

Same rain jacket on my coat stand, same pair of runners, same hair cut, same height...

*It was me.*

"What is this some elaborate prank. Who are you? Why are you doing this!?"

I slammed my hands on the table in front me in anger.

'I think... I think I'm you' the text appeared.

He was taunting me.

"Yeah... well how about you kiss MY ass then."

I closed the chat and blocked him.

Now I'm here writing this to you guys. I think I need to get out of the house. I think I'm going to leave for camping early, and I'm going to bring Charlie. I know the cops won't take it seriously because there hasn't been a threat.

They'd probably think I was trolling them taking pictures of myself...

I gotta get out of here. There are some trails deeper in the mountains that I've always wanted to take, maybe this is an excuse to? I'll bring my climbing gear and tbh I think I need to borrow a gun. I know it's crazy but the vibe for this is just way way off.

I'm just threw up and am sweating right now. What am I supposed to do?

EDIT: I'm in the car and I just got message from a random number... this is crazy

He said... 'Don't go...' and when I looked at the attached image it was a photo of... a photo of Charlie at the bottom of a cliff... d... dead. I'm still going.

I just got another text while writing this... I'm going to check it...

All it said was... 'DON'T GO' repeatedly... like a hundred times,

Another photo of the fake me... but he was, he was on the ground beside Charlie. I couldn't see the face. It looked like he fell... he was... dead.

I'm really scared now but I can't stay here. I have to go out to the woods. I'll leave the climbing gear behind, it'll be fine... I just have to get out of town.

This is a prank right? I just won't climb to be safe.

This can't be happening.
