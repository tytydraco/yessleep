“Cold,” I murmur, wincing as the icy metal presses against my back.

The chill seeps into me like an unwelcome intruder, settling deep in my bones and making itself comfortable. The air smells like old piss, rot, and something faintly metallic. Real ambiance. Five stars. Would not recommend.

I try to remember how I got here.

Nothing.

No flashes. No half-formed memories. Just a big, empty void where my past should be. Honestly, it’s kind of impressive. My brain is really committed to the bit.

Okay. Fine. Start small.

Name?

…Nope.

Age?

Also no.

Well. That’s unfortunate.

Panic curls low in my chest. I can feel it warming up, getting ready to stretch its legs. Any second now, I’m going to spiral—

—but then I hear it.

A low groan. Human. Definitely human.

I turn my head and spot him lying a few feet away, curled slightly like he’s reconsidering every life choice that led him here. His face is pinched, caught somewhere between pain and regret.

“Hey,” I say lightly. “You alive, or should I start looting?”

No response.

I sigh and nudge him with my foot. “C’mon. I don’t have all day.”

He stirs, groans again, and finally cracks his eyes open. We lock eyes.

The smell hits him a second later.

He gags violently, clapping a hand over his mouth. I wave my hand in front of my face out of habit, like that’ll magically fix it.

Then he looks around finally noticing me, like he’s just now realizing I exist. I brace myself for the obvious questions—where are we, who are you—but instead he blurts, “Did you kidnap me?”

I blink.

Then I laugh. Just a short, surprised burst. “Wow. No. If I had, you’d be tied up. And I’d have already left.”

That earns me a scowl.

“Then who are you?” he snaps. “And where are we?”

“I don’t know, buddy,” I say easily. “Your guess is as good as mine.”

He studies me for a beat. “What’s your name?”

I hesitate—just a fraction too long.

“You first,” I say.

“Mason,” he replies flatly.

“Jessy,” I say quickly, the name slipping out before I can overthink it. I immediately regret it. Not because it’s a lie—because it feels… thin. Like a placeholder slapped over something missing.

I glance away before he can ask anything else.

That’s when I notice it.

A warped slab of wood barely clinging to the far wall. A door, in the loosest sense of the word.

“Is that supposed to be a—”

He’s already moving.

He strides toward it so fast he nearly bowls me over, and I have to stumble out of his way.

“What the hell?” I hissed. “I thought we were having a conversation.”

“Waiting around isn’t helping,” he says, grabbing the handle.

“Wait!” I snap, my horror-movie instincts kicking in hard. “What if there’s something out there?”

He throws me a sideways glance. “Look around. Whatever’s out there can’t be worse than being stuck here.”

“That is exactly the kind of logic that gets people killed in horror movies,” I mutter.

But he’s already pulled the door open.

Darkness spills in, swallowing the weak light behind us.

Perfect.

I can’t see my own hand in front of my face—let alone the idiot leading the way.

“Awesome,” I mutter. “This is definitely how I die. Lost in the dark with Trust Issues.” “You got a better plan?” his voice drifts back to me, clipped and annoyed. “Because standing around isn’t it.” We push farther in—and then the space opens up. Moonlight spills in through long, narrow windows lining the walls, pale silver bars cutting through the darkness.

It’s just enough light to see by—and just enough to make things worse. The room stretches upward, the ceiling impossibly high, wooden beams vanishing into darkness. This isn’t just a kidnapping room. It’s a shed. A big one. And the air doesn’t just feel wrong—it feels like it’s waiting, like it knows we shouldn’t be here.

“Do you have a plan,” I ask, eyeing the barely visible outline of Trust Issues in the pale moonlight, “or are we just… rawdogging this?”

“Shut up,” he mutters, already moving, touching everything around him as if the walls themselves will answer questions.

That’s when I notice it.

A lever.

The kind of lever that screams don’t touch me. But sadly common sense is not that common. Especially not for him.

He pulls it anyway.

“Don’t—” I start, but nothing happens.

We stand there, still as tombstones, waiting for the trap that should have sprung.

He turns to me, chest puffed, that smug “I told you so” expression in place. “See? Nothing happened.”

And then I feel it.

A faint squelch.

My stomach twists. The air thickens, heavy and sharp with metallic tang. Something wet and cold splatters against my cheek.

I freeze.

“What the—?” Another drop hits him. He swipes at his face, cursing under his breath. “What is this?”

I glance down at my shaking hands. Dark. Sticky. Gleaming faintly in the moonlight.

“Yep,” I mutter weakly. “Just red juice.”

I refused to believe it.

The smell hits next—iron, sharp, unmistakable. Blood. My stomach tightens as panic claws up my spine. 

I look at Trust Issues. He’s frozen, eyes wide, locked on something above me. I follow his gaze.

Hanging from the ceiling is a hogtied sheep. Its belly slit open, entrails spilling down like a grotesque, slow-motion piñata. It sways slightly in the draft, a quiet pendulum counting down some unseen clock.

Blood streaks the beams above, carved into jagged symbols, sharp and deliberate. They shine wetly in the moonlight, like they’re daring me to understand them. To make sense.

Flies swarm the carcass, buzzing, vibrating against the silence. And somewhere above, a faint creak like the ceiling itself is alive, straining under the weight of the gutted sheep.

Trust Issues’ breath hitches. “This is…” His voice cracks. “What the hell is this?”

I whisper, voice tighter than I mean it to be. “I don’t know. But I’m pretty sure we’re not alone.”

I don’t say anything after that.

Talking feels unsafe. Like the room is watching us. Like if I speak too loud something will answer.

Instead, I grab Trust Issues by the sleeve and yank him sideways, dragging him behind one of the massive support pillars. He’s shaking hard now, retching into the dirt, folded in on himself like a newborn deer that already knows it won’t survive the winter. I put a hand on his back, instinctively trying to calm him. 

The wood presses rough and damp into my shoulder, stained black where old blood has soaked so deep it feels permanent. Not spilled. *Absorbed.*

We crouch there, breathing too loud.

I wait.

Nothing happens.

No footsteps. No reveal. No villain stepping into the moonlight. Just the sheep above us, swaying gently, dripping like a broken sink no one ever bothered to fix.

My heart slows, reluctantly.

Then I hear it.

A buzz.

Not loud. Not mechanical. Subtle. Almost polite.

I scan the floor, the beams, the shadows—until something drops from the sheep’s carcass and lands with a wet thud near my knee.

A phone.

It’s sealed inside a ziplock bag, smeared red but intact, like someone went out of their way to protect it.

My fingers hesitate before I pick it up.

The screen lights instantly.

No password.

No bars. Obviously. Still, I try.

I dial 911.

No ringing. No error message. No “call failed.”

Just silence.

Like the number doesn’t exist here.

“Shit,” I whisper.

Trust Issues peeks out from behind the pillar, eyes wild. “No signal?”

“Yeah...,” I say, staring at the screen.

Battery: **100%**.

That felt wrong like the phone was waiting to be found.

There’s only one app installed.

Google.

It’s already open.

Except it isn’t a search page.

It’s Reddit.

Specifically: r/nosleep 

No posts. No comments. No usernames. Just a blank screen and a single button at the center.

**POST**

My throat tightens.

I can’t see anything else. No history. No sidebar. No way to scroll.

Just the button.

Like the room doesn’t want me to read.

It wants me to write.

I look up at the sheep. At the symbols carved into the beams. At the dark that feels… aware.

Then I look back at the phone and start typing.

It's been 2 hours and I just finished writing. The battery… still reads 100%.
