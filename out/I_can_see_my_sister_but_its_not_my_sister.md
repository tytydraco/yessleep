Okay guys this is my first time writing so please let me know if I made some mistakes.

I live in a joint family. For safety reasons there is a small glass window at the top of the wall which separates my uncle and our part of the house. You can easily see if someone is on the stairs from that window. I am currently in my room. From where I am sitting I can clearly see that window. It's been a few minutes, I am scrolling through tiktok and my baby brother is sleeping right beside me.  I suddenly feel cold. I cannot shake the feeling of being watched. Out of reflex, I looked at that window. I saw something..... Something or someone is staring right at me but who?. I looked for a minute without moving. It's my sister. Oh my god she literally scared the shit out of me Jesus. "Hey jaaz can you make something to eat? I am starving." I said to my sister. She didn't respond.  "I don't know what's wrong with her" I mumbled.

 After an hour of scrolling through tiktok, I looked at that window again. She was there. Not moving maybe not even breathing. Then it clicked me, my sister... My sister is in Australia. It's been 3 months. She was still in Australia. We just called last night and she told me about her day IN AUSTRALIA. If she is in another country then who is she?. Why is she staring at me. 

I can't move. My brother is still sleeping and that thing is still looking at me. I can't get up. I can't call anyone. My family is at my relative's house. It's only me and my brother. I feel like if I move the thing will jump at me. I can still see it. It's still staring at me but I can see blood dripping from its eyes. I don't know what I should do?. Should I run? But I can't leave my brother here. Maybe it would not do any harm since there is a massive wall between us and it's not even moving. Am I imagining? 
It moved... It smiled at me. I can't look at it anymore. It doesn't look like my sister anymore. I can see the blood coming out of its eyes and nose. It's smiling at me. I can see the teeth, it's all rotten. I have never seen anything this hideous in my life. The eye... Why is it so black? Is that just the eye or is it the blood?? No it can't be my sister. OH MY GOD WHY DIDN'T I NOTICED THIS EARLIER???????  HER NECK WHY DO IT HAVE A KNIFE STUCK IN IT??? She is walking towards the window. Slowly but steadily. Every time it walks it makes a noise like someone is pulling a heavy metal against the floor. It is at the window pressing its hideous face against the glass. It's 7pm and my family should be here soon. I'll be okay. The thing will go away once my family comes home. 

*DING*. I just got a text from my dad, "something happened we'll be late, eat something and sleep in time." FUCK IT WHY TODAY. It tapped in the glass and smiled. I think she knows that now I am all alone. It knows no one will save me. It's calling me. She sounds like my sister. I don't want to go. I don't want to look at her but something.. something in my body is forcing me to get up and move towards her. I am at the door right now. I don't want to go. I know the moment I open that window I won't be alive. What about my brother.. he is 6. 

*Ding* "honey we'll be there in 10 minutes" mom texted. I have to hang on for 10 minutes. Just 10 minutes and everything will be okay. It'll be okay. Everything will be okay. Everything will be okay.....right??. Everything will b....
