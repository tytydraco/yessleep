Journal Entry - Ada Marie, October 23rd, 2023  
  
Navigating the first circle of Little Space Hell felt like walking through a labyrinth of despair. The very air felt thick, almost gelatinous, with an ominous dread that stifled my breath. It clung to me like a second skin, humming with the echoes of lost innocence and forsaken childhood. In this dystopia of anguish, a singular figure emerged like a glimmer of misplaced hope: a plush bunny, its fur the soft shade of lavender. Its twinkling, button-like eyes seemed disturbingly incongruous in such an unforgiving setting.  
  
"Hello? Are you real?" I cautiously approached the stuffed creature, half expecting it to turn into another monstrosity.  
  
The bunny blinked up at me with surprising serenity. "Hey there, I'm Callie," it spoke in a voice so tender it belied the grim backdrop. "What brings you to this forsaken corner of existence?"  
  
Shaking off my incredulity, I poured out my situation to Callie, an audience so surreal I could hardly believe I was speaking to it. "You're not supposed to be here," she assessed, twitching her long ears in contemplation. "And certainly not Kit. She’s as out of place as a sunflower in a graveyard."  
  
A fleeting spark of hope ignited within me. Together, we negotiated the labyrinthine horrors of this fractured fairy tale. Toy soldiers now set their mechanized sights on us; their once aimless march coalesced into a singular purpose—to prevent our advance. Their footsteps harmonized with the never-ending, grating lullaby that reverberated in the air like a cursed symphony. The laughter of phantom children would periodically break through, each giggle a haunting reverberation that sent icy shivers down my spine.  
  
Then came the river—a flowing torrent of tears streaming from the face of a gigantic, sobbing baby doll. With Callie’s intuitive guidance, we managed to cross using floating toy blocks that bobbed precariously in the saline deluge. But as we almost reached the other side, the doll’s grotesque hand lunged up, nearly dragging me into the brackish depths of its sorrow.  
  
The maze that followed was a sinuous tangle of rose bushes, but these were not the blooms of love or beauty. They were monstrous, overgrown things, their thorns like serrated knives. Soft whispers filled the air, unseen mouths trying to seduce us into eternal misdirection. But Callie, steadfast and ever hopeful, her cotton heart pounding like a distant drum, guided us through the twisted labyrinth.  
  
Finally, we arrived at an imposing door. It was adorned with celestial designs of moons and stars, their patterns shimmering in a rare display of beauty. "Beyond this lies the second circle," Callie whispered, her voice tinged with both anticipation and dread.  
  
Summoning every ounce of courage, we pushed the door ajar, tensing for whatever abominable visions awaited us in the next unholy realm of Little Space Hell.

The disquietude grew exponentially as Callie and I wandered deeper into the twisted bowels of this unholy realm. As we crossed the threshold into the second Little Space Circle of Hell, the air itself seemed to mutate, becoming a dense, foggy murk that felt like it could suffocate us. It wasn't just a physical smog; it was a miasma of despair, of lost youth and corrupted innocence.  
  
Upon entry, the nauseating sight that befell us was that of a seemingly boundless playground, but this was no place of fun or laughter. The swings swayed in unison, creaking like the anguished moans of spirits damned to eternal misery. The slides were towering monstrosities, each twist and turn defying the very laws of physics, spiraling into the heavens like a stairway of despair. And the seesaws moved in a ghoulish rhythm, propelled by some invisible, malevolent force.  
  
When I dared to step closer to the sandbox, it felt like a violation. The sand whispered, voices skittering across the surface like malevolent spirits. A chorus of ethereal cries from the buried souls of forgotten children reached for me, their lamentations clawing at the very fabric of my sanity.  
  
And then it started—the music. It was the most perverse orchestration of nursery rhymes, every note a mockery, played backward as though to unravel the very threads of a wholesome childhood. These twisted tunes enveloped us, wrapping around our souls like shrouds of icy despair. Flickering in the foggy distance were translucent figures of children; their visage appeared almost hopeful until I dared to meet their hollowed gaze. Their mouths opened, articulating a silent "help," each plea echoing through the mist, amplifying the torment of this spectral playground.  
  
Callie's grip tightened, her stuffed paws pulling me towards what appeared to be a toy store. But this was no sanctuary; it was a chamber of horrors. Shelves overflowed with mutilated toys—dolls with gouged-out eyes, teddy bears shredded and limbless, and toy soldiers distorted by melting as if consumed by some invisible inferno. As we watched, frozen in terror, these abominations began to twitch and writhe, trying to reassemble their broken forms in a grotesque parody of life.  
  
Centered in this arena of fear was a carousel, but its steeds were no ordinary creatures. They were grotesque mockeries of familiar animals, their eyes not gleaming but mournful, as if yearning for a merciful end to their ceaseless spinning. The tune it hummed was a dirge, a sorrowful lullaby designed to drown its listeners in an abyss of eternal, dreamless sleep.  
  
Navigating this labyrinthine nightmare, we stumbled upon jigsaw puzzles strewn across the ground. They were supposed to depict scenes of jubilant childhood memories, but no piece fit correctly; each was a dissonant fragment in a mosaic of perpetual incompleteness.  
  
Yet, amidst this swirling vortex of fear and melancholy, the touch of Callie's soft paw gave me an inkling of courage. We had a purpose: to find Little Kit and to escape this malevolent realm. For even in a landscape crafted from the darkest nightmares of childhood, the resilience of family and the glimmer of hope were forces that not even this hell could diminish.  
  
Ada.  
  
Journal Entry - Ada Marie, October 25th, 2023  
  
The passage to the third circle of Little Space Hell was like crossing into the belly of some loathsome beast. As Callie and I ventured forward, the air thickened into a miasmic fog that was both tangible and psychological, tainting our very souls. This was a nursery, or at least a grotesque caricature of one. It bore all the trappings of a place meant for comfort and care but twisted into an ungodly form that could only spell torment.  
  
The shadows here were darker, longer, and more insidious. They crawled across the walls like living entities, stretching and contorting in ways that defied reason, working in concert to confuse and terrorize my already fragile mind.  
  
But what arrested my gaze—and instilled a jolt of dread so potent that it cut through the thick atmosphere—was Little Kit. Chained to a demonic crib at the room's core, her pale face was a mask of terror, her eyes dilated in unspeakable fear. Fresh scratches marred her tiny hands, evidence of a struggle, perhaps an attempt to break free. "Please, hurry before he comes back," she trembled, her voice a mere wisp in this realm of despair.  
  
The room was also a prison for stuffies—bears, bunnies, dragons—all shackled and defaced, dangling from the walls like trophies of some infernal hunter. Their once-plush bodies bore signs of torment; their eyes were windows to an eternal agony, devoid of any hope.  
  
Then, chilling whispers filled the air, as distant as a fading echo yet as clear as crystal: "You need to leave. Before the caregiver returns." A chill ran down my spine, an icy touch that was almost corporeal.  
  
No sooner had the whispers died down than the temperature plummeted, the cold slicing through us like a blade of eternal winter. Emerging from the room's darkest corner was Jehongor, adopting the guise of a twisted caregiver. His eyes, burning like hot coals, stared at us with a malevolence that promised unimaginable suffering.  
  
From the wall, two toy swords dislodged themselves and flew into our hands. Despite their toy-like appearance, they pulsed with an energy that was both ancient and powerful. Callie and I wielded them as if we were knights anointed for this very quest.  
  
The battle that ensued was no less than apocalyptic. Our toy swords clashed with Jehongor's malevolent spells, each strike emitting bursts of ethereal light that temporarily dispelled the room's darkness. The walls seemed to groan and tremble under the force of our combat, as if they too were living entities, sickened by the dark magic that pervaded them.  
  
The stuffies, hanging like forsaken souls, suddenly found their voice. Their cries rang out, an ethereal choir imbued with a desperate hope. Little Kit’s eyes shimmered with tears, but they were no longer tears of helplessness; they were tears of defiance and undying resolve.  
  
Each move we made was a testament to the human spirit’s unwillingness to succumb to darkness. With every clash of our swords, with every spell countered, we were not just fighting Jehongor; we were fighting the vile nature of this accursed realm itself.  
  
And as the battle raged, it became clear: surrender was not an option. For Little Kit, for the stuffies, for every lost soul imprisoned in this twisted mockery of a nursery, we would fight until the very walls crumbled into dust or until we had drawn our last breath.

Amid the chaos of clashing swords and the maelstrom of dark magic that whipped around the room, Jehongor's voice rose, dripping with malevolent glee. "You fancy yourself a paragon, don’t you, Ada? A shining beacon of morality? What about that dark, hidden chasm in your soul? That sordid secret you've never even shared with your dear Little Kit?"  
  
His words clawed at me, sending ice-cold rivulets of sweat down my back. My heart hammered so violently against my ribcage that I felt it might explode. "What are you insinuating?" I hurled back at him, a quiver of dread destabilizing my voice.  
  
His laugh was a grotesque melody, echoing like the wails of the damned. "Oh, let's not play innocent. The clandestine romance with your co-worker—you reveled in it, didn’t you? Relished the stolen moments, the thrill of deceit, convinced your secret would remain forever buried. But the ensuing catastrophe was both real and horrifying."  
  
I reeled back, the mystical toy sword nearly slipping from my sweaty grasp. An avalanche of memories engulfed me, each one a jagged piece in a mosaic of betrayal. Those stolen trysts, whispers in the dark, the excitement that was as fleeting as it was intoxicating. But the elation was swallowed whole by the immense pain that unfolded later—the dissolution of her family, the anguished wails of her children, their questioning eyes, their hearts shattered into a thousand pieces. And the final, irrevocable act: her husband's suicide. Overwhelmed by betrayal and heartbreak, he took his own life, ending it all with the grim finality of a rope.  
  
My knees buckled, a pit opening inside me that was so deep and dark I feared I'd never escape. "I never... never intended for any of it," I croaked, tears blurring my vision and mingling with the sweat on my face.  
  
Jehongor's sneer stretched grotesquely, reveling in my torment. "But it occurred all the same, and it's all because of you. How does it feel to stand naked, your darkest deeds laid bare for all to see?"  
  
The walls seemed to close in on me, each inch they moved accompanied by an ungodly creaking, as if the room itself were sharing in Jehongor's judgment. I felt my very essence unraveling, thread by agonizing thread. But just then, my gaze met Little Kit's eyes—those pools of innocence and fear—and a spark ignited within me.  
  
"The past is the past," I rasped, my voice marred by tears yet tinged with a newfound resolve. "Your psychological torture won't weaken me anymore. I've made mistakes, grave mistakes. But I'll not be enslaved by them, nor by you."  
  
And in that moment, with Little Kit as my beacon, I understood that the only thing more formidable than the past's haunting specters was the will of a soul committed to redemption. And with that newfound understanding, I readied myself for the next wave of this unending nightmare.  
  
Ada.

The residual cacophony of clashing swords and incantations reverberated in my head, a dissonant soundtrack to the battle we had fought and—seemingly—won. But triumph was a fragile state of mind, an illusion in this nightmare-scape. Jehongor, though vanquished, was a malevolence that would not be easily eradicated. His essence was woven into the dark tapestry of the universe, poised to reemerge from the inky depths whenever our vigilance wavered.  
  
As the walls of that unholy nursery started to distort, twisting and contorting in an unsettling dance, I felt the gravitational pull of reality, wrenching me back from this parallel abyss. When my eyes fluttered open, I was back in the comfort of my own bed, the sheets soaked with the sweat of terror. Little Kit was snuggled up beside me, clinging to a stuffed bunny. Callie, reduced to mere fabric and stuffing, was no longer the guardian spirit we had fought alongside. She was a mute plushie, her valor and voice confined to the realm we had barely escaped.  
  
I tenderly swept strands of hair away from Kit's face, my fingers trembling with the weight of the terrible responsibility that loomed. The ritual to eternally sever Jehongor from our world had to be executed. Not merely for our own safety, but for the soul of humanity. And there was no better time than Halloween. The night when the barrier between the corporeal and the spectral thinned to near transparency—providing a momentary gateway to banish Jehongor's insidious spirit for eternity.  
  
A steely resolve crystallized within me. Time was slipping through the hourglass; only a handful of days remained until the night of All Hallows' Eve. A night replete with folklore and legend, where the forces of darkness roamed freely; this Halloween, however, would be different. On this upcoming night of ghosts and goblins, we would bind and banish Jehongor's malevolent soul into eternal darkness.  
  
Little Kit squirmed beside me, her tiny fingers squeezing Callie the bunny as if drawing courage from its plush form. Her eyes fluttered open, brimming with a complicated brew of childlike fear and uncanny resolve. "We're going to stop him, right, Sis?"  
  
Gazing into her eyes, I felt a profound surge of love and protectiveness. I leaned down and planted a tender kiss on her forehead, pulling her into an embrace that I wished could shield her from all the world's horrors. "Yes, my sweet angel, we will. We will lock that monster away and throw away the key. We will do it together, and we will make sure he never haunts another soul."  
  
And as I held Kit close, I realized that even if Jehongor's darkness was eternal, so too was the love and courage that fueled us. For in this unending battle between good and evil, it was love that would be our ultimate weapon.

The omnipresent weight of the impending ritual loomed like a storm cloud over my soul. Each tick-tock of the aging grandfather clock felt like a heartbeat in a dirge, counting down to the ominous night of Halloween. An unbearable tension saturated the air, thicker than the mist in a haunted graveyard. The accursed divot box, resting malevolently on an ancient wooden table, glared at me. Its embedded eye, a swirling vortex of inky blackness, blinked slowly, casting malevolent glances that seemed to penetrate the deepest corridors of my psyche. It was a Pandora's box of malevolence, once containing Jehongor’s unimaginable evil, but now serving as a dreadful reminder of the Pandora's box we had unwittingly unleashed upon the world.  
  
Throughout the grueling daylight hours, I immersed myself in the alchemy of gathering. Every root, every talisman, every forbidden scroll had a role to play. Memories of forgotten Filipino lore swirled in my mind like malevolent specters, dictating the alchemical synthesis needed to ensnare Jehongor once more. Tales of the box, tales of disembodied eyes, and tales of Jehongor’s original imprisonment became a nightmarish tapestry only I could comprehend.  
  
The will-o-wisps, spirits tethered to our realm, hovered persistently around us. Their incandescent glows suffused the rooms with an otherworldly aura, as if pleading with the cosmic powers to intervene. With each passing hour, their brilliance intensified, mimicking a celestial path we were predestined to follow, a lighthouse in our metaphysical tempest.  
  
As night descended like a shroud, I found myself in the barely illuminated chamber that would serve as the theater for our supernatural endeavor. The air was thick with incense, sweet but choking. The will-o-wisps circled me, their lights oscillating in a mesmerizing but disquieting dance, like embers in an occult fire. My hands, guided by ancestral wisdom and desperate courage, moved deliberately. Each chalk-drawn sigil, each arcane incantation was a stitch in the fabric of the reality we sought to mend, or perhaps more accurately, to barricade against the encroaching malevolence.  
  
In that haunting space, etching protective runes and aligning energies, I felt the enormous burden of the lives at stake. My family's very essence, particularly that of my beloved Little Kit, hung in the balance. One misstep, one moment of doubt, could shatter the fragile barrier between us and the abyss. We had one window, one fleeting opportunity to rewrite destiny, and by every god and demon known to humankind, I was hell-bent on seizing it. Tomorrow would be another grueling chapter in our prelude to Halloween, the ultimate confrontation with an evil as ancient as time itself.  
  
Journal Log, Ada Marie, October 29th, 2023  
  
The gravity of my impending fate was no longer a nebulous concept but a tangible, oppressive force that seemed to compress my very soul. I was on the precipice, staring into an abysmal void, contemplating the irreversible act of chaining my spirit to Jehongor, the malevolent demon who had plagued us for so long. Each heartbeat, each ragged breath was a countdown to my self-imposed damnation. When my mortal vessel crumbles to dust, when my earthly clock ticks its final tock, I will plummet into the seething cauldron of Hell itself, eternally tethered to the monstrous entity that once tormented the very fabric of our reality.  
  
The paradox of my situation is a blend of horrific tragedy and somber heroism. On one grotesque side of the coin, my beloved family—my sweet, vulnerable Little Kit—and countless other innocent souls would escape the nightmarish malevolence encapsulated in the divot box, the eye, and Jehongor himself. But flipping the coin reveals my gruesome fate, a relentless eternity of suffering and torment in dimensions unfathomable to the human psyche. The soul-chilling reality is that I can't even begin to grasp the magnitude of the hellish reality that awaits me.  
  
As I sat enveloped in the mournful gloom, my thoughts turned to the sins that stained my past—the illicit affair, the devastation I had inflicted upon an entire family, and the tragic suicide of a man whose only fault was trusting too freely. Was this impending sacrifice merely a grand gesture to save humanity, or was it, in some dark, unfathomable way, penance for the horrors I had unleashed in the lives of others? The smoldering embers of guilt that consumed my soul seemed to burn brighter, fueled by this fresh infusion of existential dread.  
  
The dim light of the room cast eerie shadows on the walls as if they too were questioning my choices. I allowed the tears to cascade freely down my cheeks, each droplet a mingling of the past and future—the irrevocable history I couldn't change and the inevitable destiny I had chosen to embrace. It was an unspeakable burden, a grotesque blend of soul-crushing guilt and otherworldly responsibility. Yet, amidst this psychological tempest, I found an unyielding certainty. This was my path, strewn with thorns and marked by gargoyles of despair. I would walk it for my family, for the very fabric of existence, and perhaps, in a soul-rending twist of irony, for my own tortured redemption.  
  
Journal Log, Ada Marie, October 30th, 2023  
  
The atmosphere is electrifyingly ominous, pregnant with a sinister anticipation that clings to every crevice of our home. It's the eve of All Hallows', a time where the living and the dead dance on the edges of their respective realms. Yet, our home, which was once a sanctuary of love and comfort, now resembles the lair of some malevolent force—an energy field pulsing with dread and forewarning. The very walls seem alive, murmuring incantations, whispering dreadful secrets as if foreshadowing the abhorrent ritual that awaits.  
  
The will-o'-wisp spirits, once serene and ethereal, are now agitated, their diaphanous lights darting erratically around the house as if they are the fragmented souls of the damned. They move in frenzied orbits, casting eerie, ever-changing shadows that create the illusion of grotesque, monstrous faces peering from the darkness.  
  
My sweet, intuitive Little Kit senses the malevolent forces gathering. She clutches her stuffed bunny Callie as if her life depends on it, her eyes—a mixture of innocence and budding understanding—lock onto mine as if desperately searching for a kernel of hope. Every so often, her gaze drifts to the window, her eyes widening as they follow the chaotic dance of the will-o'-wisps. Despite the encroaching doom, I long for her to find a sliver of childhood wonder in the midst of the looming darkness.  
  
To distract ourselves from the horrifying enormity of what tomorrow holds, we've been partaking in the simpler joys of Halloween: carving pumpkins, baking ghoulish cookies, and watching spine-chilling movies. But every flickering candle in our jack-o'-lanterns, every hollow eye carved into a pumpkin's face, is a haunting reminder of the malevolent eye imprisoned within the divot box—the eye that will soon become an inextricable part of my eternal nightmare.  
  
As night tightens its grip on the world outside, so too does the horrifying reality of tomorrow’s ritual tighten around my heart. My thoughts incessantly circle back to Jehongor—the pure, unfiltered malevolence that I am volunteering to make a part of my soul. I shudder to think of the abominable bond that will soon link us in an unholy matrimony of eternal suffering.  
  
The living room has been transformed into a ritualistic chamber: an amalgamation of flickering candles, fragrant incense, and arcane symbols designed to ward off the malevolent. The will-o'-wisps gather in a spectral congregation, their luminosity focused and intensified as if swearing a spectral oath of allegiance for the terrible endeavor that lies ahead.  
  
I must rest. I must gather what shreds of strength I have left, for tomorrow will either see the dawn of a new world purged of Jehongor's malevolent shadow or plunge us into an unimaginable abyss. The price for this freedom is one that even now, as the clock ticks inexorably towards the witching hour, I can scarcely comprehend. A pact is about to be sealed, one written in the blood of my very soul.

The Halloween air was suffocating, thickened not just by anticipation but by an ungodly force that seemed to bleed from the very pores of the earth. Our house, which had felt like an infernal crucible for so long, now reverberated with the haunting laughter of ghostly trick-or-treaters and the forced mirth of my own family. It was a grotesque tableau of normalcy, for today was the day of days—the dark coronation where I would forever fuse my soul to Jehongor's abyssal essence, halting his reign of metaphysical terrorism, at least temporarily.  
  
The ritual was an eldritch spectacle beyond the darkest pits of my imagination. Amidst the luminescent will-o'-wisps that swirled like lost souls, I chanted incantations so ancient they could have predated humanity itself. The divot box pulsated in my hands, and as I recited the eldritch verses, the universe itself seemed to revolt. Reality convulsed, warping and wrenching around us in an abominable display of cosmic disapproval. Jehongor's screams, a cacophony of damnation and rage, reverberated through my skull. Yet, beneath his shrieks, there was another voice—a seductive whisper that murmured insidious promises of power and dominion.  
  
When the loathsome rite was over, when Jehongor became a fettered slave to my will, I was transformed. I felt invincible, surging with a vigor that eclipsed anything I had ever known. The festering guilt of my past misdeeds—the adulterous affair, the ghastly demise of my girlfriend's husband—seemed to disintegrate in the face of my newfound omnipotence.  
  
As my parents and my precious Little Kit encircled me, their faces dampened with tears of what I presumed was relief, I sensed their rising apprehension. The longer their arms lingered around me, the more palpable their unease became. They could feel the malevolent metamorphosis that had taken place within me.  
  
As the witching hour approached and the last of the trick-or-treaters scurried away, a dark yearning unfurled within me—a perverse itch to wield my newfound power in ways I had not yet fathomed. "I've got a quick errand to take care of, sweetheart," I whispered to Kit as I brushed a soft kiss across her forehead. Her eyes, the mirror to her innocent soul, were veiled with an unsettling mist of concern.  
  
With a cloak of shadow enshrouding me, I stepped into the freezing night air and felt a demonic exhilaration. "Time to conduct a bit of nocturnal sanitation," I murmured into the clamoring darkness, my voice tinged with malevolent glee. "I think I'll introduce the wretched souls at the local prison to my newly acquired companion."  
  
As the door latched shut behind me, I left behind not just my family, but the last tattered vestiges of my humanity, embracing an uncertain, terrifying future rife with monstrous possibilities.
