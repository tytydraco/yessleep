Mine is a cautionary tale. One that I'm reliving for the benefit of everyone out there. Did you know that stress is one of the biggest killers of men under 40? I did, and I should have paid more attention to that. But I wanted more in my life. I'd done pretty well for myself, I'd been blessed with intelligence and had put it to good use over the years, working my way up through the company to secure a great job. I worked hard and had a good income. I lived in a nice house in a quiet and safe area of town,  great friends and drove my dream car. I was comfortable and had pretty much everything I ever dreamed of, but I wanted more.

That's an unfortunate part of the human condition: we're never satisfied with what we have. We strive for better, bigger, more expensive - just more. And I was no different. I didn't recognise how fortunate I was. I never took the time to look around and actually see what I'd achieved. I wanted to grab everything with both hands. So when a new vacancy came up within the company, a more senior position which paid almost double my already handsome salary, I jumped at the opportunity.

I applied that very same day and sailed through the interview process. I was a hit with all the big wigs and they offered me the job. I started immediately. But with a bigger salary comes more responsibility, and with that comes the stress. Now, I was prepared for the added stress - or at least I thought I was - until the voices started.

I know what you're thinking - I'm crazy right? That's what I started to tell myself, especially since nobody else ever heard the voices . That was my first line of defence: dismiss it, minimise it, explain it away. I tried to rationalise that maybe I was just overhearing snippets of conversations - neighbours, people outside, something on the TV playing in the background - and in my tired state, I attributed it to something more sinister. But the thing that made it harder to ignore was that the voices were always the same.

Three of them stood out. Others came and went, like background chatter bleeding through a wall, but these three were consistent, familiar, and impossible to write off as coincidence. I started calling them by names. Now don't go thinking that naming them meant I was comforted by their presence - quite the opposite. They terrified me. But giving them names made them feel smaller somehow, something I could get a get a handle on instead of something lurking in the dark corners of my mind.

There was Moira, a woman's voice - youngish, sharp, the most aggressive of the three. She never threatened me outright, but the way she spoke... it seethed. Anger, frustration, sometimes even heartbreak. She unsettled me in ways I still can't describe.

The second voice was the least frightening, though no less strange: a little boy I called Max. Max only ever wanted to play. He sounded young - six, maybe seven - and there was a loneliness in his tone that made my chest tighten. He didn't scare me the way Moira did. If anything, I felt sorry for him. The feeling he gave me wasn't dread, but sadness - like he was waiting for someone who'd forgotten him.

The last voice was the one that truly unnerved me. Have you ever been alone in a house and heard a child crying? I don't mean a sniffle or a whine, but real guttural, heart-breaking howling - the kind that rattles your nerves and makes you want to run even if you don't know why. That was her. I called her Bella. She never spoke actual words, just cried and cried, and no amount of talking or ignoring or logic could make it stop. I could be making coffee, brushing my teeth, answering emails at work - it didn't matter. She was there, waiting somewhere just out of sight.

I began to wonder if this was how schizophrenia began, or dissociative identity disorder - some fracture in the mind that started small and then split open. But the more I listened, the more I noticed: they didn't sound like they were coming from inside my head.

They sounded... around me. Behind me. Across the room. Sometimes right next to my ear. That was when the ghost theory crept in. Ridiculous as it sounds, it made a certain kind of sense in the moment. I started thinking of them as my own personal hauntings - spirits that had latched onto me somehow, I found myself talking to them out loud, asking questions into an empty room like an idiot.

"What do you want?" I remember shouting out one night when Bella's crying had gone on for what felt like hours. Max didn't answer beyond a plaintive "Play with me?" in his usual questioning tone. Bella just howled, inconsolable as ever. But Moira? She often replied. "I want you to see me." she'd replied once, her voice low and shaking with rage. I remember standing in the kitchen, scanning every corner as if she might flicker into view.

"Then show yourself" I said. "I'm right here!" she snapped back, almost offended. Other times she muttered things I brushed off without much thought back then. "You're not listening." "You're not hearing me." "You ignore everything." When I tried to engage, she got angrier, like I was doing something wrong without knowing what. It was only during the dead of night that the voices ceased. Strange right? Not that that ruled out the ghost theory, but I thought those things were supposed to be more active at night. Sometimes, just as I was falling asleep, I'd feel the mattress shift beside me. The faint impression of weight, like someone was lying down. Once or twice, I even heard a soft "Goodnight", barely more than a breath. By the time I opened my eyes, there was no one there. Moments like that bolstered the ghost theory. It was easier than confronting the possibility that my mind was splintering. But I never saw her, never saw any of them, so I lived with them.

My personal ghosts, I called them in my head. Strange how I found that easier to accept than the possibility my mind was slipping. I really did think that's what they were - ghosts - but the truth was worse.

Eventually I made an appointment with my GP. I chalked it up to stress, overwork, exhaustion - whatever label made it sound temporary and fixable. When I really thought about it, the voices had begun around the time I took the new job, around six months earlier. New role, longer hours, heavier workload. Logical connection, right? My doctor seemed to think so. He told me I needed to take some time off work. Get out more. See my family. Relax my brain. See the world. Step away from the social bubble and digital noise. Live in the real world for a while he said. I nodded like I understood, but I didn't really take it the way he meant it. I honestly don't think you would have either, not then.

So I did what he said - sort of. I booked two weeks off. I didn't go travelling; holidays cost too much and I'm more of a homebody. My family? We weren't close. Instead, I saw friends, treated myself to a bit of retail therapy, read books, listened to music and stayed up late watching movies instead of catching up on work. It all sounded healthy enough in my head. No work, no deadlines, no stress. That was the plan. And for a moment I thought I'd cracked it. No voices, right? Wrong. If anything, they got worse. Louder, more persistent. More certain I was supposed to be paying attention to them. I found myself longing to get back to work - anything so I could drown them out a little.

And then there were the times I felt I was living my life like anyone else. Meeting friends, having a laugh, maybe a pint or two. I remember one evening especially. A few mates were joking about their week, someone passed around photos from a recent holiday, someone else telling a story I barely listened to as I slowly consumed more and more alcohol, my head beginning to get fuzzy. A woman caught my eye - pretty, sharp witted. We chatted. A bit of harmless flirting. She laughed at something I said and I felt that old spark of validation. I took her number, but I didn't really intend to see her again. She was just a distraction. Somewhere in the back of my hazy mind, I think Moira muttered something. Nothing outright, nothing you'd notice if you weren't listening for her, and I was always listening. A low, irritated "Unbelievable," or something similar. I brushed it off. Habit, by then.

It had seemed like a normal night out with friends. But it wasn't. I wasn't even dressed to leave the house.

The weekly food shop was the same. I was pushing a trolley down an aisle, comparing prices, being practical. I remember hovering over a head of broccoli, debating whether I'd actually cook it this time. That's when Max piped up: "I don't like that." This wasn't his usual "Play with me?" and it caught me off-guard. Without thinking, I asked him what he did like. Junk food, of course - crisps, biscuits, the kind of thing any kid would go for. And my mind jumped to the id, ego and superego. I'd studied psychology at college and knew a little on the subject. Was this my id begging to be indulged? The child part of me demanding a say? If so then what the hell was Bella?

I decided to feed the id. The junk went into the trolley. The fruit and vegetables stayed where they belonged - on the shelves. "Next week," I promised myself. "I'll be healthier next week." It felt oddly satisfying, like I'd struck a balance between control and surrender. And for a time Max was quiet. Maybe I just had to work out what the other two wanted?

I remember thinking about the voices then - about Moira, Max, and Bella. Were they all parts of me? Ghosts? Hallucinations? I wasn't a hardened sceptic, and I wasn't a blind believer. If they were spirits, they hadn't harmed me. Scared me, sure. But hurt me? No. I figured I could live with them.

Only I wasn't in a supermarket. I was scrolling through an online grocery app. Strange how our minds can play trick like that isn't it? How easily we misremember.

And then, just as suddenly as the had begun, the voices stopped. Two weeks ago, they simply... vanished. Moira's barbed remarks, Max's soft pleas, Bella's endless wailing - gone. I still heard the occasional unfamiliar voice, faint as static, but the main three had disappeared. At first I was elated. The silence was bliss. No more crying from nowhere, no more shadows of conversations lurking just behind my thoughts. That crawling unease that had lived under my skin for months finally eased.

But it didn't take long for the quiet to turn on me. I hadn't realised how used to their presence I'd become. They'd been unsettling, yes, but they'd also been company. Without them, the world felt hollow. Empty. I felt alone in a way I couldn't justify, like something vital had been scooped out of me. Loneliness is a strange thing. You can ignore it when there's noise - when something's filling the gaps. But when the gaps widen, you start to notice the cold.

I made another appointment to see my GP. This feeling wasn't right, it wasn't good and I didn't understand it. And then three days ago, the silence broke - but not in the way I expected. I heard crying again. Bella. I knew that cry immediately, it was carved into my nerves like a groove in brick. For a second I, froze. I couldn't tell where the sound was coming from. Then came Max "Play with me." He sounded closer than ever, and I felt an odd rush of excitement. And then - her. Moira. Except she didn't sound angry this time.

"We need to talk," she said. Not a shout. Not a snap. Just tired.

It was like the thin membrane between their world and mine stretched, then tore. Vision isn't the right word for what came next. It was more like remembering something I'd never let myself consciously know.

I saw the. Not ghosts. Not figments of my fractured imagination. My family.



A woman sitting at the end of a sofa, face drawn with exhaustion, phone in her hand. A little boy with a tablet abandoned beside him, clutching a bright red toy car, his eyes red from crying. And a baby - my baby - strapped into her high chair, cheeks blotchy, mouth wide in an endless wail.

The room wasn't unfamiliar. It was my living room. The wallpaper we'd chosen together. The blanket she loved draped over the arm of the couch. The dent in the carpet where the coffee table had been before we moved it to make room for a playmat.



And then the most horrifying part: me



I was there in the memory - no, in the truth - sitting in the same room but not *in* it. Laptop open. Headphones on. Phone buzzing with notifications. I wasn't looking at them. I hadn't been looking at them for a long time. They weren't ghosts - I made them ghosts. I pushed them out of my world until all I hear of them were echoes. And now they were gone.

That's when the doorbell rang in the present. I flinched, my heart hammering. It was a delivery driver with a parcel I don't remember ordering. Once I'd signed for it and closed the door I saw the envelope again on my desk. The divorce papers. My name. Her name. Custody terms. Mediation dates. Agreements I had supposedly read. My own signature printed digitally at the bottom from weeks ago. I sat down slowly, my phone still in my hand. I didn't even remember picking it up. The doctor was still talking through the screen, his voice muffled by the ringing in my ears.

"You need to rest," he said. "And support is important right now. Antidepressants can help balance your thinking so you can face what's happening. You can't undo it by pretending it isn't real. I know it'd hard, but you have to face up to reality."

I don't remember hanging up, but suddenly the call was over. The silence in the room felt huge. My fingers loosened around the phone and it dropped onto the desk with a dull clack.

That's when I heard it.

Music, faint but unmistakable, coming from a playlist I must have left running on the smart speaker behind me.



"***Don't it always seem to go,***

***that you don't know what you got 'til it's gone***..."

"Big yellow taxi" Joni Mitchell's voice floated through the air like a verdict.

I closed my eyes



My wife - Moira. Not her real name, but the name I'd given to the anger in her voice when she begged me to pay attention. When she said she was right there.

My son - Max. The little boy who wanted to play. Who asked and asked over and over until he stopped asking altogether.

My daughter - Bella. The teething baby whose only language was crying. Who didn't understand why daddy wouldn't look at her.

They were never ghosts. They were never hallucinations. They were moments and memories and pleas filtered through a man who lived more online than in his own house.

They didn't leave because of the stress. They left because of me.

Isn't it funny how your mind can play tricks on you?



So this is my cautionary tale. Not really one of stress - we all have stresses. It's how we respond to it that matters. I urge you to put down your phone, your tablet, close your laptop and engage with the world. Play with your kids. Make memories with them that none of you will ever forget. Spend time in nature, appreciate the beauty around you. Spend time with friends, and talk with them, really talk with them. Sit with your spouse, laugh and be present.

Put down the devices and make time for what's truly important. You can never get that time back.

Follow my advice, and you can have everything you ever dreamed of.



I did.

Until I didn't.
