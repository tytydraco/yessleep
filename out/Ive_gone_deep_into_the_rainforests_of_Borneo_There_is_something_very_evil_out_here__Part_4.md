-

I burst into the main room of the house just as Asri emerges from the other side. He looks tired, still half-asleep. 

“Asri!” I scream, “What the fuck?! There’s a fucking woman outside! And she’s eating him, she’s eating Ketill! She-”

“Stop”, Asri interrupts me, his eyes now wide, “You must leave here!”

“Leave?!” I shout, “I’m not going back out there!”

“You must!” he yells back, “She is coming for you and you must kill her or she will never stop.”

“What the fuck – who the fuck is she?!”

I’m getting angry now. He’s not explaining anything to me. Siti emerges from the room behind him. She looks at me, then to the ground. She appears ashamed.

“She is a hantu – a ghost. She is a demon”, Asri replies, his voice now quieter, “She will come and she will eat you, just as she did your friend.”

“How do I stop her?” I frantically ask, “and why is she after me?”

He walks over with speed to the hammer and nail that sit resting beside my bed, picking them up and pacing over to me before pushing them at my chest.

“You must use THIS”, he instructs me, “in the top of her spine. You must hit her with the nail in the back of the neck.”

I grab the items, hands shaking, before asking, “Why is she coming after me?”

Asri’s eyes dart to Siti who scratches the back of her neck, before his gaze returns to meet mine.

“She is vengeful against men”, he states, “She will kill you, just like- ”

He trails off.

“Just like what?” I ask, “Just like she killed Haziq?”

Asri grabs me by the face, his hands press my cheeks together and he comes extremely close to me, face to face; he is angry.

“She did not kill Haziq.”

My eyes dart to Siti who hangs her head down. I look back to Asri for a moment before pushing his hand away and taking a step back. I look out of the gap in the window; still dark. Although I don’t know what time it is, I can tell it’s not even close to being morning yet – it’s the dead of night.

“Asri”, I say, calmer now, “Asri I can’t go back out there.”

“You must,” he replies nonchalantly, “You cannot bring her in here. She wants you. So you must stop her.”

As he finishes the sentence, the sound of a baby crying sounds through the room. It comes from outside and it is loud; it is close. I stare in fear at Asri. I know that is not the cry of a real baby, not out here. Before I can say anything, Asri forcefully grabs me by the shoulders and drives me out of the front door. It happens fast, in a blink of an eye. I fall backward onto the patio outside and find myself suddenly enshrouded by the night. The hammer and nail land beside me with a thud. I pick the items up and scramble to my feet, running toward the front door but Asri slams it shut at speed. I fight with him to get it open, but he is strong and holds it tightly shut from the inside. I try my hardest to force the door, but am no match for Asri’s strength. I yell at Asri, begging him to let me inside. I hear Asri speaking Malay to Siti from within his house. I can no longer hear the cry of a baby.

Through my groans, through my yells, I almost don’t hear the moan from behind me. It is the same long, croaky moan that I had heard two nights ago. I stop pushing against the door and turn around slowly,

At the top of the stairs, already on the patio, a few feet away; it’s her.

She towers over me, she seems to have grown taller somehow. Her eyes are wide, yet seem dead and expressionless. In contrast to her black shadowy hair, her pale face and white dress glow in the dark as she stands, glaring at me, mouth open wide as she releases a long croak. Her arms stretch to the wooden floor below, bending at the wrists as her hands drag along the ground behind her. Her toes are clenched, clinging hard to the ground, the rest of her feet covered by her gown, which is torn and dirty along the bottom.

I stare at her, frozen.

She doesn’t move toward me; she stands still, eyes locked with mine. She continues to moan, her pitch never changing. Her mouth grows wider with every second. Soon, I see her teeth; dark yellow crooked teeth rest behind her crimson lips. Between her teeth, I see skin, which I can only assume belonged to Ketill. Also lodged within her teeth, however, I see fur – no, hair. Dark hair dangles from her teeth, providing a dark barrier within her mouth. I feel sick as I look at her.

Her mouth continues to open wider. As she continuously moans, blood now spills from her mouth, overflowing, and trickling down her dress. She continues to stare at me, never-blinking. The noise she produces is now a constant, a white noise to me. Soon, her eyes begin to widen too. As her eyelids continue to stretch, her eyes slowly roll back into her head, the whites of her eyes are now all that is visible; however, I still feel as if she stares at me. Just as this happens, my own eyes begin to feel strange. I feel as if they are being pulled, as if- as if they are being sucked out of my head.

I slam my eyes shut and the noise stops.

Silence.

I can’t open my eyes. I don’t want to open my eyes.

I have to open them.

Still silence, only the noise of my shuddered breath fills the air.

I bite my tongue, clench my fists, and open my eyes.

She still stands before me. Although now, her eyes have returned to how they were initially, staring at me lifelessly. Her mouth is shut, and the last drops that had escaped it trickle down her dress. She tilts her head to the side before suddenly walking at me at speed. Her hands drag behind her, splintering the wood with their weight, and being splintered by the wood themselves. She takes long steps and almost appears to cover ground faster than possible with quick spasms of movement.

I turn and throw myself over the side of the railing, falling about 10 feet below.

I land with a thud, my wrist snapping as I do. 

I scream from the pain, tears stream from my eyes. I quickly look to my wrist and can already see bone displacement and the pooling of blood beneath my skin. 

I look back to where I’d just jumped and all is silent. 

I quickly turn my attention to the hammer and nail that had landed close to me, scooping them up and placing the hammer within my trouser waistline whilst my good hand clings onto the nail.

My eyes dart to the staircase on the other side of the house just as she steps onto the first step, coming down toward me. Her feet clench the wood as she climbs down the staircase with impressive speed. Her hands bounce off of each step as she clears them, appearing to break her flimsy wrists with every step. I see her long fingernails now; the ones used to kill Ketill. As she moves down the stairs, blood pours from her mouth which is open once more, wider than before. The sheer amount of blood is astounding, it's impossible; it splashes onto the side of the staircase and now completely covers her dress.

I need to run.

I rush to my feet, momentarily forgetting about my broken wrist and using it to propel myself up, hearing a further crack. I turn and run as fast as I can. I need to make a decision; do I run to the outhouse, try to use that as shelter? 

Or do I run into the rainforest and chance my luck?

Either way, she’s chasing me.
