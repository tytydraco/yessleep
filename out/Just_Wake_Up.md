I jolted awake to the frantic barking of my two dogs, Barkley and Shiloh, their frantic paws pounding against the floor as they leaped off the bed. They raced toward the front door, barking in a frenzy that set my heart pounding in my chest.

“Barkley, Shiloh! Come here!” I called, but my voice trembled, swallowed by the rising tension. They continued their raucous chorus, and then Barkley’s growl cut through the noise, low and menacing. I crept toward the door, my pulse quickening as I peered through the side window. My stomach dropped at the sight of a man dressed in black, standing eerily still, his back turned toward me. A cold shiver snaked down my spine, and I instinctively backed away from the window, dread pooling in the pit of my stomach.

Suddenly, I awoke with a gasp, my heart still hammering. I blinked in confusion; my bed was pressed against the wall, a disorienting change from its usual position in the center of the room. Panic surged within me, and I screamed into the stillness, my voice echoing back.

I woke again, this time to the sound of my horror podcast playing softly in the background. My surroundings felt achingly normal, the soft glow of the lamp casting familiar shadows. My dogs lay peacefully beside me, but the unease lingered, clinging to the air like a heavy fog. “Fuck... A dream within a dream...” I muttered, trying to shake off the creeping fear.

Swinging my legs over the side of the bed, I ordered Alexa to stop the podcast, her mechanical voice providing a momentary distraction. Barkley trailed behind me as I padded to the bathroom, splashing cold water on my face, the chill momentarily snapping me back to reality. My hands trembled, the remnants of terror still gnawing at me.

After drying off, I returned to the bedroom, but froze in horror. A man stood on my bed, his silhouette twisted against the dim light, a sinister smile stretching across his face. My body went rigid, the scream clawing its way up my throat, but no sound emerged. I screamed again, and this time, I jolted awake once more.

Tears streamed down my cheeks as I fumbled for my phone, fingers trembling as I found Ivan’s number. He answered on the second ring, his voice thick with sleep. I struggled to speak through my sobs, begging him to come over. He groaned but promised to be there in 20 minutes.

As I waited, I wrapped my arms around both dogs, seeking their warmth against the creeping chill that had settled in my bones. A little over twenty minutes later, a knock echoed through the apartment. Peeking through the window, I spotted Ivan, a shadowy figure in the night. He smiled sleepily and waved. I let him in and threw my arms around him, sobbing again as the dogs barked excitedly.

Once they calmed, I recounted the strange nightmares. Ivan stood in the kitchen, listening intently, when suddenly a shadow slipped behind him, gliding silently past. It drifted toward the front door, an unsettling presence that seemed to suck the warmth from the room. My breath caught in my throat.

“You saw him?” I gasped, my voice shaking. He nodded, confusion flickering across his features. “Am I still dreaming?” His grin widened, almost mocking, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me.

I screamed awake yet again. “This isn’t happening! This can’t be real!” Desperation clawed at me as I slapped my cheeks, seeking proof of my wakefulness. The stinging sensation felt real enough. Glancing at the alarm clock, I saw it was 2 a.m. Just a few hours since I had fallen asleep. I remember reading somewhere that you can't tell time in your dreams, so I latched onto that small hope.

Looking down, I found only Barkley at my feet. Shiloh often nestled beneath the covers, so I groped around the bed, my heart racing as I realized she was nowhere to be found. Just then, a chilling sight caught my eye—Shiloh being dragged into the other room by a long, slender hand, the door clicking shut behind them.

“No!” I screamed, my voice echoing through the empty space as I rushed into the other room. The room stood eerily vacant, void of any sign of struggle. I checked the bathroom—nothing but silence.

Awake again, I flung the covers aside, frantically searching for Shiloh. I found her curled up at my feet, and I yanked her close, sobbing into her fur, seeking comfort from her warmth.

Outside, a raucous commotion erupted, laughter and music bleeding into the quiet of my apartment. I crept to the window, peering through the curtain. A crowd gathered, reveling in a chaotic party, but my dogs remained unnaturally still, their usual alertness replaced by an unsettling calm. I looked back out just in time to see a figure leap off the third-story balcony, vanishing from view. The sickening crack of bones splintered the air.

“No, no, no... I’m still dreaming,” I muttered, my heart pounding as I paced the room, desperation gnawing at the edges of my sanity. “How do I wake myself up?” I collapsed onto my bed, pulling both dogs close, hoping their warmth would anchor me to reality. Perhaps if I fell asleep again, I would awaken in the real world.

The next thing I knew, I was blinking against the harsh light streaming through the windows. I glanced at the alarm clock: 7:45 a.m. “Dammit! I’m late for work!” Panic surged as I scrambled out of bed, clothes strewn haphazardly in my rush. I dressed in a daze, the remnants of my nightmarish visions clinging to me like a shadow.

After gathering both dogs for their morning walk, I dialed my boss, my voice shaky as I explained my terrible night and my late arrival. “I’ll be there as soon as I can,” I promised, the words feeling heavy in my throat.

Once back inside, I quickly fed Barkley and Shiloh, their eager tails wagging momentarily distracting me from the unease still simmering beneath the surface. I said my hurried goodbyes, hoping the fresh air would clear my mind.

On the drive to work, I replayed the horrors of the night before, trying to stitch together the fragmented memories of endless, terrifying dreams. The mere thought made my hands tremble on the steering wheel, the unease creeping back in like an unwelcome guest. Seeking solace, I called my sister, her voice a soothing balm over the phone. I recounted the surreal events, the chilling figures, and the dread that clung to me like a second skin.

“Listen,” she said, her tone firm yet gentle, “You’re awake now. You’re safe. Just breathe, okay?” Her reassurance was a fragile thread, but I clung to it as I navigated through the morning traffic, the world outside feeling all too real yet strangely distant.

As I pulled into the parking lot at work, a fragile sense of relief washed over me. “It was just a string of bad dreams. You’re fine now,” I whispered, trying to quell the unease that lingered at the edges of my mind.

But as I approached the entrance, reality began to warp and twist, the building melting around me like a cartoon forgotten under a relentless sun. The walls shimmered and dripped, colors swirling into grotesque shapes. Panic surged within me, and I screamed, the sound echoing into the void. “No! Not again!”

And then, with a jarring snap, I woke up in my bed, heart racing, the clock glaring at me in the dim light: 2 a.m.
