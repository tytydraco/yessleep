Do you remember the trumpets in the sky? It happened back in 2012 when everyone thought the world was going to end. The sound of trumpets began blaring throughout several different countries and kept it up for hours. Belgium, the US, Brazil… The trumpets weren’t an entirely unknown phenomenon. There have been reports of them dating back centuries. This one was different.

Hardly anyone who wasn’t there still remembers it, and even those who were have a hard time. It was like no one wanted to talk about it after it happened, like it was a momentary lapse in judgement by the universe and everyone just got on with their day. But I was there. I remember.

The weather was, for all intents and purposes, perfect that day. In a rural part of Iowa, I was out tending to my crops when the trumpets began. My hands were working in the soil, tearing weeds from the ground that threatened to choke my food. I almost fell flat on my ass when I heard it.

It was utterly deafening. The noise came, and for a moment, I thought that a tornado had just popped up out of nowhere and I shot to my feet to search for it. But there was nothing; not a cloud in the sky, and only the slightest of breezes to keep me from melting in the summer heat.

My next thought was that we were under attack. Some foreign country had just waged war with the United States, and backwater Iowa was their first target. But again, as I looked up, there wasn’t any sign of bomber jets or helicopters, or hell, even a commercial plane in the sky. No old chemtrails. No new ones. The world was entirely peaceful, except for that awful playing of the trumpets.

I covered my ears with my soil-wet hands and hurried toward the house. Even with my hands pressed as tightly to my head as I could muster, it barely helped the sound. The harsh, grating noise penetrated all of my senses and threatened to drive me mad. It had only been a minute or two at this point, but it was already too much to bear. I reached my door, flung it open, and shut myself inside.

It was no better there than it had been in the field. I could see my windows vibrating from the noise. I wondered if they would break, if whatever bastards who were doing this had engineered their sound just right to bust in all the windows in America. How long would it take before they burst? Or what about me? Would my ears begin to bleed, would my eardrums explode? What about my eyes? Could a sound even do that? I felt like it could.

The trumpets reverberated through my whole body. It felt like something was inside trying to get out. The floorboards vibrated beneath me and hummed against the drone of the trumpets. My arms quaked as I held my head. I had to find something to stop the noise.

I was a hunter on occasion, only when my eldest wanted to go out to shoot buck. I kept my rifles in a closet by the basement, and there was the rest of the gear, too. I knew I had to get my hearing protection. I stumbled through the house, eyes blurry from the disorientation. Who knew a sound could disrupt your day so much? I tried to keep my hands over my ears for as long as possible before I finally had to grab the handle of the door. I yanked it open and hurried to get my headphones from their case. Inside, I kept a spare pair of foam earbuds as well, so I quickly shoved those in, put on the protection, and slammed the door shut.

It was better, but only mildly. I thought that at the very least I would be able to bear it. The maddening feeling died down. I wasn’t sure how much time had passed then, maybe five minutes, but I certainly had no clue when it would stop.

It didn’t stop, not for hours.

Where I was, it was hard to reach anyone without a landline. I didn’t have enough service to get my iPhone to make calls that sounded any better than the inside of a blender, so I only used it when I was in town. And at this point, with my ears covered and certainly no way to discern what someone would be saying on the other end of the line, I didn’t bother to ring my neighbors. I lived alone, too. No one I could confirm this horrible trumpetting with, no one who could share my experiences. By the first hour, I was starting to wonder if it was all in my head.

I sat at my dining table with my hands clasped and stared out into the field. I could see the glass panes of my windows vibrating around the edges, threatening to jump out. The plants outside swayed softly in the breeze, as if entirely oblivious to the assault. I had no animals that I needed to check on, which I was very thankful for. I don’t know how I could have sheltered a whole farm from this noise.

I remember feeling entirely hopeless. As one hour turned to two, my body shook. I didn’t know if it was nerves or the trumpets. It felt bad, whatever it was. I was trapped in my own home from something I had no power to stop. I had tried turning on the TV to see if anyone was covering the trumpets, but all I got was a blue screen and a warning.

“SEVERE WEATHER ALERT - DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOME - REMAIN INDOORS - WEAR EAR PROTECTION”

Comforting. Made me think that even the higher-ups were oblivious. Did no one know what was going on?

By two and a half hours, I said fuck this. I needed to find someone who knew what was happening. I needed to check if my neighbors were okay, if they’d gotten any news. So, for good measure, I grabbed one of my rifles, hopped in my truck, and headed down the road to Merle’s house.

The man was standing in his front lawn when I got there. I turned down his driveway and headed up to his house, and there, about 30 feet from his front door, he just stood and looked into the sky. His back was facing me, and I couldn’t see what he was doing with his hands on his face. I just knew that I found it entirely strange that he wasn’t wearing anything to block the noise.

“Merle?” I shouted. I could barely even hear my own voice. “Merle!” I knew it was in vain, but I shouted anyhow as I walked up to him with my rifle in hand.

I almost puked when I got to him.

As I stepped in front of Merle, everything I had eaten that day and the last threatened to come up out of me. Blood poured down the front of him, staining his overalls and his wife-beater. His hands clawed at his face as he stared into the sky in abject horror. He had dug deep crevices into his cheeks, and one of his fingers was fish-hooking his eyelid. It pulled downward in a slow yet powerful movement, and I saw the edges of his eyes start to tear. His tear ducts slowly ripped open and cried blood, and the meat under his eyes swelled with it. I could see the entire underside of his eyeball, perfectly exposed to the outside world. I didn’t know how he was still standing.

I stumbled backwards and took in the horror that was Merle. The strip of skin connected to the eyelid peeled down his face and stopped just in the middle of his cheek, or what was left. It disconnected and fell to the ground while Merle raised his hand again and began digging into his flesh once more.

“Jesus Christ, Merle!” I couldn’t even keep the tears out of my eyes. This was most certainly the worst thing I had ever seen. I’d known Merle for many years, ever since I’d moved into the plot of land down the road. The old man had helped me out so many times, and I him. And now he was mutilating himself in the wake of this monstrosity.

I only watched him a moment longer. The amount of blood on his front and pooling around his feet was almost to the point where he couldn’t do anything anymore. It only took a few moments more of clawing and peeling before he crumpled to the ground and lay there, dirt infecting his wounds, blood seeping into the soil.

I got out of there as fast as I could. There was nothing I could do for him. I couldn’t call the police if I’d wanted to – no one would have been able to hear me. Besides, I was certain their lines were backed up with concerns of the trumpets.

I drove my truck down to the next set of neighbors on my road, Jensen and Mary. A happy couple who had just said goodbye to their kids and were empty nesters. When I rolled up in their driveway, I saw the door to their barn was precariously left open.

“Fuck.” I didn’t even know why I bothered talking at that point. The blaring trumpets drowned it out entirely every time. It was no use, but I still did it.

Rifle in hand once again, I stalked toward the open barn. I was far more cautious this time, my guard fully up. I didn’t know what might be waiting for me inside. I should have expected it, really, what with Merle’s condition.

Swinging side to side from one of the rafters was Mary. She was long gone by then, a limp sack of meat dangling from the sky. Her white dress billowed around her as a breeze swept through, turning her body around in a circle. I saw her head. She, too, had nothing to protect her from the noise. It wasn’t like she needed it anymore, though. I wanted to wretch once again, but I kept it down. All I could do was hold it together and try to find Jensen.

The barn seemed empty besides Mary, so I headed for the house. Maybe he was in there. Maybe he was still okay.

The door had been left ajar there, too. It welcomed me invitingly in, so I stepped inside and gripped my rifle tightly. Something was telling me that I needed the safety off, so I listened.

I crept through the house. Maybe I didn’t need to. It wasn’t as if Jensen would be able to hear me coming. I felt the vibrations from the trumpets through the floor as I stalked inside. Everything appeared normal. Nothing was out of place. No blood staining the floors or man clawing off his own face.

I spotted movement out of the corner of my eye as I set foot in the kitchen. Whipping my head around, rifle pointed toward the blur, I saw Jensen crouching in a corner. He was completely naked and curled in on himself, facing the wall, rocking back and forth. I don’t know what possessed me to aim at him, my friend and neighbor, but it felt like the only thing to do. I stomped harshly on the floor to get his attention, hoping he would feel it in the wood. Still rocking, he turned his head toward me and stared.

Jensen had not mutilated himself. Not yet, at least. All that his face bore was a twisted smile. He turned his naked body around, still crouching, and looked up at me. I adjusted my grip on the rifle and shoved it closer to him, a warning. He didn’t seem to care.

And just like that, he came flying at me. In an instant, he shot to his feet and barreled straight for me. I had little time to react as he ran straight into the barrel of my gun, knocking it out of my hands and reaching for me. I was screaming at this point, but neither of us heard it.

His hands found holds on my shoulders and he grabbed me excruciatingly hard. I felt like I was grinding my teeth down to nubs as I tried to keep it together, tried to push him off of me. His wild, deranged face sat right in front of my own. I could smell his hot breath, feel it as he laughed in my face – or, I assume he was laughing. It looked just like it, but of course, no sound could be heard. The man had no ear protection on, and I didn’t know how he could function enough to attack me without something blocking the noise.

We fell to the ground, a naked Jensen on top of me, and began to wrestle. His thumbs dug into my collar bone and I gritted my teeth in pain. My rifle was knocked underneath one of the kitchen counters and out of my grasp, so I had only my body to defend myself. I sent a kick up and into his legs to try to dislodge him, but he just fell against me and kept his hands going. I felt like my collar bone could break at any moment with how hard he was gripping me.

I decided my best course of action would be to try to overpower him. With as much strength as I could muster, I rolled my body and managed to flip myself on top of Jensen. He smacked against the floor but seemed entirely unphased. I struggled to get my hands to his head, but I managed to force past his arms and clasped his skull. His deranged smile hadn’t faltered even for a second and I could still see him laughing at me. Rage had overcome me to a dangerous point, and I knew that it was me or him.

With as much guts and strength as I had, I pressed my thumbs into his eyes. I pressed hard, and I didn’t stop pressing. He didn’t even try to close them as I dug into his skull. His smile remained on his face, teeth glistening up at me. Mouth agape, a laugh jostling his throat – this is how Jensen looked when he died. He didn’t die then and there as I loomed over him, thumbs popping his eyes like grapes. Instead, after the deed was done and I was covered in ocular juices and blood, I tore myself away from him and retrieved my rifle. He didn’t move, but my guess was that was only because he couldn’t see where to go. I raised my rifle and fired a bullet right into his brain.

The only thing that I was happy about, being on Jensen and Mary’s farm, was the fact that they had a decked-out tornado shelter. Mary had always been the worrisome type, and with them having so many kids for so long, she had convinced Jensen that he needed to put in a shelter strong enough to last them days if the weather grew so terrible and they got trapped underground. It had been a small idea in the back of my mind as I drove up to their farm that perhaps they would be hiding inside and that I could join them and get away from the trumpets.

I didn’t even bother to clean my hands when I left. Jensen’s naked, beaten body lay on the kitchen floor, brains blown out and eyes non-existent. Mary hung in the rafters of the barn, breeze turning her around. I made my way to their storm shelter and was grateful to find it unlocked. Rifle in hand, I descended into my sanctuary where I would wait out the trumpets.

It was quieter down there than it had been anywhere else. I was able to wait a few more hours before the trumpets finally ceased. I almost didn’t believe my ears. Carefully, cautiously, I removed the headphones and earbuds and listened to the sound of silence.

I went home soon after. I was expecting the cops to come for me in the next few days, but nothing happened. The news said that the death tolls were still being counted, but apparently, a lot of people hadn’t made it through the trumpets. They were chalking it all up to a case of mass hysteria, that the trumpets hadn’t even been real. Some bozo on FOX suggested that it was the rising rates of mental illness finally rearing its head, or that vaccines had caused people to go crazy. Some said it was judgement day. It took a surprisingly short amount of time for it to leave the zeitgeist, though. After a week, no one said a word about the trumpets.

I remember it, though. No one talks about it anymore, but I remember. I remember those few minutes when the trumpets first blared, before I had anything to block the noise. I remember this voice in the back of my head telling me,

“Wouldn’t it be so nice for it to stop?”
