I enjoyed the Endcreek library; the place had movies in stock for poor shmoes like me that couldn’t afford an online subscription service. It would normally be that sometime around the weekend, I’d go to the local library and pick up an old DVD and although the selection they carried was stark, I’d find something in black and white—the horror ones were always my favorite because they translated to more camp sensibilities with my modern eyes even if that was never their original intentions. All the same, it was something to watch, plus the drive across town got me out of the house. Being on a fixed income fixes a person in place and although I’d have loved to run and jump and hike like so many of the other residents (there were enough trails across the northern mountains for a person to do such a thing) my knees were terrible; sometimes my joints would pop and give out entirely whenever I’d take stairs, so I had to be careful when moving on uneven land. Twenty years ago, I was a linebacker for the Endcreek Screamers, but my body paid the toll. During my time on the team, I’d received two confirmed concussions and the cartilage in my knees deteriorated rapidly when injury compounded alongside a degenerative arthritis disorder. Some nights, especially in Fall and Winter, I would need to rotate heat and ice on my swelling knees. The left one was the worst and some days, my right knee felt as normal as ever. The doctors upstate told me that the pain would vary, but I would need to watch my physical exertion.

Something I will tell you as a person that once went to the gym regularly: you get a little fat. It happens different than with the people that started out fat too. My muscles went flabby; I am not here to make anyone feel poorly about their physique, but exercise, adventuring, camping, hiking—so many things feel like they’ve been taken from me when I dwell in the past, and I walk with a godforsaken cane these days. The doctors upstate told me that by the time I was thirty I would feel fifty; by the time I was fifty, I’d feel a hundred. Of course, I’d since passed thirty and it seemed I had more gripes and pains. I could feel the irksome stabs in my back; it started around the base of my spine and raising out of bed in the morning and reaching down to slip socks over my feet became a battle. Everyone says Crocs are comfortable, but I had no idea.

Chronic pain makes you ignore what might otherwise be a trip to the doctor, but there are so many things I had in my life that brought joy to me that sometimes the pain faded away to a heartbeat in the back of my mind.

Becca was there when I bought my first cane and she’d been there the first bad year when my left knee gave me so much grief that all I was doing was starting fights. There was the part of me, the piece passed on to me by my father, naturally, that wanted me to provide traditionally. Early on—the first year of our marriage—I could not imagine the life we would someday have. When she took on more than expected and became a floor manager down at the fish packing plant, the injury was worse. Disability checks felt like cheating; it felt as though I’d given up; it felt like I was not a man. It went on for months where I became reclusive, drank beer, and became the boogeyman taxpayers imagined. Becca confidently sat me down on the living room couch and asked me what was wrong. 

“I can’t do anything.” I felt small.

“What the hell are you talking about?”

Her words made me feel like a child. I was being a child. “*I’m* supposed to be the one taking care of *you*. You shouldn’t need to work twelve-hour shifts while I sit around and twiddle my thumbs.”

Becca slicked her hair back and removed herself from the couch, rocketing to the small kitchen only a few feet away. Seemingly, she opened and slammed cupboards, but always came up short on what she was looking for. “I didn’t marry a man that feels sorry for himself.” She sighed. “I shouldn’t have said it like that. I didn’t marry you because of what you can do! I married you because there’s never been anyone else that I wanted on my team. You understand?”

“What am I supposed to understand? Huh?” I lurched forward, snatching up my cane (the goddamn thing was never far from reach anyway). “I’m supposed to understand that I can’t give you the things in this life you deserve?”

She was biting her lip, hard, and craned over the kitchen island that separated the meager kitchen from the living room. “I never wanted you to give me anything but your love.”

“Well,” I stammered, “There’s more that you deserve. You deserve more than me. You could’ve gone!” I motioned at my legs. “You should’ve gone.”

“So, that’s what this is about? You’ve just got it all figured out, don’t you? You think you’re supposed to get out of living life because you’re feeling sorry for yourself? You think I care about that? That might be something you’re concerned with, but I am not. If you were going to give up, you should’ve told me sooner.”

“Give up? I’m not giving up!” It was at that moment that I realized I was yelling and reigned my voice in. “You deserve someone better. A better man.” My fist squeezed around the cane handle so that it felt like I might crush the aluminum it was made from. “A whole man.”

“You are a whole man. What ever made you feel like you weren’t?”

“I—” I struggled to come up with a response, “I-I-I.” My gut twisted sick, but it felt true when I said it and it must have been.

“Exactly. *You*.” Becca rounded the counter, placed her hands on my shoulders and raised on her tiptoes to plant a kiss on my cheek before burying her head in my chest. I stared over her head, into the toaster on the far counter and her warmth made my eyesight go. Or perhaps that was the tears; I blinked them back and refused to cry.

“I feel like I’m not good enough and things will only get worse,” I whispered the words into her hair so with each hearty breath the strands fell up.

“I shouldn’t have made you feel that way,” she said.

“You didn’t,” I tried impressing the fact.

“No. I—work is hard.”

“Life’s hard.”

“It sure is.”

I squeezed my free hand around her waist and didn’t want her to go away from me. She pulled me in tighter too. Intimate gasping conversation that echoed between our chests was all that could be heard in the trailer. “It’s really not your fault,” I said.

“Sure it is. Just because you’re dealing with something and work’s got me stressed doesn’t mean I’m allowed to bully you whenever you’re feeling down. I shouldn’t have brought it up like this.”

“You don’t need to be on eggshells around me.”

She shuffled a quick spasmed choke into the place where my shoulder met my bicep; I could not see her face, but I knew she wept. “I should’ve known you didn’t like it. That you had issues with me.”

“How were you supposed to know if I never told you? Besides, I promise, the issue is not you.”

“I mean—the signs were there that all this was bothering you. If I was around more, if I wasn’t working so much then I’d see.”

“It’s not about your job, hon’. This is a me issue. My own dumb brain. You shouldn’t *need* to work as hard as you do. I should be doing it. Not you.”

“That’s a real old way of thinking.”

“I guess it is, I’ll admit.”

“Sexist.” She said the word, but her tone felt light-hearted.

“I just hate to see you come home tired and there I am, sitting on the couch like a bum all day.”

“Then don’t sit on the couch all day.” She prodded my belly button through my T-shirt. “There are things to do around here. If you really want to help me in the ways that matter, don’t be a bum. Clean mama’s house.” She swatted my bottom then placed her chin against my sternum, staring up at me with reddened, watered, gray eyes. There was a pause. “I never want you to call me mama. Also, if you loaf around all day, you’re going to be depressed.”

“Body in motion or something,” I said.

“Sure.”

“All I ever saw growing up was my dad loafing after work. Sometimes he’d fix things.”

She found a grin. “One of the girls down at the plant told me the community center has a free cooking class.”

Becoming a househusband was well out of my depth, but I loved Becca, I loved the idea of what our life could be; more than anything, I owed her for all that she had done for me. So, I tried. Playing for The Screamers was such a natural thing. It felt like a purpose, and with every recipe I saved from social media and every new hobby I obtained (sewing, baking, gardening), I drifted further into depths I never thought I would feel comfortable in. Then came a day—I cannot remember when—where I awoke and did not feel like I was wearing camouflage. I was a man that cooked breakfast for his family every morning, I was a husband that folded his wife’s clothing, and I was eventually a father that loved his children more fiercely than mine ever loved his.

The bulk of my time was spent keeping our home clean; with two young girls running through a singlewide, there was clutter without sufficient space, and there were always questions as they grew. They wanted to know why I kneaded the dough before putting it away to rest; they wanted to know why I liked old horror flicks, and the questions rushed from them whenever it was time for bed. Sometimes, if Becca was working an overnight shift, I would dial her phone, put her on speaker, and let her say goodnight to the girls before I tucked them in. Life shifts, changes, manifests you and your surroundings into unrecognizable things, but for me it was hardly unpleasant. 

Once the girls started school—first Gemma then Elaine—the singlewide became quiet too often in the day. Gardening, although it was difficult to do without much umbrage, I found I had a particular green thumb once I’d crafted a series of boxes around the edges of the deck that jutted out from the backdoor of our home. Although we rented, the old man—he lived in the trailer park as well—said he had no issues with me constructing the garden boxes and screwing into the legs of the deck for sturdiness. I grew tomatoes, squash, beans that ran the length of the deck’s handrails, and sometimes dabbled with herbs too; for whatever reason basil was dastardly.

With the place to myself on the days that Becca worked, I’d venture to the Endcreek library. It was a place that I never gave much thought to before, but our neighbor, that Jeffery Tomes fellow, lived in the trailer park too. Although he was standoffish, he always presented himself in a pleasant fashion; on the occasions that I would bring my daughters to the library, he would chat with them, help them parse through the selection of children’s books, and give them recommendations. A book he gave Gemma was called Abel’s Island; it was quite good. Although Elaine never seemed very interested in reading, he included her in helping him search for books that other people might be interested in.

Most of the time, I went there alone and Me and Jeffery chatted over old horror movies. The old Frankenstein and Dracula are well known, but he turned me onto this old one called The Killer Shrews. It’s old, it’s laughable, it’s racist as hell too, but something in it tickles me. It reminds me a bit of that bad movie from the 70s with the oversized rabbits. It helps that the acting is atrocious.

It was—once the girls were loaded onto the school bus—quiet and peaceful while I sat on the couch and polished off my coffee and hashbrowns; I was still wiping the sleep from my eyes, blinking myself further and further awake in hopes that a lightning bolt might fall from the sky and zap me alive. It was the morning feeling; the feeling like an old engine stirring in the cold. The news came through the small TV on the wall across from me and I could still faintly smell Becca’s perfume from where she’d planted a kiss on my forehead before she left for work. I sipped the coffee. I took a bite of cheesy hashbrowns. I tried to join the world and only after my third cup of coffee did I feel good enough to wash up the dishes everyone had left.

Autumn always sent a chill through the trailer that threatened winter’s coming, so before taking myself from the house, I coated up, pulled a tuque over my head, and stepped outside into the nibbling air. Locking the door behind me, I examined the other rows of trailers spaced evenly apart from one another. For a trailer park, Wooded Alcove was relatively peaceful. Although the news would have a person believe that the east side of town was a deathtrap where yokels might come from the surrounding forest and threaten passersby with banjos, poor folks had a way of living; there’s a reason I see it romanticized too often in books and movies. There’s a brutal honesty to it and a great lie too. The lie that it’s simple and easy. The truth is that we don’t have time to worry about much else besides the moment.

Becca took the Buick and I was left with the jalopy—an Oldsmobile with rusted siding and torn interior. The radio was spotty, but the heater worked. I slotted myself into the driver seat and cranked the heater on full blast while giving the engine a few revs. Then I backed out from the side-yard of the trailer and took off down the gravel drive that split Wooded Alcove into two winding snakes of trailer boxes. Taking down the road, I shifted the heat to the windshield and tried the radio while humming past wooded trees on either side—Back Hill Drive was pretty rural, so it wasn’t strange to come across a groundhog waddling along the shoulder with its rump swaying in the morning air. I smiled at Mr. Groundhog while I zipped past him; checking him in the rearview I personified him in my mind (surely the poor creature was out on a morning stroll, and I’d given him a scare as I whipped past him doing forty-five). 

Wild trees moved with the road and tall unkempt grass pulled at the edges of the asphalt like long fingers.

As I rolled to a stop sign, my cellphone buzzed from the passenger seat, and I glanced at it. It was Becca asking if I’d grab some milk. I responded in the affirmative and before I knew it, I pulled the Oldsmobile into the parking lot of the nearest backwoods general store.

Chip’s had a few antique-looking gas pumps, firewood for sale in the front, kerosine round back, and dim yellow lights illuminated the interior like a painting in the dim blue morning light. The milk was probably expensive at a gas station, but I wasn’t thinking. Milk is milk. Mostly.

I took up my cane from the passenger side and angled myself from the Oldsmobile after shutting the thing off. I’d parked close, near the ice freezer, and the cold crept into my joints. There were the lightning bolts I’d been looking for, stabbing my knees, my back. I gritted my teeth and hobbled towards the glass door.

A bell rang my arrival and stepping into Chip’s was warmer, but not better; the smell of the place was like rotting wood chips, sour BO, something that could not be scrubbed out; beneath all of this I caught a whiff of breakfast food. The man behind the counter stopped mid-conversation with another patron—a balding gentleman with gray sprigs around his ears and a pair of suspenders holding him down. The patron sipped on coffee and pivoted while leaning into the counter to catch a better look at me. They glanced at my cane then back to my face.

“Cold out, innit’?” asked the clerk. Maybe he was Chip.

I tried a smile, “Sure is. Milk?” I asked, while nodding towards the rear of the store where the coolers lined the far wall.

“Yup,” was all the clerk said.

Making my way down one of the narrow aisles, I passed pork rinds, snack cakes, miscellaneous goods covered in dust. Once I’d arrived at the coolers, I examined the dates on the milk and felt sure the half gallon I picked out would suffice.

As I returned to the counter, purchase in tow, I could faintly hear the droning sound of an old Hank Williams ballad, but I couldn’t discern exactly which one—the strained yodeled warbling of the old country singer was the only recognizable thing. The patron was still standing there at the counter, sipping his coffee loudly. The two men muttered to each other, but abruptly stopped when I came around the corner of the aisle nearest the checkout. There was a strangeness in their darting expressions as though I’d caught them doing something bad. Like I was going to tell on them or something. I’d seen the look enough times on my girls to know it. I ignored this and placed the half-gallon on the counter, doing my best to angle myself away from the patron with his coffee cup.

“Three ninety-nine,” said the clerk, without scanning the bar code.

Before I had a moment to withdraw my wallet, the patron sipped loud again, then interrupted my purchase. “Hey! I’ve been trying to place that face of yours! I know you, I think. You used to play high school ball, didn’t you?”

I nodded and placed four bills on the counter. “That’s right.” 

“Goddamn! I knew it was you. Getting a little old, aint’cha?” He looked me up and down before taking another swig of his coffee, but as he turned it up, I heard no liquid; he glanced into the bottom of the Styrofoam cup, shrugged, and shook it at the clerk for a refill. “You were something else. Name’s Billy or something, isn’t it?”

I nodded. “Yeah.” The clerk took my money and deposited a penny onto the counter beside the milk.

The patron nodded. “I think you went to school with my boy. Gerald Roves?”

“I don’t think I know him,” I lied and took my milk.

“You married that white girl, didn’t you?”

“Wha-what does that have to do with anything?”

“Just making polite conversation, that’s all.” The patron shrugged and shook the empty Styrofoam cup at the clerk again; this time, the clerk removed himself from the conversation and darted into the back only to return with a half-empty pot of coffee from somewhere in the recesses of what seemed to be the kitchen.

“Why would you call her that?”

“Whoa there, boy. I didn’t mean nothing by it.”

“I ain’t your fuckin’ boy.” My grip tightened on my cane as I moved to the front door to leave. I’d seen enough people like him to know that it wasn’t worth it. It was morning. I still had the day ahead of me, and I didn’t need to ruin it before it even had a chance to begin.

I could *hear* the smile on the patron’s lips. “I don’t know if I’d be gritting my teeth like that if I’s you. Might snap a tooth.”

The bell jingled as I left, and the cool autumn air caught me. I felt my eyes well up. Not from sadness. Hot red anger. I was breathing heavy, chewing the inside of my jaw for pain to ground me. I did not need to go back into Chip’s and fuck up a dumb old man. I’d half-convinced myself by the time I reached the car and quickly deposited myself within.

“Fuck,” I said into my lap. Then, “Fuck!” came a bit louder and I slammed my fist into the steering wheel.

I turned the engine over and squirted from the parking lot, spitting up dust behind me as I hit Back Hill Drive.

Playing with the radio so that my mind would have something to do, I moved from station to station until I came upon the most local: 96.3 the Rock—it was actually based out of downtown.

I followed the whims of the road, curves, and stops, while I focused on the words of the morning broadcast from the host—a woman named Phyllis (I’m unsure if that’s her real name).

“There are still reports surrounding Berkshire Packing as to whether or not the recent cases of fish washing up on the shoreline has anything to do with The Mayor’s most recent relaxation on the business’s waste removal program. Many of Mayor Brown’s most outstanding critics have said that him looking the other way has been due to the Berkshire families’ healthy donations to his reelection campaign. What do you think of that, Wild John?”

Wild John was Phyllis’s sidekick (sometimes Wild John or Johnny Boy or The Wilderness Man depending on the occasion). Wild John’s voice spilled from the radio next, gruff but playful and nearly apathetic like a stand-up comedian. “I think it’s obvious that the Mayor is corrrrrupt!” He said it in a mocking way, similar to how the tiger mascot said flaky cereal was grrrrreat! “In all seriousness though—and I know we like to have fun on this show—the country’s divide politically hasn’t left our little Endcreek unscathed. Just as there have been larger swaths of people coming out on the furthest sides of the political spectrum on the national stage, it seems the same can be said for our local elections as well. I think Mayor Brown knows what he’s doing and as long as he has the old families of Endcreek, everyone else will fall in line.”

A boowoop noise from the soundboard played. “I’m sorry,” said Phyllis, “I know times are dire. Just thought I’d try and break the tension with a funny effect. It didn’t seem to work.”

Wild John laughed.

[“Alongside those reports, a few of the local teenagers have been sharing photos across social media that show fish washing up on shore with large black mushrooms forming around their gills. Could this be a part of Berkshire’s wonton dumping of biowaste?”](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xsr0yy/it_rots_on_scenic_avenue/)

“You know what?” said Wild John, “I saw some of those pictures, and as bad as I think things are, the pictures looked doctored to me.” He stifled laughter. “Mushrooms growing out of fish. That’s Wilderness John saying: that is impossible. At least, I’ve never seen anything like it.”

A dog barking sound effect erupted from the speakers of my car and then Phyllis cut back in, “Coming up next? The musical stylings of a local up-and-coming band, Radioactive Zombies with their song, It’s Time to End It All!”

Some punk stylings exploded from the radio with a lead singer whose voice was try-hard smooth.

I reached for the knob of the radio and clicked it off, making a mental note to ask Becca about her bosses’ unscrupulous business practices.

That’s when something occurred to me. I’d been driving for some time and still had not reached Hamlet Road that would cut across Old River into downtown; in fact, I’d been on the straight stretch of Back Hill Drive since I’d left Chip’s. Something was off and I did not recognize my surroundings at all; the trees on either side of the road should’ve broken away to the suburbs, but the trees grew thicker, overhung the road, and brushed the roof of the Oldsmobile.

When was the last time I’d seen another car on the road? Minutes. It’d certainly been minutes since I’d seen another car. Instinctively, I reached for my cellphone in the passenger seat and checked the time. It was just past nine. Returning the phone to its seat, I snatched at the radio knob again, but now only static came through. Twisting the knob in hopes that I’d find a signal, little bits of gibberish language came out in spurts until finally, static filled the car and I shut it off again. With a hearty sigh, I squinted ahead; since when did a fog roll in?

The fog was thick, and the trees were thick, and I felt the beginning of a creep up my spine but jostled in my seat to settle my nerves. It was nothing. I reached for the brights and flicked them on; this only made it more difficult to see through the fog, thickened it like gravy, so I shut the them off and craned forward in my seat, nose hovering over the steering wheel.

I reached for the crank of the driver’s side window and rolled it down just a crack. Cold cold air entered the Oldmobile and I could hear nothing through the fog. There was the hum of the engine, the tires on pavement, and my own breathing. Without trying, my foot weighed on the gas, and I tried to see what might come next through the fog. There was road and road and road and then something else too. I eased onto the brakes and came to a slowed halt in front of a shadow in the fog. It was wide and angular and upon my approach, the shadow shifted around like a darkened blob against canvas. Then I rolled further, and it came into view.

It was a buck with wild malformed horns; it stood in the center of the road, directly across the center line and stomped a hoof onto the pavement before turning to look at me. I’d come to a full stop, hands latched onto the steering wheel like they’d atrophied there. The buck swayed on its hooves, lolled its head around. I could scarcely see the finer details of the creature, but it staggered forward in a weird haphazard fashion before raising its head over the hood of the Oldsmobile. There was something wrong with it. The poor thing’s neck protruded in a way that should’ve marked it dead. It was as though its body tried balancing its head on the end of a string. “What the hell?”

Upon further inspection, I could make out the whiteness of its eyes. And the blackness too. Flies buzzed around its antlers. No. Not flies. It was a mist or strange lively spore. I reached for the crank on the window and rolled it shut. “What the hell’s the matter with you?” I asked it through the windshield.

It did not answer. Obviously.

The buck wobbled around to the driver side of the Oldsmobile, clambering its antlers against the front left tire. It raised its head and seemed to look at me. Milk white eyes with flecks of black rot corroding its edges.

I felt my arms grow weak as I stared at the creature through the glass.

I took in a great breath and just as I did so, the buck erratically pulled itself onto its hind legs and slammed the driver’s side window. Spiderwebs shot across the glass, and I let out a scream. The creature landed on its hooves again in a messy scramble and fell onto its front knees.

Without hesitation, I gunned the engine and sped away, only catching the briefest of glimpses of the thing in the rearview through the mess of fog as it danced into a standing position. “Jesus Christ,” I hushed to myself over and over like a mantra.

The road took me and took me.

The further I drove, the darker the world around me grew, and I was forced to go no faster than twenty in trepidation that I might come across another horrifying buck. If I went any faster, I was afraid I’d slam into whatever came next. I could not see. The white fog subsided and was replaced with black shadows, dark and hard.

Glancing at the gas gauge, I sighed a sigh of relief. At least I’d filled up the day prior. I could’ve driven for miles if the road demanded.

With each mile down the stretch of Back Hill Drive I began to slip further from what I’d call reality. The trees started changing first. Their branches stretched over the road in arches, craned down to scrape the outsides of the Oldsmobile, threatened to slouch further, and took on an ethereal stretched quality as though they might snap from the trees like glass shards. Pine trees, Birches, disgusting thick Oaks morphed and swayed in druggy ways. I blinked so as to be sure that nothing interfered with my vision, but things did not change. In fact, they only grew worse as the morning sun was snuffed out from the canopy of trees and the whistle of them going by drove me mad. I slowed further and that was the first moment that I noticed something woosh by in the haze of greenish blot colors. It rocked the Oldsmobile on its axles, and I shook my head, scanning the rearview for whatever had passed me. Was it another car? I held my breath. Was it the deer?

The thing, whatever it may be, darted in front of the hood of the car, missing it by milliseconds. My hands held onto the wheel of the car in repeated squeezes, my chest heaved, and I counted seconds if nothing else to calm my nerves. It passed again, little more than a blur and totally indistinguishable. It could not have been the buck from before. It was something more otherworldly.

My gaze shot to the speedometer and upon noticing that I’d slowed to a meager fifteen miles-per-hour, I slammed onto the gas with my foot, all of the aches and pains in my body long gone; I wasn’t even me, because I was a different person—my head pounded to the point that I could feel the pulsating veins beneath my skin; my neck muscles clenched and I ground my teeth together. *I don’t know if I’d be gritting my teeth like that if I’s you. Might snap a tooth.* I slipped my tongue between my teeth while slamming my hands against the steering wheel. I needed to compose myself. My whole body was tight, coiled like an iron spring. Something was wrong. There was fear, fight or flight, but there was something else too. A thing far more nefarious. It was the liminal emotions between build-up and release. A place I wished to be and a place I’d come from. I was stuck in the midst of a panic attack, and I wanted to cry. The Oldsmobile’s engine roared as I reached over forty and the trees whizzed by.

The blurry entity returned, attempting to dart in front of the car again and I punched the horn with a half-open hand; I must’ve startled the thing, because I watched as the thing disappeared beneath the hood of the car. The tires smash over it while I bumped around in the driver seat. The rearend of the car swerved as I maintained a steady hand on the wheel. I heard screaming; it was me who was screaming. I’d killed it. I must have killed it. I ran it over and it was dead; that was the end of that, surely. I laughed maniacally and it scared me.

Tears welled in my eyes, and I felt my body relax.

The trees blocked out nearly all light and the road grew tumultuous with crags and potholes testing the springs of the car; I was in a tunnel of nature. Steam bellowed out from under the edges of the hood, and I felt my stomach leave through my bottom.

“No!” I wailed. The normally manageable aches returned in full force, storming up from both knees to my spine, and spread to the tops of my kidneys. It was all too much and I defeatedly clenched through the spasm my body was having as the Oldsmobile rolled to a stop in the center of the road. Only pinpricks of light pierced the foliage, and I was somewhere else. Not among the living. Assuredly, I’d left Chip’s and driven directly into Hell.

The last few sputters exited the exhaust before the car died completely and I was left there in the driver seat in the dark, the quiet, the miasma of burning rubber. Reaching for my phone, I shook its flashlight alive so as to gather my cane and rummage around in the glove compartment for anything that might potentially keep me safe if any more of those creatures arrived; I found nothing and slammed the glove compartment closed with an angry plastic click.

I stared at the steering wheel for minutes, rocking back and forth to rile myself into a fit. Once, I was Billy Williams, captain of The Screamers defense. I closed my eyes and focused on being tough. I wanted to be tough. With my eyes closed, I could picture a stadium shouting, the cheerleaders rocked their pompoms, and I peered out from the caged recesses of a football helmet; my heart pounded. When I opened my eyes, it was dark, and I was alone in my car. I was aging. I would be decrepit and twisted. I was scared beyond belief.

“Fuck that!” I said to myself. “You’ve got this. You’ve fucking got this.”

I latched onto the doorhandle and propelled myself forward, cane in one hand, phone lighting my feet in the other. More than anything, I was immediately met by the quiet of the surrounding thick trees. Scarcely, I could make out the noises of my own shoes shuffling around the edge of the Oldsmobile. Reaching the front of the car, I held my phone in my mouth awkwardly and felt around beneath the hood for the latch. As I did so, each breath passing between my lips forced a shudder from me; try as I might, I could hear no other sounds and I was certain I was being stalked by something in those woods.

With a groan, I unclicked the hood and fumbled with my phone.

Giving the hood a heave, I stumbled back on my heels in disbelief.

There was no engine. I stared directly through the wide-open compartment, to the pavement beneath the car. I blinked and craned forward. Just to be certain, I lifted the cane and jabbed at the open air where the engine should’ve been, only for the rubber end to meet the hard ground. “No.”

Yes. It was gone. No snapped wires, no battery, just nothing. No evidence that anything was ever there.

In a few panicked steps, I rounded the vehicle to look at the backside. Had the whole engine fallen out of the car? That was impossible.

The overhead pinpricks of light faded and then there was only forest and road and a dead Oldsmobile and me.

I threw myself into the front seat and slammed the door before dialing the police, Becca, anyone; I began punching in random numbers. There was no service.

Entirely defeated, I stared through the windshield, down the road where I couldn’t see a thing. I examined the rearview where I couldn’t see a thing.

After little debate, I gathered whatever courage I had left, pulled my tuque tight around my head and began walking back in the direction of Chip’s. I’d longed for an adventure, the opportunity to hike. So, I had it.
