I've been an orphan for nearly 12 years. As I write this, I'm 24 years old and recently finished my bachelor's in nursing. My upbringing was typical for the most part, aside from a few awkward interactions and the lack of a father figure for the better half of my life. But normal nonetheless. My father died when I was three. My mother always said it was from a broken heart; come to find out, he had a bad history of high cholesterol. My mother wouldn’t pass until I was 12; the circumstances surrounding her death are insidious, and her death is why I'm sitting here writing out the contents of my mind. I know whoever reads this will most likely not believe anything that I'm about to exposit. But that's not the reason I'm writing this, and, to be completely honest, I don't know why I'm taking the time. Maybe it's a form of therapy or an attempt to write out the vestiges of my past. But what I do know is that things are starting to get weird again. I feel it lurking in the shadows. Watching, waiting for me.

I was born and raised, or at least until 12, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Later, my mom would get a new job in Connecticut, necessitating a move. We moved in late May after school let out for the summer. I had just finished 7th grade and was excited to finally wrap up Junior High. The move was sudden but not entirely unenjoyable. Of course, I enjoyed my friends in New Mexico, but I was always excited for a new adventure. My mother always said I had a curious spirit. My sister, only 2 years younger than I, whose name is Silvia, was less excited about this move; she was throwing an awful fit at the time. However, my mother was her own force of Nature and would not be hampered by the misgivings of a 10-year-old girl. The move itself took about 1 week, and on the last day, we packed into my mother's four-seater station wagon and followed the movers all the way to Connecticut. The drive was long, made longer by my sister's constant complaining, crying, and, all in all, being a headache. We finally made it to the new home on June 1st.

The house is a two-story, ranch-style abode with black shingles and white filigree covering the exterior. It was located about 2 miles outside a small Connecticut town called Newberry. The house qualified as an acreage, given its location and the amount of land that came with it. My mother was a veterinarian, and I would later find out that this came with the job.  The house had a nice, large front porch with deck chairs already waiting outside. I can honestly say I was thrilled when I found out exactly where we were moving and how grandiose the house looked. I didn't expect something so gorgeous. My sister and I both decided to move up to the second floor, where there are two separate rooms.  Because I was the older sibling, I, of course, took the larger one. The room was more spacious than my sister's, but nothing too opulent. I quickly assumed that this room was either an office or some form of storage, because a desk was already inside. The desk was made of hard, black lacquered chestnut wood. It almost seemed like a relic of the past, standing out from the rest of the home. The only other stand-out feature of this room was a large rectangular vent that rose from the floor in the back-left corner. The vent seemed almost as old as the desk could have been. The vent had a large iron frame over it, its zigzagging pattern closing it off.

The first night in the house was peaceful; my sister had seemingly calmed down from her prior tantrum, and my mother thought it would be fitting for us to eat in and have pizza. After my mother and sister finally settled down for bed, I decided it would be a prime opportunity to sneak outside and see exactly what the night was like here. I always enjoyed the outdoors, and with it being summer, I thought this would be an excellent opportunity. The night summer air felt comforting on my skin. The sky above me was cloudless, with a large pale blue moon hanging low.  The moon's brightness seemed to drown out the rest of the stars in the sky.  I wandered the front yard of the house, feeling the soft grass on my bare feet. The trees surrounding the house rustled slightly in the summer breeze.  I made my way around to the back of the home. The scenery was almost no different from the front, but one feature seemed to stand out. There was a small rectangular storm cellar that appeared to be built into the back of the house.  It lay horizontal on the ground, two large wooden doors covering its maw.  I had seen Storm Cellars in my life, but none like this.  The wood seemed rotted, damaged, and time-worn. And for some reason, it drew my attention completely.

I don’t remember moving to the cellar doors.

One moment I was standing still, and the next my feet were sliding through the grass, slow and heavy. It felt as if my body were moving through water while my thoughts floated along somewhere behind it.

The closer I got, the tighter my chest became. A deep, crawling tension that settled beneath my ribs. It grew with every step.

The doors filled my vision. Their wooden frames, like eyes, seemed to watch me back.

My breathing had changed. Short, shallow pulls of air that never quite felt finished. Like a quiet suffocation.

Just a look, I thought. The words felt empty. Unconvincing.

My hands lifted. I didn’t tell them to. I watched them rise in front of me, fingers trembling slightly, hovering there as if waiting for permission I hadn’t given.

They touched the wood.

It was colder than I expected. Damp. The surface gave a little beneath my palms, soft with rot and age. I should have pulled away then. I knew I should have.

Instead, my fingers curled.

I pulled.

Nothing happened.

I pulled harder. The wood groaned faintly, but the doors didn’t budge. My grip tightened until my knuckles burned. I don’t know how long I stood there, tugging again and again, my arms aching, my breath coming in ragged bursts. Time lost all meaning. I was a cell in a larger body—a drone completing a task.

Frustration welled up inside, sharp and overwhelming. It didn’t feel like mine. It was someone else's, something else.

Open, something inside me urged. Not a voice. Not a sound. Just a need. A compulsion.

Then, just as abruptly, it stopped.

My hands fell away from the doors. I stumbled back a step, gasping, the night air rushing into my lungs as if I’d been holding my breath for far too long. Awareness seeped back in slowly, like feeling returning to a limb that had fallen asleep long ago.

I didn’t look at the cellar again.

 It wasn’t until I returned to my room that I realised the damage I had done to my hands. Blisters and splinters riddled my epidermis. The discomfort was dwarfed by the sheer terror of losing my self-control. I attempted to calm myself. I was always told I had a hyperactive imagination, and this could be no different. I was right to be afraid; something had me in its sights, and it wanted out.
