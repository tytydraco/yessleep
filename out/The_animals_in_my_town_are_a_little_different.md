I would like to start this off that I am not a big animal nerd, I didn't really go to the zoo as a kid or anything like that so maybe that's why I accepted the way these... things looked for so long. I also live in an entirely different state than the one I grew up in because this was the only job hiring fresh out of college graduates instead of some 6 month internship that might lead into a job. However, after talking to some family members I realized that I might need to share this with the general public. No one in my town seems bothered but maybe one of you can give me some pointers on what to do.

As stated above, I moved here right out of college, got a great deal on apartment through Craigslist. Some guy (who we'll henceforth call Kenny) was looking for a roommate because his parents decided to stop paying for his entire rent. Since he didn't want to pay the surplus, he was looking for a roommate. I had disposable income like never before and happily moved in. Only draw back was dealing with Kenny's ridiculous dog, Bubsy. The thing is massive, could be a horse for a small child, smells god awful and is obsessed with licking everything.

I avoid it at all cost. Kenny promised the dog wouldn't bother me, but of course it does. So I started avoiding going home. I'd eat out, go to the gym, or walk the park which leads to the collection of stories I have now.

The park is nice, I go there the most cause I'm a lazy fuck and would rather chill on a bench then exercise. Plus, it's not really muggy or filled with bugs and mosquitoes like back home. In fact theres almost no bugs, every season here is perfect. Fall is chill, winter gets only a little snow, spring has flowers but very little pollen, and summer never gets too hot. After the first few times I went to the park, I noticed there was plenty of animals in the park to watch, something I never found interesting until I moved here. They all interact with one another and if you watch enough you notice which animals get along, which hate each other, and which hunt each other.

I've started to carry snacks for the friendlier ones, I also thought it'd be a little funny to show favoritism and maybe cause problems between the animals. Call me a sadist all you want, watching critters fight over a piece of popcorn is hilarious. 

The first ones I started to feed was things that I identified as squirrels. Though I'm not sure that's what they are now. They came up from the ground, had those bushy tails, beady evil eyes, horns, and long snouts. Usual stuff, it's not like I haven't seen animals with those traits before. Every time they see me coming they let out these squeaky screams to summon the others. They like to sit on my knees or shoulders or next to me on the bench as they eat. There's been a few times I've brought less food than usual and seeing them bunt heads to fight over portions. Entertainment at it's best.

I think they know I have been holding out on them though. I've been seeing a lot of them watching me from trees or telephone wires as I go around town. When I bring them more food now, they'll bring forth trinkets: jewelry, coins, toys, etc. One time they brought me a finger and that earned them less food as punishment. What am I supposed to do with a finger? I think they're starting to understand that if I like the trinkets they give me, I'll buy them better food. I didn't know animals were so smart, especially since Bubsy can't even be taught to sit.

The other animals that have been friendly was the birds. There's multiple different kinds but the ones that I usually feed are these black birds. They have long legs, sharp teeth, and tiny wings. They're pretty creepy, never seen birds without beaks before but whatever. They always look like they're smiling and I have to be careful when feeding them. The guy at the bakery I frequent said that they bit his pinky off because they got confused.

When they come around I feed them by tossing food to them. I refuse to hand feed them like I do with the squirrels. Plus they're less cute anyway, I think anything with multiple legs is a little freaky looking. I don't think they're as smart as the squirrels which makes sense. I've heard birds are stupid. But they're nice enough. Notice things I don't.

Any time I feed the few that are around the park they talk like fortune cookies. 

"Stay away from alley ways" one said when I gave him a Slim Jim, then later that week I saw a news report on someone getting shot in a mugging gone wrong in a alley I use as a short cut on my way home from work.

"Open your heart to new beginnings," said another when I gave it the rest of my burger from a mom and pop place. I'd been getting over an ex from college who had cheated on me and the whole experience made me swear off dating for a while. After the fortune cookie-esque advice, I started trying dating again. I found a guy from the gym after I nearly killed myself on the bench press and we've been dating ever since.

I don't think it's too out of the ordinary, it's just a little different. Like I said, no one in my town is bothered by these things. Kenny has told me not to feed the animals but he also thinks the earth is an egg and that his dog's licking is adorable. 

Oh and I think Kenny's been letting the dog into my room at night. That or the dog has figured out how to open and close doors. Last night I awoke to him licking my feet, feeling his teeth nawing on the tips of my toes for the treat that was yellowed toe nails. Maybe I was cruel but I kicked him away and tucked my feet under the blanket before I went back to sleep. Course when I woke up the next morning my door was shut like no one had been there. I'm unsure how to confront Kenny about it though.

Anyway I should probably get back to work, I've been typing this out at a meeting we've been having. If I think of any other stories of note or you all think the animals are as weird as my family seems to maybe I'll post again.
