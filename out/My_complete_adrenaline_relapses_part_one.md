"Well, I can't believe that I'm posting here but at least none of you will believe me or at least think I'm crazy I, I'm adrenaline addict I have done many serious idiotic things in my life or what some might call my past life which for some reason that I still remember which isn't fun because of the last memory."

"If you don't mind I would not like to talk about that part, as it might involve a gut shot and then me urinating on myself not a good memory, and anyways that was then and this is currently now and me in war zones doesn't really matter in the now what really matters is my idiotic friends trying to do exactly what I did, and I get dragged along because I'm the man that you go to when you need to get into places you're not supposed to and also I know where to get booze."

"I guess that's what you call the perks of being reincarnated you still remember how to do things that you shouldn't, but anyways but to be honest I did a good job I didn't go searching for an idiotic adrenaline rush and just they tried to keep it like you know a normal teenager that's of 17, throwing parties kissing a number of people and maybe sleeping with a couple of them as well."

"Then one of my friends poses the ideal hey you know that old legend about that factory containing a spirit, (Forget the spirits name currently.) yeah let's go there and try to find out if it's real or not, this friend's name is Timothy and even though he's 6 foot muscular black hair and green eyes and looks like the perfect dude to get into football, he chooses to spend his time looking for an adventure and even though it took a little while of convincing them all to go there he did and the rest of them just peer pressured me saying if I didn't help them and they got caught I'd be blamed."

"Of course, it was jokingly but still I knew that they would be slightly mad at me for not helping so I went along with them and please understand that this is a small area, in a location I'm not going to talk about as I don't want to see more idiots encounter this thing but it's small enough where legends are easy to spread and we even have our own male witch doctor or something like that, and they've been all over the place but even they have told me and my friends never to go there."

"The factory was at a 60 or 70s cast iron pot factory, and they made pots and pans for several reasons most notably about the location though was this several accidents, the people fell into hot iron people had machines clamp down on their hands and there were the rumors of the crying, went from everything between a banshee and a white woman I can say that it was none of those things."

"Well, me and him got there and began to waited for the others, a girl named Mary another dude named Oliver and another girl named Lindsey and then the night begins like usual us beginning to drink and party in an area that we weren't supposed to others playing with the tools that would lay around I just sat on top of a big metal pot, used for holding melted iron that could be put inside of the molds, and that's when all of us would begin to hear the crying."

"At first, we thought that someone was just trying to screw with us and the other shouted while I just chuckled and then rattle started to come from the door and that usual ghost type activity and I noticed that the hairs on my arm had begun to stand up and I started to feel heat from one of the giant pot that I was sitting on, I would quickly jump off of it looking at it starting to turn red and the couple of the other pots would begin to turn red as well the heat coming off of it felt like... Standing in front of a tank that got hit with a phosphorus round."

"Then that's when we noticed it some crying woman slash man thing they started to come out of that pot and would grab Lindsey like it was in distress Lindsey's arm, with begin to know to the bone and she would just begin to scream and all of us would smell pork chops or steak being roasted the others will discuss the but my mouth began to water, not only that I felt something that I hadn't felt in a long time that rush of almost being able to die, one of them quickly grabbed salt and threw it at the creature which just backed inside of the pot, and then I would take away the salt quietly, and begin to surround the pot with of the salt which seemed to the creature more upset at me."

"This is why I'm posting right now as I know that I'm going to go back there and I'm probably going to do something very stupid involving that crypted which right now I'm calling them a melted poltergeist, and also getting ready to lie about the serious damage to Lindsey's arm listening to my muscle bound your friend is trying to get everyone on the same page as Oliver is just saying that we need to tell the government or the authorities as Timothy chastises him, oh and by the way my name is Corey"

"God dammit I begged them to let me out of the car and for some reason I'm going back to that damn pot factory, but I didn't go back without getting the items that Mary had brought along with her as she is a religious type apparently and had brought several items silver net metal net made out of iron and a bunch of salt and for whatever reason a net that had several knots in it as she said that was for vampires, but it still gave in somewhat of an ideal it's just I was going to have to contact some people that might end up putting the barrel to my head for whatever this creature was instead of pay me but then for a second the witch doctor flashed into my mind."

"When I approached the door, I texted them, so I didn't hear them cursing at me and I just told them of everything that had happened engine feel the water bottles up with salt and poured one of them down the rope net soaking it with salt water, when I opened up the door and approach the giant pot the salt line was covered up with iron which in response made me grunt a little but I knew it wasn't going to be this easy, and I knew that I was completely underprepared so I would just put my back against the wall and get ready or whatever attack was coming my way beginning to hear the moans come closer, as well as the sound of that stretching and popping when metal gets very hot, and then I would start to feel the heat above my head before I would jump forward losing a good grip of the net, and a couple of the water bottles as they flung from my pocket."

"I am about 5'11 now and have decent muscle but none of that prepared for being next to something so hot even getting shot in the gut didn't prepare me for it and I flinched just swinging the net forward onto, it didn't expand like it should have and hit it sideways, but salt water did wonders, and it began to cool down rapidly screaming trying to wrench the screaming net away from itself the water would evaporate immediately, giving me to sprawl my body out long enough and grab a hold of another water bottle full of salt opening it up and dumping it on the creature making it cool enough for me to wrap the rest of the net around it and drag it to a vat of water dumping it in and inside of the water, before putting all of the salt that I had with me into the water and as I sit here typing away still I'm wondering why did I ever stop trying to chase after this thrill, and then I remember I was shot and now I'm just waiting here for that which doctor if they have a solution."
