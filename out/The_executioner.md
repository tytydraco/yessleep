The wooden grip fits perfectly in my hand as I press the cold steel against his head. The hammer—so familiar—rests beneath my thumb. I pull it back, feeling the weight of the moment.

The trigger resists, just slightly. I push.

**Bang.**

He falls, crashing into the dirt.

That makes six.

I flip open the cylinder, slotting in six more. **Tonight will be long.** This motion is second nature, practiced hundreds of times.

As I reload, I wonder how I got here—how I became nothing more than a tool of execution.

The next man steps forward.

This man is different.

Familiar.

I’ve seen his face before—maybe in a life long gone, a past buried and forgotten. But still, something lingers.

He falls to his knees. 

I press the barrel against his head.

He starts screaming—pleading—swearing he's innocent, that he’s done nothing to deserve this.

I don’t think long.

I squeeze.

**Bang.**

He falls.

I think once more.

How did I get here?

How did I go from a kid with dreams to this—a cold machine, no heart, no soul?

Just the weight of the revolver in my hand.

Just the cold steel.

 Dreams of being an artist—

Now replaced with faces screaming in the shadows.

The cold wind howls in my head, carrying the echoes of the ones I’ve laid to rest.

Cold.

Cold.

My heart is ice.

Six years of nothing but *bang*—and reload.

Before I go mad with reminiscing, the next man comes.

He kneels before me.

I hesitate—just for a moment.

Then, I press the barrel against his head. The cold steel reminds me of my soul.

The ice in my chest spreads.

I squeeze.

**Bang.**

My paintbrush replaced by cold steel, my canvas now the nameless faces that fall before me.

My mind goes wild once more, but not with thoughts of paintbrushes and canvases—

but with something else. Something cold. Something dark. Something leading to the void.

I tighten my grip on the wooden handle. Not yet, but soon. Yes.Before the thoughts of the void can consume me, the next man comes.

He falls to his knees.

I press.

I squeeze.

Bang.

He falls.

The revolver feels heavier in my hand, the cold steel colder than usual. I look down at the man. Nothing new. Nothing different.

How many times have I pulled the trigger? How many times have I reloaded? How many times have I pulled the trigger? How many are dead tonight—six? Maybe more, maybe less. It doesn’t matter. It never did.

The next man steps forward. I press. I squeeze.

Bang.

My paintbrush is gone, replaced with my revolver. The gun cold, metallic. My canvas, the nameless faces. The family destroyed.

I never should have gone into this line of work.

The next man steps forward. My paintbrush, ready to meet the canvas.

I press. I squeeze.

Bang.

He falls.

I reload. Six more. There will always be six more.

I close the cylinder.

 I lift the gun. I press.

But there is no next man. No one kneeling. No one waiting.

Just me. Just the cold steel. Just the weight in my hand.

I squeeze. Bang.

The gun clatters to the dirt. The cycle ends.
