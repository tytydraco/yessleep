During the dead of night, a crowd of people drum their way around our neighborhood. It's nothing but monotonous bangs. 

It's occasional, so not many will acknowledge having heard them even after a year in the area. One day I asked my bro about it and he affirmed it, but our other family members were oblivious to it.

They come from down the farm, where it's dangerous to come in moreso at night since it's all bushy and overgrown. 

They either enter our, or the neighbor's side and they do a walk in close to our houses. We have a backyard gate which is a couple yards from our house so they don't get so close to our house.

I'm positive they get to that gate and drum for a few minutes around the place. I reside in a village with lots of trees and not many residents have access to power, so it's almost always pitch black. 

The first time I heard it I wondered, "is it me or that drumming is getting awkwardly close, so close I think it's in our backyard. I was scared shitless since it sounds like a large group of people from the movement. They do nothing else but drum; no singing, no chanting or ranting. 

What you can tell is they are dancing or shuffling their feet to the absurd rythm. I wanted to wake people in the house but I was frozen by how close it was getting I couldn't imagine the others wouldn't be woken in their slumber. 

It was silent all of a sudden. Then it was all gone. Weird thing is they don't drum their way out and you don't hear the crowd movement like when they come in. Almost as if they vanish at the spot.

"They come up to our house and we have to barricade the door with everything in the house that's heavy enough. First time it happened, we were hysterical." A girl who once rented our neighbor's backyard guest house told us after we asked her if she ever experienced the thing. She lived with her mother and there was no gate nor fence separating their house from the farmside. So she said the drummers matched outside their premise.

"First time it happened my mom and I almost lost it. We didn't know if it was an assault or a crusade. All it makes you think is if you are safe. And you want to stay quiet because you notice it is a huge crowd very huge. Almost over a hundred in number clogged all around the house. And th drumming? Deafening..."

Another weir occurrence is there's a sequenced tinging sound from the right of our yard at around 2am. My dad and I are the only ones who've experienced it. I have 2 or 3 times in span of two years. My neighbor is oblivious to it and I am sure it originates from their yard. 

I was stargazing whilst enjoying a smoke when that eerie tinging begun. It has  practiced sequence. Hard to replicate so it must signify something. It's not as loud as the drummers. Making all strands stand on all threes is what they share in common. Disturbing, very, they are.

Another thing is they stop almost suddenly and you can tell when they begin and setup but after they stop, it's like it never happened. What's more alarming is the long-term residents are oblivious to it. And they are audible. 

So it's either they hypnotize and one is put under a spell where they become desensitized to hearing it. And if so and I am converted by those melancholy tunes, the world will know about it. Someone will find this and if you are ever in this situation, probably you will be in this village. Village I personally call Resident Evil.
