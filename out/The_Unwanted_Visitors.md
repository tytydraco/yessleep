They say that in order to invite an evil entity into your home you first have to do certain rituals like playing the Ouija board, trying to do a séanse to speak to the dead or even grab a cool looking amulet you found on the street. Every so-called “expert” will have an explanation as to why these things are happening to you. Bad energy you picked up from the cemetery? Stepping on a place where someone died? Hell even the bit of dirt that got stuck on your shoe after you buried your grandma, aunt or anyone for that matter. 

But what happens when none of the above are the cause of your wretchedness? What if all of a sudden they just decided to show up. 

I don't like to go into details as many do so I'll give you a quick bit of context. Although with all that's been happening I don't think it can be that short no matter how many details I leave out. 

Back in 2020 it was just my mom, me and my sister. I was 20 and my sister 19. Mom was a relatively young mom so we got along pretty well. My dad on the hand was a piece of shit to say the least. He never talked shit or anything but he was the type to ignore us all and fall asleep on the couch after having one too many. He might've as well not been there at all. 

One day(and no I'm not a conspiracy theorist) he went to the hospital after trying and failing to repair a piece of wall that had cracked after experiencing 3 earthquakes the same day on September 19. All he did was break his hand. How? I don't even know. 

That same day the hospital gave us the news that my father had died due to covid complications. We had no chance to even bury him. They gave us his ashes and we didn't even keep them. We left them at the hospital inside some trash can. It might sound harsh but like I said; there are details I would rather leave out. He's dead so fuck him.

Both mom and I did home office and my sister studied so it's not like it hit us much.

Fast-forward to one year later, everything went as expected. Everything was ok.

Until it wasn't. 

My family and I didn't have movie night or game night or anything. We were close enough to not need any bonding session like many people do. But that night we decided we wanted to watch a movie mom found in a garage sale. She was told it was the most boring long crap he ever had the misfortune of watching. He explained it was a special edition so he could only give a 5 bucks discount. It was the extended version of the Lord of the rings. The three of them. So pretty good deal I guess. Our small version of the calm before the storm.

None of us had ever seen it before. Seeing it lasted 3 hours kind of put us off. But we started anyway after googling which one was first. 

Night was going normal and surprisingly it was pretty entertaining. We even ordered some food. Night was fun.

Until we heard a sound in the kitchen. And it wasn't subtle. It sounded like someone grabbed a pan and started playing with it. I ran towards the kitchen thinking there was nobody going to be there. We had no back door and windows were barred so there was no way anyone could've snuck in.

I was wrong. A man in a suit was standing there. Just looking at me with the pan in his hands. I froze. He gave me a calming smile and then proceeded to slam the pan against the glass table so hard it shattered it completely. 

My mom and sister gathered up the courage to enter the kitchen after such a loud noise. 

I liked horror movies. So I closed my eyes waiting for one of two things to happen. Either the table was destroyed and I was the only one there making my family think I had lost it or nothing was broken and it was just an illusion. 

Well… neither happened. The man was still standing there. The table was still broken and the man spoke. 

“You'll have to excuse us.” Said with a raspy but elegant voice. “We couldn't help but notice your house has enough space to house us all. Unfortunately… well.” He grinned looking at my mom.

“There's just one extra person in the house. Don't worry you'll enjoy hell.”

After saying that he stabbed my mom in the back in less than a second. And just like that disappeared. 

My sister screamed. I tried to stop the bleeding while calling an ambulance. But she was dead. And she was not coming back. 

After that, our new new guests made our life a living hell. Neighbors noticed parties everyday. When they had enough we told them we tried to stay away from the house my mom was murdered in. My sister got angry at the thought of our neighbor thinking we would party everyday in the house we lost everything. Especially after being in a long legal process where we both were blamed. For some miracle we were set free. My sister reminded this to the people with a good punch to the face. 

Like I said before, our lives became a living hell. First we were held and sent to prison for months and then we had to live in the same house those fuckers did. 

We met them all. And there's one particular one who loves the attention. And really want me to write about it. How do I know? The disgusting thing is squatting on the table(a made out of wood one) looking right at me expectedly as I write this on my laptop. But since they are ruining our lives, at least I'm gonna leave this piece of shit last. 

Unless he kills me for pressing post without having written about him.
