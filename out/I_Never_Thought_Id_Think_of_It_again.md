I…guess I don’t know where to start.

It really first happened when I was, maybe 11?
I had a nightmare the night before, I was in my room, I heard footsteps outside my house, sprinting, and I looked outside.
And there was this figure, all black.
I know, a story everyone’s heard more than once, more than a hundred times, but there it was. Four legs, maybe 6’1, two pure white eyes, and it stood in the street.
Facing me.
It knew who I was, I could tell, the stare was personal. 

The next night I was honestly afraid of going to bed, I told my dad about it, stating I thought I saw the devil (we were going to church fairly religiously at that time, that’s changed since then,) and all he responded with was “the devil doesn’t actually show himself, just go to bed. You’ll forget about it by the morning.”
And he was right, I finally fell asleep, and the next morning it slipped my mind.

I still don’t know what it was, even after tonight. 

That nightmare, it ended with a 2012 Nissan Juke, regular color, ramming into the creature.
Then I woke up.

Tonight, I just got done hanging with my girlfriend, I was going down the street I always went, North Anderson, going south so I can get to my house..
And there it was again. 
At the end of the street, I saw it.
Four legs, tall, two pure white eyes.
Staring right at me.
I felt this sudden urge to ram into it, slamming on my gas, not caring about the damage, the collateral of the other cars parked.

But, my foot met the brakes, the creatures eyes widened, and it ran off into one of my neighbors backyard…

I hadn’t thought about that thing until tonight, it’s been seven years.
I don’t know what was different about today, but it appeared again.

what’s really bothering me, is the fact I’m driving a Nissan juke.
2012.
Stock color.

Sorry if this seems…spastic and kind of all over the place, I’m still trying to wrap my head around it all and trying to stop shaking. 

I told my girlfriend about it, but she just told me I was tired and just needed sleep.
And she was right, I was extremely tired.
I was up until 3 the night prior, so it makes sense.
Maybe I was just seeing things, but it doesn’t explain the actual, physical prints in the snow leading into my neighbors backyard. 
The rest of the night I heard strange noises, it sounded almost like animal whimpering mixed with groans of pain. Animal like and human like.

I didn’t sleep much, the noises persisted until about 4:30 AM, they just abruptly stopped and disappeared.
When I went to look outside, there were some footprints, or more so shoe prints. They looked exactly like my shoe print, the bottom soles are identical. 
I don’t know what to make of it, whether or not it has correlation to what I saw, or a coincidental thing where a guy that for whatever reason was walking around with the same shoes as me. 


I don’t know what’s happening, it’s kinda been getting to me. I’m at work now while typing this up, but I just needed this as an outing to get this off my chest. 
If anyone has seen or dealt with something similar, please tell me. Maybe it’ll give me some ease. 

I gotta get back to work, but it’s been slow so if I get any chats or comments, I should be able to reply.
