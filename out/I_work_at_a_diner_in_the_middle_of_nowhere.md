I’m writing this while yesterday is still clear in my head, because that day was a pretty good example of what working at the diner is actually like. Not the worst day. Not the strangest. Just normal.

A little context might be helpful. The diner sits in the middle of nowhere. One road in, one road out. No streetlights. Cell service comes and goes depending on the weather. Most of the customers only show up because something else has already gone wrong. A missed exit. A breakdown. A GPS that stopped working.

The sign out front says EAT, and the A flickers constantly. We’ve already replaced the wiring twice. Yesterday, like always, it still flickered. Marlene said it liked attention. She says stuff like that a lot.

I clocked in around noon. Poured coffee. Wiped the counter. Followed the same rules I’d learned early on and didn’t think about anymore.

Don’t sit in Booth Six on Sundays.

Don’t clean under the back table.

Don’t argue with the phone.

I took the trash out in the afternoon and saw the rats behind the building. They were already there, scattered around the garden. They never moved together. No packs. No patterns. One ran straight through the dirt, another froze in the open like it had forgotten how legs worked, another climbed the fence and sat there watching the back door.

They went wherever they wanted, but they always stayed between the garden and the diner.

The gnomes were there too.

Marlene kept a small garden out back. Tomatoes that never quite ripened. Herbs that smelled wrong. Yesterday there were nine garden gnomes standing in it. Old ones. Chipped. Sun-faded. All different styles, like they’d been collected over time instead of bought as a set.

They were lined up neatly. Even spacing. Straight rows.

Every single one of them faced the back door.

I stood there for a minute, mostly counting them. They didn’t move. They never did if anyone was watching. I already knew that, so I went back inside to grab a cup of coffee. When I came back out, one of them was closer to the door. Another had turned slightly, like it was correcting its angle.

The rats didn’t react. They ran through the line of gnomes, bumped into them, climbed over them without any urgency. They never attacked them. They just didn’t move out of the way. By the time I went back inside, the rats had settled in front of the gnomes in their usual messy way.

When I checked again later, three of the gnomes had fallen. One was cracked clean in half. None of them were any closer to the door.

I mentioned to Marlene that the gnomes kept tipping over and asked if she wanted me to move them farther back.

She didn’t look up from the register. “Don’t interfere,” she said. “They’re not supposed to get in.”

The payphone rang during the dinner rush.

It was mounted between the bathrooms, still working, despite having to be at least thirty years old. I picked it up without thinking. The breathing was already there. Same as usual. A man, close to the receiver, slow and steady.

I waited. It had become habit at this point.

Luckily, Marlene came over and dropped coins into my hand. Two quarters, a dime, and three pennies.

“He wants sixty-three cents,” she said.

I fed the coins into the phone while the breathing continued. When the last penny dropped, the line went quiet.

“Thank you,” the man said, polite and relieved.

That was it. I hung up and went back to refilling coffee.

When my shift ended, there was a small package on the counter. Brown paper. Twine. No name. Inside was a replacement phone charger. The same kind I’d mentioned losing earlier that day.

The rest of the day stayed uneventful in the way it always is. The coffee pot refused to brew until I apologized to it. A customer tried to sit in Booth Six and left looking pale and crying. And a car pulled into the parking spot under the flickering A and vanished.

Marlene comped the meal and laid bus tickets on their table before the driver even noticed.

Nothing bad happened yesterday. That’s the part that always sounds like a lie when I say it out loud.

I’m writing this down because when you work somewhere like that, the strange parts blur together unless you keep track of them.
