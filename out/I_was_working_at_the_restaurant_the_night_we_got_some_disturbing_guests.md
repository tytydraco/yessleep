I always envied the patrons I had to serve at the upscale hotel restaurant where I worked. Wealthy, glamorous types with condescending wives accompanied by foreign nannies paid to fawn over their spoiled little offspring. And then there were the tips, which, contrary to my expectations, seemed to grow smaller even as the diners got wealthier. After two months of being berated by anorexic wives who blamed me for not adhering to their dietary needs (even though all I did was serve what someone else had cooked for them), having leftovers thrown at me by their unhappy-it’s-not-pizza kiddos, and being treated like a second class citizen by their frugal millionaire husbands, I decided I was better off switching jobs. And then came the night of the fundraising gala.

My manager told me they were short of staff and begged me to work there one more night, since the event was supposed to lead to something like double or triple our usual traffic. It was organized by some artsy non-profit I had never heard of, which my manager nicknamed The Picassos. Their dinner was set to start at six, though the guests began arriving thirty minutes earlier.

The first sign that these guests were very different from the usual crowd was in their attire. They were all wearing masks. And not the pandemic-kind, but rather carnival type of stuff: glitzy and covering their entire faces. But that wasn’t the only oddity. Besides wearing masks, these new guests also wore leather gloves, which they never took off even while eating. Speaking of the food, it was the first time we were given marching orders to serve everything on plastic plates with plastic forks, spoons, and cups rather than using our usual bone china dinnerware.

“If they wanted plastic, why didn’t they just go to McDonalds?” Roberto, one of my fellow waiters privately fumed, but we had no choice but to obey our instructions.

After dinner was finished, one of the guests got up and approached the podium, with his face hidden behind a devil mask. He grabbed the mic and talked briefly about the importance of supporting the careers of underprivileged artists, before launching into an auction of their artwork.

While the guests prepared their paddles, the restaurant manager gathered all the employees in the back room and announced that this part of the evening was to be private. No employee was allowed to remain in the restaurant before it finished. It was the most bizarre night of my whole time working there, as we were all herded outside and asked to wait for an indefinite amount of time until the auction finished.

“I hope we’re still getting paid for this,” Roberto said an hour later, as we continued standing next to one of the dumpsters patiently awaiting our manager to allow us back in. By this point, many of our fellow employees had already returned from their own impromptu bathroom breaks and finished devouring their hastily purchased snacks, growing increasingly bored with nothing to do. It was a moonless night and pitch dark, with a gusty wind blowing stray wrappers out of the dumpster and in our faces.

“That’s it, I’m going in there,” Wendy said after ten more minutes have passed. While the rest of us were in our twenties and thirties, she was in her fifties and behaved with a certain authority. After an hour of freezing our butts off, we had all agreed it was the strangest shift we had ever worked. Wendy was just the first one of us brave enough to articulate what everyone was thinking.

“I’ll go with you,” I said, as the first rumble of thunder boomed overhead.

“Why?” she asked suspiciously.

“If you go alone, they might fire you,” I said. “Besides, there’s safety in numbers and all that.”

“How benevolent of you, Alice,” she snorted.

“Not really. I was about to quit anyway.”

She looked at me surprised, but didn’t say another word. No one else offered to join us, preferring not to stick their own necks out in case the ax proved quick to fall. But since I had nothing to lose, I didn’t care.

We entered the hotel the same way we had exited it, quietly shuffling in through the back door. But by the time we reached the restaurant, Wendy had gotten cold feet.

“Why don’t you check it out and report back to us?” she whispered in my ear. “I have three mouths to feed at home and don’t need the drama.”

I nodded, as she gave me a thumbs up that didn’t quite match the evil eye she had been giving me for the past five minutes after I announced I was quitting. I waited a moment until she disappeared down the hall, before approaching one of the restaurant’s windows.

The auction still appeared to be in full swing, with paddles being raised and the auctioneer yelling out numbers. But what attracted my attention were the objects being auctioned: paintings of people’s faces. Rather ironic, considering that the bidders all had their own faces hidden.

The paintings proved to be surprisingly well drawn with faces that looked so realistic they might as well have been real people, right down to minor details like birth marks, moles, freckles, wrinkles, slightly crooked smiles and fractured noses. Impressed by the level of artistry, I decided to take a picture of them on my cell phone, snapping a photo just as a painting of an elderly woman was auctioned off, followed by a painting of a teenager. Both were auctioned off to the first bidder that raised their paddle, with no counter bids.

After the second painting I was just about to turn away, when something in the next painting presented caught my eye. I suppose it must have been the hazel eyes I had looked into every night during our two year relationship. Or maybe it was the dimple on his left cheek. But I couldn’t help but spot the uncanny resemblance to my ex-boyfriend Chase.

The auctioneer, still in his devil mask, called out a price that was higher than my month’s salary. A moment later a woman in a butterfly mask raised her paddle. As with the previous two paintings, there were no other bidders. I swallowed hard as Chase’s face was taken down from the stand after the woman’s bid was finalized. It had been a year since we broke up, and I still dreamed of him in my sleep.

A minute later, there was a scraping of chairs and muted commotion as the auctioneer thanked his guests for coming. The fundraising gala was over. I quickly turned around and ran back outside. Hungrily breathing in the evening air after holding my breath for most of the past ten minutes, I explained what I had seen to my fellow employees. Wendy was the first to react.

“Bunch of weirdos,” she said, and everyone nodded. No one else dared comment, afraid that one of us might go back to the manager and report on who said what.

Fifteen minutes later the manager appeared and motioned us back in. Once we were inside the restaurant, we were met with our next surprise of the night. There was nothing to clean up. Indeed, it was almost like nothing had even taken place. The tables were completely empty, with all the chairs pushed back in. The tablecloths were neat and there was no trash to be found anywhere in the room. In response to our questioning looks, our manager stayed tight mouthed.

“I was told they preferred to clean up after themselves, so really, there was no use for us to stay here,” was all he said.

We all looked at him like he was crazy, having never seen anything like it. He then turned his back to us and ran out in a hurry, leaving us alone inside the deserted restaurant, staring at the immaculate tables. After a moment, Roberto nervously burst into laughter. It hit like a domino, as the rest of us joined in. The whole evening had just been too bizarre. Thank God it was to be my last night there.

Originally, I was going to put it all out of my mind and move on with my life. I had already applied to my next job and had an interview that seemed to go well, even though I had yet to hear back. But as time went on, something kept bothering me about that evening at the restaurant.

In the middle of a sleepless night two weeks later, I finally realized what it was. It was just that the paintings had looked so real. Too real. What if they actually were of real people? Ordinarily, I wouldn’t have given it another thought, but because Chase was in the mix, I had to find out why. So I opened up the Google images search on my phone and uploaded the pictures I had taken of the paintings, one by one. To my surprise, there was a match returned for each one.

The painting of the elderly lady matched with the “In Memory Of” photo of one Melinda C. (I’m not including her full name for privacy reasons). My first thought was that the painting must have been commissioned by a bereaved relative. But when I scrolled further down the page, which featured bits of her obituary along with details about her memorial service, it soon became clear that she had actually died “unexpectedly” a week *after* the fundraising gala. There was no further information provided, but my interest was now piqued.

The painting of the teenager that had been the next one auctioned off ended up matching the Twitter profile photo of someone named Deborah A. Just like with Melinda, the comments revealed that Deborah had “suddenly” passed away two days before. Also after her portrait had been sold at the fundraising gala.

I gulped. And then I thought about Chase. I prayed he still had the same cell phone number as before, as I rushed to call him in the middle of the night. If he was anything like the old Chase, he would yell at me for interfering with his sleep, which he already got hardly any of because of his long hours at the law firm. But just in case this was anything but the tragic coincidence I hoped it was, I took a breath and dialed his number. He picked up on the second ring, with his voice still groggy.

“Alice? What the hell?”

In the spade of five minutes, I blurted out the whole story. By the time, I was finished, Chase’s voice sounded different.

“So?” he said. “Maybe they were all terminally sick or something and their family members wanted a portrait to remember them by before they died.”

“The obituaries all said they passed away suddenly.”

“And? They still could’ve been sick.”

“Are you sick?” I asked pointedly.

“No, of course not.”

I smiled at his response. Not just ‘no,’ but ‘no, of course not.’ Yup, just like the insufferable Chase of the old.

“So there you go,” I said instead.

“Okay, but how do you even know these were pictures of actual people rather than just similar looking drawings? Just because—“

“It was Google freaking images, okay? If even AI could spot the similarities… And it wasn’t just ‘drawings.’ We’re talking remarkably detailed portraits.”

And then, before Chase could protest, I hung up and texted him a picture of his own portrait. My phone stayed silent for all of two minutes. And then it lit up with Chase’s number.

“Whoa, these guys are good,” he said when I picked up. “Can I purchase my own copy?”

“Only if you stay alive long enough to do that.”

“Alice, you need help.”

“Stop it.”

“Seriously. Go see a shrink or something,” he said. “You were always a bit…crazy. That’s why we broke up, wasn’t it?”

“No, we broke up because you were turning into a jerk.”

“Alice—“

“Is there anyone who would want to harm you?” I interrupted. “Anyone at all?”

“Okay, now you’re saying these people—if these were actual people rather than random drawings that just happened to look like them—were intentionally harmed? Babe, you don’t just need a shrink. You need a psych ward.” And with that Chase hung up.

I struggled for the rest of the night, but sleep would not come. In the morning, I resolved to get it out of my mind once and for all. But just in case, I had to let someone else know. I could never live with myself if Chase met some untimely end and I just sat on the evidence.

So I called up Wendy, the only one brave enough to not always toe the line. She picked up sounding surprised, as I recited the whole story for a second time, doing my best to sound composed and hoping she wouldn’t do a Chase and write me off as crazy. But a moment after I finished speaking, her voice sounded somber.

“If what you’re saying is true, that explains why the guests wore masks and cleaned up after themselves. They wanted to stay anonymous and avoid leaving anything behind that could be tied back to them, such as their DNA.”

“That makes sense!” I said. “But Wendy, this is just between us, okay? I can’t really do anything about it because I don’t work there anymore, but can you find out more about that evening? Like, who paid for the gala or at least made the reservations?”

“I’ll try,” Wendy said after a long pause. “But I don’t want to get mixed up in something bad.”

“Of course.”

“So if it’s anything like you’re saying…I’m out.”

“Got it. Just let me know either way, okay? I’m just worried about my ex.”

“Will do.”

After we hung up, I felt a little calmer. Just in case, I decided, I would call the cops and hand over my photos of the portraits and the Google image search results. I just had to have something more to work with, before the restaurant clammed up as soon as the cops made their entrance. And for that, I needed to give Wendy some time. I just prayed that, in the meantime, Chase would be okay.

I spent the next week constantly checking his social media making sure that he was still alive. Gradually, as his torrent of tweets and Instagram posts continued uninterrupted, I began to feel a little better. And then one night I got a call from Wendy.

“They’re here again,” she said as soon as I picked up.

“Who?”

“Those weirdos from the fundraising gala. Just like last time. All in masks, gloves, and eating off plastic plates. We were again told to wait outside until they’re done.”

“Did you get the name of the organizer?” I asked breathlessly.

“The guy who made the reservations? Yup. Tim Brandon. Same as the name on the credit card used. But I think it’s a fictional name.”

“Why?”

“Just a gut feeling. Anyway, I wouldn’t worry about it if I was you.”

“Excuse me?”

And that’s when Wendy confessed she had sneaked in during the last part of the gala, to see it all for herself.

“You were right. Those paintings did look so…life-like. But the last painting that was auctioned off was what really gave me the creeps and convinced me we actually might be on to something here,” she said, before her voice abruptly changed. “It’s just that it looked so much like…you.”

Before I could control myself, I let out a little scream.

“I didn’t say anything to anyone about our conversation,” she quickly said. “I swear! But I’ll try to find out who did.”

I spent the night walking around my apartment after barricading the front door, while looking up more info about the recently deceased Melinda and Deborah. I tried to unsuccessfully convince myself that the coincidences between the faces on the paintings and their deaths in real life was just my overactive imagination creating connections where there were none, scaring Wendy into seeing things my way.

But the bits and pieces of info I discovered from the local stories and social media posts made me even more nervous. It turned out that Melinda had been a wealthy heiress who had left her fortune to her much younger husband. The same man organizing her memorial services. She had died after her mansion was burglarized and she was strangled. The second victim, Deborah, was a fifteen-year-old who had been stuck in a custody battle between her bitter parents. Shortly after her mother won in court, she was abducted while walking back from school and then found drowned. I officially gave up on sleeping, when Wendy called me back an hour later.

“Your ex was the one who tattled on you,” she said as soon as I picked up. ”He came to the restaurant, spoke to Roberto and asked for the manager. This was the day before yesterday. I must have been on break or something, because I completely missed it. Roberto said he stuck around to eavesdrop when Chase talked with the manager, and apparently Chase complained about what you told him—basically the same thing you told me—and called you crazy. I guess he thought you were still working here and was trying to get you fired.”

“And two days later, suddenly *my* portrait is part of that auction?” I said, feeling chills travel up and down my spine. “What is this? Yet another coincidence?”

“I’m quitting too,” Wendy said after a long pause. “This is just too creepy. Even for me. Stay safe and don’t call me again. Who knows who these people are, but I don’t need to see *my* own face out there.” And then she hung up on me.

I hid the phone in my pocket. An hour later, still unable to sleep, I gave up and got up to make myself some coffee. And then I heard it. Footsteps outside my door. There was a long pause, and then—right in front of my eyes—my doorknob started to turn. I screamed as loud as I could. The doorknob paused. A second later, there were more footsteps down the hall.

“Alice are you okay?” It was the voice of Amanda, my neighbor who lived two doors down.

More footsteps. This time it sounded like someone was running down the stairs. I walked up to my door and stared through the peephole. Amanda was there alone, in her PJs and bunny slippers, looking concerned. I opened the door and quickly ushered her in before slamming the door shut.

“Who was that guy outside your door?” she asked as soon as we were inside my apartment.

“Tell me what he looked like,” I said.

“I only saw the back of his head. Dark hair, black jeans. Ran off as soon as I called your name.”

I started shaking.

“He just had this aura about him…like he was up to no good, you know?” she said. “And then you screamed.”

“Amanda, you did the right thing,” I said. But before I could continue, there was a noise outside my door. We froze as my doorknob starting turning again. Apparently my lock was no match for whoever was outside. Before the doorknob could move any more, Amanda and I both grabbed it with all our might to keep it in place, making it two against one.

My heart hammered in my ears as I removed my cell phone from my pocket with my other hand and dialed 911, purposely speaking as loudly as possible. This finally had the intended effect as the effort to open my door suddenly stopped. Moments later we heard the footsteps running down the stairs again, but this time we didn’t budge, keeping our hands firmly on the doorknob before the cops arrived.

As soon as they did, I told them what happened and Amanda backed my words up, before I launched into the ‘why’ and told them about my old job and the masked creeps who attended the fundraising gala during my last day there, selling and buying portraits of people shortly before they were killed. As evidence, I submitted the photos on my cell phone and the Google image matches, along with the information I got about the deaths online.

The cops wanted me to go to the station with them, but I had something else on my mind. Something that had been on my mind incessantly, ever since my worst fears were confirmed. Chase. I asked them to wait until I dialed his number. They obliged, but this time Chase didn’t pick up. I quickly checked his social media, but the last update was from this morning. It was now the end of the day, and there had been nothing since then. It was most unlike him. So I told the cops I wanted to check up on him. One of them raised an eyebrow but considering everything that had happened, they agreed to go with me to his apartment.

It was a twenty minute drive from my own apartment. His door opened on the very first knock, but instead of Chase, it was a young blonde in a t-shirt and string bikini who appeared, looking at us suspiciously. His new girlfriend.

“Where’s Chase?” I asked, ignoring the hurt I felt. It wasn’t like Chase owed anything to me. After all, it had been more than a year since we broke up.

“I was going to ask you that,” the blonde said. “Last I heard he was still at work.” And then she saw the cops. “Why, did something happen to him?”

Inside the police car, I looked up his law firm on my cell phone and dialed the number that was posted for him. It rang and rang with no answer. We drove up to his building. But it was locked and dark.

“Maybe he went to the bar or something,” one of the cops said, shrugging. “Listen, your story sounded very…convincing, but at this point it’s mere speculation. We live in a big city. There’s lots of crime out here, and well, things happen. People get burglarized. Maybe even abducted, if they’re really unlucky. I’ve seen more than enough of it during my time on the job. Sometimes it really is nothing but wrong place, wrong time.”

“But the paintings—” I began, before he interrupted.

“—Are really nothing but circumstantial evidence,” he said. “Yes, I’ll admit they *do* look a bit like those people you showed me, but it’s something that would easily get thrown out in court.”

“If it was all innocent, then why did the attendees all wear masks? Why were we ordered to wait outside while they did their auction? Why did—“

“More circumstantial evidence,” the cop interrupted.

“I think it’s because they didn’t want us to see their faces or what they were doing,” I said.

The cop shrugged, but gave me his business card.

“In case you learn anything more,” he said.

It was apparent he and his buddies were not going to get involved. At least not at this stage. I refused to go back to my apartment so he gave me a lift to a nearby hotel, where I maxed out my credit card.

The next morning I called Chase’s law firm and finally got someone on the phone. The receptionist sounded like she was crying.

“They found him this morning, with his work ID still in his wallet,” she said with a shaking voice. “Apparently he was mugged last night and then stabbed to death.”

I was barely able to keep myself from screaming, desperately keeping the tears at bay before I could hang up.

“He was mugged, but his killer didn’t even take his wallet?” I asked, unable to keep my voice from cracking.

That took a moment to process, before the receptionist let out an audible yelp.

“Tell me, did he have any enemies?” I asked her, while packing up. I had given the hotel my real name, which meant I could not stay here any longer than I had to.

“Who are you again?” The receptionist tensed up.

“His ex-girlfriend. Alice.”

A moment later, her voice relaxed.

“Oh yeah, I remember you. You were with him last year, at our annual retreat?”

“That’s right.”

“Not exactly ‘enemies,’ but he did have a…disagreement with one of our clients. A very expensive disagreement, if you catch my drift.”

“Expensive?”

“Six to seven figures worth of lost revenue according to the client.”

I gulped, and hung up. My best friend had moved to Mexico six months ago and now was my time to join her. But not before I called the number on the business card the cop had given me and left a message on his answering machine about Chase’s death, linking it to his portrait from that ‘fundraising gala’.

\*\*\*

It was months before I finally learned the truth, once the cops finally stopped stonewalling me and an investigation was started. The non-profit behind the fundraising galas whose goal was to ostensibly ‘support impoverished artists’ was actually a front for a secret organization that operated contract killings. The payments for the murders masqueraded as payments for the paintings, which is why there was an obsession with privacy and anonymity of the guests during the fake fundraising galas. It was so that no one could be identified if the truth was ever revealed. After the transactions were completed, the victims were liquidated in ways that made it look like random killings.

Last I heard, the cops were still investigating, keeping it all hush-hush for fear of scaring off the perpetrators while secretly infiltrating various fundraising galas, suspecting the paintings have since been ditched for something not yet on their radar. Meanwhile, the restaurant where I used to work has shuttered its doors, while publicly blaming its closure on recession. As for me, I’ve been moving around a lot, after the bungalow I shared with my friend in Mexico no longer felt safe. Recently the staffing agency I signed up with said they received a job offer for me. At an artsy non-profit.
