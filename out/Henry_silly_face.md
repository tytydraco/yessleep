when I was 10 I had a fear of clowns now this is not unusual behavior, but my reason was far more personal

So I was at a my friend Charlie birthday party and at his party his parents rented a clown named Henry silly face 

Henry, silly face, wears a normal clown costume but the only distinguishable thing is that he wears a mask

And at the party I was eating some mediocre, Pizza when Henry silly face walked up to me and said I should invite him to my parties. I told him that I don’t really like clowns

Henry silly face, said why don’t you like clowns I told him I think they’re kind of stupid. Henry looked at me and furiously whispered you’re a bad kid don’t you know that

He then walked away. I was kind of weirded out by this, but I didn’t want to ruin the party so I kept it to myself and when it was time for us to open presents 

Charlie’s mom has anyone seen Charlie because apparently he disappeared I thought to myself that Henry was talking a lot to Charlie so I thought that maybe Henry took him

And just as we were leaving, I saw Henry silly face waving at me and as we were driving home, I told my mom about what Henry’s silly face said to me

My mother told me that he’s just a jerk, and we don’t need to hire him this gave me a sigh, relief, but that quickly changed over the following months 

As I kept getting letters from Henry, silly face trying to have a conversation with me through the mail. 

He said things like he would’ve loved me as a son. And that he will always be there with me and to let him throw me a special party

And my dad who had enough of this call the clown service that Henry was allegedly a part of to complain about how Henry was harassing me

But to my dad‘s was shocked clown catering service said that they already have fired him and they didn’t send him to my friend Charlie’s party

Upon hearing this, my parents start packing up our belongings and tried to leave as soon as possible 

and on moving day as we were packing our belongings in the car, I felt like I saw Henry silhouette but this time, not wearing a mask, revealing a grotesque face as he was in the window watching us

But that was all 20 years ago I am currently married, and have a son and just as I thought, my life was going good 

my son came home today and told me and my wife about a clown, wearing a mask who asked him if his birthday was coming up

My son told the clown. Yeah I’m gonna be. 7 years old soon when the clown said you should invite me to your party

 my son, who did not know much at the time about Henry, silly face, my son agreed and told him where we live 

My son‘s birthday is in a few days I feel like Henry’s gonna show up on his birthday and only God knows what he will to us
