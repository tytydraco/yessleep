when I was 10 I had a fear of clowns now this is not unusual behavior, but my reason was far more personal

So I was at a my friend Charlie birthday party and at his party his parents rented a clown named Henry silly face 

Henry, silly face, wears a normal clown costume but the only distinguishable thing is that he wears a mask

And at the party I was eating some mediocre, Pizza when Henry silly face walked up to me and said I should invite him to my parties. I told him that I don’t really like clowns

Henry silly face, said why don’t you like clowns I told him I think they’re kind of stupid. Henry looked at me and furiously whispered you’re a bad kid don’t you know that

He then walked away. I was kind of weirded out by this, but I didn’t want to ruin the party so I kept it to myself and when it was time for us to open presents 

Charlie’s mom has anyone seen Charlie because apparently he disappeared I thought to myself that Henry was talking a lot to Charlie so I thought that maybe Henry took him

And just as we were leaving, I saw Henry silly face waving at me and as we were driving home, I told my mom about what Henry’s silly face said to me

My mother told me that he’s just a jerk, and we don’t need to hire him this gave me a sigh, relief, but that quickly changed over the following months 

As I kept getting letters from Henry, silly face trying to have a conversation with me through the mail. 

He said things like he would’ve loved me as a son. And that he will always be there with me and to let him throw me a special party

And my dad who had enough of this call the clown service that Henry was allegedly a part of to complain about how Henry was harassing me

But to my dad‘s was shocked clown catering service said that they already have fired him and they didn’t send him to my friend Charlie’s party

Upon hearing this, my parents start packing up our belongings and tried to leave as soon as possible 

and on moving day as we were packing our belongings in the car, I felt like I saw Henry silhouette but this time, not wearing a mask, revealing a grotesque face as he was in the window watching us

But that was all 20 years ago I am currently married, and have a son and just as I thought, my life was going good 

my son came home today and told me and my wife about a clown, wearing a mask who asked him if his birthday was coming up

My son told the clown. Yeah I’m gonna be. 7 years old soon when the clown said you should invite me to your party

 my son, who did not know much at the time about Henry, silly face, my son agreed and told him where we live 

My son‘s birthday is in a few days I feel like Henry’s gonna show up on his birthday and only God knows what he will to us

**(update)**

Ok so where we last left off Henry silly face was stalking my son 

Well I was confused as to why Henry was stalking my son the my wife said maybe because he only takes people on their birthdays 

So after that bombshell me and my wife decided to try to find find somewhere else to stay in for his birthday so we drove to a hotel on the outskirts of where we live 

Although my son was kind disappointed that he weren’t throwing a party

But when we got to the hotel we tried to make up for the party by allowing him to have some candy and he seemed better after that 

And after his birthday as we were packing up the car I noticed that my son wasn’t there  

I went to our room with was on the first floor and saw a trail of candy leading into the forest by the hotel 

And well I called my wife to park near the forest she asked why I told her Henry silly face took our son

And then I grabbed a gun I knife and went into the woods 

now yes this isn’t a good weapon but it is the only one that I had at the time 

And as I was following the trail I saw more candy wrappers and then I got to where the candy wrappers were leading. 

It was the clown rental van, the one that was at Simon‘s party.

I opened the vans door and I saw the body of Simon now rotten and mutilated, 

but it wasn’t just Simon body in there. There was other children 

but it wasn’t just children in the van I saw graphic pornography, a bunch of hardware tools, 

But luckily, I did not see my son‘s body so part of me thinks he might still be alive

But as I was leaving the van, I saw Henry just staring at me with his mask off

He looked terrible far worse than when I saw him without it in my window

 He had bloodshot eyes and broken teeth and his hideous face of wrinkles and scars

 and Henry was also holding a gun 

I yelled at him where’s my son?

Henry told me that I will never find him 

Before he then shot my hand with was holding the knife causing me to drop the knife 

Henry then approached me laughing as he picked up my knife trying to slit my throat 

But something kicked in me and I punched him in the face, knocking him in the face causing him to fall over in pain. 

I grabbed my knife and picked up his gun and started running through the woods 

but unfortunately he had removed the wrappers meaning I was running in circles, trying to avoid this clown

But unfortunately, I ran towards a lake, and Henry had arrived Henry now visibly more furious charged at me, 

but luckily the gun had one bullet left in it, so I shot Henry in the neck causing him to fall over 

And as a walked up to him he was still alive but laughing telling me that I’m still a bad kid but also a bad dad

I yelled at him where’s my son 

He told me that I will never see him again

I then then was about to stomp his head when he tells me that my son is alive 

I then yelled where Henry just said it’s been fun kiddo see in hell before then rolling into the water drowning himself 

And I just let out the most animalistic scream full of wrath and sorrow as I will never see my precious son again 

I went back to the car my wife asked why my hand was bleeding I told her that Henry shot me she didn’t ask me if Henry’s dead I told her yes she didn’t ask where is our son? I lied to her and told him he died.

We drove home and my wife bless her heart, cried herself to sleep

And if you’re my son and you are reading this, I miss you buddy I really do. I’m sorry, Joseph.
