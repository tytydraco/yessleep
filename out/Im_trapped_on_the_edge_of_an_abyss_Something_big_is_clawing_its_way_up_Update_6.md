I had that dream again. The one in the desert at the bottom of the abyss.

It was different this time, though. I was still standing among the glistening, black sand dunes, and the wind was still whipping in a violent storm, but I wasn’t alone. There was something in front of me; a beast that I’d never seen before.

It was almost human looking in its face, but nowhere else. Its proportions were much larger than me, and pale skin—almost bone white—contrasted the black sand that it lay limp in. Its multiple arms tangled against each other as they ran along its serpent-like torso into the dark, and strange appendages like tree branches sprouted off its body like wings. It’s vacant, cataract eyes fixed on me as its form lurched and twitched occasionally.

Behind it, still shrouded in the dark, I could hear whispers and snapping bones.

*CRUNCH!*

The beast laying in the sand lurched again with a small grunt of pain as whatever was in the dark took a bite of it. I thought for a moment that the thing in front of me surely must be dead, and its eyes staring at me was just the vacant gaze of a corpse, but then a twisted, almost pitying smile played across its lips.

Suddenly it spoke in a wispy, gasping tone, “It hasn’t smelled you yet.”

*CLOMP, CHOMP!*

Its body spasmed again before its many arms began inching through the sand toward me, almost in desperation. Surely it knew that a small insect like me could do nothing if a monster like *it* couldn’t stop the predator feasting on it.

“It will eventually, though. There’s nothing you can do…” the strange thing continued, its gaunt jaw falling limp after it finished its sentence. “It’ll draw nearer, and then it’ll be too late.”

My breath hitched as I saw something move in the darkness behind it. The details were unclear with it still being so laden in shadow, but I could tell it was a hand. It grabbed one of the creatures branch-wings and effortlessly snapped it off like a toothpick, drawing it back into the dark where more loud clapping of its jaws cut through the wind.

The snake person let out a scream that made me cover my ears as black ichor began leaking from its wound. This somehow seemed to bring it some sort of joy as, after a moment, it smiled again and began to wheeze in a soft rhythm. It was laughing.

“Better wake up, little dreamer. Better get out before it catches your *divine* scent.”

In a flash, I saw two more hands creep out of the darkness and grab hold of the beast’s arms, yanking the whole snake back into the void. The suddenness of it made my heart leap, and it was enough to jolt me awake.

Hope snapped her head to me as I did. Clearly, I had woken with such a kick and a start that it was noticeable.

“You okay?” she asked.

I panted softly and brought myself back down to reality. Unfortunately, the reality I was bringing myself back to wasn’t much better than the dream. A dank, moldy office with a clone of me, a dying woman, and a homunculus of myself slowly sprouting under a blanket a few feet away.

Oh, yeah, and we were still trapped in this damn abyss.

Still, I focused back on her question, my heart still pounding and the dream still fresh in my brain. *Were* we okay? That had to have just been a simple dream, right? Stress related to our situation here, and enhanced by the creature that I’d only gotten hints and clues of? Plus there was the one getting eaten; it seemed like something that my brain would whip up to fill the gaps about everything we’ve heard outside in our time here. Plus, the beasts here didn’t talk except to mimic. It had to be my brain just freaking out.

Then again, we still were seeing new things everyday. If that really was some weird vision, and a sentient being that *lives* here was just warning me to get out, then… Well, we *really* needed to get out.

“Yeah. Fine.” I nodded to Hope with a smile.

I could tell she didn’t believe me, but she nodded nevertheless. Turning to her side, she picked up a water bottle and unscrewed the cap, leaning forward and cradling the head of the scientist we’d found in Zane's. Placing it to her lips, she tilted the jug up, letting a small trickle run down her throat.

“How is she?” I asked.

Hope shrugged, “Not much different. Still breathing, but still unresponsive.”

I nodded, then turned to the blanket. It was much, much larger now. I must have been out for a while.

“And our new arrival?” I pointed.

Hope shrugged again, “I haven’t checked in a bit after the last time when she didn’t have skin. But she looks, um… *almost* *done*, based on size.”

I nodded, then figured I’d do my part after making Hope play nurse while I slept. Reaching over, I clicked my light on and lifted the side of the blanket. We’d gotten the thing to drape over her because, A. we quickly learned the process of growing a ‘me’ was quite a disturbing one to watch, and B. We felt she probably wouldn’t want to wake up completely exposed whenever she did.

We also left to go grab her a set of clothes to wear preemptively, despite not wanting to leave the two unconscious bodies alone. Luckily, it was a pretty fast trip; we already knew her size.

Hensley #3 was definitely almost fully formed now, her hair fully grown out and falling in a tangled mess on the carpet. She clearly needed more time, however, as her skin still had a pinkish, fleshy sheen to it.

“Won’t be long now, I think,” I told Hope.

She nodded, as she finished tending to our new girl, then lay back down and fell back against her desk.

“You can rest now,” I told her, “Sorry I slept so long.”

“That’s okay. You needed it,” she smiled.

“You need it too,” I told her.

“I got some before you went down, remember?” she said.

I didn’t believe that she’d gotten nearly enough considering how frazzled she looked, but I didn’t have time to call her out on it before she spoke again.

“Do you want to talk about what happened back at Zane’s?”

I cocked my head, “What, like with the place turning into a total labyrinth and with lady over there being used as some sort of battery to run it? Yeah, I have some theories—”

“No, Hen, I mean as we were leaving.”

I dropped my smug attitude and hugged my knees, “Oh…”

Hope tossed her hands, “Why did you do that?”

“What do you mean why? We weren’t going to make it otherwise; you know that.”

“Okay, but why not let me do it? I’m your clone, Hen; we both know that. If anyone is expendable, it’s me.”

“Hope, I told you back at the vending machines that that’s not how we’re going to look this. You’re a person too; end of discussion.”

“You’re dodging my question.”

“What question?” I laughed defensively.

“Why did you jump at that so fast?”

I stared at her with my mouth open, ready to spout another excuse, but it was clear from her focused eyes that she wasn’t going to let me weasel out. My defensive laugh turned nervous, and I shied my eyes away.

“I… I don’t know, Hope. We’re going to die eventually anyway, right? Why does it matter? You’re my clone, you have just as much cancer as I do.”

“Bull crap, that’s not why.” She leaned forward then spoke softly, “C’mon, Hen, just talk to me.”

I sighed deep and kept my eyes away, “I don’t know, Hope. I just… things were chaotic, and I knew we weren’t going to make it, and I figured… If any of us deserve to leave this place, it’s you.”

Hope sat in silence for a long moment, then answered in utter confusion, “What?”

“What do you mean ‘what’?”

“What is that logic?” She chuckled.

It made me a little huffy that she was laughing as I opened up, “Is it just in your little ‘angel persona’ that you play humble and dumb? Come on, Hope, I know you see the differences between us. You’re kind, you’re smart, you’re caring and empathetic. You’re everything that we’ve wished we were our whole life.”

“And you’re not?”

I practically snorted, “Seriously? Hope, before we met Trevor, I was getting slopping drunk at the club every night. The only friends I had in my life were people who wouldn’t try to guilt me out of bad decisions—I isolated everyone away so I could be a self-destructive wreck because I didn’t care.”

“You were going through a lot.”

“No, I was going through a lot after mom died,” I told her, “After a while, though, you can’t beat that dead horse anymore, and that ‘lot’ becomes a whole lot of little when it comes to excuses.”

Hope couldn’t respond to that one, or maybe she just didn’t bother because she knew I wouldn’t listen.

I snickered softly, “You though? You somehow look back on that shitty life like it was the most beautiful thing ever. You know exactly what we’re going to do once we get out of here to turn it around, and all I can do is dread having to confront it.”

“Hen…”

I scoffed and buried my face into my hands, “I’m sorry—I’m being a bitch. You know it’s true, though. You’re my better half, Hope. You deserve to make it out of here alive, and I deserve whatever this place is.”

She was speechless towards my little tantrum for a long time, her hands folded in her lap while she thought. I think it was more for my sake than for hers, because when she finally spoke, she already knew what she was going to say.

“Hensley, I am you. Like it or not, you puked me up—same as her,” she pointed to the lump under the blanket.

I saw her argument coming and tried to immediately shut it down, “So? What if you being different is just a side effect of this place? What if your personality has nothing to do with me, and you only got my thoughts and memories?”

“I didn’t. I think the way that I do because it’s who you are, even if you don’t see it all the time and even if it’s buried deep down. In order for me to exist, I had to come from somewhere in *you*. That means that all that good you see in me? All those things you just said about me being your better half? They’re just as much you as they are me, Hensley.”

“Then why haven’t I felt like you in years?” I said plainly, staring right through her.

I almost saw the question catch her. She hesitated for the slightest of moments. It wasn’t because she thought I had a point, though. It was just that she didn’t know how to answer.

“I… I don’t know. Maybe you just forgot me somewhere inside all that pain.”

I looked at the floor again.

“But obviously there’s a reason I’m here now. Like you needed this part of you to get through this or something.”

I smiled at her, “You might be looking too much into it. I think maybe this place was just trying to tear me apart piece by piece.”

Hope chuckled off my joke, “You can’t be me all the time. We need each other. You’re logical and determined. You keep things grounded and see them as they really are. I’m not like that, Hen. I couldn’t last out there on my own—I’d dream too much, and break when things got too hard. You’re the strength, though. You’re the one who’s kept us alive through the years, whether you know it or not.”

She reached out and squeezed my hand, “And that’s why I *need* you to not die. We need to get you home, and we need to do this together, okay?”

I finally met her gaze, to which she smiled warmly.

“End of discussion,” she jokingly mocked.

I scoffed, then playfully swatted her hand away.

Our tender moment was interrupted when suddenly, a sound filled the space.

“No…”

Both of our heads whipped to the scientist. She was still laying motionless on the ground, but her eyes were open now and staring up at the ceiling. Hope and I quickly scrambled over to her.

“H-Hey there,” Hope awkwardly said in her most nurturing voice, “It’s okay, you’re safe now.”

“Dr. Shae?” The woman asked, the same as she had when she’d woken up the first time. Her voice sounded slurred and crackly, like she was drunk or very feverish. The amount of sweat on her brow and her red face all but confirmed the latter.

“No, we’re not Dr. Shae,” Hope told her, “My name is Hope, and this is Hens—”

“Y-You did this to me…”

Hope’s face went worried, “N-No, we helped you. You were stuck in some sort of machine when we—”

“I can’t see! Why can’t I see?” She groaned desperately.

“J-Just calm down; everything is going to be okay—”

“Hope.” I cut in softly, “I think she’s delusional.”

Hope looked desperately at me, and I nodded toward her pillow. Behind where she’d been laying, a puddle of blood had been forming from where the needle in the back of her head was. We’d bandaged it up and did our best to stop it, but we weren’t brain surgeons, and the damage had been done deep. that’s not even considering what had been done to the lobe behind her punctured eyes.

I saw Hope swallow hard as she tried to think of what to do, but there really wasn’t anything that we *could*.

“I-Is this hell?” The woman whimpered, “Are we in hell for what we did?”

Slowly, my clone reached her hand out and began softly stroking the woman’s forehead. Her body shifted in surprise, but quickly settled back at the tender touch.

“It’s okay…” Hope told her, “You’re not in hell.”

“The o-others,” the woman slurred, “Did they make it out safe?”

Hope and I looked at one another.

“Yeah,” I told her softly, “They did.”

The woman lay silent for a moment while she stared up at the rotting ceiling as if it were a beautiful, starry sky.

“It was incredible…” she eventually muttered.

“What was?” I asked calmly, as not to break her spell.

“This place… at the beginning… We found something new… w-we were going to be humanities next step… I remember Jacobs always said that,” the woman said with a slight whimsy to her tone.

“Why did they say that?” Hope said with a positive kick, trying to coax more.

“You used to say it too,” croaked the woman, “You told me that all of the answers… they were here.”

“Answers like what?” I questioned.

The woman didn’t respond to my question directly. Instead, she gave us a new tidbit with a sentence that made a chill run through my spine.

“We didn’t find any gods here… did you even know how deep it went, Shae? How deep it goes?”

Hope and I looked at each other again, but didn’t speak. Neither of us knew how to respond.

“Y-You told us it was safe, Shae,” the woman said, blood gurgling in the back of her throat, “You said that the stations… would keep us safe…”

“I… I know.” Hope feigned trying to calm her quickly raising voice, “It’s okay though. You’re safe now.”

“Safe?” The woman’s breathing began to pick up, “No… No… Not safe… Never safe…”

“Hey, just breathe, okay?” Hope said, the panic spreading to her.

“I’ve seen the bottom. I was tangled in the roots that stretch all the way to that black ocean deep below. We’re not safe. Nothing is.”

She was speaking clearer now, aside from the fluids blocking her airways. No more stuttering or fatigue. Just raw fear. Hope and I were very much afraid now too, the woman’s raspy, broken screams making our hearts pump fast.

“You did this, Shae. To me. To all of us. You and the rest of them think you know what you’re doing, but you don’t even know half the horrors down there. *I’ve* seen them and I can’t even begin to understand.”

The woman tried to sit up, causing blood to pour down her chin and more to leak from her eyes. Hope and I each grabbed a shoulder and tried to lay her back down, but she fought and kicked in her frantic panic. Her hand found purchase on my wrist finally and squeezed it like a vice, but then she stopped kicking. My breath hitched as her limp head rolled to me, and her bloody eyes fixed on my own. The thing that scared me was that I could tell she was truly blind; there’s no way she could see with the condition her eyes were in. Still, she was looking at me. Straight into me. Not physically, but something else.

“Y-You’re not Shae.” She gasped, “You’re just a tribute.”

“W-What?” I couldn’t help but sputter out.

She didn’t speak again, just stared, her breath heavy and hand trembling, “Oh God… You’ve seen it… It’s coming back… It’s coming back up…”

“W-What is? Hen what is she talking about?” Hope frantically sputtered.

I didn’t have time to answer before the woman fully melted down, “N-No… No. don’t let it take me…” she gripped me harder, her nails clawing into my wrists so hard they bled, “Don’t let it take me too! Please God, don’t let it take me!”

I let out a cry of pain, to which Hope took notice. She reached for the woman’s arms and grabbed them, yanking hard and trying to pull me free. It only made her claws tear more into my skin as she continued to cry in panic.

“It’s going to take us all! Don’t let it take me! Oh God, please! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry—I didn’t know!”

“*Gah!* Hope, get her off!” I screamed.

“I’m trying!” she whimpered.

“There is no end to it!” The woman wailed, her vocal chords in ribbons, “It’s writhing guts have no end!”

We wrestled with the woman for a few moments, screaming the whole time in curses and pleas. Neither Hope nor I could break her resolve at all until finally, she cracked it herself. With a choked, guttural gurgle from her throat, blood bubbled past her lips, and she fell back down on her bed, her nails releasing from my wrist. I quickly retracted my hand and hugged it to my stomach, but to be honest I was so transfixed by the woman that I didn’t even notice the pain.

Hope and I saw that as she lay there, her lips still seemed to be moving. Despite what had just happened, I couldn’t help but lean in, trying to make out what she was attempting to say.

“*—ep oup…”*

Hope leaned in to, and the woman muttered it again, this time clear enough for us to hear. There was really no need for us to; it was advice we already knew.

“Get… out…”

With that the woman lay still, a single breath gurgling past her flooded throat and then nothing at all. Hope and I fell back onto our knees and looked down at the woman, defeated. So much for getting any real answers to this place. At least we had a few more clues to work off of, though.

The theorizing would have to wait, however. As the two of us sat in silence, looking down at the poor woman, recollecting ourselves and sorting out what she’d just said, we heard the floor pop across the room.

The two of us snapped our heads in that direction, and my heart skipped a beat.

The blanket that we’d left Hensley 3 under was no longer on the floor with a lump beneath it. It was wrapped around a girl that looked just like me who had been slowly backing to the door. In all the chaos of what had just happened, Hope and I didn’t know how long she’d been awake for, but by the sheer look of fear on her face, it had clearly been long enough to catch the last few grueling minutes.

Obviously, I knew nothing about this new clone, but I did know one thing about myself. If I had blacked out upon entering a town, then woke up naked to find two figures wrestling over a dying, hysterical woman in a pitch black room… well let’s just day I didn’t blame her for running.

“Wait!” I called as she fumbled for the doorknob and tossed it open. She dashed into the hall and I moved after her as Hope scurried to her feet as well.

“We aren’t going to hurt you!” I screamed again, making it to the hallway and just barely catching her running toward the stairs. I saw her disappear out of view, then heard a harsh tumble as she tripped in the dark and plummeted down the rest of the way.

“Shit!” I yelled, continuing to chase after her.

Luckily, she seemed fine as she let out a pained grunt and jumped back to her feet. Unluckily, it didn’t seem to slow her one bit. Like a trapped animal, she sprinted for the door and slammed into it before I even cleared the bottom of the steps.

“Wait! You can’t go out there! It’s not safe!” Hope called from behind.

“Come back! We can explain!” I added.

“Help!” Hen three finally spoke, screaming to an empty town, “Somebody please help me!”

I once again continued my pursuit, but hesitated once I reached the doors and looked outside. Cast against the neighboring building was a deep, red glow.

“No, no, no—you have got to be kidding me!” I cursed under my breath. I practically kicked the door open, then started running down the street after her, “Hensley, wait! We’re your friends, I promise!”

The use of her name actually made her pause, and she slowed to give a small look over her shoulder before taking off again.

“Hen! There’s something out here!” Hope warned.

“I know, we have to stop her before she gets herself killed,” I called back, “Stay here! I’m going after her!”

“What? No, I’m—”

“There’s not time, Hope! No point in us both dying!”

“But—”

I suddenly got a sense of déjà vu, and our conversation from earlier flashed through my head, “This won’t be like Zane’s.” I told her softly, “I plan on coming back this time.”

She didn’t look happy about it, but thankfully put on her most confident face and nodded.

I started off as fast as I could in pursuit of ‘me’ number 3, slapping my feet hard against pavement and following her screams. I caught up fast on adrenaline alone, thankful that she didn’t have shoes yet to help her along. When I did, I called out again.

“Hensley, you need to be quiet! Something might hear you! I-I know you’re scared, but—”

“Leave me alone!” the new me hissed, spinning on her heels and adjusting her blanket, “What is going on? W-Where am I?”

My head spun around the streets, praying that the light had just kicked on and that whatever it was signaling hadn’t made it on the shelf yet. When I saw we had a few moments to spare, I put my hands up and spoke calmly.

“Do you remember the town you entered before everything went black? You’re still in that town, but it’s not safe here. It’s… It’s different from—”

“How do you know I blacked out?” the clone snapped, “How do you know exactly when my memory is foggy? What did you do to me?”

“I didn’t do anything!” I said a little too frantic, my voice growing unstable at the worry of her volume, “I swear I can explain—but you need to be quiet right now!”

I made the mistake of stepping closer, to which she backed away and yelled again, “Get back! S-Stay away!”

“Hensley, please,” I told her.

“How do you know my name!?”

Looking back, I wish I had let Hope come after all, because she would have been leagues better about easing this girl's worries. Me, on the other hand—I was probably the worst candidate.

I was getting a little frustrated, and the stress of the situation didn’t help. Yes, I’d had to do this all before already, but in similar circumstances, Hope had been much more calm and understanding about what was going on. I know this ‘me’ had witnessed us basically attacking a dying woman, but based on context clues, I feel like it wasn’t hard to see that she was more a threat to us than we were to her.

“Would you shut up!” I whisper yelled through gritted teeth, “I am trying to help you—you’re going to get us both—”

“Help!” Hen 3 screamed, starting to jog away again when she saw me start to move toward her.

That finally made my rage boil over, and my impulsive brain threw caution to the wind, “For fuck's sake—Your name is Hensley! You need to get home to Trevor, our boyfriend and Matthew, our dad. We had a cat named Rusty and went to Millbrook elementary and our favorite color is green. When we were kids, we had a blue bike that some neighbor kids stole and destroyed by doing stunts with it down the apartment stairs!”

Hensley stopped running and turned around, giving me a confused expression. Finally, for the first time, she spoke at a normal volume, “How… How do you…”

I didn’t have time to beat around the bush. Whatever was up here had undoubtedly heard us by now, and we needed to get back to the tower. I knew there was no fast or easy way to get myself to trust me, and while tipping my hand so early might only scare her more, I decided to throw a hail Mary.

I turned my flashlight on and pointed it at my face.

“Did you not notice that I sounded exactly like you?” I couldn’t help but snip to vent some of my frustration.

The reveal didn’t scare her off, thankfully, but it also didn’t seem to help. She simply stared motionless in absolute shock, unable to process what she was seeing.

The look on her face returned my empathy to me, and I let out a breath to cool off, doing another survey around the area, “I know that this is a lot to take in right now, but long story short, this place is not normal, and very, *very* dangerous. We need to get back to safety and I can explain everything. Please…”

If she was about to agree to that, I’ll never know because just then, a haunting, ghostly wail filled the streets. It was melodic, but positively chilling, like a bird's call at night. The ethereal sound was long and drawn out, bouncing off the vacant building walls and confusing me with its origin, so I began to pivot on my feet to cover every path of approach.

When I didn’t immediately see anything, I turned back to my newest half, “Hensley, we need to go right now.”

“What… what is that?” she asked, doing the same cautious dance on her heels that I was.

I didn’t answer that question, “Hensley; *Right. Now.*”

The wail tapered off into an echo again, then started up anew as Hensley 3 finally focused back in on me. I saw no trust in her eyes, but the fear of the unknown clearly was winning based on her expression. Slowly, she took a step toward me. Then another, and another.

She was going too slow for my liking, so I began to move toward her too, trying to meet her halfway. She was cautious as I approached, eyeing me up and down to check for threats, but when she saw that the only thing in my hand was a flashlight, she let me near. I had little concern for her feelings as I grabbed a hand holding the edge of her blanket and began to pull her along.

We didn’t make it far before the song lining the air stopped.

I halted with it. Such a sign could only spell danger and I needed to know where it was coming from before making any rash movements. After all, it could be right in front of us.

I stared straight forward, letting all of my brain power go to my hearing, then zoned in. Next to me, my clone trembled and gasped, still tired from running and shaken up from the fear. I did my best to ignore it and listen out to the streets beyond.

*Scriiiiiit.*

Something dragging across the road behind me.

I whipped around and shined my beam on instinct, and quickly wished I hadn’t.

Behind us, maybe 20 feet away, a head the size of my body hung in the darkness. It was almost perfectly round and covered in a collage of tattered grey fur and feathers. Two massive black orbs the size of basketballs bulged from its form, and stared straight at us, the light from my torch glistening in their wetness. Across its face, I could see something pale and cracked looking—some sort of beak, and when it opened it, it created a slit that spanned all five feet of its head.

The chilling wail that we’d been hearing moments ago hummed out once more, and the beast stood perfectly still. A predator waiting for its prey to dash.

The other Hensley turned around too when she saw me whip back, and before she could bother letting a scream out, I yanked her hard and took off down the road.

The last thing I caught before facing toward the tower again was the bird unfolding. Its body that had been obscured by darkness fanned out, revealing 6 pairs of wings that were gnarled and tattered into a horrific collage. Its body was a blurry mess of plumage that shifted and rippled with its wriggling movement as it began snaking over to us on its strong, tree-like legs. I imagine that the talons that sprouted from them would be enough to tear through metal.

The worst part was its mouth, though.

It unhinged straight back, almost obscuring its whole face and revealing a massive, gaping hole straight into its innards. I had no doubt that the thing could swallow us whole. If it hadn’t been for the lack of whispers and cracking bones, I wouldn’t have been blamed for thinking our day of reckoning with the beast from my dreams had finally come.

Or maybe it had, and this was it. Either way, I wasn’t going to stick around and let it eat me. I was practically dragging my clone along with me as my eyes focused on the red light above us; our fire in the raging flood.

It scared me how quiet things were as we ran. The beast didn’t scream or make any noise as it charged after us. The only sound was the pounding of our feet, the clicking of its nails on the asphalt behind us, and the chorus of our breath to the beat of our thundering hearts.

Hen 3 let out little desperate grunts with each step, clearly scared out of her mind, and anytime her body began lagging behind, I yanked her hand hard to keep up with me.

My bones ached by the time we cleared the block of the radio tower, and by that point, I was certain each step I took was going to be my last. We had been outrunning the monster for far too long, and there was no way that it was slower than us. This was confirmed by the sound of its nails scraping closer and closer with each rapid step.

I saw Hope ahead at the door of the building, shining her light our way and giving us a runway straight to the door. Her expression went frantic when she saw the monster chasing us, and she called out in a panic. It was really all she could do to help.

“Hen, don’t slow down!”

I know it was meant to encourage, but the raw frenzy of her voice told me that we didn’t have much time left. I let out a guttural cry of fear and adrenaline as I pushed my body to its absolute limit, feeling hot breath gasping against my back as a massive, open maw lingered right behind it. Hope stepped clear of the door for us to barrel through it, and as we floated up the steps of the building—

*BZZZZZZRRT!*

My teeth rattled in my skull as the sharp vibration filled the air. Me and my two clones crashed into the radio tower lobby then scurried away toward the back of it, only then stopping to look back toward the entrance. On the steps outside, the bird now lay screeching and thrashing, clawing at the air and snapping at the sound waves or whatever the hell the people of Kingfisher had to make to stop these nightmares from getting inside.

Eventually it wormed its way off the lot and back down to the road where it let out a scream of rage toward us. Hope and I stared dumbfounded at the sheer closeness of the situation for a moment before remembering there were other matters to attend.

New Hensley was staring teary eyed at the beast outside, holding herself and muttering prayers under her breath. Hope, being the caretaker that she is, moved over to make sure that she was alright, but the girl stepped back fast and her face went wild.

“D-Don’t touch me! What the fuck is going on here?! What is that thing and where am I and why do you both look like me?!”

The bird let out another loud screech which drew all of our attention, and Hope stepped to block her view, “We’re safe in here, don’t worry. Let’s get somewhere more calm to talk about this, okay?”

She began leading our new clone up stairs while I hung back for a moment, staring at the beast. It sucked that it saw us in here this time; the last time a creature saw that I was in this building, the light didn’t turn off for several days. That meant we were going to be here for a while. We gathered more food in preparation for the two new mouths to feed, but that wasn’t my concern.

The description of the beast from my dreams was so close to this thing that for a moment, I thought the barrier wouldn’t hold. We got lucky this time, but the signs that something unstoppable is coming are only getting worse and worse, and based on the dream that I had, it’s only a matter of time before it ‘catches our scent’. We don’t have time to spare waiting for beasts to screw off back into their hole. We already killed so much time waiting for the scientist to wake up, and that was all for nothing now…

Hope and I waited patiently while we let the third Hensley get dressed in the bathroom. She was in there a long time, but we didn’t rush her. She probably needed some time to herself after what had just happened to gather her bearings. When she did emerge, she no longer looked fearful. She had a stern, plain face that told us she was already fed up with the stress of the situation.

“Are you hungry?” Hope asked, holding out a bag of chips, “We have some water too if you—”

“I’m fine.” She said fast and coldly, “I just want to know what the hell is going on.”

“Um, right,” Hope awkwardly looked to me for help. I don’t think she knew how to handle such a strong personality.

“Here,” I said plainly, matching her energy. I handed her my phone that was open to all of my logs since I’ve been here, and since we had the time, she began to read.

While she read, I worked on cleaning the punctures from my wrist While Hope got a space for her to sleep. After that, we moved the scientist's body out of the room for now until we can decide what to do with it. It feels a little more grotesque since she’s a body that we knew when she was alive, but I think both of us know where we’re going to lay her to rest, and the drop is a lot deeper than 6 feet…

 After that, the two of us sort of twiddled our thumbs and waited. She was silent the whole time she read, never stopping to ask a question or audibly reacting to anything at all. Hope tried to avoid staring at her, but I kept my eyes on her from a comfortable distance to gauge what I could. Her face didn’t change much, and her eyes flickered to me a few times, but other than that, she kept her cards close to her chest.

Already, I began to get an uneasy feeling in my stomach. If Hope was all the best parts of myself, what did that make *this* version of me?

It took her a little over an hour to finish, and when she did, she haphazardly tossed our phone onto the desk next to her, then crossed her arms.

“What is this?”

Hope looked up at her, “Sorry?”

“What is this? This convoluted ass story?”

Hope turned to me for help, and I squinted at the new me in confusion, “Seriously? There’s literally two clones of yourself staring you in the face, it’s beyond pitch black outside, and we just got run down by a bird from hell—what do you mean ‘what is this’? You’re still in denial?”

“Hen, stop it, she’s just scared,” Hope chastised.

“No, I’m not scared,” Hensley the third snorted, “I’m just confused. This has to be a dream. Either that, or I got stuck by some crack-addict when I stopped for gas and now I’m tripping balls in the parking lot because *none* of this makes sense\*.\*”

“We know that,” Hope said softly, “It’s a lot to take in—I was confused too when I woke up.”

“Oh, so you must be Hope, then?” she snickered, “You’re our ‘good’ half?”

Hope turned to me with a bit of embarrassment, “That’s how you write about me too?”

“Look, there is no good half of us, sister,” Hensley cut back in, “And there’s no ‘alternate dimensions’ or ‘monsters’ or ‘secret organizations’ behind them all. That shit is for movies and nightmares, and we aren’t in a movie, which only leaves one option.”

I was already at my limit, and despite Hope’s request, I couldn’t ease up anymore. I already didn’t like myself at the best of times. These were not those times, and this copy of myself was acting all too familiar…

 “Look, if you think you’re dreaming, then you can sit here and wait all the time in the world to wake up. It’s not going to happen. Eventually though, something is coming back to this place to clean it out again, and if we’re here when it does, we’re fucked. So if you’re not going to help us look for an escape, you’d better go toss yourself to that bird downstairs because if you’d read a damn word of what I just showed you, you’d know that whatever is coming for us is a fate worse than death.”

 “*Hensley,*” Hope softly scolded.

I didn’t even bother turning to look at her. I just kept my eyes on the new me while she stared intensely back, unflinching. The tension was palpable, but I didn’t dare back down. I was going to show this new clone that I was just as much of a stubborn prick as she was. It seemed to work because the more she stared at me, the more I saw the muscles in her face begin to relax. Her jaw eased up, and her arms slipped back to rest on the desk behind her, and eventually, she spoke a single, defeated word.

“Fuck…”

It was so hopeless. Like her dam of denial had finally given way, and all the pain came out in that one word.

“*Fuck*… This is really happening then…”

I decided it was my turn to ease up too, “Yeah.” I offered, “I… I’m really sorry.”

“So what do we do, then? From what you just showed me, you two don’t even have a plan.”

“We’re trying to figure it out as we go,” Hope told her, “It’s really the only thing we can do. There’s not much to go off of here.”

She looked toward the door where she’d seen us take the body and nodded toward it, “That woman, she didn’t tell you anything?”

“Nothing that’s helpful to the situation,” I said.

“Well shit, there're more rigs, right? Doesn’t that mean there might be more scientists?”

“There could be,” Hope told her, “That rig was the only one that’s popped up so far, though.”

“Have you been to any of the other ones on the map?”

“We tried to go to one that wasn’t ready for harvest before Zane’s,” I said, “There was nothing there, though. Just a random, abandoned building.”

“Well, isn’t that great? So we just have to wait for these things to pop up for us? How long is that going to take?”

“I don’t know.” I told her, “But for the time being, we’re held up anyway until that thing outside decides to leave.”

“For fuck's sake…” Hensley muttered, placing her head into her hands.

“It’s going to be okay,” Hope said, trying to keep the peace, “We’ll figure it out. These people had time to get entire facilities set up before that monster came and threw a wrench in the mix. Then, they had even longer to find a way to escape before it came back again. Well, at least for one of them to. The point is, we have time, and if we panic and rush, it’s only going to make things worse. That thing probably won’t be rushing up to kill us tomorrow or even the next day.”

New Hensley Scoffed, “Yeah? And what about our track record of luck in life has given you the impression that *wouldn’t* happen?”

Hope didn’t have a response, still ill-equipped to deal with negativity, but I was able to step in and help when I noticed something glinting in the dark. It was lying on the pile of bloody sheets that we’d just removed a corpse from.

Bending over, I picked up the small piece of plastic with a lanyard attached. It must have broke loose in the woman’s thrashing.

“Well, maybe we got a little luck on our side,” I said aloud, holding it up for the girls to see, “And maybe getting that woman out wasn’t a total loss,” I addressed to Hope.

In my hand, I held a Kingfisher access keycard.
