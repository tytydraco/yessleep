Who knew that myths, the silly stories I always heard from ancient history, were more nightmarish than I could have ever imagined? The sacrifice my friend thought she was making as she put us into that pit turned out to be much greater than she could ever know, a hellish memory I continue to relive, and one that I will never escape. I’m glad though. So glad that she got what she deserved in the end.

"The forest looks so beautiful in the morning sunlight," Alice said, admiring the verdant foliage around our group. And it really did, considering we were finally escaping the winter that just couldn't seem to let go of Oregon. Other than the distant songs of chirping birds, there was stillness and silence in the woods I've always been unable to find anywhere else. It brings a time to reflect and meditate, away from the stresses of work and everyday distractions.

"Yeah, I'm glad the nice weather decided to grace us on a Sunday this time. Finally," replied Ryan. As we walked, the sound of our footsteps crunching on the leaves and twigs filled the air. I was still a little sleepy from getting up so early that morning, but at least I was able to sleep in the car on the long drive here. *Not very many animals so far*, I thought to myself, hoping to see something. *Too bad, this is probably the only time we might actually not scare away any wildlife.*

Our group is usually the loud and obnoxious group of young adults you might run into at the amusement park or bar, but that day was different from usual. We all knew why we were on the hike; there was an invisible blanket of respect and reverence on all of us. Megan's little sister was diagnosed with a brain tumor on September 21st, and she had slowly worsened… At that point it was the disheartening reality that she could pass away at any time.

I remember that day because it was my little brother's birthday, and as I was driving to meet my family for bowling, I received the phone call from Megan. She's the type who is always outgoing and always smiling, so that was the first time I had ever heard her cry hysterically like that. For as long as I've known her, she and Emma were the two closest siblings I had ever seen, despite their almost 7-year age gap. They were seemingly always together, doing each other's hair, cooking, or playing their favorite card games. Emma has even mingled with our group on several occasions and has come to fit in as her own small puzzle piece of our team. I assume that's why she invited all of us on this trip instead of just going by herself, to get away from it all for just a few hours.

"Ah yeah! Let's do it!" Tanner's yell awakened me from my daydreaming, and he pushed past me, running down the trail. As I looked ahead, at first, I couldn't tell what he was talking about. Then I saw it: a small cave with moss hanging off the sides of the entrance, nestled in the side of the hill that our trail was looping around. Ryan was right behind him in no time, saying "Oh sick! Good eye, Megan!" I sighed and looked at Alice, who just shrugged her shoulders and picked up the pace. It was off the trail by a good bit, maybe 400 feet or so, but there wasn’t a drastic amount of foliage on the ground yet, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult to get back.

I followed them through the brush, stepping over sticks and logs. I glanced back at Megan, who was quietly following with her eyes pointed at the ground. *Poor girl has hardly said a thing all day. I can't imagine what she must be going through*, I thought to myself. I was almost to the cave entrance when something bright red from the corner of my eye caught my attention. I turned and saw the vibrant color peeking through the leaves of a large bush. I walked over to it and realized that a small patch of red tape was nestled within the lush greenery. I pulled it out and the words ‘danger, do not ent’ were written, with the last word being cut off. I glanced back to the entrance of the cave to see Megan watching me before quickly darting inside the cave.

The sunlight cast on the jagged rocks and uneven terrain. My friends were wandering around, looking at the walls, but it was so dark I doubted they would be able to see whatever moss or rocks they wanted to investigate anyway. As I took a few steps further in, the air quickly became thick and damp. "This thing probably goes on for a while," I said to the others. A ray of light appeared, and I looked over at Tanner, who now had his cell phone flashlight on. He pointed it down the cave, which sure enough seemed to continue onward for who knows how long.

*Cold and dark. My favorite.* I began making my way outside and told the others that I would meet them out there when Megan asked, "Actually, can we check it out a little bit? Just for a minute, and then we can get back on the trail?" I pulled out my phone. It was 11:30 in the morning. *How does time go by so fast when you're just walking around?* "Sure. I'm fine with that." *We’ll probably have lunch in a little bit and then another 2 hours or so until we reach the end of the trail.* We all flipped on our flashlight apps and started making our way down the cave.

Other than the occasional drop of water from the ceiling and the sound of our footsteps, the cave was quiet and empty. Whenever I pointed my flashlight at the wall it gave off a soft glimmer. I pointed it down the cave and began making my way down while staying by the wall in case I slipped. There were small ledges to step down every so often, and one of my friends' feet skittered behind me. After a minute, I started to slow down, looking at the wall and hoping the rest of the group would get the hint that I was ready to turn around. I was just an empty cave; seeing a bat would be cool, but I didn’t think the odds were very high for that to happen. The rest of the group walked past me, ready to look at more wet, black cave wall.

Without pointing my flashlight, I turned and looked over at Ryan and Alice, who were now walking side by side, holding hands. Ryan was talking about his rock collection from when he was a kid. They had only been dating for a few weeks at that point, but they were really getting along well; it had been nice to see. Ryan was an absolute goofball who has always been more into the high-maintenance types of girls, and this would always leave him with a few scars after they decided to chase after some other popular guy. Alice was smiling. *I think she appreciates Ryan’s passion for what is probably a $15 box of ordinary rocks.* I smiled a bit too. *This isn't so bad.*

I looked over at Megan, who was to my right. She was still looking at the floor, probably what I should’ve been doing with how many little jagged rocks there were. "Have you ever been to the Ape caves?" She lifted her head and then turned over to me. "Huh?" "The caves that go on for miles, I guess they were created by magma like thousands of years ago. They're pitch black like this one. I don't know why they call them ape caves because apes definitely don't live down there. Heck, I don't know why anything would want to live down in one of these things." She cracked a small smile and then turned back toward the ground. "No, it sounds cool, though." "Yeah, my family used to go there every so often. It was pretty cool being down there and then turning off your flashlight to experience just how dark it was. If everyone turned off their lights, you wouldn't even see your hands waved in front of your face." "Cool," she replied.

“Woah!” Ryan yelled, now ahead of the group by himself. “What’s up?” I shouted in reply. “There’s a big hole over here!” Knowing Ryan, I upgraded my slow walk into a light jog before he fell in. I reached him and sure enough, carved into the wall of this cave was an etched out rectangular section with a small path inside. It was narrow, and the walls on either side were smooth. From where we were all standing we could see that a few steps in, the path suddenly emptied into a pit.

A sudden feeling of dread passed over me. I don’t like this. “I think it says something?” I looked back at Alice who was looking above the entrance, now pointing her light at it. I looked up and saw the writing etched into the stone on a slab. After a few seconds of staring at it, Tanner made an attempt. “I have no freaking idea, that’s way too worn down. It’s like…  ‘away zinc’...? Or maybe ‘okie dokie’ something?” We all squinted our eyes, trying to decipher the faded inscription. It was clear that time has taken its toll on the carved words. Suddenly, Megan stepped forward, raising her hand enough where she could reach the inscription. "Let me give it a try," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She traced her finger along the grooves of the ancient writing, looking at it.

"Ἅψαι ζωῆς ἢ παραδοῦναι θανάτῳ" she pronounced, her eyes locked on the mysterious words. The cave seemed to hold its breath as Megan's voice echoed through the air. The words she spoke felt ancient, like it carries a weight of history and meaning that we couldn’t comprehend. The silence that follows her recitation is eerie, as if the cave itself is waiting for a response.

"Annnnnnd, what does it mean?" I asked, breaking the stillness that had settled upon us. Megan took a step back. She stood there for a moment, and then looked at us with what seemed to be a somber, sad expression, although it was difficult to tell in the dark. Her face then changed to stern as she said "I'm not sure. It's Greek, but the meaning isn't clear to me. It's something like 'Cave of a million treasures' but I can't be certain." Ryan let out a wheezing laugh and then while smiling exclaimed "WHAT? Yeah freaking right, that's the cave right out of ‘Aladdin’. You can't read it!" Alice threw a sharp look at him and punched him in the ribs which he proceeded to hunch over from with an "oof". I looked back over at Megan, who was now looking back at the ground. *She doesn't seem to be in a very jokey mood today. She has been studying Greek recently, but I thought it was more of the stories and culture, not the language.*

"Nah Tanner, she's been studying Greek, remember? It's probably one of you guys playing a prank." Everyone just stood there, now shivering because we all had dressed for our day in the 80-degree forest. No one looked less shocked than anyone else. "Tanner?" He threw his hands up in the air and sarcastically replied "Oh yeah, I totally got in my truck last night after Megan texted us which hike we were going to do, drove the 3 hours to get here, and then at 2 o'clock in the morning I guessed you would all wonder into this cave and I wrote this into the wall. Gotcha!" He was right, there was no way. *None of us even knew we were going to be here until last night -  someone else must have written it into the wall a while ago for fun. After all, what would a Greek inscription be doing in the middle of Oregon?*

"Whatever it is, I'm going in," Ryan said as he recovered and fixed his posture.  With his arms extended to maintain balance, phone in hand, he cautiously proceeded down the incline. Alice, following behind, urged him to be careful. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. "Great, it can't ever be just a normal hike. First we need to go on the closed off trail, and then we need to go into the dark cold cave, and then into the creepy cave within the cave," I muttered under my breath. I began to follow, but my curiosity switched back to that feeling of dread I had a minute ago. *What if someone gets hurt? What if our phones suddenly all die and we're all trapped down here in the dark?* “Guys, we should probably just get back to the trail, someone could get hurt." Tanner walked past me and said "This will just take a minute, and then we’ll go back. Maybe there's a cool hobo camp in here or something." Megan followed him in, and I let out a sigh. *Someone always gets hurt on our adventures. Every. Single. Time. Hopefully, it just turns about to be a sprained ankle.*

"Woah!" Tanner shouted from inside. As I approached the slope in the hallway, I carefully adjusted my stride so I could balance between not slipping and avoiding any head-on collisions with the low ceiling. It was farther down than I thought and after at least 30 seconds I finally made it to where the floor flattened out again. The rest of the group was just ahead of me, inspecting the walls with their flashlights in the dark. The walls immediately caught my attention. Just like the entrance, it was unnaturally flat and smooth, lacking the rugged texture of the natural cave formations. *It’s a hallway… this has to be man made*, I thought to myself. There were metal stands in the wall, each with a dish on the top just across from one another every few feet. “It's like we stumbled upon some hidden underground passage or something”. I looked over at Ryan, who was poking at one of the metal pieces. Ryan's curious fingers traced the cold, metallic surface of the stand. "What do you think these are for?" he wondered aloud. "I think they're torch stands," Alice answered.

I walked past them and squinted my eyes, trying to perceive what was ahead. The hallway was completely pitch black. I continued onward, glancing up and down the wall trying to make sense of what the hallway was used for, until I noticed something reflecting light back at me. It was a curvy square, situated between two torch stands with some kind of picture in the middle. *Dusty*. I brushed it off to reveal a framed photo. The hazily colored image depicted a group of individuals, their ancient Greek attire unmistakable, standing in a semicircle around the entrance of our cave. But the cave was different—no trace of moss, instead adorned with strange symbols and inscriptions. Stone spires loomed on either side, like silent sentinels guarding the entrance. In the photograph, the group appeared to be caught in a moment of jubilant celebration. Balloons bobbed in the air, and confetti carpeted the ground. But my eyes were drawn to a figure standing in the center—a tall, muscular man clad in armor, gripping a spear with an air of authority and confidence. However, it was others in the photo who unsettled me. A young woman and two boys stood beside him, their expressions devoid of joy. Their eyes spoke of sorrow and terror, with the youngest boy seemingly teetered on the brink of tears. *What is this, some kind of… larping? Why does it feel so real?*

My eyes began scanning the wall while searching for another frame when I stepped on something with a \**crunch*\*. I looked down, and sure enough there lay another frame. I wiped away the veil of dust, revealing another photograph. It mirrored the previous one, captured from the exact same angle, frozen in time as if the photographer hadn't dared to move. But this image told a different story—one of fierce confrontation. Several men in armor, reminiscent of the first photo, engaged in a furious shouting match. The sky above was cloaked in ominous clouds, casting an eerie pallor over the scene. The plants in the picture also seemed different, and some of the rocks were in different spots. I moved onto the next spot on the wall. This one was difficult to see because this photo was taken at night, but it seemed to be taken again at the same angle. All I could really see is a single silhouette walking into the cave, holding a torch. I continued walking. The next photograph was similar to the first, a group of people celebrating some kind of event for a soldier. Just as the first, a scared family stood around him. The next photo was of a line of men… wearing chains… surrounded by guards who have spears pointed at them, as if telling them to walk into the cave or be killed. Another photo displayed a younger man with a bow and arrows on his back hugging an older man, who looked frail and sick. Shivers ran down my spine.

Unease settled over me as I took in the cryptic dangers that may lie ahead. The air was beginning to feel more heavy and stagnant, carrying with it a musty scent that hinted at the passage's age and abandonment. The gray walls began to get to me, causing me to feel confined and squished. "Guys, this place feels... wrong, like we're trespassing somewhere we shouldn't be. We should get -" Without warning, Megan, who was still at the back of the group, bolted down the hall towards the way we came in. Her sudden movement caught us all off guard, and for a moment, we stood frozen in shock. "Megan, wait! What are you doing?" Ryan called out, his voice tinged with concern. But it was too late. Megan reached the entrance and suddenly started apologizing profusely. "I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!" I began sprinting for the entrance, confused but too terrified to wait and see what she was talking about.

As I got closer to her, my adrenaline suddenly pumping so hard I could see my eyelids throbbing, I realized it was…CLOSING. "I'm so sorry," she cried out, her words a painful admission of betrayal. Her voice quivered as she began to cry. I was about to reach the end but at that point only a crack of the entrance remained. Megan's face appeared through it. "It's for my sister, please forgive me! Kill it! You guys can kill it!" Tears were streaming down her face, and she grunted as she pushed the entrance shut the rest of the way. "NO!! MEGAN! LET US OUT!" The rest of the group caught up with me. "What the hell!" "Holy shit, this CANNOT be happening!" Ryan and Tanner start pulling at the entrance and I join. After it became obvious that it wouldn’t budge, Tanner began kicking at it. I looked at Alice who was now the only one holding a flashlight. Her eyes were wide, her face reflecting the shock we were all experiencing. My heart was pounding out of my chest, panic coursing through my veins. *What just happened. What the HELL just happened?* "NO!! NO MEGAN, GET US OUT OF HERE, THIS ISN'T FUNNY!" Tanner screamed. ["WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!?"](https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderdonetoastHorror)
