The sun had begun its slow descent when his mother left him on the swing, promising she’d be back with some juice. He watched her retreating figure, her thin frame disappearing into the thick trees, leaving him alone in the abandoned play area nestled in the woods. The place barely resembled a playground—rusted monkey bars bent like broken ribs, a splintered slide lay on its side like a toppled gravestone, and the wooden swings creaked with every gust of wind, whispering secrets only the dead could hear.

He kicked his little legs absently, his bare feet peeking through the holes in his socks. His shorts were too small, frayed at the hems, and his t-shirt—once white—was now a muddied shade of gray. His stomach grumbled from the meager lunch that now felt like a distant memory.

*They were going on a picnic. That’s what Mama had said. He thought they would go to the park near their home, maybe feed the birds, but instead, she took him to the bus stop. The ride was long, the seats scratchy, and when they finally got down, there was no park—just the looming edge of the woods. They walked for what felt like forever. His tiny legs ached, and he whined, but Mama kept saying, ‘just a little further.’*

At last, they reached an abandoned playground, long forgotten and swallowed by the woods. The swings creaked weakly in the wind, the slide lay toppled and broken, and the monkey bars were corroded with rust. It didn’t matter. **He was thrilled.** They ate their lunch on a splintered bench—half a sandwich each, a bruised apple, and lukewarm water. Then, he played until the sun dipped low. Mama didn’t join him. She sat on the bench, staring at nothing, looking bored. But he didn’t mind. He got to have the whole park to himself, which never happened anymore.

*He used to go to the park all the time when Grandma was around. She would take him after school, pushing him on the swing, clapping when he slid down the slide. But Grandma wasn’t here anymore. Mama said, she had gone to sleep and didn’t wake up. He had asked when she would wake up, but no one gave him an answer. Since then, park visits had become rare.*

Time stretched thin. The woods grew quieter. No birds, no insects, just the oppressive silence creeping in like a thick fog. He clenched his small fists around the rusted chains of the swing. Something rustled in the bushes.

Then, laughter.

Not joyful. Not human.

His breath hitched. Movement in the bushes. Little feet peeking through the tangled undergrowth. His pulse pounded as he slid off the swing and crept closer.

*Another child? Maybe they were lost too?*

He took a hesitant step forward. The bushes shuddered, branches cracking. He swallowed hard and reached out to push the foliage aside.

*Nothing*. Just the empty hush of the trees swaying gently in the dying light. He turned back—

A translucent face of a child loomed inches from his own.

Hollow eyes. A smile frozen in place.

A scream caught in his throat as he stumbled backward, his legs tangling beneath him. The world tilted.

A chorus of high-pitched giggles erupted around him, distorted and wrong, slipping through the trees like fingers reaching for him. His breath came in ragged gasps as he scrambled back to his feet.

His chest felt tight, breath quick and shallow. He needed to find his mother—**now.** The shadows were stretching, reaching, and something was moving between them.

“Mama?” His voice barely left his throat.

The giggles stopped.

Then he saw her.

A woman, half-hidden between the trees, watching him. Her face was obscured by the dying light, but something about her felt… familiar. She raised a hand and beckoned.

*Mama?*

Relief washed over him like a warm tide—his mother was here. She was taking him home. He knew it. *He had nothing to worry about.*

He slid off the swing and followed. She moved deeper into the trees, her figure barely visible. The moment he stepped off the dirt path, the air changed—heavy, suffocating.

He heard tiny footsteps behind him.

He turned, but there was no one. Still, the weight of unseen hands brushed his shoulders.

Heart gripped with fear, he quickened his pace, his breath hitching with every step. The unseen presence behind him grew heavier, pressing against his spine like icy fingers tracing his bones.

The woman ahead glided through the trees, her feet not quite touching the ground.

“Mama?” His little voice trembled. Slowly, he stretched out his hand, fingers reaching for hers.

She turned her head slightly, just enough for him to see the curve of her cheek. It was familiar. Comforting. But then she smiled. Too wide. Too sharp. And the calm he felt twisted into something else—something cold.

He pulled his hand back, though only moments ago, he had been reaching for her.

The frantic whispering started again.

Tiny fingers clawed at his arms, his back.

Whispers.

Cries.

A chorus of small voices sobbing, pleading. *Don’t go… Stop... Stay... DON’T GO—*

He stumbled, shaking off unseen hands, his own palms pressing against his ears. “Stop! Stop it!”

He wanted to rush behind the woman. The voices will stop if he joins her, his fluttering little heart told him. But when he looked up, the woman was gone.

Darkness thickened.

And then—

A firm grip yanked him backward.

His breath caught as his feet scraped against the loose dirt. The realization struck like a bolt of ice—just a few steps ahead, the ground simply ended. A jagged drop stretched into darkness; the sharp rocks below barely visible in the moonlight. If he had gone any further, he wouldn’t have stopped falling.

Desperately, he held onto the only thing that felt real at that moment—the hand that had yanked him backward. Shaking, he twisted and met the terrified gaze of a man. The man’s grip on his arm was tight, desperate. “Are you okay?”

“My—my mama—” He pointed toward the cliff.

“There’s no one there,” the man said, his voice hoarse. “It’s just us.”

*But that wasn’t true.*

The whispers surrounded them. The crying continued. But there was also laughter. Laughter of relief, he thought. The shadows were dissipating. *He was safe.*

The man—his name was David—led him away, back to his small campsite where a dim fire crackled weakly. He wrapped the boy in a too-big jacket, handed him a bottle of water, and gave him something to eat. He barely tasted it. His body shivered, not from cold, but from something deeper. Something old.

David didn’t leave his side all night.

**It has been twenty years since that night, but I still wake up with the sound of those children crying ringing in my ears.**

I learned the truth years later, when I was old enough to understand.

My mother hadn’t been able to care for me. She wanted a life without a child weighing her down. My father was a ghost—a fleeting name on child support papers, payments arriving sporadically until he got a new family, one that mattered.

For a while, my maternal grandmother helped raise me. But when she passed, my mother was left alone with a seven-year-old who needed food, love, and attention—things she had no patience for. It was too much for her. So, she took me to that place, knowing she wouldn’t return.

That hill—those woods—had a story of their own.

Seventy-five years ago, a wealthy man built a special school at the edge of the forest—a place for children no one else wanted. Some were different, their minds working in ways their parents didn’t understand. Others were disabled, too much trouble for families who saw them as burdens. Back then, society had little patience for those who didn’t fit neatly into its mold. The school was meant to give them a home, a future. And for a while, it did.

As long as the rich man lived, the school thrived. Donations poured in, the children were cared for, those who were able to, were rehabilitated and there was hope. But when he died, the money stopped. And with it, kindness. That was when the matron found her own way to manage things.

If a child was sick, if they required too much effort, if they were being "difficult"—she took them into the woods. They never came back. The bodies were never found, but the stories remained.

No one paid attention to a missing child. Who would? Few were willing to take them home. Fewer still cared enough to ask questions.

But one day, someone started asking questions—someone who wouldn’t let it go. Whispers turned to murmurs, and murmurs grew into accusations. The other staff, who had long stayed silent out of fear, finally spoke. They didn’t know the full truth, but they knew this: the matron took children to the park in the woods, and not all of them returned.

That was enough.

Suspicion crept in like rot through the town and festered anger. The authorities came. They searched the grounds, the records, the woods. But the years had buried her secrets well. No graves were found, no proof of what had been done. Only empty beds and missing names.

People wanted to shut down the school, but fate had something else in mind.

People in the town, and parents who had once abandoned their children now demanded justice. They had left their little ones to fate, never looking back—but now, with blood on the matron’s hands, they needed someone to blame. Guilt twisted into righteous fury.

A mob gathered outside the school, voices rising like a storm. Then, they broke in. Stones flew, fists struck, screams echoed through the halls where children had once wept in silence. The matron, a monster in human skin, perished beneath the weight of their wrath.

Only then did the crowd fall silent. But justice, if that was what it was, did not bring peace. It only left behind an empty school, a nameless grave, and stories that refused to die.

People spat on the ground when they spoke of her. They gave her dark names—The Butcher of the Forgotten, The Hag of Hollow Hill, The Crone in White.

The newspapers were less poetic but no less cruel. The Mercy Killer, some called her. The Matron of No Return.

I followed *her* into the trees that day.

I was supposed to be another body in the earth.

The children—her victims—the ones abandoned by society thought of me as their kin. They must have sensed the pain from abandonment slowly creeping in my heart, the one I was too young to acknowledge.  I think when they saw sitting alone on the swing, they surrounded me to protect me. And when she tried luring me to the cliff, they tried to stop me.

And David… David had heard them. A paranormal investigator with a growing obsession for the unexplained, he wanted to start a YouTube channel dedicated to hauntings. That night, in what might have been fate—or something else guiding him—he camped at the trekking ground near the woods, hoping to capture eerie whispers or cold spots on camera. The forest had long been abandoned, avoided by locals due to the orphanage’s grim past, but trekkers still passed through its edges. David hadn’t expected much, maybe a flickering EMF reading or a rustling sound in the underbrush.

Instead, he heard ***them***.

Disembodied whispers. Cries for help. Faint voices calling in the night. And when he followed, camera in hand, they led him to me—a small boy walking toward the cliff’s edge, mesmerized by something David couldn’t see.

He called the cops the next day, and from there, things took a better turn. My mother was charged with child abandonment, and they began searching for my next of kin. That’s when my father’s sister—who had always known of me but never stepped in—came forward. Maybe it was out of love. Maybe it was guilt. Either way, she took me in.

But I lived and thrived.

I never saw my mother after that day. My aunt and her family loved and nurtured me. I grew up to be a well-adjusted man—or so I tell myself. But once in a while, I still dream about that night. I wake up drenched in sweat, haunted by whispers of the ghost children that take me back to that eerie, silent night when I was almost lured to my death by the ghost of the matron.

And on those nights, I close my eyes and whisper into the dark:

["Thank you."](https://medium.com/@preetb511)
