I received a message from a strange unknown number. The first message he sent was, "I miss you, man." When I replied, asking, "Who are you?!" he seemed shocked. He exclaimed, "HOW THE FUCK DID YOU ANSWER?" At first, I couldn't comprehend his reaction. But then it dawned on both of us: his friend's SIM card had been inactive for too long, so the company reassigned it to another person—me. He had kept his deceased friend's number to send messages like this from time to time. 

He asked for my name, but he couldn't believe it when I answered, especially after I sent a voice message. "My name's Omar," I said. He replied, "That's literally my dead friend's name, and your voice sounds just like his!" He attempted to call me, but neither of us could hear anything during the call, so we continued messaging.

He introduced himself as Kareem Adham. He and Omar had been best friends for around a year and a few months. Although it wasn't a long period, their bond was strong. Kareem revealed that four months before Omar's death, he confided in him about seeing headless ghosts and strange entities lurking in the darkness of his house. Omar never shared this with anyone else. His mental state deteriorated, and he barely slept for two hours a day. I remember that day well.

At 2:30 in the morning, Omar messaged me in a hushed tone: "Kareem, I'm hiding in the closet. These ghosts have gone insane. The electricity went out, and there are three of them in the room. A child, about nine years old, repeatedly hits her head against the corner. A headless man sits motionless on my bed, and a grown woman circles, screaming with a decaying body. They used to vanish after a few minutes, but not today..." Suddenly, the call went silent. I kept asking Omar what happened while rushing to his house. He whispered, tears streaming down his face, "Kareem, I think the woman saw me. She stopped screaming and is staring at the closet. Please, hurry! She's trying to peek through the holes." I assured him, "I'm on my way, Omar. Don't do anything rash. Stay there." I doubted his words, thinking he might be delusional and fearing he'd harm himself. When I arrived, I found his lifeless body on the floor, bones shattered. He had jumped off the roof and taken his own life. or at least‚ that's what the cops thought.

That marked the end of Omar's story. I didn't want to believe him, but the weird ghosts in his story was just like the things i started to see for a short moment in the darkness of my house... I turned off my phone, unwilling to learn more. I convinced myself it was a prank by a friend, yet I had never shared my experiences with anyone. The next day, I asked Omar, "When did you meet your friend Kareem?" He replied after a pause, "On my first day of the English course, May 17th." That's when I lost my sanity. Today, May 17th, is my first day in the English course. As I left home for school, I met a guy in the class who said, "Hey, are you in Mr. *****'s English course too? Nice to meet you. My name is Kareem Adham."
