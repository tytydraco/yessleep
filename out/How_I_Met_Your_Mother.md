Kids, I think it's time I sat you down and told you the story of how I met your mother.

I KNOW, I KNOW, but calm your childish glee for just one moment and allow me to paint for you a canvas. One of action and adventure! But also of loneliness, depravity and cockroaches. This was the life of I, YOUR FATHER! THE MAN YOU SEE BEFORE YOU WHOSE LOINS PLANTED THE SEED THAT BORE THE FRUIT THAT IS YOU! MY BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN!

No, no, this is important to the story. Hush now!

Your mother was a beautiful, bountiful woman of fair skin and thick, lively hair. But then, you know that, as she is alive and currently preparing our dinner.

I apologize, my tiny ones! Do not be frightened, for I am YOUR FATHER, AND HAVE SWORN NEVER TO ACT IN ANY WAY WHICH COULD HARM YOU, AND THEREBY BRING HER SADNESS. I will calm myself, so that the distortions in your perception will alarm you no longer.

For you see, I did not always wish for the companionship of mortals. It was through great personal *strife, anguish, and a  s e e m i n g l y   e n d l e s s  c y c l e  o f   t o r m e n t e d  s e l f - m a n i p u l a t i o n* that I learned to love *just one; YOUR RADIANT MOTHER!*

It began as it always did. A Bump in the night. A *C REEEEAEEEAK* from the floorboards in the attic. I was merely watching, as I was want to do. I could do it QUITE proficiently, in-fact. Over the MANY YEARS of my watching, I had developed a knack so strong that I could *SLIIIP BETWEEN THE WALLS, where the SHADOWS are DARKEST, and watch to my soul's content.* If I watched intently enough, and for long enough, *they could even begin to see ME. This made them... untoward.*

 *I could watch many at once, AND OH BELIEVE YOU ME, I DID.*

THOUSANDS.

*MILLIONS.*

Until that night, of course. I had found myself watching, and for what felt like MILLENIA. This one, however... was so *different* from the others. She had long since begun to witness me.

HAH! I lost my composure again, FORESHAME ON YOUR FATHER!

Anyway, your father was... *not the man that he is today* when your mother first saw him. He was scarcely even a 'he' at all. Just a long tall shadow and a face that should have made your mother *weep.* And yet, she didn't. For you see, now is where *PHILLIP* comes into this tale. With a blackened, smoky tongue he would arrive in the night-- knocking your mother's  front door nearly from its hinges with his *putrid meaty fists.* His breath smelled of FUEL, that which propelled long, sharp vehicles. And every night, her gaze would drift toward me as he would... subject her. Brutally, he struck. And in her eyes, I saw something -- I *FELT* something.

This was *extremely* unusual. Not only did those who met my gaze seem to *quite* dislike it, but I *certainly* had never *FELT* anything for any of them other than dark, ominous k̴̡͔̺̟͓̖̩͍͍̆̽̽͒̾͠ń̸̝̏̌̑̄͐̏͝o̵͍̝͗͆̄͋̃̔̇w̸̖̾̾ị̴̡̛̞̝̖͊̌̐͐̓̚͝ͅñ̸͜g̵̨͚̲͉͠.

And yet, here was I! ^(THE MANIFEST FORM OF)YOUR FATHER! FEELING for YOUR MOTHER !

Were it fate or fortune that made me *feel for your mother* that she *must* have done *nothing* which could warrant *not only the torment of MY presence, but ALSO the SHEER INHUMANITY of* ***Ṗ̸̡̡̛͚͈͈̙̜̗̞̥̜͔̘̼̪͜͠H̷̡̛̛͑̽̃͆͗̇̄̀͗̎̈̿́̿̃̈́͠Ì̷̢̛̭̗̮̞͓̳̥̰̜̤̲̻̭̦͉͎̔͌͌̅͂̊͘͜L̶̨̧̧̯͖͚̩̭̝̻͍̖͚̜͈̻͈͔͕̖̱̮̞̙̥̉̾̐̓͆͌̍̓̉̌̈́́͌̀́̈́̔̆̄̚͝͝Ļ̴̧̛̛͚̮̲͉̯̱̟̦͖̙̮͇͖̤͍͎͎͎̪̭͔́̀̋̓̔͆̄̂̀͗̉͑̍̾̔͗͌̑̂͗͒͂͊̒̕͘͘͠ͅĮ̵̢̩͉̞̩̰̺̺̜͈̰̫͕̝̠͗̓̑͂͂͜͠P̴̨̥̙͕͍̞̬̦̫̞̰̤͉̖͕̜̼͔̍͋̐̈́͐̽̈̇̊̿̔̓̆̆̓̌̈́̅̾͐̅̆̔̍̓̀͊̕͝͝.***

She cried for a moment, and yet she was smiling -- relieved, even. She reached out and touched my face...
