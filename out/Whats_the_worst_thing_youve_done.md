Upon answering this question, many people would say the worst thing that they've ever done in their life, was nicking a candy bar from the shop. Or, using their parents bank card to go on a shopping spree when they were a teen. But nothing could compare, to what I did when I was thirteen years old, some ten years ago. Despite it being ten years ago, I still haven't gotten over it, it replays in my mind every day. I've been sent to asylums, because whenever I tell people what happened, they think I'm insane. But since in this app, people believe in all crazy stuff, ranging from ghosts and demons, I hope Ya'll believe my every word.

Anyways. My name is Brandon Willis, and when I was thirteen years old, I moved with my mother all the way from Minnesota to Louisiana. This was all because, my mum had a nasty break up with my father, and he threatened to gun us down then kill himself. So, my mum called the police on him, and whilst he was in jail, we moved states away, so that he won't try anything when he gets back from jail. No wonder why I was such a timid kid, who would be blame me for a childhood like that. 'Will we ever see dad again?' I asked mum, whilst we were on the plane. I was sitting on the seat by the window, almost too the brink of tears. My mum shook her head, 'he isn't well, Brandon. It's for our wellbeing that we distance ourselves from him' with that, she returned to her book, and didn't utter another word during the whole plane ride. The plane had to stop a couple of times, to refuel itself, and I didn't get much sleep on the plane, the seat was to uncomfortable.

When we finally got to Louisiana, New Orleans, we were met at the airport by my aunt, Leah, with open arms . We were to live at her apartment, until mum had enough money to afford a house. Unfortunately, her apartment, had only one bedroom, so me and my mum had to sleep on the sofa which was a pain in the ass. A couple of days later, I was enrolled in the Local Highschool, Riverbane high. I had to mentally prepare myself, before I went onto that yellow school bus. 'You'd be fine Brandon' mum said, before I left the house. 'I hope you make friends' when I went to the bus, it was crowded with loads of kids, chattering amongst themselves, and I had no idea were to sit. I evantually found a seat at the back, which was next to the window.

I was fumbling with my hands nervously, going to a new school is terrifying. I seemed to catch the attention of the two boys sitting in front of me, they looked back at me. 'Ayo! whos that?' one of the boy said, 'a newbie' the other boy said. 'H-hi' I stammered, feeling intimidated. 'I'm Brandon what's your names?' 'Im Trevon' the dark-skinned boy said, and then gestured to his blonde friend next to him. 'This is Connor' I nodded, and smiled, relieved that I got to know some people from that school. 'Yo look at his glasses' a boy with dark brown hair said, who was sitting on the opposite side. 'Looks like mans gonna be the new Jorge!'

'Jorge?' I said, visibly confused. 'Jorge is some nerd that disappeared like 3 months ago' Trevon said, he then pointed at me and grinned. 'And since he's gone, we've got our eyes on you!' Boy, did they keep their word, they made my school life hell, for absolutely no reason. Every day, they would torment me. Humiliating me on the school bus, by putting gum in my hair or tripping me over, locking me into lockers and leaving me there for the whole school period, chatting shit and creating fights against me and other people. All this, because I wore glasses, was the new kid, and their 'toy' vanished like 3 months ago. Trevon, Connor, and that dark haired boy who I evantually learnt who's name was Chris, made my life a living hell.

None of the teachers cared, despite my mum storming to the school several times, demanding these boys be punished. The teachers simply said, 'Brandon just got to man up'. My mum had enough and was going to enrol me into another local high school, but it would take ages for me to enroll so I had to deal with Trevon and his terrible gang. Whenever I pass the pole, were Jorge Barr's picture is, which has big black letters on it that says MISSING, I think to myself, could it be that Trevon and his terrible gang were involved in his disappearance. I better get out of the school quickly, before I end up like Jorge Barr.

After school, I didnt bother taking the school buss, and as I was about to walk, something hard banged my head. 'ARGH!' I shrieked, and fell down on my knees, putting a hand to the back of my head. The object that hit me, was a trainer, and to my horror I realized it was Trevons trainer. 'Yo!' Connor shrieked, and grabbed me by the collar. 'Get your ass up, geek!' I timidly, stood up, wobbling a bit. In front of me, was the terrible gang, with smug looks on their faces. 'Give me my trainer, loner!' Trevon said, smirking. I clenched my fist, and bent down to grab his trainer by the shoelace, as I bent down, one of the boys kicked my but. I fell down, tears streaming from my eyelids. 'Ah! You gonna cry!' Chris said, and the boys laughed amongst themselves. 'He's such a little girl, crying like that. WAWA!' the boys then made crying sounds to mock me.

I bit my lip, I wanted to swear at them, cuss them out, and beat the living daylights out of them. But what could I do, I was a geek with no friends, no strength, me fighting 3 people, will 100% end with me to the trip to the hospital. One of the boys, forced me up, by grabbing a tuft of my hair. 'Lets take him to the haunted mansion down the street!' Connor said, smiling widely. 'Like what we did with Jorge!' the boys, nodded in agreement. I looked at them in horror, I wouldn't mind going anywhere, but there. That mansion, which is down the street, is just strange. Whenever I pass it, despite it being abandoned, unkept, with its smashed windows, vandalized walls, I can't help but fill tempted to go inside, despite my subconsciousness, telling me that setting foot in that mansion would have consequences. Better way to describe it, is the demonic snake tempting Eve, to eat from the forbidden fruit.

Despite my protests, the boys dragged me along the street, all the way to the forbidden mansion. When we reached the front of the mansion, I couldn't bare to look at it. 'You have to go inside, and tomorrow, if you survive, you have to take something and show it to us' Connor explained, smiling sadistically. 'Just like Jorge, he probably wont come out alive' Trevon said, laughing whilst he spoke.  'Well if he dies, we could always find another 'Brandon' ' Chris added, clasping his hands together, smiling evilly. These boys, weren't normal, they were pure evil, with no human sympathy. They forcibly dragged me up the stairs, Chris pushed opened the mansion door, and I was forcibly pushed inside.

The door slammed shut behind me, and as I was on my knees, I heard the boys laugh. I was in a hallway, and the marble was caked with dust. The wallpaper was dusty from age, and peeled. In front of me was a flight of stairs, but I was going to first explore, the 1st floor. I shakily, got my phone from my pocket, and began to record. The first room I went to was the living room, it was spacious, and quite empty, having just two brown couches which had a moth eaten blanked draped over it. The window, was smashed, big enough for me to squeeze through and escape, but for some I reason I felt tempted to continue to explore.

I then went to the kitchen, the walls were peeled as well, and it looked aged. I looked through the cabinets, and at the back of one of the cabinet, was a strange, golden, bracelet, which had a pendant attached to it. I admired the bracelet, and put it around my wrist, wondering why something so beautiful could be in a place like this. Despite feeling the urge to continue exploring the mansion, I felt a sensation of being watched, like I wasnt alone. I ran out of the kitchen, and as I was about to open the door, a soft melody, echoed throughout the house. I dont know what came over me, but the tempting sensation to explore was to strong, I felt legs walk by myself, and follow the voice mindlessly upstairs.

I was in another hallway, and at the end of the hallway, a wooden door creaked slowly open. My mind screamed in agony, begging me to run back and never return, but my body which was no longer mine, followed the singing of the siren mindlessly. The room, was much different from the others downstairs. It looked extravagant, the walls were painted black, with white tiny bats, and there was two victorian style loveseats, and a furnace in front of it. In the corner of the room, was a full length, dressing mirror, which rested against the wall. Strangely, as I approached the mirror, I could see that there was no reflection of me or the room coming from the mirror, it was just red. A glowing red, which light seeped from the mirror. It felt boiling hot, standing in front of the mirror, and the smell of smoke filled my nostrils. 

I took a step back, weirded out. 

'Hey there!' A voice bellowed, I landed on my but, in shock. Three figures, crept out of the black abyss of the mirror, with a look of glee on their faces. They looked human, but not quite. Red skinned, bald, and with horns on either side of their head, eyes that resembled those of a cat with slit pupils. They were all identical in appearance so I couldn't tell them apart, two of them accept for one, wore the same bracelet that i had on my wrist. They looked like the stereotypical potrayal of demons, you'd see in the media. 'Fresh Blood!' one of them said, staring into my soul, with piercing eyes, black liquid seeping from their mouth. 'What are the odds', one of them said, pointing at me. 'We'd just drained the life out of our other blood slave, and were going to come out and find another. But our prey is right here' 

One of the demons, grabbed my arm which had the bracelet on it, I yelped. 'Woah! Thats mine' it shrieked, in an angry tone. 'You took it from me. Thief' I stuttered, looking down at the floor. 'I-Im sorry' the demon smirked, and roughly grabbed the bracelet from my arm, and put it on its arm. 'This bracelet, helps us demons to look human' the demon said, triumphantly. I watched mouth agaped, as every each of them, began to transform into beautiful men and women, I could now tell them apart. 'Were related to sirens', the male one said. 'Jokes aside' the blonde woman said. 'Lets take this young boy, I reckon he'll last for a couple of months' 'No!' I shrieked, and stood up, without thinking the words escaped from my mouth. 'Th-there's three other boys, you can eat' I then took a deep breath, and continued. 'I could get them for you, tomorow' 

The three demons looked at eachother, then at me. 'Very well then. It'll save us the trouble of getting out into the human world, after all, that godamn foundation is after us' the blonde-haired woman said, with a look of disdain. 'You better not be lying kid, or we'll come after you and your family' the red haired lady said. 'I promise' I said, before taking my leave. 

I was dreading walking school the next day, not because of the daily bullying, but because I felt guilt of what I was about to do. I also felt glee, today, my suffering would end. I lied and told the boys, that I found a treasure chest, on the second floor, and that after school they should help me get it as it was very heavy. Being dumb idiots, they believed every word. 

Im plagued with the memory of this, the way they screamed, and clawed at the floor as they were forcibly dragged into the black abyss of the mirror. 'This supply would last us two years!' one of the demons said, with happiness. As I was about to leave the room, one of the demons said. 'Our supply would last much longer if we ke-' I ran out of the room, and bolted downstairs. Behind me, I  could hear them say. 'We'll see you again soon, Brandon!' 

Its been 10 years. Trevon, Chris, Connor, are long dead. Their case was widespread on the media, but soon died down, as soon as I turned 19 I moved to New York. Their deaths, plague me, but what plagues me more, is the last thing those demons  said. Every time, I walk on the street, I wonder to myself, anyone that walks on the street could fairly well be a demon in disguise. 

One day, I was in the shopping centre, and two young women and one man, pointing at me, laughing amongst themselves. I heard snippets of their conversation. "We went to many countries to look for him, turns out he was still in America all along. We are so stupid!" 

They've found me.
