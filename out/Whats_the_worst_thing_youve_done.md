Upon answering this question, many people would say the worst thing that they've ever done in their life, was nicking a candy bar from the shop. Or, using their parents bank card to go on a shopping spree when they were a teen. But nothing could compare, to what I did when I was thirteen years old some ten years ago. Despite it being ten years ago, I still haven't gotten over it, it replays in my mind every day. I've been sent to asylums, because whenever I tell people what happened, they think I'm insane. But since in this app, people believe in all crazy stuff, ranging from ghosts and demons, I hope ya'll believe my every word.

Anyways. My name is Brandon Willis, and when I was thirteen years old, I moved with my mother all the way from Minnesota to Louisiana. This was all because, my mum had a nasty break up with my father, and he threatened to gun us down then kill himself. So, my mum called the police on him, and whilst he was in jail, we moved states away, so that he won't try anything when he gets back from jail. No wonder why I was such a timid kid, who would be blame me for a childhood like that. 'Will we ever see dad again?' I asked mum, whilst we were on the plane. I was sitting on the seat by the window, almost too the brink of tears. My mum shook her head, 'he isn't well, Brandon. It's for our wellbeing that we distance ourselves from him' with that, she returned to her book, and didn't utter another word during the whole plane ride. The plane had to stop a couple of times, to refuel itself, and I didn't get much sleep on the plane, the seat was too uncomfortable.

When we finally got to Louisiana, New Orleans, we were met at the airport by my aunt, Leah, with open arms . We were to live at her apartment, until mum had enough money to afford a house. Unfortunately, her apartment had only one bedroom so me and my mum had to sleep on the sofa which was a pain in the ass. Week later, I was enrolled in the Local Highschool, Riverbane high. I had to mentally prepare myself, before I went onto that yellow school bus. 'You'd be fine Brandon' mum reassured before I left the house. 'I hope you make friends' when I went to the bus, it was crowded with loads of kids, chatting amongst themselves, and I had no idea were to sit. I evantually found a empty seat at the back, which was next to the window.

I was fumbling with my hands nervously, going to a new school is utterly terrifying. I seemed to catch the attention of the two boys sitting in front of me, they looked back at me. 'Ayo! whos that?' one of the boys a dark skinned boy, who wore a red cap said. 'A newbie' the other boy said, who had blonde hair and wore shades. 'H-hi' I stammered, feeling intimidated. 'I'm Brandon what's your names?' 'Im Trevon' the red cap boy said, and then gestured to his blonde friend next to him. 'This is Connor' I nodded and smiled relieved that I got to know some people from that school. 'Yo look at his glasses' a boy with dark brown hair said, who was sitting on the opposite side. 'Looks like mans gonna be the new Jorge!'

'Jorge?' I asked, eyebrows raised in confusion. 'Jorge is some nerd that disappeared like 3 months ago' Trevon said, he then pointed at me and grinned. 'And since he's gone, we've got our eyes on you!' Boy, did they keep their word they made my school life hell for absolutely no reason. Every day, they would torment me. Humiliating me on the school bus by putting gum in my hair or tripping me over, locking me into lockers and leaving me there for the whole school period, chatting shit and creating fights against me and other people. All this, because I wore glasses, was the new kid, and their 'toy' vanished like 3 months ago. Trevon, Connor, and that dark haired boy who I evantually learnt who's name was Chris, made my life a living hell.

None of the teachers seemed to care and didn't help me at all, despite my mum storming to the school several times, demanding these boys be punished. The teachers simply said, 'Brandon just got to man up'. My mum had enough and was going to enrol me into another local high school, but it would take ages for me to enroll so I had to deal with Trevon and his terrible gang. Whenever I pass the pole, were Jorge Barr's missing poster is taped on, I always wonder to myself. 'Could it be that Trevon, Chris, Connor were involved in his dissapearance?'. I knew I had to get away from that school, before something terrible happens to me.

After school, I didnt bother taking the school buss as I didn't want to deal with the terrible gangs torments. As I was walking, something hard slammed across my head. Those three brutes had stalked me, without me even noticing. 'ARGH!' I shrieked, and fell down on my knees, putting a hand to the back of my head. The object that hit me, was a trainer, and to my horror I realized it was Trevons trainer. 'Yo!' Connor shrieked, and grabbed me by the collar. 'Get your ass up, geek!' I timidly, stood up, wobbling a bit. In front of me, was the terrible gang, with smug looks on their faces. 'Give me my trainer, loser!' Trevon said, smirking with that evil grin of his. I clenched my fist, and bent down to grab his trainer by the shoelace, as I bent down, one of the boys kicked my but. I fell down face down, tears streaming from my eyelids. 'Ah! You gonna cry!' Chris said, and the boys laughed amongst themselves. 'He's such a little girl, crying like that. WAWA!' the boys then made crying sounds to mock me.

I bit my lip, I wanted to swear at them, cuss them out, and beat the living daylights out of them. But what could I do, I was a geek with no friends, had no strength, me fighting 3 people will 100% end with me to the trip to the hospital. One of the boys, forced me up, by grabbing a tuft of my hair. 'Lets take him to the haunted mansion down the street!' Connor said, smiling widely. 'Like what we did with Jorge!' the boys, nodded in agreement. I looked at them in horror, I wouldn't mind going anywhere, but there. That mansion, which is down the street, is just strange. Whenever I pass it, despite it being abandoned, unkept, with its smashed windows, vandalized walls, I can't help but feel tempted to go inside, despite my subconsciousness, telling me that setting foot in that mansion would have consequences. Better way to describe it, is the demonic snake tempting Eve, to eat from the forbidden fruit.

Despite my protests, the boys dragged me along the street, all the way to the forbidden mansion. When we reached the front of the mansion, I couldn't bare to look at it. 'You have to go inside, and tomorrow, if you survive, you have to record the house and take something and show it to us' Connor explained, smiling sadistically. 'Just like Jorge, he probably wont come out alive' Trevon said, laughing whilst he spoke.  'Well if he dies, we could always find another 'Brandon' ' Chris added, clasping his hands together, smiling evilly. These boys, weren't normal, they were pure evil, with no human sympathy. They forcibly dragged me up the stairs, Chris pushed opened the mansion door, and I was forcibly pushed inside.

The door slammed shut behind me, and as I was on my knees, I heard the boys cackle amongst themselves. I was in a hallway, and the wooden floor was caked with dust. The wallpaper was dusty from age, and was peeling. In front of me was a flight of stairs, but I was going to first explore, the 1st floor. I shakily, got my phone from my pocket, and began to record. The first room I went to was the living room, it was spacious, and quite empty, having just two brown couches which had a moth eaten blanket draped over it. The window, was smashed, big enough for me to squeeze through and escape, but for some I reason I felt tempted to continue to explore.

I then went to the kitchen, the walls were peeled as well, and everything looked aged. I looked through the dusty cabinets, and at the back of one of the cabinet, was a strange, golden, bracelet, which had a glistening pendant attached to it. I admired the bracelet, and put it around my wrist, wondering why something so beautiful could be in a place like this. I suddenly felt a sensation of being watched, like I wasnt alone. I ran out of the kitchen, and as I was about to enter the lounge to crawl out the broken window to escape, a soft melody echoed throughout the house. I dont know what came over me, but I felt tempted to follow the alluring melody. The melodic melody engulfed my thoughts, and the only thing I could think of, was to follow that beautiful song.

In a trance I walked upstairs to the beautiful sound, my mind was in conflict. My subconcious mind was begging me not to follow the melody, but it was muffled by the temptation to follow. At the end of the hallway, was a door that slowly creaked open by itself. I entered the room in a bewitched state, the room was much different from the other rooms downstairs. It looked extravagant, the walls were painted black with white tiny bats flying, and there was two red victorian style loveseats and a lit furnace in front of it. In the corner of the room, was a full length dressing mirror, which rested against the wall. I snapped out of the trance, as soon as the melody abruptly stopped. I looked around my surroundings, confused to why I followed that strange melody mindlessly. The mirror caught my attention, as I approached it, I noticed that it wasn't  reflecting me or the room. The mirror was pitch black, and black wispery smoke was emanating from the black abyss, flooding my nose. 

I took a step back, weirded out. 

'Hey there!' A deep voice bellowed, I fell backwards in shock and landed on my but. Suddenly, three creatures crept out of the black abyss of the mirror, with a look of glee on their faces. They looked human, but not quite. Red skinned, bald, and with horns on either side of their head, eyes that resembled those of a cat with slit pupils. They were all identical in appearance so I couldn't tell them apart, two of them accept for one, wore the same bracelet that I had on my wrist. They looked like the stereotypical potrayal of demons, you'd see in the media. 'Fresh Blood!' one of them said, staring into my soul, with piercing eyes, they licked their lips with a forked tongue. 'What are the odds', one of them said, pointing at me, their elonagted and sharp nails almost touched my face. 'We'd just drained the life out of our other blood slave, and were going to come out and find another. But our prey is right here!' 

One of the demons, grabbed my arm which had the bracelet on it, their sharp nails touched my skin threatening to dig in. 'Woah! Thats mine' it shrieked, in an angry tone. 'You took it from me. Thief' I looked down at the floor avoiding the monsters, and I managed to whisper despite my fear. 'I-Im sorry' the demon smirked, and roughly pulled the bracelet from my arm, scraping my arm a bit with its long fingernails which drew a bit of blood. 'This bracelet, helps us demons to look human' the demon said, triumphantly. I watched mouth agaped, as every each of them, began to transform into beautiful men and women, I could now tell them apart. 'Were related to sirens', the male one jokingly said. 'Jokes aside' the beautiful blonde woman said. 'Lets take this boy, his blood smells so good, I cant wait to dig my fangs in!' 'No!' I shrieked, and stood up, without thinking the words escaped from my mouth. 'Th-there's three other boys, you can eat' I then took a deep breath, and continued. 'I could get them for you, tomorow' 

The three demons looked at eachother as if requesting for the others approval, then after reaching a agreement they looked at me. 'Very well then. It'll save us the trouble of getting out into the human world after we drain you, after all, that godamn foundation is after us' the blonde-haired woman said, with a look of disdain. 'You better not be lying kid, or we'll come after you and your family' the red haired lady said. 'I promise' I said, and then I ran out of the room as fast as I can. I could hear their cackles behind me.

I was dreading walking school the next day, not because of the daily bullying, but because I felt guilt of what I was about to do. I also felt tinge of happiness, today, my suffering would end. I lied and told the boys, that I found a treasure chest on the second floor, and that after school they should help me get it as it was very heavy. Being dumb idiots, they believed every word. 

Im plagued with the memory of this, the way they screamed, and clawed at the floor as they were forcibly dragged into the black abyss of the mirror. 'This supply would last us a year!' one of the demons said, with happiness. As I was about to leave the room, one of the demons said. 'Our supply would last much longer if we also take that b-"' I ran out of the room, and bolted downstairs, sweat was streaming down my face. Behind me, I  could hear them say. 'We'll see you again very soon Brandon!'

Its been 10 years. Trevon, Chris, Connor, are long dead. Their case was widespread on the media, but soon died down as the years went on, as soon as I graduated highschool I immediatly moved to New York. Their deaths, plague me, but what plagues me more is the last thing those demons  said. Every time, I walk on the street, I wonder to myself anyone that walks on the street could fairly well be a demon in disguise. 

One day. I was in the shopping centre, and I saw a group of people who kept on glancing back at me. One man, two women. I could've sworn I heard one of them say. 'Can't believe we went all over the world for this boy, and he was in America the whole time. Now we can finally savour the sweetness of his blood!' 

They've found me.
