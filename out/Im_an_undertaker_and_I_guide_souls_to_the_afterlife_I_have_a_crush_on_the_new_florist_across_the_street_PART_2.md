Hey Nosleep! I know it’s been about a week since I told you all about my crush, and I'm super sorry- things have been so busy at work. I think I’ve made some progress since [then](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18zosyi/im_an_undertaker_and_i_guide_souls_to_the/)!

Well, it’s not good progress, but it’s still something, right?

Irina opened up her store a couple of days after the fateful night in the cemetery. I went over with a freshly-baked pie to celebrate the opening, but she barely looked at it, said “I hate blueberry”, and then went in the back to do inventory. I should have known that blueberry is not everyone’s cup of tea, even though my grandma’s recipe was always a crowd pleaser.

I visited her store a few times to see how her business was doing- and to my pleasant surprise, it was doing well! Even though she refused to sell me any flowers, she was really nice to her other customers. She gave a lot of flowers away for free, which probably wasn’t the best for business- but what do I know, I’m no expert on managing a store.

I’ve also asked her a few times if she wanted to grab lunch or dinner with me, and each time, I was met with a solid “no”. I figured the first couple of times she was busy with work, but then it started becoming a pattern- and eventually I took the hint. I didn't really know what I had done wrong, so I considered myself lucky that my friends Wes and Piper visit me from time to time. They ended up giving me really good advice!

“Dude, you’re coming off way too strong. Like, kind of creepy if I’m being honest.”

Well, it’s tough love. But friends are meant to be there to encourage you to be the best version of yourself, right?

“You think it’s too much that I visit her every day?” I sighed. “I mean, I've stopped, but-”

“Yes!” Piper rolled her eyes. “First of all, she's probably super busy trying to run her shop, she only opened a few days ago. And you should have gotten the hint when she rejected your pie.”

“Maybe if it wasn’t blueberry, she would have liked it?”

“No, dude, she just doesn’t like you.” Wes patted my shoulder as he bit into his slice. “’Cause this pie is really good. The fact that she rejected it means she wants nothing to do with you.”

“I don’t want to be a bother,” I frowned. “I just wanted to start off as friends. I know she’s way out of my league.”

“But friendship’s a two-way street.” Wes pointed out. “If she doesn’t want you around, you kinda have to accept that.”

“Look, I get it. You haven’t gotten to interact with anyone new in a while.” Piper chimed. “But when a girl isn’t into you, you need to learn to call it quits before you get called an incel.”

“Honestly, I think you’re lucky she hasn’t killed you,” Wes chuckled. “Grims are scary things.”

Apparently I had fallen asleep during the part of our training when they went over entities to be wary of; I wasn't the best student, to be fair. Piper had to explain to me that Grims essentially did the opposite of what we do- instead of guiding souls to the afterlife, they completely eradicate souls before they can pass onto the afterlife for reincarnation. Grims usually step in when a soul is deemed to be utterly irredeemable- such as souls of serial murderers, rapists, and whatnot. Like Irina had mentioned, these souls are deemed too dangerous to reincarnate. Because Grims are under a completely different jurisdiction from us Undertakers, our paths don’t cross too much; normally there is very little overlap between the kinds of souls we deal with. But when they do overlap, Grims get priority- and it can get a little messy from there.

“Yeah, I had to deal with a Grim when one of my clients died.” Wes recalled. “I mean, the client was on Epstein’s list, so it was kind of a no-brainer- but man, they can be so rude.”

“Seriously. They think they’re better than us because they get priority. And they’re always late.”

“For real, tell me how I was almost done with my paperwork and about to send the soul off when the Grim just barged into my office.” Wes crossed his arm. “If you’re gonna eradicate my client, at least get there before I’ve already filled out 90 pages of documents.”

“Most of the time they’re cranky, crusty old men. They probably don’t even know how to use modern technology.” Piper shrugged.

“Irina’s not a cranky, crusty old man,” I sighed. “She probably knows how to use modern technology.”

“Get it together!” Piper snapped her fingers in front of my eyes. “Remember, she’s the enemy by default. The reason she doesn't want anything to do with you- you know, beyond the pushiness- is probably because of your job.”

“But I swear,” I retorted. “She’s not a bad person. I mean, just the other day, I was sweeping the grounds and I saw a little girl just standing outside, staring at the flowers. And I didn’t want to eavesdrop, but she couldn’t afford flowers for her grandfather’s funeral, so Irina gave her one for free. Would a bad person do that?”

Piper and Wes glanced at each other with a defeated look in their eyes.

“Kind of sounds like bad business practice.” Piper said.

“That’s what I thought too,” I shrugged. “But who am I to judge?”

“Either way, she has made it very obvious she doesn’t want you around, so stop visiting her before you get a restraining order filed against you.” Wes said.

“‘If you can’t physically be here, you won’t be able to work here anymore. And I heard there’s not gonna be any new openings anywhere for a while- unless you wanna work in a crematorium, and I don’t think you do.” Piper warned. Crematoriums were the worst- they're so boring.

“Absolutely not.”

Wes and Piper always gave me such good advice. Even though they were leagues beyond me in terms of the job hierarchy, they never made me feel less than them like many other Undertakers tended to do. Unfortunately, because our jobs are so demanding, they could never stay too long- but I always appreciated their perspective. And they always appreciated my food. I also didn’t realize how strong I was coming off, and I didn’t want to overstep any more boundaries than I already had, so I took their words to heart and stopped visiting Irina at her store.

But that didn’t mean I couldn’t sneak a few peeks at her store as I swept the grounds. For such a remote location, Irina sure seemed to be having a lot of visitors. People walked in and out of her store with various different arrangements, all of them so vibrant and beautiful. Irina also occasionally stepped out with her customers, personally sending them on their way. Sometimes our eyes met and I’d look away quickly, only for her to march back into her store. She had a natural charm, and she seemed to be a magnetic force, pulling people into her store that I had never seen before. Who wouldn’t want to pay her a visit? With everyone but me, she was incredibly charming and personable.

It really sucks when your crush doesn’t want anything to do with you, but hey- that’s life, right? And Wes and Piper were right- Grims and Undertakers ultimately don’t mix well. It probably had less to do with me and more with the fact that she didn’t want any workplace drama, which is totally understandable.

That’s what I kept telling myself as I tended to the grounds. Ever since Irina broke into the cemetery, I had to tighten up security a bit. I installed new locks and chains on the mausoleum and the entrance to the cemetery itself, after spending the last few days mending the fences that Irina broke down.

As I tinkered with the chains on the mausoleum that I somehow managed to get all tangled up, a familiar voice snapped me out of my concentration.

“You seriously think a bunch of chains are gonna stop me if I really wanted to get back in there?”

I whipped around, bumping my head in the doorway in the process.

“I-Irina,” I stuttered. “Hi! I, uh, I didn’t know you were there.”

Irina looked around, arms folded across her chest. “You do take good care of this place, I’ll give you that. It’s really clean.”

I fidgeted with my wrench. “Thanks, I try my best.”

She paused. “You haven’t dropped by in a while.”

“Well, I-“ I coughed, caught off guard. “I didn’t think you wanted me around.”

“I don’t,” she said matter-of-factedly. She also seemed a bit distracted, looking around the premises. “Are you free tonight?”

My heart must have skipped a few beats there. “T-tonight? Like, today?”

“Mhm.”

“Yes! I'm always free. I never have any plans, like, ever.” I said.

“Good. Meet me at the entrance to the woods at 9,” Irina nodded. “We’re going hunting.”

“Huh?”

\*

For the record, I didn’t know what Irina was talking about- I was just happy to be included. But I definitely didn’t know what to expect.

The woods are spooky at night. I know, it’s weird coming from a guy who literally hangs out with the dead and works at a cemetery. But the woods just give me the heebie jeebies, especially when your only source of light is an oil-run lamp. The only sounds that should be heard are your own footsteps, yet the sounds of wild animals and wind passing through the trees made it so much scarier. So many things have happened in remote areas, and to be honest, the living can be so much scarier than the dead.

These woods in particular have a bit of a nasty history. For a while, it was used as a general dumping ground for victims of the cartels and gangs that operated in the area. Law enforcement frequently ran into dismembered body parts and cadavers in these woods, often so disfigured that they were impossible to identify. That aspect had slowed down quite a bit in recent years, but regardless- it’s not the most pleasant place to be.

I got to the entrance a little earlier than 9- well, to be exact, I got there at 8. And maybe a whole hour before was overkill, considering Irina got there thirty minutes later than planned. But she seemed like she was on a mission, barely acknowledging me besides having me follow her to a deep part of the woods.

These woods were lined with weeping willows on either side, which added to the generally creepy atmosphere. A deep haze had settled throughout the forest, making visibility even worse than it usually would have been in the dark. But Irina was so brave- I was so easily startled by the occasional owl hoot and any leaf crunching that didn’t belong to our own footsteps, but she seemed to be so unbothered. I was also impressed at how well she seemed to navigate these woods, because she was taking us way off the beaten path. It was also quite reassuring that she had a giant scythe with her. And hey, I was just glad to be along for the ride.

That is, until I realized what she wanted from me.

“You want me to do what?”

Irina stared at me. “I thought I was pretty clear.”

“I don’t know, it just-“ I shook my head. “It sounds like you want me to be *bait*?”

It turned out that Irina wanted me there for one reason, and one reason only- to help draw out a certain wandering soul she needed to eradicate. This particular soul was on her hitlist for having been responsible for having personally killed her father, then taking his watch as a reward for himself. She had been on the search for a long time; it was hard to find someone who didn’t have a proper grave, but she’d eventually figured out that he had betrayed the head honcho at some point and met his fate accordingly.

Wandering souls are not as rare as one might think. Sometimes, souls don’t want to move on. Even with the help of an Undertaker, there are always souls that simply are not ready to proceed with the next steps. And even though we try our best to keep track of everyone, there are always souls that slip through the cracks, because they are in denial that they’re actually dead. As enough time passes, these souls grow resentful of what their lives could have been if they had stayed alive- and the resentment causes them to morph into something unrecognizable and inhuman.

I’ve personally never come across these souls, but I’ve heard some horror stories from those who have. These souls feel strong hatred towards the living for having the lifespan that they never did, and they have been known to act irrationally and lash out at Undertakers who just want to help them move on. In fact, it usually takes a few Undertakers to even get one of these under control. An area like this, with a rich history of being the final resting place for unwilling victims, was a rich breeding ground for resentful wandering souls.

“Yeah, that’s actually exactly what I want you to do.” she shrugged.

“This doesn’t sound safe,” I pointed out. “Are you sure I’m not gonna, y’know, be hurt in the process?”

“No guarantees.”

“Can I…maybe, you know, not do this?”

Irina stared blankly at me. “I mean, you could leave, but do you know how to get back home?”

“…No.” Unfortunately for me, I had a really bad sense of direction in general- and with all the twists and turns Irina took us through, I definitely would have ended up lost in the woods.

“So, you really don’t have a choice, do you?”

“Also no.” I hung my head.

“Alright, let’s go over the plan again, then. You’re gonna head over to that opening over there,” She pointed at a small gap between a cluster of willow trees. “And you’re gonna draw out the soul that’s been hiding there.”

“Are we absolutely sure there’s someone there?” I found myself nibbling my fingernails in anxiety.

“Yeah, I’ve been searching for a long time.” Irina stared into the opening. “I wouldn’t have brought you along if I wasn’t so certain.”

“If you’re going to eradicate it, why not just go in yourself?”

“Because the moment it feels my presence, it’s going to try to run away.” Irina explained. “These things don’t like the feeling of Grims, they know they’ve done something wrong. We have to catch it off guard.”

“Okay,” I said. “And what if this lovely individual attacks me?”

“Run to me.” Irina waved her scythe around. “I’ll take care of the rest.”

“But what if it’s already felt your presence, and it’s already left the area? Or what if it retaliates against me, because it knows I’m affiliated with you?”

“You ask way too many questions,” Irina sighed, visibly annoyed. “What are you so scared of? You literally deal with the dead for a living.”

“But the dead can’t ambush me,” I pointed out. “They can’t just pop up and shoot me in the head in the forest and leave me for dead.”

“Eh, you’d be surprised.”

“Either way, I don’t know if I can do this. I never agreed to-“ I gestured wildly. “*This*.”

“I thought we were on the same page.”

“What on Earth made you think that?” I said, exasperated. “I mean, we’ve barely interacted beyond when you broke into my cemetery; every time I came around, you ignored me, and you didn’t even want me around your store.”

“Yeah, but you kept coming back.” Irina replied evenly, kicking a pebble to the side. “Despite everything.”

I guess I had nothing to say to that.

\*

Maybe Piper had a point- maybe I fell too hard too quickly, because the fact that I was doing this for someone I hadn’t even known for a week was kind of insane. These souls were unpredictable, and I didn’t do well with unpredictable entities. But Irina was right- despite everything, I kept coming back for a reason- I wanted to get to know her better, for her to be my friend, and if this was a way into her life, then it was just a sacrifice I had to make.

The willow trees parted into a surprisingly large clearing, with the full moon reflecting on the clear lake that stretched for miles beyond my view. I had no idea this lake even existed, and under different circumstances, this would have been a wonderful find. But in the darkness of the night with only my oil lamp to guide me, the lake was more eerie than anything. It didn’t help that a deep fog had settled over the lake, giving it a Sleepy Hollow-esque vibe that certainly didn’t make it any more welcoming.

It was at this moment I realized I had no idea what I was looking for, or how I was supposed to draw “it” out. All Irina told me was to make a commotion to bring out the soul she was looking for. But I didn’t even know what this soul looked like.

“Hello?” I called, my voice echoing across the empty lake. No response.

“Hellooo?” I tried again. Again, nothing. It seemed more and more likely that I was going to end up letting Irina down. I began to question whether I should head back when I noticed the surface of the lake beginning to ripple, bubbles forming in the distance.

From the middle of the lake emerged what looked to be a large, moss-like entity. It was vaguely shaped like a human, except with moss and other water plants layered on top of it like paper-mache. This had to have been what Irina was looking for. The creature began trudging towards me, groaning in the process. I felt myself gulping instinctively, backing up away from the lake, reminding myself that I just had to let it get close enough for me to start guiding it towards the opening.

As it got closer, I realized this was not just one soul, but three wandering souls that seemed to have mixed into one. Some of the plant life parted and fell off in clumps to reveal the discombobulated faces of three separate entities, all with horrifying expressions. All three faces seemed to be frozen in a state of shock and fear, with two of the faces’ skins melting off their skulls. Along with the wet sounds of its feet, the souls groaned with every step, as if it was painful to plod forward. It certainly did not make for a pretty picture.

But more than that, I felt…bad. I knew that the soul Irina was looking for did very bad things in his lifetime, but it still made me feel bad to see what became of him and these other two random souls. These souls must have been wandering for so long that they found each other and absorbed one another to create this monstrous entity. Maybe this was the only sense of comfort it had.

“*Hello? Hellooo?*” It repeated back in what sounded vaguely like my voice, garbled with lakewater. The more it revealed itself, the more the plants began to fall off its body, revealing what I could only describe as an abomination. With three legs connected to a single torso, and five arms sticking out haphazardly all around it, the faces began to shriek as it walked faster and faster towards the surface of the lake. It looked to have barely any humanity left in it, from what I could only assume came from years of wandering.

“Oh God,” I muttered under my breath. I felt a strange pang of sadness. Anyone at any point could become unlucky enough to have missed their chance at the afterlife- it really was a matter of right place, right time, and not everyone was fortunate enough to be guaranteed a final resting spot. And it wasn’t their fault either; oftentimes, I found that people with the hardest lives while living tended to have the hardest time moving on, for reasons beyond their control. It just seemed so unfair.

But fear overtook my feelings of pity pretty quickly. The creature swiped at me, and I stumbled backwards. It didn’t seem happy to see me, and it was probably time to run- but in all the panic, I tripped over my feet and fell face-first into the dirt.

Now, I didn’t know what happened to Undertakers who were attacked by wandering souls. In fact, I had never heard of any getting physically harmed by these souls, but when three shrieking faces descended upon you with terrifying expressions, you probably also wouldn’t think of much else besides bracing for impact. I didn’t suppose it wanted to talk; I wasn’t even sure it was capable of reasoning, much less communication. I threw my arms in front of my face, curling into myself and shutting my eyes- for some reason, my brain decided to wonder at that moment whether or not I had turned the oven off at home.

As I felt the water drip from the entity in front of me, the shrieking stopped, replaced with a pained groan. I opened my eye slightly to see Irina’s scythe buried in the forehead of the head in the middle. The soul seemed just as shocked as I was, pausing a moment before registering what had just happened. It began screaming in pain, wobbling around in front of me before all three of its legs folded at their knees, falling over to the floor. I whipped my head to see Irina walking towards us, an unreadable expression on her face; she had thrown the scythe all the way from where she was standing with remarkable precision.

She crossed the distance quickly and stopped right in front of the creature, tilting her head to the side as if to examine it closely. She grabbed the handle of her scythe, swiftly yet calmly pulling it out of the face. In the place of what would normally be a wound was a row of small, black roses blooming where the cut would have been.

Irina looked behind at me briefly. “You okay?”

I nodded, overwhelmed by the situation. Even in my shock, I couldn’t help but feel even worse for the creature, which had now folded into itself as it retreated backwards in vain. It was clearly not in its right mind, confused by what had happened.

“Kind of funny that this is how you ended up, huh?” I couldn’t see her face, but Irina seemed too collected for someone who was face-to-face with something out of a Lovecraftian horror novel. “I think you have something that belongs to me.”

Without warning, Irina grabbed one of the arms sticking out of the graying torso and ripped it out of its socket, a horrifying scream following the sickening crunch of bone. The other two souls seemed to be in pain as well, wailing as if they had all lost a limb simultaneously. She gave the arm a cursory glance before trailing her eyes over to the wrist, which boasted an impressive watch. She grabbed the watch, yanked it over the wrist, then casted the disjointed arm carelessly to the side. As the arm hit the floor, the creature itself began to melt onto the floor in a puddle of what seemed to be like mud and debris, until all that was left was the three decapitated heads of the souls that had fused together. The wound on the face of the middle soul began to produce more roses at an alarming rate, until eventually the soul itself was no longer visible, with a bouquet of black roses taking its place. The other two souls were left groaning on the floor.

“That didn’t take as long as I thought it would.” Irina remarked. Then, turning towards me with her hands clasped behind her, “Time to go home?”

“Not yet,” I muttered, wringing my hands nervously. “Could you wait here for a moment?”

Irina didn't say anything as I knelt by the remaining souls, but she didn’t leave either. From the moment I saw the creature, I was filled with a deep sadness and pity for the souls, who had most likely fused together because they had been wandering for so long. Even in death, souls looked to each other for comfort and companionship; they were lonely. I’ve never dealt with a situation like this before, but every day was a learning experience on this job, and this was no different.

“We can’t just leave the other two.” I said.

“Well,” Irina hummed. “I only needed the one in the middle. I don’t really know what to do with those two, they’re not really under my jurisdiction.”

“No, it’s not your responsibility.” I shook my head. “This is my job now.”

Even though the soul Irina had eradicated had done some pretty horrible things in life, the other two weren’t on her list- it was more likely than not that they were victims in their own right, not found in time and forced to meander the area in death for what probably seemed like eternity. And I took my job very seriously; I had to help.

“I’m sorry that you didn’t have anyone to guide you before,” I said as the faces lay on their sides in anguish. “I have no idea what you’ve been through, but I can help you now.”

\*

Well, Nosleep, the bad news is- I have a lot more paperwork now than I anticipated for this week, and I’m scheduled for a visit from upstairs regarding the two souls. But that’s okay, because the good news is, Irina seems less annoyed by my general presence. I’m still maintaining a respectable distance, but she doesn’t just completely snub me anymore when I wave at her through the window. I think that’s good enough progress for now, and I’m hoping there’s more to come!
