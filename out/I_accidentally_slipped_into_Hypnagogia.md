Did you ever have those nights as a child where, no matter how many times you closed your eyes and slipped away into the alternate reality of dreaming, you never made any progress through the night? Hours spent unconscious and upon waking up only to realize almost no time has passed at all. You repeat the process of falling asleep, dreaming, and waking up so many times you have to wonder if you're still even on Earth at all. But eventually you fall asleep, wake up, and it’s morning. The sun releases you from the chains of night. You know that you were just having a rough night of sleep. Eventually the sun will come up. You know this.

I am twenty years old, and I know this. But let’s pretend, for hypothesis sake, that my night had gone on for longer than it should’ve. That I had fallen asleep, dreamt, and woken back up enough times that days should’ve passed. But as I look at my devices, they all give me the answer that it had only been one night. What would one do? 

Maybe I was just sleep-deprived from not being able to experience a full REM cycle the previous days. Maybe it’s the side effects of the heavy-duty nighttime cold medicine I tried to knock the cold finally out of my system. Or maybe, maybe, I for a period of time was stuck in an alternate reality.

Hear me out for a second. I know how this sounds. Do you think I want to play into this idea? I am a college student and previous high school AP and honors student. Do you think I’d ever want to consider something as batshit insane as this? I’m going to be a history teacher one day, for crying out loud. I am above believing in something as outlandish as this. Well, that was until last night.

In my shaken mental state, I do what any other person in this day and age does: I went to the internet to try and piece together a solution that feels alright. I came across this theory that I wasn’t able to find a ton of information on, but it provided the closest answer to what I was looking for.

It posits that when you go to sleep and dream, you enter into another universe. On occasion the journey of slipping between the realities lands you stuck in between. Sometimes it causes what we now call sleep paralysis, or if you’re extremely unlucky, if you’re me, you end up stuck in a plane that exists in-between. One I just call Hypnagogia, which means the state between being awake and asleep for simplicity's sake. I somehow ended up there and somehow was able to escape. I’m writing this here because I have to get it out somewhere. I refuse to jeopardize my future career over this.

Yesterday I barely survived a six-hour shift at my job. I’ve been sick the past few days, but money is tight, and I can’t skip a shift this week. I sucked it up and worked mostly in the back away from customers. There was a line to the door the moment I came in. I was prepping and running back and forth to help out my fellow coworkers for an hour straight. My manager was in, and she was cracking some jokes to me, to which I did not respond very politely. I was sick, exhausted, and mentally it had been a long week too. 

I just found out that my older sister is moving away within the next two weeks, and my mind is reeling from it. I felt abandoned entirely, not having any kind of heads-up until now. Of course it was always inevitable, but a warning would have been great. Being sick, tired, and having my personal life being a mess just did not mix well together.

I made it through my shift and was ready to greet sleep with open arms. Cranking the shower hot and setting it to mist, I enclosed myself in a makeshift sauna, trying to alleviate my symptoms. Wrapped up in warm clothes and with some food in my system, I dug through the medicine cabinet quickly, trying to take medicine before my temporary shower-induced relief wore off. 

My mom kissed the back of my head as I finally found the bottle of nighttime cold medicine. She said goodbye and had to go to work. My dad had left earlier in the day before I even went to work. It was just me and my older sister that night. I was polite enough to say hello to her when I came home but not much else. Every time I looked at her, the pain and vile words bubbled in my throat, so I clamped my jaw shut. I just needed time.

I was ensuring that I would sleep through the night; I wasn’t going to lie awake dying from illness, no, not tonight. I didn’t know that I wasn’t going to get the restful night’s sleep that I needed. I knock back the medicine, chasing it with water to take the taste from my mouth. 

I climbed into bed, letting my body sink into it, and stayed up trapped scrolling through my social media feed and texting. I had lain on my stomach and kicked my feet over the plans that this guy I’m talking to and I were going to have later this week. In another chat, my high school bestie and I were talking about how my sister broke my heart. She was dealing with her own challenges at home, and we went back and forth between focusing on me and focusing on her. 

The words in the messages had become harder and harder to read, so I reluctantly told him goodnight. I was supposed to see him tomorrow at school. We both hoped for a miracle that I would get over my cold by then; I was still going to see him regardless. I won’t be telling him about any of this; I am just writing this as fast as I can so I can go see him in an hour. I said goodnight to her as well. Our college lives had made it so hard to see each other. We promised it would be soon, but we don’t know when soon is.

My cat jumped on my bed and curled up next to me as I clicked through the multi-hour videos available to me. I was twenty years old, and there was nothing more comforting to me while sick than a Minecraft long play. Minecraft relaxing long play—Rainy Dark Forest—Cozy Witch’s Cabin (No Commentary) appealed to me then. With my perfect October-themed video to lull me to sleep, I set the sleep timer on the TV to shut off three hours from that moment. 

The Minecraft soundtrack was like a guiding hand towards dreamland. When I did eventually fall asleep, I had a vivid dream. I could remember the dream, partly. I was running away from something in an empty mall. My eyes had flown open, and I was breathing heavily. I didn’t know then that would be the first of many times I would wake up. It felt like I’d been asleep for the whole night. I looked at the clock, and it had only been two hours. My TV was still on; Minecraft was still there. 

Of course I thought nothing about that then. My first thoughts were of him; I texted him. I joked that I was going crazy because I slept for two hours, but it felt longer. Part of me wished he was still awake, just wanting to talk to him a little bit more. Despite my wishes, the time left on delivered ticked away. I readjusted the sleep timer on the TV and rolled back over, only listening to the sounds of an iron pickaxe mining away.

I felt myself slip off the propped pillow and woke up lying flat, staring at the ceiling. My chest felt tight, and I was wheezing. The air was warm and smothering. Straining, I pushed myself upright in an attempt to stop coughing. The light of my alarm clock caught my eye; the time was 2:04. 

I looked at the video on my TV; the outer shell of the cozy witch cabin was being completed. I grabbed the remote and rewound the video to about an hour in just so I could reset the sleep timer on the TV and have the video play well after I fell asleep. 

In the few moments that the TV made no noise, the quietness of the house felt so loud. The AC had turned off, and it made me shift in my bed. I sat for a few seconds before dragging my fan to the foot of my bed. As it whirled to life, the silence was successfully snuffed out. The air blowing against the beads of sweat made me start to cool down immediately. I turned back to the TV, accidentally rewinding it back to the beginning, but unbothered, I layed down. The tranquil sounds of Minecraft once again had returned me to a state of peace. 

Slowly, what little sound there was brought me to consciousness. The fan had turned off, though this time I wasn't dying from the heat. The Minecraft soundtrack was no longer; just blocks being mined away. Ever since childhood I thought it was so unnerving when you’d go mining just for the music to stop. It always disappeared subtly; you’d be playing for so long only to notice you hadn’t heard anything for a while. It made me shiver. 

I watched the video for only a few minutes before the lack of music within the cave got to me. I rewound the video towards the beginning again, where I knew there was enough sound to make me feel safe again. All this fear is over nothing. Too much fear for someone my age and knowing that someone else was in the house too. I watched a little while longer until the feeling of dread subsided and was overtaken by the need to use the restroom. 

Walking past my parents room, it looked like the light ended only a few feet away from the house. It made me pause for a moment. I approached the window. There was no light besides the red glow of Halloween lights. The light ended abruptly, and you couldn’t even see our pool. 

When I went to bed, the pool lights had been on. A voice somewhere deep in my mind asked if I was the only one left in the world. The feeling of dread grew quickly again, so I didn’t stand by the window long. How does someone feel isolated yet watched at the same time? I restructured my plan to find my cat, go to the restroom, and then go back to bed. 

My cat chirped sleepily as I picked him up and carried him to the restroom with me. I set him down for a moment only for him to jump into my lap to sit with me. When I came back to my room, he was locked tight in my arms. I only let him go to lie down without crushing him. I checked my phone in hopes that maybe he had woken up in the middle of the night and answered me, but he hadn’t yet. I knew he wouldn’t, but part of me was hopeful. 

I was the only person I knew that would wake up in the middle of the night consistently. Every night all my life. I would fall asleep early and then answer everyone else who stayed up late just after they went to sleep. In the morning they would question why I was up at that hour, but I just was, for no particular reason. I didn’t stay up till that hour, and I certainly didn’t stay awake much longer after the message was sent. There was never a night I was able to sleep through fully. I always wondered what that was like.

I left the video where it was and pushed back the TV timer once more. I thought about just leaving it where it was, but then the thought of it shutting off when I was still awake to notice bothered me. So now it was set to turn off at 6 AM, early morning. 

5:01 AM. A groan escaped my lips reading the time, the first noise that I made that night. I regretted it as soon as my mouth closed. I couldn’t fully fight off that feeling I had standing in my parents bedroom. It was like the noise from me rang out for miles. I listened for a few moments without knowing what I was listening for.

When I could be certain nothing was there, my eyes rolled back to the clock, irritation filling me again. I had to be up in an hour, and I felt wide awake. I just hoped I could’ve slept until my alarm or at least got closer to six than this. 

I had decided to stay up this time. I didn’t want to be groggy for class; that's just how my body worked. I had an easier time staying awake than letting myself fall asleep and getting up in a short amount of time. I laid my head on my pillow and watched the player slowly and methodically create the witch’s cabin.

After some time had passed, I realized I didn’t know how the video got to the point it was at. I thought about the video, trying to focus on specific parts, but nothing came to mind. It was like being taken to bed when you fall asleep on the couch. It was all a little fuzzy, and you were confused.

In the midst of my confusion, I noticed how dark it still was in my room. It shouldn't have been this dark. I looked over to my alarm clock, and the time read 1:05; that couldn’t have been right. I had already been up at this time. It was just 5 AM. I pulled my phone off the charger and looked at the time and just stared. 1:05. I turned my phone off and on a few times to see if it was glitched, but nothing changed. Even when I went to the clock app itself, it said my time zone’s time was 1:05, and other time zones were at their respective times, lining up with mine. 

I tried to justify it with a logical explanation at first, of course; you don’t jump to living in some kind of weird time loop or being stuck in an in-between universe without extreme reason. I reasoned that somehow I had been dreaming this whole time. That the past few times I woke up were a long, elaborate, and connected dream. I didn’t fully believe this, of course, because people don’t normally have dreams like that. But what other logical explanation did I have? I tried to check my messages with him just to see if I did text him. But despite me just being able to use my phone to check the time, my phone would now not unlock. I swiped up, and the screen would turn blank.

My investigation was cut short by my chest, which felt thick, and I had a bad coughing fit. Phlegm would catch with each breath I took and made the coughing worse. I didn’t want to wake my sister and went to the kitchen to refill my water. 

When I went to the kitchen, I stopped and stared out; the entire sliding glass door was fogged over. I remembered that in my “dream” out my parents bedroom windows, the light ended abruptly. But now there was condensation on the glass. My whole body felt feverish, mixed with hot and cold; I couldn't tell what the house really was. All I knew was that the sliding glass door was way too big for it to fog up like that. 

I didn’t move from where I was, my cough subsiding to give me the opportunity to stand in disbelief. I wondered if I was dreaming then too. I looked at my hands, all ten fingers. I pressed my finger to my palm; it didn’t go through it. I went to the calendar and read the dates, looked away, and looked back; nothing had changed. I was awake. I kept staring at the door while I refilled my water.

My cat rubbed his face against my legs. I was surprised I didn’t jump out of my skin. But I did jump a little. His claws tore into the tile, running back up the hall; the poor baby was probably scared out of his mind. I drank half the glass, waiting for my heart rate to slow back down. The door held me in a trance; the faint sounds of the clock in the living room ticking rang out, releasing me. 

Before I went back to my room to console myself and my cat, I took a few steps towards the sliding glass door. Making sure that this wasn’t an insanely thick fog but truly condensation. With my face inches from the glass, it was definitely condensation. As I began to stand back upright, out of the corner of my eye I thought I saw an indiscernible shape outside the glass. I jerked back. My heart rate is racing worse than before. Scanning the entire door, I didn’t see the shape again. It was my sign to go back to bed. 

Making a brisk stride down the hall, I was back in the comfort of my room with my Minecraft long play to fill the silence. I turned on my fan again before I crawled under my covers, and my cat jumped onto the bed, flopping against the side of my face. His purring was a reassuring presence, and I clung to that feeling as long as I could. My hands glided down the length of him, making him purr louder. I listened to the sounds of his purrs while I thought back about the “dreams.”

It made me remember when I was eight years old and my grandparents were visiting us from out of state. At the time I used to stay in my older sister’s room because I was scared at night. She had a bunk bed, and I stayed on the top bunk. I had gone to bed and felt as though I slept for a long amount of time, only to find out that I had slept for a few hours, similar to the night I’ve just experienced. 

That night, for a reason I still can’t figure out, I climbed down and walked out to the living room. When I went out to the living room, my family, including my grandparents, were all still awake. 

I didn’t say a word to any of them when I came out. I didn’t even have much of a thought in my mind. I walked out and crawled onto the couch and lay down. My family said words that fell on deaf ears. I woke up on the couch a few hours later at some time in the early AM. My head was clouded in confusion and the haze that made it hard to think. I didn’t know how or why I was there. In the midst of me trying to put it together, the loud ticks of the clock began to scare me.

When I left the couch, I stopped short of the hallway. It was pitch black, like the shadows swallowed the light, just like it was outside my parents bedroom. My foot would inch forward only to retreat back to where it started. The tile grew warm under my feet. I had to face the dark hallway. It was that or stay alone with the sounds of the clock. 

I ran all the way back to her room and bolted up the ladder and dove underneath the covers, where I stayed for the rest of the night. I only created a small hole with the blankets so I could breathe. The rest of the night I spent awake wondering why my family left me alone. All these years later, and I am still afraid of the silence, uneasy with the clock’s ticking. 

My eyes felt heavy again, and I didn’t fight them. My hands slowed until they were resting on my cat. My thoughts became mangled into incoherent knots. As my eyes opened less and less, a scratching at my window sent me flying straight up. My poor cat was once again fleeing from my sudden movement. 

Straining to hear over the sound of my heart in my ears, I listened intensely. My window is directly above my head where I slept. I turned my body slowly to face the curtains that separated me from whatever was outside. I wanted to believe it was my sister’s dog because she does scratch my window on occasion when we make her sleep outside for the night. Then the recent memory of the shape outside the kitchen door made me feel queasy.

Cursing my stupid need to know, my hand hovered outstretched inches from the curtain. There was more scratching; I hesitated. My hands moved before my mind was fully ready. The scratching stopped; it didn’t sound right, the sound fading out rather than an immediate stop. I couldn’t see anything out the window. The condensation covered my window too; behind the grey, there was no light. I couldn't muster the courage to put my face against the window to try and see better, so I shut the curtains close as fast as I had opened them.

After a few minutes of sitting with my fear, I opted to change the video on the TV. Something with a person, someone funny. That didn’t work though. It was like the remote was malfunctioning. The only things I could do with it were fast forward, rewind, pause the video, and set the sleep timer. I couldn't even turn off the TV. 

1:00. I don't know when I fell asleep. One moment I was looking at the TV, frustrated with my inability to change the video; the next I realized I was staring at the clock. This time, by my count, the third time, it had hit 1 AM. There was no way that it could have been 1AM again. The date was still October 5th, so it’s not like I somehow slept into the next day, and the TV was still on, playing the same video. It hasn’t finished yet. 

It looked like it barely progressed from when I was awake. With my phone out of commission, I only had one less option. I reluctantly decided to go to my sister’s room. I would tell her about the scratching to try and save a bit of my ego. 

I stood in the hall in front of her door; I held my hand in front of the doorknob similar to how I held it in front of the curtain, suddenly afraid to make a sound. Before my brain had time to reject the motion, I pulled on the knob.

The door wouldn't budge. I lost my fear of making noise and was filled with a new panic of not being able to get to my sister. I rattled the knob, then smacked my hand against the door before finally slamming my body against it. It didn’t move at all. It made no noise at all. I stepped back from the door. That same feeling I felt in the kitchen began to chew my insides. I couldn't handle being in the hall anymore; I couldn’t stand being alone. 

Panicked and confused, I went searching for my cat. I turned the whole house upside down using nothing but my phone flashlight and red and purple Halloween string lights. None of the switches in our house worked. The ones outside were still obscured by the condensation on the glass. It gave the kitchen a faint red glow.

The sound of my feet slapping against the tile and the ticks of the passing seconds yelled in my ears. I couldn’t find him anywhere. Our house was not very big, so he would not be able to hide from me for this long. I had spent an hour total from the moment that I tried to get into my sister’s room until now trying to find my cat with no luck. I could feel the tears welling in my eyes and hiccups forming in my chest. My vision blurred as I kept searching frantically. 

I hadn’t even noticed that I was standing inches from the sliding glass door. Still so thick with condensation, it might as well have been another wall. Even now the red was starting to be blocked by the condensation. My hand was barely touching the lock, and it was bolted. Did I lock it? Or was it always locked? I blinked away more tears while my head swam from it all.

The water drained out of my head, from my soul, when I heard the first voice in hours? Days? “Hello?” It didn’t sound right. Distant or underwater, I could almost feel the words drifting through the air. Almost the way the scratching sounded when it stopped. I looked everywhere and saw nothing. I turned my flashlight back on and searched again to no avail. I started to convince myself that I had imagined it when it spoke again. “It’s so dark; let me inside.” In the time it took for the sentence to reach me, my legs had already begun to move.

I ripped up the hallway just like my cat. I made a flying leap into my bed and backed into the furthest corner. I stared unrelentingly at my open door. I was in such a rush I had neglected to shut it behind me. For several seconds I could only make out the sounds of my racing heart before I could hear the video on my TV; my fan had shut off again. I stayed in that state for several minutes before pulling my eyes away when I didn’t hear anything else. Sweat began to drip down again, but I didn't want to turn on my fan. I needed to be able to hear despite wanting to drown out whoever that is outside my house.

I woke up coughing and hacking, struggling to breathe. It was as if I was being buried alive, the weight of dirt choking me out. I stayed still, trying to slow my breathing down to a normal level. Considering the voice I’d just heard, there was no way I had fallen asleep, but there I was. I was lying flat; the video was still playing; it was still night outside. 

My eyes take a sweeping scan of the room. Despite all the fibers of my being urging me not to leave my bed, I still managed to walk to my door. Poking my head out into the hall, I couldn’t see anything past the middle of the hallway. My sister's room was no longer visible. The bathroom barely made the cut. The darkness that swallowed the outside of my house had leaked inside now. 

I stared at the endless void just beyond my room and felt my cheeks become wet. I blinked a few times, and tears fell with it. I sobbed silently as the video continued, further back than when I last messed with it. I don’t remember the last time I even touched the remote to do that. I didn’t know how much time had passed; it could’ve been days at that point. I never felt hungry and never felt thirsty. I only went to the bathroom once and never had to go after that.

Scratching came from outside my window again. I stopped looking into the dark beyond and then at my curtains separating me from the outside world. There was nothing left besides half the hallway and my room. I didn’t know how much longer that would stay true. The scratching stopped for a few beats; I was ready to walk back to what little safety my bed still provided before the scratching started again. But it came from inside the house.

I threw the door shut and dove under my covers. My breathing was ragged; no matter how deep of a breath I took, I never felt like I got enough air. It was only made worse when the scratching was outside my door. I gripped the covers harder. “ I’m scared of the dark,” the horrible excuse for a voice whimpered. Tears rolled profusely down my face. More scratching, like pieces of the wood were chipping away. The only thing I could think to do was find the remote and turn the video louder. 

I slowly pulled my head out, seeing the door still kept the thing out. The scratching had stopped for the moment. I held my breath, multitasking, searching for the remote and listening for the thing. My fingers brushed it, and I used the tips of my fingers to pull it closer. My thumb jammed the volume up just as another round of scratching began. In an instant I heard the claws of it drag, drifting further down the hall.

Not wasting any time, I grabbed my fan and jammed it under the door in a weak attempt to make it harder to open. I used to do it to my sister when she’d chase me around the house. With nothing left, I crawled into bed. 

“You got lost.” An echoing voice drifted from the TV. The sound slowly made its way to me just like the voice of the creature outside my room, but there was something different about this one. It sounded human, a child. Maybe even more than one; the echo made it hard to tell. 

“You are lost.” I unconsciously nodded my head. The TV played the video and did not change; it was still the same mining and block placing I’d been watching all night. It still sounded like the words floated to me from the TV, though. The “no commentary” advertised in the title of the video became clickbait. 

“You have to leave this place and go back home.” A snort shot from my nose. I was staring into my blanket now.

“Like I haven't tried all night,” I whispered. To a person in the room, my words would've barely been audible. 

“ You haven’t.” My eyes flicked to the TV, where the voice with a lot of nerve spoke. The video was different now; the player stopped just standing in the rain, staring at the black cat they had tamed at some point. I couldn’t recall ever seeing the player tame the cat. The cat was unmoving for what would be an inordinate amount of time in the game. “ Find your way back.”

“How?” I snapped, my voice still low but louder than before. The player still did not move and continued to stare at the black cat; it let out a meow. I missed my cat. 

“ Guide yourself back; keep the lights on.” Cryptic answers, of course. I picked up my remote to chuck at the TV, gripping it until my hands started to shake, but I ended up setting it back down. “We are waiting.” There was more than one after all. 

I could feel my eyes grow heavy again, like sleep was waiting to pull me under. I shook my head violently; I didn’t want to go back to sleep. I didn’t know what it meant to guide myself. I sat on my bed, unable to move, unable to attempt to help myself. “ We are waiting,” it repeated. Going entirely limp, I fell back into my bed. My eyes shut before I hit the pillow. 

I found myself standing in front of my closet. I had just lost consciousness; how could I have been there? Looking around more, let me notice the nightlight that was lying on the floor. I’d never owned a nightlight in my life; it was not mine. I went to grab it, and I didn’t have my hands at all, not for a few moments at least. They began to flicker back into view. 

With my hands appearing normal, I held the nightlight in my hands. It was a crescent moon with little craters molded into the plastic. I moved it between my fingers, rolling it to the back, and saw that it could plug into the wall and could be turned on without the need of an outlet. It turned on as soon as the button clicked. A warm yellow emanated from it, quite bright considering its size. I could’ve sworn it was almost warm. 

Before I had the chance to pretend that things were going to be okay, the hairs on my arm stood up. The warmth nearly vanished entirely; a cold sweat started to take its place. My chest felt heavy again. I was fighting a cough, not wanting to make much noise.

I had a sense that there was someone in my closet. The feeling came suddenly and persisted even after a few seconds of standing and listening. I had no evidence to believe this. The curtain remained undisturbed as I stood there. Then the feeling of another presence resided both outside the door, like the creature was waiting patiently there, and in the closet. It was silent. My video played with the sound off; only the nightlight protected me now. 

My hands went up on their own accord. I held them out in front of me, inches away from the curtain. I wasn’t sure what the plan was. I don't think I was entirely in control anymore. I held my hands there for a second, just like with my sister’s door and my other curtain. Then I made one swift movement; I was holding the wrists of a person. Fully gripped with my left and only two fingers enclosed on the right. The nightlight was held with the other three fingers. 

I clamped my jaw to stop a sob from escaping. I could feel their wrists in my hands, and yet they made zero movement outside of a recoil from my grab. No noise, no movement, nothing. Like it was a statue with a fleshy feel. The air left my lungs, and I struggled to breathe. I stood there for some time, I don’t know how much time, not moving an inch. I never fully regained my ability to breathe. I continued to struggle. The longer I stood, the harder it got. 

I readjusted my grip on the person, and still there was no reaction from them. Maybe "fleshy statue” wasn’t the right descriptor anymore; more like a fleshy puppet. My legs began to step backwards; I begged internally for them to stop, but they never did. I was slowly becoming a passenger in my body, suffocating all the same. One step, two steps; I walked back. The person began to follow with silent footsteps. The curtain extended like a never-ending handkerchief from a clown’s sleeve, a veil separating the two of us. 

Without ever breaking eye contact with the thing, I was forced to continue to walk backwards. The realization that I was about to walk backwards towards the door of my room hit me like a truck. I tried to scream. Nothing would come out of my throat. Only raspy squeaks come out, nothing else. I couldn’t stop my feet and couldn’t yell out. All I could do was watch in horror.

The air chilled around me, my right hand warm with the light of the nightlight. I should’ve hit the door, but instead I think I phased through it. I got tunnel vision that slowly closed in. Despite the nightlight in hand, nothing could be seen. I only imagined I was in a room painted wall-to-wall with the darkest black; there was nothing for the nightlight to help me see. All I could see was the curtain, still extending, and the fabric pressed against the person’s figure.

 “Aren’t you scared of the dark?” The thing could almost be described as snickering at my peril. I could only move my eyes; no amount of struggling against my body would let me try to move the nightlight to provide me sight. My legs dragged me backwards still. I prayed for the protection of the nightlight to save me. The laughter, if you could call it that, came from all sides. I found the tiniest bit of solace in how distant it sounded. Maybe the light kept it away after all. 

Despite no sign of being able to regain control, I still struggled for it step after step. That was until I had backed into something. My body turned casually to see that I had bumped into my bed, despite leaving my room moments ago. 

Then I noticed there was a person in my bed. The blankets hugged a body, but blankets covered it head to toe like a corpse. 

I turned back to the figure and realized I had let go of the wrists. I only clung to the nightlight now. My eyes trailed the light that got me there safely up to the thing. I hoped one more time I would be protected. I was too paralyzed to move. I don’t know how long I stood there staring at the person masked by the curtain; it was too long. Then it moved on its own. My stomach fell out of my body. 

When I could get my body to move, I backed to the furthest corner of my room, maybe only a foot or two away. I slammed down onto the carpet with a muffled thud. My bookcase dug into my back with how hard I pressed myself backwards. I noticed then that my closet was no longer in my room; the curtain stemmed from the black void beyond the door to my room. 

I could remember a dream I had years ago where I was in a similar position. Instead of being in my room, I was back in the furthest corner of my kitchen, curled on the floor with my knees to my chest. I knew in that dream logic type of way that if I stayed there and did not walk around my house, I would be safe. I, with all the hope I had left, tried to do the same. My knees were pressed to my chest, tucked right under my chin. The nightlight was firmly gripped, barely lighting a small area around me.

The scratching echoed from the void; all I could do was cling harder onto myself. The person did not come towards me. It went straight to my bed, the curtain continuing to stretch with the figure. The person seemed to walk through my bed to get to the body. Although I couldn’t tell for sure, I thought that the figure in the curtain laid down on top of the body. It sank down until it was just as I found it. 

There was a pause, silence, before the curtain then seemed to explode outward in all directions. Flowing like water, it filled up the room quickly, approaching me. In my attempts to get away, the carpet turned into a sticky substance. I was sinking, and it became hard to pick up my feet. The curtain glided easily over the liquid carpet, unaffected. In my desperate attempts to flail away, I fell. Half my body was entrenched in the carpet, and I could do nothing but accept my fate. 

Like a wave crashing into you at the beach, the curtain hit and overtook me. My vision stripped from me, the last thing I saw was the nightlight. I tried to keep my breath steady, counting slowly. Somewhere far away I heard a ticking, a clock. A grandfather clock chimed once; my eyes opened.

My vision was entirely obscured, still drenched in darkness. I clawed violently out in front of me when I realized I was entirely under my blanket. When I freed myself from the shackles of the blanket, my eyes first landed on my alarm clock; it was 5:59. Then, like a miracle, the time rolled over to 6 AM. Tears rolled down my face gently.

I let the tears flow; in the middle of wiping my tears away, I thought I saw the curtain to my closet move. My body had gone rigid. My breath was caught in my chest. I swiped violently at the tears from my face to be able to see clearly. There was the tiniest movement in the curtain directly in front of me. As if it had just finished swaying from someone moving it. 

It had long since stopped moving when I looked at the time. Ten minutes had passed. I regained feeling in my legs and grew the confidence to get up to check the closet. I stood exactly how I just had, arms slightly stretched out and hesitating. Eventually I reached out to grab; this time I was relieved to grab nothing.

I pulled the curtain open to reveal the contents of my closet. No one was there. I scanned the small space only to find one thing that shouldn’t have been there. On top of my blankets, which were folded neatly on the bottom of the closet, was a nightlight. I stared at it then glanced around my closet; nothing else was out of the ordinary.

Picking it up, it appeared embedded in the design between the craters of this moon was a name written on it. Mara. That wasn’t my name; I don’t know who it was. It wasn’t there while I fought my way back here. I had a horrible feeling wash over me; it made me check over my shoulder, but nothing was there. I almost unconsciously went to my outlet and plugged it in. 

The sweet sound of purring broke me from my dissociating state. I picked him up and hugged him until he let out an annoyed meow. I tiptoed to the edge of my room and barely poked my head out to look down the hall. The house was exactly as it should be. Halloween decorations and all. I crept out towards my sister's room, looking into my parent’s room as I passed. The windows were clear, showing my sister’s dog sleeping on top of the metal table in the sun trying to warm up. Holding my cat in one arm like a mother would, I grabbed my sister’s door and let myself inside. 

I didn’t wake her, but seeing her was enough; the tears rolled some more before I left her room once more. Getting back to my room, I barely caught my phone as it was shutting back off. I had gotten a notification. Checking it brought another smile to my face. He woke up greeting me with a good morning text and a long smiling emoticon under that. My cat in one hand, phone in the other, I looked at the nightlight, slowly feeling warm from its protective yellow glow.

I write this here to see if anyone else has experienced this or not. I can’t go tell anyone else this; they wouldn’t believe me. But I know that I am not crazy. That night light did not exist before last night. I also write this here as a warning. I couldn’t tell you how to avoid it, so I don't think it can help you much. All I can say is this: be careful when you're falling asleep. You might get stuck in Hypnagogia.
