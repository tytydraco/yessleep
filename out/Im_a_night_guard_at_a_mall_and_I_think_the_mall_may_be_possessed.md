Part 1

Hi, my name is Jake. I’m a night guard at a mall in Kingston, New York. Weird things happen here during the day and even more at night. The worst time seems to be 3 AM, which is the witching hour, so it makes sense.

I should have raised a bunch of red flags when the hiring manager told me that the last five night guards only made it through one week. But my stubborn, happy-go-lucky self took the job anyway. I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

I only know that weird things happen during the day from the other mall cops at shift change. Yes, I am technically a mall cop or rent-a-cop, whatever you want to call me. Go ahead. Nonetheless, extremely strange things happen here: noises that aren’t there, store entry dings when gates are closed, and perhaps the strangest of all is at 3 AM when you sometimes see the wallpaper curl up or a humanoid figure crawling on the ceiling. Sometimes you just hear children singing. Those were definitely the scariest times of my life. That was five years ago, and now that I’m unemployed and desperate again, I think I’m going to go back. I just hope things have changed or something has been figured out about those strange occurrences.

I walked into the office dressed just as I had for the initial interview five years ago. My boss, Charlie, got wide-eyed, and a big smile spread across his face. “JAKE!” he exclaimed. "Glad to see you, buddy. How have you been?" he asked. I muttered, “I’ve been better, but I’m in desperate need of a job.” His demeanor darkened, and he told me to take a seat. He explained that the other night guard went missing a few days ago, and even the day shift girl who would normally cover my shift went missing. Was it the mall? Was it something else? I’m not sure.

I told Charlie I’d take the job. He smiled, filled out some paperwork, and asked if I could start that night. I stupidly said yes, not thinking about my sleep schedule. It was already 3 PM, so if I could fall asleep, it would only be for about an hour, then I’d have to go in. 8 PM to 8 AM. Twelve-hour days suck, but they pay the bills.

I went home and fell asleep for about 45 minutes when I was awoken by a car crash outside my window. I brushed it off, as things like that happened all the time at my busy little intersection. Nonetheless, I tried falling back asleep to no avail. Around 5:00, I got dressed, pinned that little badge on my shirt, and laced up my polished shoes. Lastly, I made sure my flashlight had batteries. I also took a moment to mentally prepare myself for the night ahead. I don’t think anyone could prepare themselves for what happened over the next few weeks.

That night started like any other, with stores closing at 10 PM and me doing my rounds to ensure no teenagers were still sneaking around the mall. After I cleared the building of all its occupants, I closed and locked the door. That's when strange things happened. The first thing was a whisper coming from deep inside the mall: “Jake,” it muttered. I brushed it off as Charlie using the intercom and went on with my night. Oh, by the way, Charlie typically stays until about midnight, working the cameras in the control room.

“FUCK OFF, CHARLIE!” I yelled as I flipped off a camera. Nothing else really happened that night except for around 3:20 AM when I heard the familiar singing of children. "Ring Around the Rosie," they sang softly. At 6:30 AM, I opened the doors for store employees to come in. That was the end of the first night of the scariest month of my life.

I went home and crashed on the couch watching TV when I was awoken around 5 PM by a loud explosion near my apartment. Again, I brushed it off as nothing. But now that I look back on it, maybe the universe was trying to tell me something. I did my same little routine and went off to work. Same exact routine: 10 PM, make sure hooligans are out of the mall, yatta yatta yatta. You get the point. I locked the doors and started making my laps. I saw that the gate to GameStop was still open, so I went in to make sure everything was alright and I was good to close the gate and arm the alarm. When I went to the back, I saw a door that I had never before seen in this mall. I brushed it off as a storage closet and went along with my night. 3:30 AM... there’s that creature crawling on the ceiling again. Been there, done that. Oh well… another end to a boring night.

I went home and decided to play some Call of Duty on my Xbox, and one of the weirdest things happened. I saw both my missing coworkers online... you know, the two that went missing. Maybe it was something where they had left their Xbox on or maybe it was just a glitch. I don’t know, but nonetheless, it was weird.

I finally went to bed and got about 4 hours of sleep before work and then the same old routine again. Charlie called in sick today, so it looks like I get to man the cameras all night tonight. Let’s go, I celebrated a little bit in my head. Easy night ahead.

When I got to the mall, I checked in with the second shift, and they notified me of a code yellow, or a missing child, that went missing around 6:30. The mother waited in the security office patiently awaiting any news of her child showing up. Looks like tonight might not be so easy after all, I muttered under my breath.

I did a couple of laps looking for the child, making sure not to say their name since that’s what they taught us in training. Something about if it was an abduction the kidnapper may be tipped off. I searched the normal stores, you know, the candy store, toy store, GameStop… wait, that door was open. You know the door I saw the other night. And it’s a staircase. “I didn’t know we had a basement,” I muttered under my breath.

I had to go down there for the child; it is my job to protect this mall at all costs. Yes, I sound like a bit of a sellout saying that, but I did in fact take an oath. I started down the stairs, and this is where shit got really fucking creepy.

I think I had seen something similar on Reddit a few years back; I think it’s called a liminal space. Somewhere that feels familiar but you’ve never actually been there. And I don’t know, this seems like something I’d see at a hotel when I was a kid with my parents. It was like a long corridor of doors. I looked behind me to see no door out of here. “What the fuck,” I told myself.

I continued on down the hallway, checking the doors, every one of them being locked. In that moment, I heard a blood-curdling screech from down the hall maybe 15 doors away. It didn’t sound human. “FUCK!” I yelped, turning around and running back the way I came. Almost exactly where I came into this weird-ass hallway, I fell right back out, but this time into a Kohl’s changing room. The lights were off, and I assumed the store was closed. I walked out armed with only my flashlight. I checked my phone and saw that only about 3 hours had passed even though it felt like I was down there for days. Anyway, it’s 11 PM and the mall is closed. I stayed in the control room with all the lights on the rest of the night.

Night 3 was definitely the most eventful thus far, and I’m beginning to think that there may be something that possesses this place. I’m not sure, but I don’t really want to find out. But something tells me that I will have to go back there in the future. Something also tells me that’s where Chuck and Olivia are... the other two night guards. But I obviously can’t be certain. I don’t think I’ll tell Charlie about this, not yet anyway. When the clock finally dinged, signifying my freedom from tonight’s hell, I got out of that place as quickly as possible.

I went home and turned on the news to see that the child who went missing last night was found dead by the lake behind the mall. They were asking for information about anyone who may have seen anything. I’m afraid I believe it was not someone but rather something that killed him. “This mall isn’t right,” I told myself. But I needed the job, and the pay was decent. Decent enough for me to have a studio apartment and food in the cupboards. I don’t know how much longer I can take that place, though, especially after last night’s events. “Are Olivia and Chuck dead as well?” I asked myself. Or are they still in that never-ending hallway? I fell asleep on the couch and slept until my alarm at 6:30 PM. I got dressed and started my commute to the mall.

When I got there, Charlie told me until further notice we’d be working double shifts, which means two of us would be on the night shift. It was me and Charlie until he could hire someone else. I did my normal routine of the night, then just sat in the camera room with Charlie watching Netflix for the remainder of the night. Thankfully, night 4 wasn’t eventful. I don’t know if it being Sunday meant the evil or whatever it was didn’t act up or something. But I’ll take a quiet night.

I went home and did all my weekly chores, including my run to the grocery store. On my way over, I heard on the radio that the remains of a human body was dug up by the vacant lot near the mall. I was intrigued, so I followed the story on my local newspaper website. They said dental records would tell exactly who it was and they’d announce it after the next of kin was notified. I fell asleep around 2 PM and woke up at 6:45 PM. When I woke up, I turned on the news and the name of the body was released: Olivia Bower. It was her. She was found. There was a little card at work to sign to send to her husband and kids. I thought about the times I’d lie about being sick because I wanted to go out and drink all night. I’m thankful for her; she was a good soul.

That night was just as uneventful as the last. Not much happened, and Charlie actually let me go home early so I could start my weekend a little earlier. During my weekend, I did a lot of research on the mall: missing persons reports, deaths, weird occurrences—all within like a 10-mile radius of the mall. And actually, now that I look at it more, the exact middle point is... the GameStop.

That's the end of part one of my findings, as it is the end of my week. I need some sleep. I’ll try to answer any questions in the comments, and I’ll try to get part II posted as soon as possible.
