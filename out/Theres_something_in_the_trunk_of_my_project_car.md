“Hey man, don’t forget your coat. Are you sure you don’t want a ride home?”

“Nah, not with how many beers you just drank. It’s nice and cool out, and I’d rather walk back anyway.”

“Fair ‘nuff. Would you mind closing the garage door when you leave?”

“No problem, see you in the morning.”

Floyd grabbed his white bomber jacket from the back of the chair he’d been sitting on and threw it over his shoulders as he wished me luck for the next day. We’d spent all day in my garage, putting the finishing touches on the car. By the time the sun had set, we were ready to call it a day and relax with a few hard-earned beers before the meetup in the morning.

I crashed on the sofa with another bottle, letting my mind drift off to sleep. I’d spent the better part of two years saving up for a project car, and six months after that waiting for parts to start slowly coming in the mail before I could finally start putting it all together. All-in-all, I was proud of what I was able to do with the car. The engine repairs had been ongoing for months, so it was refreshing to spend the day with my friend making little quality-of-life or cosmetic changes. I’d taken the morning to put in an LED aftermarket stereo and the afternoon to install the carbon fiber duckbill spoiler, while Floyd volunteered to spend the bulk of the day wiring up and installing the new remote start. My Honda S2000 was show-ready, at least by our amateur standards.

I woke up the next morning around 10:45. I swore under my breath, wondering why Floyd hadn’t called yet; I was supposed to pick him up at his place for the meetup almost two hours ago. I threw on a clean pair of jeans and quickly made my way towards the garage. 

As the humid morning air hit my face, I rolled my eyes to see Floyd had forgotten to close my garage door on his way out, leaving my pride and joy open to the elements. A quick once-over didn’t show any signs that anyone or any wildlife had messed with anything, but it annoyed me nonetheless. I hopped in the driver’s seat and excitedly pressed the new “push to start” button sitting neatly where my key ignition had been the day prior. I felt the hum of the engine, the reverberated roar of the additional horsepower echoing through my small garage. I didn’t think I’d ever get used to how much more powerful this car felt compared to my everyday use Prius.

Floyd didn’t pickup his phone when I called him while driving over to his apartment just down the road. By the time I pulled up it was almost eleven, and knowing there were only a couple precious hours left at the car meetup, I left him a short voicemail apologizing for being late and hoping I’d see him there somehow.

As I pulled out of his parking lot and made my way towards the highway, I decided it would be fun to test out how fast I could get the car to go. This was partly to see how much the new spoiler helped, but mostly because after all the modifications we’d made, I hadn’t taken her out for a real spin yet. 

I was disappointed to find that despite the roar of the engine, she was feeling sluggish, as though there were something holding her back. No matter how hard I pressed my foot on the gas, I couldn’t get up to nearly as much speed as I’d hoped for. I barely had to put on the brakes in order to get back down to the speed limit when I passed the local speed trap, which broke my heart just a bit.

When I pulled up to the meet, I found an empty parking space near the edge of the cluster of cars being ogled by enthusiasts. I pulled in and looked around to see if Floyd had managed to get a ride from someone else, but he was nowhere to be seen.

I rolled down the convertible roof and awkwardly stood around waiting for someone to come check out the car, shooing off the occasional bumblebee. I had attended many of these meetups as an onlooker but never as a participant, and I wasn’t sure how to behave to get people to look at my ride. By noon, I gave up entirely and closed my roof, letting myself go look at the admittedly much nicer cars.

Everyone began dispersing and packing up at close to 1:00, and I begrudgingly accepted that I probably had a lot more work to do before my car was really ready to be shown off like the prize I knew she was. I walked back to my lonely parking space and leaned against the trunk for a few moments, letting the cool air blow through my hair while I quietly watched the ants swarming in the grass behind the curb under the hot summer sun. As the last of the remaining cars peeled out of the lot, the silent march of the ants was broken by a large black wasp, hurriedly dragging a crumpled black tarantula across the dry dirt until it came to a small hole in the ground. It pulled the spider inside, disappearing for a few short moments until it emerged, lazily flying away. 

The car’s sluggish groan annoyed me to great lengths on my way home. As I tried speeding down the highway, I called Floyd again but he still didn’t pick up. I hoped he wasn’t mad at me for forgetting him that morning, but more importantly I hoped he’d made it home safe the night before.

I pulled into my garage, telling myself I’d wait to fix whatever was dragging the car down the next time I could get ahold of Floyd to work on it with me. By the day of the next meetup a month later, that time had not yet come. I’d gone by his place on a few occasions and called him more times than I could count, but he seemed intent to avoid me like the plague. I wondered if I’d said or done something to upset him while drunk the last time we’d hung out, but I couldn’t recall anything that would have upset him.  

I hadn’t so much as touched the S2000 between the two meets. I’d gotten around in my day-to-day car, not wanting to mess with the project without my friend, hoping we’d reconnect soon. As I hopped in, I decided to make my way to the meetup location with the roof down, to feel the cool air on my face as I drove. I thought to myself as I opened it up that I must have spilled some soda in my garage somewhere, as the faint smell of sugar wafted past my nose, insects swarming around the sweet odor in the air.

The engine problem was, of course, still present, if not worse than before. There was no way in hell that the car I had spent months benchmarking was performing this poorly, unless it was somehow just that much heavier after the modifications. I knew the weight distribution on this car was supposed to be damn near perfect. Something was screwing with it, either the suspension sagging or something weighing down the rear axle.

The realization hit me like a brick, and I made a hasty u-turn back towards my house. I hadn’t checked my trunk yet, and if Floyd had forgotten his hefty toolbox in there, there could be significant unaccounted weight on the back of the car, screwing up the balance and the performance. Maybe there was some mixup, and he somehow thought I’d stolen his tools. It was a long shot, but this could fix both of my problems. 

I pulled back into the garage, eager to confirm the source of the extra weight. As I reached to grab my key and unlock the small trunk, my heart sank; Floyd had replaced the physical key with the remote start and electronic fob, but I wasn’t sure where he’d put the old physical key. I could have sworn I’d left it unlocked in case something like this happened, but it wasn’t budging. 

I nearly tore the garage apart looking for it. I searched through every shelf, in every pile of tools or hardware strewn about, I even went through the trashcan in the corner. I missed the meet entirely, spending hours looking for the key, but it was nowhere to be found. At that point, I knew that there was only one person who could have it, and I hoped that he would finally show face. 

I pulled out of my driveway and tried calling Floyd one last time, but he still wasn’t answering. With my convertible roof down, I noticed something red sticking up out of the dry grass in the trees across the street that I’d somehow missed the past few weeks. I pulled over to the side of the road, and turned off the engine, stepping out of the car, my phone still ringing in my hand.

Sure enough, there on the side of the road covered in dried dirt and grass, was Floyd’s toolbox, sat undisturbed for over a month. 

I leaned back against my car to gather my thoughts, and felt the rhythmic hum of the engine subtly tickle my back. My phone finally gave up on attempting to call Floyd’s, and as the hum immediately stopped from behind me, I remembered that I’d already shut my engine off.

I sat frozen for a few moments, my hands shaking and sweating. I forced myself to move, to pick up Floyd’s toolbox from the ground and to locate what I needed. I pulled a small crowbar out of the mess of scattered tools and wedged it underneath the door of my trunk. I expected the crack of metal and a breaking lock, but was instead met with a crinkling sound, like the tearing of paper. The trunk opened with much less force than I’d expected.

Before I even looked, the overwhelming scent hit my nostrils, the interior of my small trunk smelling strongly of figs and honey. I lurched back in disgusted shock when I finally mustered the courage to look inside. Bundled inside, scrunched and cramped in the minuscule space, was some sort of biomass.

The cocoon clung to every possible surface like a damp scab except the inside of the trunk door that I’d just torn from it. Strands of fleshy resin latticed out from the central mass, a clearly humanoid husk of withered flesh and twisted bone. Clusters of fat, translucent bubbles trembled softly, pulsing with some internal rhythm as they now sat under the blinding sun. Beneath the webbed sponge of sweet-smelling gloop that encompassed the body, I could clearly see patches of shredded pale leather, once a pristine white bomber jacket.

As sunlight brought the abomination into view and warmed it in its heat, something inside began to stir. I stood utterly unable to react or even to breath as the nauseating crack of bone and the tearing of sinew became less and less muffled from beneath its shimmering moist surface, and as horrible bent appendages tore rapidly to escape.

Finally, after what felt like eternity, a single spiny limb broke through, pushing its hairy form through the mess. Another leg followed, and then four more followed by soft shriveled wings that filled themselves with a thin red fluid and hardened quickly in the air. When it finally pushed its full form out of the body cavity, it fell out of the trunk with a sickening wet splat on the pavement at my feet. The creature was about the size of a dog, and twitched on ground as it straightened out its glistening form. In mere moments, its soft and translucent exoskeleton bulged and solidified in the air, its dozens of compound eyes wildly twitching as it seemed to lock onto me.

By the time I let myself breathe and managed to make myself move, the wasp-like thing had already righted itself on the ground, preening its crystal wings while it prepared to take flight. I turned and made a mad dash towards my house, only to hear the horrible chitter of its enormous wings as the buzz of its flight neared me. I felt six spiny clawed legs grip my back and slam me into the ground, and I turned my head just in time to watch it rear its bulbous abdomen and plunge a six-inch stinger deep into my stomach.

I felt my body start to go limp, and with the last of my strength, I gripped the crowbar in my palm tight and jammed it straight into its side. A horrible wet fluid poured out of the creature’s abdomen, and it screeched as it retracted its barb from me, pulling away and retreating back into the air. I dialed 9-1-1 and drifted off into paralyzed numbness, watching as it haphazardly flew away into the woods.

I woke up in the hospital this morning. The doctors have had a lot of questions for me that I’ve been unable to answer, and the police still don’t believe what I’m telling them about the decomposed body in the trunk of my car. I regret calling 9-1-1 now, though. The doctors managed to get the toxins out of my system, but as a result I can feel what’s growing inside me, eating me from the inside out. I wish I was still paralyzed and sedated, because now I can feel every last second of what’s happening to me.
