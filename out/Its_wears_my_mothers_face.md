I grew up on the edge of Shiprock, New Mexico. One lonely road, a crumbling house, desert stretching into nothing. My mother, Navajo, always told me there were things that roamed the desert, things that wore your skin, your voice, your face, if you weren’t careful. I thought she was telling stories to keep me in line. I wanted to believe she was just afraid.

She disappeared the week after Christmas. Police said dementia, dehydration, maybe coyotes. I know better.

Three nights later, around 2 a.m., I heard knocking at the back door. Slow, deliberate. One… two… pause… one… two… three… My stomach dropped. That was her rhythm. She used it when I was a child, to call me to safety during storms.

I peeked through the frost-covered window. She—or someone—stood there. Barefoot. Hair dripping wet. But her face was wrong. Her eyes were too wide, too bright, hollow at the center. The smile stretched wider than humanly possible. The air smelled wrong—sweet, like flowers, but underlying it was rot and coldness. Something alive but not meant to exist.

“Mom?” I whispered.

Her head snapped toward me, jerking unnaturally. She smiled wider, teeth too long. “I’m cold. Let me in.”

Her voice… it was hollow, distorted. Not human.

I backed away. She scratched the glass rhythmically, deliberately, like carving a warning. Then she whispered something only I would understand:
“Don’t make me knock twice.”

I ran, locked my bedroom door, and didn’t sleep. Dawn didn’t help.

Outside, the snow bore footprints. Bare, human-shaped, but wrong. Toes splayed outward, reversed. No blood, no drag marks—just wrong.

Two days later, I found her wedding ring hammered into the barn door. The sheriff smiled politely. Coyotes, he said. Strange, he said.

That night, I burned the house down. Fire swallowed wood, memories, everything. I thought it would end.

It didn’t.

Years later, I returned. I shouldn’t have. The charred skeleton of the house stood against the horizon, wind whistling through burned beams like voices. The barn sagged as if listening. The smell hit me first: ash, smoke, and that cold, sweet rot beneath perception.

I walked the property. My footprints were the only ones in the sand—until I reached the well. Around it, wet bare footprints circled, deliberate, wrong.

Leaning over the well, flashlight trembling, I saw it: pale, folded against the stone, pressed like it was squeezing through reality. It wore her face. Hollow, stretched, wrong. Something had learned her and failed.

Then I heard knocking. Not a door. Not a window. Everywhere. Metal, stone, sand. One… two… pause… one… two… three…

I spun. My own face. Same scar from falling off a bike at ten. Same clothes. Smile too wide. Eyes unblinking, studying.

It spoke in my mother’s voice: “You came back.”

I ran. Drove until the gas light glowed red, until town lights appeared. But it didn’t stop. At night, my own voice whispers from under the motel floorboards:
“Don’t make me knock twice.”



It started small. At first, I heard whispers in my own voice when I was alone. Then I noticed subtle things—my reflection hesitating in the mirror, movements in the corner of my eye I didn’t make. My friends said I was acting strange, forgetful, paranoid. I thought they were joking.

One night, I woke to scratching at the bedroom door. Slow. Rhythmic. One… two… pause… one… two… three… I called my name—my own voice—but the scratching paused. Then a whisper: “I know you.”

I don’t know how long I stayed in that room. Days? Weeks? Time became meaningless. I started hearing the knocking everywhere: in the walls, under the floor, behind me on empty roads. And sometimes, it whispered things only I would know—memories, secrets, the private thoughts I hadn’t spoken aloud.

I began to lose track of reality. I would see myself outside, walking, watching, smiling when I didn’t. Mirrors were unbearable; my reflection sometimes lagged behind me, sometimes moved on its own. Once, I woke in the desert, far from my motel, my own voice calling me toward the charred house.

I can’t trust myself. I can’t trust anyone. My mother’s face sometimes floats in the periphery of vision, her hollow eyes studying me, stretching wider, smiling. And when I close my eyes, I see my own face, stretched and wrong, smiling back at me.

Last night, I woke to the knocking beneath the bed. Slow. Patient. One… two… pause… one… two… three…

I whispered back, only to hear the answer echo from inside my own head:
“Don’t make me knock twice.”

I don’t know who I am anymore. I don’t know what is me. I don’t know how long I have before the thing wearing my face learns it perfectly.

The worst part? I’m starting to recognize its voice when it speaks as me. I start to answer automatically, politely, even affectionately.

It’s patient. It’s learning. And I know that soon, it will be indistinguishable from me.

And maybe… it already is.
