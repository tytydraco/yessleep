My friend once told me about a school he wanted to apply for. He spoke a lot about it, and I thought to myself; could this be something for me as well?

  
The school was essentially a boarding school, where we would be living for a year together with other students around the same age as us. We were around 17 years old at the time and the vacation from school for the summer had just started. Where I live, we usually have two months off school in the summer. Me and my friends used to spend that time going to the beach, playing video games, and doing teenage activities in general. 

  
During this summer break as you may call it, me and this friend spent a lot of time together. And we spoke a lot about the future and what we wanted to do after school. We weren’t really the types to apply for the army, as it wasn’t mandatory to serve where we live.

  
So, this boarding school seemed interesting to us. It would allow us to study a subject and at the same time meet new people and travel a lot. The only con we had in mind was the fee we had to pay to go to this school, but I found out that we could get a scholarship and then pay it back later. My friend’s father didn’t really like the idea of this school when we mentioned how much it would cost. But we both still applied, nonetheless.

  
Later that summer I got accepted to the boarding school we applied for. I hadn’t had too much contact with the friend I applied with. And had no idea if he was ever going to attend. But I left home and travelled to the school to start the year. I thought to myself, “Why isn’t he here?”. We were supposed to go into this together, and now I was completely alone in a foreign place with unfamiliar people.  
The school was old, over a hundred years old, I think. Over the years the school had built new structures to the main building. To accommodate the number of students attending every year. Luckily the oldest part of the building only had offices and no sleeping facilities. We had to sleep at the opposite end of the building.

  
The rooms were simple. A small room with a bed, desk and window and a toilet with shower attached. Every room had a toilet attached to it, luckily. I couldn’t imagine having to share shower and toilets with complete strangers like that. The halls in this part of the building were all the same, and you could clearly hear anyone walking by in the hall. You could never tell whoever walked by, sometimes I would walk out of my room just to see who it was. Sometimes I never saw anyone in the hall, but always shrugged it off. Maybe someone slip right into their room, right?

  
After a while I started to make friends, some close and some who just passed by in my life. Some I still have weekly contact with today. The classes were going well, and we experienced a lot in terms of traveling and working for companies we never really thought we’d work with. From writing articles in an Asian country to interviewing professional athletes.   
Most of the time we spent at the school, and my room were not like the others. I never had any experiences like I had in this room before. I thought I was going crazy, but when I asked to change room all of it stopped happening.

  
Every night I slept in that room, I had a nightmare. Nightmares about people I knew to be dead or ancestors of mine. Most of them I had never even met, but they were all trying to contact me. Some dreams one dead person would try to talk to me, others there were many at the same time. None of them shared anything with me, it was like they all tried to speak to me but couldn’t. It terrified me.  
The worst dream I had wasn’t related to any dead person. It was however about a person who revealed themselves to be a person called Lilith. 

She was probably about 160cm tall and skinny, with a blue dress. Dark long hair and pale skin. She had this eerie look to her, as if there was nothing behind her bright blue eyes. She was beautiful and tried to flirt with me and become close to me in my dreams. I showed reluctance in her advanced, which apparently made her increasingly furious with me. It became even stranger when we started to have a battle, where we would throw spells at each other.  Eventually I would take complete control of the dream, as I was at the time a lucid dreamer and could control my dreams as I wished. It was at that point where she gave up on me and left. My dreams went back to the “Normal” dreams about dead relatives. 

  
After the dreams I had about this girl, I started to wake up every night between 03:00 am and 04:00 am. At the time I had no clue as to why I woke up, because usually if I wake up in the middle of the night its usually because of a nightmare I force myself out of. Every time I woke up I heard someone walking in the hallway, I was too scared to walk out of my room to see who it was but I assumed it was one of my friends going out for a quick cigarette. However, the steps weren’t the same anymore. They were slower and heavier, and the steps became louder and louder every night I woke up.

  
At one point I heard the footsteps right outside my room. My heart was racing at this point, I looked out of my window to see if anyone was outside smoking, and I didn’t see anything because of the fog that had surrounded the school building. I heard three slow knocks on the door. At this point I had gathered any courage I had left and left my bed and opened the door. What if it was just one of my friends who wanted to talk or have a cigarette with me? Or playing a prank on me for that matter.  
I opened the door slowly and looked down the hall, and to my surprise one of my friends were standing there looking at me with a very tired look. 

  
“Do you want to go for a cigarette?” he said.  

  
I looked quite bewildered at him, “Sure?”.

  
Now after that night I thought about that experience. I never told anyone at the time because who would believe me. And I didn’t think any of the friends I had at that school were into stuff like that. As time went on, I forgot about it all. Until the last night I were to sleep in that room.  
I woke up at the same time as I did before, around 03:00 am. I usually look at the time since it usually gives me a hint on whether it is a dream or reality. If it is a dream the time would go by a lot faster, but this time the time went by as it usually does in our waking hours. I had a look around my room, and I noticed I couldn’t move. I could look around, but I couldn’t move my body. When I looked towards my door my heart started to race.

  
To the left of the door stood a 2-meter-long shadow. It had no face, but I could feel a stare coming from it. It was leaning back and forth menacingly. Like it was trying to get a good look at me. I tried to close my eyes and open them again to see if it had gone, but it was still there. It didn’t move towards me or anything, just leaning back and forth. I did my best to calm myself down enough to get some sleep. I couldn’t move my body anyways, so why not try to close my eyes and get back into the dream world. This took some time, but eventually I woke up to a sun beam hitting my eyes from the window.
