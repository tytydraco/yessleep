Now normally I'm not allowed to share reports from the cases we handle but I don't even know what to do and I fear I'll die soon. I'll start from the beginning.

 Me and two of my coworkers were sitting out in the station on the night shift. It was a small town so we were the only station in the area. Around 12:30 the phone goes off. I pick it up and place it to my ear “hello county police station speaking how can I help you?” I say almost automatically however no response comes through. I ask again “hello? Is someone there? Is there a problem?” suddenly a low static comes from the other end and a woman can be heard crying “P-please come fast” followed by her address is all she manages to say before the sound of glass breaking is heard followed by static getting louder and louder. I hang up the phone a little shaken from the call.

 “What was that about?” Jackson, one of my coworkers, asked, “lady called said to head there fast” I said as I quickly put on my coat. Jackson got up and put his coat on as well “alright I'll come with you” he says and we both enter the garage. Jackson is quick to unlock the car and get it in the driver's seat. I sit on the passenger's side. As the garage door opens I can see that it's raining really hard out there “damn really raining hard” I say to Jackson who nods in agreement. The car roars to life and we head off seeing in the rain is very difficult and it's certainly not helped by the darkness. “I don't think I've ever seen a storm this bad” Jackson remarks trying his best to see the road ahead “yeah tell me about it” I reply also struggling to see. 

&#x200B;

Around two hours later we pull up a driveway to a lone house on the far side of town; the surrounding area is completely forested. We both step out immediately getting soaked by the rain and walk up to the front door. I knocked loudly on the door “this is the police we were called to this address” I said loudly however despite all that noise there was no answer. I try the knob and it opens revealing what looks like a standard country home. “Hello! We got a call to come here” I say again the only response I get is silence. “Lets just head in and look around” I nod in agreement. Me and Jackson both enter the house hands on our pistols just in case.

&#x200B;

As we walk there is yet to be any sign of a disturbance or anything at all for that matter. “Hey! Over here” Jackson calls me over “what's the matter?” I ask him. Jackson points at the television the glass has been completely destroyed and is scattered about on the floor. However based on where the glass landed it looks like it was broken from inside the tv it was still playing static despite the obvious damage. “What the?” I mutter looking at the damage. “Well something went down here. I'm gonna head upstairs, you mind checking here?” “y-yeah sure i'll look around” I reply to jackson as he heads up the wooden stairs to the upper floor . Looking around the living space I notice that glass is everywhere almost like the television exploded. However despite that it shows not a single sign of damage aside from the glass. “What the hell?” I mutter picking up some glass and storing it inside a bag. After gathering some glass for evidence I decided to check out the kitchen.

&#x200B;

 The kitchen is completely untouched looking perfectly clean the only thing of note is a radio sitting on the counter also emitting a low static. I turn to leave when the radio squeals to life, its static increasing in volume. “Four….Three….one….o-one ….Zero” a low metallic voice stutters out before returning to the low static it was making earlier. I snap around jarred by the sudden noise. I head over to inspect the small radio picking it up off the counter “am I hearing things or what?” I mutter to myself again as I look over the radio inspecting it closely I notice that the battery door on the back has been opened and both batteries are missing. “The hell?” I exclaim loudly as despite the obvious lack of power it still emits static. As I hold it in my hands the static increases in volume again and the same metallic voice from before stutters again “zero….z-zero….zero….z-zero” after finishing the static keeps getting louder before the radio catches fire in my hands “holy shit!” I yell before chucking the radio at the wall behind the counter. A loud thunk is heard as the radio slams against the wall before falling on the counter a small flame is still flickering from within. Despite the obvious flame and burn damage the radio static never ceases.

&#x200B;

I hear rushed footsteps descending the stairs “what's wrong” Jackson calls out hand on his pistol. “This blasted radio! It freaking caught fire in my hand!” I say to Jackson as he comes over to me I direct his attention to the still flaming radio on the counter. “Huh? How did it catch fire?” he looks at it understandably confused “no idea the things been reading out numbers then caught fire despite having no batteries” I explain Jackson was about to respond when the radio stutters out again “one….two….t-two….three” it says before returning to the low static drone it was emitting beforehand. “Well shit…” is all Jackson is able to say.

&#x200B;

In an attempt to direct us both away from the radio I inquire about is upstairs investigation “yeah there wasn't much up there to be honest all the doors were locked and I figured Id wait to see instead of just breaking them down” “well in any regard I think we need to get a whole investigation here this whole place doesn't sit well with me” I say to Jackson who nods in agreement. We both turn around ready to leave when the radio stutters again “Run…” it repeats over and over each time the static behind gets louder and louder the voice becomes more distorted. We head to leave when I notice the Tv has changed. Now it only displays a black screen; the word “Run” written in red text covers the whole screen. I turned to remark this to Jackson when all the lights in the house that were all off beforehand began to flicker in a consistent pattern. At that point both Me and Jackson ran to the door and got back in our car not wanting to be in that house any longer.

&#x200B;

 I pull out my phone to check the time and the screen shows me 1:30 AM. At this point I was tired, wet and outright terrified. “The hell was that?” Jackson exclaims “I wish I knew man..lets just head back to the station” i say my voice shaking slightly. Without any further words Jackson starts the car and begins to pull off the lot. We began the long drive back to the station, the rain still falling like bullets.

&#x200B;

Jackson decides to turn on the radio hoping to ease us both. The radio crackles a bit only playing a low static droning. Jackson tries changing the dials but nothing happens “the fuck is this…” Jackson mutters I just sit in silence. Suddenly the radio begins to emit a series of beeps in a repeating pattern. As I sit there I realize something about the beeping. “Hey uh Jack? Those beeps are morse code if my time studying it is any good I think it's saying…” I pause trying to translate the beeping stereo “I think it's saying to go faster?” Jackson grunts “great…our bloody radio is telling me to drive faster in this storm…remind me to never take the night shift again” suddenly much to our dismay the car comes to a jarring halt the engine practically screaming as it does. “You have got to be kidding right now” Jackson says the anger in his voice is clear. As he tries to start the car I look out the front.

&#x200B;

I freeze as there is something looking back. I can barely make out its features in the storm however some things I did see. The creature in front of the car was certainly humanoid as it was just above my Eye level far too tall for any animal. And then its eyes, oh god those eyes, the pupils were small and black shaking in all directions and the white of the eye? It was static like a tv screen. For a while it felt like time froze as me and whatever the hell it was stared at each other.

&#x200B;

Suddenly the car came on and so did the headlights and  the second the headlights illuminated the creature it screamed. It screamed a horrid sound. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard mixed in with several people screaming. And it was loud, me and Jackson both had to cover our ears from the sheer noise When the horrid sound ended, I opened my eyes. The creature was gone leaving no trace other than two broken headlights on our cruiser. I slowly uncovered my ears. They were ringing from the sound. My body felt heavy and it felt like I was drowning. I looked over to Jackson however I barely got to look before I blacked out.

&#x200B;

When I came to I was blinded by light I still heard the ringing in my ears as my eyes adjusted I saw a hospital. Next to me was an IV stand and as my hearing returned I heard the beeping of a heart monitor over the ringing. “Oh my god! Ethan you're awake!” a voice calls out. I recognize it as a good friend and coworker of mine “oh…hey Andrea” is all I am able to stutter out as I slowly turn to face her “thank god! I was so worried for you. You've been out for weeks”  weeks? I think to myself when suddenly it all comes back to me. That night, those horrid eyes, that monstrous scream. I only snap out of it when I hear Andrea call my name again

&#x200B;

“hey? Ethan? You alright? You look like you've seen a ghost or something”. I asked Andrea about what was going on and she explained it to me. Apparently two days after that case me and Jackson were declared missing. Our cruiser was found on the road with both headlights destroyed and the radio was on fire. Jackson was bleeding from his ears and passed out against the wheel and I was passed out in the passenger's seat. Emergency services were called and we were both taken to the hospital. It's been six weeks since then. 

When I finally asked her about Jackson's condition her face turned grim “as of now he's in a coma even if he does wake up his hearing has gone and he's suffered heavy brain damage survival odds are low…” I can see the sadness in her face. I curse myself for not doing something about that creature. Maybe I could have saved him, and that brings me here typing this out from a hospital bed. I'll leave it here. all I have left to say is 

&#x200B;

be careful when you hear static.
