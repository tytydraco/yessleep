I come from a very rural part of Bengal. Indian Bengal, that is. Not the other side.

Our village is very off-road, and most people don’t even know its name. Nevertheless, it’s a nice enough place.

Sure, the crops aren’t as bountiful as they could be, and there are issues with water unless it rains. The power often shuts off (it’s gotten better recently), and it’s only been a few years since we got a mobile network tower.

But the people are nice, and surprisingly, so are the landlords. Their money has ensured we have a better school and clinic than every village nearby, and they help out with loans whenever we need some cash, though I’ve no idea where it all comes from.

The only real problems are the things living around us. Not animals, though we do have those too: the forest is pretty dense, and there is a rumour of a tiger every few years. Most are false, but still.

No, the other kind of “things”. Things that are the reason you draw a cross with chalk on your doorway before leaving the house empty, or circle a lavatory three times before going in at night, or don’t stop to talk to what is very clearly your mother at a crossroads, noting that her feet aren’t quite sitting right.

Of course, the locals are mostly used to it. When a flayed woman is crawling on the road and moaning at midnight, tourists run. We tap our sticks three times on the ground to chase her off and continue. If there’s something truly dangerous, we tell the *Thakurs*, and in a few days, it goes away. Life continues. This is not about those stories, though I will probably tell them someday.

So, just like that, checking the desks for clusters of eyes before I sat down and sprinkling salt on my books if I ever left them outside my iron trunk by mistake, I completed my schooling in the village and applied for college, all the way out in Kolkata.

My father was sad to see me go, and angry that my marks weren’t enough for an even better college. But in a way, he was also happy. In the fashion of all Bengali fathers, he refused to show it, but he was. Happy that I was leaving this place, probably for good.

But that’s the beauty of my village: its power to pull you back with all its might. To do anything to bind you to its bosom, to make you stay.

They assigned a date for the entrance exam, all the way out in Malda. So, my father decided to escort me. The day before we left, there was news: Birendra *Thakur*, our landlord, was dead. It was whispered that the death had been unnatural. I had never seen my father like that in my life, a strange mixture of grief, fear, and anger writ on his face permanently as he paced around the village tea stall, asking question after question. In the evening, he asked me to cancel the exam.

It was a bad omen. Try again, he said. Next year. The death of a *Thakur* signalled that dark times were ahead.

I wasn’t sure what to think of that.

There were serious myths. The ones you could see. Feel. Be hurt by.

And then there were the fairgrounds, grandparents’ fairytale myths. The ones that felt nice to tell around a fire to scare children.

This seemed like the latter. One of those superstitions that grow louder whenever someone’s seen crawling their way to a better life. So, I refused.

He tried to convince me, but honestly? I was looking forward to getting the hell out of here, at least for a year or three.

Early the next morning, we set off on my friend Ramu’s trusty bike. The exam was in the afternoon, but Malda was far: not even counting stops for fuel and rest, we would have to hustle. The bus could have taken us, but its timings were too weird for our schedule.

So, we puttered on.

My father drove; I had a license, but typically, he didn’t trust me to not drive straight into a fuel truck and send half the highway up in a fireball. All because I’d almost hit a goat once on my first day out. Almost.

The road crunched under us, still fresh from some repair work. As we began to leave the village behind, cultivated fields and sparse houses gave way to empty meadows, milestones, and occasional clumps of trees. Through one of these, I saw the greyed-out building in the distance, almost half-hidden in a corner of the village. Even from this distance, the gleam of the once-shiny tracks, now bent and abruptly terminated, was apparent.

The old village railway station. It had been built all the way back in 1865, if memory served well. Some of the old men claimed it ran directly to Howrah Station itself at some point! That beggared belief, but at any rate, it had apparently been abandoned within a year of starting operations. No one could, or was willing to say why. As if the truth itself had left on the last train out.

The railway authorities just packed up and left, and the tracks were torn out by scrap sellers and vandals over the centuries, until all that remained was the hollow, crumbling ruin.

Still, seeing it gave me an idea.

“*Baba*,” I said, leaning in to make myself heard against the wind in our helmets, “going the full distance by road is going to be a close call. Why don’t we go to Jankipura and catch a local from the station? There are a few that will make it in time, and we have people there we can leave the bike with. It will be a lot easier to—”

“No.” The response was immediate, not a moment of hesitation behind it. “The people of our village do not ride trains. The *Thakurs* have forbidden it, ever since the old station was closed down.”

“What?”  I lived in the village, and it was my first time hearing that rule. “But why?”

“It is forbidden,” he repeated, firmly. “The law has been handed down from generation to generation. You can ask any of the old men and women in the village.”

“But why?” I repeated.

“I don’t know,” he admitted, “but your grandfather said it to me, and now I am saying it to you. Never ride on a train. For as long as you live. Never.”

This sounded like another one of the fairground myths.

“*Baba*, this exam is important. If something goes wrong on the road…”

“I told you not to take it this year,” he said brusquely. “You didn’t listen. Now you will bear the consequences. I’m not going on the train. End of discussion.”

When my father got to be like this, there was no arguing with him, so I shut up. But I was pretty sure our plans wouldn’t hold. They never did, out here in the country.

And lo and behold! I could not tell if it was fortune or misfortune then (though I now have a definitive answer), but within fifteen minutes of this conversation, our bike came to a screeching halt on the road alongside a swarm of other bikes, cars, scooters, and even some bullock carts. All were either honking or shouting.

At what, you might ask? A staple of the region: trucks full of farm produce, arrayed like a barricade across the narrow road, turnips and onions and rice and wheat and hay glistening under the sun as they spilt out from barely intact bags and sacks.

A bunch of men wearing some combination of *gamchas*, *dhotis*, *kurtas*, *pagdis*, and other assorted flairs fanned out before the truck, shouting slogans and hoisting placards. A few interested cameras flashed around them—local media, mostly—but the general mood was one of resigned annoyance. Indeed, some smart locals had already begun to capitalise on the hubbub, moving up with cycle-mounted canisters of tea and baskets of snacks to haggle with the many stranded commuters. A small crowd of spectators had also gathered around the event like flies, carrying babies on their hips, spitting *paan*, and murmuring among themselves.

“*Hartal*.” My dad’s tone was a combination of exasperation, annoyance, and indifference that could only be achieved through lifelong interaction with Indian politics.

“What’s up, brother?” I asked a man on a bike next to us, adjusting the strap of my bag nervously as he honked in impotent rage.

“Same old, *bhai*, same old,” he grumbled, finally surrendering and killing the ignition. “Government godown’s full, so they were turned away, and the APMC is not giving them the price they want, so now they’re dumping the crops on the street and protesting for more money. Every harvest, it’s the same fucking drama!”

I glared at the trucks, waiting for them to part before me. But I evidently did not have Moses’ skillset, because they stayed put.

“How long has it been, son?” My father asked.

“Barely two hours, uncle,” the man said, lighting a cigarette and offering him one. “Hope you don’t have to be somewhere within the next day or two!”

By the backhanded slap of providence, we had managed to stop right outside Jankipura. I knew this place well. The station was less than ten minutes from here. I’d never had cause to get on an actual train, but I tried to go there whenever I could, just to watch the bustle. In fact, if I squinted a little, I could even see its distinctive blue shed off in the distance.

And, above it, thick clouds of black smoke, ashy and choking even from this distance. Even as I watched, a new plume sputtered into the air: something was there, on the tracks, belching it.

I frowned. It almost looked like a steam engine. A very old, dirty steam engine.

I thought all the trains had switched to diesel locomotives. But diesel engines weren’t supposed to do that.

But that didn’t matter. Where there was smoke, there must be a train. Who cared if it was old?

“*Baba*,” I urged again, “We’re right outside Jankipura. If we move now, we can catch the train! I can see it! It’s right there!”

“*Beta*!” His voice was thunderous in its intensity. “I already said no.”

I glanced at the road, at the protest that showed no signs of abating, and anger coiled in my belly like a serpent.

“You just don’t care, do you?” I hissed. “You want me to miss this exam, so you can go home to justify your superstitious nonsense to your friends.”

“I don’t—”

“I told the boy!” I mimed in a mocking tone, “But he didn’t listen! And now, look! We were forced to come home partway! Truly, the younger generations know nothing.” I shook my head and tutted.

“Don’t talk to your father like that, he is your elder,” the man on the bike said.

“Oh, shut up!” I jumped off the bike. “Just go home, Dad. I’ll go by myself. If you’re so scared of a bloody tin box on wheels, you don’t have to come.”

“I told you!” my father bellowed, “You are not getting on that thing! Come back right now!”

“Bye,” I said simply, turning my back. “I’ll call you after the exam.”

I took off on foot, but I had barely been walking for a minute or two when I heard the telltale puttering of Ramu’s bike behind me once more, and my father slid to a stop beside me.

“Get on.”

“I’m not going back.”

“We’re going to the station!” his tone was terse. “Get on!”

I climbed onto the bike, half-expecting him to turn around and hit the throttle at full speed. But he actually did start moving towards the blue shed in the distance. He didn’t look left or right as he rode. He just stared straight ahead at the black smoke, barely even glancing at the road. Like a man transfixed by his own house burning down, feeling powerless to save it.

I wanted to say something, but I was half-afraid he would stop the bike and slap me if I pushed any harder. So, I stayed quiet, choosing to bask in my victory.

What struck me as we got closer was the silence. Jankipura was not the busiest station in the area. It wasn’t even a junction station, after all. But even so, you could always find at least a few men chewing *gutka* on the benches, or a fat lady passed out under the bent tree in the forecourt. If not that, you could always count on the old coolie sleeping on his cart, too weak to carry any luggage anymore but kept alive to work by sheer inertia.

But now, it was all empty. As we ascended the steps, even the occasional sound of birds in the air faded away. I heard my father murmur under his breath; probably a prayer.

“Maybe everyone’s already boarded,” I said as we stepped into the station proper. The words sounded absurd before they even left my mouth.

The platform was just as deserted, the few benches empty, tea stalls abandoned, newspapers flapping gently on stands in the breeze. A breeze that was warm, heavy with the promise of ash and rust.

Though I could never have admitted it out loud, I was beginning to share my father’s trepidation. Maybe there was a perfectly rational explanation, but my skin was tingling: that sixth sense one developed growing up in a place like Chhayagarh. The wrongness in the air that hung around when something was bleeding in from… the other side.

“So, are you sure the *Thakurs* won’t excommunicate us for this?” I joked, trying to ease the tension, but the air only grew tauter when he did not respond, his eyes frantic like a deer’s as they scanned the area.

For what felt like forever, we stood there, right on the threshold, somehow unable or unwilling to go deeper. Around the corner of the small archway that led onto the boarding platform, I could still see hints of that black smoke, occasionally coiling past in puffs. The air grew uncomfortable somehow, like I was wearing a straitjacket. Like it was trying to hem me in.

“Dad,” I finally whispered, my resolve cracking, “I don’t like this.” My knuckles whitened against the straps of my bag.

He glanced at me. “We need to leave. Now.”

“Leave? Nonsense!”

We both froze at the unfamiliar voice, heavy and drawling, studded with the polite indifference of customer service. There was a man now, before us, where there had been nothing an instant earlier. He was dressed in a sharp, archaic black waistcoat, tails expertly parting to the sides. A massive top hat, like that of a circus ringmaster, obscured his face, save for a toothy, practised grin. A gold pocket watch hung from a chain in his pocket, which he pulled and checked before closing the lid with a sharp snick.

“The train is already behind schedule, sirs, and we can’t leave without our final two passengers!”

He spoke in heavily accented English, barely legible. The few visible features of his face shifted even as I tried to focus on them, skin shifting from dark to brown to black to white to olive and in a thousand other hues. The only thing that lingered was that easy, ingratiating smile.

“Two… passengers?” I hesitantly pointed at myself.

The man laughed, leaning back, almost breaking in half like a wishbone before jolting upright again. His movements interacted weirdly with the world around him, seeming fundamentally wrong. He looked painted on, for lack of a better phrase, as if reality were a canvas onto which he had imposed himself as an altogether foreign addition. When he straightened, he held a sheaf of papers in his hand, which he quickly glanced through before pulling a page.

“Ah, a jokester in our bogey today! Look around, young man. See anyone else on the platform? Of course not! They’ve all boarded! And on time, if I may add.” He handed the paper to me. “There! Our last two names!”

The paper, which looked clean and waxed in his hands, crumbled and yellowed as soon as he handed it to me, streaks of suspicious red on its corners. It looked like a passenger manifest, but the only thing on it was a few words, scrawled without regard to fields and boxes. Like a child had mutilated it with a crayon.

Our full names. In a daze, I tried to hand it back, but it crumbled in my hands.

“Ah!” He raised his hands, which I now saw were covered in two white gloves. “Well, won’t need that anyway, now that I have who we’re expecting! Come, we’re already late!”

He was now behind us—no steps, no intervening movement, just present—his arms around our shoulders as he ushered us towards the smoke. He had us so off-kilter that we barely resisted, but it would probably have been useless anyway.

“God, the bosses would have my hide if they knew I left you standing here for so long!” he said with saccharine regret, talking directly into my father’s ear. “What kind of conductor am I? Lousy! Please don’t file a complaint. You won’t, right?”

We could barely stutter something out before he had thrust us into the smoke. A sharp smell immediately assaulted my nostrils, like burning hair and curdling eggs mixed with half-burning coal. The conductor hauled us forward even as we coughed and retched, muttering automated apologies under his breath. But after a few, painful seconds, the smoke fell away, rising now above our heads, and we beheld its source.

If not for the phone in my pocket, I would have believed we just travelled back through time. Standing in front of us, massive and powerful and resplendent in black and gold, was a steam locomotive pulled straight out of centuries long gone. Sound returned just as suddenly as it had disappeared, as the engine released a piercing whistle, every gold fitting and trim rattling in anticipation of movement. And then we were surrounded by noise: chugging motors, shaking nuts, roaring boilers, hissing steam, gurgling smoke. A din all around us, suffocating every thought, every impulse except the conductor’s voice.

“Come, she’s raring to go!” he called, gesturing at the first compartment on the train, right behind the engine, almost pitch-black with some grey mixed in, along with golden patterns of branches and leaves.

“Wait, we don’t have a ticket!” I shouted over the noise, though I suspected he would have no trouble hearing. “You don’t even know where we’re going!”

“Chhayagarh to Malda!” he shouted back, grin ever-present as he tapped his hat. “I have it all here. The formalities are taken care of, sirs. Just take your seats, and we’ll be off!”

“*Baba*.” I looked helplessly at my father.

He looked as afraid as I was, but the sight of my face seemed to give him strength. “We’ve changed our minds, conductor. We’re not taking the train after all. Apologies for the trouble.”

“Oh?” He sounded almost concerned. “Has there been any deficiency in my service? I do apologize, I’m just nervous, you see. We’ve not had high-profile passengers in such a long time, and—”

“That’s not it,” my father said. I could tell he was fighting to keep his voice neutral. “We’ve just decided that… well, that we’d… enjoy the journey by road instead. So, we’ll take your leave. Please.”

He added the ‘please’ in an almost pleading whisper.

The conductor remained frozen for a moment. Not like a human, but like a doll whose batteries had been removed. Then he jerked to life again, smiling broadly. “Not a problem, sir.”

We both perked up. “No?”

“Of course not! One cannot, after all, force guests onboard! That would be terribly impolite. But…” He fidgeted.

My heart dropped into the pit of my stomach, that same sixth sense tingling again. “But?”

“Well, if it was just me, no problem! But, you see, the engine is quite irritated at our delay here. Every second lost is a cost, all that. You know the drill. As passengers, you are protected, but if you cancel your ticket…”

Slowly, we looked up at the engine. It was shifting, every golden knob and bolt gliding along its metal body like water. Fixing themselves on us like scores of insectoid eyes. Its whistle sounded once more, lower and quieter now. Sinister. It stopped smoking, as if holding its breath.

Then, I thought I saw the whole locomotive shift against its carriage, grinding and scraping. Like massive jaws.

Too late, I noticed something: the entire body of the train was slowly pulsing, almost too subtly to be visible. Every fitting stretched apart glacially, then collapsed with a wet clanking. A wave propagating down its body.

It was a disorienting feeling, like watching a gigantic slug made of coal and metal rather than flesh and slime. A pulse? A breath? A digestive tract?

“The exit is right back the way you came,” the conductor helpfully whispered, as if he did not want the train to hear, “but if you move, it will give chase, so try and run fast. I hate all the… sounds.”

The image of that massive train lifting itself off its track danced before my eyes, unfurling into a roaring nightmare, screaming after us. Running us over. Feasting.

My legs quivered in place, unable to decide which way to move. Whether to move at all. My father continued to pray under his breath, studiously avoiding my gaze.

“We must make a choice, sirs.” The conductor was calm, like he was talking to children. “The train absolutely cannot wait forever.”

Just for a moment, train tracks red with gore and clotting streaks flashed before my eyes. I glanced at my father. He was still praying. So, I made the choice.

“We’ll board.”

“Splendid choice!” He smiled, gesturing at the door.

As we grasped the handles and hoisted ourselves into the compartment, I swore I heard the train sigh around me, the metal shuddering with organic wetness as it felt us inside. Every surface was moving, ever so slightly: the floor breathed under me, the walls pulsated, and the comfortable wood-and-plush seats undulated like a broken carousel. Every single one was occupied by people. People whom I realised I had seen at the station before: passengers, hawkers, vendors, staff, even a few beggars who hung around the place. At the back of the carriage, a door with a clear glass screen showed the next compartment, similarly filled.

The conductor was right. Everyone had boarded, now as one in a deep, unshakeable slumber as the train moved and breathed around them.

“There’s you!” The conductor pointed at the two foremost seats of the carriage, set slightly apart from the rest. These, I noted, were relatively still compared to the rest of the train.

If I looked only at them, I could half-pretend that everything was completely normal. So, I did, gently guiding my father over and taking our seats. I tried to look out the window. It fogged over.

As if something massive had exhaled on it.

“And here’s me!” He plopped himself down on a smaller bench set into the wall, directly in front of us. “Best seats in the house, for the best people on the train! Anyway, we’re ready now, so hold on! She runs like the wind!”

He rapped his knuckles sharply against the wood-panelled interior, thrice. I heard a piercing whistle from the engine, and then with a great lugging and chugging, we began to move. The wheels hissed and clattered against the rails as we built up speed. Far faster than an engine so archaic should go. The frosting on my window thickened further, the scenery disappearing into a stir of mist that turned into thick fog. There were no turns, no curves. The train just barrelled on, straight ahead, almost as if forging its own tracks.

Then, it began to change. It took a great shuddering breath, the components separating all around us. Wall panels broke apart to show pink flesh underneath. The metal floor cracked into segments, veiny grey lumps poking out from between them. The seats around us began to crack, leaking pale red fluid that covered their occupants. Ours remained intact for the most part, though I could feel something wet against the leg of my pants.

I felt my father grip my hand tightly, and though I did not have the courage to look at him, I gripped it right back, keeping my eyes on the conductor’s steady grin. Strange fleshy projections began to descend from the ceiling like tongues, lolling and jerking as the lights flickered.

Then they died altogether, and in the darkness, the front of the train began to rise. The sound of the wheels grew infrequent and then disappeared. There was a terrible tearing sound, like metal folding and bending. Then we sped up further, the clattering fading into regular, heavy thumps that shook the train around us. I made the mistake of curiously looking at the window.

Through the frosted glass, I saw it: pink, fleshy, and massive, turning in circles that seemed at once too slow and too fast. A gigantic, skinless limb, all taut, pink, bloody muscle, as it dug into the ground and threw us forward at breakneck speed. More rhythmic thumps behind us: more limbs, grabbing and propelling in a rhythmic dance.

The train… it was running.

“Told you, didn’t I?” the conductor shouted over the din of creaking metal, as if reading my mind, “She runs like the wind!”

The other passengers remained in their stupor even as the train shifted around them, growing wetter, fleshier by the second. All I could do was hold on tight to my seat and to my father, eyes refusing to even close to spare me the horror.

How long had we been moving? Seconds? Hours? Days? Eternities? Time lost all meaning in this foggy twilight, only the white teeth of the conductor keeping us company, reassuring us we were still alive.

“We’ll be there before you know it, trust me.” The conductor leaned back in his seat, apparently immune to the horrors unfolding around him. “You know, when we made the Chhayagarh deal with your lord, we thought we had a bargain! Spanking new station! Exclusive carriage rights! The profits were incredible! And all we had to give in return were a few VIP seats. Get you folk from point A to point B intact, immune from the… usual fare. Then, we show up, first day, festooned with banners and welcomes, and the station’s empty!”

He made a poofing gesture. “The next day, gone! Someone shut the damn place down! Can you believe the nerve? You people haven’t shown up on a single station since, and we’ve been to them all. Running laps round and round, searching for a single passenger from Chhayagarh. One! Haven’t we, girl?”

The train responded with a deep, keening groan, components whining like a starving dog. The compartment shuddered and breathed around us, and the legs continued their relentless routine outside.

“Do you know what went wrong?” Even through his hat, I could feel his gaze boring into me.

My father and I exchanged sidelong glances before shaking our heads simultaneously.

“We don’t know anything,” he said softly. “Please, you must believe us.”

The conductor grinned again. “Relax! Whatever happened, you’re here now, and we’re just raring to serve!” He checked his watch again. The snicking of the lid had a certain finality to it, like a coffin being sealed. “Speaking of which, it’s almost feeding time.”

“Feeding… time?” I stuttered.

“Running on time takes a lot of juice, you know. Coal just won’t cut it!” He nodded at something behind us.

A wet, slurping noise.

Our hands slipped apart in horror as, provoked by the sound of the watch, the tongues of the train danced to life, descending upon the passengers.

Their seats morphed, cushions mutating into balloons of flesh that wriggled as they swelled around their limp bodies. The tongues grew longer, stiffening like massive needles. And then they jerked in lightning-fast motion, falling as one onto the crown of their heads. It was less than a second of contact, barely visible to the naked eye, as each tongue pierced straight through the skull with a brief, soggy crack, pulsing as it injected something. For a moment, nothing happened.

Then, all at once, skin began to break into blisters, and then sagged as the underlying flesh melted into slag. A pinkish, reddish fluid began to pour out of the rapidly deflating bodies of the passengers, streaming from every orifice. It flowed from collapsing ears, from popping eyes, from nailbeds rapidly peeling off, as organs were digested from the inside out. The skin flopped uselessly, a sack to hold the nourishing feed of the train. Then the seats rose up around them, a massive flesh mattress that enveloped them.

They began to suck and chew, hardening into plates as they ground their contents and then gulped them down into the hellish gullet of the machine. The legs outside renewed their beating vigour, energized by the meal. Before our very eyes, the seats returned to their original shape, regrowing veneers of fluff and wood as tongues withdrew into flaccidity once more. The compartment was empty now, save, of course, us. The VIPs, as he said. Then there was more chewing and grinding.

The compartment behind us was feeding. Then, I guessed, the next, and the next.

Poured into the roaring flames that fuelled our nightmare. An industrial python, feeding in terrible, undulating rhythm.

“Never gets old, does it?” The conductor was nearly bouncing with excitement, as if he’d surprised me with a ticket to Disney World.

My father was slack-jawed next to me, even prayer slipping from his lips now as his eyes stared beyond everything. Their depths turned glassy, his brain turning the lights out to help him cope. I was given no such mercy, watching helplessly as the train swelled, baring more and more of its pink innards, evidently satisfied by the meal. The bag had slipped from my grasp, falling onto the floor. Now, as the floorboards retreated from each other, it threatened to fall into one of the maw-like holes. Acting more out of instinct than anything else, I lunged and yanked it free, a millisecond before the gap snapped shut.

I couldn’t lose my admit card. Not after all the trouble.

“Careful about your luggage, it can be quite peckish when it wants—” For the first time, the conductor’s voice trailed off, uncertainty entering his tone. He was, I noticed, looking straight up.

“Oh, no,” he breathed. “Oh, boy.”

I looked up, just in time to see a tentacle descending, its stiffening tip aimed straight for me.

“No, down, girl! That wasn’t the deal!”

The train stabbed down. My body moved before I could think, throwing my weight to the side, avoiding the lethal injection by an instant. Its side smashed into my shoulder. Bone snapped like twigs.

Then, the seat was there, growing, swelling around me. I tried to claw myself out, but its sides were slick with juices, mucosal and slippery. Clinging and pulling me down with them. My hand could not get a grip, and I only slipped deeper, watching the world outside fade as I was sealed in a terrible, squelching embrace.

It began to chew, thrashing me around from side to side as the gap began to fill with a pungent liquid, a bubbling bile that left me red and raw where it touched. The walls around me began to thicken, gaining rough ridges designed to rend flesh from bone. The motions of my disgusting capsule slammed me into them again and again, flaying and tearing.

Pain was a word that lost all meaning for me. My mind finally decided I had had enough, sealing my thoughts in a warm bed of nothingness as my body was ravaged. I floated in a comforting world, devoid of any sensation, only dimly aware of being eaten. Perhaps for the best. I’m not sure I would still be sane if that experience had been mine in full.

Eventually, that nothingness, too, began to fade. I saw our house, the wooden dinner table wiped clean, more pristine than it had ever been. I saw my mother. She extended her arm to me.

She was holding a glass.

Black milk sloshed inside, glittering like obsidian. I reached out to take it.

Then, hands on my wrists. Something, someone, was pulling at me. I was jolted back to life, and pain was there, lancing into every tortured, half-eaten fibre of my being. I screamed into the fiery digestive around me, grabbing onto my saviour like a man possessed. And I was pulled, slowly, torturously, out of the horrifically maternal embrace of the pseudo-sac, unwilling to relinquish me.

When my senses returned, I was vomiting black liquid onto the floor, shivering in a foetal position. Above me was my father, eyes wild as he stared down at me, one slimy hand free of the seat-chamber. The other, still partway inside. Behind him, the conductor was standing like a statue, his grin melted away, unwilling to help. Or maybe unable.

I opened my mouth to speak, to warn him to pull himself free. The sack clamped down on his arm and began to chew.

He began to scream.

Time passed in flashes. I was on my feet, heedless of my own condition, pulling. The arm was stuck in a vice grip that I had no chance of breaking. I pulled harder. Harder, and harder, and harder.

The conductor was shouting, but his words barely reached my ears. I kept pulling. Something began to give way, like the roots of an ancient tree, tilting, breaking free in a violent storm.

Then, there was a pop. A terribly loud and clear one. And resistance disappeared.

I crashed to the floor, my father limp and heavy on top of me as I tried to hold both him and myself up. Everything below his left shoulder was now gone, the stump rapidly sizzling and clotting under the effects of the train’s digestive juices. There was no blood. I could almost pretend he was uninjured, with the way he refused to cry or scream. He only stared, first at the stump and then at the mouth, still chewing.

“No, no, no!” The conductor stomped over and stuck his hand into the still-chewing mouth, fearlessly fishing around inside while fixing his eyes on us. “This wasn’t how it was supposed to go! What a fucking disaster!”

My father had stopped bleeding entirely, the last few trickles disappearing behind a massive, discoloured plug. He looked at me, expression still blank, and though I couldn’t know how much pain he was in, there was something different in his eyes. Like he had left more than an arm behind in there.

“We had a deal! A deal!” With another disgusting pop, the conductor pulled the half-eaten, mangled arm free. His own coat was sizzling, but he barely seemed to care, turning the arm around like someone who had broken an expensive item in a museum. “Oh, no. Oh, no. Humans need their limbs. Their limbs! They’re important! Do you want this back?”

He offered me the lump of flesh that was once allegedly an arm. “Of course you do. You can put it back, right? Can humans do that with limbs? Oh, lord, it’s been so long since we’ve had an accident!”

The train rumbled something in a language only they shared.

“No, that’s not what we said!” The conductor stamped his feet, dropping all pretence of professionalism, for all the good it had done us. “She’s not usually like this, I swear! She’ll be good from now on! Please don’t file a complaint about this! The deal may fall through!”

I heard his words, but I barely listened, staring only at the lump of flesh he was still holding out. It was still twitching somehow. The mangled remains of what were once fingers, still moving. How were there six of them?

Why was one of them so long?

Around us, the train began to slow. The ceaseless beating of its legs slowed and then began to fade away. The front tilted back down, wheels landing back on tracks with a sharp jerk of friction. Iron and gold closed once more over flesh, the horror sealed behind the mundane in the glow of restored lights. Only we remained as the evidence, crouching before our “VIP seats”, the Conductor paralysed with uncertainty over us.

The window was clearing up. Outside, a station like any other, people bustling in a sea of bodies. A painted wall passed us by.

Malda Town Railway Station.

“Here we are,” the conductor breathed, his tone regaining some of its neutrality. “Our destination. I hope this one terrible experience will not erase the effects of what was otherwise surely a fabulous ride?”

When I did not answer, he checked his watch again. “Right on time, too. Just as expected, with two hours to spare before your exam.”

The exam I had told him nothing about.

“In fact…” The Conductor raised a finger and disappeared into the engine, leaving us to recover on the floor.

I looked at my father, eyes welling with tears for the first time.

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” was all I could whisper, over and over, like it would bring back whatever he lost in there.

He said nothing, only tapping my cheek with his remaining hand.

“There.” The conductor returned, having discarded the remains of his arm somewhere. In his hands was an entirely new one, uncannily matching my father’s skin tone and body size. “You should count yourself lucky. We just happened to have a good match in storage.”

“A… match?”

“It’s fresh,” he offered helpfully. “Just get to a doctor within the day. A good one, and he’ll be able to reattach it. Don’t worry about the cost. We’ll ensure it gets comped. Consider it compensation for the absolutely terrible time we’ve given you today.”

He bowed, actually bowed, extending the arm to me like a trophy.

What did I do?

Deboarding was a blur, tea sellers hawking and children playing as if they could not see an armless man and his son staggering around in half-melted clothes. I admitted my father to the hospital, along with a convenient arm and an even more convenient story.  Then, I washed my face, bought a new shirt, and went for my exam.

Because, where I’m from, you see shit. And then life goes on.

All things considered, it went pretty well. I don’t remember much of the questions. Only that my invigilator was greatly appreciative of my punctuality.

We’re both alive, will soon be mostly intact, and I’ll probably be getting into my college.

My father had somehow already regained consciousness when I met him in recovery.

I did not question why the surgeon who updated me after his surgery was very different from the one who had wheeled him in before it.

I did not question why, despite the rest of his immaculate surgical scrubs, he had a perfectly perched top hat on his head that cast his face into shadow.

I did not question why he did not present me with a bill.

It looks like the conductor’s promise held up this time.

My father’s starting to talk again, but only very briefly. A few words, nothing more.

There’s only one thing he says with perfect clarity for now. Again, and again. And honestly, I agree.
