I should have known something was wrong the moment I saw the ad.  

“Night Clerk Wanted. No Experience Necessary. High Pay. Cash Only.”  

That last part stood out. Nobody pays in cash anymore, and definitely not at the rate they were offering—three times what a normal graveyard shift job would pay. But I was desperate. Rent was overdue, my car was on the verge of breaking down, and my fridge was as empty as my bank account.  

The motel sat on the outskirts of town, a crumbling relic from the 70s, barely visible from the highway. The neon sign flickered erratically, buzzing like a dying insect. Moonlight Motel, it read, though half the letters were burnt out. “Moonlight Motel.” It looked abandoned, but as I pulled into the cracked parking lot, I saw a single light glowing from the office window.  

Inside, the air was thick with the stench of mildew and something else—something metallic, like rust or blood. Behind the desk sat a man who looked like he hadn’t slept in years. His skin was pale, almost translucent under the flickering fluorescent lights, and his eyes were sunken, shadowed by deep circles.  

“You here for the job?” His voice was flat, emotionless.  

I hesitated before nodding. He pushed a set of keys across the desk. “You start tonight.”  

“No interview?” I asked.  

“Not necessary.”  

I should have walked out right then. But the weight of my empty wallet kept me rooted to the spot. I swallowed my unease. “Any rules?”  

The man’s gaze darkened. His lips barely moved as he spoke:  

“Never question the guests.”  

A chill crawled up my spine. I wanted to ask what he meant, but something in his expression told me I wouldn’t like the answer. Instead, I nodded, took the keys, and stepped behind the counter.  

The man stood up and grabbed his coat. “I’ll be back at dawn. Don’t leave the office. Don’t talk too much. And whatever you see on the cameras… ignore it.”  

Before I could respond, he was gone, leaving me alone in the dim, humming silence of the Moonlight Motel.  

And that was the beginning of the longest night of my life.  

At first, the shift was quiet. Too quiet.  

The only sound was the steady ticking of the old wall clock and the occasional gust of wind rattling the windows. I busied myself organizing the scattered papers on the desk, trying to ignore the peeling wallpaper and the faint smell of something rotten wafting from the vents.  

The guest log sat open in front of me. I flipped through the pages. Something was off.  

The names were… strange. Some were illegible, written in symbols I didn’t recognize. Others were just initials, or single words like Mr. White or Mother. And then there were the dates. The most recent check-in was three days ago. No check-outs. Before that? A week. Two weeks. A month. Pages and pages of guests arriving, but never leaving.  

A shiver crept up my spine.  

The bell above the office door jingled, and I nearly jumped out of my chair.  

A man stood in the doorway. At least, I thought it was a man. His face was… wrong. Something about the way the shadows fell across it made it seem like his features were shifting, like his mouth and nose weren’t quite where they should be. His suit was too clean, too crisp, like it had just been ironed moments before.  

He didn’t blink.  

“I need a room,” he said.  

His voice didn’t match his lips. There was a lag, like a badly dubbed movie. I forced a smile, pretending not to notice. “Sure. Uh, how many nights?”  

He tilted his head slightly. “Just the one.”  

A lie. I knew that now.  

I handed him a key, trying not to let my fingers touch his as he took it. His skin was ice-cold. Without another word, he turned and walked toward the hallway. His footsteps were… off. Too slow, too deliberate. Like he was mimicking how a person should walk, but not quite getting it right.  

I watched him disappear into the shadows of the motel’s dimly lit corridor.  

I should have ignored the cameras, like the manager said. But I didn’t.  

I turned to the monitor, watching the grainy black-and-white feed of the hallway outside Room 6, where the man had just gone. He stood in front of the door, motionless. Seconds passed. Then minutes. He didn’t move.  

Then, all at once, the screen flickered with static.  

And when the image returned—  

The man was staring directly into the camera.  

His face was too close, stretched unnaturally across the screen, as if he knew I was watching.  

And then—  

He smiled.  

Not a normal smile. Not a human smile. It was too wide, stretching from ear to ear, his teeth long and needle-like, gleaming in the flickering light.  

I slammed the monitor off.  

I didn’t sleep at all that night.  

And when dawn came—  

The man was gone. But the key to Room 6 was still on the desk.  

Untouched.  

The second night felt heavier.  

I hadn’t slept after what I saw on the cameras. Even in daylight, the motel felt wrong.

The air was stale, too still, like it hadn’t been disturbed in years. When I arrived for my shift, the manager barely acknowledged me. He sat in the office for a few minutes, staring at the wall, before muttering, “You stayed. Good.”  

Then he left, leaving me alone with whatever the hell was lurking in this place.  

The night started slow. I spent the first few hours flipping through the old guest logs, trying to make sense of the bizarre entries. I found names that had been repeated over and over across different years, decades even. Mr. White. Mother. H. Carter. H. Carter. H. Carter. The same names. The same rooms. But always new dates.  

The wind howled outside. The walls groaned like they were breathing.  

Then, around 2 AM, the noise started.  

A faint scratching—coming from inside the vents.  

At first, I tried to ignore it. Rats, I told myself. Or maybe just the old pipes settling. But the sound grew louder. More deliberate. It wasn’t just random scurrying—it was pacing. A slow, dragging movement, like something was crawling just beneath the surface.  

I turned up the tiny radio on the desk, trying to drown it out.  

That’s when the phone rang.  

The motel phone. The one that had been silent all night.  

I picked it up, hesitant. “Front desk.”  

Static.  

Then, a voice—faint, whispering.  

“Help me.”  

My breath caught in my throat. “Who is this?”  

Silence.  

And then—thump.  

The sound came from inside the vent, just above my head.  

I stumbled back, heart hammering. Dust trickled from the metal grates. Whatever was inside was right there, pressing against the thin barrier. The metal creaked, bending outward slightly, as if something was pushing from the other side.  

I grabbed the flashlight from the desk and aimed it at the vent. “Who’s in there?”  

No answer. Just breathing. Shallow, ragged breathing.  

Then, slowly, something moved.  

A shadow shifted behind the grate. A long, pale hand with fingers too many and too thin slipped through one of the gaps. It twitched, stretching unnaturally, grasping at the air.  

I staggered back. “What the hell”  

BANG!  

The vent dented outward, as if whatever was inside had thrown itself against it. I didn’t wait to see what happened next. I grabbed the office door handle, ready to run—  

But then, just as suddenly as it started, the noise stopped.  

I stood there, frozen, barely breathing. Minutes passed. The air was thick, oppressive. The vent remained still.  

And then—  

The phone rang again.  

I picked it up with a shaking hand.  

Static.  

And then, the voice—closer this time.  

“Don’t look at them.”  

Click.  

The line went dead.  

I nearly quit that night. But when dawn came, the manager returned as if nothing had happened. He didn’t ask why my hands were shaking. Didn’t ask why the vent was dented, or why I had unplugged the security cameras.  

He just dropped an envelope of cash on the desk and said, “See you tonight.”  

And like an idiot, I showed up again.  

The third night felt worse. The motel seemed darker, the air heavier. The lights flickered more than usual. The neon sign outside buzzed like a dying fly, barely illuminating the lot.  

And the guests… they were watching me.  

They didn’t talk, not really. They’d come in, ask for a room in voices that barely sounded human, and disappear into the hall. I avoided eye contact, keeping my head down, pretending not to notice the way their faces shifted when they moved.  

Then, around midnight, she arrived.  

A woman.  

She was different from the others. She looked… normal. Her face didn’t change when I blinked. Her movements were smooth, natural. She had deep, sunken eyes, and her dark hair hung in wet strands over her face, like she had just stepped out of a storm.  

She leaned in close when she spoke. “Please. I need a room.”  

Her voice was hoarse, desperate.  

I hesitated. “How many nights?”  

Her hand clamped over mine. Ice-cold. “Just one.”  

The same lie they all told.  

I gave her the key to Room 9. She didn’t thank me. Didn’t even look at it. She just snatched it from my hand and hurried down the hallway, glancing over her shoulder as if something were following her.  

I watched her on the cameras. Unlike the others, she didn’t just stand in front of her door. She locked it. Bolted it. Pushed the dresser in front of it. Then she sat on the bed, knees pulled to her chest, eyes glued to the door.  

I don’t know why, but I felt compelled to check on her. Maybe because she seemed scared. Maybe because she seemed real.  

I grabbed the master key and made my way down the hall. The motel felt suffocating, like the walls were pressing in. Every door I passed felt wrong, like something was breathing on the other side.  

When I reached Room 9, I knocked softly. “Ma’am? Everything okay?”  

Silence.  

Then, a whisper. “They know I’m here.”  

My stomach twisted. “Who?”  

She didn’t answer. But suddenly, her eyes snapped to something behind me.  

I turned—  

And for the first time, I saw one of them.  

One of the guests.  

Standing at the end of the hall.  

Too tall. Too thin. A silhouette darker than the shadows around it. Its head was tilted too far, its face blank—no eyes, no mouth, just smooth, featureless skin stretched over bone.  

It twitched, taking a jerky step forward.  

The lights flickered.  

And then, another one appeared.  

And another.  

Stepping out of the rooms. Emerging from the darkness.  

Surrounding me.  

The woman in Room 9 grabbed my wrist, yanking me inside just as the lights went out.  

I didn’t fight her. I didn’t question it.  

Because for the first time since I started this job, I knew one thing for certain.  

I was never supposed to leave this motel.  

The woman’s grip was like ice, her nails digging into my skin as she slammed the door shut.  

“Turn off the light,” she hissed.  

I barely had time to react before she reached past me and twisted the lamp’s switch. The room plunged into darkness. My pulse pounded in my ears as we stood there, barely breathing.  

Then, the footsteps started.  

Slow. Uneven. Right outside the door.  

I wanted to move, to hide, to do something—but the woman squeezed my wrist tighter, her silent warning clear: Don’t.  

The floorboards creaked.  

Something was standing outside.  

The doorknob twitched.  

I swallowed hard, forcing myself to stay still. The darkness pressed against me, heavy and suffocating. I could hear it breathing. Or maybe that was the woman. Or maybe it was something else.  

Then, something slid under the door.  

A shadow. Long, stretching across the carpet like fingers, curling toward my feet. I felt a cold, unnatural pull, like it was trying to drag me closer. My breath hitched as I took a tiny step back, but the second I moved, the shadow snapped toward me.  

The woman clamped a hand over my mouth before I could scream. Her voice was barely a whisper.  

“Don’t move. Don’t speak. It can’t see you unless you let it.”  

The shadow twitched. Hesitated.  

And then—  

It retracted.  

The footsteps retreated, slow and deliberate. The door creaked as something leaned against it, its weight pressing against the wood. I could feel it there. Waiting.  

Minutes passed. Maybe hours.  

Then—nothing.  

It was gone.  

The woman finally let go of me, and I sucked in a ragged breath.  

“What the hell was that?” I whispered.  

She didn’t answer at first. She just walked to the window and peeled back the curtain an inch, peering outside.  

Then she whispered two words that made my stomach drop.  

“You saw them.”  

I didn’t respond. I didn’t know how to respond.  

She turned to face me, her sunken eyes full of something like pity. “You shouldn’t have come to this place.”  

“I didn’t have a choice,” I muttered.  

Her expression darkened. “None of us did.”  

Something about the way she said that made my skin crawl.  

I took a shaky breath. “What are they?”  

The woman hesitated. “They don’t have a name. Not one we can say.”  

I shook my head. “That doesn’t make any sense.”  

She ignored me, stepping closer. “How long have you been working here?”  

“Three nights,” I said.  

Her face twisted with something like grief. “That’s too long.”  

My stomach clenched. “What do you mean?”  

She gestured toward the door. “Did you notice? The ones who check in?”  

I nodded slowly. “They don’t leave.”  

“Neither do the employees.”  

The words hit me like a punch to the gut.  

I shook my head. “No. The manager—he leaves every morning.”  

Her lips pressed into a thin line. “Does he?”  

The room felt colder.  

A horrible thought crept into my mind. The manager was always gone when I arrived, always back before dawn. 

I thought about the security cameras. The flickering static. The way some guests just stood in front of their doors, unmoving, staring at nothing.  

The way the motel seemed bigger at night, the hallways stretching longer than they should.  

“What is this place?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.  

She didn’t answer right away. Instead, she reached into her pocket and pulled out something small, pressing it into my hand.  

A room key.  

But not just any key. It was old, rusted, the number worn away. The metal was ice-cold, like it had been sitting in a freezer.  

“What is this?” I asked.  

Her voice was hollow.  

“The key to the real exit.”  

My blood ran cold.  

“There is no front door,” she whispered. “Not really. That thing you walk through every night? It just brings you back in.”  

I wanted to deny it. To argue. But deep down, I felt the truth in her words.  

I gripped the key tighter.  

And then—  

The hallway light flickered.  

The air shifted.  

The woman went pale.  

“They know,” she whispered. “They know I told you.”  

A deep, rattling click echoed from the hallway.  

Like every door was unlocking.  

And then—

The motel came alive.  

The walls groaned, the ceiling trembled. Shadows leaked from under the door. The air was thick with the sound of something moving, countless bodies shifting, twitching, crawling.  

The woman grabbed my arm. “Run.”  

The door burst open—  

And I saw all of them.  

Not just the guests.  

Not just the manager.  

Something else.  

Something that had been waiting for me since the moment I arrived.  

And then—  

The lights went out.  

The lights died.  

Total darkness swallowed the room, thick and suffocating, pressing against my skin like damp earth. I couldn't see my own hands, couldn't tell if my eyes were open or shut. But I felt them.  

The guests.  

Standing in the doorway.  

Waiting.  

A sound crawled through the dark—bones popping, joints twisting, something wet and wrong shifting closer.  

Then—  

A whisper, right next to my ear.  

"Where do you think you're going?"  

Cold breath slid across my neck. I bolted.  

The woman grabbed my wrist, yanking me forward as we ran. I couldn't see, but she seemed to know where to go. My feet pounded against the carpet, the motel warping around us—hallways stretching, doors multiplying, the air thick with the scent of rot and something metallic, like blood.  

The sounds behind us grew louder. Faster. The guests were following, moving with that horrible, jerky twitching like broken marionettes, their too-long limbs scraping against the walls.  

"Where are we going?" I gasped.  

"The stairs," she whispered.  

We turned a corner, and suddenly—there they were. The stairs to the second floor.  

Except—  

There was no second floor.  

I stopped short. "What the hell—?"  

I had seen this motel from the outside. It was one story. No stairs. No upper level.  

But here they were. A long, spiraling staircase, disappearing into the dark above us.  

"Come on!" she hissed, pulling me up the steps. I didn't fight her.  

As we climbed, the motel shifted around us. The walls grew taller, the air colder. The fluorescent lights flickered, casting shadows that moved on their own.  

A voice slithered through the dark.  

"You don't belong here."  

It was everywhere. Behind us. Above us. Inside my own head.  

Then—  

A hand shot out from between the steps.  

Thin. Grey. Fingers too long, clawing at my ankle.  

I kicked—hard. The thing screeched, a high, warbling sound like a skipping record. The woman yanked me up the last few steps, and suddenly—  

We weren’t in the motel anymore.  

We were somewhere else.  

The air changed the second we stepped off the stairs. It was wrong. Heavy.  

We stood in a narrow hallway lined with doors. Hundreds of them. More than the motel could possibly hold. They stretched endlessly in both directions, each door identical—wooden, numbered in brass.  

"This isn't real," I whispered.  

The woman ignored me, marching forward with quick, purposeful steps. "Stay close. Don’t touch the doors."  

I followed, my heart hammering. The hallway was dead silent except for our footsteps, but I could feel something behind the doors. Watching. Listening.  

Then, as we passed Room 209—  

Knuckles rapped against the wood.  

I froze.  

The woman grabbed my arm, yanking me forward. "Don’t stop."  

Another door knocked. Then another. The sound spread like a wave, growing faster, more frantic, dozens—no, hundreds—of fists hammering against the wood.  

BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG!  

The hallway shook. The doors rattled in their frames.  

And then—  

One swung open.  

A long, pale arm shot out, fingers grasping, nails splintering as they dug into the floor. The rest of it followed—a thing, crawling out on too many limbs, its head lolling, mouth yawning open in a soundless scream.  

We ran.  

The hallway stretched, growing longer, the doors warping and pulsing like breathing flesh. The lights flickered wildly, casting grotesque, shifting shadows that didn't match our movements.  

Something was chasing us. I didn't dare look back.  

Then—  

The woman stopped.  

I skidded to a halt beside her. "What the hell are you doing?! Keep moving!"  

She didn’t respond. She was staring at a door. Different from the others.  

Black. No number. No handle.  

"The exit," she breathed.  

I didn’t ask questions. I reached for the key she had given me earlier, shoved it into the lock, and twisted.  

The door screamed.  

Not a creak. Not a groan. A full, shrieking wail, as if the wood itself was alive. The air turned ice-cold. The motel shuddered, the hallway collapsing inward—  

And then—  

The door swung open.  

And on the other side—  

There was nothing.  

A black void, stretching endlessly. Cold air pulled at me, dragging me toward it like a gaping mouth ready to swallow me whole.  

The woman grabbed my wrist. "This is the only way out."  

I stared into the darkness. My stomach twisted with a primal, gut-wrenching fear.  

Something waited in that void.  

Something worse than the guests.  

The hallway behind us collapsed, doors crumbling into the
