Drip.

Precious time was slipping away, but none of us found the will to stand. Maria sat, still weeping for Julian. Mark’s eyes never wavered from the cold corridor from which we’d narrowly escaped advanced research. Savannah paced wildly, her breath frantic. I couldn’t tell if the muttering under her breath was fueled with anger or fear.

Drip.

The voice over the intercom had died out. Whoever was on the other end must have seen from the camera in the junction that we had ignored its panicked rambling since we’d arrived back at the intersection. 

Drip.

Savannah paused her pacing, eyes locked on the steady drip that intermittently dropped from the ceiling above. “Would someone PLEASE put a towel or a shirt or something on the floor? It’s too loud in here, I need… I need to think.”

I rolled my eyes and pulled a rolled t-shirt under my bag, throwing it on the floor where the drips were landing. She wasn’t wrong though- in the silence left in the absence of conversation, the steady drip was deafening. It screamed into our ears, blasting the truth we’d been ignoring loud and clear. “You are underwater. You are not safe here.”

Maria wiped her tears, and stood up suddenly.

“I know you saw that too, Eli. He was alive back there, he was back on the ledge. I’m going to get him.”

I sat back against the cold metal. “He was back yeah, but so are you. We’re not going only for one of us to die again.”

Mark tilted his head, his eyes finally leaving the hallway to look at me. “What do you two mean ‘he’s back’? And I hat do you mean she’s back too?”

Exasperated, I let my head sink back, hitting the iron behind me. “When she got taken first, dumbass. When the that thing came and grabbed her first, took her down. Something… something reset, and she was back between you two. It reached up and grabbed Julian instead that time. When we were closing the door it happens again, and Julian was on the platform alone.”

Mark gawked at me like I had two heads. “What are you talking about dude? Nothing ever came and grabbed Maria, it just got Jule.”

Savannah’s face scrunched. “Mark, there’s no way you didn’t see it, she was right in front of you when she got taken. You and Julian tried grabbing her. By the time we ran over to you, she was back again.”

Mark and Maria exchanged a dumbstruck glance, and Maria stood up. “That… that didn’t happen. I just remember you running up to Jule screaming that you’d kill him, and he pushed me out of the way before it took him.” Her eyes focused, fear immediately washing her face. “Wait, you’re saying that… that like Julian came back, that happened to me too?”

“Yeah. You really don’t remember? At all?”

Maria stood silent for a moment, eyes on the floor and mouth moving but too shocked to speak. 

Savannah sighed, exasperated. “So what now? Eli’s right, there’s now way I’m going back to research, but we still have…” she checked her watch. “Seven hours until it’s too late to return to the surface in time.”

Mark’s eyes locked onto her. “You want us to stay down here? Are you kidding me? Hell no, we don’t know what else is waiting down here for us. Your watch is busted, by the way, we only have FIVE hours left. Are we even going to acknowledge the TREE-SIZED TENTACLE that just crushed Maria’s boyfriend to death? That…. Thing down there, it shouldn’t exist. We need to get out of here, now.”

“And just leave whoever is stuck down here alone to die? The voice sounded scared, Mark. We came down here to help, so we need to help.”

“And risk ending up like Julian?”

Maria turned to Mark, fury in her teary eyes. “You coward! You’d let him come down here and die for nothing? If whoever it is that’s stuck down here knows how this place works, he’d be able to.. to reset the loop again, and bring him back. We need to keep going, we have to!”

Mark put his head in his hand. “And if you’re wrong? If the guy on the intercom decides he doesn’t want to play nice?”

“Then we tried.”

We sat in silence for a while longer. Savannah resumed her pacing as Maria began to gather herself and prepare to continue. Mark sat, fuming in the corner.

After a while, the speaker buzzed to life once again. “Please… please hurry. I’m so sorry about your friend, I tried to warn you as best as I could. I tried warning you. My equipment, it’s not… I’m running out of time. The water is up to my waist in here, I won’t be able to use the intercom for much longer. And stick together this time, all of you.”

Mark was on his feet faster than I thought he could move. He stood in front of the speaker, and screamed at it. “Who the FUCK are you? One of us just died because of you, and we don’t even know if you were worth it. I need answers, now!”

Savannah gently walked up behind him, placing her hand on his back. “He can’t hear us, babe.”

Mark pushed her hand away, and stormed up to the small camera on the other wall. He raised his hand to it, his middle finger raised in a message that the voice was sure to receive.

The intercom buzzed to life again. “I know, I know. I’m trying here, I promise, but unless you come get me, Julian will be gone forever.”

Maria bolted to her feet. “How did he know Julian’s name?” She ran over to the camera, shoving Mark out of the way. She screamed the words as loud as possible, moving her mouth in an attempt for the voice to read her lips. “HOW DID YOU KNOW HIS NAME!?”

The speaker laid silent for several long seconds, before the speaker sighed. 

“Sublevel maintenance, Maria. I’m in sublevel maintenance. Please save me, then we’ll talk.”

Maria didn’t hesitate for a second and darted off, flashlight in hand, on the path towards our left.

Savannah, already standing, took off after her, and it took me a second to stand as I began to chase her too.
Mark stopped me, grabbing me by the arm as I moved to enter the dim maintenance hall.

“We don’t have time for this, we have less than five hours until it’s too late to return to the surface.”

“Let me go, Mark! I have to go get my sister. And we have seven hours, not five.”

Mark loosened his grip on my arm. “Not by my watch. Go get them, and be back here in less than fifteen minutes. There’s nothing good waiting down that hall, I promise you. I’ll be here waiting, but I’ll be damned if I let anything back through that isn’t you three.”

He released me, and I followed Savannah and Maria into the dark. I winced as I heard the bulkhead door separating the hall from the junction swing close behind me. I turned to see Mark look at me through the small window in the door. He pulled up his wrist, and mouthed “fifteen minutes”. 

Maintenance was structured very similarly to the research wing. One long central hall seemed to be the through-line from which many branching rooms and halls spread. It didn’t take long at all for me to catch up to Savannah, who herself had caught up with and stopped Maria, who was begging to continue towards the voice.

“No, please, you don’t understand, he can help Julian. Whatever’s going on here he can help us, he can help! I need to get to him, please let me go!”

I paused to look around. On a wall nearby, a camera sat pointed at us, a speaker directly adjacent. I walked over to the camera gestured with my hands, spreading them apart and shrugging my shoulders as I mouthed the words “how far?”

The intercom buzzed to life. “Not very. If you hurry, there’s a door marked ‘Primary pump delta’ a bit further, I’m down there, about two levels down.”

I walked back over to the girls. “Hear that, he’s close. Mark wants us back at the junction in ten minutes though, and I think it’ll take a little longer than that. Savannah, can you go back to him and let him know we we’ll need a little more time but we’ll be there soon?

She nodded, and began to turn back before pulling Maria in for a hug. “We’ll try to bring him back, girl. We’ll try.”

My sister nodded, then took off. Before Savannah had even started walking away, Maria was sprinting down the dimly lit hall toward the stairwell labeled Primary Pump Delta.

I cursed under my breath, taking off after her. The walls down here were even worse than the ones in research. Creaking metal encased us, rust creeping like veins along the welded seams. The flickering lights overhead barely made a difference against the thick darkness, and the distant grumble of machinery filled the air like a heaving breath.

“Maria, slow the hell down!” I hissed, to no avail. 

The intercom crackled again as we ran. “Almost there end of the hall, door on the right. I’ve lost camera coverage of you guys but the good news is there should be service microphones up ahead. Let me know when you find the door marked ‘triple bypass’.”

We reached the bottom of the stairs in less than a minute. The words “PRIMARY PUMP DELTA- SUBLEVEL 02” were emblazoned on the heavy steel bulkhead in flaking white paint. Below, a bright red logo was stamped on the door, a familiar “WHG”. My stomach knotted. What did a pharmaceutical company like the Whitlam-Hawthorne group have to do with any of this?

Maria didn’t hesitate. She grasped the large manual valve on the door and twisted with as much force as she could muster. It groaned, scraping against rusted metal, before giving way with a mechanical hiss. 

The door opened, and cold, damp air rushed out to meet us. The room ahead was tighter than the corridors behind, filled with tangled pipes and thick cables, moisture dripping off of every available surface. At the opposite end, a grated metal floor descended downward, forming another tight stairwell. Beyond it, darkness.

We descended once more, and a sign above our heads read “SUBLEVEL 03”. The walls were lined with old monitors, some still displaying static-drenched data. I walked over to the nearest one still displaying readable text, but the words on it made no sense to me. 

“Temporal Phenomena – Recurrence Threshold 94% - Displacement Stabilization Incomplete – Please Report Anomalies. Containment Field Bypass Requires Triple Synchronization. Onsite Subject 00-Delta, “Pe’Cuul Sov-Cana” Status: Stasis Suspended”

Maria startled me as she spoke behind me, also staring at the monitor. “What… the hell is this?”

I had no answer. Somewhere deeper, machinery groaned, rattling the floor beneath our feet.

“We need to get out of here.” I said. “Now.”

Maria shook her head. “No. This place - ‘temporal phenomena’, that means time right? Like, we could go back and save Julian?”

She stepped forward, peering down the next set of stairs. I clenched my jaw and followed.

We emerged into a small chamber. More than before, tiled in steel. At the far end, a locked door, thick and reinforced. A heavy pressure-sealed vault.

A red panel sat beside it, three large valves mounted to the wall.

Maria frowned. “This must be the triple bypass he mentioned, right?”

The intercom buzzed to life. Next to it, a microphone grill sat blinking with red light. 

“You’re here. Good. The only way to open that door is to turn all three valves at the same time. It’s a failsafe for keeping things out of here.”

I exchanged a glance with Maria. “There’s only two of us.”

Silence. Then, static. A heavy, trembling breath.

“…Only two?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Savannah went back for Mark.”

The voice shattered.

“Oh my God. No. NO. I told you, I told you EXPLICITLY NOT to split up! Get back upstairs, GO NOW.”

Maria flinched, eyes wide. “What? What’s wrong?!”

“She’s NOT SAFE. NONE OF YOU ARE SAFE. This can’t be happening, not again. HURRY!”

I didn’t wait. I grabbed Maria by the wrist and ran.

Within five minutes we were back at the door that sealed off sublevel maintenance from the junction we’d been waiting in. 

I slammed through the cracked bulkhead door into the main intersection, panting.

Empty. Mark was gone, Savannah was gone.

Maria skidded to a halted stop beside me, panic creeping into her voice. “Where.. where are they? They didn’t leave us, right?”

As if in response, a pained wail echoed through the hallway to our right; a raw, guttural sound that echoed down the corridor—the hall leading back to the Lander.

Savannah.

Maria and I bolted toward the sound.

The long corridor leading back to where we’d arrived stretched longer than I remembered. My own breathing was deafening in my ears. The wailing grew louder.

We reached the end of the corridor, and in the dim light Savannah sat hunched up ahead. She was on her knees, sobbing hysterically, clutching something on the ground.

I felt my stomach drop.

No.

The body was hollowed and dry. A husked skeleton, its flesh dried and clinging to brittle bones, its skull tilted unnaturally, its clothes unmistakable.

Mark’s clothes. Mark’s backpack. Mark’s boots.

Maria screamed.

Savannah collapsed against the wall, gasping between sobs. “He was—he was just here, he was JUST—”

Maria’s hands trembled. “No, no, he—”

I backed up, breath catching in my throat, my pulse roaring in my ears.

I reached my hand out to brace myself against the wall, and rough marks scratched the palm of my hand. I looked at the wall next to me, and stepped back in shock as dozens of tally marks sat scratched into the surrounding panels. 

Next to the tallies, scratched large into the wall, were the words “I waited for days. You never came back.” The scratched were rusted over, as if they’d been made decades ago.
