I think my Uncle’s a fish.

Hey all. my name's Tanner Greene, and a lot of weird shit has been happening around me. I’m writing this in the loft of my aunt's beachside shop where she insists I live while I’m over here, and I just need to vent cus I feel like I’m insane.

So I’m 22… I’m originally from San Jose California, and until about a week ago I was living at my dads house. My dads a great guy, but he’s been really pushy about me moving out… which I guess is reasonable given my current prospects; I’m a college Dropout, I just lost my previous job because I refused to work dishpit as a busser, my car is one bad day away from a blown Gasket and I have no savings to replace it. 

Losing my job must’ve been the final straw because my dad, very shakily, suggested I move up to Oregon for the year. His sister, my aunt runs a Beach Souvenir shop in Happy Harbor Oregon, it’s a small town on the coast between Depot Bay and Newport, we’re not one of the more popular beach spots but we get a fair amount of business with our annual end of summer parade. Anyway, My Aunt Lana was talking with my dad, and his failure of a child must’ve come up. She told him she could give me a job as the off-season shop clerk, after all beach shops still stay open after summer. The pay would be 12 per hour, a little under minimum wage, and she would even give me the loft of the shop to live in.

The reason this news came to me shakily is because of me and my dads history with Happy Harbor. When I was younger my family would go up to Happy Harbor for the summer season and stay with my Aunt Lana, but when I was 6 my mother committed a murder suicide by convincing me, and my sister, we were in danger from something I can’t recall the name of, and that my Aunt was gonna kill her… she ran the two of us into the ocean, I remember the cold Oregon water envelop us like a cold hand driving us under. I don’t know how but I guess I realized this was wrong and I kicked my way out of my moms grasp as she clawed at me to keep me under, my adrenaline beat her dying claws to my back and I ended up making it back to the beach somehow… Me and my dad harbor a lot of survivors guilt over the incident, and I had to go through a lot of therapy in my youth to finally start moving past the incident; though my chronic Aquaphobia is a byproduct of this incident.

The conversation was short… and understanding on both ends I understood that my life was drifting nowhere fast, and my dad understood the emotions around that place and was willing to have a conversation with me about it as opposed to just sending me there. I know my dad doesn’t feel this way, but Ive felt like a constant burden on him for a while now, so I jumped at this opportunity regardless of my feelings on the town. We agreed I would leave on 3rd of August and I could come back the following August. My Aunt was ecstatic, she hadn’t seen me in years and to be honest I missed my family over there a fair amount too. 

My Aunt picked me up from San Jose after eating Dominoes with us. She was dressed in a white dress shirt and blue dress pants, she wore bright blue sunglasses and had a Happy Harbor 2025 necklace around her neck. but seeing her again was really strange… to me and my dad, she looked like she hadn’t aged a day, she was allegedly a 50 year old woman, being my dads older sister, and she had clear skin, full deep brown hair, her laugh lines were barely visible and by all accounts she was still a very attractive person. Also she got awfully cagey about removing her sunglasses. My dad said.
“Lana y’know it’s night and we’re inside, you think you still need the glasses.”

And my aunt replied very sternly.
“Mind your business Sam!”

It was a really weird turn in the conversation but oddly after a bit they laughed at each other and kept talking, must be a sibling thing, not like I know. I said goodbye to my dad and began my 12 hour Trek to Happy Harbor with my aunt. I can’t say I got any sleep in the 12 hours we drove due to the incessant questioning my Aunt had for me.

“When did you graduate?”
“Oh uh 2021, right around the pandemic”
“You mean Plandemic” 

I knew immediately the type of year I was in for, for context I’d say I'm left leaning in terms of politics, I'm gender fluid so I naturally drift that way, and my Aunts insistence on referring to me as He/Him even after I corrected her was extremely telling.

“Aunt Lana I hate to be this person but They/Them is generally the pronouns I appreciate if you don’t mind.”

“Haha well we’ll see about that after this year's up ok Buddy!”

I’m not gonna lie for a second, I thought my dad and aunt conspired to send me to a conversion camp after that sentence.

The rest of the conversations drifted between the past 16 years, and general politics in this nightmare of a drive before we finally hit the Oregon Coast, and the sight of the gray beaches and deep blue waves brought a shiver to my spine as I caught myself fixated on the ocean in the car. My Aunt showing her heart in a rare act spoke to me.

“Hey Buddy… look I know you have a history here… we all do. But I’m genuinely happy to have you over here for the year. And if you need to talk or are having like… one of those panic attacks or something… just know we’ll help you out ok.”

I ended up nodding at her and just kept fixating on the ocean, my heart thumping, my breath getting shallow, my pupils dilating and my moms last words, and the sound of screaming underwater flashed through my brain. I reached in my handbag, pulled out my anxiety meds and decided to take one a little early today.

Eventually, we made it to the Harbor, and it was eerily exactly how I remembered it: cloudy skies, old wood shops as far as the eye can see, the look of general dismay of the locals, and finally the huge fishing dock on the east side of the town clearly visible across the ocean. and she parked at the three spot lot right next to her shop… I shook as I realized in a cruel twist of fate, the shop was relocated, and it was now a  beachfront shop that I was expected to live at, “just my luck”. My Aunt must’ve sensed my anxiety and put an unwelcomed arm on my back. 

“Sorry I was figuring out how to tell you.”

“I-eh it’s ok… There’s a pharmacy nearby right?”

“Yeah just a little up towards Newport.”

“Cool, I gotta make a call.”

Call me crazy, but I was planning on trying to get off my anxiety meds with this experience, my therapist told me that confronting the source of my trauma head on could be healthy in confronting and accepting what happened to me in 2009, so I didn’t bother transferring my meds to a new location and just decided to get a refill on my Prozac, and call it good. However I was now gonna be sleeping a brisk walk away from the maw of my deepest fears, so I decided to call the local Safeway and set that back up.

Afterwards my Aunt brought me into the shop, and despite the new location, everything felt agonizingly familiar, if you’ve ever been in a clearly old tourist Knick Knack store you’ll catch my drift, dust in select spots, creaky floorboards, the smell of salt and old wood, blue and white paint the looked more like dyed clay than traditional paint, old stained display cases with “authentic shark teeth” that were made of plastic, endless Happy Harbor merch, like old tee shirts, necklaces, pocket knives, Keychains and so on. My Aunt enthusiastically showed me around the shop as I bore my facade of a smile honestly dreading the full year ahead of me.

She led me to the attic where a twin bed sat next to a large circular window, a window which led straight to the fucking ocean. There were stacks and stacks of overstock boxes. The floorboards were somehow even more creaky than the shop's floorboards, and there was a mindless clinking in the corner of the room as a tin bucket collected water from a leaky ceiling. The loft was, I mean, absurdly cold, 48 degrees as of writing this, and this is where I was meant to stay. My aunt looked at me with an adorable smile as if to say she tried her best and I could only smile back as a deep dread sunk into my chest.

The salt crusted shop bell rang and my Aunt suddenly got giddy.

“Oh my that's your Uncle Leonard! You haven’t met him! Hurry come down!”

She was right, she remarried in 2012 after my former Uncle Danny died, I think it was throat cancer, the thing I remember most about him was the strong smell of cigarettes. Regardless I enthusiastically walked down the stairs of the loft and audibly gasped at what was at the door of the shop, the first thing I noticed about him was his strong smell, it was as if a bag of fish was dragged into a room after being left to rot for days, he was absurdly obese, to the point I was shocked he could walk, his right leg was was swollen, and his right foot was more finned than foot-like, his skin was a leathery off gray with a layer of moisture completely coating his body, his white shirt was transparent due to the moisture revealing large dark areolas. His head was thick with fat, and the closest thing I could compare his face to was the mashed engorged Blobfish image that was spreading around the internet. His eyes were small and black, his “nose” was two holes with a layer of flabby skin that blew upward when he exhaled, his hair was strings of gray that sat on top of His misshapen head, when he breathed his chest made a deep rattling, and when he exhaled a deep bubbly noise emerged from him.

The sight of him must’ve flushed the color out of my face, because My Aunt Stopped and once again grabbed my back and moved down with me as she forced me into a hug with this creature I was meant to call Uncle, his skin was cold, ice cold, and the moisture on his skin was sticky, like mucus, hugging him was like hugging water balloon as his gut swallowed me and my Aunt until I finally could breathe again as I was pulled away. 

“Hey baby”

I heard my aunt say in horror as she leaned up and a second set of smaller lips emerged from my Uncle's lips and kissed her, covering her face in brine.

“This is Tanner, your Nephew!”

His voice emerged from his throat, it was a guttural string of words between deep bubbling grunts.

“Tanner, I’ve heard so much about you.”

His voice nearly made me sick, as I felt my mouth water, I knew I had to try to get along with him, and give a good first impression if I was gonna be allowed to stay here for the year, or survive the night honestly, so I swallowed some spit and replied.

“You too sir”

His grotesque face morphed into a warped smile revealing thin needle-like teeth, akin to an angler fish.

“I hear you're gonna be our new Clerk boy hehehe!”

Gonna sound like a broken record here but his laugh sounded like a drowning man whose final screams were reaching the surface in bubbles.

“Y-yes sir… I’ve been set up in the l-loft…”

“Have you been briefed on the job description”

My aunt chimed in.

“Yes baby, he knows the deal and I left printed instructions on the desk.”

“Hehehe best not pocket from me boy, would hate to confront that fear of yours head on now would we.“

I got sick from that line of thinking as I rushed to the bathroom, it looked like an old bathroom that oddly had a bathtub in it as I threw up into the old stained porcelain toilet. I heard my Aunt and Uncle lightly arguing from the bathroom, I heard something about how he should know better and I eventually heard wet stomps lead up to the door and heard a firm knock on the bathroom.

“Hey son, sorry. That was insensitive of me, I know you have that… anxiety and all that. Come on out and we can all make up.”

His words sounded like a mockery of an apology, and the son certainly didn’t win him any favors. I tried to ground myself and prevent a panic attack. But as I was trying I heard a firmer knock on the door.

“C‘mon now boy! Get on out!” 

His voice made a squelch with that last sentence which caused me to throw up again as I started crying quietly, my chest tightened, my breath quickened, as I heard light footsteps walk up to the door.

“Damnit Baby look what you’ve done!”

“What the hell did I do!”

I heard them begin to argue more before it came to a head.

“Get out of here Leonard, we can try again tomorrow!”

His voice made a vile bubble I took to be a sigh.

“Yeah, Yeah, grow a backbone kid!! I don’t want a lily liveried pussy giving up all my money to the first fella who yells at him!”

“Shut up Leonard! Go ahead and get settled upstairs Tanner, I’ll meet with you tomorrow before you start work. Ok Buddy!”

I pulled myself out of a haze long enough to spout out a couple words.

“Y-yeah good, bye.”

I heard the wet stomps walk away along with the light steps of my aunt and heard them leave the store as the bell rang once again. I laid on the floor and waited my panic attack out, working on my breathing exercises. Eventually I calmed down enough and walked out of the bathroom. I sat down at the clerk chair and rubbed my head for hours trying to rationalize what I saw, maybe it was all a genetic condition, I looked up a variety of skin conditions and diseases and nothing looks nearly like what I saw, I tried looking into inbreeding to see if maybe they were a byproduct some deep inbreeding and once again saw nothing like what I saw in my Uncle Leonard. 

Eventually I locked the shop door and flipped the open sign to closed because my aunt had forgotten to. I walked up to the Loft and sat in the bed trying desperately to rationalize what I had just seen. When I looked out the loft window and saw a man at the beach staring at me. He looked like an old fisherman, with long white hair and a bald spot in the center, he had overalls, a thick shirt and a heavy green jacket; though the most distinct things about him were his bright yellow eyes staring at me, and his severed hand that appeared to be replaced by a yellow and blue plastic kids shovel, he pulled a fish out of his overall pocket, bit its head off and kept walking along the beach.

So basically I’m freaking the fuck out right now, I don’t know exactly what I’ve gotten into, I’m typing this all up in the loft of the shop, some more stuff has gone on in the couple days I’ve been in this weird ass town but my phones almost dead and the only outlet in the entire building is in the shop area so I’m probably gonna go to sleep here soon, thanks for letting me vent. I’ll talk about more shit when my phone is charged. Goodnight all.
