My name is Gracie Hillman. This is the story of how my first love haunts me.
I grew up in a small town in vermont, it was just me and my mom. It used to be my dad too but he gave up when things got hard, and ever since then my mom couldn’t even look at me the same. I think i look too much like him, alls she can see in me is him, and that’s the last thing she wanted to see. 
 I’ve always been pretty lonely, i had friends, but only school friends. Nobody took actual interest in me. that was until i met Jackson Smith.

In August of 2023 i started at the University of Vermont. I met Jackson right away on my first day when he turned up late to the lecture and i offered him my notes. He was really sweet and funny and it wasn’t long until we became inseparable and i started practically living in his dorm room. 
We had been together for 8 months until i started to notice some of his weird behaviours that didn’t sit right with me. 

I noticed them subtly, it would start with weird favours he’d ask of me.
He’d wake me up in the middle of the night persistently, asking me to take his trash out which i didn’t like. The campus was pretty scary at night, and it was also fucking strange that he would want to take his trash out at 2 in the morning. I was too love blinded to even question him so i just let it be. 

There were a couple of times i’d get home and he would be ‘hiding’ from me. I caught him in the closet, under the bed and even in the shower. At first it was funny, we both laughed. Until he started doing it at night. And it became less about hiding. 
One night he told me he was going for a shower, he normally showers fast, but when he didn’t come back for half an hour i started to question where he was. I found him naked curled up in the laundry basket. When i walked in his eyes were on mine, as if he was waiting for me. This was the first incident that led me to shout at him, i didn’t find it funny anymore and i missed the old him, who i thought he was. I told him how weird he was behaving these past few weeks. Surprisingly, he was understanding. But the weirdness didn’t stop here.

One night in particular changed everything. It was our one year anniversary, the day he planned for us was beautiful. It had been a few weeks since any of his ‘weird’ behaviours and i honestly thought it was all in the past now. 
After a delicious dinner together, we got back to his dorm. i had already given him my gifts throughout the day, but he said he had one more for me when we got back home. We put a movie on, and he told me to wait on the couch whilst he got the present from the bedroom. He came back with a neatly wrapped box that looked heavy. He passed it to me and i unwrapped it to find a new kitchen utensil kit. I was so excited, cooking had always been something i’d enjoyed since i was a kid. This meant i could cook for him more professionally now and show off what i loved. I couldn’t help myself, i opened the box right away with the biggest smile on my face, even he looked excited. But when i saw the new knifes covered in blood. i felt my heart drop. I threw the box onto the floor with a clash and looked up at him with pure terror. He didn’t do this, right? 
He looked horrified and insisted that he needed to call the company right away. He walked off with his phone in his hands and left me there. 

As i was waiting for him to comeback, hoping for some reassuring news. I could’ve sworn i heard him laughing. Was this a prank? The laughing became louder, i felt more and more uneasy the longer it continued. 
A few minutes past, i got a whiff of this horrible smell. It was nothing i’d ever smelt before, it smelt like… death? 
The floorboards creaked, i looked up from my lap. Expecting to see Jackson with some news for me. 

What i saw was traumatising. 

Jackson was on his hands and knees, naked once again and he was covered in what looked like blood. i didn’t even recognise him. As he crawled closer and closer smiling at me, i got further and further away until i was backed up against the wall. i was trapped now. 
“WHAT THE FUCK” 
my words seemed to snap him out of whatever trance he was in. it was like he was possessed. he got off his hands and knees and stood up dripping with this unknown,thick, red mess. the once white carpet was now stained with red. He looked at me, his smile fading. He quickly spun round, ran back through the hall and locked himself in the bathroom. 

I probably should of left at this point, but something in me needed to know what happened in that bedroom. I cautiously walked along the corridor, what i assumed to be blood now all over my socks. i stepped over the floorboard i knew would creak as i didn’t want Jackson to know what i was about to find. 

The room looked surprisingly normal, but the smell. I can’t even put it into words. I had never smelt anything like it. Then I laid eyes on it, in the middle of the bed was a deceased animal. It was a raccoon. Its insides were scooped out of it and placed in a circle around it’s corpse. I immediately knew that my Jackson did this. But why? I still can’t answer that question to this day.

I couldn’t take the smell any longer. I had to get away from this disgusting scene. As I’m about to turn around i feel his breath on my neck. It’s enough to make all the hairs on my body stand on end. 
“Happy Anniversary Gracie” he whispered in a tone that i didn’t recognise.  
I turned around to him still bloody but no longer naked. 
“What the fuck is going on Jackson why are you doing this to me i’m scared and i’m sick of this!” i screamed now crying. 
He didn’t answer me. He just stood there, his blank expression not faltering. 
“Fuck you, you psycho. I’m leaving” 
That’s when his face morphed into a mix of anger and pure terror. 
“No. You cannot leave me Gracie.” 
He grabbed my wrist, leaving a bloody handprint which made me feel sick to my stomach.  
“I said you are not leaving me.”
I managed to slip out of his grip and i sprinted towards the door and ran for my life back to my dorm. I hadn’t been there for a while other than to pick up a few clothes every now and then. 

As soon as i stepped in the door, almost slipping, i took off my clothes and got straight in the shower to wash off all the blood. I couldn’t stop crying as the blood slowly washed away. My thoughts rushed through my head. I didn’t know who Jackson was anymore and I had to accept that. 

I didn’t sleep that whole night. I was terrified wondering wether he was going to show up. 

After that day, I never saw Jackson again but that definitely wasn’t the last i heard of him. He was the talk of the campus for a long time. After informing the police of what happened on that night, they told me that he was found in his dorm screaming covered in blood that was found to be animal blood. In his closet, they found multiple organs in jars belonging to all different species. Apparently there was eyes, brains and even hearts. He was taken away to Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital. 

I still wonder to this day what was going through his mind and if he ever really was with me for the right reasons. Was I just a cover up to his lies? Or was I his next victim?
