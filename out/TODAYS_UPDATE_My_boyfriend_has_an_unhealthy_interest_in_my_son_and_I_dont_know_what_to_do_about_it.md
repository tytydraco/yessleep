Sometimes, when we say, “things can’t get any worse,” the universe decides to throw 19.13 pounds of elephant shit into the fan. This short-circuits the wires, launching sparks onto the dining room table and lights your house on fire.

Right now, my life is somewhere between staring at the ashes and wondering just what kind of shit will come my way next. 

Everything started when my (ex) boyfriend, Darren (35M), started acting bizarre around my son, “Jordan” (10M). [I confronted Darren about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/12fjn3k/update_my_boyfriend_has_an_unhealthy_interest_in/), which resulted in him dragging me to my bedroom and pinning me against the mattress. That’s when a strange person crawled from the shadows of my room and slipped out the window. It was only then that Darren finally took his hand from my mouth.

“Just tell me what it will take for me to *never* see you again,” I hissed. 

He sighed once more, longer this time. “I’m afraid I can’t do that, Carol. The Order would retaliate. They believe I’m still working for them, but I can’t maintain the ruse for long. It’s an enormous risk, and I’ll only be able to continue keeping Jordan safe if you do *exactly* as I say.”

You’re probably wondering several things about that fucked up piece of information.

So was I.

Motherhood has a way of changing the way we think, however, so I skipped the bullshit. “Tell me what it takes to protect my son,” I answered in a surprisingly even tone. “Is there another man in *his* room?”

Darren flexed in reaction to my question, pinning my wrist to the bed and leaving my fingers tingling. “Not anymore.”

“Not any – just what the *fuck* does that mean, Darren?” I shot back. 

He leaned into my ear. “It means three things. The first is that, as of this moment, the Order has reason to get rid of me. The second is that I am *very* disposable in their eyes. The third is that I’m your only hope for keeping Darren safe. Now, can you get him packed and ready to leave within four minutes?”

I balked. “How can I trust you?”

He squeezed hard enough to cause pain. “Because, Carol, your very limited choices are between me and the man in the shadows who has been watching you sleep for *far* longer than you realize.”

For a second, my lungs stopped working. “Where are we going?”

He released my arm. “We don’t have time to think that far ahead. We need to run.” Then he rolled off of me.

I was thinking about what to do next when I realized that I was in Jordan’s room; my body had moved before my brain could piece together what was happening. He looked so tiny, sitting on the edge of the bed in his pajamas, that I couldn’t stop myself from throwing my arms around him and holding my son close.

We break in parts, slowly, so that the shock is lessened when we die. 

“Are you okay, Mommy?”

That was all he said. It was all he wanted to know.

I allowed five seconds of trembling silence before I pulled away and looked into his brown eyes. “I need you to get socks, underwear, and your toothbrush, okay, hun?”

He teetered on the verge of tears at that point, and I knew that he needed me to tell him that things were going to be okay, that he didn’t have to worry about anything, and that he believed I would give him what he needed. But I stayed silent; I watched the shock in his eyes as he realized that I wasn’t going to say the magic words to keep him safe like I did every time I checked under the bed or in his closet for the source of a mysterious sound. He realized that the world was too big for me to hold back. I felt something break in him that moment as he grew up a little bit, which is just another way to say that he got closer to the day that he would die.

I scrambled to help him get a few things into his Iron Man backpack. One minute later, we were moving back toward my bedroom. “Darren-” I choked on the word – “is going to help us get ready. We need to do exactly as he says-”

“Mom,” he whispered in a light tone that made my heart stop. “Darren has been doing some things that I don’t like.”

The feeling I had in that moment was very specific: I would have bet everything good in all the universes that, for at least a few seconds, I was the worst mother on earth.

I closed my eyes and swallowed. “I promise never to leave you alone with him again, hun. But for right now, I need you to go with me and him, okay?” I didn’t wait for an answer as I pushed open the bedroom door and dragged my son after me. 

The hallway spilled light into the room, illuminating the bed directly in front of me. I instantly wrapped my arms around Jordan’s head and pulled him against my stomach, but I know I was too late. 

Darren was splayed out on my bed. His wrists were bound to opposite bedposts, looking like he was spreading his arms in search of a gruesome hug. Someone had cut open his abdomen, and his intestines spilled out onto the bed like an enormous pot of bloody kielbasa had cracked apart. He couldn’t see me, though; both eyes had been plucked from their sockets. Twin trails of blood ran down his cheeks like unholy tears.

My muscles petrified as his legs slowly moved. *Oh God,* I thought, *he’s still alive.*

I looked in every direction – but no one else was there. Whoever had done this took under three minutes and had left us alone in the room, wondering what to do next as Jordan’s warm tears dampened my ribs while I pressed his face against my shirt.
