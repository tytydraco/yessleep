\*Knock, knock\*

The door pounds as I look at my mother. "Now remember what I told you," she exclaims, "Do not talk to your cousins unless I am present. Do not ask them any questions about their home life. They're not bad people just... misunderstood."

My mother takes a deep breath as she calmly stepped to the door, opening it. On the other side stood my Aunt Maggie, and my two cousins, Max and Melly. (Short for Melissa). Yeah, all M names. I remember them vaguley from when I was younger, but I haven't seen them in years, and my mom doesn't mention them much.

"Thank you for letting us stay with you... we won't be a bother, I promise." My aunt softly said, reaching out to give my mother a hug. Instead, my mom stepped back, dodging her embrace and replying coldly "It's alright, as long as your gone in the morning." The response seemed unnessecary. I wondered what my Aunt ever did to make my mom this harsh towards her. Nonetheless, my cousins stepped towards me in a friendly manner. "Hi V" Melly said kindly, giving me a side hug. "Hey V" Max said, giving an awkward wave and a sniffle, and then going back on his phone. 

"Well V I think it's time you go to bed, it's getting late." My mom interjected. I wanted to say that it was only 7PM, that there was no way that it was late. I wanted to say that i'd like to get to know my family, that I never knew kids so close to my age before. I could tell though by the look in her eye that it was a warning, a hint, to leave. So I did. 

The rest of the night I spent reading my books, and playing scary movies in the background for some noise. At one point I could of sworn I heard my mom and aunt shouting at each other, but it quickly stopped and I chalked it up to my imagination. Around 1 AM, I finally decided to call it a night and fall asleep. Finally I felt myself drifting, when I hear a faint sound. My eyes shoot open.

Footsteps.

As soon as my eyes opened, the footsteps stopped. Either they heard me jolt awake, or I really was hearing things. I sat in silence for what felt like 10 minutes, before I heard the noise again. More footsteps, and it sounded as if they were deliberately being quiet. Each step felt like an eternity, and I almost convinced myself I was just freaked out, until I saw the doorknob creak. 

I flung under my blankets, careful not to move a muscle but, I wanted to scream. Slowly, something reached down and pulled the blankets off of me. It was obvious that whoever it was wanted me to stay asleep, so that's what I did. As I lay there, I hear faint click. Suddenly it was brighter, but I was laying face first, and I still could not see anything. Terrified I laid there, listening to the clicking noises, before I hear a faint sniffle. 

Wait. That sniffle sounded familiar. Max?

I was confused, and even more, terrified. I was too young to even begin to understand what could be going on here, and it made my heart rate fly through the roof. I heard one more click before, who I thought was Max, pulled the blankets back over me and quickly exited the room. 

I was scared, but honestly, he didn't hurt me, or give any proof that he was ever in my room at all. And knowing how angry my mom already was at my aunt, I didn't want to stir any more drama. Eventually, around 4AM, I was able to go back so sleep. 

The next day, when I came downstairs, everyone was gone, my Aunt and cousins leaving no trace. My mom had work, I had the house to myself. I always loved when this happened, because I could relax and watch TV without having to worry about anything else. The 'incident' with Max periodically raced through my mind, but more than anything I was just happy they were gone.

A couple of hours later, maybe around 3 or 4PM, the home phone rang. Normally this wouldn't be unusual, but my mom never called while she was working, and I sure wasn't expecting any calls anytime soon. Swiftly I moved to the phone, answering with a short "Hello?". On the other end, I heard another familiar sniffle- and my heart dropped to my stomach. I sat there in shock, and after an awkward silence, Max replies- "Hey V. Can we talk about something? It's Max." I sat there again in silence, unable to anwser. After a moment, I was able to respond. "Sure?"

"Ok. I want you to know that you can tell me anything. You don't have to be scared to talk to me. I'm going to ask you something and please, be honest with me. Whatever the response, I won't be mad.... I promise." He spoke almost nervously. At this point I did not know what to expect from him, and I mumbled something like "Mhm" before he spoke again.

"I'm not sure if you remember last night, but I need to know. Where did all those bruises come from?"
