Has anyone ever heard of Halden BioDynamics?

I started a new job three months ago at the mid-sized logistics firm. It’s one of those places that feels sterile but efficient, white lighting, gray walls, quiet hallways that smell faintly of toner.

They told me I’d be joining the “Data Continuity Department.” The name meant nothing to me, but the pay was good and the benefits were great. My official title is Monitoring Assistant.

My first day, my manager - a man named Dennis with the calm voice of a funeral director told me my role was to “track behavioral anomalies” during work hours.  
When I asked what that meant, he smiled like I’d asked about the weather.

“We make sure everyone’s working at their best.”

That was it.

**The Routine**

The office layout is strange.  
Most departments are open-plan, but ours is tucked away at the end of a long corridor with a keypad lock. Inside, there are eight of us. No windows. Just screens.

Each monitor shows live video feeds from different office floors.  
Employees at their desks. Elevators. Break rooms. Even stairwells.

Dennis told me we weren’t security, we were “efficiency auditors.”  
Our job was to watch for deviations*.*  
Someone leaving their desk too often.  
Someone staring too long at a blank screen.  
Someone whispering.

When we found one, we logged the timestamp and floor number into the system. The computer flagged it automatically for review.

“Don’t worry about outcomes,” Dennis said. “We don’t handle discipline.”

That sentence should have made me feel better. It didn’t.

**The Observation**

At first, it was boring, just people being people. But after a few weeks, I noticed something odd.

Certain employees disappeared from the feeds.  
Not all at once, just gaps.  
One day, a cubicle would be empty. Then a few days later, someone new would be sitting there.

When I asked Dennis about it, he said turnover was normal.

Still, I started keeping notes.  
Not official logs, just personal ones, written in a notebook I kept hidden in my bag.  
Names. Dates. Desk locations.

After about a month, I had 32 names.

**The Sound**

Two weeks ago, we got new software. It added audio feeds to our video monitors.

Now we could hear what was happening.

Dennis said it was to detect “unproductive chatter.”

Most of the time it was silence. Just typing, keyboard clicks, chair creaks.  
But every now and then, there’d be… something else.

A low humming sound.  
Not machinery, not the vents. Something human, but wordless. Like someone trying not to cry.

The first time I heard it, I looked at Dennis. He had his headset on and didn’t even flinch.

I rewound the footage to find where it started. The timestamp was 12:14:03 PM.  
When I tried to replay it again five minutes later, the audio file was gone.

**The Woman**

Last Friday, I was assigned to review “Floor 6 - Cubicle Zone C.”  
That’s where I saw her.

A woman I didn’t recognize, sitting stiffly at her desk, staring straight at the monitor. She didn’t move for an entire hour.

No typing. No blinking.

When I zoomed in, I realized her computer wasn’t even on.

The next day, she was gone.

But her chair was occupied again.  
By someone new.

Someone who looked almost the same - same build, same hairstyle, same posture - but not quite.  
Like she’d been replaced by a slightly different version.

**The File**

Yesterday, Dennis called me into his office.  
He said my “attention to detail” was excellent, and that he wanted to show me something advanced.

He handed me a keycard and told me to check the subfloor storage area after hours.  
He said I’d find “context” there.

That word stuck with me.

After everyone left, I used the keycard.  
The elevator went lower than I thought the building even went.

Subfloor B.

The door opened to a freezing corridor lined with metal doors.  
Only one was unlocked.  
Inside were shelves stacked with identical black boxes, each labeled with a name and date.

The earliest one was from 2017.  
The most recent?  
Today’s date.

And the label on that one had my name on it.

**Replacement**

I don’t remember leaving the subfloor. I don’t remember getting home.

But I woke up this morning, and my phone was full of work emails. Routine ones.  
Meeting reminders. Schedule updates.

Except one.  
From Dennis.

It said:

“Welcome to Continuity. Your previous file has been archived successfully.  
Please report to your workstation at 9:00 AM.”

I looked in the mirror before I left for work.  
Something about my face looked off.  
Not wrong exactly. Just slightly different.

Like I’d been replaced by a slightly better version.
