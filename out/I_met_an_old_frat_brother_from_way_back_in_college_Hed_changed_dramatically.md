I'd like to say this first: We were in the same fraternity when we were going to college. He was quite a party animal back in the day. So much so that he earned the fraternity nickname Jamboree.

I was on a special night out with my boyfriend Tanner (yes, I'm gay, don't judge me). We were at a ballroom party for the induction of a new local robotics program he and I initiated. Tanner and I were both engineering majors.

Then, someone came along. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but I knew I'd seen this guy before when I first noticed him.

"Oh, hello, Harlan. Do you remember me?"

"No, sir. I don't know you."

"Do you remember? Back in \[xxxxxx\] University, Popcorn?"

"How do you know my old fraternity nickname?"

"I was *very* obese back then. You probably remember me like this."

Then the guy did that thing where you inflate your cheeks. I had the sudden realization that--

"Oh, Jamboree! It's been a while! What a surprise to see you here!"

I did, of course, remember Jamboree being very fat. He'd lost a lot of weight since!

"Likewise, Popcorn. In fact, my industry is beginning and we're in need of your unique abilities."

"You want robotics and engineering in your industry. Are you some kind of cyberfreak now, Jamboree?"

&#x200B;

I'd gotten a job opportunity at an obscure, local, very new company called Hepburn Industries. It was started by Theodore "Jamboree" Hepburn about a year ago, and he said to me when I got a tour of the building that he'd just bought,

"I want to have robotics in the industry. I want robots, to help create my machines. I want your research into robotics."

I hoped he was faking the creepiness of the tone of voice, but he seemed unsettling.

I took the job with stride. Jamboree said he'd be willing to give me unlimited funding on my research and I'd have my own lab. I should have listened to Tanner when he said this sounded fishy.

"Harlan, please. I don't like this. How could a crazy party animal like Jamboree have a *robotics* company?!"

Of course, when I toured the building, the lab appeared like one in the movies. Then, Jamboree showed me to what he said would be my own "lab."

Big mistake. It didn't look one bit like a lab.

The walls appeared rotting. And the ceiling was somewhat leaky. The room appeared to have a bed that looked somewhat eaten. By rats, as I'd assume.

I heard something that sounded like an intercom.

*"Popcorn, the lab equipment is in the closet. Bring it out, and work on your research."*

Jamboree's voice was on the other end of the intercom.

*"Work on the robotics...* ***forever!****"*

&#x200B;

After three days, I was sure Tanner was worried for me. When one of the employees of the company came in the room after one day, I had been handcuffed to the table where I had been forced to work on the machine parts.

I wished I hadn't taken the job opportunity, let alone fallen for his trick. I hadn't even noticed myself in any mirrors. But after a while on the third day, I decided I was finally sick of the bullshit and I tried to escape.

When I tried picking the locks on that set of handcuffs, though, some kind of alarm was going off.

And then I heard this crazy message over the intercom.

*"Warning! This is an emergency! Subject 12 is escaping! Take the emergency measures now!"*

Then some group of who I assumed to be employees of Jamboree came in, looking like they were in hazmat suits. I was held down, and then knocked out.

I woke up again, handcuffed to the table. But this time, my legs were manacled to the chair legs.

Then, I decided to put some of my engineering skills to use and decided to try creating something to bypass the alarm system that was in these things, and then unlock myself and escape. I pretended to still be working on the projects Jamboree was trying to make me do.

And then, as I did it again, with the bypass thing working, I freed myself from the restraints keeping me at the work bench.

I looked around for camera systems. Sure enough, there was one camera that seemed to be pointed at me.

I forged a pin under the guise of working further on the thing I was being forced to do. And then, I shot it at the camera like a spitball, disabling it.

Then, I used the materials in the room to create makeshift tools for escape. It felt like my life mattered more than anything else. I opened the door, which appeared to have an alarm system built in. So I disabled it with my newly created bypass device, and got out the door.

One of the employees seemed to be standing guard. I knocked him out, and dragged him inside. Then I stole his clothes and stuffed his body in the "closet," which was really a hidden compartment in one of the walls of the room.

I then looked at the doors of the other rooms. Each room had been marked with a number.

The door of the room I got out of was marked with the number 12.

(*Subject 12 is escaping!*)

The rooms, I realized, had different "subjects" under the thumb of Jamboree. One through 11 if you don't count the room I was in.

Sweating out of fear that I would blow my cover, I used the bypass device and makeshift lockpick to unlock the doors, one by one, without tripping the alarm system.

With more pins forged in my room in case of it, I shot them like spitballs at the cameras.

I started with 11. Inside the room was a woman. She was around 15 from the looks of it.

"H-Hello?"

"Get back, guy! Are you here to hold me down again for not performing?!"

"Performing?"

"You work for that Hepburn, don't you?!"

"Hey!" I whispered. "I'm not with him."

"Your clothes say otherwise! It's been a week and I'm still being forced by guys like you to dance!"

I then showed her out of the room and then took her to my room.

"Y-You're the Subject 12?"

"I made a mistake to take what I assumed to be a robotics industry job opportunity."

"So that's what you were lured into this place with?"

"I'm wearing these as a disguise."

"Okay, good. Sorry for the identity mistake. I'm Rani."

"I'm Harlan."

&#x200B;

In Room 10, a man called Roberto, at around 30 years old. He'd been here for a month. He was lured into the room with a job offer to be a mechanic.

In Room 9, a woman called Alice, who was about 25 years old. She'd been here for a month and a half. She was told she'd get to study to be a doctor.

In Room 8, a woman called Terry, who was 19 years old. She'd been here for 3 months. She'd been fooled by Jamboree into thinking she'd get to achieve her dream of being a fortuneteller. She'd had a set of tarot cards on her.

In Room 7, a man called Norris. He was somewhat elderly. He'd been here 3 months, around the same time Terry was lured inside. He'd been lured into it by a ruse that he'd go into a quality rest home that would care for him unlike any other rest home.

In Room 6, a teenage girl called Beverly. She'd been here 4 months, lured into Hepburn Industries by being told she'd have her own art studio and would have complete control over the art she would make.

In Room 5, a little boy called Miguel. He'd been here 5 months. He'd been lured into thinking he'd be in a school with a very low chance of bullying.

In Room 4, a woman called Maureen. She is a college student, and she'd been here 5 months, lured into thinking she'd be living in a dorm where she could study without much of a chance of rape.

In Room 3, another teenage girl. She was called Kaley. She'd been here 5 months and was lured into this diabolical trap under the ruse that she'd be in foster care, away from her abusive parents.

In Room 2, an enby who had just graduated high school, called Ghost. Fae was here 6 months, lured by the ruse of applying for college. Fae was scared I was one of the employees, but I managed to calm faer down.

And finally, in Room 1, I had freed with the bypass device and my lockpick the first person Jamboree had lured inside. It took a while, but when I remembered seeing this woman's face on a milk carton...

"Stop! Stop! Don't do it again! I'll cooperate, I swear!"

"Don't worry!"

"Don't worry, my left foot!"

It took a while to calm her down and finally prove to her that we, the escaped "subjects" of this company, were really in disguise to fool the others.

Apparently, she'd been here for over a year. Before Jamboree had started his own company.

"So you're Yolanda? I've seen your face on missing posters and stuff."

"Wait, really?"

&#x200B;

All twelve of us decided to put together a plan to escape the building should any of us be exposed. I'd been the one to put together the devices used to help us escape, like the alarm bypassing device that helped us get out without tripping the system and the pins that destroyed the cameras.

That, and knocking out each of the employees to disguise ourselves. Maureen and Miguel had the idea to disguise themselves as one person, because Miguel was almost 7 and Maureen could carry a small child on her shoulders at her height and build.

We were trying to power through the fears, but we were mostly afraid of our covers being blown.

Each of the doors had to be closed after getting out, so that we could make it look like the "subjects" were still locked inside.

I'd explained to them that I'd known Jamboree before. He and I went to the same university those few years ago. He'd never been like this before this... stuff.

And they believed me when I told them about him being a party animal.

"Hey, Harlan!" Ghost interjected. "How about we just leave the premises and then take off the disguises when we're out of sight?"

"Not bad, but we need to be out of camera range first." I replied.

We were putting together an escape plan in what appeared to be a kind of break room. It was Roberto's idea to disguise it as having coffee while on break. Then, we were paralyzed with fear when something got said over the intercom.

*"Attention, all employees! All test subjects have escaped the experiment! Watch out for employees you do not recognize!"*

I began to feel scared. It was as if we were beginning to go to survival mode.

This was the time we decided to put our escape plan into motion.

&#x200B;

When I pilfered some maps from one of the guards near the breakroom entrance, I figured out that we'd be going up stairs to get to some kind of ground floor. Two floors to go up. That seemed like it'd be easy, right?

But there were no ramps. Norris would have a hard time going up the stairs.

But this struck an idea. I decided that to go up the stairs, we would put together our minds to get us *all* up the stairs.

Using materials I could find within the area, I forged what appeared to be a dolly, and then created a kind of cot and box, to have Norris in.

Norris was adamant that he use an elevator, but I had to tell him that the place had no elevators, by design.

In doing this thing, Norris wasn't happy about me having us carry him in the thing, but it was better than all of us losing too much strength by carrying his body. So he had to go along with it.

And once we were up both flights of stairs, an alarm went off. Then an intercom message came up. Again.

*"Attention, all employees! All test subjects have reached the ground floor! Watch for a group carrying an old man up some stairs!"*

"Fuck! I forgot to disable the stair cameras!"

"Harlan, did you forget we have a small child with us?!"

"Sorry, Beverly! Sorry!"

&#x200B;

We'd gone to a breakroom on the ground floor. Apparently, the employees were gone from the floor.

So we'd then taken Norris out of the box and dolly, and then I took apart the dolly to create a weapon should we encounter any of the place's employees, let alone Jamboree.

Norris was not happy, but then he calmed down knowing it was either that or leave him behind.

Then, I recognized the front entrance.

"Okay, everyone!" I shouted, making it look like I was commanding employees about the "test subjects." "Listen up! I noticed that they have reached the front entrance! Let's move it!"

&#x200B;

After getting out the front entrance, we hid between cars, that we assumed to belong to employees.

"Can any of you drive?"

Apparently, Terry was the only one capable of driving besides me.

I decided to use my skills again. Still afraid of getting caught, I sure enough found a spare key in a black van's secret compartment by a gas tank. The van was thankfully big enough to fit everybody.

And because I knew they needed to escape, I decided on staying behind to fight off the rest of the employees so that they could go and then I'd catch up to them.

I decided that if I caught up to them after escaping, I'd beep the horn three times.

A whole horde of these soldiers, aka Hepburn Industries employees, was after us. I wasted no time in using some engine parts and leftover bits of metal from inside the place to create a makeshift gun. I either shot or knocked out each of them.

Then, they all suddenly stopped.

Jamboree began coming out from behind each of them.

"Popcorn! C'mon, we can work this out!"

I jumped, and was about to run when I suddenly noticed something... strange.

"Popcorn! Thanks to you, my contract with the demon Colbran is null! I'll never make it to heaven now!"

He shouted that as he fucking floated in the air!

"I was to exercise the skills of all that I could! So that I could put together a perfect being for Colbran! Now it's impossible! You nullified my contract, Popcorn!"

And I was paralyzed with fear as he floated toward me.

"I sold my soul to Colbran, who said that if I created the perfect being for him, I'd make it to Heaven! Now I'll never go! Damn you, Popcorn!"

I was terrified for my life by then, but I found my courage and shouted to him,

*"Two things, Jamboree! One, you are completely deranged, and two, I liked you better* ***fat***\*!"\*

I was about to run when he'd frozen in place with what looked like an astonished expression on his face.

As he was coming at me with his demonic appearance and powers and whatnot, he looked excited.

"I'm ready to binge! Gimme some cake! Roast me some marshmallows and give me s'more!"

I found a key in a secret compartment in a vehicle, and I was about to get in when a demonic tentacle grabbed my arm.

"You're all I need for the perfect being! Why must you go back to that damned Tanner?!"

The tentacle came from Jamboree. This was enough to make adrenaline flow right to my brain and make me break the fuck out of his grip.

And I unlocked the car and got inside. Turning the key, I started the engine, which I realized had half a tank of gas.

No matter. The half a tank could get me the fuck out of here ASAP.

I was in the car, cowering as Jamboree, who was in fact no longer the Jamboree I once knew, was trying to break into the car. His face had contorted and become something incredibly creepy.

And I backed out, not caring who or what was behind me anymore, though I'd looked in the rearview mirrors. I backed out of the parking lot quickly, and once I got out into the road, I saw Jamboree dissolving before my very eyes.

"NOOO!! I'M DONE FOR!! MY CONTRACT WITH COLBRAN IS NULLIFIED!! NOOOOOO!!!"

And his body soon became nothing more than a pile of ashes.

&#x200B;

Now, along with Tanner, we decided to meet every year to catch up on our lives since our escape 2 years ago. Norris died last month. Alice is now finishing up on medical school. Roberto is training to be a mechanic. Rani is now a budding street musician. Terry is making a living as a tarot reader. Beverly is now a painter and sculptor who makes money from commissions. Miguel is homeschooled now, in hopes that neither he nor his parents fall for a trap like it again. Maureen is now back in college. Kaley is now living with Terry, since her parents are now in prison for theft. Ghost is now going to college, and fae has great grades so far. Yolanda is now living with her family again, after so long. I never knew she was a mom until last year.

I am writing this on the new smartphone I had just bought. I'm making money from the program me and Tanner, who are engaged now, started. We're currently working on moving a robotic arm!

Let us hope we never experience that thing again. I'll never forget how scared I was from seeing Jamboree as a demon...
