Firstly I’d like to identify my role in this story, or I should probably say, the lack thereof. I’m not the main proprietor, simply a friend of her. A girl named Rebecca Koui, and I had simply renamed her as Kay. She was an astounding writer while not going through any journalistic endeavors, she would start working at the local radio station as a reporter and rookie journalist. It was a given that she’d lead a successful career in her news field, albeit, a slow starting one. She led a good life in the collegiate space, which is not only where we met, but where we knew each other. She was the kindest and most helpful person I knew, she’d led not only herself, but me as well. But I think it’s time I show you the logs of the following events. As harrowing as they may seem, let me know about any bits of information you may wander upon, as for reasons you’ll glean further on, finding out might be the only way of rehabilitating my mind. Anyways, let me show you the undoubtedly fascinating yet decrepitly disturbing story that lie amongst my trash folder.

[Log 1] 08/21/15

As I sit awaiting a guest, a highly anticipated knock on the door reverberates through the cabin almost as if his hand in a hardened fist to knock the door down. But almost reflexively I open the door before he gets a negative connotation on my name. Jack H. Orathy’s being stands tall in the door frame, alluring to a presumably active man.

Kay: Nice to meet you sir, care for water, tea, or coffee?

Jack: No ma’am I’m all good. Ready to start?

His frame suggests a more rugged and coarse thinking man. Surprised by his sincerity to my inquisition I prepare myself for the rest of our inevitable interview.

Kay: Well, may we get started?

As I realize I just answered his question with another question I begin the discussion. Throughout the entire interview I asked him 15 or so questions about his life and the knowledge that was contained within the invitation he sent the station earlier in the week.

Kay: So where did you hear about the fabled, Broken Road?

I asked the question in a cynical fashion as while yes, it’s what I believed, it would also lead to a plenty more interesting conversation. One that unbeknownst to me, would lead me to an unconceivable degree of self disparity and horror.

Jack: Well it technically started with a friend of mine dragging me along to all these supposedly “haunted” spots. We’d all make jokes about it to him until the broken road.

Kay: What was his name and what was bewildering about the broken road that made you start taking it seriously?

Jack: His name was Palo Julian, but we called him Palo Pinto. But as to answer your second question, it wasn’t the bewilderment per se, but the overarching conglomeration of everything before hand that led to a more serious understanding. And it didn’t help that the broken road was certainly a step up from what we were use to seeing.

For a man of so few words he certainly didn’t mind going in depth into how this all came to be. So with my journalistic integrity as fierce as ever, I pressed further, thinking there to be a chance that I get much more information than what I bargained for.

Kay: Was Gordon the road or the destination?

His face broke a stammered look, perhaps surprised by the fact that I knew about Gordon at all. Jack gulps and begins to answer.

Jack: Well by technicality Gordon is the destination but no one’s ever made it to the point of Gordon, so, we call the road Gordon for convenience sake.

Kay: So no one has ever made it to the real Gordon?

Jack: Nope.

Kay: And that’s why you agreed to the interview?

Jack: Yep.
Jack: So, would you come with me?

I’m bereft of conversation, I can’t understand why but I almost sensed he was going to ask that question. I answered back reluctantly, yet in a steadfast attempt to get to the bottom of Gordon.

Kay: Yes, undoubtedly yes.

Jack: Good; I’m glad to have some more company on the team now.

I’m quickly stammered, his sentence catches me off guard.

Kay: Team?

Jack: Mhm, surely you did enough research to know I’m not one to go into dangerous territory with just 2 people. I fought in the Korean War after all.

He was right, I did multitudes of research on the man sitting before me but I certainly wasn’t expecting this kind of situation.

Kay: How many people?

Jack: An 8 car resistance.

Surprised yet a little disappointed that my logging might be interrupted by multiple people joining the convoy. But Jack ultimately is the one whom interrupts my thought.

Jack: I personally suggest you head off to bed, we have a long day ahead of us in the mornin’. So be packed and ready to leave by 9:00 AM.

He laughs at his own timidness and I can’t help but to smile at his own sarcastic quips.

Kay: Hm, okay. 

We part ways, going to bed in separate rooms, aware of our 2 very different and poorly veiled opinions. Me, a cynic to this whole thing, and him, a middle aged guy with excitement on his face ready to show me he’s right and I’m wrong.

[Log 1] 08/22/15

I wake up in the morning at about 7:15 AM, and with Jacks being standing over me. While yes, it’s pretty uncomfortable to have my interview-ee standing over me with breakfast the morning after the interview, I presume he’s an older man and and is a caring man at that. I don’t manage to record the start of our conversation.

Jack: I made you some eggs, biscuits and gravy, bacon, and waffles. I thought that I’d make somethin’ nice ‘cause we won’t be eating this on the road.

I thought this was a caring man and I was right. Now all I was concerned with was if I could trust him. Ultimately even if I didn’t trust him, I was going to be his accomplice for however long it took to get to the end of the broken road. But besides all of that journalistic filler, he certainly made a mean bowl of biscuits and gravy. As I get out of bed, take a shower, and get dressed with a comfortable yet practical sheet of clothes. I wander downstairs to Jack packing up all his stuff and carrying it outside to gently pack it into his car.

Kay: Why are you packing? I thought you had already packed everything.

Jack: If you ain’t ready the mornin’ of, you ain’t ready.

His claim stands on its own merit as I can’t really argue with its validity. 

Kay: What kind of car are we taking?

Jack: She’s an oldie but a goodie. I’m talkin’ about a 1992 Jeep Wrangler with an optional skylight. It has LEDs that’ll make night look like the sun is only a few inches away.

As he wheels the beast of a car out he simply asks for my opinion.

Jack: what d’ya think?

Kay: I think you’re a few EEDs short of an international threat.

He laughs at the remark thinking I’m joking.

Kay: I’m being serious Jack, I don’t even think a tank could pierce this thing!

Jack: Well thank you for all the compliments and support, I can clearly tell it’s a hit with the audience.

Yet another one of his sarcastic quips rings about my ears threatening my brain with a slight laugh.

Also as I’m typing this up i should say that at this current time in the story we are located in rural Alabama. As they say the broken road lies in between 2 mountains in Magnolia Springs. And that most abnormally, it isn’t visible unless you’re looking for it.

Jack: I’m just about done gettin’ packed up for the road, if you wanna bring anything along, keep it with you or pack it in the back.

Kay: um, yeah I’ll get my laptop and headphones, that’ll be it.

Jack: Alright well we got Alice showin’ up in 7, but I ain’t got nothin’ on the rest. Sent the schedule in June too.

Soon, Alice pulls up in a luxurious but sturdy car, a Range Rover. Conversation is ignited between Alice and Jack quickly.

Jack: Hey! First one to show?

Alice: Yeah, there was some traffic out there but once I started down Hwy 6 it stopped.

Jack: Well we’re still currently waiting on the others to show, but until then, I have some food inside if you wanna heat it up.

Alice: OK… but who’s the girl?

Jack: This is Kay; she’s a journalist and reporter for a radio station across the pond.

Kay: More specifically, in Ireland.

Alice: Ah, well good to know; nice to meet you.

Kay: Nice to meet you too.

She nods her head and walks off towards the entrance of Jacks estate. As she steps in through the threshold of his door 2 more people arrive; Brimney and Forest. As they step onto the sidewalk, outstretching their legs from their Ford F-250, Jack jumps up to greet them.

Jack: Hey, how’s it goin’ guys?

Forest: It’s going well, sorry we weren’t able to let you know when we were gonna get here, service got really bad on Hwy 6.

Brimney: Yeah we were completely out of service the last 5 minutes up the road too.

Jack: That’s odd, normally service is pretty stable around here, especially on Hwy 6.

Forest: Well as soon as we exited off to Hwy 6, it got pretty spotty.

Brimney: And the dirt road was the worst! Don’t be surprised when you get pinged with 5 unsent messages from us.

I found it pretty amusing at the time that Brimney almost had a penchant for responding directly after Forest proclaimed something. I chalked it up to them being closely related and that they’ve had that dynamic for some time.

Brimney: Hey! Aren’t you the journalist for 102.3 The Hub?

I’m ultimately pretty impressed at her ability to recognize me, I’m guessing she properly did her research but even with her doing that, she still got the name wrong.

Kay: Actually the namesake is wrong, it’s 102.3 The Pub. It’s from Ireland so we have a lot of pubs over there, but yes I am.

Brimney: Oh sorry about that, I get names mixed around sometimes but it’s nice to meet you; I love your work.

Kay: Nice to meet you too. Maybe you’ll get to see this very report after we’re done.

Brimney looks at me ecstatically as she utters the words… “Will I be in it?” I take a second to answer and say… “You’ll have a special spot.” Now I’ll admit, I didn’t really know what I meant by “special spot”, but it was mostly just to make her happy. And I think I succeeded in that pursuit.

Jack: Oh and by the way we have food inside if you wanna heat some up. Just know there is another convoy member in there so don’t be scared when you see her.

Jack says his statement with a little sincerity and he ultimately chuckles a little bit at his own remark.

Forest: Oh yeah we’ll make sure too. Also, what’s her name?

Jack: Her names Alice. She seems hidden behind the bush right now so be careful with conversation.

As he says this Alice comes walking out of the door and overhears Jack say these words. 

Alice: If you wanna say something bad about me; say it to my face.

Jacks: Oh no no, I wasn’t saying anything bad just that you don’t really feel like talking right now.

Alice: Well you’re right. I’m on a trip that I don’t even know if it’s real or a hoax, with people I don’t even know. So don’t come bashin’ me ‘cause I’m not comfortable.

Jack takes notice of the splotches of gravy on and around her mouth and makes a statement which in his head was probably meant to deescalate the predicament but really only made it worse.

Jack: Well it looks like you enjoyed breakfast.

Alice precedes to walk to her car, slam the door shut, and recline the seat. Presumably trying to calm herself down from Jacks pitiful attempt at reconciling her.

Kay: Welp that didn’t work out did it.

Jack: I guess not.

As we sit around for the next few minutes on the porch with Brimney and Forest and Alice still in her car, we hear the running engine of what we’re hoping to be more members of the convoy. Luckily, our fortune was granted, as Adam and Gale come bounding up the hillside towards Jacks’ front-way. 

Brimney: Is that more of the resistance?

Jack: Yep, by the looks of the car that should be Adam and Gale.

Now how he recognized the residence of the vehicle based off of the vehicle is perplexing to me as it was a basic, grey Ford Focus. I simply would’ve thought it was just another hillbilly driving crazily through the woods. But as I finish my thought Adam and Gale pull up behind Alice’s car. But this time Jack isn’t the one to greet first. As Brimney bounds off the porch to steadfastly meet the two. I can see a slight look of annoyance flash across Jacks face.

Brimney: Hey Adam, hey Gale!

The two look surprised at the swift pace of the greeting that Brimney presented.

Adam: Oh hey, I thought you were a g-

Before Adam can finish his sentence Jack chimes in to present the truth.

Jack: I’m the ferryman, that’s Brimney.

Adam: Oh okay, just had to make sure I was in the right place.

Jack: Yeah you’re in the right place. sorry about that.

Adam: No you’re fine; I guess she’s just excited. But I should probably introduce ourselves, this is Gale my wife for the past 15 years.

Gale: And this is Adam, my husband for the past 15 years.

I could tell their chemistry was well orchestrated in the “we finish each others sentences” kind of way.

Jack: Well it’s incredible meeting you two; if you guys want, there should be exactly 2 plates worth of food still in there if you guys are hungry.

Gale: Oh no it’s fine, we stopped at the Cracker Barrel down in Magnolia.

Jack: Kay what time is it?

Kay: 8:35, why?

Jack: Well I’ll probably throw out the rest since if any of the other people show up, it’ll be too late to grab a bite to eat.

As Jack heads inside to throw the plates out we start to hear rumbling like we’ve never heard before. It’s as if the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse are stampeding towards us and gaining ground fast. As Jack steps back outside he asks… “What in Gods green earth is makin’ all that racket?”

Adam: Sounds like a bulldozer chewing up the ground.

As soon as the words are uttered from his mouth an intensively modified Semi-Truck comes barreling out of the woodwork, with the words on the side reading, “The Resistance.” In an apocalyptic font. Soon enough, they stop on the side of Jacks property, the chassis of the truck giving way to 3 different people. As Tulip, Jay, and Rosemary tumble out of the truck, Jack has already sprinted over to their location.  But as they walk up to him, Jack in a whiplashed state from the pure sight of the semi-truck, his vocals start giving way.

Jack: What a truck.

Jay: I know right? The back chassis is completely stock full of jerrycans, all kinds of food, thousands of pounds of water, and tons of survival equipment.

Jack: Looks like we won’t be havin’ to worry about the first few days at all.

Jay: Oh no, we’ve got enough in here to last everyone here 3 weeks at the least.

Jack: Well good to know that we won’t have to worry, good on you for bringin’ all this.

Jay: Thank you, seems like you’re well suited yourself.

As Jay points to Jacks car they both instinctively walk over to it and begin to talk shop.

Tulip: Are you the journalist from Ireland?

The statement caught me by surprise because this woman who presented herself with a rough and rugged appearance was the one directing to me in a soft melancholy voice.

Kay: Oh, yeah my names Rebecca Koui, you can just call me Kay. Nice to meet you.

Tulip: Nice to meet you too. I’ve heard tons about your integrity from Jack. Says you’re the best when it comes to cracking down on a case.

Kay: Well I’m not a detective but I’m known for getting answers where no one else can.

I noticed a somewhat undeniable silence coming from rosemary. I know it sounds crazy especially since we barely knew each other but… it felt personal.

Kay: Do you guys happen to know when any of the others will be here?

Tulip: Mace said he was coming up the dirt road 5 minutes ago so I wouldn’t be surprised if he showed up right now

As my clock dinged on 8:50, I was a little worried for Jacks sake that we weren’t going to have the rest of the people along for the trip.

Tulip: There’s Mace!

As Mace pulls up in his Chevy Malibu, Jack excuses himself from his conversation with Jay and walks over to meet Mace.

Jack: How much were you able to fit inside that car of yours?

Mace: Don’t worry, I removed the back seats and used it all for kit; so I have plenty.

Jack: Well that’s good ‘cause the normal room wouldn’t be nearly enough.

Mace: Yeah trust me, I figured that one out.

Kay: Do you happen to know where the others are?

Mace: I know that Leo and Yori are close, they were only a few minutes behind me.

Kay: well it’s 8:57 so it would be in their best interest to be a little swifter.

Mace: Yeah tried tellin’ them that at 8:30 but they said, “There’s enough time.” 

But as always, we start to hear the low rumbling of a car and its passengers coming up the hillside and through the forest. Soon enough, Leo and Yori are standing in front of me and Jack lighting up conversation.

Yori: Hi my names Yori, I’m a Japanese Seismologist and I got my PhD from the University of Tokyo. You must be Koui?

Kay: You can just call me Kay, but yes I’m the journalist for this current trip and a reporter for a radio station is Ireland.

I could immediately tell that Yori was extraordinarily over professional, to the point where it was hard for me to be able to tell if she was sparking discussion off interest or pure speculation.

Leo: Sorry she’s so professional, she’s been like that since we were little.

Kay: Oh no it’s fine, she fits in well with the rest of the group and she may be able to help with understanding more about whatever we’re getting ourselves into.

I said this in less of cynical way and more of a believing way because the fact that my veiled opinion to everyone else is that I’m a naive cynic, so I wanted to show really the only person here with any kind of scientific background a different story. One in which I’ll get more information out of her and what she may believe.

Kay: Also, do you know where the last person may be?

Leo: he was a minute or so behind us so I’m sure he’ll be here soon.

Jack: Let’s go Kay it’s 9:00.

Kay: We’re still missing the last person.

Jack: Well he wasn’t here by the time on the itinerary so he’ll just run into us if he’s almost here.

Kay: OK…

As we all pile into our different trucks respectively, we start to leave in order of arrival. So Me and Jack, Alice, Brimney and Forest, Adam and Gale, Tulip, Jay and Rosemary, Mace, and Leo and Yori. While yes it’s quiet a lot of people, it’s not as much as it could be. As we all pile out Jack starts speaking over the Walkie system.

Jack: Jack to all cars… can ya hear me good?

A collective response from each car one by one rings out as a resounding yes. I can see a quick smirk flash across Jacks face as validation occurs.

Jack: Alright, I don’t wanna use this Walkie system for anything bu-

He’s cut off by a decrepitly confusing sight on the side of the road. There, on the right side of the tarmac, lies a dark grey ford explorer, it’s content spilling about.

Jack: Everybody halt!

As everybody collectively stops their cars, they all realize the sight that lay before them. Jack jumps out his car and runs over to the driver side of the car. There lies Gian, the lone last member of the convoy stricken on the side of the road.

Jack: What th- , are you okay!? What happened?

He softly opens his eyes and speaks to Jack in an impossibly deep voice.

Gian: Yeah I’m just fine, car ain’t drivable no more ‘cause some animal ran me off the road. Mind if I hop in with one of y’all?

Mace: He can hop in with me, I’ll get to the back of the convoy so we’ll stay in order.

Jack: Okay; Go to Maces car, he’s gonna keep you the rest of the trip. 

Gian: Okay, thanks Jack, thank you Mace.

Mace: Yeah no problem man just hop in.

Gian quickly stumbles over to the passenger side of Maces car and pulls himself inside. Mace quickly takes a diagonal angle to the road and pulls his car off to the side and is able to successfully get behind Leo and Yori. Jack comes over the Walkie one more time.

Jack: All good on the other side?

Mace: Yep, all good.

Jack: Alright let’s get goin’. 

As Jack kicks the Jeep back into gear, I hear all the other truck’s including the semi truck, start their engines in unison. As the Jeep roars to life, we pull off down the road, expanding our convoys wheels wherever the wheels themselves can take us. As we end the the turn to get off of Hwy 6, we quickly enter a deep thickened forest just outside the town of Magnolia Springs. It’s a beautiful forest I must add, especially with the Fall season upon the US at this point, meaning the trees start to look like hands in the wind with no leaves. Quickly we move past these trees into a wide expanse of open terrain. And as we past through this certain area Jack starts to speak through the Walkie.

Jack: We’re comin’ up on the first gate here, it’s safe for the most part, but once we reach gate 2 you’ll have the choice to get out and walk back, unless anyone wants to leave with you. Just a quick heads up; Be careful out there.

As he finishes his speech about the gates, everyone responds with a different variation of “ok”. Soon he goes back into the silence of his own car and makes a statement towards me.

Jack: Look, if you wanna skip out on this and turn around before the second gate, I get it, but if you want somethin’ for your station… I firmly suggest you stick along.

He gave an ultimatum, one that I ultimately, wasn’t very happy with. But one that presented me with the choice of getting to the bottom of the road and ultimately… finding Gordon.

Kay: I wouldn’t skip out that early in. I’m here to report on the full thing after all.

Jack: Good; I’ll be glad to read this report on the stations page when we’re done.

As we slowly drive through the opening in the forest I can see what seems to be the first gate of the roads expanse. Soon enough, we pull up close enough for me to tell. The gate reads “Purgatory Gates. 1/9.”

Kay: What does it mean by “Purgatory Gates”?

Jack: That ain’t normally there, probably just some teens lookin’ to mess with the people goin’ through here.

The words left his voice with a slight sincerity, almost convincing me his claim was true, even if it had no merit. As we successfully maneuver our way through the first gate, nothing seems to change. Cynically, I don’t know what I was expecting. I guess I was simply surprised that with something that had as much build up as this , that it would be an astronomical change from what was in front of the gate. But no, everything seemed to be the same as it was before the gate. But as my thought finishes Jack enters on the Walkie.

Jack: The next gate is 4 hours from now, so be ready to drive for awhile, and be ready for if and when I come through on the Walkie.

As we drive along the straight dirt road, I can feel a sense of uncertainty, almost as if the fact that I have no idea what’s  going on and where I’m going is weighing down on me as a threat. I quickly disregard the thought when Mace comes on the Walkie.

Mace: Hey Jack… was that gate back there supposed to close behind us?

Jack: What d’ya mean? 

Mace: Well I was just looking in my rear view and I notice that the gate was slammed shut. No one was there right?

Jack: There normally ain’t anybody at the first gate… Alright, everybody stay on lookout for anything and everything. If you see somethin’ report over the Walkie immediately.

Kay: What’s going on?

Jack: That gate isn’t supposed to close, it’s meant to stay open so the people can backtrack.

Kay: Well like you said, probably just some teens.

Jack: No no no no, the gate doesn’t allow teens in here. It simply isn’t possible. That’s why there was that graffiti on the front of the gate and there was nothing on the other side.

Kay: Maybe an adult trying to mess with us?

Jack didn’t respond this time, he kept a low hum on his voice and would intentionally murmur and break the synchronized sound he was making. I thought it was as simple as an immature adult wanting to make a little light out of this dark trail. Of course that was my cynical nature, but if what Mace was saying is true; that he saw nobody and there was nobody, then that notion may be put to rest.

Jack: Anyone seen anything?

Jay: Nah man, all clear here.

Forest: Here too.

Mace: Haven’t gotten any leads, nothin’ seems to be back here.

Alice: I saw something in the trees.

Alice’s words ring out to the entire convoy threatening a slight scream as I can hear from Tulip.

Jack: Tell me what you saw.

Alice: Looked like something hanging from a branch on the tree. It had a humanoid form but something felt… off.

Jack: That shouldn’t have happened. Could you make out any details on him?

Alice: He was missing a leg, looked like nature took his body over at that point.

Jack: Alright everybody make sure you have enough fuel ‘cause we’re gonna be goin’ just a little faster to the second gate. I’d recommend going up to 65 just in case. Also we’re a straight way here, so don’t worry about turning. Just drive.

As the words are uttered from the chassis of the wrangler, through the speaker of the Walkie, and into everyone’s cars, everybody collectively speeds up to 65 as Jack said. Not wanting to miss out on what could be a big leap in the story, I look out of my window into the rear view mirror and ask Jack, “What’s that?”

Jack: What’s what?

I look over at him and he meets my gaze.

Kay: The thing on the side of the road.

I tremble in my seat, the sight of what I’m praying at this point is nothing but a hallucination weighing on my sanity. There, on the side of the road, was the body of a young child, couldn’t have been anymore than 4-5 years old, and it was clearly deceased, and by the looks of it’s upright arm, it had already entered Rigor Mortis. But most peculiar, it was missing a leg. As I relay this information to Jack he turns back to me and just stares at me. Bereft of his vocals I assume, I ask if he’s okay.

Kay: Are you okay sir?

This appears to snap him out of his undead like trance, he turns his head back to the road and continues driving like nothing ever happened. For the next 2 and a half hours, Jack would continually stare at the road without chiming in once on the Walkie. Any attempt at conversation would lead to a pleasant yet curt response from the man. He wasn’t being rude or dismissive, he just had his mind somewhere else. And for my own journalistic sake, I wish I saw where that “somewhere” was. Finally, almost as if he came back to his roots, he picks up the Walkie transceiver and begins to speak.

Jack: We’re now just an hour away from the 2nd gate. If you wanna turn back, do it now. But after what happened back there I wouldn’t necessarily recommend it. Also, we’ll be making our first stop right after we cross the second gate. There’s an old store up there that allows overnight guest so we’ll call it there for today since the road gets a little more violent at noon and nighttime. Tomorrow, we won’t have that privilege.

As the Jeep every so steadily rolls away defiantly from what was conceived in the first gate, I start to fear that the trip may be more dangerous than Jack led on. Jack comes on the Walkie once again.

Jack: 10 minutes away from gate 2.

Soon enough, we roll up on another opening in the forest floor. I didn’t think about it much but the entirety of the of gate 1 was entirely forest. Not a single mishap in the trees throughout the entire first gate. But as we roll up to gate two, as much as I anticipated it, it still seems unreal. It reads “Purgatory Gates 2/9”. Strangely enough, the forest ground begins to turn to a fine sand beyond the gate, giving way to a bright desert of nothing but sun and minuscule rocks. As our 14 man quartet traverses the road, getting closer to the gate, Jack comes over the Walkie.

Jack: Alright, if anybody wants to leave and go back, pull off to the side of the road.
Jack: And I’m gonna ask you one more time; do you still wanna leave?

As Jack looks out of his rear view, me in his peripheral vision, he sees that no one pulls off. So, he ultimately pulled his gaze over to me. 

Jack: So?

Kay: Let’s keep it going.

The Jeep pulls off to finally pass the threshold of what we conceive as gate 2. As Mace makes his way past, Jack takes his gaze off of the rear view and puts it back onto the road.

Jack: We’re comin’ up on a few turns here, make sure to follow my car and when the fog sets in, just follow my rear lights. Do not get out of your car I repeat, do NOT get out of your car. And to be safe, roll up your windows.  

Jay: Fog?

Jack: Yeah, the fog will sent in and trust me you don’t wanna know what happens when you set foot in that low hanging cloud. Also it’ll cut all radio communications so be ready for complete radio silence.

Jay: You got my word.

As Jay ends his sentence, a heavy layer of fog begins to set foot over the ground of what is now the desert terrain.

Jack: I know what you’re thinkin’. You’re thinkin’ that this is some story, same as Mace.

Kay: Are you disappointed by that?

Jack: No no, I’d probably be surprised if you weren’t thinkin’ somethin’ like that.

Kay: Well you’ll certainly know how I feel after I publish this report.

Jack sits in his own unbearable silence almost as in protest to my remark. 20 minutes later, Jack comes back on the Walkie.

Jack: You’ve all been following great so far I presume?

A yes from each car rings out through the Walkie Transceiver.

Jack: Alright good. And for that I have excellent news; we’re comin’ up on the stop here in about 5 minutes. The fog’ll lift pretty close to the station so once it lifts, you’re safe to roll down your windows again.

As we slowly but surely disable our cars from the fog, I can feel a resounding sigh of relief come from all cars collectively. And my thought is especially modified when we seen the gas station 200 or so yards up ahead.

Jack: The station is right up here, so follow me into the back of it.

As we inch closer to the gas station I can hear a faint but audible scream come from the fog. I decide not to ask Jack about it as we were already so close to ending this day off, that I didn’t want to add another variable to the day. Ultimately, we pull in to the back of the gas station and while Jack goes to fill one of his jerrycans, Jay sparks up conversation with everyone around a premade fire that seemed to be there before we were. As we sit around joking and laughing about each others proclamations, and ultimately as the night winds down, we all start to tentatively notice ourselves get tired. Jay, as quickly as he started the discussion, ends it with a plain and simple, “I’m hittin’ the hay.” And collectively, everyone after that starts to go to bed. Eventually I pile into the back of the Wrangler onto the cot that Jack successfully made pretty comfortable. Now for me, I always loved going to bed with back ground noise. It was a necessity that I did. So I pulled out that radio that I had secretly piled into my bag and turned it to the clearest possible channel, 98.8 Big Springs Radio. The radio host, Trevor Goodall was playing 80s Rock ‘n Roll along with 90s Reggae music. Eventually at the end of a song fittingly named, “2 Minutes to Midnight” Trevor makes an appearance yet again.

Trevor Goodall: Trevor here but you can just call me Trev. Lately here in the town of Big Springs we have a spark of controversy coming with the new management of the local RV park. Please tell us what you think about the predicament as it’d be a pleasure to have you on the show. 

Trevor’s voice gets low and gaunt as he speaks the next haunting words.

Trevor Goodall: And for you listening, here’s some good songs from the 80s. This is a fun one.

As he finishes his sentence a wrenching cacophony of emerald bone crushing sounds fills the night air. Quickly I’m stammered as the sound of torture and pain reconcile within my ears. But as quickly as it started, it ended. And he presents himself again.

Trevor Goodall: My names Trevor Goodall, and I’m with you until the end of time.

Left in a state of shock, I can only count the good fortune I had to make sure the volume of the radio was on low. Quickly I turn the radio off and lay in bed to try and soothe my ears from the wretched sound that I was presented. Soon enough, I fall asleep under an intense amount of abject hysteria, that of which the likes of pierces my body.
