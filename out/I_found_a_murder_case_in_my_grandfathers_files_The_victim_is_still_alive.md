Wow. My last post got more attention than I expected. Honestly, I thought most people here would tear it apart or laugh at me. But a lot of you were surprisingly helpful. You can find my original post \[[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mc28uj/i_found_a_police_transcript_hidden_in_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\].

A few clarifications first:  
Yes, I *also* noticed the date—2027. That caught me off guard, but I initially assumed it was some kind of mistake. I had ruled out the idea that it was fanfiction or something my grandfather wrote himself, mainly because of how official the documents looked. There were seals, serial numbers, and what appeared to be genuine formatting consistent with law enforcement case files.

But after reading some of your replies… I don’t think it was a mistake anymore.

Also, some people pointed out that I described the video as black and white, but then mentioned red and blue police lights being visible. That’s on me. The surveillance footage was extremely dark. It *looked* black and white because the barn had no lighting, and it was recorded at night. The moment the police lights flooded the barn was the first time actual color appeared on the screen.

I promise you, I’m not lying. This is real. And I’m beginning to think it’s still happening. If anyone wants to see the documents for themselves, you can DM me. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to keep them.

Anyway. After that discovery, I decided to do some research. I looked into Cooper Johnson—the man murdered in the interview transcript, and I found something that made my blood run cold.

He’s still alive.  
As of today, he’s a welder living in Nebraska.

Detective James Davis, on the other hand, is harder to trace. I couldn’t find much on him at all. Nothing concrete. Which I guess makes sense if his work requires confidentiality. But the fact that *Cooper* is alive and still breathing in 2025, two years before the date on that video… I don’t know what to think.

Why did my grandfather have this?

Did he fake it?

Is he involved?

Should I warn Cooper?

I went back to my grandfather’s house a few days ago to look for more answers. I tore through every drawer, every file cabinet, every old folder. Most of it was normal, bills, taxes, medical records. The usual stuff. My grandfather was a good man. Or at least, he seemed like one. Always charming. Always had a story to tell. A little old-school, sure, but kind. The only remotely strange thing about him was his obsession with old war memorabilia. That and his fascination with ancient Greek culture.

But everyone has their quirks, right?

Eventually, I made my way to the attic. I hadn’t been up there since I was a kid. It was exactly as disgusting as I remembered, maybe worse. Dust clung to the air like fog. The peeling yellow wallpaper was curling at the corners. The floor creaked under every step. When I opened the attic door, the sound alone made cockroaches scatter across the wooden planks.

I started digging through boxes and crates, pushing aside old Christmas decorations and cracked photo frames. After about twenty minutes, I was startled by a spider dropping from a beam above me. I flinched and fell backwards.

But instead of hitting a solid wall, I crashed through it.

The drywall gave way like it was hollow, and I landed face-to-face with a Nazi uniform.

At first, I wasn’t too surprised. Like I said, he collected war artifacts. He kept that part of his collection out of sight, probably because of how taboo it is. Still, it felt... wrong. Off.

I dusted the uniform off and held it up.

It had a name tag.

His last name.

**Hess.**

I froze. I thought of the name again. Hess.  
Then I remembered a figure I had learned about years ago.  
**Rudolf Hess.** One of the highest-ranking officials in Hitler’s inner circle.  
A man obsessed with mysticism, prophecy, and strange disappearances.

It couldn’t be the same person. Right?

Right?

But why hide the uniform?

Why have it labeled with his *own* last name?

Why does *everything* about this feel orchestrated?

I wanted to keep searching. I really did. But the attic started to feel wrong. Not just musty or creepy. *Watched.* Like something was crouched just beyond my field of vision, holding its breath.

I backed out. Slowly. The feeling only got worse the longer I stayed. My skin was crawling. I heard something shift behind the insulation. Not scurry, *shift*. Heavy. Intentional.

I haven’t gone back up since.

I don’t like admitting this part. I want to believe I’m logical. Rational. But I’m starting to feel scared. Deeply scared.

So I’m asking again:

What should I do?

Should I try to warn Cooper Johnson?  
Would he even believe me?  
Would *anyone*?

Because I’m starting to believe this doesn’t just involve my grandfather.  
I think I was meant to find that document.  
I think I’m already part of the pattern.

And I think something knows.
