I don’t dream a lot, dreaming is often a luxury to me. However when I do dream, it’s often about real life, though there's something off. It’s been somewhat a reoccurring dream since my childhood, though it’s all different. You might be wondering, “How is this reoccurring if it’s all different”, but there’s something that’s always in my dreams that stays the same no matter what. I can’t move in my dreams.

My mom just chalks it up to sleep paralysis but I know it’s not. I’m not in the real world when this happens, I know that I’m dreaming. Sometimes the setting will be drastically different, a testing room, a castle, an exploitative boarding school. There’s always different people around me too. The problem is I’m asleep in my dreams, somewhat like the movie inception (I know it’s dumb to compare it to that and makes it sound like it’s fiction, but stay with me here). I can hear the people talking in my dreams, they’re always right beside me. I can’t move or speak, I’m completely asleep and I can’t wake up despite how much I try. I know I’ll be able to wake up if I move, but I can’t move, at all.

It’s terrifying, because I’ve been having these since I was eight, this has been happening for nine years exactly. I don’t know why it happens and it frankly terrifies me. Not because the fact that I can’t move, but the things that happen in my dreams along with it.

To help explain, there was this one dream I had when I was in elementary school. I can still remember it vividly. There were a set of twins who were celebrating a birthday, and they invited all of their friends. Though one of the twins was more popular that the other and she was extremely jealous because of it. They were extremely rich to the point where their shared room was a giant room with two life sized dollhouses in it. Three massive tables that were completely filled with treats that would probably put a grown man out of commission stood in the middle of the room, all separated equally from each other. 

The more popular twin (I had never gotten their names in the dream) was having the best time of her life, surrounded by her friends and oblivious to the brewing jealousy that filled her twin who was completely alone. 
The birthday party also doubled as a sleepover, so all the girls huddled up together in the middle of the room in their sleeping bags. The girl filled with hate and envy didn’t sleep though, she was alone and cold, her friends having grown to like her sister more than her.

(This next part is incredibly disturbing to me to
this day, so I won’t go into much detail. This dream already haunts me too much)

The girl stood up and walked over to the tables as everyone was sleeping, taking a straw from the juice box and using it to kill everyone there, leaving her sister for last (seriously, I dont know how you could possibly manage to kill someone with a straw). She went over to her sister who was still sleeping peacefully, not knowing the horrors that had occurred. Getting on top of her sister, she proceeded to stab her in the eye with the straw so hard that it took it out of the socket. And she just kept going, the straw soon covered in blood and brain matter. That’s where the dream ended. I was horrified when I woke up, I didn’t dare tell anyone. After all, how could you tell your mother that you had a dream about someone mass murdering her friends and family out of pure jealousy? 

The one thing that I still remember to this day was the look of the sister’s dead body, her eye still out of the socket staring at me, knowing that I couldn’t move. That I was forced to watch this dream at the grand age of eight. If you can get traumatized from a dream, I’m pretty sure that dream traumatized me for the rest of my life. 

Ever since then, I couldn’t move in my dreams, I couldn’t do anything. I was a bystander stuck in some kind of sleep paralysis in my own dream, I was simply an observer in those horrible happenings occurring in every dream I’ve had. From dreams of being forced to literally kill myself over and over in order to escape my situation to being asleep and unable to awake in a boarding school that killed kids that didn’t live up to their expectations. 

It was a cycle, everything was different, but one thing. And every time I woke up, I had always gone to my mom for comfort, though I never told her the real content of my dreams, just coming up with the same lie every time. “I had a dream that you weren’t there to help me”. Her comfort was enough for me, even though she didn’t know the true things my mind had subjected me to. It honestly feels like my mind is running run the gauntlet with me, but I can’t close out, no medicine fixes it. I’m stuck in the hell my mind created for me.

What’s really terrifying to me is that I can sometimes see that girl when I’m going about my day to day life. I honestly think it’s stress since I’m juggling work and AP Classes and my senior year in highschool all at the same time. My mom doesn’t listen to me when I tell her, she thinks I’m just lying about my dreams because there’s no possibility that I can have sleep paralysis during my dreams according to her. 

I've honestly been considering going to a dream interpreter, or maybe really a therapist at this point. I’ll update this when I do go
