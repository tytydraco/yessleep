I think the worst part about all this is that I don’t drive.

The first time it happened was a few years ago. I spent the weekend at my friend’s house, a very common event at that time. Usually I would take the train home from his place, but he wanted to drive me home that night. He always made driving feel like such a romantic thing, romantic in the classical sense. Just freedom and exploration, sightseeing and road trips. Very Southern Californian. That night, driving through the mountains with my friend, I would have wanted nothing more than to get behind the wheel and cruise forever and ever.

Something else about my friend is that he’s very particular about the way he drives. Rather, he’s very particular about the way I act in the passenger seat when he drives. How to give directions, checking if turns are clear, looking for parking spaces. We argued once about whether I should tell him what exit to take by the street name or the exit number when I was giving directions. (The exit number just makes sense to me, numbers are harder to mix up than street names).  When he got off the freeway in the middle of nowhere that night, at least a half hour away from where I lived, it made some kind of sense for him to blame me for it.

“What are you doing, man?” He grumbled at me.

“Me? You’re the one driving.” I couldn’t tell where we were, but I wouldn’t have. It was dark, and like I said, I don’t drive. No sense of direction really. “How is it my fault?”

“Whatever man.” He turned off the exit onto the surface road. There were no buildings anywhere around. Just a long stretch of asphalt road with cars parked on either side. “How do I get back on the freeway?”

“We could just back up.” I joked. He didn’t appreciate it.

He drove for a while, waiting to find somewhere to turn to find the on-ramp. He turned around and tried the opposite direction from the exit. After driving the other way for nearly ten full minutes, he realized something. I’ve never heard him this scared before or since.

“The exit. It’s… gone.” He breathed out the words almost too quiet for me to hear.

“Gone?” I look out the windows all around us, as if I was going to see a freeway exit that he missed. “Are we on the same road?”

“There’s only one road here.” I could hear his breathing now. “Fuck. The freeway. Where’s the freeway? Wasn’t it on our left?”

“I thought it was on our right.” I looked around again, more as a comforting motion than anything.

“Fuck man, will you pay attention?” He was getting more frustrated, and I was getting more scared.

He was right. This road should be close enough that we should be able to see the freeway. The speeding cars and their headlights passing by. We should at least be able to hear it, that oddly calming soft sound. Like a river of cars. But it was quiet. I rolled down my window, still nothing. I looked closer at the cars parked on the side of this seemingly endless road. There was nothing around, not even a freeway apparently. Where did all these cars come from anyway? Nobody was in any of the cars, nobody was standing outside them waiting for a tow truck. Just a bunch of empty old cars. Really old cars. I’m not a big car guy, but these are the kind of cars my brothers would nerd out about if we saw one on the road. Rattling off brand names or makes and models. I tried to make out one of the license plates when I was blinded by a bright light.

“Gah, fuck!” My friend was hit by it too. I heard our car screech to a halt. I was glad he was still calm enough to stop moving while he couldn’t see. “What the fuck?”

My eyes adjusted to the light, it looked like the sun came back out for a second. I blinked my eyes open finally. It was the cars. All the cars parked on this old endless road, every single one of these old abandoned cars had their lights on now.

Some things about that night have blurred in my memory. I don’t remember how my friend got off that road, I don’t remember when we found the freeway. I don’t remember getting out of his car, walking into my house, and falling asleep in my bed hours later than I should have. If either of us said anything to each other for the rest of that night, I don’t remember it. Of all the things I forgot from that night, I wish to God I didn’t remember the thought that ran through my head when all those lights turned on. A thought that hit me in my bones as true. Something deep down in the animal brain that takes over during in a life or death situation, when you body needs you to know something to keep itself alive.
