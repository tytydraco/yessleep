Rickety cabins in the Alaskan wilderness are a dime-a-dozen. Hardly cause for alarm. That said, six months ago, there was just *one* new cabin.

A month later, I spotted three on our bootlegging route.

Then five.

Then eight, all identical-lookin’ on a cursory inspection.

From there, I lost track, so I stopped counting. I’d just drive on by and try not to dwell.

Eventually, though, I couldn’t ignore it: they truly appeared to be multiplyin’. What's worse, they were *never* in the same place twice.

If there was one nestled between a creek-bed and a cliff-face in September, it wouldn’t be there in October, and as time passed, there seemed to be more of them earlier in our route, almost as if they were migrating.

A flock of large wooden animals marchin’ south for the winter.

Before the crash, before we *really* got to bear witness to their infernal nature close-up, Ray and I were just a pair of miserable old coots gathering dust at some sticky bar-top in downtown Anchorage.

Nothing like a little legal booze to celebrate another successful delivery of some extrajudicial booze.

We sipped lager in silence, attention glued to the small TV hanging above the liquor shelf. Not sure where Yuka had wandered off to. Young blood was probably chasin’ tail.

The Astros were losin’ to the Red Sox. Grumbling, I averted my eyes from the grainy feed. They wandered through the bar a bit, aimless, but eventually landed on some missing person flyers strung across the wall between a pair of brightly flashing pinball machines. They weren’t just for one person. I counted seven or eight different faces amongst the tragic collage.

Something baleful began to churn in my stomach just from lookin’ at the flyers, but I tried to reassure myself.

It’s Alaska.

People go missing all the time in Alaska.

Then, out of the blue, I asked Ray if he’d noticed the cabins.

He looked at me funny - head cocked, frost-blue eyes narrowing - and my fears just sort of leaked out. I’ve suffered food poisoning with ten times the grace compared to how I spilled my guts that night.

When I was done, he slammed his glass down and turned forward, swivel-stool squeaking under his considerable weight.

*“Awh hell Bill, sixty’s a little late to be catching superstition, no? Your brain must be gettin' soft.”*

I lifted my beer and clinked the rim against his.

*“Cheers to that,”* I muttered, raising my glass. Finished the last quarter of my drink in a single hearty gulp, the taste of caramel and fermentation slithering over my tongue.

*“Oh don’t be sensitive. Just… I don’t know, think about it rationally, Bill. The woods all look the same blustering through the wilderness on a snowmobile. You’re probably just forgettin’ which cabins are located where.”*

I shrugged.

It was a logical explanation, but, according to the Natives, those woods were known to resist logic’s calming inertia every so often. Water sliding off a beaver’s back without its skin gettin' wet.

*“Really don’t think I’m forgettin’ anything, Ray..”*

Not sure the old bastard heard me. As the words left my mouth, he spun around - scanning the pool tables, the bathroom line, the pinball machines - before returning forward with a sigh, locks of brittle white hair dancing over his shoulders.

*“Remind me to inform Yuka - wherever the fuck he is - that I’m prohibitin’ you from his ilk’s damn campfire stories for the foreseeable future. Nonsense is making your head loopy.”*

And that was that. I dropped the matter, and we resumed drinkin’.

Two weeks later, we’d be departing from Anchorage on what would turn out to be our last run.

I’m sure Ray’s right flustered in hell.

The only thing he hated more than being wrong was listening to another rendition of the legends, and I’m about to make him the poster child of one.

Because whatever *this* is - the walking cabins and the devils that stole my confederates -

it’s a new legend.

\- - - - -

For the blissfully uninitiated, yes - prohibition is still alive and well in some parts of the US, though there ain’t much money in bootlegging most places.

Any idiot with a working car and a touch of criminality can illegally transport bottom-shelf vodka across certain county lines and demand a higher profit for the risk they incurred, but it’s a hard sell.

Ain’t that simple for our customers, though.

They call them *dry villages* in Alaska.

Can be treacherous to cross in and out of dry villages during the winter, what with the apocalyptic snowfall, and the rampant permafrost, and the meager hours of sunlight available per day. That danger allowed us to market wares with a fairly generous markup. A twenty-five dollar bottle of *Red Label* we’d purchase at an Alaskan liquor store would be worth *two hundred* dollars by the time we reached a dry village.

It’s unsavory work. I ain’t denyin’ it. Nor am I tryin’ to justify my part in supplying alcohol to a community that’s been rocked by its barbaric wiles, time and time again.

Put simply, smuggling is all I’ve ever done, and I *know* running alcohol is better than trafficking opioids from Colombia to El Paso, morally speaking.

So when Ray proposed we abandon the cartel and move north to start our own modest operation in Alaska, I jumped at the chance. Wouldn’t say I’m a strong candidate for sainthood, but even my small, stiff heart could only tolerate peddling death for so long.

I’ve slept much more soundly since we left Texas.

This last week’s been different, though. Don’t think I’ve caught a wink the whole damn time.

I can’t stop thinking about what they did to Ray,

and wherever he is, I don’t believe he’s sleeping either.

‘Suppose there’s some solidarity in that.

\- - - - -

The crash was over and done with in the blink of an eye.

Yuka was leadin’, and he should’ve been going slower. Ain’t all his fault, though.

Ray was driving too close to him.

Typically, Ray would lead. He preferred it. According to him, seniority gave his preference the most weight.

As we were preparing to ship off earlier that morning, however, Yuka planted a wide, capricious grin over his jaw, hopped on his snowmobile, and zoomed ahead of the both of us. Ray’s knee was actin’ up, so he was digging through the cargo at that moment, lookin’ for a misplaced bottle of aspirin. Boy caught him with his metaphorical pants down.

That man was not one to suffer such indignities.

His face flushed bright cherry red. He discharged some expletives that I’d rather not reiterate here. Then, he lumbered onto his own snowmobile, and gave chase.

Don’t think he ever found the painkiller.

He then spent the next two hours futilely trying to overtake the boy, dead set on resuming his proper place at the front of the pack. Just another event in a long line of pissing contests between the two man-shaped children.

As we cusped into the final third of our trek, it happened.

Had about an hour of sunlight left. We were heavy with cargo, full cases of liquor drifting behind each snowmobile on detachable sleds. Made sudden changes in direction nearly impossible.

Without warning, Yuka veered right.

A sharp, spastic turn that likely would’ve sent him into a barrel-roll by itself, made all the worse by the fact that the boy’s cargo sled became latched to the snout of Ray’s snowmobile as he turned.

I slammed on the brakes and skidded to a halt.

Helplessly, I watched as ice and velocity and momentum melded together to create something deathly - a shuddering, metallic centipede with four writhing segments that looked desperate to be free of each other.

Yuka’s snowmobile rolled.

The boy made himself into a ball - head down, knees to his chest - and fell from the vehicle on its first rotation. The noise of crunching metal, tearing plastic, and shattering glass rang through the otherwise silent tundra. Spilled liquor painted nearby snow the color of dirt-stained pennies.

Ray’s snowmobile continued on for a moment. Then, his forward motion and Yuka’s abrupt turn reconciled.

Whiplash sent the stubborn bastard flying from his seat. His vehicle tumbled onto its side in the same direction. It landed against the frozen earth with a resounding *thud*, accented by a whining crackle.

His calve had been caught beneath the snowmobile as it bounced off the ground.

Ray’s wails followed.

Both snowmobiles slid to a stop.

The wreck settled. No more gnawing metal or twisting plastic. All that remained was the low, mechanical gurgle of my snowmobile’s engine, Ray’s vacillating shrieks, and the Alaskan wind whistling through the snowdrifts, mocking us.

Trembling, Yuka stood.

He surveyed himself head to toe. Looked right surprised at his continued physical integrity. My gaze drifted over his shoulders. Behind him, I saw the sun flirting with the horizon, threatening night.

And up a small slope, huddled amidst a cluster of snow-dappled pines,

There was a cabin.

\- - - - -

It didn’t take much convincin’ to get me trudging up that hill.

First, though, we regrouped at Ray’s side.

The boy was profusely apologetic. That was before he saw the sorry state of the man’s leg, too.

Now, I ain't no Hemmingway, but I am perfectly capable of paintin’ a pretty picture of Ray’s mangled appendage. However, I’m choosing to defer the more gruesome details. Ain’t pertinent to the story. Plus, there’s other, prettier pictures I plan on paintin', and describing *those* hellscapes actually serves a purpose beyond willful grotesquery.

So, moving past the shock and the horror, Yuka and I got to work.

Poured half a bottle of our highest-proof spirit on the wounds, then gave him the rest to drink, which he chugged. Then, we splinted the calf bones using some gnarled sticks and a few scraps of cloth. Meanwhile, Ray was howlin’ at Yuka, berating the kid senseless, and he just took it, panic-stricken and bleary-eyed.

All he had to say in his defense was:

*“I saw someone…back there…eyes peekin’ over the tree. Thought they was gonna jump out.”*

Slightly unnerved, I turned away from them and surveyed the crash site.

Dusk had begun to mask the scenery. I pulled a flashlight from my rucksack, flicked it on, and walked a few yards forward, thick snow crunching under my boots. I dragged the bright white halo across the horizon. All I saw were two slim spruces wavering ominously in the wind.

Boy was in shock, I figured. Seeing things that weren’t actually there.

I was surprised to find Ray had softened by the time I got back. Caught him apologizing for riding Yuka’s ass, acknowledging his part in the crash between moans of breathless pain.

Wasn’t like him to give *anyone* slack, let alone the kid.

Could have been high on the endorphins, could have been a faint glimmer of the bastard's withered humanity leaking through his broken exterior, but, truthfully, I think it was the setting sun that made him soft. Night was falling, dropping blanket after blanket of black satin over the desolate landscape, and he didn’t feel safe potentially dyin’ an asshole.

Don’t want to be turned away from the pearly gates just for sayin’ a few nasty things you didn’t really mean.

We pulled our whimpering, slightly drunk comrade away from the crash and set him at the base of the sloping hill, up against the hull of a massive pine tree. The only snowmobile that was still running was my own, so I proposed I’d travel to the nearest dry village for help, with Yuka stayin’ behind.

Ray expressed a vehement distaste for that plan.

*“First off, nearest village is an hour away, and it’s gonna be pitch-black out here before I even finish this sentence. But let’s say you do manage to get there safe - you wanna explain to the authorities why we out here? Dead's better than jail. Always.”*

My gaze crept over to Yuka. Even in the dim light, I could tell his skin was moon-pale, his brown eyes fixed vacantly on Ray’s decimated foot.

There was a brief silence, empty of Ray’s previously labored breathing, empty of the mocking wind, empty of everything.

A harrowing vacuum of noise.

Then,

*“I saw a cabin up the hill* \- ” Yuka muttered.

*“Y’know, I did as well,”* Ray chimed, slurring his words, “*Looked abandoned to me, but how ‘bout y’all go see if anyone’s home. I’ll start pitchin’ a fire in the meantime. Worse comes to worst, we’ll rough it out here for the night, but I have a feelin’ that won’t be necessary.”*

I felt my stomach pirouette. Hot bile lapped against the back of my tongue. I wanted to protest, but a misplaced belief in the humdrum rationality of this world kept my lips sealed tight.

*It’s just a cabin* \- I told myself.

*“Fine,”* I replied, *“we’ll leave you with some kindling and a lighter.”*

Before Yuka and I started up the incline, I asked him one more thing.

*“What if it ain’t abandoned, Ray, and if so, what if they ain’t so keen on helpin’ us?”*

He chuckled, snapping the lighter on and placing the smoldering flame under his chin.

*“Haven’t you heard? People go missing in Alaska all the time, Bill.”*

*- - - - -*  
The cabin resided in a circular clearing three minutes up the hill.

It was a squat, unremarkable building. No porch, no overhanging roof, no stairs leadin’ up to a stoop. Just a small rectangular box with an unlabeled door and a single, front-facing window. Couldn’t see a damn thing through the glass. From what I could tell, seemed like the darkness inside nearly matched the dark brown bark the cabin was made from.

Yuka, once again, was leadin’.

The closer we got, the slower I moved. The boy maintained a steady forward pace, headstrong to his dyin’ breath.

*“Hold on a second,”* I whispered.

I jogged to catch up and placed my hand on his shoulder. Tried to pull him back.

*“Ain’t no time for pussyfooting, Bill.”* he snipped, shrugging me off.

Irritated, I let him go. Crouched down behind a snowdrift and watched him approach. Alarm bells the size of SUVs were sounding in my skull, but I couldn’t exactly pinpoint *why*.

The last murmurs of sunlight were beginning to dissipate above our heads.

He was only a few steps away from the door when I noticed it.

Didn’t believe my eyes at first, because it made no earthly sense. I angled my head. Twisted my neck side to side, but the observation did not change.

There was a narrow strip of reflective fabric on Yuka’s coat, running over his shoulders. Fleeting sunlight glinted off the material. As expected, the glint moved across the fabric when I moved my eyes.

The window was in line with his shoulders. It should’ve reflected light too.

But it didn't.

Almost as if it wasn't a window at all.

Just the portrait of a window, sketched across the cabin’s exterior.

Yuka reached for the knob.

Against my better judgement, I shot up from the snowdrift.

***“Boy, get the hell back here!”*** I bellowed.

He turned to look, but it was too late.

The tip of his ring finger made contact with the cabin door.

His hand retracted violently. He muffled a yelp, waving his palm in the air like he’d sustained a burn, like his fingers had grazed the edge of a sizzling grill.

Behind him, the cabin started to come alive.

Shrill creaking echoed through the clearing as the cold wood creased and rippled. Boils the size of footballs popped from its surface, only to disappear a second later.

I couldn’t seem to look away.

The squeaking *thumps* of someone sprinting through half-frozen snow swelled in my ears, and yet I still couldn’t peel myself from the spectacle. As the sky turned black, the cabin writhed, bowing in some places, inflating in others - a shipping container sized lump of bark-colored clay kneading under the monstrous, unseen hands of God.

Yuka grabbed my wrist as he passed by. Damn near dislocated it, not to imply I ain’t thankful.

Don’t think I would’ve left if he didn’t kick-start me.

We stumbled down the incline. Pine needles clawed at my face. My diaphragm wheezed like a weathered bagpipe.

Eventually, the flickers of a newborn fire brought us right back to Ray.

*“What the fuck happened up there?!”* he croaked.

Yuka fell to the ground, tearing at the gloved hand that’d touched the cabin’s doorknob, moanin' in agony. I knelt next to him. Helped him get the garment off. His eyes were wild. The vessels in his neck were throbbing.

With my assistance, we finally revealed skin.

His ring finger was tense with hot fluid. In only a few minutes, the digit had turned elderberry-purple and was swollen to the size of a Cuban cigar.

There was something slender sticking out of the inflamed digit.

His wrist trembled. Yuka saw it too.

*“What…w-what is it?”* he whispered.

I brought my eyes closer, tryin' to determine what’d pierced his flesh. Behind us, Ray continued jabbering.

*“Anyone gonna enlighten me regarding this new crisis?”*

My head flew over my shoulder, and I looked him dead in the eyes.

*“Jesus Christ, Ray - Hush.”*

His brows leapt across his forehead, mouth slightly agape. He was startled, maybe enraged, but he obliged and closed his damn jaw. I turned myself back to a whimpering, terror-struck Yuka.

Gently, I angled his hand towards the bristling fire. Finally got a good look at it.

*“It’s…a splinter."* I muttered.

Ray scoffed.

*“Good Lord, kid’s havin’ a conniption over a measly splinter…”*

The shard of wood squirmed. Then, in one serpentine motion, it buried itself under Yuka’s skin.

A war drum erupted inside my chest.

*“Ain’t no regular splinter, Ray.”*

I perked my ears.

Yuka’s eyes darted over his shoulders.

The sound of creaking wood was emanating from the darkness of the slope. Multiple instances of it at varying pitches and volumes, but each was noticeably rhythmic, chugging along at a steady pace.

***Creeeaaaaaaak***\*, pause.\* ***Creaaaaaaaaak***\*, pause.\*

And they were all getting louder.

*“We need to go.”* I whispered.

Ray nodded.

Yuka gave no indication that he heard me.

The boy had stopped whimpering.

In the fire’s shimmering orange glow, I could tell that his whole hand had become swollen, and that he was staring at Ray with a look of hunger behind his eyes.

Should’ve known he was a deadman walkin’, right then and there.

I considered shootin’ him.

God’s honest, I did. My sidearm wasn’t far. Doubt Ray would’ve given me too much flack for being overly cautious.

In the end, I deferred.

Convinced myself that it was all in my head.

Quietly, I asked Yuka to help Ray onto one of the sleds, figurin’ we could tow him away from whatever was descending the slope.

That was a mistake.

I should’ve killed him.

Guess I couldn’t stomach the thought of breakin' a promise, though.

\- - - - -

I’ve spent the better part of the last decade with the Native peoples.

Broken bread with them. Fished halibut out of the Yukon with them. Even fell cross-eyed lovesick over one of them a while back.

As a bootlegger, though, I’d wager most of my time spent with the locals has involved drinkin’.

Plying my trade necessitated a sort of performative self-indulgence. It built my clientele.

Amongst my regular customers, there was always a few undetermined souls. Kids that wouldn’t imbibe, but wouldn’t tattle to the authorities, neither.

Those lukewarm naysayers were the ones I’d be drinkin’ for.

I’d flaunt my charisma. Shaked my proverbial tail feathers while pickling my innards in hooch. If I sung loud enough, and if I danced well enough, those formerly undetermined souls would be placing an order for our next clandestine delivery before I stumbled out the door.

Yuka was one of those converts.

The only child of the woman I’d fallen in love with, matter of fact.

Got to know him well over the years. Boy was plucky. Resourceful. Slugged more than a few wet-blankets at Ray’s behest. He looked up to the both of us, apparently. Was aspiring to get our attention for a long while.

One night, Ray asked him if he’d like to join our little operation. Didn't clue me in on said proposal beforehand.

The boy's eyes lit up, but he quickly steadied his expression, masking his elation. Unbecoming of a man to display such excitement.

His mother was furious.

In no uncertain terms, she informed me that if I took him in, tarnished his spirit with our unsavory ways, that we were through.

With a heavy heart, I explained to her that it was Yuka’s decision. Wasn’t my place to intervene.

So, we parted ways.

A few days later, she called me up. Made me promise to keep him safe.

I promised I would.

Think that was the first and only time I lied to her.

Ain’t no leaving this particular type of life unscathed.

In a grand, cosmic sense, her son had been dead for some time.

He died the second I arrived at his home.

Choked out his last breath when he peered up at me and saw something worthwhile.

\- - - - -

I raced over to my snowmobile. The noises emanating from the darkened hill grew louder.

***Creaaaaaaaaak***\*, pause.\*

***Creaaaaaaaaak***\*, pause.\*

***Creaaaaaaaaak***\*, pause.\*

Shoved the key into the ignition and twisted hard. The engine growled. I jumped on and drove it around, parking the attached sled in front of Ray.

All the while, Yuka hadn’t budged an inch.

He was still just loomin’ above the fire, staring at the injured man posted against the pine tree. The swelling had reached his elbow. His forearm had tripled in size. The raw pressure of the accumulating fluid had misaligned his fingers. His middle and ring fingers were crossed in the shape of an X. His thumb was pointin’ backwards, hitchhiking towards his chest.

I took the key out, stepped off the bike, and crept towards them, palms out to show Yuka I meant no harm.

In the meantime, Ray was becoming volatile.

*“Son, what the hell you gawkin’ at?”*

In a swift, jerky motion, the boy leaned in. Ray pushed himself back with the balls of his hands, grimacing as his mangled foot knocked into the cold dirt.

*“W-what the fuck is wrong with your arm?”* he asked.

Each of my movements was small and deliberate. I reached out to Ray.

Yuka stilled.

I felt Ray’s fingers land across my palm.

Suddenly, the boy’s leg shot sideways, launching a clump of snow into the smoldering fire.

Its glow whimpered, waned, and then gave out completely.

Blackness surrounded us.

The beginning of the end.

There was a soft *pop* as the seams of Yuka’s skin split.

His hand wept, drizzling viscous tears onto Ray’s parka.

Starting at the tip of ring finger, Yuka’s flesh peeled away in four long, equally sized flaps, dainty and lush, blood petals in vibrant bloom. Strips of limp, fatty skin fell into the snow, castin’ the limb in a steaming mist.

I could barely appreciate the muscle and bone that remained beneath the seething mess of chaotic motion.

Thousands of crystalline splinters skittered like starving termites over his arm. Half brown, half white, each about the length of a sewing needle but thinner. They labored, skewerin’ muscle and tendon, organizing themselves with a near-robotic precision into tightly-packed, fanning lines, one after the other, always with the brown half facing forward. Once organized, they stilled.

Ray dug his nails into my palm.

He discharged a wild scream.

Yuka’s body continued to unzip. The splinter’s autonomous, rank-and-file self-arrangement followed only a few inches behind.

Once the shedding reached his collarbone, he took a tiny, shivering step.

All of the skin, from his skull to his toes, puckered, stretched, and then abandoned him completely with another, more climactic *pop*.

And a bark-scaled devil emerged.

Yuka's skin lay in molted tatters at its feet.

I tried to pull my friend away.

It was quicker.

The devil's hand latched itself onto Ray’s face. Its palm churned with fractal movement. Blood dripped heavy down his chin. The muffled screams grew shrill and animalistic.

Nothin’ to be done at that point.

I yanked my hand from his, fingernails clawing jagged tracks across my wrist, and sprinted to the snowmobile.

It grumbled to life.

I flicked on the headlights and swung around, readying to launch myself in the direction opposite the slope. I dragged the light across them in the process.

The devil shot up at an unnatural, nausea-inducing speed, arms flipped forward and facing me. Ray flopped lifelessly into the snow. Before the edge of the beam passed them, I paused the turn, and watched.

The devil stayed perfectly still. Looked like a cardboard cutout that was missing a person’s picture.

Slowly, I slid clockwise.

They shifted to counter the motion with a few awkward, creaking stomps.

I let the engine sit, rumbling.

No movement.

Ten seconds. Twenty seconds.

I slammed the wheel to the left, hoping to catch them off guard.

They moved to keep the light shining on their front, but a few shimmers managed to touch their back, which was diffusely chalk-white and seemed fleshy in comparison.

A furious clicking sound radiated from the devil. Not from their mouth, but their entire body. Their version of a scream, I’d reckon. Some of the white flesh turned ash-gray, like it'd been burnt.

They were trying to protect the white half of the splinters from the light.

I idled for a moment, thinking.

Then, I heard it again.

***Creaaaaaaaaak***\*, pause.\*

I flicked on the high beams, illuminating the slope in a hazy glow.

A dozen more devils were littered across the incline, each still as a statue in the exact same pose, and the cabin was conspicuously missing from the top of the hill.

That’s when it hit me.

The cabin wasn’t missing, not really.

They *were* the cabin.

From the nearby snow, another devil began to appear, unfurling from Ray’s corpse. Just half of a face to start, but I’m confident more was coming.

I pivoted and began driving away.

As I turned, thirteen and a quarter devils turned as well, creaking together in perfect unison,

and despite my best efforts,

I can’t get that goddamned image out of my head.

\- - - - - -

Saw another one on my way back.

It was planted in the middle of an otherwise empty field, only fifteen minutes from the outskirts of Anchorage. Closest I’ve ever seen one come.

On a whim, I decided to test a few things, but only because it felt safe to do so.

The sunlight that morning was radiant and unfettered, not a single cloud in the sky.

First, I tried to set the contemptible amalgamation ablaze. I had the booze, the lighter, and a few bits of flammable cloth. Figured I might as well.

I lobbed the blazing cocktail at the cabin, the promise of vengeance swirling in my gut. It shattered against the poor excuse for a window with a brilliant explosion.

But it would not catch.

Four firebombs later, and still, nothing.

Despite mimicking a wooden structure, the splinters don’t seem to share its chemical weaknesses. Makes me wonder if calling them *splinters* is misleading. A problem for someone smarter than me to dissect, no doubt.

Next, I parked my snowmobile *real* close, about a foot away, and I flicked the high beams on. Wanted to see if additional light could damage it.

They didn’t react: no undulating, no clicking.

Dumb hypothesis, but, if it wasn’t already abundantly clear, I ain’t no scientist.

My last test was the most perilous of the three.

It was also the most important.

I positioned myself a safe distance away from the cabin, made sure my snowmobile was good on gasoline, turned the lights on, and waited for the sun to set.

For a full hour of moonless night, they did not move. With my light on them, they remained a cabin, interlocked and benign.

I took as deep a breath as I could muster and flicked the lights off.

Didn’t have to wait long.

Within seconds, the structure was twistin' in on itself. The decomposition was more ferocious that time around, like they were angry.

And that made me smile.

A head with a pair of shoulders popped from the roof. A leg from a differently placed devil shot up aside the head. Then more heads, more shoulders, more legs, more hands, across each wall, across the roof. With no light to threaten their squishy backsides, the hideous puzzle deconstructed before my eyes.

It was all the confirmation I needed.

Credit where credit is due, there's a sort of terrible brilliance to the design. The shape protects their soft, white underbellies. It also functions as camouflage, blending them into the surroundings.

And if anyone is foolish enough to touch it, well, that's just another devil to add to their ranks.

I hopped on the bike, spun around, and headed towards Anchorage.

\- - - - -

Got one thing left to do now.

Can’t let Sakari wither away thinkin’ her only son abandoned her.

Here’s to hoping she’s still up there, and hasn’t suffered Yuka’s fate already.

Once I done that, I’m not sure what’s next.

Might finally give up smuggling for good and put what I’ve learned to use.

With enough light, I could feasibly capture a colony of devils. Keep them rigidly cabin-like. From there, maybe I could find somebody to study them. Determine what the splinters are and so forth.

Feels like a pipe dream, but dreamin’ is the only thing keeping my head on straight.

That said, I don’t have any delusions about my destination after this life.

Even if I single handedly eradicate each and every devil, grind their splinters to dust and bury it all deep within the earth,

it still won’t be enough to counterbalance the damage I’ve done.

The drugs. The booze. Yuka. Sakari.

But its a start.

Moreover, once I die, once I finally get condemned to an eternity of torment in the molten pits of hell,

I’ll be able to find Ray,

And when I do, I’ll be able to let him know,

with a shit-eating grin spread wide across my jaw,

that I died a little less of an asshole

than [he did.](https://www.reddit.com/r/unalloyedsainttrina/comments/1j88zl3/welcome_to_a_very_chaotic_horror_subredditupdated/)
