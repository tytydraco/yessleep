*“Well done, brandi-badass.”*

I rolled my eyes, and clicked the talk button on the special radio Sandra had made, gazing out the window at the overcast winter sky. “It’s not over yet; Chris is out checking on the northern border today, and he says the fighting will likely continue into winter. But we stand a better chance now, at least with all the walls. There’s talk of elections.”

The radio crackled with static, the elongated antenna a finnicky thing made from scrap by one of our researcher technicians. I’d set out first thing this morning to find a nice high vantage point, hoping to extend the little handheld radio’s signal far enough to reach Jamie. The small maintenance vestibule under the massive gearworks of the university’s clock tower made an excellent perch and gave me an unobstructed view of most of Black Oak. To my surprise, the plan seemed to work rather well, and hearing her voice again made me want to cry.

*“Make sure Dekker throws his hat in the ring.”* She replied, and I could almost see the smirk on her face as if she had been right there in the room with me. *“Knowing him, he’ll try to sneak off and go back to ranging, or something dumb like that. If Sean isn’t well enough to enter the running by then, don’t let Chris accept anything less than the presidency.”*

“I’m sure it’s crossed his mind.” I looked down at the ring on my left hand, my stomach churning in nervous butterflies. Part of me didn’t want to tell her, but how could I keep something like this from Jamie? Would it make her situation worse, knowing the man she loved was marrying her best friend? Could I even make things worse for someone who faced an entire winter by herself in the zone?

*“You still there?”* Jamie’s concerned tone cut through my anxious thoughts, and I drew in a shuddery breath.

“Still here. I have some news, actually. It’s not that big of a deal, and with everything going on it’s going to be a while yet, but . . .” My words failed me at the end, and I let the talk button go to squeeze my eyes shut. This wasn’t just stupid, it was cruel.

*“He proposed, didn’t he?”* Her words came through with a tinge of humor, as if she were the one rolling her eyes at me now.

In spite of the fact that I sat alone in the tower room, my face went hot, ears burning. “How did you know?”

It was silent on her end for a second, and something about that sent barbs of pain through my chest, thinking about Jamie sitting in some frigid tent somewhere, hungry, thirsty, and alone. A crew of workers were cooking breakfast in the school cafeteria with supplies ‘liberated’ from the Organs’ stock, and I’d spent most of the early morning dozing in Chris’s warm embrace. My hair was clean from a steamy shower I’d taken in our own private bathroom, and my clothes smelled of mint laundry detergent. How could I be so selfish, saying things like this to her? It was like holding the picture of a steak in front of a starving man.

*“I know Dekker.”* Jamie sighed, with a chuckle at the end that I’m sure she meant to sound happy but came through the speaker as a melancholy rattle. *“He’s nothing if not predictable. I’m happy for you, both of you.”*

Swallowing hard, I clicked my radio button and watched a bank of dull gray clouds drift by overhead. “I’m going to come for you. We don’t need as many people on the front right now, so I’ll get a car and some extra food and I’ll drive out to pick you up.”

*“That’s not a good idea.”* She sounded tired now, and I wondered how much she’d been able to sleep. *“People will know, they’ll accuse Dekker of going back on his word to uphold justice. It would torpedo his chances of ever being leader of anything, Hannah.”*

“But we wouldn’t have to break any rules.” The moment she let up on her talk button, I jabbed mine, refusing to let her stop me. “You’re banished in the southlands, but they never said anything about the north. Now that it’s free, I can get you an apartment in Black Oak, and you’ll be safe.”

*“You want to ruin everything, now, when you’re so close to winning?”* Her voice cracked and bore a sudden harshness that took me by surprise. *“You’re an officer, Dekker is an officer, you can’t do anything to help me. I pleaded guilty to cover your ass, so don’t you dare throw it all away trying to play the hero.”*

My shoulders slumped, and I waited in the silence that followed, unsure what was going on at her end. Was she fuming at me? Screaming at the sky? I’d stolen everything from her, I was the reason she was stuck out there. Jamie had every right to hate me till the day she died.

At last, the familiar *click* echoed over the airwaves, and Jamie came back on, her voice wavering a little, as though she had to work hard to maintain her composure. *“Sorry. I just . . . I can’t, alright? I can’t go back. There’s nothing for me in that world anymore.”*

Painful tightness gripped my lungs, and I keyed my mic in desperation. “Not even me?”

Silence again.

*“You’re the only reason I’m still breathing, Hannah.”*

My mind spiraled when I understood what she meant, and I shook my head in rapid fire. “Don’t do that, Jamie, don’t you do that. Come on, I want you here with me, I can make it work, there’s room enough for you. We’re going to need every rifle we can get to survive the winter, and you’re one of our best.”

More silence.

Refusing to give up, I keyed the mic, my voice cracking as my own emotions rose. “You’re my best friend. I want you to have Christmas dinner with me, I want to have a New Year’s sleepover where we play cards like we used to, I want you to be there to when I get married so you can tell me I won’t puke my guts out and screw the whole thing up. I *need* you, Jamie. Don’t check out on me. Please.”

A long, heartrending pause followed in the wake of my tirade.

*“I need to go. Got to get more wood before dark. Thanks for the chat and . . . and congratulations. Bye, Hannah.”*

“No, Jamie don’t go.” I panicked, held the talk button down and shouted into the speaker. “Don’t go, Jamie, please. Please just talk to me a little longer, just five more minutes. Jamie?”

But no more sound came from the other side of the radio, and my heart sank.

Dropping the handset on the desk, I buried my face in both hands.

*What am I supposed to do? How do I fix this? Can it be fixed?*

A soft touch on my shoulder startled me, and I blinked up through the beginnings of tears to see Eve’s sympathetic face.

“I brought you breakfast.” She set a bowl of steaming oatmeal on the desk and slid onto the stool opposite me to watch with concern in her golden irises. “I, um . . . I heard everything, on the way up the stairs. Are you okay?”

Part of me wanted to put up a brave front, to wipe the tears away and pretend, but the genuine way in which Eve waited for my response broke down my walls. “No.”

She winced and opened her arms to wrap me in a hug. I hated myself for this, being on such a roller-coaster of emotions as of late, but it felt good to not pretend. Officers didn’t have the luxury of crying in front of their troops, and being Head Ranger placed extra weight on my need to put up a brave front for the men. I could only ever be normal around Chris, and despite the much-needed respite of this morning, I still felt emotionally broken. Jamie’s predicament made it worse, a knife in my heart that twisted harder the more I thought about it.

*If that were me out there, I would have put a bullet in my head by now. Oh Jamie. This is all my fault.*

Eve cried with me, her tears wet on the fabric of my shirt, and when at last we reached an end to the sorrow, she leaned back to look me in the eye. “Do you hate me?”

Wiping at my face with the sleeve of my sweater, I blinked at her, shocked. “No. Why would I hate you?”

She frowned and looked down at her hands, picking at the perfect nails with timid remorse. “I was the one who passed sentence along with Adam. It was our duty, to God and man, but we both carry that burden on our shoulders, and I’ll admit, it is a heavy one to bear. Adam offers up prayer for Jamie every day, as do I.”

Pity rippled through me at her sadness, and it occurred to me that Eve had been thrust into this mess the same as I had. She’d been happy in Ark River, with her animals, her ever-growing church family, and Adam’s worshipful affection. I had little doubt she only wanted to spend the winter in their cozy parsonage, nurture the baby that grew inside her swelling belly, and love her husband as the snows fell outside their window. This war had spoiled it, forced her into cold battle armor more often than a comfy dress, and dragged her miles away from the beautiful sanctuary she called home, into the smoking squalor of a burned-out city. Yet, through all that, she too thought of Jamie.

I reached out to squeeze her hand and did my best to smile. “No, I don’t hate you. I don’t hate Adam either. As you said, sometimes we don’t get a choice in our responsibilities. It’s just . . . there’s so much happening so fast, and I’m worried about Jamie.”

Eve nodded, and studied the radio on the desk between us, as if she hoped to divine some kind of answers from it. “I worry too. Perhaps you can speak with Chris, and arrange a sortie to go find her? I’d be willing to help with the tracking party.”

For a moment, my heart rose, but then I remembered my conversation with Lucille in Ark River and sighed in disappointment. “An officer of the coalition cannot interfere with the sentencing. Even if I could go find her, if word got out, it would sink Chris’s chances of being elected once this war ends. Jamie’s right; I couldn’t do that, not to him, or to all the people out there that need him.”

Her own expression crumpled a little, but Eve didn’t seem surprised by my response. “You’ll find that a wife’s duty is not as easy as the world makes it out to be. Our husbands are gifts to us from God, and we to them, but with that gift comes the charge of caring for someone above yourself. With the right man, this isn’t too burdensome, but sadly, it seems many don’t find such men.”

“Chris is good to me.” I sheepishly held up my hand so she could see the ring, it’s silver-encrusted diamond gleaming in the pale aura of the ceiling light. “I want to be as good to him, but it’s hard sometimes. I feel like I’m torn between being his soldier and his woman, with never enough time to do both.”

Eve smiled and tapped her own neck as she nodded her honey-blonde head at mine. “Judging by his mark on you, I think you’re doing just fine.”

I cocked my head to one side, confused, and glanced at my reflection in the nearby window.

*What the . . .*

A faint bruise lay on the base of my neck, and tugging aside my shirt collar, I found a few more across my collarbone and shoulders, all in the places Chris considered ‘within the proper boundaries’. He had been nothing but tender with me in the luxurious hours we’d spent together this morning, and for that reason it had never occurred to me to look for such things. After all, I was used to getting a bruise or two from the rough-and-tumble life of a Ranger, but those were marks earned in pain, not pleasure. This was different; each darkened portion of skin reminded me of how Chris moved, light and agile, keenly aware of my every desire. Remembering the taste of his kiss, the smell of his hair, the feeling of his lips on my skin only made the ravenous ache in my core flare brighter, and it fascinated me that I could need him so badly.

*Um, hello, earth to Hannah? You’ve got hiccys on your neck, moron. If Eve can see them so can everyone else.*

At that thought, another wave of humiliated lava seemed to flow under the skin of my face, and I did my best to bunch my shirt collar up around the bruises. “We didn’t do anything, I swear. Just . . . I mean we didn’t, you know . . . Chris wants to wait, I want that too, and . . .”

Eve giggled and held up a hand to stifle my panic. “I’m not here to interrogate you, Hannah. I remember what it was like before Adam and I were married. He wanted to wait until the first round of our new family was settled in before we had the ceremony. We managed to hold ourselves in check, but for a while it seemed the ring couldn’t come soon enough, and I had more than a few marks of my own.”

“Really?” Relieved at her empathy, I half chuckled, unable to grasp such devout people being so ‘frisky’ as Jamie would have said.

My curious surprise must have been obvious, and Eve made a rare, mischievous grin, her golden eyes twinkling as she patted the slight rounding to her stomach. “You think this baby got there by itself?”

*Yeah, I guess that was a dumb question.*

“Sorry.” I wrapped both arms around myself, the lightweight sweater what I usually wore under my uniform jacket still a little thin in the chilly clocktower room. “I just . . . I’m not used to this sort of thing. He’s the first for me, ever.”

She let slide a wistful smile as Eve ran another smoothing hand over her stomach, and shrugged in a simplistic ease that made her seem older than she really was. “God made man and woman for each other, it’s only natural you feel enthusiastic about it. I know you are still uncertain about your own beliefs, so I won’t tell you what to do, but I will say that I was far more comfortable on our first night together as Adam’s *wife* than I would have been as anything else. There’s a peace that comes in sharing yourself with someone who has sworn to love you for the rest of your life, and it makes the learning process easier.”

I imagined Chris and I, in a cozy cabin all our own back in Ark River, with a blazing fire and nothing between us but excited heartbeats. Holding back had been a challenge this morning, and there had been more than a few times I contemplated seeing if I could push Chris into bending some of his rules in the heat of the moment. Being with him was like being on some magical drug that I couldn’t get enough of, a fire that drove me crazy every time I got close. It was somewhat scary to think about, but considering how intoxicating this morning had been, I couldn’t say I didn’t want to try.

*That is, assuming the first time isn’t excruciating.*

“Is it bad?” Scooting closer to Eve, I dared to voice my naïve doubts, feeling like an idiot for not knowing how this most basic act of our species worked. “The, uh, learning process?”

She shook her head, a more understanding look replacing the mischievous one across her freckled countenance. “A good man is a gentle one, and Chris doesn’t strike me as rough. Part of the beauty is learning about each other as you go and growing together as one. It’ll take time, and a fair bit of ‘practice’, but you’ll figure it out.”

Both embarrassed to be having this conversation with someone other than my mother, and yet somewhat calmed at Eve’s words, I eyed the ring on my hand. “Do you think the war will end soon?”

Eve’s perfect features morphed into a grim stoicism that her kind were rather partial to, as if looking far beyond this moment into some unseen window of time. “I don’t know. Mankind has been killing each other since Cain struck down his brother Abel in the beginning. Once we learn sinful habits, humans have a difficult time giving them up.”

Feet thundered on the steps with unceremonious speed, and Lucille appeared, her uniform clean, crimson hair tied into a practical soldier’s bun. “Captain? Commander Dekker needs you in the headmaster’s office right away. He asked for you too, Madam Stirling.”

Eve and I exchanged a tense glance. A meeting of the coalition heads could only mean something had come up that had to be addressed by all of us, and that almost guaranteed trouble. It seemed our momentary peace had already been shattered, and I missed the shy optimism I’d fumbled with only a few minutes ago when daydreaming of Chris.

*It just never stops. One crisis after another. Imagine how busy it will get if Chris does get elected to the presidency?*

“We’ll be there.” Standing, I accepted Eve’s offer of her arm, and we walked down the winding steps to the main building in tandem silence.

All along the way, I stared into the ground at my feet, mind lost in contemplation. Despite our vast differences in origin, Eve and I were more alike now than when I’d first entered Barron County. Thanks to my mutations we were, in a roundabout way, distant kin, and our children would share in the mysterious genetic line of golden-eyed people who seemed tailor-made for this strange new world. She deeply believed in Adonai, and I myself had warmed to the idea of God quite a lot in the past few months, given everything I’d seen. More practically, we both wanted only safety for our loved ones, but were uncertain as to what that looked like. Eve bore the weight of leading their congregation alongside her husband, while I found myself taking on more and more of the governmental role with Chris, something I hadn’t bargained for at the start.

We were being dragged into an ever-increasing whirlpool of power, and while I would never abandon Chris to go it alone, part of me wondered if, in the end, it wouldn’t drown us all.
