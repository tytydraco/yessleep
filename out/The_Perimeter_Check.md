The prison system… Not quite the place I ever imagined myself working. Some of the prisons within the state are over 30-years old, and those are the younger prisons. Several of the old ones are over 100 years old. These places have seen their fair share of violence, and bloodshed. Men come in and become predators, even more become prey. It’s places like these were one can witness what a man can truly do to another man. Many leave reformed, and many leave learning how to be a better criminal. No air conditioning in the summer within the cell blocks, combined with the attitudes of men who believed themselves to each be the top dog on the yard. It spells the perfect recipe for violence.
 
Many people have come into the system, and never made it out. Either because of their sentence, another inmate, or their own hand. It’s those situations where you realize that even though they are gone, something may have stayed behind. Sometimes that something is malevolent and makes itself known. There are also other things out there that sometimes make their presence known. Many prisons are built in rural areas where there may be nothing for miles. Sometimes deadly things lurk outside of those walls. Things hiding in the woods, or deserts that make up the surroundings that would make even the worse inmate look tame. That’s where I want to start with my experiences in these places. These places of concrete and iron harbor some of the most dangerous criminals known to man, but the places outside of the walls harbor things much, much worse.
 
For the sake of safety, I will not mention my name, or what facility I work at. This is my story of an encounter with something that still haunts my mind, and always keeps me in an extra state of alertness on those foggy nights outside.
 
One of the most important things that needs to be done daily is a perimeter inspection. It can be a nice break from the stress that goes on inside of the facility. Most prisons have two perimeter fences. One on the inside and the other on the outside. Inspections are done on each shift to ensure the padlocks are secured and the fence has not been tampered or compromised in any way. I was new to the shift. My first few weeks inside after training and I found myself ready to properly conduct the inner perimeter check. It was 2100 hours, and the sun had already set, leaving a bright full moon and stars visible throughout the night sky. The inner perimeter consisted of me walking along behind the buildings with a flashlight and keys to open the locks. A thick but patchy fog had rolled in from the west out of the woods that surrounded the facility. Before I knew it, I was in deep, and my flashlight, can of pepper spray, and radio were my only saving grace in case of anything.
 
I was inspecting behind one of the buildings and checking the emergency doors leading to the perimeter when I initially heard what I thought was thunder. I glanced up but the sky was spotless aside from the stars. It was then that I noticed the sounds were coming from my left. Across from the prison was a horse pasture where the prison horses resided. They were utilized in the event of escapes to search the trails and dirt roads that ran through the woods. The sound I heard was the horses running from one end of the pasture all the way across to the other where they proceeded to huddle together and began neighing with fear. Being at a far distance I was unable to determine what had spooked them. I shined my light over to where they had run from, but the light was unable to reach the fence line to the pasture. I utilized my radio and notified the mobile patrol officer who drove circles around the prison all day watching for anything suspicious.
 
I requested that he come to my position and use his spotlight to inspect the pasture as something had frightened the horses. As I waited, I kept an eye on the horses. From what I was able to make out it appeared that they were looking towards the farthest end of the pasture. There was no light, and I didn’t hear anything, but something there had frightened them and made them run. Just then the mobile patrol officer had pulled up on the perimeter road with his window down. He asked how I was, and I told him I was alright, then explained again what I wanted him to do. He complied and opened his door, half exiting the vehicle he held out the spotlight and turned it on. Shining it over the roof of the car he began scanning the horse pasture starting where the horses were. As he reached the far end, he noticed something laying in the far corner of the pasture where the grass was tall. He said he would go and see what it was as he couldn’t make it out from our position.
 
He instructed me to continue with my perimeter inspection, and being the senior officer that he was I complied. Several minutes had gone by and I began to feel an uneasiness creeping up my spine as I continued to think about what may have scared the horses. It was at that moment that the mobile patrol officer had come over the radio and requested the officer in the guard tower closest to the horse pasture shine his own spotlight over the pasture and scan the area. As I watched the guard tower a larger spotlight had been turned on and was scanning over the pasture. The shift lieutenant inside of the prison heard the radio traffic and asked if any assistance was needed. The mobile patrol officer requested that they meet at the front of the facility.
 
At the time I thought it could have been a drop. Sometimes inmates will manage to have someone place packages of drugs or cell phones outside of the prison where a trustee may be able to retrieve it and find a way to sneak it into the facility. Maybe whoever did it spooked the horses which caused them to run? I thought that… and I made myself believe that because it made sense. However, the reality of it was far from the case.
 
As I continued walking, I was heading directly towards the tower. The officer was still shining the spotlight over the pasture when something hit the fence behind me. I immediately looked to my left and saw the fence moving heavily as if someone was climbing it. I looked farther down the fence line behind me where it disappeared into the fog and the shaking stopped. As the shaking stopped, I heard something heavy hit the ground, and I saw a large shadow rising in the fog that immediately darted to the left and was gone. I began walking backwards not taking my eyes from where the shadow had been. I used my radio and called for the guard tower to redirect his spotlight to my location and scan the area. As the officer did this, the lieutenant came over the radio asking me what was going on. I told him that someone had climbed the fence into the perimeter of the facility. He immediately asked if I was sure someone had come into the perimeter, and I assured him that I was.
 
He instructed me to inspect the area and he was sending additional staff to assist me. The guard tower began shining their light in the area I was in while I searched the darker areas with my flashlight. I held my can of pepper spray in my trembling hand as I continued my inspection. As I reached the area of the fence where I suspected the intruder had entered, I noticed the razor wire on the top of the fence had been pulled down. There appeared to be blood on the tips of the razor wire that hung down and tufts of hair dangling from it as well. This told me the intruder had been injured as he scaled the fence.
 
I reached an area I had inspected earlier located behind one of the buildings and began to inspect it again when I heard what sounded like deep breathing coming from a darkened area of the inner perimeter. I was barely able to make out a large dark lump on the ground. Before I could turn my flashlight towards it, the lump began to rise. It was then that I realized what I was looking at had been crouched low to the ground. Fear struck me like a freight train, and I was unable to move. I froze in place, unable to speak, unable to scream, and barely able to breathe. The thing rose up on two powerful legs and began a deep guttural growl. It towered above me at what I assumed to be about 7 ½ to 8 feet. Its long, clawed arms hung low below its bended knees and it hunched forward. Its fur covered the upper area of it’s back and most of the body. Its pointed ears which stood on end had gone flat against its head. Though I couldn’t see its face, I could see its eyes reflecting the moonlight.
 
I didn’t raise my flashlight, either because I couldn’t or because I wouldn’t. I didn’t want to see its face, I didn’t want to see its teeth, I didn’t want to see IT!
 
It swiped at me with a clawed hand that was almost human except for its size. The color of the skin was dark. I suddenly found myself on my back trying desperately to back away from it. As it began bearing down on me, I heard the report of two gunshots. The thing turned its head to the right revealing a long snout full of deadly teeth. Another gunshot made it jump over me onto the fence where it climbed over with ease and disappeared into the night. Looking to my left I could see the officer in the guard tower aiming his AR-15 into the area of the horse pasture. The additional staff showed up and the fear that had consumed me eased up immensely.
 
The thing was gone.
I passed out as the adrenaline wore off, and exhaustion took over. When I came to, there were paramedics tending to the claw marks across my chest. When asked what happened I could only state that I was attacked by a large animal. I dare not say what I believed it to be out of fear that I’d be laughed at, mocked, or even thought of as crazy. I kept that to myself for a time.
 
I learned later that what the mobile patrol officer discovered was a dead horse. Its throat had been ripped open and was covered in large bite marks. The officer in the guard tower gave the description of a black bear that had attacked me. I went along with it to avoid being thought of as crazy. The scars it left across my chest were questionable due to the positioning of the claws. They appeared more like a human hand than bear claws. The incident was closed as such, but I know that what I saw was no bear.
 
I thanked the officer who saved me that night. We spoke for a while. He was 30 years in and on the verge of retirement. I’ll tell some of his stories here when the time is right. He told me something after my encounter that I remember to this day. He said to me: “We always stay inside the facility at night when we can. Some of the old hands know this, but most of the people inside are like you… new. Nobody thinks it can happen until it does, but now you know. Don’t go out there in the night… especially when the wolfsbane is in bloom and the autumn moon is full and bright”.
