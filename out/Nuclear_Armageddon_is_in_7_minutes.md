Total nuclear annihilation is at 6 o’clock tonight: it is 5:53pm and I wait on the porch for certain death. Gently rolling the heels of my boots against the plank floor, I rocked gently in my chair: a lukewarm cup of coffee lay on the table by the untouched daily paper, and gently resting under the window behind was my browning double-barrelled shotgun.

You never thought the end of the world would be spread by word of mouth, but in rural Spokane, it started with the mailman; then the neighbour; then the delivery boy on his bike. Whispers arose this morning about a plane due to ride across town, and later, that it was a military aircraft. Heads no doubt turned, a lot stayed still. 

That was my second surprise when sitting on the precipice of absolute doom: it’s quiet. Peacock Meadows, our little hamlet on the outskirts of town, barely moved. Silhouettes occasionally passed windows but I was the only person outside, and I had been since the mailman came forty minutes ago to give me the last copy of *The Spokesman.* 

He was the one who told me. 

“Presidents day,” he said, “...best day to do it.”

I stood with my fresh mug of coffee on the stoop, I had just taken the rolled newspaper from his hand and, as I remember, we’d only been talking for a few minutes, mostly on trivial bullshit. But that final part caught me.

“Gonna be a big one, no holding back. Right at the town square. Everyone’ll see it for miles,” He didn’t meet my eyes when he said it. He seemed… not solemn, exactly. Just careful. Like he’d already had this conversation twice today and didn’t want a third person telling him he was exaggerating. “The sky will be *filled* with smoke, but I guess that doesn’t matter, it’ll clear eventually, always does.”

I was taken aback. 

“Uh,” I turned to place my coffee and the paper on the small table by the rocking chair, “Should I…be leaving now?”

He offered an innocent chuckle but muted it with his hand, and by the time he withdrew it from his mouth, all smiles had disappeared completely, “I mean, you’d be cutting it close,” he said, “but if it’s any consolation - staying here wouldn’t make much a difference to going anyway. Something that big? You ain’t missing it. Wouldn’t matter.”

He hissed air through his teeth and clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth. 

“Sooner I finish here, less of a chance I don’t get home. It’ll be gridlock downtown, ” He replied, fishing in his bulking rucksack for a fresh paper, turning in the direction of the neighbours, “better I spread the word though! Anyway, enjoy the show.”

He chuckled once more, dry and forced, and trailed off across the sidewalk. 

My grandfather, Jonathan Becks, was a fighter pilot in World War II. All throughout my life, from when I understood spoken English until his death in 2009, he told me tales about the war. Young me got the funny stories: jokes, routines, the little moments of being a kid in a man’s uniform.

Years later, when he got sicker and I got older, he opened up about the darkest parts of deployment. Things he’d sat alone with for decades. Confessions. The worst one -the most terrifying and visceral - was Nagasaki.

Not long after the blast, he flew over the city as part of the post-strike assessment. There were cameras on board for documenting the impact site. He told me he flew low. Low enough to see it wasn’t a city anymore, just a smudge against the landscape, an abscess of smoke and char. At that altitude he was spared no recourse from the devastation caused by his country: although he couldn’t see faces nor specifics, he could see clusters of the dead near the riverbanks, and the living walking without purpose or direction. He told me, “Pray you die in the blast, ‘cus afterwards, it’s nothin’ but agony, for everyone.”

I was in my early twenties when he told me the story, it must’ve been three weeks before he’d pass, and he spared no details. Not only from his experience but what his buddies told him, too: on-the-ground perspectives from citizens who’d been interviewed and tales of the ‘alligator people’ who were so badly maimed they could do nothing but crawl. 

The bomb had tormented my grandfather’s life.

The bomb quickly became a torment to me, too.

Teachers said I had a ‘good capacity to create my own worlds’ when I was younger - a pretty fucking convoluted way of saying I daydreamed too much. Unfortunately, on the day my grandfather confessed, that bad habit became a cancer that metastasised over my mind. Non-stop film reels of the attack. 

Thinking of the size of the blast;

The brightness of the blast;

The temperature of the blast. 

I would lay in bed next to my wife and imagine the rumble, the falling of glass in glittering shards, the scorch. Maybe it would be painless, sure, but that’s no guarantee. But I guess the mailman was right: in the end, it *“wouldn’t matter.”*

Nuclear armageddon is in 5 minutes.

My hands are still vibrating. 

I stare out over the humble skyline of Spokane. We were never a prominent name in urbanism; our tallest buildings would resemble cargo containers to the big cities, like New York. A bomb would crumple it like a sandcastle. 

The Bank of America Finance Center, our tallest and proudest monument to commerce, would surely pop like a zit from the initial shockwave. Glass would be shredded from the windows and rebar would erupt from the walls.

The Davenport Hotel would be a tin-can containing hundreds of people, kicked quite literally against the curb. But if the mailman was right, and it was due to the center-masse of our little city, my wife and I wouldn’t have been the ‘lucky ones’: radiation would come in droves and would kill us from the inside, turning intestine and kidney alike into pink pulp.

I couldn’t let that happen. Not to the woman I love. 

This rocking chair I sat on, gently careening backwards and forwards, was supposed to be where I sat with a son or daughter on my knee, answering their questions about how the world worked. My wife and I - we’d only recently looked at renovating the spare room into a nursery. Not pregnant yet but…preparation couldn’t hurt, right?

I snorted, bitterly. The most I did in that room was put up a shelf. 

Before I left the front door to sit out here, I’d snagged a pack of Marlboro Reds from the desk drawer in my office, where I’d kept them for emergencies. When I put them there though, I’d imagined ‘emergencies’ to consist of an argument with my wife or maybe an unpaid bill coming to bite me in the ass. A nuclear holocaust wasn’t exactly on the bingo cards. I guess I’ll be having two.

Flicking the box, every cigarette sat filter-up but one: my grandfather smoked like a chimney, it was what killed him, and he always flipped one cigarette to face the other way. Apparently, he’d picked it up from a marine he met. Well, I got into the practice of it too, a way to honour the old man.

I struggled to light it. Every finger had pin-and-needles, my index twitched and it made me drop the zippo flat onto my lap. The eventual huff of acrid smoke was like heaven, only for its cindering tip to remind me of what’s about to happen. I almost put it out. Almost.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 4 minutes.

There are a few sirens in the distance. Civil unrest must be rising in the city center, people clawing to get as far away as possible. I guess they didn’t understand how nukes work, but yet again, I’d done way more research into them than your average person.

They were trying to squander the only merit to their situation: proximity. They would be nothing but shadows on the pavement at such close range, many have died worse deaths than that. Instantaneous. That’s the way.

Taking another long pull of the cigarette, I flickered my eyes towards my shotgun  that I had stood against the windowpane, still entrenched in thought. I guess that was an instant way out, too: hell, I’d even taken the care of putting a second shell in the barrel.

Thinking over a nuclear blast event, so vividly and often, I found that I’d started to dramatise it all in my head. Everything got bigger on every little simulation in my mind. So, as it lay only minutes away, I found myself becoming more and more of a hypocrite. I was… morbidly fascinated with it and suicide felt like heresy. All of this fear, constantly revolving around hypotheticals, had eaten at me so much that when I was finally met with the opportunity to see it for myself, it felt as if I could finally put a face to a name. There’s no easy way of describing it: I just *needed* to experience it. 

My wife didn’t. She didn’t have the curiosity that I did. She didn’t experience the fear that I always had. 

I continue smoking. 

Nuclear Armageddon is in 3 minutes.

Finishing my cigarette, I put it out on my copy of *The Spokesman.* Half-folded, I could only make out the tips of today’s big title, and that’s all I really needed to see. News of the attack would have only become common knowledge an hour ago, and the mailman would have already been hurling these into laws and postboxes: nothing on that page would be of any value to me anymore. Keeping up with college football or the recent mayoral election felt so insignificant now.

The sirens were getting more plentiful - I figured that people were really starting to lose their shit now. The doors to public buildings were probably being shut in the faces of panicking crowds, aching to find shelter from the empty street, and the police were probably being swept up in the trampling masses as opposed to policing them. Poor bastards. Nobody asked for this.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 2 minutes.

As I stare out over Spokane, a cruiser begins to drive towards the street. Its lights flash and sirens carve up the silence that had reigned over Peacock Meadows since I'd come back out on the porch.

I continue to rock and reach into my pocket for that second cigarette.

Two officers emerge from the cruiser and, upon glancing the shotgun by my window, immediately seem apprehensive.

“Is al-o-st t-ighm!” I shout with the cig in my teeth, which melted my speech into a slew of vowels. Upon lighting it, I took it from my mouth, “Go home to your families.”

The two of them resemble a comedic duo: short and pudgy, taller and thin. From the passenger side, the shorter one wouldn’t dare step toward the curb, but the taller one walked closer with a hand resting near his belt. “We’re more worried about yours,” he said.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 1 minute.

I snort, sigh, and motion towards the firearm that they’re oh-so-scared of. 

“You don’t gotta worry about that,” I shout back at them, almost playful-like, as I once more continue to choke that smoke deeper into my lungs, “Look: you may not see it right now, but in sixty seconds, you’ll understand *why*.”

And if right on cue: a blip begins to swim across the skies from somewhere to the west. It looks like a gnat, a flea: ironic, the thing that kills me looks like it could be found crawling through the hairs of a housecat. The police keep calling out but my eyes stay glued firmly on the plane. It is so graceful. It twists and turns, elaborately threading the air until I notice the plumes of colour jetting out from behind it. 

At first, it looks like the regular steam.

But as I continue to focus, I can’t help but notice that it's red. The plane is spewing red shit. The plane coming to kill us all has red smoke coming from its tailend.

I have never been a Biblical man. Nobody in my family ever has. My grandfather gave up believing in the war and, thus, he didn’t give my mother much incentive to become a churchgoer. All this being said, I can’t help but see the correlation between the red smoke of the bomber and the lava soaked plains of Hell.

I guess it’s much too late to ask for a pardon from God. Not after what I did. I’d be down there, with the sinners and the wretches. I’ll be getting what I deserved. But, at least to me, I’ll know what I did was a kindness to somebody I loved.

Nuclear Armageddon is in 30 seconds.

The police. The street. The newspaper. The skyline. The plane. I shut it all out as I squeeze my eyes shut. The cigarette was no longer in my hands, I must’ve dropped it. I can still taste it. It coats my throat.

The light hitting my eyelids casts strange shapes and colours across my vision. It’s all mostly orange and red, big plumes and blotches. Soon it may turn white.

I’m counting down in my head the entire time now.

*19, 18, 17…*

Honestly, I think I’d live everything the same, if I get reincarnated. Down to every last detail. I’ve always lived as an honest, caring, kind person. I’ve always tried to do what's right for people, even if *they* didn’t know it.

*…14, 13, 12…*

I just realised, this entire time, I didn’t even tell you my wife’s name. It is, or it *was*, Josie. The only girl I ever loved, somebody beautiful, somebody empathetic. When you love as hard as I did, you’d wish your loved one would never have to endure any pain or hardship ever again. The very thought of it breaks you. You want them to be numb to all the bad in the world.

*…9, 8, 7…*

That’s why I did it.

Please, please understand. 

When we were younger, we had this dog who got a bad infection on its belly. Caught itself on a fence. My grandfather told me, after letting me say my goodbyes, that it's “better to help it not hurt than do nothing.” 

I was just trying to spare her from the blast. She didn’t know what I knew.

*…3, 2, 1…*

Suddenly, I was ejected from the rocking chair and flung into the small wooden table at my left. Coffee splashed against my back and, a second later, ceramic crunches as it hits the floor. My wrists are pinned against my back.

“-to control, we were responding to the 10-103, suspect has been apprehended-”

After a few seconds, I slowly peel my eyelids back up. The fat officer was the one to grab me, pinning me to the floor with a knee that dug into my spine. His partner, the tall one, took the shotgun and tossed it out into the yard across the grass. A few seconds later, that same officer opens the door to our home and walks inside.

From the radio that the little officer has on his shoulder, I hear the words of his partner, all tinny and crackly. His voice is shaking.

“-uh, reporting one female, they are D.O.A., I repeat - one deceased female, looks like- fuck, it looks like an gunshot wound to the back of her head-"

And his words bleed out as I crane my neck and turn to look away. White fragments of my mug litter around a central puddle of coffee that had stained the woodboards. This smear manages to catch the corners of that copy of *The Spokesman*, now flat across the ground with its title in booming letters. At the angle of reading it, seeing as my cheek was pressed to the floor, it took me a little longer to make out the words.

But I do:

‘PRESIDENTS DAY AIR SHOW: 6PM, RIVER PARK SQUARE.’

With my gut now in free-fall, my eyes darted around, desperate to catch something that proves I was right. That makes this all mean something. That it, the *bomb*, was happening. I only manage to catch glimpses of that plane careening over the skyline. 

There’s more of them now.

4 different aircraft in total.

They spin in formation and do loop-da-loops in perfect synchronisation.

They all have different colours of smoke. Red. Blue. Green. Yellow.

They use these trails to create patterns in the sky. Behind, I hear a huff of resignation.

“Alright,” the officer behind me says, “Up you come.”

He hoists me up by the arm.

An ambulance is here now, a stretcher clatters up the stoop where I’d stood this morning, coffee in hand, talking to the mailman.

*An Air Show*, I thought to myself - nausea rising, words turning to static.

*He was talking about an Air Show.*
