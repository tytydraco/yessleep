I still remember my first execution like it was yesterday. A 50-something year old man who shot his 2 kids and wife for whatever reason. The judge decided the world was better off without him and sent him to the gas chamber. I was 25 when I watched him die.I remember going to confession the next day, begging God on my hands and knees for forgiveness.  It's been about 30 years since then. 

I work on D block at Harrison State Prison, near El Paso in Texas. It's a  very old prison, built before the first world war. It hardly gets any funding either, the meals suck, the uniforms still have stripes on them, and only in the last 5 years the death row upgrade to lethal injection. I'm willing to bet that you could hammer the wall with a spoon and it would fall apart, yet somehow we haven't had an escape in over forty years.

Daryl Hoss came to us in 2013. He was a strange man, about six and a half feet tall, skinny, and pale. His eyes seemed to be perpetually bloodshot and he was always sweating. But despite how offputting he was, we still gave him the standard procedure. We searched every cavity of his body, shaved him clean, threw him in the shower, and put him in his cell. The numbers stitched into his uniform was 7289-31.

Judge Jacob Hower had sentenced him to die on the lethal injection gurney on August 15th. He had killed four hikers with a shotgun and stolen their money and clothes before tossing their bodies in a river. State patrol had picked him up near Fort Hancock trying to cross the border. After finding the money, clothes, and about seven pounds of cocaine in the trunk they packed him up and shipped him off to the Hudspeth county courthouse for sentencing. 

He had a large tattoo across his back that read ¨Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed¨. A bible verse, Genesis nine verse six. The tattoo looked off on his skin, almost like it didn't fit right, or did not belong. Nonetheless we paid it no mind.

Daryl never slept. Not once. He always stood at the bars of his cell, just looking out into the corridor. Whenever we would make the rounds he would just stare at us. One night, me and Carl Hiltmore, one of three other yards besides myself, were on shift. He just kept standing there, staring at Carl. And I mean he seemingly could not take his eyes off of him, and we noticed.

He went up to the bars of the cell and banged his nightstick on the metal, but the man didn't even flinch. Carl was only five feet and six inches tall, so this guy towered over him. His pale skin was made even whiter by the fluorescent lights and it casted shadows on his face. His mouth hung open and he drooled. 

¨You best keep to yer darn self,¨ he said sternly, ¨I catch you lookin´ again I´m puttin´ you in the hole.¨ The man again said nothing, and he didn't even move. Carl backed up slightly. 

¨Alright, lights out.¨ he said in a quieter tone of voice. The lights went out and the corridor was nearly pitch black. At the end of the hall was a room that Me and Carl would spend the night in. There was a television, a microwave, a coffee maker, etcetera. Before I walked in I looked back. The man's eyes looked back at me, glowing red in the light like a cat's eyes, or like in the flash of an old picture from the eighties. His body was hidden in the darkness, and It just creeped me out. Quickly I shut the door and went in.

August 15th rolled around without any other incident, other than the creepy nature of the fella and the constant staring. Eight o'clock sharp tonight. We spent the entire day getting ready, making sure the straps on the lethal injection gurney were good and in place, making sure the cardiogram worked, that the IV tubes were properly hooked up, all that stuff. 

He spoke with the prison chaplain for about an hour, got no last meal (Texas doesn't do that anymore) and finally we led him into the chamber. He seemed to get taller when we let him out in handcuffs; his skin had gotten paler somehow. The prison shirt hung on his thin frame and his wrists were small enough that the handcuffs had to be tightened all the way, and even then they were still a little loose. His veins bulged through his skin which was strangely leathery and cold. His eyes were still bloodshot and his face was guant and long. 

¨How in the hell is this guy alive,¨ I heard Carl mutter under his breath. I ignored the comment and when 7:40 rolled around we led him to the chamber, the warden and the prison chaplain tailing not too far behind.

We strapped him down to the gurney with surprising ease, though his hands, wrists, ankles and feet hung off the gurney. His chest hardly rose and fell and we wondered if he was breathing. He was, the warden had concluded that after putting his hand right belieth his nose and feeling the air coming in and out. The cardiogram machine picked up a heartbeat, and since his veins were so prominent we had no issue hooking up the IV tubes. 

7:50 rolled around, and the curtains were opened into the viewing room. About a dozen people were in there; a few people from the press, the district attorney and a couple other lawyers, a few county officials, and the families of the people that this man had killed. 

7:55 came. ¨Daryl Hoss,¨ Carl started. ¨Your condemnation of death by the state of Texas is about to be served. If there anything you would like to say before this sentence is executed?¨

His eyes shot open, red, dry, and bloodshot and his head tilted back and looked directly at Daryl. A creepy grin spread across his leathery face. This startled him and he swallowed hard in an attempt to hide his extreme discomfort. 

¨Alright then,¨ he continued. ¨May your passing be quick, may the families be brought closure, and may God have mercy on your soul.¨

8:00 on the dot. Carl pushed the button to inject the first chemical, which knocked him out. The second one causes full muscle paralysis, and finally the last chemical stops the heart. Carl pushed that button, the liquid was pumped in his veins, and the cardiogram flatlines. The curtains were drawn, the chaplain said a prayer, and the body was wheeled out, and we thought that was just that: the end of the road.

We didn't find out that he was alive until the next day. The first time in any of our careers, warden included. He spent a little while, probably about a week in the ICU before they put him right back in his cell. Somehow he looked even more dead than he did before, but he went right back to standing at the bars with his mouth open, drooling.

That night it was just me and Carl on night duty. The lights were off and we were hanging out in the room, playing cards and drinking some sodas. Every once in a while I glanced out and saw his glowing beady eyes looking right at us. I tried not to look, but knowing that he was staring at me through the little plexiglass window made me deeply uncomfortable. 

¨What´s on yer mind?¨ Carl finally asked. I looked up at him and shook my head. ¨Nothin’, nothin’.¨”He squinted at me but shrugged and laid his winning hand on the table, grinned, and took the twenty or so crumpled up dollars from the middle of the table and stuffed them in his pocket. 

¨Alright I'm about to wet myself, ‘scuse me.¨ he said as he stood up and walked out into the pitch black hallway. I chuckled and shook my head and took a sup from my bottle. The television played some news reports about another shooting. I had a feeling that we would hear about this guy from the judge in the not too distant future.

Fifteen minutes passed. Then twenty. Then thirty. Carl was nowhere to be seen. I opened the door and peered out into the hallway.

¨Hey Carl? You good out there?¨ I called. 

The only response I got was the gaze of Daryl's eyes. I shuddered and closed the door, embarrassed at my fear. Prison guards don't carry guns, only the guys in the guard towers did. We also usually didn't have nightsticks, the guys in the general population didn´t. But since death row is typically pretty quiet I guess  they thought we could have them. So I had that, plus a small can of pepper spray.  

Deciding to rip the metaphorical band-aid off, I opened the door and charged into the block, right past the eyes and to the bathroom down the corridor and to the left. The lights were out, so I used my flashlight to illuminate it. 

¨Carl?¨ I whispered.

I backed out of the bathroom, the silence replaced by the raspy breathing of Daryl in the cell. I glanced back, the eyes had disappeared. Maybe he had finally gone to bed, I thought. 

I used my flashlight and scanned around for Carl. I called over on my radio that I didn't know where he was, and a response cackled through about how nobody else had seen him. 

The door to the janitorial closet stood in front of me now. I grabbed the round door handle and it came away wet and red. I looked on the floor and a small amount of blood was smeared on the floor.

I ripped open the door and was met with Carl´s body looking right back at me. 

He looked like he had been there a hundred years. His body was dry, shriveled and, and stiff. He looked like a mummy, but his uniform still looked fine. He clutched his nightstick in his bony fingers, his head was thrown back and his eyes were deeply sunken in and his jaw hung wide open, his teeth brown and falling out. His bones were exposed over his tight and mummified skin. 

I stifled a scream and backed up, losing my footing and falling backward. My flashlight fell to the floor and rolled over to illuminate Daryl looking right at me. His eyes glowed in the light and he smiled a toothless grin. He was sticking his long, guant head out of the prison bars. I looked at him, then back at the corpse, then back at him.

They looked strangely...similar.
