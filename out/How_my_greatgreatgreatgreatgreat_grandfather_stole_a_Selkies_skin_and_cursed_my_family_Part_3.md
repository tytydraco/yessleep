In the end, not even the once-in-a-century storm proved to be a match for my mother. 

As the storm rolled in last night, during the wee hours of my hometown hen party, with my girlfriends and I safely indoors and clustered around bottles of vodka, its arrival was marked by trumpeting lighting bolts and ear-splitting cracks of thunder. It was just as bad as the meteorologists had been saying. Maybe even worse. The storm hit Malin’s Head like a tsunami, flooding in and washing away low-lying fences, barns, and chipping away at steadfast brick family homes. 

The entire village was on lockdown. Everyone had been ordered to stay inside. Doors and windows were boarded up. 

Except, of course, for my mother. And me. And Donal. And the unlucky priest my mother had ordered into marrying us. 

“We *need* this.” She’d said the other night, with a low tremor in her voice, after I’d been caught staring at the restless waves again. “The wedding. For the family.” *For the family*. It took everything in me not to scoff. 

But I couldn’t blame her. Out of the eight generations of O’Sullivans, I’m the last one.

My mother had carried the weight of the family curse for years, her entire life *really*; with each death tying fast to her ankles like weights. I could see the curse physically taking its toll, in the wrinkles that carved around her eyes and across her forehead; in the slowness of her arms and legs, as if she was moving with the atrophy of the accumulated weight. 

But what did the O’ Sullivans know about *family*? Except for how to steal it.

\*\*

The air inside the small clochán chapel was thick with the scent of salt and damp stone. The altar, carved from dark, water-stained oak, stood at the far end and was adorned with half-melted candles and a tattered cloth that swayed gently in the wind. 

*Of course*, our car had broken down at the end of the drive, forcing us to run through sheets of rain. Soaking, I’d finally stumbled through the small front door, my lace dress twisting around my ankles. In the heavy salt air; I felt like a fish tossed onto the shore, floundering and gasping for air. 

Donal was already here. He was standing in the back with the priest, next to the altar.

The candles on the altar flickered wildly, tossed about by the wind that rushed in. The light twisted around him, the kaleidoscopic shadows writhing like living beings. My breath caught in my throat. For a second… Donal didn’t look like himself. 

He looked distorted. I swallowed hard. As if I were looking at him through dark water. 

But his eyes lit up, as he spotted me. My heart clenched, and I forced a smile to mirror his, though it felt fragile on my lips. My thoughts whirled like the wind outside; and I watched the priest wave his hands wildly, his voice ringing off the damp stone. My mother, her lips pursed, walked back towards them. 

There it was again, that *feeling*. Like seasickness. I couldn’t stop myself as once again, my thoughts swam back to her. The Selkie. My great-great-great-great-great grandmother.

I grimaced, and itched the patch of eczema on my elbow. Was this the same kind of storm that had hurled her ashore all those years ago? The same storm that had, in the end, called her back to the sea? I watched as Donal crossed over to me, casting more flickering shadows in his wake, and I forced those thoughts from my head. I swallowed nervously. Again. 

*I’d tossed the cloak in the water, damnit. The skin had returned home.* 

Behind the altar, and beyond the chapel’s arched windows, the vast expanse of the sea stretched endlessly, the waves crashing violently against the rocks below. 

“What’s going on with the priest?” I asked, my voice barely audible over the howling wind as Donal pulled me tightly against his chest.

“Mhmm,” he murmured, his breath warm against my hair as he rocked me gently. “He’s freaking out. He wants us to leave. It’s flooding back there.” I pulled back and glanced around. He was right. The water was rising, creeping in from the edges of the chapel. Small waves lapped at the base of the altar, their frothy edges glinting in the dim candlelight. The priest and my mother stood in the water, their hands gesturing wildly. 

“Remind me again why your mother wanted us to get married here?” Donal asked, his voice tinged with amusement. I laugh, the anxiety easing inside me like a balloon deflating. “Because this is where Seamus found the Selkie. According to the family curse, anyway.”

“Ahhh, the curse,” he says, pulling me back into a hug. He smells warm, like cedar and salt. “No offense, but I think your mother’s gonna be the death of us long before the curse gets its turn.” I laugh again, the weight on my chest lifting a little. But I couldn’t help but flinch, as another wave smashed against the cliffside, with a force that shook the chapel’s foundation. 

This *is* supposedly where Seamus found the Selkie. According to the legends at least: 

*A' phuing as àirde, air a' bhearradh as àirde. Far an do choinnich a' mhuir ris an speur, chaidh creutair na mara ri ghlacadh air tìr. “*The highest point, on the tallest cliff. Where the sea met the sky, did the creature of the deep become trapped on human feet.”

I pictured her dark hair, her curls the same as mine, twisted and matted from the storm. Her seal skin, bleached white from the water, draped around her like a wedding dress. My stomach hollowed at the thought. 

I sneak a look behind me,  My mother’s face is flushed, her hands gesturing wildly. My heart drops. I know that look, unfortunately. We’re not leaving this chapel until the priest agrees to marry us, no matter how high the water rises.

Suddenly, a deafening crash shakes the chapel. My breath rushes from my lungs. “The waves-” I whisper. I start to pull back, but Donal doesn’t let me. Instead, he pulls me tighter against him. “Have I ever told you that my family is cursed too?” Donal says, his voice soft but steady.

“I- what?” I lean back, surprised, but he holds my gaze. “Cursed to be in love,” he adds, a faint smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Ugh,” I groan, rolling my eyes. I try to relax and sink into his warmth, but the tension in my chest holds firm, winding tighter with each increasingly loud crash.

“Mhmm,” He murmurs, and then is quiet for a moment. “*Teach solais sa stoirm*,” his words low and almost lost in the wind. “My father always said that we were lighthouses in the storm.”

“That’s beautiful,” I whisper, my throat tightening. “Mhmm,” he hums again, pressing a kiss to the top of my forehead. “Except not in this one.” He sighs and gently untangles himself from me. “Let me go see if I can get this priest to marry us.”

But as he turns around, he pulls out his phone, and my breath catches. The screen lights up, illuminating his face in the dim room, and I see it—dozens of missed calls, a flood of notifications, all silenced. My stomach twists as the realization hits me: his phone, *my* phone too, had been on silent the entire time. The air grows heavy, suffocating, as the weight of what we’d overlooked settles over me. The warning signs had been there, flashing in bold, red letters, screaming for our attention. And we’d missed every single one. 

The storm was too strong. My stomach dropped, and my lungs felt like they’d been crushed in a vice. *Damn* Seamus and this curse. *Damn* this storm too. 

“Donal-” I wheezed, reaching for him, my breath still escaping me. My mind whirled, as wild as the wind outside. *We needed to leave, the waves were-* 

\*\* 

It happened in an instant. 

The wave appeared out of nowhere–a towering, monstrous wall of water–and crashed into the back of the chapel. The sound was deafening—a cacophony of splintering wood, shattering stone, and the roaring sea. Saltwater sprayed into the air, drenching everything in its path.

Freezing water rushed in, swirling to my knees. I stood frozen, the scene unfolding as if in slow motion. The back of the chapel was… *gone*. The sea roared through the gaping hole, framing the chaos beyond. 

For a horrible, gut-wrenching moment; I felt like I was at the altar, not with Donal, but with the storm itself. Lightning split the heavens, bearing witness to our union. The wind howled through the opening, the rain slashing sideways, and the sea surged higher, claiming the space where Donal had stood.

“Donal!” I screamed, my voice lost in the chaos. 

The world, *my* world, narrows to a single, horrifying moment, as I watch Donal’s silhouetted figure disappear over the side of the cliff. 

*Please dear God, no, no, nono, no-* “DONAL!” I scream again, my voice raw and breaking, but the storm swallows that too. I hear the cries of my mother and the priest, from where they’d been tossed in the wreckage of the chapel, and I rush forward, my feet slipping on the wet stone. 

Enormous waves crashed beyond the cliff. It was utter madness below. My lighthouse was down *there*, and I could feel the weight of the end of the world pressing down on me. I knelt there, trembling, my hands clawing at the jagged rocks as they crumbled into the sea below me.

Then suddenly, my fingers found something soft. My breath hitched in my throat. 

Unnaturally soft. My hands stilled, and for a moment, I couldn’t move. The wind screamed around me, the rain lashing at my face, but all I could focus on was the strange, yielding surface beneath my knees. I pressed my fingers into it again, trying to make sense of it. 

It felt like… cloth. 

My heart thudded in my chest as I slowly curled my fingers around the edge of… whatever it was. It clung to the ground, waterlogged and stubborn, but I pulled at it, my movements clumsy and desperate. A flash of lightning split the sky. What was in my hands was illuminated for a brief, blinding second. 

In that single, searing moment, I realized what it was.

I saw it every night before sleep claimed me, and again in those fleeting, lucid moments just before waking. It haunted me through every storm, its presence threaded into the restless waves that churned beyond the edges of my village. I had dared to believe it was gone forever, that I’d seen the last of it when I cast it back into the sea.

The cloak. 

My stomach dropped, and a cold, sickening realization washed over me, sharper than the freezing rain and more violent than the waves crashing below. 

The curse wasn’t broken. 

The wind howled in my ears, and the waves thundered below, their voices merging into a single, deafening cry. The storm was no longer outside me—it was in me, tearing through my chest, ripping apart the walls I’d built to keep it out. The rain wasn’t falling; it was flaying, stripping me bare. The wind howled, not around me, but through me. My skin burned, not from the cold, but from the storm’s relentless assault, peeling back the layers of my skin.

The sea roared, its voice a deafening, insistent call, and I realized, with a shuddering breath, that I was answering. My feet moved without thought, my body drawn to the cliff’s edge, to the chaos below. The wind screamed in my ears, the rain slashed at my face, and for a moment, I wasn’t sure if I was falling or flying. 

Then the waves rose to meet me, and I gave myself to them, to the storm, to the sea.

\*\*

Donal woke with a start, saltwater burning his throat as he spat it onto the sand. 

His body felt like it had been dragged through hell and back, every muscle screaming in protest. He pushed himself up, his vision swimming, and scanned the rocky beach. Debris littered the shore—shattered wood, torn fabric. His chest tightened. 

“Aiofe!” he croaked, his voice raw. No answer. Just the soft hiss of waves and the patter of rain.

Then he noticed it—a band of seaweed, dark and slimy, wrapped tightly around his ring finger, coiled like a eel. He stared at it, his breath hitching, his lungs burning. His fingers trembled as he tried to peel it away, but it clung stubbornly, as if it belonged there.

That’s when he saw her.

Out in the water, impossibly far, stood a figure. His breath hitched. “Aiofe?” he called, louder this time, his voice cracking. Didn’t move. Just stood there, watching, her wedding dress glowing white against the gray sea, the water lapping at her waist. But it was too deep. She should’ve been drowning.

“Aiofe!” he shouted, stumbling toward the water. His legs gave out, and he fell to his knees. “What are you—?” His voice broke as she began to sink, the water rising around her like it was claiming her. “No, no, no—Aiofe, don’t!”

Her face was calm, almost peaceful, as the sea swallowed her whole. For a moment, her hand broke the surface, pale and trembling, and that’s when he saw it—a band of seaweed, just like his, wrapped around her ring finger.

“No,” he whispered, his voice breaking. “No, no, no—” Her hand lingered for a heartbeat, as if reaching for him, before it, too, disappeared beneath the waves.

Donal stared at the empty water, his chest heaving. He looked down at his own hand, at the seaweed coiled around his finger, and let out a sob. “Come back,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the rain. “Please… come back.”

But the sea didn’t answer.
