Let me tell you about a place not far from here, where the wind whispers tales of greed and misfortune. Back when I was a young boy, prospectors struck gold in these parts. News spread like wildfire, and men with calloused hands and dollar signs in their eyes descended upon the valley like hungry zombies.

Overnight, Deadwood Creek sprang up. This shantytown, built of rough-cut timber, housed dreams wilder than a bucking bronco. The town was ruled by John Morgan, a powerful man as imposing as a redwood and meaner than a rattlesnake. He drove his men hard, deeper and deeper into the mountain's belly, fuelled by his insatiable greed.

Gold nuggets the size of your fist poured from the mountain's veins, enough to turn a man delirious. But as you know, there's no gold rush town around here anymore. Only a legend remains.

My grandpa whispered this legend to me, a warning never to go near the valley. It spoke of a sleeping spirit, a guardian of the mountain's riches. One day, a widow dressed in black, her face marked by a prominent mole, approached Mr. Morgan. She tried to warn him the ancient legend, to warn him of the White Buffalo, a spirit older than time itself.

According to the Lakota people, the White Buffalo guarded the valley's riches, ensuring only those who took what they needed with respect were rewarded. But greed, her grandfather warned, was a hungry wolf. He spoke of a miner named Jedidiah Thorn who scoffed at the legend.

One fateful night, fuelled by greed, Jedidiah's pickaxe carved a destructive path into the heart of the mountain. The earth roared in protest as a monstrous White Buffalo charged from the darkness of the mine shaft, its eyes burning like embers from the depths of hell. The mighty Buffalo charged at the greedy miner, the ground swallowing Jedidiah and his men whole. Its unearthly bellow echoed through the valley, a cold reminder that the mountains hold secrets and the great spirit protects its own with a fury as fierce as the wind itself.

"Legends are for fools!" Mr. Morgan scoffed at the old hag, as he downed another glass of whiskey. "Pride comes before a fall," they say, and for Mr. Morgan, his pride would be his final undoing.

One moonless night, the earth groaned beneath the town's people. A tremor shook Deadwood Creek to its core, collapsing the mine entrance. Screams erupted from the rubble, but they faded quickly. Blinded by greed, Mr. Morgan had ordered his men to dig deeper without considering an emergency shaft. He and half his crew vanished in the blink of an eye.

The few survivors who crawled out of the mine were pale-faced and gibbering. Young men, barely out of their prime, looked like they'd returned from an apocalypse. They spoke of a monstrous roar and a chilling wind that seemed to come from the very heart of the earth.

Deadwood Creek became a ghost town overnight. The fear in those men's eyes was enough to send everyone else fleeing back from whence they came.  Claims were abandoned, cabins left to rot.  Some say you can still hear the clink of pickaxes chipping at the mountain and the slosh of dented pans, eternally searching for their masters gold - a grim reminder of their greed.

Listen closely on lonely nights when the wind howls. I sometimes come out to this forest, hoping to catch a glimpse of the trapped souls. Not long ago, my worst fear came true. I heard the chilling echoes of pickaxes digging into nothingness. Distant lights flickered in the darkness, and shadows shuffled along the mountain ridge in a military line, forever searching for the gold that claimed their lives.

Remember, some treasures aren't worth the price. Let the mountains keep their secrets.
