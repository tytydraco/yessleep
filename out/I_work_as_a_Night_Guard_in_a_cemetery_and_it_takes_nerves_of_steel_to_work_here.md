 Enjoy.

Jacob has taken his training in stride. I was worried that after his first couple weeks of training that he had just lucked out in not having to witness the horrors that can happen to trespassers but he still showed up the next night after witnessing Mr. Weber feast.

My town does not get many vagrants that blow into town. It is a long road into town with a lot of nothing between us and the rest of civilization. Even our nearest town is a 30 minute drive with a lead foot risking a speeding ticket from state troopers.

When someone comes to town that is visibly at the end of their rope it is common to see people try and offer a helping hand to assist in pulling them out of a funk. My father had made a wrong turn down a road when he was a young man, lost and unsure of his lot in life. When he arrived the town welcomed him and it wasn’t long before he married my mother and had me in tow 6 months after their wedding.

Hearing that someone had driven into town in a vehicle that was held together with zip ties, super glue, and faith finally lost its religion as he pulled into the gas station on the edge of town. His own faith had been in that of a neon nod that brought dreams of technicolor angels that erased the memories of a past he wanted to forget

When the gas attendant finally looked up from his book and noticed the car parked across three parking spots he went out to see what was going on. A phone call later the man was dragged to a jail cell, the last of the heroin shot up but remnants of abuse raced up his arms.

Released back onto the streets, sober but with nothing, the vagrant prowled the streets in the same way the spirits prowled the cemetery. The deacon of the town’s Lutheran Church offered to put the man up in a motel, the pastor of the town’s Baptist Church gave the man food and an open invitation to the Wednesday and Friday AA/NA meetings. The owner of Aunt Sally’s Secondhand Clothes had brought a week's worth of clothing and a part-time job until the man could get back on his feet without stumbling over.

For the first couple weeks the man was taking the first steps to what could have been a long life in our town as the newest citizen to set roots in a place they did not intend to settle down in.

I don’t know where he found more LSD, or why he decided that the best place to go to avoid his new landlord and sponsor was the cemetery.

In the end, as he stumbled through the cemetery unable to tell what was real what wasn't. This final trip was bad in every conceivable way.

Jacob and I had initially ignored the man who was howling, as he looked no different than many of the souls that stagger and howl towards a moon shrouded by the trees.

It wasn't until the howls became screams that our attention was drawn and the spider I now knew as Mr. Weber wrapped his rusty tongue around the vagrant's arm before biting down with broken shards of teeth. Hairy appendages pierced his feet to the ground and forced his mouth wide. A second mouth unleashed clouds of bile and spiders into the screaming man. 

Shambling from their hiding spots, a dozen dripping spectres of decay and disgust howled at the latest lost soul to beckon their call. Mr. Weber did not appreciate the reinforcement and a sweeping arm swiped at the enclosing horde.

Squirming from the horde, a large maggot opened its mouth revealing rows of slomy fingers. The maggot swallowed Mr. Weber and the vagrant from below. Mr. Weber gave a wide smile as he was engulfed as pleasure and pain swallowed them both whole.

Despite the site, Jacob remained silent and calm, panic etched in his face as his body shook with fright.

With nothing to clean we walked away and walked in silence as the night gave way to dawn.

The vagrant’s disappearance was noted by the people of the town that had begun to grow close to him. When his fall back into addiction was noted and his trip to the cemetery was spoken the atmosphere of worry was replaced with the town surplus of apathy.

Jacob and Thomas have both taken to the call of the cemetery. Their devotion to the vow of silence and procedure of cleaning the remains of those who break the silence has been admirable. I know that when the time comes they will both be able to keep guard and eventually bring in the new generation of watchmen of the night.

The cemetery director has asked if Jacob is ready to enter into the rotation and with a glowing approval he will officially end his training.

After a continued debate, we will hold off on requiring three guards a night until he finds a couple more people to hire on.

I plan on taking full advantage of this opportunity and try to take a long needed vacation. I have been wanting to travel for a long time. My entire life I have lived in my small town, only leaving the state a handful of times as a child.

It would be nice to see the world outside of where I grew up.

Although people will leave the town after they have moved in, it is a rarity to see. There isn’t much reason to leave a place where tiny miracles happen all the time for a place where fortune always seems to find someone else.

Isaac and Kyle are of the same opinion, a chance for a break would be nice. Knowing Kyle, he will likely do nothing more than sleep and eat an ungodly amount of junk food while watching endless reruns of NCIS and CSI:Miami. Isaac on the other hand would prefer a chance to go out and see the world like he did when he was in the Navy. Preferably before he is too old to really enjoy it.

He deserves it.

A moment’s reprieve from the nightmares we face every night.
