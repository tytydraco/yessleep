I've been a monster hunter for the past three decades. With the uptick in recruitment here in Appalachia- partly thanks to the ongoing Helene aftermath- I’ve been asked to mentor a few of you.

Let me be straight with you: I work with rookies and veterans alike. I’m not here to bark orders or play drill sergeant. I'm more than happy to start off friendly, I just ask that you return the good will. That said, this is the same spiel my mentor gave me when I joined up. It’s saved more lives than I can count- mine included.

Today we’ll start with the Ten Rules, though we'll have to get to rule ten's Protocols later this week. You can’t learn it all at once, but I know you’re itching to get into the field. Just don’t go rushing ahead until you’ve got these drilled and memorized.

Hunting, at its core, is about trade-offs. The more time you spend preparing, the better your odds of surviving the encounter ahead. But that’s more time your target gets to carve up civilians. Spend more money equipping your crew, and you might finish faster- but you're bleeding your payout before the job even starts. Too many rookies burn bright on their first big hunt only to be hunted by debt collectors a month or two later. The math isn’t hard. If your payout doesn’t cover your bullets and your bandages, you’re in the red. You do that a few times, and the job’s no longer your job.

There’s more, but you get the point. No decision is small. Civilian life gives you margin for error- run your car on half a tank, forget your umbrella, sleep in past your alarm. Out here, those same habits are how you wind up dead. Every veteran hunter’s got a full tank and a jerry can. Not because they like gas fumes, but because there's a few too many mimics running back-road stations.

I’m not here to scare you. You’re already here, which tells me something broke for you- either something personal or something permanent. Whatever your reason, welcome to the wrong side of the veil. This job doesn’t come with medals or parades. It comes with knowledge you wish you could forget and people you never will. We do this work so others don’t have to. The best hunts are the ones nobody knows happened.

I want you to survive. To be another long-standing ally in this war. Learn the rules. Memorize the protocols. Drill them until they’re reflexive, because once you are in a position to need these rules, you won’t always have time to think.

Let’s start with the basics. Some old fart fifty years ago saw the mortality rate of his fellow hunters and figured there should be a handbook, or something. Fella went and wrote up his own Ten Commandments. Turns out, he was right, and since the guild adopted these, we have a whole sixty percent of hunters making it to retirement. Tripled what it used to be.

**Rule 1. The Heat of the Hunt Should Be on Your Terms- and as Short as Possible**

You have seven phases in every hunt:

1. Contract Procurement. 
2. Crew Assembly. 
3. Discovery. 
4. Preparation. 
5. Calm of the Hunt. 
6. Heat of the Hunt. 
7. Cleanup.

The Heat starts the moment your target knows you’re there, and it ends when one of you is dead.

Forget what the movies taught you. You don’t square up like a knight with a dragon. You don’t strut in and say something clever. If your first move isn’t at least a crippling blow, start making peace with your maker. Monsters aren’t dumb. They’ve survived generations of angry mobs, torch-wielding villagers, even tactical teams. If it weren’t for our planning and knowledge, we’d still be prey. Even with it, we can only keep populations in check. Every second it knows about you is another second it’s preparing to make you a meal, so keep things short and sweet.

**Rule 2. Buy With the Future in Mind**

Don’t buy gear like one of those tacti-cool larpers. No one cares if you look like a Navy Seal if you can’t afford to reload next month. In fact, guys that show up kitted out in fresh camo and mall ninja gear scare the hikers and draw the wrong kind of attention. You want to look normal, blend in. I’m not saying fight in flip-flops- but maybe don’t buy the $800 tactical vest with a flag patch and a Latin slogan.

And don’t let the sales reps fool you: “top-shelf” doesn’t mean “won’t break.” Some of my worst gear failures came from stuff I paid too much for. Ask around. See what other hunters trust.

I’ll give you an example- For the average odd Raven Mocker, I bring:

* Salt
* Mirrored camera
* Infrared scanner
* Silver bullets
* Crushed quartz powder

Most of that overlaps with other threats. Salt’s your best friend- buy it in bulk, use it generously. Same with quartz, powdered or not- it helps with many of the older nasties, so buy a supplier bag from one of those fill-a-bag gem wholesalers. Silver’s expensive, so I melt down old silverware from garage sales. I learned how to make my own ammo early on- it's kinda therapeutic. As for mirrored cameras, some things can’t be seen directly, only through reflections. The nice ones break just as fast as the cheap ones, so I carry spares. On the flip side, my thermal scanner’s been used as a club more times than I care to count, and it still works. Don’t just think about this hunt. Think about the next five.

**Rule 3. Strike When They’re Home- Not Hunting**

This one sounds backward. You wouldn’t attack a human in their bunker, right? But here’s the thing: humans rest in their safe zones. Cryptids *hunt* in theirs. If you can catch a cryptid just as it returns to its den- exhausted, digesting, or cocooned- you’ve got the upper hand. The sole exception to this rule is in the case of witches, but we’ll address that when we get to rule seven.

Anyways, this rule assumes it has a den. Some don’t. But for the ones that do, it’s better to breach their lair than to cross them while they’re hunting. They’re still dangerous in their nests, sure- but they’re not *active* yet. Get in, strike hard, strike fast, and don’t linger. Just don’t confuse “safer” with “easier.”

**Rule 4. If You Have to Engage in the Wild, Prioritize Your Escape**

Maybe you’re dealing with a spirit, demon, or some other ethereal jack-wagon. Some things *only* exist in attack-mode. Whether you’re cleaning out a haunted farm-house, dealing with a hockey masked tank, or you're sent to deal with some cult sacrificing to a knockoff god- you’re gonna find that second and third attempts are more of a necessity than a backup plan. So the rule’s simple: make sure you’re able to get away, stay alert, set up diversions, and take the first opportunity to use one of your escape routes.

If you have the luxury of jumping your target at a location of your choosing, go there when it's safe long before your hunt and learn it like the back of your hand. Ladders, exit doors, roads, etc. Take into account which way you need to park your car. If there’s a gate, assess how strong it is. If there’s a chainlink fence, go ahead and cut it. 

One time I was having to lure a rabid not-deer into a field for my crew mate to get a clean shot. I had found out it liked rotten meat, so I breadcrumbed some expired chicken into a cleared valley where we could post up on a nearby rock formation. We’d gotten so used to the smell by that point of the day that it didn’t occur to us that our ziplock bag and rubber gloves didn’t do the best job of keeping the smell off of us. Next thing we knew, there was a fanged bi-pedal ruminant coming at us from twenty yards away. If I hadn’t set up tripwires, it would have killed us. If my buddy hadn’t poured out a perimeter of gasoline and rigged a cheap ignition system, it would have killed us. If we didn’t rent dirtbikes and keep them by our post… you get the picture.

We got it the second hunt, but rule four made sure we *had* a second hunt.

**Rule 5. Establish Rendezvous Points Every Trip**

Before you ever set foot in the field- whether it’s during discovery, preparation, or the hunt itself- you establish a primary and a secondary rendezvous point. Both must be accessible by vehicle. Neither should be downwind of the other.

You’ll hear more about how they’re used when we go over rule ten’s protocols, but for now, know this: they’re one of the most crucial parts of your plan. Fixed points, built into your pre-hunt preparation, that your crew can fall back to if Capt. Murphy chimes in. And call this rule 5B, courtesy of your now dearly loved mentor, they’re not fortified positions either. If something has you running to your rendezvous point, rule four should be the only thing going through your mind.

Choosing them isn’t guesswork, either. Don’t just slap two pins on a map and call it done. Learn to read topographical lines, consider elevation, cover, travel time, and wind direction- not just the prevailing wind, but how it changes with the terrain. A ridgeline and a hollow move air in completely different ways.

I recommend picking up a local almanac and studying it alongside the maps. Same goes for learning how to read contour lines and drainage patterns. You don’t have to become any kind of -ologist, but knowing the difference between a reliable route and a seasonal floodplain can make a world of difference. Hell, our training is done by noon most days, sit in for a few classes at the local university, your guild card works at any of the state funded ones if you have to scan in.

**Rule 6. Not Every Cryptid is a Monster** 

Cryptids, anomalies, whatever it is that isn’t human or animal- just because we don’t get how they exist doesn’t mean we gotta kill them. Monster hunters. That's what we are, that's what we focus on. Monsters. If the thing isn’t a threat to humans, ignore it or see if it can help. We don’t even bother with not-deer unless they go feral like the one I was telling you about.

Make it emotional, make it practical, whatever. In practice, it's a bit of both. The situation is that we are outnumbered and fighting a game of preservation. Preserve a standard of safety, ignorance, and civilization's current progression. If the urbanization of China in the past century has taught us anything, it's that the worst of the cryptids only go away when there’s no unseen place. If you think national parks, forests, and land-trusts are a good thing then you’ve already committed to the status quo. So with all that said, recognize that we can’t afford to make enemies, we have limited time and narrowed priorities, and we could even stand to have a few more allies.

I’ll be honest with you. This was the hardest rule for me to learn. My parents were slau- … they were taken from me by a werewolf one of the neighbor’s kids turned into after being kidnapped. It was more than predators doing what they do, it was a knowing and deliberate placement of a living bomb into our sleepy town by a werewolf terrorist organization- as insane as that concept sounds. Mindless beasts or calculated terrorizers, that's what the unseen world was to me from day 1. So imagine my anger when I found out that the guild rehabilitates and utilizes them. At the end of the day, though, I realized that just because something’s not human anymore doesn’t mean it can’t be a major asset- especially when our recruitment numbers drop the better a job we do. Oh- and, uh... just don’t waste your time on non-hostiles. I mean- hell, I don’t know. You’ll learn this better in the field.

**Rule 7. Not Every Monster is a Cryptid**

You’ll see plenty of freaks in this line of work. The shocking stuff fades quick. What sticks- what haunts most hunters long after- is how often the worst monsters end up being human.

You may never run across this, but you’ll hear stories float around the guild at some point in your time working. Bodies, mangled and dumped in weird locations. A crew gets sent out to track a suspected skinwalker, beast, or devil. They come back quiet. A few days later, a news article drops: serial killer, caught in the same area.

If you ever find out that your target isn’t what you think it is, but is instead some psycho- you have to hand it over to law enforcement. I get it, we want justice- even though we're monster hunters and some humans fall to that title- you'll want justice. But so will the families of the dead. You can take that justice for yourself, or you can give the families something they haven’t had since it started. A name. A face. Closure. 

Witches fall under rule seven too. Most *real* witches, not those Etsy store types, get so into certain practices that they turn into something otherworldly- like those raven mockers I mentioned earlier. The joke’s on them, though, because it robs enough of their humanity to make them predictable enough to kill repeatedly. But a rare few? They walk the line. They keep their soul just long enough to hold onto what makes humans dangerous. Humans plan with patience and co-ordination, three traits that any creature has only one of. They have a “den” but don’t *ever* go there. Their homes- huts- whatevers- are warded, glyphed, surveiled, and rigged six ways to kill you. You will never get the drop on them there.

Rule seven has one implication to witches. Don’t treat them the same as the last. Each one needs a specialist on the team and a priest ready to perform a funeral- or several. If you see a contract for one- as a favor to me, don’t take a second look at it. Leave it to the psychos who make a name off of killing those freaks.

**Rule 8. Don’t Ruin the Magic**

Recruitment drops when we’re doing our job right. That’s because every time we tear the veil- whether through absence or negligence- we force someone to stop living in blissful self-determinism. If they see the truth, that truth gives them a new life goal: "make me the last one to suffer that way."

You may be thinking- “what's the harm in telling someone? I could give them caution and maybe a few rules to live by and they’ll be safer than they were.” That may be true for some of the monsters, but not most of them. 

I want you to think back to when you were still ignorant- I don’t know if you were religious, but even if you were, odds are you didn’t put much stock in the spiritual world physically impacting reality *today*. “Maybe long ago,” you’d think, “but the world is now mundane.” That’s more than a veil in a figurative sense- that's a literal veil of protection that the old Catholic church worked up. Turns out- demons, ghosts, most spiritual beings- spirits have as much power over you as you think they do. Some old exorcist found this out and the old monolith of an organization made a judgement call. Letting someone know about our world, the *real* world, is basically creating a victim in waiting. 

What about witches? A wise old civilian once said, “the reason we stopped killing witches is because we realized there were no such things. If we thought they existed, people willingly doing the will of the devil, it would be right to seek them out and remove them.” He was right in his conclusion, but that doesn’t change the fact that people are sloppy in their execution. We’d see puritanical witch trails all over again- and I promise you they wouldn’t kill any actual witches. 

I could go on about more examples- but again, you’ll learn more as you get field experience.

**Rule 9. Check Your Oil and Ask For a Second Opinion**

Yeah, this is about your car- but it’s also about your gear, your prep, your crew’s readiness, your skill level, and most importantly, *yourself*. Your body. Your brain.

I mentioned earlier that sixty percent of us make it to retirement. Of the forty percent who don’t, only about a quarter are killed by a monster. The rest? Heart attacks. Suicides. About half and half. Mostly preventable deaths.

That tells you something. These rules work. They protect us from the things we’re sent to kill. But what they *can’t* always save you from... is you.

We don’t have claws or bulletproof skin. No blood magic, just a few wards. No super-speed. What we’ve got is humanity. It's our greatest strength- but also our greatest liability. We push through pain. We downplay warning signs. We think if we say we’re not okay, we’ll be the weak link or a burden. So we stay quiet. And then we die.

Not on my crew. As long as you're learning from me, you’re seeing a doctor *twice a year* and doing what they tell you. You take the meds if they prescribe them. You take the break if they recommend one. If your joints ache, I’ll swap you to comms. If your head’s not in it, we don’t roll out. It’s not coddling. It’s maintenance. You can’t protect anyone else if you’re falling apart from the inside out.

But here’s the thing: I can’t make you *talk*. I can’t force you to tell me what’s keeping you up at night. So all I ask of you is: stop and check your oil- every hunt, before and after. And if you need a second opinion, I’m happy to be your guy.

**Rule 10. Respect Capt. Murphy, Learn His Protocols- He’s on Every Hunt**

You’ll mess up. The best crews still miss signs. The best-laid plans still trip on pure bad luck. I don’t say this to discourage you. I say it so you stop thinking your checklist is enough. When it’s not, that’s when protocols save your life. Capt. Murphy has been chirping in on hunts since people first started hunting- he screws up the plan and that's the one thing going for us. Luckily, Capt. Murphy has some protocols- plans in a bottle with glass that says "break if an emergency!" Okay, that's enough of the sales pitch.

Rule ten is a lot longer- about as long as rules one through nine, but I’ll go over all the protocols lists tomorrow or later this week with you. You’ve already got a lot to commit to memory. There will be a test first thing in the morning and then one every week till you lead your first hunt. I know that sounds like a pain in the ass, but trust me- I still go over all ten each time I take a new contract. I’m trying to get that retirement percentage up and you've got to help me with that goal- so forgive me if I drill the rules into you.

At the end of today, if you can only remember one thing, just remember: hunting is composed of trade-offs. These rules will help you navigate those trade-offs, but even these rules will be pitted against each other. I’ve had to throw out every one of these at least once to save my skin. And yeah- I paid for it.

But I’m still here to hunt those damn monsters.
