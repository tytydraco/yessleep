I know that I'm not allowed to post this because of, "mass hysteria" or whatever, but I think I've had it with living after our most recent discovery.

so for context. I work in government facility somewhere in the middle of Wyoming. it's the best place for my field of work after all. No light pollution and no one around to get in the way.

as an astronomer I'm generally not finding many new things because it all takes millions of years to even happen.

but tonight was different.

I was looking up at a relatively new star right above the constellation of Orion, simply observing it to determine the size and distance using the simulator.

this star happens to be of great interest among my small team because we discovered almost every single necessary element of life somewhere in the system.

it was 10:27 pm in Wyoming and I've noticed something strange in the system's measurements.

all of the planets are just gone.

and the brightness of the star shot up out of nowhere.

it wasn't even big enough to go supernova.

it made no sense.

I tried rebooting the system to see if it was just a malfunction, but no it's really just changed instantly.

I called up our research manager, David to talk about what I had just seen and long story short he didn't believe me.

he just said, "This is on a cosmic scale, that much stuff can't just disappear and brighten." and that I should, "go home for the night it's probably fatigue causing you to look at the wrong numbers, hell even the wrong star."

I sat at my desk, considering what he said when suddenly all the stars in the sky dim and then go completely dark.

the sky is blacker than black as if tiny holes in the sky were covered with thick duct tape.

the insanity of this event left me restless all night.

luckily the deep silence was interrupted by my phone.

I picked up and David answered.

he told me that NASA picked up a message from both voyager probes.

the stars aren't disappearing they're blinking.

the stars are moving.

they're alive.

if you've ever seen those pictures of accurate angels, it's pretty damn spot on.

all the telescopes are showing massive solar system sized eyes with massive rings orbiting around them.

any planets in the systems the "angels" spawned from were consumed by the now massive creatures.

I was completely panicking, what do you do when everything you know flips on it's head.

I desperately looked for a source but all I could find was that the gravitational force at the great attractor doubled in intensity.

every galaxy had recently started moving faster.

so fast that andromeda was no longer moving towards us but away.

we are perfectly positioned to not be able to see the great attractor so it's impossible to tell.

but all those years in Sunday school learning about the horrifying power of old testament God, led me to believe that this is him.

God was tearing apart the universe.

against everything I stood for as a scientist something in me knew that this was him.

star systems in every direction have become God's world destroying army.

for now our star remains as such.

but we can only escape his view for so long.

eventually our world will be burned away like the rest.

but while we're still here we need to fix global warming.

Because, god damn the sun is beating down on me more and more recently.
