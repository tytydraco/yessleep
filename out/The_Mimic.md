I’m a police officer and have been for 3 years so in no way am I a rookie, I say this because the other officers have never seen me as an equal, maybe due to them all being over 40 and having known each other for years so they usually don’t listen to me and I’ve even heard them mocking me behind my back.

For the past 6 months an elderly lady has come down to the station every week sometimes multiple times a week to deliver us home baked donuts, the first time she came in with the donuts she was very kind and soft spoken but easy to talk to, despite this, everyone down at the station was suspicious, with good reason, and we thoroughly analyzed the treats for any signs of contamination, all analises came out clean and there was enough for most of the officers to enjoy, I’m allergic to gluten to I never tried them.

This went on for the next six months with my coworkers being ecstatic every time that lady walked through the door. Last week was the last time she came in and it went like usual, the lady walked through the door, everyone turned their head and got up excitedly to greet her already expecting the baked goods, and boy did she deliver.

Maybe an hour or so later I was sat at my desk with my partner Shelly sat down at hers behind me, for the last five minutes she had been complaining about a pain in her chest and eyes and a couple of other officers had been complaining of dizziness and nausea, five minutes later I was distracted by Shelly’s heaving and forceful breathing, I turned around instinctively and tried to console her, thats when she began to violently regurgitate all over her keyboard and monitor, she collapsed on the floor and continued to throw up until she eventually lost consciousness, by then all the officers were surrounding us so while one officer called an ambulance the rest of us carried her into the break room.

Officer Tom stopped and stood frozen, while some of us looked back he said-

“Something’s not right”

His mouth clearly holding back the thick liquid that was building up, out of breath like he had just ran a marathon, he put his head in his hands and a few seconds later he fell to his knees and began to violently vomit as well clutching his stomach as he did. First Tom, then George, then Mike, then Sully, then Justin, then Eve, then Todd. The ambulance didn’t have room for all of them so more had to be called.

A few days later the autopsies came back showing traces of cyanide in their systems and I immediately knew what had happened. All night we restlessly scoured, hunting that lady like animals only for no traces of her existence to be found, we knocked on doors put out posters but everyone we came across told us they had never seen us, we live in a small town so this is not normal.

I got home that night exhausted but for some reason I knew in my head I would be unable to sleep, maybe it was the feeling of guilt that after searching all night I hadn’t found the person, no, the monster responsible for those stolen lives. 

I made my way into the living room being distracted from my thoughts by the sound of the curtains blowing in the wind, the window was open, wide open almost shamelessly, I never leave my windows open not even when at home. After standing there for a few seconds looking at the window, my heart frozen like the rest of my body I began to walk towards it to close it and once done I throughly searched my apartment looking for an intruder, with every room I searched my heart getting lighter and lighter thinking everything was fine. 

I made it to my bedroom and that’s when my heart stopped again, there was a frantically taped up box sitting on my bed. I turned on the lights and walked towards my bedside table where I keep a switchblade in the drawer but I hesitated before opening it just staring at it, zoning out as my mind came up with all sorts of terrifying thoughts.

I dragged the blade across the tape my hands shaking as I did, my head was pounding with anxiety and the thought that it could be a bomb completely missed me. What I saw inside was sickening. Prosthetics, makeup prosthetics the type you see actors wear in movies but I recognized that face, it was the old lady, someone had been pretending to be an old lady slowing gaining the trust of the officers at the station throughout those six months just to take their lives.

That same night I didn’t rest a second, I brought the box down to the station and stayed there all night, six weeks later nothing had come up. Yesterday a man was brought into the station after chasing down an old lady with a knife, I was asked to interrogate the man and did so walking into the room and almost being pushed out the door by the stench. The room smelt like gasoline urine and burned flesh, the man however sat there, his arms crossed on the table and his head submerged in them.

I walked back out closing the door behind me and asked the other officers about the man, they told me they were unable to identify him due to the fact he had burned his fingerprints off and most of his face, when they tried to check dental records they realized the man had no teeth. He was a ghost, completely nonexistent if not for the fact he sat in the next room over, waiting for me. 

I took a deep, shaky breath in and walked back into the room, the smell now being familiar but just as repulsive. The sound of the heavy door slamming shut didn’t seem to startle the man, he looked like a mannequin. I sat down and introduced myself, I was expecting and slightly hoping for no response from the man until he slowly lifted his head up as if it was painful for him and I tried so hard to hide my utter disgust.

The little flesh he had still clinging onto his skull in charred, leathery layers was severely burned, third degree, and the little hair he had clung to his cranium in patches going down in thin, black and oily strands. He had to have done this himself, I believe body integrity dysphoria is what it’s called. He was wearing a purple turtleneck with rips and slashes all over it, not to mention what looked like dried blood stains scattered all throughout it. 

I asked the man if he knew why I was talking to him barley being able to focus on my own words as his soulless eyes looked back into mine, he smiled revealing his toothless gums and let out a soft windy giggle, as I asked again his laugh grew louder and louder until I lost my composure and banged on the cold metal table, I’ve never let my emotions get the best of me but at this point I was shaking, I’ll never forget the words he spoke in that same soft and windy voice.
 

“Did you get my package?”
