AUDIO TRANSCRIPT

I’m going to kill myself. As soon as I finish recording this. I don’t want to, but what choice do I have? It’s the only way. At least the gun wasn’t empty. I can’t look at it, too risky, my eyes might eat it. They’re clever. I tried to cut them out but they stopped the knives, the bleach, the fire. Soon I’ll be blind. It’s the floaters, those tiny black dots. Always thought of them as friends. Watching over me, just out of sight. But now they won’t leave. More crowd in every day. Blotting things out, like ink in my eyes. I’m tired. I just want to sleep but they won’t stop *squirming*. I wish I could cry. I try and try but they eat all the tears. I’m scared, so, so, so scared. I don’t want to die, don’t want to have to do it. I just want my dad. Please, will you tell me where my dad is?

…

I–I’m sorry… Been getting, mixed up lately. Haven’t slept in days I think. Gotta breathe. Focus on this, no time for anything else. You all are almost ready outside. You have to know what happened here. Gotta save you. Gotta save the world.

…

I, um, I lived in a studio apartment. Top floor, on the north side of town. It had a view right out onto the building across the street. Perfect for watching people. The windows were small, easy to duck out of sight if I had to. But that other building was lined with huge panes of glass. I could see entire rooms through them, and plenty of people didn’t bother with their blinds. Every evening, those windows came to life. I’d make a pot of coffee, sit at my desk, and watch. Filling notebooks and flash drives with anything I could get my eyes on. Heights, weights, habits, routines. Their parents’ names. Their favorite movies. What they looked for in friends. What they liked to drink with breakfast. I could even get audio from some of their places. Most people are willing to download pretty much anything these days. Digging through their trash helps. Find old mail, full names, where they work, who they bank with. Make an email look professional and there’s no link the average person won’t click. Once I was in their computer, I was in their microphones and cameras and anything else they had lying around their network.

And, look, to you that might sound… kinda creepy. I get it. That’s what I’d think too. But I was not looking to take advantage, I swear. I am not a stalker. The rule was ‘look don’t touch.’ Because you can learn so much about a person by watching. Listening. Conversation isn’t the same. Isn’t as pure. We’re not ourselves around others. We become machines. Piles of gauges and dials. We tweak our words and our volume and our pitch until we hit that perfect frequency for whoever we’re interacting with. That’s all connection is. It’s unnatural. It’s disturbing. You think you know your loved ones so well? Wake up surrounded by confusion and screams and bullet holes in the walls. Do you really know what they’d do? What you would do? No. Because you only know the lies they feed you. Watch someone at home, in their bubble, where they think prying eyes couldn’t possibly get in. You’ll see truth. And even an ugly truth is sweeter than a lie.

…

Most of the time it’s easy, getting to know people. We’re just patterns. All the things we can’t not do. See that Jeremy binges and purges. See that he keeps his life organized at all costs. Listen in on Christmas with the family and learn his dad was military, that he moved around a lot growing up. In the apartment down the hall, see that Selena is married to a woman. Read an email from her sister and learn her dad is a hard-line conservative. See Selena send him a Christmas card every single year, then rush to check the mail for weeks.

You can connect the dots. Watch long enough, pick up enough details and behaviors and you build out their hearts, their souls in your mind. You witness them. As it should be. Life was good.

I tried to keep up with everyone I could see from my window, but I’m only human. It was easiest to focus in on one or two at a time. The day Emily moved in that was Travis and Ruth. Abuse was nothing new but their dynamic was fascinating. Travis was short but stocky, with a sharp nose and beady, rat’s eyes. He was sprawled on their couch with some old horror movie on his laptop. I was in its camera, watching him watch it. He kept rubbing his knuckles. A deep frown carved in his face.

Ruth, his wife, skulked around the edges of their apartment. Nursing a black eye and sweeping up the plates Travis had hurled at the wall before he hit her. She was playing out one of her murder fantasies, I could tell from the glances she shot at the back of his head. Eyes like jagged glass. That happened on days like this. I’d check her phone’s browser history and find her looking up ways to hide bodies, how to hurt people so they’d die slow, but quiet. Then she’d start shopping. Buying bleach, rope, tarps. Even a hacksaw once. She never followed through.

At the other end of the building, Selena and her wife Dawn had just gotten home. They liked to cap off their week by sharing an audiobook and a bottle of wine on the couch. That night it was book four of some fantasy epic. They were right at the end. Listening along always relaxed me. Made me feel warm to see the love there, and some of the stories were pretty good too. I was about to switch over to them when a noise came through Travis’ microphone. A door banging open, out in the hall. There was movement in the living room next to his. I grabbed my binoculars for a better look.

That was when I first saw her. Bundling into that vacant apartment, a big cardboard box taking up both arms. Her chin was planted on top so it wouldn’t tip forward. She isn’t–wasn’t, beautiful. Looked to be in her thirties. Chunky, but not quite fat. Her face was motherly. Round, and dimpled, and her dishwater hair had a habit of clumping into ropes. But the way she moved, floating around the apartment. Baggy white shirt billowing like angel’s wings as she unpacked a fuzzy blanket, a stack of heavy books, some plain sets of clothes. There was an awkward elegance in every movement she made. Like watching someone learn ballet.

A couple moving guys helped her carry up some furniture. There was a wooden bookshelf, a couch, and a big glass tank. It had a little pond inside, with a turtle resting on one of the rocks. She helped them out with all of it. Smiling and chatting. When they were done she gave them each some cash. “Thanks Emily, have a good one,” the last man said. I tasted the name. *Emily*. It fit her perfectly. I smiled. Said it again.

It’d been over a year since someone new had moved in, so I was excited. I had to know more. I waited. Tuning in to her window every night. Letting her get settled while I tried to figure her out. All the books made it clear she was well read. Intelligent. Her apartment was minimalist. Nothing on the walls, no unnecessary furniture. Her too-small mattress was shoved in a corner on the floor. She didn’t want to be tied down. Could pick up and leave at a moment’s notice. Did she move a lot for work? Was she running from something? Or did she just enjoy the freedom? The questions were fishhooks snagged in my brain. Tugging me back to her, always.

The only ‘extra’ she allowed herself was the turtle. She loved that thing. And it obviously felt the same. It could see the light in her. Its eyes followed her everywhere she went, like sunflowers. She kept its tank on a side table by the door so it was the first thing she saw when she got home. Every day she made sure the glass was spotless, that it had clean water and fresh greens to eat. The way it craned its head toward her finger when she stroked its shell was adorable. She had such a big heart, I still believe that.

But she worked long hours. Dawn till well past dusk, no days off. A week flew by and I barely learned anything new. As far as I could tell she had no friends. Didn’t have the time. She’d get home, take care of the turtle, eat some takeout and spend an hour or so staring at the TV. Then clean up and crash before heading out six hours later.

Her shoulders had a constant slump. I’d catch her crying late at night. Never for long. She’d clamp down before the whimpers grew to sobs. I thought she was lonely. Maybe she was. Doesn’t matter now. What matters is I was addicted. Starving. She was comfortable. The rest of the world fell away when I was with her. But I was stuck with a few hours a night, a morsel, when all I wanted was to shovel down plate after plate of her.

I’ll admit, maybe in the past I’ve gotten too interested in people. Never like that. It only got worse. When she left all the color in the world went with her. Everyone I used to love seemed dull. Petty. Nobody held my attention. The instant her lights turned on I’d drop everyone to attend to her. I hated it. Abandoning people I’d spent years with just to watch her eat, sleep, and feed that fucking turtle. Every day the guilt coiled tighter in my guts. But I kept doing it. Stopping would’ve been worse. Having her always just out of sight, never there but never gone. Who would do that to themselves?

…

That night, she wasn’t back by the usual time. I was starting to freak out. For all I knew she was in a dumpster with her throat cut. I kept grabbing my binoculars, eyes darting to her window. The turtle chewed a lettuce leaf. Not a care in the world. I envied it.

Then her door opened.

A woman's figure stood there, silhouetted by the light from the hall. A man slid into view behind her. His body was long and spindly. He shoved the woman stumbling into the apartment. His arm snaked in after her and flicked on the lights.

She was encased in some kind of protective gear. It was all black. Heavy duty boots, gloves, a jumpsuit with a hood that cinched. And a gas mask, fastened to her head with a web of thick straps. Someone had welded a metal plate across the top half like a blindfold. But there were two holes punched through. Shaky eyes stared out of them. Eyes I’d know anywhere.

The turtle stretched its head towards her as the man shut the door. He was in the same black suit as Emily, except he didn’t have a mask. He was older. Gaunt face etched with wrinkles. Short black hair with graying roots. His red-rimmed eyes watched Emily the way you’d watch a bear that hasn’t noticed you. As if any second its attention might turn. He inched closer to her back. Too close. My heart beat faster. Metal glinted in his fist. A pistol, its mouth pressed to her spine.

Emily started to whip around and face him but his free hand throttled the back of her neck, slammed her into the floor. Her head ricocheted off the hardwood. She groped at the sides of her mask as she writhed in pain. The turtle hid in its shell. The tall man ground his boot into her back, teeth bared, face screwed up tight. But tears slipped down his cheeks.

Reality snapped into focus around me. This was happening. I grabbed my camera. Pointed it at her window. Questions didn’t matter. All I had to do was watch. Everything I’d been waiting for, right in front of me. A chance to see the real Emily. If she got hurt, well, that’s life. Right? So why was my throat so tight?

Her front door bent inward as something rammed it from the other side. The tall man straightened. Jerked his eyes toward it, then right back to Emily. The end of his gun trembled. He heaved her to her feet. Wrapped his arm around her throat and made her a meat shield. Aimed his gun over her shoulder, at the door. The assault was warping it, cracking the wood. Neighboring apartments lit up as people jumped out of bed to investigate. Each *BANG* put another dent in their annoyed glares, until they crumbled into scared confusion.

Emily slammed her elbow back into the tall man’s gut. He sagged as the breath went out of him. His grip loosened and Emily dropped, rolled sideways. The door buckled at the waist and flew apart as a boot crashed through. A man made of muscle stood in the breach. Dressed in more black hazmat and a gas mask with a tinted visor. The tall man fell to one knee, dumped his magazine. Two shots caught the brute in the chest and shoved him back into the hall. Another three hammered his bicep, wrenched a submachine gun out of his hand.

Below, two black vans screeched to a stop at either end of the street. Headlights cut through the dark as the tall man fumbled to reload above them. A second gunman ducked in through the doorway, a long suppressor screwed to the end of his submachine gun. He pointed it at the tall man and shredded his head. Just like that, it was a wad of pulp.

The first pistol shots were what dragged the rest of the building out of bed. On the upper floors, closest to the action, people reacted fastest. Some hid in closets, under beds. Most ran to their doors. Cramming eyes into peepholes to see what was happening, if they could get away safe.

Emily crawled towards the tall counter that bordered her kitchenette. The brute’s gun coughed lead into her leg as she pulled herself behind cover. He sent another burst over the counter so she’d stay there.

Next door, Mona and her husband Mark were hiding under their dinner table. Side by side on their stomachs. Holding hands. I loved that table. It was beautiful, dark wood. They’d have huge dinners on it whenever Mona’s family came to town. All those people smiling together. The bullets from that second burst tore through their wall, into the tabletop and Mark he–he jiggled, as the back of his skull opened up. Mona raised her head. She had this shell-shocked look. Bloody spray in her gold hair. The gunman finished reloading. More metal whizzed past her and Mona’s face crumpled into a sob. She bolted out the door. Everyone who saw her threw their doors open, giving me scattered glimpses into the hall, and rushed to follow her to safety. Mona stopped at the elevator. Mashing the down button. The doors dinged open. Clogged with bodies as everyone pressed in. Further down, a bald man stepped out of one of the apartments across the hall, a rifle held white-knuckle tight. His face went slack when he saw the elevator. Back in their own apartment, Travis had Ruth by the hair. He hauled her to the door, kicking and screaming. Tossed her into the hall then stood back and waited. She landed on her shoulder, between the bald man and the elevator. His rifle flew toward the movement and sent a bullet through her eye. Turned the black bruise around it red. Travis slammed his door, backed away, kneading his palms into his forehead. The bald man stared at Ruth. Down at his gun. Back at her. Dumb shock on his face.

Panic poured down the building. Picking up more bodies on every floor until a wave of terrified people spilled onto the street. More came out of buildings nearby to point phones at the chaos. Muffled screams drifted up to my window. I’d seen people kill themselves before. Seen them cut, beaten, bruised. It’s not fun. Not a nice thing to watch. But even though they taste bitter, pain and fear are medicine. They cut the fat off the ego and leave us naked. Human. Everywhere I looked, through every window, people exposed their most essential selves. It should’ve been intimate. Breathtaking. Nothing in the world should’ve been able to pull me away.

Emily was hunkered behind the counter, her injured leg black with blood. She’d torn a strip of fabric off her sleeve and tied it above her knee. The gunman emptied another magazine over her head. She didn’t flinch. He had her pinned but wasn’t moving any closer. She stuck a spoon into the fabric and twisted. Using it to tourniquet her leg. It was amazing how capable she was.

Between bursts the gunman would put a finger to his ear. Maybe calling for backup from the vans down the street. Their doors stayed shut. Nobody was coming. Why hadn’t he walked up and shot her? She was hurt, didn’t have a weapon. But it wouldn’t be long now. He’d get brave. She had nowhere to run.

That’s when my body stood. So fast it knocked the camera over. My legs crossed the room and my hands opened the door. My mind was in an uproar as I took the stairs three at a time. Too many thoughts brawling in the muck.

She was about to die, one of them kept shouting.

That’s life, another chimed in. Nobody lasts forever. There would always be more people to watch. But my legs wouldn’t listen to reason. My heart was a freight train in my chest.

I’m pretty sure I was scared.

Then why couldn’t I turn around? I had no idea who those people were, what was happening, I barely even knew Emily. And I’d seen people call the cops. They were on their way. 

Not fast enough. She needed help. Needed me. I was the only one who could’ve saved her.

Why did I care? It was wrong, inflicting myself on her like that. That was where her choices had led. Her choices, not mine. I had no right to take them away.

But I kept seeing her. In flashes. Petting her turtle, stacking her books. Grappling with tears in the dark. Always alone. My eyes burned. When she died it’d be my fault. That thought looped through my head, over and over, louder and louder.

All I had to do was stay away. I’d done it for over a decade. So why her?

It just–it wasn’t fair. She deserved better, she was a good person. Kind, and sad, and dedicated. Why did someone like that have to die?

I wanted her to live. More than anything.

The fact I’d have to shoot someone was the least of my concerns. Death was death, seeing it up close wouldn’t change that. And it wasn’t like I’d never had the urge. All the men Mom used to cycle through the house. The dad’s for a night. I could do it. For her I could do it. Any doubts melted away as I hit the ground floor. I saw oh so clearly. I didn’t care that I could die. Because I was too smart for that, right? I saw the bigger picture. I knew exactly where the danger would be. What harm can a bullet do if the gun isn’t pointed at you? So clever. So courageous.

It was dark outside. Like the sky had bled out. The black vans stoppering the ends of the street were gone. I wondered why, but only for a second. She made me fearless. Made me blind.

There were people everywhere. Casting warped, funhouse shadows under the streetlights. Random shouts of “go!” and “fuck!” and “help!” echoed as they ran, or froze with glazed eyes, or looked for loved ones in the mess. Selena was there. Her face drawn, and pale. She had Dawn’s arm slung over her shoulder, was helping her hobble out of the building.

I crossed the street. Throwing nervous glances around me. A mousy woman held the big glass door as she ushered people through. I pushed by and she grabbed at my sleeve, yelled “wait!” I shook free into the foyer. Eyes down. No distractions.

Dark stains covered the floor by the elevator. Bloody footprints. Sneakers and sandals and bare feet. I took a while to press the button. A sound came from inside as the metal doors crawled open. *Drip, drip, drip*. A shape was slumped against the back wall. I stepped in, not thinking, wanting a better look. Wasn’t until the doors shut behind me that I realized it was Mona. The air vent in the ceiling made her gold hair flutter.

She’d fallen. Or been pushed. Cracked her forehead on the edge of the metal handrail so hard it split her open and lodged there. She hung off it, like a wet towel. Then all those scared people had crushed in on top of her. Pounded her spine into the hard angle where the floor met the wall. Footprints tracked the backs of her sweatpants. The fingers on one hand were bent and twitching, like a squashed spider’s legs. Blood fell from somewhere I couldn’t see. Probably the ditch in her forehead. But I heard it. *Drip, drip, drip*.

I stood with my nose pressed against the door as the elevator rose. I’d seen worse than this, I told myself. One dead body wouldn’t break me. I thought about peeling her off the wall, letting her rest with some dignity. But that bend in her spine… It hurt to look at. That hand made my guts crawl. Why subject myself to it? Not like this was my fault.

The doors dinged open. I shoved the thoughts away and got out. Another clatter of gunfire down the hall. Smothered by the suppressor. My feet kept moving.

“Command this is Trapper Two, requesting support!” The gunman’s voice was hoarse, full of gravel. “I say again, asset containment breached. Host is cornered but I cannot advance. Deploy the cage right *fucking* now!”

But nobody answered. His friends were long gone. The one who’d broken down the door was dead in the hall. On his stomach. A dark streak trailed behind him. I crept over, every muscle tensed, and put my hand on his gun.

A high, winding scream serrated the silence. I leapt back, tried to point the gun at the man on the floor and it danced between my hands before I got a grip. He stayed corpse-still. The scream kept going. Distending. Nothing but pain. The kind an animal makes when they aren’t killed clean. It didn’t last long. A handful of seconds. Then this gruesome, ripping. The scream fell apart into a wet gurgle. Cold fear stabbed my chest. Was I too late? I stumbled into Emily’s ruined doorway, and froze.

The second gunman was floating in midair. Beyond mutilated. His mask was gone. His arms were flung out to either side. He still had his gun in one hand and he was fighting to move it but it was pinned there. Like he’d been crucified. Every bit of flesh had been scraped clean off his other arm. The bones gleamed as it hung there. Skeletal. And there was this noise, this gnashing, metal-chewing whine that raked through my ears as, under that arm, something started to grind the skin on the side of his chest into wet froth, like it was polishing away rust. Bright white ribs smiled through the opening. His head lolled. Crazy eyes bulging. Foam flecked mouth working open and closed but all he spoke was a river of blood. It was everywhere. Gushing out of every orifice. Wrung out of a human sponge. And still the floor below him was clean. A clump of insides slopped out over his naked hip and just, melted into thin air.

Emily stood opposite him. Propping herself up on the counter, the two black holes in her mask drilling into him.

A metallic click hung in the air. There was a spray of plaster dust as a bullet hole opened in one of the walls. Smoke swirled from the end of my gun. It was raised. My finger relaxed and I realized, I’d pulled the trigger. I don’t know why. It just, happened.

Emily’s gaze flicked over to me. My skin went hot, started to itch. The force that kept the gunman floating let go. He managed to swing his good arm as he fell. The gun went off. Drew a line across Emily’s head. Her legs turned to jelly and she crumpled as the gunman slapped onto the floor.

Quiet then. Nothing moved. Vomit was pushing up my throat, when I heard the noise. Coming from behind the counter. From Emily.

It’s amazing how the brain is able to build its own private reality. Scrub the insanity away for now, it says, and focus on what must be true. In that instant there had never been a floating man. And I truly believed I heard Emily breathing. Even when I saw her on her back, motionless, leg weeping blood, I couldn’t quite believe it. Not until I saw the fresh hole through her throat.

I’ve had a lot of time to think about that moment. Imagine orgasming with your eyes closed. Then opening them and finding yourself fucking a pig. Regret, confusion, shame, they cling to you like stale sweat. Squeezing you, so you can’t get a full breath. You want to scrub them away but they’ve soaked into your skin. And something’s wrong inside you. The world’s shifted somehow, and it’s your fault. You want to curl into a ball and disappear, make it so you never existed. But you can’t. So you just, keep going.

The noise was getting louder. Angrier. A spitting hiss, like oil boiling. Coming from behind Emily’s mask. The whole thing started to shudder. Struggling against the mess of straps holding it to her face. Black flecks dotted the metal plate welded across her eyes and, inside the two holes punched through it, something was moving.

I should have left then. But I had to see. So I just, kept going. I crouched over her, took her head in my hands, and looked into her eyes. Part of me still held onto the tiniest hope that she’d look back, teary with relief.

But her eyes were gone. Two black pits full of tarry, bubbling liquid stared back instead. Droplets of it spat out onto the metal, the mask, the floor around her head.

Then the pits went still. I felt something watching, just out of sight. Something massive. It laid its eyes on me. Eyes all around me, peeling me back, layer by later. I tried to turn away but it was too late. The liquid came alive. It leapt out of her head and splashed onto my face, cold and slimy. I jerked back. Fell. My back hit the ground and I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see. The world was black. I clawed at my face. Trying to get it off, get it out, but it moved. Probing. Slipping through the gaps by my tear ducts. Pouring itself into the space around my eyeballs and hugging them tight. I felt myself scream as I writhed on the floor. A weird, disembodied howl that never seemed to end.

And then, I could see again. The scream sputtered out. Black floaters hung in my vision. I blinked them away. The backs of my eyes itched. Everything was too bright. I got to my feet. Trying to rein my breath in. God I was hungry. Starving. It filled my brain to the brim.

Sirens wailed outside. Lights washed in. Painting the room red and blue. Something tugged at my head. Reeling me towards the window. Three cop cars made a line on the street. Officers were trying to herd the dregs of the crowd behind it. Selena was there, an old shirt pressed to a gash in Dawn’s forehead. Travis’ had made it. His eyes bounced between the officers as his tongue flickered across his lips. Rob held his little son Nathan to his burly chest. Jeremy’s red hair bobbed as he paced. There were so many more. Everywhere I looked was a face I’d spent time with.

The itch in my eyes was like fire. I ground my fists into them but that made it worse. When I pulled my hands away, the edges of my vision were fuzzy and dark. A black dot drifted out into view. A floater, smaller than a gnat. It was moving towards one of the cops. I tried to blink it away but more shook loose. Then more, and more. The first landed on the cop’s shoulder. A big, bearded man with tattooed forearms. He winced and slapped at it. There was nothing there. He looked around, confused. He couldn’t see it. It’d never left my eyes. Another one went over his cheek and he hissed, slapped there too. But it was like trying to swat away a sniper. His buddies were giving him weird looks. Floaters kept pouring out of the corners of my eyes. A great buzzing swarm. They fell over the cop’s hand first. Packed so close they made a quivering silhouette, like a glove of flies. He yelped. Tried to yank his arm away but it was cemented in place. His friends started shouting. Tracing their pistols across roofs and windows. Tension rolled through the people behind them. Nobody understood what was happening. The cop opened his mouth to scream and the swarm darted into it. Blackened his jaw. He pawed at it and they spilled up his fingertips as they hoisted him into the air. Now his friends’ guns were pointed at him. Every mouth hung open. The crowd were on their feet. But nobody moved. They all watched in spellbound silence as a man was eaten by the air.

More floaters congealed around the cop’s body. Lunging at any hint of movement. And where they went he came apart like soggy bread. Deflating. No more room on his bones so they descended on the crowd. So many I could barely see through them all. People started swatting at themselves. Slapping their arms and legs in a strange dance that kept picking up tempo. Then they started to scream. One of the cop’s friends put a bullet in his floating skeleton.

I slammed my eyes shut. I didn’t want to see. I thought it would stop them. They didn’t like that. Itching burning excruciating pain all over my eyes. The nerves hooked into them became molten chains, rattling back into my skull, down my neck.

I shrieked. Short and sharp like shattering glass. My eyes flew open and the pain was gone. The floaters were black flames flickering over a field of bodies. The people were made of wax. They melted, flailing and sobbing, into puddles of bone and torn clothing. Mangled screams piled on top of each other, like bodies in a pit, until they were one awful noise. Officers shot at the air. Bullets ate into the street, smashed through windows. One tore past Dawn’s face as her skin peeled away into muscle, into skull. Selena kept trying to scoop her back together. Another stray bullet pinged off a lamppost, blew chunks out the back of Selena’s head and they both toppled at Travis’ feet. His squeals died as a black splotch gripped his jaw and squeezed. It climbed further up his face and left wreckage behind. He was crying when they swept over his eyes.

One by one, the screams winked out. Like all the stars dying. Then a silence that ate the world. My eyes cleared as the swarms broke apart. They swam back into the dark corners of my head, swollen and lazy. The street was a carpet of death. All the people I’d dedicated my life to. Blended together on the asphalt. I couldn’t tell who was who. If I’d never been born, it wouldn’t have happened. I snapped my head away. My stomach was swollen. The backs of my eyes purred.

A long moan limped out of me. My knees hit the floor but the pain, and everything else, was far away. Blurry around the edges. Reality was watercolor. I couldn’t hear over the blood hammering my temples. The ragged breaths sawing through me. I cried fat, silent tears that never made it out of my eyes. Those things sucked them down as soon as they welled up.

Panic set in. Bone deep. I tried to claw at my eyes but every time my shaky hands got close that rabid pain woke back up so I tore at my hair instead.

I wanted my dad. Wanted his arms around me. The smell of beef on his work clothes as he hugged me and told me it would be okay. But he was dead. I used to see it, when I could still sleep. The garage door gaping open. His brains pink on the car’s black dashboard. Mom never let me read the note.

He hadn’t acted any different before. He’d always been sad. I should’ve watched him closer, I would’ve seen it. He knew what mom was doing. I could tell from the way his lips pressed white when I told him. He’d been able to live with it. But I had to confront him. Had to rub his face in it. Like he was a dog. He couldn’t even look at me. I only wanted him to be happy. To take me away. He was gone when I woke up.

My whimpers morphed into hacking, breathless laughter. I threw up. Nothing but bile. Floaters ate that too. I wiped slime off my lips and they picked it off the back of my hand. That crowd of tangled screams echoed through me. I sprang to my feet. Dug around the kitchen drawers till I found duct tape and ran it in strips over the windows. Until no light could seep in. Then I crawled under Emily’s sheets and hid.

Keeping track of the rest was hard. The brain can only take so much. It’s a coward at heart.

There were more sirens. People gathering outside. Waiting to starve me out, or getting ready to storm the building. What would happen when they did was the only thing on my mind. Well, not the only thing. Wasn’t long until I got hungry again. And then all I could think about was Mona, in the elevator with her eggshell skull, dripping sweet red juices. The wad of brains clinging to the tall man’s neck. Getting stiff. Starting to stink. Might help clear the air if I looked at them. Just the ones in the room. I was so, so, hungry. Could barely breathe through the drool. The thought of normal food made me sick, and my eyes were getting angry. Stinging like wasps. I started with the gunman, the half-eaten one. Just to tide me over. I stared at him till his bones shone white. After that, I sat back. The turtle was at the edge of its tank. Looking back and forth across the room. It had such sad eyes. It must’ve been thirsty, so I went and filled a dish with water. When I put it in the tank there was a little squeak. Floaters pranced over tiny bones and broken bits of shell. It happened so fast. They snatched it out of the corner of my eye.

I tried to cry again. But it’s not the same without tears. Muscle memory tried to blink after but my lids were stuck in place. I realized, I hadn’t blinked in hours. It’s a weird feeling, having your eyes pried open, but it doesn’t hurt. They keep them wet. Pick away all the debris. I miss it though. Blinking. Crying. Human things. I went straight to the kitchen knives and stabbed one at my eye. The point was about to drive home when they chewed through the metal and it disappeared down to the handle, like a retractable prop. I kept going until handles were heaped on the counter. Next thing I knew I was under the covers again. Trying to ignore the constant squirming behind my eyes. It hit me then that, in the right hands they could’ve eaten cancer, eaten disease. Emily dedicated her life to making the world a better place and I killed her. I killed everyone. The next day I ate the tall man. Better that than let him rot. At least he was dead already. At least it stopped the pain in my head. It’s what he would have wanted. I found some bleach in Mark’s apartment, tried to pour it in my eyes but all it did was burn my face. I tried everything. And still, one by one, the bodies turned to spotless bones. Until it was just Emily and I.

A small army outside by then. Hundreds maybe. I heard them marching. Voices barking orders, trucks rolling in. I was getting hungry again. They got more impatient with every meal. I couldn’t eat Emily. She deserved rest. Maybe I could peel open the window an inch. Just a taste couldn’t hurt. An arm or a leg. The thought made me sick but there was nothing in my stomach so I retched in the corner like a cat. The world was worse with me in it. But they’d find someone else to jump into if I died. I had to fix it. I made myself think about Emily. She’d want to help them. To save them from me. Took some effort to actually get my eyes on her. But the hunger won out in the end. My hands shook as I undid the straps of her mask.

Her skin was mottled, the color of rotten grapes. It seemed a size too big. Those deep, deep pits where her eyes had been were fixed on me. Her face was different somehow. A smile slashed across it, I’d never seen her smile like that. The corners of her mouth twisted up into cruel points. Like she was laughing at me. Like I was the punchline to a sick joke.

I fell back. My hand hit the tall man’s pistol and sent it skittering sideways under a lamp. Light bounced off the black metal and the gun gleamed like smiling teeth. The whole world was laughing. I went cold, and heavy. My blood was lead. I was tired. Tired to the bone. The noise outside was getting louder. My hand scrabbled at the floor till it closed around the pistol. I made sure not to look.

…

You’re inside now. I hear boots down the hall. You’ll be here soon.

Whatever you do, don’t let me see you. They’ll still be in me after I’m gone. But I’ll put up a barricade, and slide this under the door. Hope that whoever finds it listens.

Please listen. Please.

And maybe, if everything ends up alright, you could try to remember me.
