As a child growing up I loved Curious George, that silly monkey always getting into trouble, and always having fun, silly little adventures, as a child I absolutely adored it, I always loved the boat race and the one where the man in the yellow hat was sick and George dremot he went inside him and fought off the sickness, I'd seen every episode of season 1, season 2, and season 3 at the time because we had them all on DVD's. 

My parents hated how much I watched it simply because I was constantly watching it over, and over, and over again. Looking back I really can't blame them, however now as an adult I moved out, I'm 19 and finally got my own apartment, I moved most of my stuff out of my parents house already, however last week I was picking up the last of it and we were in the attic grabbing some boxes when I find a box labeled DVD Videos' and obviously I opened it. It contained.. Well… DVD videos obviously, but I found my old Curious George seasons 1-3 and asked my parents if I could take them as well, they didn't care they'd forgotten they were even up here honestly. 

So yesterday once I finally had some time off from work I popped one in my DVD player and began watching. The first one was of course season one episode one with the kite and the cat scratches, because every episode consisted of two mini episodes, and so on, until I got to episode 4, which had Buoy Wonder, and then Roller Monkey, if you haven't seen those episodes, I won't be talking about them, go watch them I guess, but then as I'm about to get up while the next episode should start playing, a new episode labeled "Stranded" which I thought nothing of at first because I didn't know the names of each episode, however as I started watching and got a little through, I noticed I'd never seen it before, I looked at the box and it didn't show any episode by this name, but I just figured it was a misprint and that maybe I had just forgotten it.

George and the man were on a boat and basically they ended up stranded on an island. It was a bit grainy looking, not nearly as clear as the others but apart from that it had seemed normal. Though it did have more darker colors and more… Dark themes… It was a pretty small island with no animals and they were clearly starving… Literally, after a few days of no food or water. It was certainly a bit dark for a children's show, but it was still friendly and seemed fine, however I must admit it had certainly caught my curiosity. During being stranded they made two make shift tents, the man in the yellow hat had a pocket knife and they tried to keep their hopes up. They made fires to stay warm and an SOS sign out of rocks.. 

The man tells stories as George does his usual charades for his way of communicating and they laugh, they reminisce about their home and what they'll do when they're picked up. At about ¾'s of the way through they start to go… A bit… Crazy… From their hunger. As they seem to continue growing hungrier and hungrier, and as they go to bed… The camera zooms out from a sleeping George… 

The man in the once yellow hat, now a dirty, muddied, torn up hat, his clothes the same way, holding a knife, we see him, his face contorted, he speaks softly and quietly to the sleeping monkey, and we see him take his arm up… And then come down, the knife still in hand. The camera cuts to black as we hear a flesh tearing (or… Ripping? Cutting?) noise and as the camera comes back its day time, the man comes out of his tent, his clothes stained red now, his face… Red… We see the other tent George was sleeping in, red stains everywhere, a path of red like something dead was drug on the sand into the forest, we see the man talking to himself, seemingly no remorse or even thought of what happened the night before. The episode continues with him making a fire and a plane seeing it and him being saved…. However… We never see George again in that episode. 

When I finished that episode I couldn't help but be… Horrified. It was a horrifying thing to see and the entire thing of DVD's has been burned. I don't know where that episode came from, or what its deal was, but I cant get that scene of the man, the man we'd seen smile so many times… Covered in red, the look on his face when standing over George, the look only describable as… Maniacal. Maniacal and desperate. After that I have difficulties sleeping, who wouldn't after all… As dumb as it sounds… I always feel like he'll be there… Like the man is standing over me… With that same… Maniacal look on his face.
