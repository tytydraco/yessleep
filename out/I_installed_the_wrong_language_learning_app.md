Like most people, I was unsatisfied with how few languages I knew. Actually, the plural in “languages” there was just for show, I’d only known one language my entire life and that was English. I wasn’t even particularly good at English, just passable. But things changed when my group of friends decided that we should each encourage each other to do something new and exciting, so I chose to learn a new language – German. I had picked out a couple apps and tried. There was Deutschwelle, Babel and of course, Duolingo. Each had their pros and cons, but none grew on me and so I gave up on all of them. The furthest I went was a one-month streak with Duolingo, and that was with using some streak-keeping functions on the app.

I aired my grievance to my group of friends one Friday evening. Josh thought it was because I wasn’t dedicated enough and needed a system of informing my friends about my progress. Nathan, on the other hand, thought that maybe I tried too many things too quickly and just lost steam. Nguyen was the one who recommended a better learning app.

Deutschdevil looked just like any other language app, save for the fact that the mascot and also the icon for the app was the face of a demon – two red horns, long tongue and red eyes with white irises. It had the initials D E on his forehead. I didn’t even remember how I installed it. I remembered having to run through hoops and Nguyen having to sit with me for nearly the rest of that evening.

“Man, this is really a hassle,” I told him when I had to visit a weird website to install the app.

“I know, but it was really effective for me. It even threatens you when you break your streak. So German. Try it. I guarantee you’ll love it.”

I let out a sigh and finished jumping through all the necessary steps. On the registration screen, the app didn’t even ask for my name. It just gave me one of the terms and condition screen. I scrolled past it as usual and it prompted me to re-read.

“You can’t terminate this contract once it’s signed. Read carefully” the screen said. I scrolled past it again. It was the fourth app I installed. I knew the drill. As soon as I hit accept, pain instantly shot up my index finger and I dropped my phone. I looked at my finger and there was a drop of blood on it.

“What the..”

“It did that to me too. Exciting huh?” Nguyen said.

“Uh, apps can’t prick your finger, dude. It’s a coincidence that it happened to you too,” I told him. He gave me this self-assured just-believe-me-dude look. I picked up my phone and put it in my pocket, planning to start my lesson that evening.

When I got home, I fed my dog Red, showered, and then took out my phone. Deutschdevil showed a notification, asking me to select how many minutes I would spend learning in a day. There were two options. 666 and 13. I thought that was very thematic. I preferred even numbers, so I picked 666 and it led me to a screen that explained the rules. I would need to learn 6 new words every day, 6 days a week for 6 months. I thought that was simple enough. The app asked me if I was sure. I agreed and it took me to the first lesson. The layout was very similar to Duolingo and I immediately got to learning.

I made very quick progress. My previous grammar knowledge from other apps helped. After 30 minutes of German, I got tired and just turned off my phone and slept.

That Saturday I had a blind date. I spent practically the entire day preparing for the date, working out, picking the right outfit and watching my favorite influencers talking about how to score on a date. I forgot about Deutschdevil.

That evening, I was having a lot of fun with my date Samantha. She was sweet, funny and gorgeous and seemed really into me. I thought to myself there was no way I would fumble this. In the middle of our conversation, my phone dinged and showed a notification. It was Deutschdevil, reminding me that I needed to complete my streak. I ignored the app and continued with my evening.

The evening grew steamy. Samantha was in the bathroom freshening up and I was sitting on the bed. My phone rang again, Deutschdevil sent out another warning about keeping my streak. I ignored it once again. I was about to finally get laid after months and I wasn’t about to learn German before it. We did what couples did when they are naked together and we fell asleep soon after.

My phone sent out another notification. This time though, the background of my phone turned red. Thinking it was some sort of error, I sat up and looked at it. The background wasn’t just red, it showed arms jutting out from the earth with rend flesh and exposed, bloody bones. I clicked on the notification and it took me to the Deutschdevil app. Before I could do anything, a text in black background and crimson letters told me that I broke my streak and the punishment would be one cut on my hand. It also warned me that the next time I broke my streak, one of my bones would break. I had to admit, reading that really made my heart jump. But I didn’t think much of it, it was probably just a psychological trick made by the developers to make sure that I stayed on the app and learned. I scoffed, put down the phone and went back to bed. Mere seconds later, I felt a sharp pain on my right hand. I looked at it, there was a deep cut, as if a knife had sliced my hand. Blood poured out and Samantha had to bandage me. I thought that I must have hit my hand on something and soon fell asleep.

The following days passed by in a blur. I would get up, go to work, go home, learn some German on Deutschdevil and fall asleep. It was business as usual until Friday. On that day I went to a party with my group of friends. Josh was learning to be a mixologist, so naturally I tried out many of his drinks and got so drunk I couldn’t feel my hand. I only remembered drinking way too much before passing out on the couch.

I woke in the middle of the night from a dull, throbbing pain. I took my right hand to wipe my eyes and the moment I tried to move my left arm, pain shot up like thousands of needles poking me in the arm. I looked at my left arm and it was bent at a weird angle. I immediately groaned and woke up my friends.

Josh woke up first. He mixed the drinks and so didn’t drink much. He saw my arms and immediately rushed to find a splint. We settled on a piece of cut out cardboard. Nathan drove me to the hospital and Josh got in the car as well.

“What the hell did you do? How did you even break your arm like that?” Josh asked.

“I don’t know man. Last thing I remembered was having a White Russian that you made and passing out on the couch,”

“Maybe someone laid or stepped on it while you were asleep. People get drunk at a party and often bump into stuff” Nathan added.

“Yeah, but so hard it breaks his bone? Just doesn’t make sense man.” Josh said.

The hospital visit was uneventful. The doctor smelled alcohol on my breath and assumed I had a fight with someone and was too embarrassed to tell him why. We did an X-ray scan and then he cleaned my arms before putting it in a cast. By the time I got home again, it was afternoon.

I took out my phone and once again saw the red background with arms jutting out. It was Deutschdevil. Suddenly something inside me clicked and I recalled the app’s warning. I clicked on the notification and it took me to Deutschdevil’s screen. It told me that I broke my streak and the punishment was one broken bone and warned me that the next time, the one whom I held close would die. I was freaked out at reading this. A cut on the hand was one thing but a broken bone? Something was definitely up with this app. I tried to delete it but the delete button didn’t show up. The only options were to select either 666 or 13. Alarmed, I texted Nguyen to ask him about this app. He didn’t reply. I called him and still no answer. Defeated, I opened Deutschdevil and learned German.

I asked my boss to take the next week off due to health issues and he agreed. You could make plenty of excuses with a broken arm. Samantha came by and took care of me in the evening. Alone at home, I caught up with learning German using Deutschdevil. I was getting better, or so I thought. When Samantha told me she spent 6 months in Germany, I was surprised. We tried having a conversation in German and my “die”, “der” and “das” articles were all over the place. I gave up after 5 minutes. Obviously, she was much better than I was. I started regretting even installing Deutschdevil.

The week went by quickly and soon Friday evening came again. I was watching a movie with Samantha when I received a call from Josh.

“Nguyen is dead”

“What?” I asked him before realizing that I completely forgot about the text message I sent to Nguyen.

“He just died this evening. They guessed that it was a brain aneurysm. He just dropped dead. The funeral’s on Sunday”

The news hit me like a truck. Nguyen was one of the healthiest among my friend group. He ate vegan, attended frequent marathons and was fit and strong. His passing was so sudden I was shocked more than sad.

It was a rainy Sunday during Nguyen’s funeral. His mom bawled her eyes out when his coffin was lowered into the ground. When she saw me, she muttered something under her breath but I couldn’t hear it before she cried again. The wind and rain sheets only accentuated the drab grey of the cemetery.

After the funeral was over, Nguyen’s mom walked over to where we were standing. I was chatting with Nathan and Josh about how Nguyen’s death didn’t make sense. It was our own way of making sense of what happened and process grief.

“Thank you for coming to his funeral. He would have wanted you all to be here.”

“It’s no problem, ma’am. We want to be here, for him,” I told her.

“I know it’s not right to ask, but did you notice anything strange before his passing?” Josh asked.

“Don’t ask that question. She’s still grieving. Brain aneurysm is always unpredictable” Nathan said.

“I just… it just didn’t make sense to me” Josh said.

“It’s okay. There wasn’t anything strange with Nguyen up until the very end. After his phone broke, he just kept muttering something about keeping the streak or something. He would get obsessed. I heard him at 3 A.M in the morning cursing himself. He mentioned you too, saying that he had put you both in danger” she told me.

“His phone broke? How many days ago was that?” I asked her.

“I couldn’t remember clearly. Maybe 3 or 4 days. I wanted to ask you something, did he talk to you about his symptoms or something? Why did he mention you? Do you two have the same condition?” Nguyen’s mom asked me. Deutschdevil immediately came to my mind, but I couldn’t tell her that an app probably killed her son. I ended up just telling her that I didn’t know either and he was probably just hallucinating. She looked like she didn’t believe me for a second but went away eventually.

I went home and Red greeted me at the door. I petted him on the head and felt somewhat lighter. I sat down immediately tried to find ways to delete the app. Once again there was no delete button when I held on it. So I tried to factory reset my phone. The screen went black and a progress bar showed up. When it was done restarting, I looked around and to my horror, Deutschdevil was the only non-essential app on my phone. The devilish face was still there, as if mocking me. I clicked on the app and searched around for the developer’s information but there wasn’t any. I plugged my phone to my laptop and did some digging for meta information on the app. There was no developer, no publisher, no official website, nothing. I retraced the websites that Nguyen sent me and found an unofficial forum for past users of the app. It took me to a website with the same demon theme with a dark background and crimson letters.

I scrolled through and read a few threads. There were only a handful of users. The top post was about someone completing 6 months of Deutschdevil. He said he “survived the gauntlet”. The comments were people cheering him up. The next post was about someone looking for the information of the developer. One of the users left a cryptid comment: “The dev is the beloved fallen son, you need look no further.”

I closed the laptop and rubbed my eyes. I was in way over my head with this app. But I guessed that I could manage 6 new words a day for 6 months.

The following week passed by quickly. I made learning German one of the first thing to do after I got out of bed so that I wouldn’t forget it. I was getting slightly better at German day after day, but still couldn’t hold a full conversation in German with my girlfriend.

Friday came and Samantha dropped by my house again. We talked, watched a movie, ate dinner and slept together. She was having an episode of insomnia and wanted to talk through the night. I was dead tired and so fell asleep.

“Hey, my phone’s battery is dead. Can I use yours?” she asked before I closed my eyes.

“Sure, go ahead,” I answered before falling asleep.

That morning, I woke up and learned 6 new words like always. Samantha made me breakfast before leaving for her own home. I spent the entire day watching movies and took Red out for a jog in the afternoon. The cold air jolted my lungs awake. Samantha told me that she would be back that evening to make dinner together.

Me and Samantha watched a Thai horror movie while finishing our dinner. Red whimpered at the scene which revealed that the ghost was sitting on top of the main character the whole time. After cleaning up, we got to bed and fell asleep.

I woke up that night to ringing. I opened my eyes and looked at my watch. It was 3 A.M. I looked at my phone. Once again, the familiar crimson background with decaying arms was there.

“No no no” I screamed and woke up Samantha.

“What’s going on? Why aren’t you in bed?” she asked.

“My phone…I lost my streak again. That’s impossible!”

“What? You’re not making a lot of sense. What are you talking about?”

“The German learning app. I broke my streak” I told her, my voice shaking and cracking up.

“Oh that? Sorry. Yesterday I looked around your phone and saw only that app so I played around with it. Pretty cool language app, a little bloody and demon-themed for me.”

“Yes, but that wasn’t supposed to happen. I already learned 6 words this morning.”

“Oh that? I played around with it yesterday and found a setting which said 13 so I clicked on it.”

“You did what?” I couldn’t believe in my ears.

“Yeah, I thought since you wanted to improve your German so bad, 13 words a day will do you good. It’s not that hard”

She didn’t understand the consequences. I immediately clicked on the phone and it took me to a warning screen. It told me that I broke my streak and the one I held dear would be dead. It also warned me about the next time I break my streak. It then showed a countdown to 10. I looked at Samantha and hugged her tightly.

“I’m sorry. I’m so fucking sorry Samantha. I love you a lot and it’s killing you”

“You’re scaring me,” she told me with a shaky voice.

I didn’t say anything. I hugged her and looked at my phone. The countdown slowly reached zero. When it did, I felt Samantha’s body went limp.

“I’m sorry Samantha. I love you” I told her.

“Yes, I love you too, but..” she answered. My head felt like it was torn open and light was streaming in. She was still alive. I nearly cried from being so happy.

“I think something’s wrong with your dog” she told me.

I looked behind me and my dog Red was taking staggered steps. He walked around for a while before collapsing on the floor. I rushed towards him. He was looking at me with those beady eyes and moments later, his chest stopped heaving and he was gone. That was when I realized how much I loved my dog. He was with me through thick and thin, always cheering me on. Every time I got home, he would be there, wagging his tails and licking my arms. The memories with him came flooding back and I realized that I was never going to feel that again. Tears streamed from my eyes and I couldn’t control them. Samantha sat next to me and she put a hand on my shoulder, but the pain only magnified.

I held a small funeral for my dog. I took his remains to be cremated and scattered his ashes on a hill nearby. Samantha couldn’t understand why I did what I did. She told me that I should delete the scary app.

On the way home, I bumped into a homeless guy. In my anger I scolded the man harshly. He gave me a weird stare before rushing away.

When I got back home, I reached inside my pocket. Only, my phone wasn’t there. I felt my face hot and blood drained from my arms. I searched around like a mad man, asked Samantha to call my phone number but couldn’t find it anywhere. Then I remembered the homeless man.

So I’m writing this to tell you what happened to me. If you are that homeless guy, please return my phone. I will give you any amount of money. Just please don’t let my streak die.
