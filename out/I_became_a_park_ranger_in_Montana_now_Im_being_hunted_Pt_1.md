It was my first day in the field as a park ranger. My first duty station was in one of the most remote regions in the state. The sky over Montana hung heavy with storm clouds casting darkness over the endless trees. The mountains lined the horizon, their peaks disappearing into the sky. I had never seen mountains so big, jagged, and imposing. I was eager to make a good impression, eager to prove I belonged here. This job had always been my dream. But, as I drove up the narrow dirt road to the ranger station, a knot of unease began to creep into my stomach.

The isolation of this place was palpable, even from my car. The silence of the wilderness pressed in on me, broken only by the wind against the tree branches or the distant cry of an animal. Civilization was far away, and for the first time since taking this job, I realized how truly alone I was going to be. But, despite this, I felt confident, and excited to put my new training to use.

The ranger station came into view, smoke from the chimney rising into the air. It was nestled at the edge of Pine Creek Forest. The station was small, squat, and unassuming, honestly more of a cabin than a headquarters. Standing by the entrance was Earl Bennett. A burly man in his mid-fifties with graying hair poking out from under his hat, and a weather-beaten face that had clearly seen its share of harsh winters. He didn’t smile when he saw me approaching, and he skipped the pleasantries.

"You're late," he grunted, glancing at his watch.

I swallowed hard, feeling my confidence suddenly turn into nervousness. "Sorry, sir. The roads.."

"The roads are always like that, it’s middle-of-nowhere Montana, kid" he cut me off. "You’ll learn soon enough. Out here, you better be prepared for anything."

I nodded, feeling small under his stern gaze, like a child getting a good lecture from his parents. “Well, come on then”, he said as he motioned for me to follow him into the station. As I entered, I spotted another ranger sitting quietly in the corner, staring out the window at the coming storm. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man with long black hair tied back in a ponytail, and a calm expression on his face. Earl didn't introduce him immediately.

The station was simple; a few desks, a gun safe, a kitchen, a radio room, and sleeping quarters in the back. Earl handed me a map of the region. "Your job is to patrol this area. You’re going to check for signs of poaching, illegal campsites, and anything else that doesn't belong. Poaching’s been a problem around here for a while. Keep your eyes open, learn your area, and don’t ever let yourself get too comfortable."

I nodded, unfolding the map and scanning the area. My territory stretched deep into the dense forests, far beyond where most people would dare to venture. "And him?" I asked, motioning toward the man by the window.

Earl glanced over. "That's Daniel Black Elk. He’s the quiet type, but he knows these woods better than anyone. If he gives you guidance, you better listen up. His family's been on this land for generations."

I extended my hand to Daniel. "Tom Carter, good to meet you, Daniel."

Daniel’s grip was firm but gentle, his eyes never leaving mine as we shook hands. "Daniel Black Elk," he said in a voice that was low and smooth. "Welcome to Pine Creek."

Earl wasted no time getting down to business. He spread a map of the area across the table and tapped at it with his thick fingers. "This is your territory now. The Pine Creek region is thousands of acres of forest, mountains, rivers, and lakes. You’ll be responsible for these areas, keeping an eye out for anything unusual."

I nodded, trying to absorb the sheer scale of the territory. "Anything I should be particularly looking for?"

"Everything," Earl said flatly. "This ain’t some well-maintained national park. It’s rough terrain. Weather changes fast, animals aren’t always friendly, and the nearest help is hours away. If you get in trouble out there, you're on your own. So don’t get into trouble."

His tone left no room for argument, and I nodded again. He wasn’t exaggerating. The sheer remoteness of the place was beginning to sink in.

"What about the poaching?" I asked. "Who’s behind it?"

Earl leaned back in his chair, a grim look on his face. "Locals, mostly. Some of ‘em hunt for sport, some for money. Wolves, elk, bears, you name it. They know the forest better than most, and they don’t take kindly to us rangers poking around their business."

I frowned. "Sounds like it could get dangerous."

"It can," Earl said, then looked out the window, the muscles in his jaw tightening. "But there’s worse out there than poachers."

His words hung in the air like a fog, and for a moment, a heavy silence settled over the room. Daniel glanced at Earl but said nothing. There was an unspoken tension between the two of them, something I wasn’t privy to yet.

"Like what?" I asked, breaking the silence.

Earl’s eyes flicked back to me, hard and cold. "Just keep your wits about you, and don’t go out there trying to be a hero and get yourself or anyone else hurt."

The first week of patrols was uneventful, but the forest had a way of unsettling me even when nothing happened. The trees loomed tall and silent, their trunks dark and twisted, like ancient giants frozen in time. Every rustle of leaves or snap of a twig set my nerves on edge, and I constantly found myself looking over my shoulder, expecting to see something lurking in the shadows. I reminded myself that I would get used to it, with time.

Daniel accompanied me on a few of my first patrols, guiding me through the more difficult terrain. He rarely spoke unless it was necessary, but when he did, it was always to point out something I would have otherwise missed, like animals tracks or a hole to avoid stepping in. His knowledge of the land was impressive, and though he was quiet, I appreciated his presence. There was something calming about him, like he was in tune with the land in a way I couldn’t yet comprehend. I felt safe with him.

One afternoon, while we were hiking through a particularly dense section of the forest, I asked more about him and what his story was.

"My family’s been here for centuries," Daniel said, his voice low. "Long before the park was established, before the settlers came. My people have always been the stewards of this land. We know its secrets."

"Secrets?" I asked, curious.

Daniel paused, looking out at the trees with a distant expression. "The land remembers. It has its own memory, and its own spirits. There are more things out here then just man and animals."

I felt a chill run down my spine at his words, but I wasn’t sure if he was being serious or if it was just part of his culture. Maybe he was just speaking metaphorically? Still, there was something about the way he spoke, so matter of fact, that made me believe him.

That evening, after we returned to the station, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Every shadow felt like it was something following me, and every gust of wind carried whispers to my ears. I had been on edge already, and the conversation with Daniel didn’t help.

Earl brushed off my concerns when I mentioned to him what Daniel had said about there being more in the forest than just man or animal.

"Ah, that’s just first week jitters," he said. "The forest can get under your skin if you let it. Just stick to your patrols and don’t go looking for trouble. We all felt like that when we were new. And don’t go listening to none of Daniel’s superstitions. The guy knows his stuff but he can get a little out there, if you know what I mean"

I wanted to believe him, but the unease gnawed at me, a constant presence at the back of my mind. A few days later, I was out on patrol by myself, covering the western section of the forest. The day was overcast, and the clouds hung low and heavy, casting everything in a dull, gray light. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, and the forest was eerily quiet, the usual sounds of wildlife absent. I vaguely recalled something in my training about when the forest goes silent.

As I made my way through a clearing, I spotted something unusual near the edge of the tree line. At first, I thought it was just a pile of leaves or debris, but as I got closer, I realized it was the mangled remains of an animal.

My heart sank as I knelt down to examine the scene. The animal, what looked like had been a deer, had been completely ripped apart, its flesh torn and shredded in a way that didn’t seem natural. The bite marks were too large and jagged to be from any predator I knew of in the area. I’d seen wolf kills before, and this wasn’t the same. It was savage, brutal, almost as if whatever had killed it had done so for sport rather than for food.

The ground around the carcass was disturbed, the grass flattened and trampled as if there had been some kind of struggle. But what stood out to me the most were the tracks. They were large, far larger than any wolf or bear, and they were shaped... different. The toes were elongated, almost claw-like, and they dug deep into the soil, leaving deep impressions.

My stomach churned as I took a few steps back, my hand instinctively going to the radio on my belt.

"Earl," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I found something. Looks like a poaching site, maybe, but... something’s not right."

"What do you mean, not right?" Earl’s voice crackled over the radio.

"The animal... it’s been torn apart. And the tracks... I’ve never seen anything like them. They’re freaking huge."

There was a long pause on the other end, and when Earl finally spoke again, his voice was tense. "Where are you?"

"I’m about a mile west of the old logging road, near the clearing."

"Head back to the station. Now."

The urgency in his voice sent a jolt of adrenaline through me, and I didn’t waste any time. As I turned to head back, I caught movement out of the corner of my eye.

Something was moving between the trees, darting from trunk to trunk with a speed that made my heart skip a beat. I froze, my eyes scanning the dense forest, but whatever it was had already disappeared into the shadows.

I stood there for what felt like an eternity, my pulse pounding in my ears, but there was no further movement. Still, the feeling of being watched lingered, a heavy weight pressing down on me as I made my way back to the station as fast as I could.

When I returned to the station, Earl was waiting for me at the door, his expression unreadable.

"Show me the site," he said, grabbing his rifle from the rack by the door.

I nodded and led him back into the forest, my nerves still on edge from the encounter. As we approached the clearing, I pointed out the carcass and the tracks, watching as Earl knelt down to examine them.

He didn’t say anything for a long time, his brow furrowed in thought. Finally, he stood up, a grim look on his face.

"Could be a bear," he said, but I could tell even he didn’t believe it.

"Bears don’t leave tracks like that," I said quietly.

Earl shot me a sharp look, but before he could respond. Daniel pulled up to the site in his truck, his face as calm and unreadable as ever. Daniel examined the site for a moment, before Earl again said, “grizzly I think, by the looks of it”.

"That’s no grizzly” Daniel said softly, his eyes locked on the tracks. "that’s something else."

Earl’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, the two of them exchanged a look. There was something they weren’t telling me, something they both knew but were hesitant to say out loud.

"Well, what is it then?" I asked, impatiently, feeling a knot of dread forming in my stomach.

Daniel glanced at me, "We should head back. It’s getting dark."

I wanted to press him for more information, but the tone in his voice left no room for argument. We made our way back to the station in silence, the weight of the unknown pressing down on me like a suffocating blanket.

That night, after Earl had gone to bed, I found myself sitting in the kitchen with Daniel. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows, and the fire crackled softly in the fireplace.

"What’s really out there?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Daniel didn’t answer right away. He stared into the fire, his dark eyes reflecting the flickering flames. Finally, he spoke, his voice low and steady.

"You ever heard of the Wendigo?"

I frowned, "Wendigo, that’s like an old native american thing right?" I asked.

"It’s an old legend, yes" Daniel said, his eyes never leaving the fire. "A spirit of the forest. Some say it was once a man, a hunter who became lost in the wilderness and resorted to cannibalism to survive. But in doing so, he became something else, something cursed. The Wendigo is a creature of hunger, always starving, always hunting. It craves flesh, and once it tastes it, it becomes insatiable."

I felt a chill crawl up my spine at his words, but I tried to keep my voice steady. "So you’re saying, that’s what is out there?”

Daniel finally looked at me, his expression serious. "I don’t know. But there are stories. The Wendigo can mimic voices, lure people into the woods. It’s fast, faster than anything natural. And once it sets its sights on you, it won’t stop until it’s fed."

I swallowed hard, the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end. "And if it finds you?"

Daniel’s gaze was unwavering. "You run. You don’t stop. You don’t look back. And you pray it loses interest."

His words hung in the air like a dark omen, and as I lay in bed that night, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching us from the shadows of the forest.

The next morning, Earl ordered a full patrol of the area. He was visibly tense, though he tried to maintain his usual gruff demeanor. We split up. Earl took the north, I took the west, and Daniel headed east. As I made my way through the forest, the weight of Daniel’s story pressed on me like a heavy stone, and I honestly began to rethink my career choice.

The forest felt different today. The usual sounds of birds and rustling leaves were absent, replaced by an eerie stillness that kept me on edge. Every step I took seemed too loud, the crunch of twigs under my feet echoing through the trees. The wind had picked up, carrying with it the faint scent of something rotten, something that made my stomach turn.

I found myself constantly scanning the trees, searching for any sign of movement. My nerves were shot, every shadow a potential threat, every gust of wind a whisper of something sinister. As I ventured deeper into the forest, the trees grew closer together, their branches intertwining overhead like a canopy of twisted arms.

Then, I heard it. A low, guttural growl, so deep. It was faint, so faint that I almost thought I imagined it. My heart leapt into my throat, and I stopped in my tracks, my hand going to the gun on my hip.

I listened, straining to hear it again.

For a long moment, there was only silence. Then, from somewhere behind me, came the sound of something moving through the undergrowth. It sounded fast, impossibly fast. I spun around, my pulse racing, but there was nothing there. Just the trees, silent.

I took a step back, my hand tightening on my gun. The growl came again, this time louder, closer. I turned, my heart hammering in my chest, and saw something moving between the trees. It was a shadow, long and gaunt, darting from trunk to trunk with a speed that made my stomach churn.

I couldn’t see it clearly, just flashes of pale skin, long limbs, and glowing eyes that burned with an unnatural light. The creature lunged with an inhuman grace, its body almost serpentine as it weaved between the trees. And then, as quickly as it had appeared, it vanished into the shadows.

My heart was pounding so hard I thought I might have a heart attack. I stood frozen, my breath coming in short, ragged gasps, my gun drawn but useless in my trembling hands. For a moment, I considered calling out to Earl or Daniel, but something told me that making noise would only draw it closer.

Then, from deep in the forest, I heard my name.

"Tom..."

The voice was faint, almost a whisper, but unmistakable. It was Earl’s voice, calling to me from somewhere beyond the trees. For a moment I felt relieved, I had been found. My instincts screamed at me to run toward it, to get out of there, The voice, it sounded so real, so close.

"Tom, over here!"

I took a step forward, my mind racing, then I paused. Earl shouldn’t be this far into my section of the forest. He was supposed to be on the north patrol, miles from here. But the voice, it was sounded just like Earl.

"Tom!"

This time, it was louder, more insistent. I took another step, my legs trembling beneath me. Something about the voice was wrong, though. It sounded like Earl, but there was an edge to it, a sharpness that sent a shiver down my spine.

Suddenly, Daniel’s voice echoed in my mind: *"It can mimic voices. Lure people into the woods..."*

I stopped in my tracks, my heart racing. It wasn’t Earl. It couldn’t be.

"Tom!"

The voice was closer now, but I didn’t move. I couldn’t move. My breath came in short, panicked gasps, and the forest around me seemed to close in, the trees towering over me.

Then, from behind me, came a rustling sound, soft at first, but growing louder, closer. I didn’t dare turn around. Every instinct in my body told me not to look, not to acknowledge whatever was behind me.

But the rustling grew louder, and I could feel something watching me, approaching me, something predatory. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. 

Everything became silent.

“Tom” it whispered, this time directly in my ear.

I ran.

I didn’t think, didn’t look back. I just ran, my feet pounding the forest floor, my breath coming in ragged gasps. The trees blurred past me as I sprinted through the forest, branches whipping at my face, the wind roaring in my ears.

I could hear it behind me, its footsteps impossibly fast, closing the distance with terrifying speed. My lungs burned, my legs screamed in protest, but I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.

Somehow, I made it to the edge of the forest and stumbled into the clearing. I collapsed to the ground, gasping for air, my body trembling with exhaustion and fear.

When I finally looked back, the thing was gone. But the feeling of being watched still remained. I felt as if were prey, and it had just been playing with its food.

When I returned to the station, Earl and Daniel were waiting for me. Earl’s face was pale, his usual gruff demeanor replaced by a quiet tension that unnerved me. He looked worried.

"What happened?" Earl asked, his voice tight.

I told them everything, the growl, the creature, the voice. As I spoke, Daniel’s expression grew darker, his eyes narrowing in thought. Earl, however, remained silent, his jaw clenched.

When I finished, the room was filled with an oppressive silence. Finally, Daniel spoke.

"You encountered it, the Wendigo," he said, his voice low.

Earl shot him a sharp look. "Don’t start with that bullshit."

"It’s not bullshit," Daniel said, his tone firm. "You saw the tracks. You heard the voice yourself once too, Earl. You know what’s out there. You’ve always known."

I looked between them, confusion and fear swirling in my mind. "What’s going on? What do you mean?”

Earl let out a long, weary sigh, rubbing a hand over his face. "Yeah, I heard a voice once too, calling me" he said, his voice heavy with reluctance. "But, it’s just some old legend".

I felt a cold knot form in my stomach. "And it’s hunting me?"

Daniel nodded. "It’s been here long before the park was established, long before any of us. It’s a part of the land, tied to it. And once it sets its sights on you..."

He didn’t finish the sentence, but he didn’t have to. The weight of his words was clear.

I swallowed hard, my mouth dry. "So what do I do?"

Earl and Daniel exchanged a long, tense look before Daniel finally spoke.

"We’ll stay in groups for a few days, until we figure it out”.

The days that followed were a blur of fear and paranoia. Every patrol felt like a death sentence, every rustle of leaves or snap of a twig sending my heart into overdrive. The Wendigo was out there, watching, waiting, and I knew it wouldn’t stop until it had what it wanted, me.

But I wasn’t going to give it the chance. I wouldn’t be caught off guard.

One night, after a particularly tense day of patrols, I sat down with Daniel by the fire. The wind howled outside, but inside the station, it was quiet.

"Have you seen it before yourself?" I asked, breaking the silence.

Daniel didn’t answer right away. He stared into the fire, his expression distant. Finally, he nodded.

"Once," he said. "When I was younger. My father and I were out hunting. We thought it was a bear at first, but, when we saw it, darting between the trees…well, we never spoke of it again."

The fire crackled softly between us, the flames casting long shadows on the walls. Outside, the wind howled, and somewhere in the distance, I could have sworn I heard a low, guttural growl.

I didn’t sleep that night. And in the morning, I knew one thing for certain. The Wendigo was still out there, and it wasn’t done with me yet.
