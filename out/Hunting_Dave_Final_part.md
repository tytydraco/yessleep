Dave looked at Britney's severed arm and started walking towards it. He got closer and closer....then walked right past it. He was now walking towards Britney.


"W-wait why didn't it work? I did exactly what that damn book said." Britney said , You could hear the fear in her voice. Her legs were trembling , It was clear that she was realising the situation she was in after her plan failed.


Dave now got closer to her , He was right in front of her. He raised 2 of its arms up , Britney just stood there frozen from fear. Dave brought down his 2 arms in full force to crush her.


I barely made it in time to tackle her out of Dave's way , But the shockwave from his smash still created a shockwave which made us hit a tree. 


I looked at Britney , She finally had control over her body again possibly due to the pain from hitting the tree. She suddenly looked at me and asked.


"How did the fucking ritual work for you but not for me?" 


I just stared at her with disbelief, She almost just died and all she cares about is the ritual?


"Are you gonna say something or what?" She yelled at me.


"I don't know. Maybe cause the ritual works on unnaturals and Dave is not a fucking unnatural?" I snapped back at her.


She flinched a bit , She wasn't expecting me to yell back. Dave suddenly growled , Looking at us but not making a move. 


"You're a UNF member right? Do you have something to fight it? Maybe like a weapon or a pet unnatural?" I said to Britney.


"Uh no. I came here to make Dave into my pet unnatural. I have no other way to fight it" She replied.


Seriously these kids are so fucking dumb. She seriously came here without any way to fight him? 


"Well just stay back and don't get in my way then." I said to her. 


I looked towards Dave. He was just standing there, Waiting for me to make a move. Honestly I have no idea how to win this one , That guy already overpowered me when he had 4 arms but now he had 6. 


Not to mention I have to protect this kid behind me. I was sweating , I knew that this fight might be my last one. Honestly I wanted to run away , But there's no way I can leave Britney behind and let Dave be on the loose. 


I charged towards Dave , I made my left arm into a long rapier and went straight for the eye in its chest. I was about to hit it when Dave covered the eye with 4 of his arms , My rapier was not able to go through.


I jumped back , Suddenly 4 of Dave's arms detached from the side of its body. The 4 arms merged into his chest creating a meat shield around the eye. Dave knew that I knew his weak spot and covered it , The good news is that now I only have to deal with 2 of his arms. 


So I went for his 2nd weak spot , the head. I turned my arm into a scythe and jumped up into the air to slash his head off. I suddenly got a quick [flashback](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/o335yWlOBC) and just like last time , Dave grabbed my leg and threw me into a tree. 


I have to stop making such simple moves , Especially when they've been countered before. I tried getting up but the damage was quite a bit , It would take me a few minutes before I could get up again. 


Dave ignored me and went towards Britney. She again froze in fear , Dave grabbed her and pulled her close to his head. He opened her mouth forcefully and then opened his mouth , He put his open mouth on her open mouth and you could barely see some kind of red goo flowing from his mouth into her. He was trying to turn her into one of his eggs.


I watched , I couldn't get up yet. My arm was bleeding due to the impact , All I could do was watch.


*What is it that you wish to do?*


"I.....wish to protect her" I said.


*LIES , WHAT IS IT THAT YOU TRULY WISH TO DO?*


"I.... want to fucking kill Dave" I said.


*Raise your arm*


I held up my left arm.


*Direct it towards your target*


I pointed it towards Dave.


*Imagine raw power in your palm*


I imagined what I felt was raw power in my palm. Suddenly the symbols on my arm started glowing red. The blood from my bleeding arm started flowing into my palm.


*Compress it into a projectile*


I imagined it to become a small ball. The blood compressed into a small ball , Very dense.


*Shoot*


"What?" I said.


*SHOOT*


I imagined it to shoot. The symbol on the back side of my palm that wasn't glowing before started glowing. The ball shot out of my hand like a bullet , Piercing right through Dave's back into the eye.


Dave let out a final scream before falling down , Losing his grip on Britney. Dave's flesh started melting away , Only leave a deformed human dead body behind. 


I went over to check on Britney , She was unconscious but.....her arm had mysteriously grown back. I carried her body to the car that I had seen before. 


I started turning on the car , It took a few attempts but it started. Now I'm driving back to Daniela , Hopefully she has found something useful. Even if She hasn't, We'll get the information out of [Britney.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnnaturalUniverse/s/934VH5mpe4)
