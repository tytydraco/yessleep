I should write this down while I still can. While my mind still works. While I'm still able to think clearly. The knowledge is eating away at me, but maybe... maybe if I share it, the weight will be easier to bear. Or maybe I just want everyone else to feel this emptiness too. Misery loves company, right?

It started with the accident last year. The one that should have killed me — metal crumpling, glass shattering, the world spinning. The doctors said I was clinically dead for six minutes. Six minutes here. And in that moment, I seemed to find paradise.

Even now, I can still feel the warmth of that place clinging to me. It's not comforting, it's a reminder. A cruel whisper of something I may never have again. Every waking moment I am here, I yearn for it like a drug that never leaves me.

How do you describe perfection to someone who's never seen it? It's like trying to explain color to the blind.

In heaven, every moment was... complete. The light didn't cast shadows — not because it was too bright, but because darkness couldn't exist there at all. The air itself felt alive, wrapping around you like a mother's embrace, if mothers were made of pure love and understanding. No pain. No sadness. No worry. Just peace so deep it made you forget you ever knew anything else.

I wish I'd stayed there for eternity. But that's the problem, isn't it? Because I did come back. And now everything here feels wrong. Colors are muted, like someone drained all the life from them. Food tastes like ash in my mouth. Music is just noise. Even the air feels heavy, contaminated with all the imperfections I never noticed before.

This morning, I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror. For a moment, I didn't recognize myself. My eyes... they're different now. Emptier. Like windows someone forgot to close, letting all the warmth escape. Sometimes when I look too long, I swear I can see through my own skin, like I'm already starting to fade.

My mom shouted at me yesterday. "Please, honey, speak to me. Tell me what's wrong." Her voice cracked, desperate. If only you knew, Mom. If only you knew. But even if I told you, you wouldn't believe me. How could you?

If you saw what I saw, then... I wonder, would it ruin you too? Would it make you yearn for something you can never have?

I know what you did, Mom. The sins you have made. You broke one of the rules. I may be yours, but I'm not Dad's. Your name in heaven has already been crossed off.

I met Dad there, you know. He wasn't the bitter man who left when I was twelve. He was... whole. Complete. He said he still loved you, Mom. Even after everything. Even knowing the truth.

Do you know what happens to those whose names are crossed off?

No, not the hell you think of, not even the eternal suffering written in whatever religious book you believe in. That's just for the worst of the worst. What happens to the crossed-off ones is something else — they simply remain.

I've started seeing them. The fading ones. They're everywhere once you know how to look. That old man who sits in the park every day? His edges blur when the sun hits him just right. The woman at the intersection always stands at the same spot, staring at the place where it happened. Sometimes they look at me, only to go back to their wallowing. They're still here, still feeling everything, but they're not really part of this world anymore. Not part of any world.

You might think I am afraid and terrified of them, with some unlucky ones having holes in places of their body and severed parts that only allowed them to drag their bodies around. But instead, I feel pity.

They're not just ghosts. Imagine being tied to your body even as it rots away. Feeling every agonizing moment as your form decays and fades, becoming less and less. You try to hold on to your thoughts, but they dissolve like sand through your fingers, leaving only the unbearable awareness of everything you're losing. It never stops. The feeling, the awareness — they linger, a cruel punishment till everything you are fades away to dust.

That's what the people there told me anyway. The ones who welcomed me to Heaven, the ones who warned me about the rules. They told me every action has consequences now. Every word either brings me closer to or further from that perfect place. And I can feel myself changing, becoming something rigid and careful. Each movement calculated; each word weighed against eternity.

Last night, I tried to eat dinner with Mom. She made my favorite pasta, trying so hard to reach me. As I watched her move around the kitchen, I felt a pang of guilt — and something else. Pity, maybe? Love? I'm not sure anymore. I smiled at her, but it wasn't real. Not the kind that reaches your eyes. It's hard to feel anything real now.

I want to warn her. Want to tell her what's coming. But I can't. If I do, would it make her try to change? Could she change? Or would it just ruin her, the way it's ruined me?

Sometimes, when it's very quiet, I can still hear that perfect silence calling to me. And I know, deep down, that I'll do anything to answer it. But until then, I live. I continue, every waking moment worrying that I've done something wrong, something that might cross out my name.

I'm sorry for sharing this.

But then again, you don't need to believe me, do you? You can think of me as just another crazy person on the internet. After all, who would believe something so impossible? Maybe I am just fooling you, or fooling myself. Maybe this is just a side effect of the medicine I'm taking. I just wanted to share this — not to convince you, nor to make you believe. Only to unburden myself.

And when the time comes, I'll be ready to go back.
