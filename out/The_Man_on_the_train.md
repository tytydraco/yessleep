Mark had just gotten on his train home, the rhythmic humming of the tracks soothed Marks aching head, the fluorescent lights of the cart beamed at him as if they where calling for his attention, Mark simply shut his eyes. Then something else got on with him

Mark barely noticed at first, though he felt the “man’s” presence immediately, the cold harsh taste of iron spread across his tongue and the air became damp like an unseen mould had grown around him. Mark opened his eyes still staring up at the ceiling before lowering his head, it was sitting right across from him. Mark almost screamed from the sheer shock of it, he hadn’t even heard a shuffling of clothes or the steps of the man as he got on the train he was simply there, as if he had been sitting there since the start. Mark couldn’t help but recoil slightly upon seeing the thing sitting across from him as one thought echoed throught his mind, “this is wrong”. The “man” across from him wore a loose black suit that sat on him with an unnatural weightlessness, his bowler hat did not tilt or move on his head instead remaining still as if it had been glued on, the things body was oddly shaped even with the covering of the suit with of lumps and jagged points poking out in the most unnatural of ways, its skin stretched tight over its deformed body as if something greater and older than possible lay just beneath the surface. It lifted its head to meet Marks eyes, its face was an image of the uncanny, its eyes weren’t quite a colour they where closer to a pearlescent grey encircling vanta black pin pricks that seemed to look into Mark, it’s hair was a sloppy wig poorly hidden under its hat clearly only intended to be viewed face on, it’s mouth was less a mouth and more a lipless gash that exposed grey rigged teeth, like scrap metal piercing it’s gums. And then it spoke

“Hello friend”, the thing spoke as if it was trying to eat its own words, Mark felt sick, he didn’t want to talk to this thing, he deep down knew that he shouldn’t even be able to talk to it, but something forced him to, “h..hi, do I know you?”, Mark knew he had never met this man, he would have remembered that face, that horribly wrong face, it spoke again “you look sad, i want you to know that” its words carried a thick sense of cold malice, absent of all joy, Mark tried to get up, he tried to get away from this mockery of a man, but he couldn’t “is there something I can help you with?”, it didn’t respond right away, instead choosing to stair deeper into Mark, cutting through him layer by layer, after a while it spoke again “I’ve seen you before, have you seen me?” Marks heart skipped a beat, the idea of this man watching him from some unknown space made him shiver with fear, “w…what do you want with me? I think you…you might have the wrong person”, Angelos smile grew just slightly wider, the corners of its lipless maw nearly ripping under this subtle change, for one last time he spoke “I don’t, you’ll realise that soon”. Then the train stopped, the “man” stood up only breaking eye contact to leave the train, its movements were stiff and jittery like some sort of mannequin manipulated by an invisible force. Mark did not breathe a sigh of relief, he couldn’t feel safe anymore, those last words spreading through his brain like a disease. “You’ll realise that soon”. God If only Mark knew what was to come
