The old house creaked and groaned as I made my way up the narrow staircase, each step a protest against my intrusion. It had been almost 3 months since Grandpa passed away, leaving behind this Victorian monstrosity and all its secrets. Mom had been putting off the task of clearing it out, but with the property going on the market next month, we couldn't delay any longer.

I paused at the top of the stairs, letting my eyes adjust to the gloom. Dust motes danced in the thin shafts of light that managed to penetrate the heavy velvet curtains. The air was thick with the musty scent of age and neglect.

"You okay up there, honey?" Mom's voice drifted up from below.

"Yeah, I'm fine," I called back, trying to keep the unease out of my voice. "Just getting my bearings."

I made my way down the hallway, running my fingers along the faded wallpaper. Family portraits watched me with judgmental eyes, generations of stern faces seemingly disapproving of my presence. At the end of the hall stood Grandpa's study, a room I'd rarely been allowed to enter as a child.

The door opened with a reluctant creak, revealing a space frozen in time. Books lined every wall, their leather spines cracked and faded. Grandpa's massive oak desk dominated the center of the room, its surface cluttered with papers, odd trinkets, and what looked like animal bones.

But it was the cabinet in the corner that drew my attention. I'd always wondered what Grandpa kept in there, behind those intricately carved doors. As a kid, I'd imagined treasure maps or exotic artifacts from his travels. Now, as an adult, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation as I approached it.

The cabinet's brass key was cool against my palm as I turned it in the lock. The mechanism released with a soft click, and I held my breath as I slowly opened the doors.

The musty smell of aged wood intensified, mixing with something else—something organic and unpleasant. I squinted into the shadowy interior, my eyes struggling to make sense of the shapes within. My fingers brushed against something cold and... fleshy?

"What the hell?" I muttered, pulling my hand back instinctively.

Steeling myself, I reached in again, this time grasping the object firmly. As I pulled it out, a chill ran down my spine. There, cradled in my trembling hands, was a pig's head. But this was no ordinary severed head—it was alive.

Its eyes, beady and black, blinked at me. No blood, no sign of trauma. It was as if it had grown this way, never knowing the touch of a body.

"G-Grandpa?" I called out, my voice barely above a whisper. "What is this?"

The head's snout twitched, and to my horror, it spoke.

"He can't hear you," it said, its voice a guttural whisper. "He's been gone for months. But I... I've been waiting for you."

I screamed, dropping the head onto the hardwood floor. It didn't splatter or roll away. Instead, it righted itself, those terrible eyes fixing on me once more.

"Don't be afraid," it cooed. "I'm family too, in a way. Your grandfather made sure of that."

My mind reeled. What had Grandpa done? What dark secrets had he kept hidden in this old cabinet all these years?

As I backed away, the head began to move, inching towards me like some nightmarish snail.

"Where are you going?" it asked, a hint of amusement in its inhuman voice. "We have so much to talk about... so much to share."

Days passed, but I couldn't bring myself to leave the house. The head—I'd started calling it Porcine in my mind—sat on the coffee table, watching my every move.

"You look tired," Porcine observed, its tone almost sympathetic. "Having trouble sleeping?"

I laughed bitterly. "How could I sleep with you... with this?"

Porcine's eyes seemed to soften. "Your grandfather couldn't sleep either, at first. But he came to appreciate my company. In time, so will you."

I shook my head violently. "No! This isn't right. You shouldn't exist!"

"But I do," Porcine replied calmly. "And I'm the key to everything your family has been searching for. Immortality, power... it's all within reach."

My grandfather's journals flashed through my mind—his cryptic writings about cheating death, about forbidden knowledge. I had always thought they were the ramblings of a man losing his grip on reality. But now...

"What... what are you?" I asked, my voice barely audible.

Porcine's mouth curved into what could only be described as a smile. "I am the future. Your future. Our future. All you have to do is embrace it."

As if in a trance, I found myself reaching out, my fingertips brushing against Porcine's leathery skin. A jolt of energy surged through me, and suddenly, I understood.

The choice lay before me: resist and cling to my fragile humanity, or surrender to the dark promise Porcine offered. As the sun set outside, casting long shadows across the room, I made my decision.

And somewhere, in the depths of my mind, I could hear my grandfather laughing.

As I sit here, my hands shaking while I type, I can hardly believe the events of the past few days. The scratches on my arms have barely begun to heal, serving as a constant reminder that what transpired was horrifyingly real.

It had been only two days since I discovered Porcine, the living pig's head, in my grandfather's cabinet. Two days of whispered conversations and dark promises. I had been so engrossed in unraveling the mysteries Porcine offered that I had almost forgotten why I was in the house in the first place.

"Mom?" I called out, suddenly realizing I hadn't seen her since that first day. The house responded with an eerie silence.

I found her in the parlor, and the sight froze my blood. There she sat, in Grandpa's old armchair, with Porcine nestled in her lap. Blood dripped from her eyes, leaving crimson trails down her gaunt cheeks. She was murmuring softly, words I couldn't understand.

"Mom?" I whispered, taking a tentative step forward.

Her head snapped up, eyes wild and unfocused. She began speaking rapidly, but the words were foreign to me. Swahili, I realized with a start. How did she know Swahili?

As I watched in horror, she lifted Porcine and pressed her lips against its snout in a grotesque kiss. That's when I noticed how drained she looked, as if something had been feeding on her very life force.

"Mom, stop!" I lunged forward, trying to pull Porcine away from her.

She let out an inhuman shriek, her nails raking across my arms as she fought to keep hold of the head. The pain was sharp, but adrenaline pushed me forward. I wrenched Porcine from her grasp and ran.

Her screams echoed through the house as she gave chase. I could hear her body slamming against walls, her movements erratic and uncontrolled. Reaching the second-floor landing, I did the only thing I could think of – I hurled Porcine out the window.

What happened next will haunt me forever. Without hesitation, my mother sprinted towards the broken window and threw herself out after Porcine. The sickening thud that followed will ring in my ears for years to come.

I rushed downstairs and out into the yard. Mom lay unconscious on the overgrown lawn, but Porcine was nowhere to be seen. Acting on instinct, I scooped up my mother's limp form and carried her to the car. I had to get her away from here, away from that thing.

As I drove to the nearest hospital, I made a decision. I had to end this. After ensuring Mom was in good hands, I returned to the property. It took hours of searching, but I finally found Porcine hiding in the garden shed. This time, I was prepared. I sealed it in a weighted bag and drove to the lake on the outskirts of town.

As I watched the bag sink into the murky depths, I felt a mix of relief and lingering dread. Was it truly over?

Mom was released from the hospital a few days later, with no memory of what had transpired. The doctors were baffled by her condition, noting severe dehydration and exhaustion as if she hadn't eaten or slept for weeks. We decided to return home, leaving the old house and its horrors behind.

But the nightmare hasn't fully ended. The scratches Mom left on my arms have scarred, a permanent reminder of that terrifying day. Sometimes, in the dead of night, I hear her crying out in her sleep, words in Swahili tumbling from her lips. I lie awake, wondering if I truly managed to break whatever hold Porcine had over her.

As for me, I'm left with questions that may never be answered. What was Porcine? What had my grandfather uncovered? And most chillingly – as I look at the faint, pig-like shape that seems to be forming on my forearm where Mom scratched me – did I truly escape unscathed?

I write this account not knowing if anyone will believe me, but needing to put it into words before... before whatever might happen next. If you're reading this, beware of family secrets.
