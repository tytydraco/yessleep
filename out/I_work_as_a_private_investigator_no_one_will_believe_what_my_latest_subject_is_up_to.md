Tap. Tap. Tap. Rain pattered on the windscreen, turning the buildings into blurry ghosts. Chilly autumn winds blew, crept ever so slowly into every crack and crevice of the car. The radio babbled about the skyrocketing number of head injuries, a quick visit to the doctor would fix it, they said. I tapped my cigarette, took a drag and blew out another puff of smoke.  The waiting sucked, but the fruit that comes after would be sweet.

I’m a private investigator. My specialty: extramarital affairs. Inside the profession I’m rather reputed, or notorious, whatever you prefer, title does not concern me, only that my results are known. I follow my subjects with a profundity of a well-seasoned hunter, tracking, waiting, springing the trap, and when the time is right, moving in for the finishing blow.

My client this time: an old, haggish, loneliness-stricken wife of a famous lawyer – the kind that writers compare to blood-sucking leeches, that movie makers target as all-too-willing villains in their legal dramas, that kind. My target: the husband. You know the type: white, old and powerful, graying hair combed back, possibly using French cologne, wearing bespoke suits and Italian shoes and probably speak slowly using curt sentences as if to issue an order.

The scenario: the husband had been coming home later and later into the night, and was effectively estranging his wife. A woman’s instinct tells the client that something is off, and not the so-busy-he-stays-at-the-office kind of off, but rather something of the female persuasion. The locations: the target’s private law firm, smack right in the middle of a bustling downtown, and of course, his private suburban condo that their family lends to occasional holidayers. The exact details don’t matter. As I said, I’m a professional. Confidentiality is at the foremost of my skillset.

You may be wondering why I’m writing this if secrecy matters so much. Well, to tell the truth, this is the only way that I can make sense of the things that happened. And if my words reach out to the lucky, or rather unlucky few that also encountered the things that I’m about to describe to you, then it is enough.

Suffice it to say, I’m no stranger to cases like these. The husband would be bored of his old, crusty wife and went out in search of new muses and inspirations. The inspirations would turn to flirting, flirting to long nights of sex and drugs, then fizzle out into an apology to the wife and a return to form. Sometimes it would get interesting and there would be fights, arguments and eventually divorce. But I’m detached now, desensitized, it’s simply another case.

And so I sat in my car, expecting my target to leave his office, by him a young and sprightful secretary. Right on cue, as the rain died out, the target got down from the building and entered the parking lot, hand in hand with a red head. She was gorgeous, tall nose, symmetrical face, supple breasts and firm ass cleverly revealed under a thin layer of scarlet dress, the kind that drew stares at the office. A contusion on her forehead the only speck of imperfection in a flawless look. A medicated and calculated look. They went hand-in-hand into his black Mercedes. I followed aptly. I already knew their route. They would cut through the intersection, then bank left out of the downtown towards the expressway and then head into the target’s condo. I followed them, keeping a safe distance and when the Mercedes stopped, I parked my car at a hidden corner.

The target and the girl stood looking around a little bit. I had followed their case for about a month. This was the day they would move past verbal flirting and into the good stuff. I found a nearby tree, made sure they made it into the house before climbing up. The darkness enveloped the surrounding, though it was only 7 p.m. The leaves rustled and the branches creaked under my weight. I leaned back against a stout and large branch, camera in hand. They were dancing, hands slowly caressing each other, then moving to unbutton. Suddenly, the target reached for his phone. It seemed he wanted to text his wife about coming home late at night. A call came. He came to the window to answer. He did not see me in the darkness. Lucky. The call finished, he moved back to the secretary, hands touching her neck, then her upper back, then her lower back, then her ass. I took out my camera and took pictures. This would be a quick job. I would receive my commission tomorrow. All I needed was one good picture of them railing each other naked. The pictures that I got were already more than enough. But as I said, I’m a professional hunter. No half-assing. This is the best part of my job. They would be caught red-handed.

He moved his hand up to her shirt, slowly unbuttoning her. The woman wore black bras, Victoria’s secret. She leaned into him. He moved his hand around her shoulders and stripped her shirt down. She did the same to his shirt. He moved his hands around her hips and then down to her skirt, unbuttoning it. She moved her hand across his belly, then undid the buckle on his belt and took down his pants. I looked at my watch, after this I would have enough time to maybe go to a nice restaurant and order a steak, medium-rare of course.

They were on the bed now, kissing and laughing. My anticipation climbed steadily. Any moment now, the sex would begin, and my work would be complete. But the woman’s laugh suddenly stopped. Her hands gripped his shoulders and she started rocking back and forth. It started out with a gentle motion but steadily grew into the kind that you would see at a metal concert. The man was visibly scared. I had to admit I was also unsettled. This chick was probably stoned out of her mind to move like that. Must have taken something in the car, something strong. The lawyer was shaking her, his mouth muttering something. But the rocking grew stronger and stronger, and in a blink, the woman’s skin split perfectly down the middle. A creature emerged, red as blood and pulsating veins wrapping exposed flesh. Its bulging eyes were yellow and large, twice as large as those of a normal human and were situated to the side of the skull. In the head, where the mouth should be, was an inexplicable hole. In a quick jerking movement, a long and bloody beak jutted out and pecked the man on the forehead. My target collapsed into the shoulder of the now bird-like creature.

I was frozen in place. It all happened in a split second. Then, just as quickly as it happened, the creature’s beak drew back into its skull and it put on the woman’s skin. Its left hand made a vertical swiping gesture and the dividing line in the skin disappeared. I checked my camera and realized I forgot to take a picture of the moment. Big mistake. I looked back at the creature which had finished putting on clothes for it and the man. It dragged the unconscious man downstairs with surprising agility and put him on the shotgun seat, then got into the car and began to drive away. I jumped to the ground and slipped, felt pain radiating from my ankle, limped to my car and drove out just in time to see the taillights.

The creature drove past the row of condos, through the suburban area and into a winding, empty road. My stalking skills were put to the test. I had to carefully maintain my distance, too close and I would alert the creature, too far and I would lose its trace. I followed the creature for what seemed like an hour on empty road, no car passed by us. In my head, a kind of morbid curiosity but also a humming, primal fear. The woman-creature drove into a wide and leveled area at the edge of the woods. I had to stop my car some hundred feet away. It opened the passenger door and put the man on its shoulder with ease, then slowly walked towards the woods. I creeped after the creature and the sound of crushed branches. My ankle ached, the pain alerting me that I must have sprained something. I bit my teeth, ignored the pain and stalked the creature, keeping a safe distance.

After following it for around 15 minutes, I could see light streaming through the branches ahead. Seemed there was a large fire. As I inched my way closer, I could hear strange sounds like the caw of a crow, but louder, more guttural, as if made with a much bigger vocal organ. I was much closer now, judging by the sounds, but the shrubs were so thick that I could not see ahead. I chose a nearby oak tree and clambered upward into a large branch. I put my good leg against the tree to hold myself up better and looked out ahead.

The sight before me was more alien than anything I have ever encountered. In the middle of a clearing, besides a small fire, there was a sort of nest made out of bones, half-plucked animal parts and dead branches. In the middle of the nest, there seemed to be two large and bloody eggs, one looked intact and there were cracks in the other. The sounds seemed to be coming from one of the eggs. I looked around and spotted the creature near slowly entering the nest. It carefully lowered the lawyer down into the ground, disrobed itself and him and, once again, with a rocking motion, split it human skin in the middle. This time, the creature completely escaped from its human shell. It was humanoid with similar arms and legs as a human, but instead of skin, it had only bleeding flesh. Its muscles were thick and blooded. The creature made a loud cawing noise. Moments later, from a dark corner of the nest, a similar but slightly bigger creature emerged. They put their head together in a sort of sick, twisted dance, gaping holes where their mouths should be and both did that ominous and uncanny rocking motion continuously until both their beaks jutted out.

Then they looked at the unconscious man. He was now slowly getting up. Seeing the creatures, he took a moment to register what was going on and then screamed at the top of his lung, his scream vibrated through the clearing then gradually died down in the thick branches. The bigger creature, its beak now fully brandished, pecked the man on the forehead again. His body ragdolled backwards, motionless. Then it took its hands and split the man vertically right in the middle and, with a fluid motion, drew out his entire body, leaving the skin. Blood spurted from the man’s corpse, splashing into the creatures. My hands were shaking by this point and the cold wind in the middle of nowhere didn’t help. My eyes were glued to the creatures; I didn’t even dare blink. They started pecking at the man’s body, the force of their beaks piercing sinews, meat and bones reverberating through the woods. My sweaty hands touched my camera, and I remembered the only thing that I came here to do. I started taking pictures of them and their feast. I wouldn’t know how to explain this to my client, but at the very least I could show her how her husband was brutally murdered.

The creatures were finished with the man’s upper half now, only the lower half and the legs were left. The smaller one pecked the pieces into smaller parts, then took one leg and stood over the cracked egg. Slowly, a small creature inside the egg appeared, wide eyes on the sides, hole where its mouth should be. It started rocking back and forth and its beak drew out, pecking at the dismembered leg, tearing patches of meat from it.

A vibrating sound. My phone. Scared out of my wit, I fumbled for it from my pocket. My client was calling. She probably wanted to know if I had caught her husband in the act. In a moment’s panic, I dropped my phone, making a big thud right below the tree where I was at. Stupid. So stupid. Both creatures’ heads were turned in my direction. The smaller one stayed behind while the bigger one walked slowly towards the source of the noise. The vibration was now louder than ever. This was it. I was going to die and be food for these creatures. Strangely enough, I was enthralled by the process. I almost accepted it with a sense of finality.

Then, just as abruptly as it had started, the vibration stopped. The creature stopped in its track, its eyes darting left and right, then after what felt like an eternity, it turned back towards the nest.

Reality rushed back into my head with the force of a whirlwind. I wasn’t going to die. I didn’t want to tempt fate a second time. I already had what I needed. I made my way down the tree, careful not to make any sudden noise, retrieved my phone, put it in airplane mode, backed out of the woods and limped back into my car, looking behind every several steps to make sure I wasn’t followed. I thanked God when I saw my car. I drove back through the winding and empty road, my hands trembling. I must have gone too fast because after I passed a fork, police sirens started blaring right behind my car. I pulled to the side of the road, kept the engine running; the police officer approached my side panel and asked me to lower it. I complied.

“Whoa there, knew how fast you were goin’, son?” he leaned down with a fixed smile.

“Sorry sir, I forgot to turn off my oven” I answered, wondering if I should show him the pictures. My subconscious told me not to.

“Now whereabouts did you come from?” he continued to stare at me, eyes unblinking, the smile never leaving his lips. Something felt off.

“Sir?”

“I saw you came from that road. Seen anything interestin’ back there?

“No sir.”

I turned to look at the officer. He wore a common state uniform with a brown Stetson hat. His face was stately with burnside beards and a piercing stare. Under the flimsy headlights of his car, I thought I made out a reddish patch on his forehead, half-covered under the brim of his hat. I was keeping my composure with every ounce of mental strength I had left. My right leg hovered on the gas pedal, ready to step on it at a moment’s notice.

“I’m really sorry sir, I … just, I rushed out of my house in a hurry and forgot to turn off my oven is all” I answered. I know. Uncharacteristic of me to talk that way. But fear has a way of making you do unusual things.

The officer did not respond. He looked at me for a while. The silence grew thick. He seemed to bore deep into my soul with his gaze.

“Alright, happens to the best of us. I’m letting you go this time, but you watch that speed now, son. Wouldn’t want anything to happen to ya. You be off now” he said and gestured me to go on., the smile never fading. I thanked the officer and drove slowly out of his sight, but as soon as I was sure he could no longer see or hear me, I slammed on the gas.

At home, I printed out the pictures, made a backup to the clouds just to be sure. I couldn’t sleep the entire night. In the morning, I made for my client’s house. I sat in my car in front of her gates, thought long and hard about what to say and decided that showing her the pictures was enough explanation. I put the pictures in an envelope and rang the doorbell.

The person that answered me was the lawyer. He had two head wounds on one side of his forehead. He gave me a puzzled look.

“Can I help you?” he asked. Blood suddenly withdrew from my hands and feet, the cold seeped into every fiber of my being.

“Yes, I came to meet with your wife about a business” I stammered.

“Honey! You have a visitor” he called back towards the house then moved out of sight. My client answered and walked towards me with a big smile. I started walking to her. As her face slowly moved into the light, I saw a contusion on her forehead.

“Yes, can I help you?” she asked me with a bright smile. I stood dead in my track.

“Yes, this is about um, the business with your husband.”

“And what of my husband?” she was still smiling.

“I’m sorry ma’am, I couldn’t dig up any dirt on him. He’s clean. Spotless.”

“Well of course. He’s my husband, my darling after all” she smiled. “Is that for me?” she asked, seeing the envelope in my hand.

“No ma’am, just some paperwork that I got. You have a good day now” I answered and backed up. The woman kept smiling at me, her smile did not dissipate, as if it took effort to change from a smile into something else. I went back into my car and drove away. As my face passed her, the smile was ever-present. I drove home as fast as I could, still feeling her gaze at the back of my head.

As I’m writing this to you, my hands are still numb and sweaty from fear. It has been a couple of days since then. I’ve gone out maybe a handful of times, each time spotting more and more people with a wound on their forehead. The local news called it a head wound pandemic. I knew different. I’ve started seeing some of them skulking around my apartment after dark, their eyes peering into my curtained windows. I thought I went crazy when I saw the security guard of my apartment complex yesterday with the same injury that afflicted so many in this town. They must be coming for me. I am writing this to warn you, do not trust anyone with a wound on their forehead. Consider this a recruitment letter, arm and prepare yourselves to fight back. I am going out again today to buy weapons to defend myself. If you no longer hear from me, well, then you know the answer as to why.
