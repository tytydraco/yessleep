When I got my first gray hairs, they were only on the left side of my head. It was a little weird, sure, but since it was only a few hairs, I chalked it up to randomness.

But then a few months later, as I was getting ready for a dinner party, I noticed something else. There were only fine lines under my left eye. The skin under my right eye was perfectly smooth.

*Everyone has a good side and a bad side,* I thought. *I guess my right is my good side.*

But as I looked at my face more closely, I noticed more differences. I had a slight jowl on my left jawline. Laugh lines. More gray hairs.

Yet on my right... I looked like I was 25 years old.

Not a single gray hair. Not a single wrinkle. Hair shiny and thick.

I brought it up with my doctor, even asking about a stroke, but he claimed he couldn’t see a difference between the sides of my face. Besides—I had no facial paralysis, and a stroke wouldn’t affect the distribution of gray hair on my head.

I brought it up with my husband, John, too. He also said he couldn’t tell the difference, but offered an interesting theory. “Maybe your skin is more sun-damaged on the left because you drive so much.” Though that wouldn’t explain the hair.

When I got out of the shower, I stared at my naked body. It looked like the aging thing wasn’t just my face—my left boob was saggier. The cellulite on my left thigh cut deeper.

Now that I noticed it, I couldn’t unsee it. I looked totally asymmetric—like someone had taken half of a 35-year-old and half of a 25-year-old and stitched them together. I told my friends and my parents and they *also*insisted they couldn’t see what I was talking about.

But to me, it was obvious.

Weird thoughts seeped into my head that night:

*The right side of your face looks* better *than it did in your early thirties.*

*It’s restoring itself, like you’re a vampire or something.*

*Some weird magical force is doing this, and there is payment. A sacrifice. You just don’t know what it is yet.*

*Youth is never free.*

I started researching online. I found an urban legend about a man who had the same issue; half his face didn’t age, because he stuck his head in a particle accelerator and got hit with a proton beam (Anatoli Bugorski, for anyone curious.) Photos, however, didn’t show an appreciable difference in the sides of his face.

I began to feel like the right side of my body—the perfect, preserved, young one—wasn’t even part of me anymore. Like it was a growth, a tumor, a parasitic twin. Like it didn’t belong.

When I looked in the mirror, a fantasy would play in my head: grabbing the kitchen knife and slicing myself in two. Watching the right half of my body crawl across the bloodstained tile, down the stairs, and out into the darkness, never to be seen again.

A few weeks later—just when I started getting complacent, thinking *maybe* John and parents and friends were right—it happened.

The right side of my face moved independently for the first time.

I was brushing my hair in front of the mirror, when I blinked—except *only one eye blinked.*

*…What?*

I closed my eyes. But my right eye remained open, staring blankly back at me in the mirror.

*Nononono.*

I panicked. I did a series of expressions and movements. When I lifted my arms over my head, walked, moved my body--everything still worked as normal. But my right eye wouldn’t cooperate.

John rushed me to the ER. He thought I was having a stroke. But I had a horrible feeling whatever this was, the doctors couldn’t fix.

I closed my eyes as we drove to the hospital, trying to rest, but my right eye remained open. The road scrolling by through the window looked fuzzy and flickery, like my brain was only getting intermittent signals from it.

A dying connection.

“I can’t see right out of this eye,” I told him.

The engine *vroomed* in response, as he pressed on the gas.

Soon I was in a hospital room, nurses flocking around me, then doctors, pressing and probing and prodding. I just wanted to go home. I just wanted my face to look the same on both sides. I just wanted everything to be back to normal.

The doctors here insisted they didn’t see a difference either. But at my insistence, they took tissue samples from both sides of my face.

An hour later, a new doctor came in. I could feel the concern radiating off of him. He had bad news. I was sure of it.

He told me, with forced calm, what the results were:

The cells on the left side of my body were normal, aging at an appropriate rate.

The cells on the right side of my body were in stasis.

They resembled cells that were clinically frozen, like embryos for IVF. Alive, but not functioning. Frozen in time. “What... what would cause something like that?” I stuttered.

“I don’t know. To be honest, I’ve never seen anything like it.”

“Is it dangerous?”

“… I don’t know.”

We spent the night in the hospital, with the doctors running more tests, taking more samples. Finally, not making any headway and not seeing a clear danger—they let us go home.

John and I talked about it at length. We didn’t know what to do. Tomorrow I’d be calling down the list of specialists the ER doctor had given me.

“I love you,” he said, wrapping his arms around me.

“I love you too.”

I closed my eyes, but my right eye stayed open, watching the bedroom flicker in and out of darkness like a dying bulb.

I woke with a start at 3 AM.

I tried to roll over—but realized I couldn’t. My arm… was stuck on something? I yanked hard, starting to panic. Had John rolled on my arm or something? *What’s going on?*

My eyes adjusted to the darkness—and then I saw *exactly* what was wrong.

My right arm stretched out in the darkness.

And my right hand was locked around John’s throat.

His eyes stared up at the ceiling, blank and lifeless.
