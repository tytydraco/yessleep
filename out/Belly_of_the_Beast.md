Jonah stands in the mouth of a long, narrow hallway. The attic trapdoor lurks at the far end, down where the light never seems to reach. It sits embedded in the ceiling. Black metal stained with rust stands out against the white drywall. A fist-sized padlock seals its jaws shut. Only when the key in his pocket starts to bite into his skin does Jonah realize he’s been squeezing it. He takes a deep breath, and unwinds his hand.

Someone grabs his shoulder. He stiffens, and whips around. His mom’s hard green eyes bore into his. Jonah’s mouth falls open. He has to say something but the words won’t come. She’s figured out what he’s up to. She must have. He starts to crack. Sweat slides down the back of his neck.

Then her face softens. The clouds part, and she ruffles his hair.

“You alright honey?”

“Um…” his brain lags as he tries to re-orient. “Yeah. Yeah, I’m okay. Just worried about Dan.”

“You’ve got a big heart Jonah,” his dad says as he walks out of the kitchen, drying his hands on his shirt. A smile splits his lumberjack beard and he claps Jonah on the shoulder. “But Dan’ll be fine, I promise. He’s disappeared like this before, back when you were little. His wife was calling hospitals, police. In the end they found him at a bar a few towns over.”

“Jonah, we have to head out,” his mom cuts in, “promise me that you and Bobby will keep the doors locked and stay inside until we get back. With everything going on I need you to be careful,” she shoots his dad a venomous glance, “even if it ends up being nothing.”

“Don’t worry,” Jonah says, “we’re not dumb enough to go off on our own.” He sticks his pinky out. She wraps hers around it and reels him, planting a kiss on his forehead. He cringes, but lets it happen, she’ll leave faster if he puts her mind at ease.

When she pulls away her smile is warm and sunny. Then she checks her watch and it sours. “We’re going to be late. Did you grab the umbrellas like I asked?” she asks his dad with a pointed stare. “If we’re going to tramp around in the woods all day I’d at least like to stay dry.” He nods, raising his hands as if in surrender.

Jonah’s phone buzzes as he watches the two of them them drive off. It’s a text from Bobby, he’s five minutes out.

Another notification slides onto the screen. The battery’s on life support, stupid thing dies so fast these days. Jonah sighs and steps into the hallway. The door to his room is just inside. A growing heap of comics smothers the floor. His mom keeps nagging him to clean up in here, but she’s the one who bought him all those old issue. She only has herself to blame for the mess. He clears a path to his dresser and leaves his phone to charge. Next to the pocket knife his dad got him for this year’s birthday. Any more cleaning will have to wait.

See, Jonah’s parents will get on him about chores and homework, but most of their rules are flimsy things. In this house there is only one absolute. Do not go in the attic. Ever. His parents are photographers and it acts as their darkroom. They claim Jonah could damage the goods if he went up there, which he doesn’t dispute. But the size of that lock has always made his imagination run wild. And he’s never actually seen them up there. Or at least, he hadn’t. Not until two weeks ago. He tries to keep that night out of his head but it’s carved into his eyelids. He blinks and he’s back there, caught in the memory again.



It was two AM. Jonah had to piss, so he dragged himself out from under his comforter. He turned the knob and the door creaked open. The metal was cold in his hand.

Light scorched his unadjusted eyes. The attic was open wide. The gaping hole in the ceiling spat a sickly yellow spotlight down into the hall. A metal ladder unfurled from it. Jonah’s dad sat on one of the steps. His face tilted up towards that jaundiced glow. Basking in it. There was a sound coming from the attic. A wet, smacking sound. Reminded him of cutting watermelon for barbecues.

That was when his dad looked down and saw him. Panic flashed across his broad face. He covered it with a wan smile and rushed to usher Jonah the other way, toward the bathroom. He told him there was nothing to worry about. He and Mom just had some prints to develop. But his eyes were flint. Not even a ghost of their usual humor.

Jonah tried to forget it for weeks afterward. Really tried. But that sound, that awful sound had burrowed into his dreams. He’d wake in the middle of every night, cocooned in sweat and fear, and he’d hear it. Faintly. Out in the hall. Only when he peeked out there and saw the attic locked tight would he be able to calm down. Every morning he’d try to convince himself he was being dramatic. They were a bit strange, that’s all. He wasn’t afraid of his own dad. The gentle giant who greeted him every morning with eggs, bacon, and bad jokes.



Back in the present, Jonah pulls the attic key out of his pocket. It sits heavy in his palm. He had to scour the house for days to find it. Buried in a flower pot of all places. Who the hell does that?

He shakes his head. Trying to quiet the festering doubts. Soon he’ll see for himself that there’s nothing to worry about.

The family photos that line the walls watch Jonah as he makes his way down the hall. He opens the junk closet, the only thing down here besides the attic. Inside, clutter is piled almost to the ceiling. Jonah snorts. His mom should practice what she preaches.

He spots a folding chair near the bottom and pulls it free. The entire pile collapses the second he does. A wave of old clothes and toys and other random crap spills out into the hall, and the two black umbrellas are buried before Jonah ever sees them. He’ll worry about the mess later. There’s plenty of time.

The chair wobbles under Jonah’s feet as he strains to reach the padlock. The key slides in and it pops open with a throaty click before it thuds onto the floor. The trapdoor falls open. Folded behind it is the ladder, covered in rusty scabs. Jonah grabs it and heaves. The ladder squeals in protest as it stutters down to meet the floor. Rusted snowflakes shake loose onto the hardwood.

Something slams the front door. Four times, loud as shotgun blasts. Jonah bolts upright. Shit shit shit why are they back so soon? He’s gonna get caught. He has to do something. He tries to will himself to hide the evidence but panic has turned his limbs to stone.

“Yo Jonah! Open up man!”

Jonah goes limp with relief. Relief that instantly becomes embarrassment. He needs to get this over with.

Bobby’s lazy smile greets him as he opens the front door. He’s a short, chubby kid built like a bowling pin, with a flop of greasy brown hair above his acne-ridden face. Pair him with Jonah’s stickbug lankiness and they look like two walking carnival mirrors.

Today Bobby’s in basketball shorts and a bright blue shirt with some winking cartoon girl on the front. His eyebrows raise when he sees Jonah’s pale face, shiny with nervous sweat.

“Whatcha been up to buddy?” he asks with a sly grin.

“Shut up, asshole,” Jonah cracks a sheepish smile. “Were your parents pumped to join the search party?”

“Nope. Glad they’re not forcing me to do that shit. Weather’s gonna suck. And I still don’t get why the city’s got everyone looking for Dan ‘dickhead’ Wolfe in the first place,” he shrugs and picks at his teeth with his pinky. “Least it’s taken Jacob’s mind off beating our asses.”

Jonah chuckles, remembering the day before when Jacob, his high school tormentor, had stared out of the window in every class they shared. Silent, for once. If his dad going missing was what finally got him to shut up then maybe it’d be best if Dan stayed gone.

He shoves the thought away, disturbed. He shouldn’t be getting a kick out of that. What would his own parents think?

“Jacob’s the worst, I fully agree. But I don’t know, I still hope his dad turns back up.”

Bobby claps him on the shoulder. “You’re a better man than I, my friend. You want my take, Dan ran off to get drunk in the city. That’s what I’d do if my wife hated my guts and my son was a raging prick. The poor guy probably needed a break,” he shrugs, pushing past Jonah and into the house. “Enough about that though. The day’s finally come for you to break a rule,” he rubs his palms together and beams. “You ready to check out this dungeon, Mr. Goody Two Shoes?”

“Idiot,” Jonah says, but can’t stop himself smiling. He can always count on Bobby to help calm his nerves. “I wish it was a dungeon. My parents aren’t nearly that exciting.”

“That’s what you think,” Bobby says as he disappears down the hall, “but I’ve never met anyone else who treats their attic like a bank vault. Sometimes you talk about it like they’ve got Jesus Christ himself up here.”

Jonah follows after Bobby and finds him in the dark at the end of the hall. Tracing something in a patch of rust flakes with the tip of his shoe.

“Or, and hear me out,” Bobby says over his shoulder, “it’s a nasty ass sex dungeon.”

“Would you please shut the hell up?”

“I bet they’ve got a swing up there and everything and I wanna see that shit.”

“There’s something wrong with you. Like, in your genes I think. If that’s your best theory I can guarantee you’ll be disappointed,” Jonah prays to every god he can think of for that to be true. “Lately I’m thinking there might be some kind of collectibles? Mom’s into that stuff, she probably keeps the valuable ones up there.”

“And I wanna see that too. She might have some sick pokemon cards.”

“We might be able to find out if you’d finish whatever the hell you’re doing.”

Bobby twirls around with a wild grin and puts out both his arms to frame a far too detailed rendition of a dick, like a magician showing off his freshly bisected assistant.

Jonah levels a withering gaze at him. “That took you the entire conversation?”

Bobby puts on a hurt look. “You wound me good sir. Art takes time, and this is my magnum opus.”

“Might wanna hold off on applying to art schools bud.”

“Everyone’s a critic.” Bobby rolls his eyes before turning and scampering up into the attic.

“Holy shit!” he yells as his feet disappear through the trapdoor. “I can’t believe it man, this is so…”

Jonah’s heart skips a beat and he flies up the ladder.

“...Boring,” Bobby finishes as Jonah bursts into the room. He doubles over in the corner and cackles when Jonah can’t stop his face from falling.

Fluffy pink fiberglass lines the walls of the cramped space. Wooden slats poke through like ribs. A heavyset bookshelf sits across from Jonah. A needle of daylight cuts across its waist, slicing in through a little window to the left. Heaps of cobwebbed boxes with labels like ‘clothes to donate,’ and ‘ski gear,’ are littered across the floor. And a faint chemical scent hangs in the air, like being in a hospital.

“Oh your face man, it was priceless,” Bobby says, wiping away tears. Jonah flips him off as he turns to look around, which only makes Bobby laugh harder.

Behind Jonah, a metal table the length of the room is stacked with plastic tubs, film reels, white bottles stamped with chemical warning symbols, and other strange equipment. He looks up and scans the ceiling. No lightbulbs.

“The light was yellow,” he mutters.

“What’s up?” Bobby asks as he closes a box of christmas ornaments.

“No way they’d keep a bunch of random crap locked up so tight.” Jonah walks to the shelf and pulls a book off, starts to flip through its musty pages. “We’ve gotta be missing something.”

“Missing what? There’s nothing here but junk.”

“I don’t know dude, just, look around.”

“Alright, I guess,” Bobby breathes out an exaggerated sigh. He snatches a baseball bat out of a box and takes a couple practice swings.

The discolored spines on the bookshelf are a mishmash of true crime, criminal law textbooks, others like ‘Fundamentals of Anatomy and Physiology,’ and ‘Beginner’s Guide to Gardening.’ All of them are worn and caked in a heavy layer of dust.

“Jonah, hey,” Bobby’s on his knees by the side of the shelf. “The floor’s all scratched up here. I think someone’s been moving this thing” his eyes turn to Jonah, the shelf, then back. “Y’think… should we try it?” Bobby asks.

But Jonah knows there’s nothing back there. Can’t be. The scratches are from mice or, or maybe they used to keep furniture up here? That’s all it is. So why is this queasy feeling creeping up on him? All he has to do is peek behind the shelf, put his mind at ease. This’ll be a funny story he laughs with his parents about after he moves out.

He nods to Bobby and leans his shoulder against the side of the shelf. It shifts forward as they throw their weight into it, just far enough for them to fit through the slit of tarry darkness in the wall behind it.

“Flashlight,” Jonah whispers. Bobby fumbles his phone out of his pocket, nearly drops it before he manages to get the light on. The darkness retreats to the walls like a swarm of roaches as they squeeze into the hidden room.

The space is cramped and dingy. Dust motes filter through the beam cast by Bobby’s phone. A thin chain hangs from the middle of the ceiling, swaying slightly. A small filing cabinet squats against the opposite wall. Dainty footprints lead to it, pressed into the carpet of dust.

“The fuck is this,” Bobby says under his breath. His face is milk-pale. Jonah shoves past him and pulls the hanging chain. It bobs drunkenly as a fluorescent tube in the ceiling buzzes to life, like it was crammed with sleeping flies, and floods the room with that yellow light. A sinkhole is opening in Jonah’s stomach, his guts are in freefall. He kneels before the filing cabinet and eases open the bottom drawer. Bobby’s hot breath washes across the back of his neck as they both lean in to look.

Inside is a bundle of paracord, a polaroid camera, two jugs of bleach, a snaggletoothed wire brush, a foldable shovel, boxes and boxes of disposable rubber gloves. A black rubber handle sticks out of the mess like an exclamation mark. Jonah’s hand is on it before his brain can catch up. He pulls free a claw hammer. The head is crusted in mottled brown that’s starting to flake and peel. Jonah drops it back onto the pile and recoils, nearly knocking Bobby over. His breath is in a dead sprint.

“This is fucked,” Bobby’s face glistens with nervous sweat.

“Shut up,” Jonah hisses.

“I know what this is man. I watch TV.”

“They didn’t know,” Jonah’s eyes won’t leave the hammer, “no way. They would’ve told somebody.”

“Of course they know,” Bobby’s got frog eyes, bulging, darting between Jonah and the door. “They had–”

“No!” Jonah wheels on him. Bobby flinches and shrinks away. “You joke around with my dad all the time,” Jonah’s voice verges on a pleading whine. “My mom gets you a birthday present every, single, year. You can’t think they’d have anything to do with this. You can’t.”

Bobby’s eyes sink to his shoes. “Yeah. Okay, man. Sorry.”

“There’s something here that’ll prove it.”

“Alright, just… let’s hurry.”

Jonah opens the other drawer. His face screws up as a wave of sweet stench spills out, like sour milk and rotten fruit. The little drawer is stuffed with manila file folders. A year is written on the tab of each one in familiar, feminine script that Jonah refuses to recognize. He grabs one from the middle. It’s dated 2001. A couple plastic baggies and what look like polaroids lie in its belly. Jonah pulls out a baggie for a closer look.

It takes him a second to realize what he’s holding. Bile burns the back of his throat when he does. Behind the clear plastic is a set of human fingernails. The ends are cracked, bent into torturous angles. Scraps of desiccated of skin still cling to the cuticles. Jonah chucks the folder across the room with a strangled yelp. It hits the wall and explodes. Showering the room with macabre confetti. Locks of hair swirl through the air. Teeth and bits of yellowed bone clatter across the floor. But nothing is worse than the polaroids. Each one is a broken human being. One man’s fingertips are red and frayed, a pair of bloody pliers lies next to him in the dirt. Others have no teeth. Their mouths are yawning red caverns all screaming at Jonah to save them.

Bobby’s saying something. Jonah can’t hear him over the radio static roiling in his head. He’s already back at the cabinet. Bobby’s hand falls on his shoulder and Jonah shrugs it away. Each folder is just as grotesque as the first. Body parts paired with polaroids. A chest of souls. The contents thin out as the dates progress. Jonah’s hands shake when he gets to the most recent, the current year. There’s one polaroid inside. He grabs it. Time stops.

Dan Wolfe is laid out on the side of the road. The black handle of the claw hammer sticks out of his eggshell skull. Scalp hangs ragged around the crater. Blood and bits of gray matter ooze into the grass.

“Bobby…” Jonah’s voice is a low moan.

Bobby’s hand grabs him again and Jonah doesn’t fight as he’s hauled to his feet.

“We gotta go, right now,” Bobby’s voice holds together at the seams as he drags him out through the bookshelf door. “Gotta tell the cops about this. If it wasn’t your parents they can find out but we can’t be touching this shit.”

The groan of the front door opening floats into the attic. Bobby goes rigid.

“Fuck,” any hint of color drains from his face, “fuck fuck fuck what do we do?”

“Hello?” Jonah’s mom calls.

Jonah’s mind is sluggish. Shell shocked. He can’t breathe. Terror has two hands wrapped around his throat. But the light from the window shines through the haze in his head.

“The window,” he says in a vacant monotone. “We can get out. When I come back I’ll tell them we ran off. That we weren’t here, it wasn’t us, someone broke in. They’ll believe me. They will. I’ll talk to them. There has to be a reasonable explanation.”

“A reasonable explanation? There’s a whole fuckin’ morgue up here and you want a reasonable explanation?”

His mom’s light footsteps search through the living room. *Tap*. *Tap*. *Tap*. It’s a ticking clock. Getting louder, closer.

“L–Let’s just get out of here,” Jonah says.

“Finally, something we agree on.”

They creep to the window. Jonah eases it open and pokes his head outside. The sky is bruised yellow and restless. The air smells burnt, like lightning.

Jonah wriggles onto the roof. The second he does, the footsteps from downstairs stop. Right at the entrance to the hall.

Bobby lunges for the window as Jonah’s mom bolts into the kitchen. Jonah reaches, grabs his hand and pulls, but Bobby’s too big to fit through.

“Come on man you gotta help me.” Tears spring in the corners his eyes.

Jonah’s mom doubles back. Machine gun steps rattle down the hall. She’s at the ladder.

“Shit, just, go hide,” and Jonah shoves Bobby back into the attic. He looks like he’s just seen his own intestines spill out. “Go!” Jonah urges. “We don’t have time. You’ll be fine, I promise.”

Bobby shoots him a terrified, wounded look before diving into the mountains of boxes.

The narrow face of Jonah’s mom rises through the trapdoor. Her bright blue eyes are icicles. They land on a tennis shoe sticking out from a mound of boxes and narrow to reptilian slits.

She slips into the attic without a sound, a jungle cat in a floral print blouse, and slides a long kitchen knife from her waistband. It gleams as she stalks toward the boxes.

The sinkhole hollowing Jonah’s stomach is now spewing churning, superheated dread. He has to do something. But his mouth won’t move. His arms won’t move. His legs won’t move. Why, god, why can’t he *move*?

His mom darts forward and jabs the knife through a gap in the cardboard. When she pulls it back it’s painted red. Bobby erupts out of the boxes. He screams and screams and screams. It doesn’t end. Even as she snatches a fistful of his hair and drags him to the middle of the room. His legs kick weakly. One hand is clamped over his stomach, the other clutches his phone. She tosses him to the floor like a sack of trash. A mask of snot and tears covers his face. Blood pours through his fingers as he tries to hold it in while the other hand taps feebly at a bright green call button. But he’s shaking too hard and it keeps missing.

She stomps the heel of her boot into Bobby’s wrist until he drops the phone. Then she stomps the screen into glittery dust. Her face is blank and bored as she crouches in front of him.

“Where is Jonah?”

“Please please don’t hurt me I’ll do anything.”

Her head cocks slightly “Why would I do that? I like you Bobby. You know that, right?” He nods in a violent burst of motion, and she puts on a smile. “Good. So tell me where Jonah is and I’ll forget that you broke into my house and attacked me. I was barely able to fend you off.”

“It hurts oh god it hurts,” his words are mangled by sobs.

“Molly!” Jonah’s dad shouts from downstairs. “Molly what the fuck is going on up there?”

“I’ll never tell anyone I promise. Nobody will ever know I swear to god just let me go I don’t wanna die.”

Molly sighs, exasperated. She kneads her knuckles into her forehead, then beats them against it with a low growl. Then she buries the knife in Bobby’s newborn adam’s apple. His sobs choke on metal. Now just a gurgling cough and a steady stream of blood. It coats his chin and his neck and his chest. He keeps reaching for the knife, but he can never quite bring himself to grab it. He tries to flip himself over, to look at Jonah one last time, but the window is empty. Then the life in Bobby’s eyes drains out through the hole in his throat and his chin thuds on the floor.

Jonah’s dad appears in the trapdoor. “The hell are you doing…” he trails off once he sees Bobby. 

“I told you to wait in the car.”

“What did you do?” his face is gray stone, his voice a grinding whisper. “You know who that is, right?”

Molly snorts. “Oh go to hell, Tim. You think I don’t recognize Jonah’s only friend?”

He closes the gap between them instantly, “Then why the fuck is he lying there dead!”

She jabs a finger into his chest, “keep your voice down.” Her voice is low and measured.

Tim closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. His fists tighten at his sides. “Why did you do this. We said we were done.”

“He saw everything.” Molly shrugs. “I did the same thing you would have.”

“You could have called me up here. We could have talked to him.”

Molly’s laugh is a sharp bark. “I tried. He was going to tell.”

“You don’t know that! But it’s always impulse first with you, isn’t it?”

“Get off your high horse, Tim. Why didn’t you try to talk with Dan before you bashed his brains in?”

Dark clouds form over Tim’s eyes. “I did try to talk with Dan. He laughed in my face when I told him what Jacob had been doing to Jonah.”

“So you protected our family. Same as I did.”

Tim looms over Molly. His lips curl into a snarl. She’s unfazed. After a few long seconds he deflates. Molly grins. Tim’s face is hollow.

“Where’s Jonah?” he asks.

“Bobby wouldn’t say, but he wouldn’t have broken in on his own. I’ll clean this up, you find him. And keep him here. We can’t let him out of sight until we’re able to explain this somehow. For his own sake.”

Tim nods. The ladder screeches as he descends. 

Molly stares at Bobby’s corpse. And keeps staring. She opens her mouth, as if she’s about to scold him, then her lips press into a thin, trembling line. Her eyes snap shut. She balls her fists and starts to take huge, rapid fire breaths. Faster, faster, faster until she’s nearly hyperventilating. Then it crescendos in one long exhale. A shiver runs down her spine. She opens her eyes.

She hums and old lullaby as she works. The melody carries out to the roof and makes Jonah’s eyes sting. His back is pressed to the wall next to the window. His knees are hugged tight to his chest. He scrambled into hiding as soon as Bobby got stabbed in the throat. Couldn’t bring himself to watch. But the screams, they loop and loop and loop inside his head. Stuck in that endless moment.

The wet *shlurp* of the knife being pulled from its fleshy sheath makes Jonah’s stomach heave. The sudden nausea jump-starts his brain. He crawls to the edge of the roof and vomits as quietly as he can into the flowerbeds below. When he’s done, he sits back. The block he grew up on sprawls below him. Domino rows of pastel houses. The sweet smell of freshly mown grass. Fat black storm clouds advance across the sky, pulling the light off it all like pretty wrapping paper. When he was in fifth grade some older kid broke his arm. A few weeks later the kid disappeared. Jonah’s dad said he’d been sent to military school. And what happened to that babysitter who left him on his own to go party? He never saw her again. How many of those polaroids would he recognize if he could bring himself to look?

His mom’s humming serrates the air. The overwhelming urge to leave crashes into him. To lower himself down to the flowerbeds and run, run as far as possible.

Run where? He’s got no other family, no other friends. Nothing. Tears beat at the backs of his eyes. This is all his fault. Bobby’s dead. Turned to meat. He could have stopped her. Why didn’t he stop her? He sinks his teeth into his hand to keep from sobbing. ‘You’ve got a big heart, Jonah.’ His whole life is a lie. He hates them. How could they do this to him? He still hears Bobby screaming. Even as she cuts away at his corpse. They were supposed to love him. They did love him, he knows it. He’s panting through his balled fist now. Practically hyperventilating. He wants to make them hurt. Just like they did to him. To Bobby.

Jonah crawls back to the window. His mom’s gone. All that’s left of Bobby is a red smear on the floor leading behind the bookshelf. Jonah inches the window open and slips back inside. His heart is galloping. Every nerve is a crackling live wire. He grabs the baseball bat and cocks it over his shoulder. Taking up a position right to the hidden door.

Inside, Molly’s laying out a tarp, rolling Bobby onto it. The bloody knife makes her scowl. It won’t be enough to get through the bones. She’ll need the cleaver. She cleaned it so well after Dan, too. Oh well, that’s life. Bobby’s mouth burbles as she wipes her hands clean on his shorts. Then she stands, and leaves the room.

The instant she appears Jonah launches the bat at her head. Snarling as it rips through the air. Time slows. The two of them lock eyes and shock crosses his mom’s face for a millisecond. Then all Jonah sees is sadness.

Impact. *Crunch*, like dead leaves. Her head snaps back into the doorframe. Her limbs turn to jelly and she ragdolls, crumples into a heap. Her nose is crushed flat against her face. Her front teeth are gravel on her lolling tongue.

Jonah jerks his eyes away. The bat clatters to the floor. She isn’t breathing. That’s not his mom. But she’s going to die. Die just like Bobby. She’s already dead. And she deserved it. He didn’t have a choice. He just wants her back. Wants to wake up from this nightmare. That’s not, his mom.

Her lungs sputter to life. Jonah can’t stop a brief smile. It makes him angry. He forces his lips into a grimace as he turns away from her. His dad’s heavy footsteps patrol the house below. Jonah waits for him to move to the kitchen, then jumps through the trapdoor. He hits the floor in a sprint. The family photos on the walls have mangled noses, toothless mouths. Three strides and he’s in his room. Footsteps pound after him but he’s got a few seconds. He grabs his phone, and the Swiss army knife lying next to it, then turns toward the window. Just a couple more steps.

“Jonah…” His dad’s reflection is in the glass. The doorframe is filled with his bulk. Jonah turns to face him. Unfolding the knife behind his back.

“Jonah, let’s talk about this.” He steps closer, eyes fixed on Jonah like he’s corralling some escaped animal.

“Are you gonna kill me too?”

“Never,” his dad looks horrified. “You have to know that, Jonah. We love you so, so much.”

“Then why?” Jonah can’t stop the cracks from spreading in his voice. “Why are you doing this?”

“For you, Jonah. It’s always been for you,” he nudges his foot forward. “Your mom and I never had this growing up,” he gestures around at Jonah’s room. “The only things our parents loved were drugs and booze. Your mom had it the worst. Her dad… He got handsy when he drank.” He takes another step. Jonah inches back.  “We had to do awful things to get out of that place. And even when we did we were lost for a long, long time. Until you came along,” he flashes Jonah that warm smile he knows so well. “Our little miracle. And we knew we had to be better.” Jonah takes another step back. His dad matches it. Not letting him grow the distance. “We had to stop. To give you a good, normal life. The kind we were never able to have. And we did so well for so long. But we could never quite let it go. I think deep down we always knew,” his smile morphs into a snarl. “People can’t sit by while someone else is happy. They take and they take and they take until they’ve picked your bones clean. The scum we put in that box, trust me Jonah they deserved to rot in there.” Jonah’s back hits the window. His dad clears his throat, plasters on a new smile. His slow advance doesn’t stop. “We had to protect you. So the world wouldn’t make you like us. So you’d be happy,” his voice turn insistent, begging Jonah to understand.

“What about Bobby?” Jonah’s voice is hoarse and small.

His dad’s eyes wobble. He stares at his shoes. “I’m sorry. Bobby was a good kid, I know how much you liked him. But he would have told people. We would have lost you.”

Jonah stares in disbelief, at the creature wearing his dad’s skin. He doesn’t even recognize him. His smile is stretched too wide. His eyes jitter with crazy energy.

“I hate you,” Jonah’s voice is blank. Leached of emotion.

“No, you can’t mean that.” His dad’s getting closer with every step. Tears stream down his face and soak into his beard. He gestures to his chest with both hands, “you know me. Lets talk about this. All three of us,” he motions back toward the door.

Jonah lunges forward with a feral scream. He rams the pocket knife into his dad’s leg, right above the knee. The blade shears through tendons and veins. Shockwaves shudder up Jonah’s arm as the hilt slams into bone.

His dad bellows as he topples. His head hits the hardwood, ricochets, and slams down again. Jonah flings the window open. A hand grabs at his pant leg. He wrenches free, dives outside and runs as heartbroken howls fade behind him.



\*\*\*



The police find Jonah two blocks over, hunched in a stranger’s bushes, his phone still connected to 911. They ask him to point out which house he came from. Storm clouds gather to enjoy the show as a procession of wailing squad cars marches to the scene of the crime.

Jonah grinds his forehead against the cold glass of the car window. Watching swarms of termites in blue uniforms filing in and out of his house through heavy curtains of rain. The cops shuttle a steady stream of evidence bags filled with polaroids and shriveled pieces of people out into an evidence van. As well as his parents’ shoes, their toothbrushes, their clothes, their cameras, dustings of the their fingerprints, pieces of their hair. Would there be anything left, if he ever got to go back?

The officer in the driver’s seat is taking notes on her clipboard and clogging the air with the stench of her cheap, oily perfume. There’s no escaping it. So Jonah stares through the small crack running down the glass and listens to her pencil scrape paper. Until the police march his parents out into the rain.

His mom’s nose is smashed flat against her face. His dad’s got a bandage around his knee and a crutch to hobble on. Both of them are weighed down by shackles. Shoulders sagging like waterlogged scarecrows as they’re line up against the side of the van.

“Alright Jonah, I’m gonna bring you down to the station to answer a few questions then we’ll get you situated. You did a good thing here, kid.”

Jonah can’t hear her. She’s a background buzz. Rain drums on the outside of the car. His dad smiles at him under guilt soaked eyes. His mom breaks away, she makes it a few steps towards him before an officer drags her back. They both yell how much they love him. How sorry they are. His mom’s sobbing so hard she can’t get anything else out before the paramedics load her into an ambulance. “Be good son,” his dad mouths.

Then Jonah’s car pulls away. Tears stream down his cheeks as his life is swallowed up by the rain.
