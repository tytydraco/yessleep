The weather has a slight chill to it, the trees are now adorned with leaves red and amber hues, houses display decorations of skeletons and carved pumpkins, it is the fall season. I arrive to the post office; I worked as a Mail Carrier in New York City, but with the costs of living getting more and more ridiculous it was the smarter choice to move to a cheaper place. Hibernia is a small village that used to be a prosperous mining community in the past, of course in today's date there is no working mine and now the village whose population was in the thousands now sits about a hundred. Now you might be thinking, “This guy went from New York City to this ghost of a town?”; If that was your thought, trust me I get you, but you can't beat a nice cheap place to live and if I miss the city, its only an hour and some minutes drive to get there.

The post office in comparison to the one in the city is like putting a shed and a Amazon warehouse side by side; clearly the one here in Hibernia is very small. We are about 4 Mail Carriers in the whole town, me being the newest. As I clocked in I was approached by Wilkins; he is the mail carrier tasked with giving me instructions since this is my first day working at Hibernia.

**Wilkins:** “Vazquez, right?”

I should have probably mentioned this in the beginning, My name is Jason Vasquez and in the post office people refer to us by our last names.

**Vasquez:** “Yep, that's me.. Wilkins, right?”

Wilkins nods and gestures me to go to the table where my route is being set up for the day. I approached it and scanned around the table noticing how much smaller the routes are here compared to New York City.

**Wilkins:** “So this is where you will be working.. As you see its not too many roads. You got about five of them, I can even tell you the exact number of houses!”

**Vasquez:** “Is this right? I'm supposed to be out there for 8 hours... This feels like something I can get done in 2 hours tops.”

Wilkins let out a chuckle and pats me on the back while nodding at my confusion.

**Wilkins:** “True, but the upside of working in such a small town is that even if you finish early they are gonna clock you out for 8 hours.”

Wilkins shrugs

**Wilkins:** “Don't know if that's standard procedure or if our Post Master is risking his job by showing kindness to us, but we get our full hours regardless.”

Wilkins grabs a small stack of yellow slips that are used to instruct a mail carrier about specific houses of businesses. He pulls one slip out thats labeled for my route.

**Wilkins:** “Your route is pretty straightforward.. The only thing to note is there is a Vacant abandoned house around Snake Hill road.. You can just skip that house as you deliver the mail.”

**Vasquez:** “Alright, will do.”

I take the slip from Wilkins that has the address of that abandoned house to remind myself I can skip the house and I start organizing my letters for the day. Wilkins sees that I am experienced in prepping for the day so he nods confident that I can do the job and walks away to tend to his other responsibilities. An hour passes and I am ready to begin my day delivering mail. Everything is loaded into my little mail truck and I head out on my way to my first stop.

The day is going as Wilkins said it was be; straightforward. With not much work left I approach my last street; Snake Hill Road. As I walk down the road I realized how it lives up to its name, The narrow, winding street snaking through the dense fall colored woods of Hibernia. The air is thick with the earthly scent of pine trees and damp leaves and the only sounds emanate from this area are the occasional rustle of wildlife and the crunch of leaves under my shoes. The houses are few and far between, each one set back from the road, hidden by thick trees or perched on small, uneven hills.

As I continue my deliveries, one house in particular catches my eye. This is the one mentioned in the yellow slip Wilkins handed to me. Unlike the other houses, this one stands alone, abandoned and decaying. Its windows are dark, the glass cracked or missing, and the paint on the wooden siding is peeling away like dead skin. The roof seems to sag in the middle, and the front porch leans precariously as if it might collapse under the weight of a single step. Weeds and vines have overtaken the yard, creeping up the walls and choking the remnants of a broken-down fence. The front door is splintered and in the middle lies what seems to be a rusted mail slot that seemed it hasn't even been touched in centuries.

**Vasquez:** “This is definitely the abandoned house...”

Wilkins stated that I can skip this house since there is never mail going to it and frankly there wont be any outgoing mail to get from it. While crossing by the property, a sudden cold breeze blows though the trees, but this breeze seems to carry a sense of unease. The air feels heavier here, as I stare at the abandoned house I get the feeling that its very presence holds memories of the past, secrets buried beneath layers of time. What was more apparent was the sudden lack of noise; There is a quiet stillness that makes my skin crawl, a feeling that you're being watched, but I know for certain the house is empty. I shake off this strange feeling and eagerly decide to walk away to continue my duties.

After that day, I continued in that same route. Once I arrive at Snake Hill Road I skip the abandoned house without much thought. Weeks go by with no issue.

But today, something was different.

As I drove past the house, a small movement caught my eye. I slowed the truck, squinting through the fading light. There, hanging out the rusty mail slot in the front door, was a letter. I can feel my brow furrowing. To my knowledge, the house has been deserted for many years and naturally, no one even sent or received mail there. Yet, this letter was clearly outgoing, the corner of the envelope flapping slightly in the breeze.

Curiosity mixed with an uneasy feeling settle in my gut, I paused for a minute to get my thoughts in order but the conclusion is clear; duty is duty. I pulled the truck to the side of the road and hesitated for a moment before reluctantly stepping out. The gravel and fallen leaves crunch under my shoes as I walked towards the house, each step sounding more and more loud as if the surrounding sounds of nature are now out of reach.

I reach the front of the house carefully stepping on the decaying wooden patio creaking noises as I climb its steps. I reach the front door, it is as it always is a splintered wooden door with a rusted mailbox in the middle about chest high. With trembling fingers, I gently tugged the letter free. The envelope looks old, yellowed with age, the most strange thing is the writing. The address seems to be written in a shaky, almost childlike scrawl. There was no stamp, only a name that can't be made out.

**Vasquez:** “This is strange...”

The return address seems to had long since faded into illegibility. Clearly this letter has been hanging there forever, but why did I notice it now? I shrugged and took the letter with me. But then something happened..

As I turned to head back to the truck, the unusual cold breeze I felt the first time returns, then, a creaking sound froze me in my tracks. The unmistakable groan of the mail slot swinging open echoed in the quiet, dead air. My heart is pounding in my chest, my breath hitched. I stood still, every nerve in my body screaming at me to run, but something else is seemingly urging me to turn around.

Then, a soft, unnatural sound broke the silence; a chattering noise, like someone clumsily mimicking the call of a cat. It was low and throaty, rising and falling in a way that sent a cold shiver down my spine.

Fear Paralyzed me, I knew something was watching me from the open slot. Something that shouldn't be there. My mind started racing, imagining eyes; pale, hollow and hungry, peering at me from the darkness within the house.

**Vasquez:** “Don't look back...”

I whispered this to myself, my voice barely more than a breath.

After a few moments I managed to summon all my strength and dashed forward, not daring to glance behind. I leaped into the truck, slamming the door shut, my hands trembling as I fumbled to start the engine. When I finally did, I couldn't resist the urge to check.

I looked back

The mail slot was closed, the door as silent as it had been when I first arrived. Nothing was there. I threw the truck into gear and sped away, the letter now resting on the passenger seat like a heavy weight. As I glanced at it again, a cold realization washed over me.

**Vasquez:** “Vasquez... The name on the letter... its my name!”

I stopped the truck, with Shaky hands I tore opened the old envelope, and out slid a stack of old, faded Polaroid photos. My breath caught in my throat as I spread out the photos in my lap. The images were grainy and worn, but what was unmistakable was the subject:

**Vasquez:** “That's... That's me...?”

It was indeed me. The photos captured me as I walked across the property, each one taken from different angles, all seemingly from inside the house. In one photo it showed me standing looking at the house, this image must have been taken from the first day I delivered in that street.

The last photo was the one that made my blood run cold.

The photo was taken of me reaching the abandoned house to grab the letter. I can't even begin to explain how the hell, a photo of that very moment was taken and put in the enveloped as I was grabbing it. But what was truly terrifying was the angle. It was taken from inside my mail truck looking towards the house, and in the windows slightly obscured by tattered curtains, a figure is standing there, a figure that I know for sure wasn't there when I approached the house.

There I knew... Deep down inside, that whatever was in that house was not done with me yet...
