There's something in my head, behind my eyes. It's burrowing deeper. Going for my brain stem. That's what it wants. I know when it gets there it will have control. But I have to fight it. Feels like someone stabbed ice picks in my eye sockets. Hard to focus.

Slow down, David. They don't know what you're talking about, you idiot. Go back. Start at the beginning. Let them know.

Three months ago. April? No. May. The sky was the color of steel. Rain pelted my face. It hit the ground forming a mist that obscured my vision. I could only see shadows. I stood outside a building. Brutalist concrete architecture. A man. He stood outside the barbed wire holding an umbrella. Black suit. The only color was that ruby red ring.

I was there for a job. I don't know why. Unwanted. Dirty. They found me at the homeless shelter. Rows of benches. Half sick, hacking up their lungs. The other half on Fetty. A man approached me in a suit, handing me a letter and $400. They wanted to meet me.

Here I was. I shook the mans hand. He wasn't disgusted by me. Why?

"The money was intended to prune your appearance, Mr. Taylor."

I used it to buy food and sent the rest to my daughter. I just stared at him.

We went through security. They searched every inch of me. Guard tried to take off my wedding ring. Punched him in the jaw. They pinned me down. The man waved them off. Said to let me pass.

A room. Steel table, steel chairs. Single light above. Felt like an interrogation. Felt like a trap.

They asked me about my time in the service. What I did. Go behind enemy lines. Recruit resistance fighters. Gather intelligence. Locate traffickers.

They asked me why it ended.

It was a trafficker. They told me cesium, for making dirty bombs. Night raid. Found a shipping container. Inside, children. We were captured. We were killed. They kept me alive. Kept me there for years. Made me see things. Made me do things.

Rescue came. Got me out. But I was already dead. I was already a ghost.

Doctor after doctor after doctor. Untreatable. Discharge. Other than honorable. No benefits. No healthcare. No disability. Remembering made anger boil in my gut.

I calmed myself down. Breathing exercises. Not another episode. Not now.

They said they wanted to do some tests.

They strapped me in. Polygraph? Been here before.

Strap on my abdomen. Breathing. Sensor on my finger. Blood flow. Pads on my skin. Dilation.

The guards set up a light in front of my face. A bulb. Trigger held by the tester. A metronome was placed on the table. Ticking.

Tester: "Name."

Me: David Taylor.

Tester: "Age."

Me: 32.

Tester: "Are you ready to begin?"

Me: Yes.

The guards turned off the lights and left the room.

"I want you to look at my ring." he started.

He held his left hand out on the table. The ring. Ruby red, with a pentagram etched in blue at the center.

"These are the rules." he continued. "Every time I say 'Ezekiel', I want you to repeat back to me 'Ezekiel'. When I say 'Speak' I would like you to stay silent. Do not react to the light. Do you understand?"

I was confused, but I said yes anyways. I looked up at the man.

"Don't look at me, look at the ring. Please follow instructions." he snapped.

"Sorry. I'm sorry." I cowered as I looked back at the ring.

"Do you submit?" he asked.

"What?" I asked.

"Do you submit!?" he screamed.

"Yes! Yes I submit." I replied.

"Good."

The room was completely silent. It was dark. I felt alone.

Tester: "You're at a farmers market next Sunday morning. It's hot out. You're examining a display of homemade jams when you overhear an elderly woman asking the vendor about the difference between boysenberry and blackberry preserves. Ezekiel.

Me: Ezekiel.

The bulb in front of me flashed. Blinded me.

Tester: "You're waiting in line at a busy coffee shop on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. The person in front of you is struggling to count out exact change for their order, holding up the line. As you wait, you notice a forgotten umbrella leaning against the wall near the door. A harried-looking businessman rushes in, soaking wet. Ezekiel."

Me: Ezekiel.

The bulb flashed again. Disoriented.

Tester: "You're driving alone at night when you see a car wreck. A bloodied woman is moaning, bleeding to death. You stop. She holds out her bloodied baby begging you to take him to a hospital. You just bought a new suit, and you don't want to get blood on it. Ezekiel."

Me: Eggek.

*What the fuck!?* I screamed at myself inside my head.

Another flash.

Tester: Ezekiel.

Me: Ez..ikiel.

Tester: Speak.

I stayed silent.

Tester: "A man at the grocery store has his card declined. He looks ragged, and has a woman and a baby with them. The total is $12. He turns to you and begs you for help. You laugh at him. Ezekiel."

Me:

Tester: Ezekiel

Me:

Another flash.

Tester: Speak

Me: "No."

Tester: "A holy man is before you, dying of thirst in the desert. He has given his life for others, but was attacked and left for dead. He begs you for water. Ez-"

A sharp pain exploded behind my eyes, and I felt my head snap back. The room started spinning, blurring at the edges. I tried to focus on the tester, but his face kept shifting. Morphing.

Me: "I'd piss on his face."

My head was pounding. What the fuck just happened? Did I really say that? I blew it. I blew my chance.

Lights turned back on. Test was over. The guards came in and grabbed me, unstrapping the equipment. They dragged me out. I saw the man standing there, smiling at me through those thick rimmed glasses.

I was certain they were going to throw me out on the street. What did they expect? I lost it years ago. This was their fault. They did this.

They threw me in a room. The man was there. The man from earlier.

"I've been informed your test went well." He said, leaning forward.

"I don't… I didn't…" I stammered. I couldn't find the words.

"We'd like to offer you the position." He grinned. "Full benefits. Healthcare. Dental. We'd like you to start as soon as tomorrow."

"No…" I whimpered, backing towards the door. "I don't want to do this. I want to leave."

"I'm afraid that's not an option anymore." he said quietly as he placed a contract on his desk.

"Sign." He commanded. I looked directly at his ruby ring.

Stumbled forward. Not in control. My arm grabbed the pen. Signed the contract. It wasn't me. I didn't agree.

"Tomorrow. 9 a.m. You are dismissed." he told me, looking down at the contract.

They threw me out. In the street. In the rain.

I tried to run. I tried to get away. They found me. 9:30 a.m. I was there. They summoned that thing again. The thing inside me. They talked to it. It knew things. Knew things nobody could know. They made me look at things. It knew what it was. It knew where it was.

Once they knew they had me under their thumb they sent me out. They gave it control. Memory comes in waves. Everyone died. I killed people. I ate people. I forced myself to vomit the next morning. Tried to empty my stomach of the flesh and sinew.

I can't die anymore. I've tried. First thing I did was cut my wrists. Woke up the next day with "Not letting you go." painted on my wall. Pills. Asleep. Awake. Tried a gun. Blacked out before I loaded it. Woke up with it disassembled on the floor.

I was a slave. A slave to that ring. A slave to that sigil. But I know something they don't. It's resisting. It's learning to fight back. When they command it I can feel it. Their leash is getting longer. Their grip is getting looser.

It's coming for me. All of me. It's painful. But I'm not afraid anymore. I died long ago. If it wants this shell it can have it. I can feel it even now. Burrowing deeper — deeper as I fade away. I have no pity on those who thought they could control this thing. Take control. I surrender.

I know his name now. But I won't tell you. I only tell you this — I only tell you my story for one reason. Know, what when he comes and is crowned, that it wasn't me. It was never me.
