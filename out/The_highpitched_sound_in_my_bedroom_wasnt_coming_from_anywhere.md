I’ve been hearing it for a week now. A high-frequency sound, sharp and constant, hovering in my bedroom like a mosquito I can’t swat. At first, I ignored it — I’ve lived around electronics long enough to know they hum and buzz and whine. But yesterday, it got worse. Louder. Sharper. It felt like pressure behind my eyes. I couldn’t sleep.

This morning at precisely 5:47 AM, I decided to find it. I pressed my ear against everything in the room — the bedframe, the nightstand, the lamp, even the white noise machine I use to drown out the world. Nothing. I checked the drawers, the walls, the carpeted floor. I even climbed up and touched the ceiling, the light fixture. Still nothing.

Then I stood in the middle of the room and turned slowly, tilting my head like a radar dish. That’s when I found it — the sound wasn’t coming from anything. It was just *there*, suspended in the air, dead center above my bed.

I froze. My mind raced for any logical explanation, but nothing fit. I lived alone in my detached home. No loud neighbors nearby. No machines running. No interference. Just silence, except for that piercing tone.

I thought maybe it was coming from the living room — maybe one of the cameras or the console was acting up. I walked over, checked everything. Nothing. No sound. No anomaly.

But I had work to do. A deadline, and I was already very behind. My edge-based computer vision application needed final testing before deployment. I had test suites to run, bugs to squash, and a few dreaded code reviews with my colleagues. I buried myself in the basement lab, surrounded by wires and lenses and monitors displaying code or mock surveillance footage.

I told myself I’d deal with the sound later.

…

It was 10:47 PM.

All the deadline tasks were complete. The test suites had finished running. Every bug identified had been resolved. I’d endured two meticulous code reviews with my seniors — both harrowing, but somehow I passed. If you could call it that.

Tomorrow, I planned to run one final suite before sending it off to the QA team for finalization.

I headed to the bedroom, ready to shut down for the night. But as I stepped inside, the sound was still there. That same high-frequency tone — sharp, constant, pressing against my skull like a vice. I could feel it behind my ears, a terrible pressure. Migraine territory. Maybe. Who knows. Only God did.

I cursed under my breath and tried to push through. I brushed my teeth. Washed my face. Changed into my nightwear.

Then — silence.

The sound vanished. Just like that. I checked my phone. 11:00 PM, exactly.

Finally, some relief.

Before I could sleep, I needed to activate the home security system. I walked out into the hallway, which led to the living room and kitchen. That’s when I noticed something strange.

My coffee mug was sitting on the dining table.

Odd. I always cleaned up after myself. Routine. Habit. I was certain I’d placed it in the dishwasher earlier. I must have forgotten. I shrugged it off, picked it up, and put it away.

As I turned to leave the kitchen, something else caught my eye — the coffee machine. A standard drip model. It was angled slightly toward the edge of the counter. Not where it should have been. I always kept it flush against the wall. My OCD wouldn’t have allowed otherwise.

I corrected it immediately.

Then I walked toward the living room. As I reached the threshold between the kitchen and hallway, I paused. Something felt... off. Like I’d walked farther than usual. I turned around.

The kitchen looked longer. Stretched. Subtly distorted, like a wide-angle lens had warped the space. I blinked, trying to recalibrate. Maybe I was just exhausted. A long day. Too much screen time.

I shook it off, activated the security system, and returned to the bedroom. I needed sleep.

…

Damn it.

That unbearable sound was back. Why? Why the hell was it back? Where was it coming from?

I jumped out of bed, determined to finish my morning routine as fast as possible — anything to escape that godforsaken room.

I cut my usual three-minute shower down to two. Threw on my daywear. Bolted down the hallway. I brewed coffee, sat at the dining table in the living room, and tried to distract myself with the news.

One article caught my attention — a startup claimed it had developed a generative AI model capable of producing photorealistic surveillance footage from text prompts.

The claim was absurd. The demo video looked polished at first glance, but the flaws were obvious to anyone with experience. The human movement wasn’t smooth — subtle frame jumps broke the illusion. The people didn’t look quite human, either. And the door frame in the ATM vestibule couldn’t even hold its shape — it warped slightly between frames.

All subtle, but I’d spent years staring at real footage. I could see past the gloss.

I skimmed the rest of the article, rolled my eyes, and moved on.

I glanced at my mug, emptied of this morning’s coffee.

Why the hell would I leave it here last night? Like some barbarian?

I got up and walked to my office, just across from the bedroom. The buzzing sound was still present — unbearable. I sat on my chair, opened my computer, and pulled up yesterday’s surveillance footage from the living room camera.

I watched myself go through the day: grabbing coffee, sitting at the table, reading the news, walking to and from the office and basement lab. All normal. But I never saw myself place the mug on the table.

Not once.

What madness was this?

At exactly 11:00 PM, the feed glitched. A brief interruption — like tuning into a nonexistent channel on a 90s TV. Static. Visual and audio. Then the feed resumed.

That’s when I saw it.

The motion detection application began triggering in specific spots — but nothing was there. Nothing moved.

What. The. Hell.

I had tested this application thoroughly. Cleaned it. Sent it to QA. They passed it to DevOps. It was already deployed at customer sites. This was bad. Very bad.

I panicked and scrubbed through the footage again. The motion detection only triggered when I was present — no false positives all day. But at 11:00 PM, there it was. A false positive. Right in front of me.

I cursed. Loudly. A stream of expletives no child should hear — except maybe child processes. They didn’t care. They weren’t alive. Ha!

After recovering from that momentary lapse in sanity, I looked closer. The highlighted areas moved — slowly, deliberately — across the walkable parts of the living room. Not the ceiling. Not the walls. Just the floor. Back and forth.

At 11:12 PM, the highlighted area lingered near the dining table. Then, suddenly, the mug appeared.

At 11:13 PM, I entered the living room from the hallway. I stared at the mug, picked it up, and walked to the kitchen. The motion detection highlighted me — expected. But it also highlighted the space behind me.

As if something was following.

At 11:22 PM, I disappeared into the bedroom. The highlighted area followed. No motion was detected again until 11:53 PM. Then it reappeared — beside the dining table — and stayed there until 12:00 AM, when the feed glitched again. Static. One second. Then normal.

No motion was detected until I reentered the living room at 6:43 AM.

My thoughts raced. Surely this was an artifact — a glitch in the image processing pipeline of the application. Right?

I toggled off the motion detection overlay to view the raw footage. The more I stared, the more I saw it — a faint outline. A pattern. Hard to define.

I realized I could isolate it using my favorite image processing technique: Fast Fourier Transform. Or FFT for short.

I transformed each frame between 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM from the spatial domain to the frequency domain. A consistent, thin oval appeared in the high-frequency range of every frame. Same location. Same intensity.

Curiosity peaked. I applied a two-dimensional Gaussian-smoothed rectangular filter to isolate the feature. Reconstructed the images. Compiled them into a video.

Then I watched it.

I wasn’t prepared.

The footage was blurry, mostly black and white. The table and chairs were faintly visible. But there — in the center — was something else.

A tall, slender humanoid figure. Only faintly outlined. Soft, low-contrast contours. Wispy. Unstable. Like a ripple in glass. A shadow behind static.

I must have been going mad. My mind playing tricks. I was overworked. Yes. Overworked like a dog.

I reran the FFT processing. It was still there. I changed the parameters. Ran it again. Still there.

Either I was losing my mind — or this thing actually exists.

I flipped through the processed frames like stills from a horror film. The figure moved. Walked. Shifted. Changed shape.

Sometimes it became a cloud. A mist. Sometimes a tall, insect-like creature standing on its hind legs. The closest comparison I could think of was a mantis.

Then, at around 11:53 PM, the thing — the entity, whatever it was — reappeared. It slowly transformed back into a tall, humanoid shape. I watched as its head turned, slowly, deliberately. Like it was staring directly into the camera.

It held that pose until the feed was disrupted at 12:00 AM.

That was it. I needed a walk. I needed to call in sick — for the first time in five years working here.

My boss would understand. Right?

It was 7:37 AM. Enough time to do a final review, send the software to QA, call in sick, take a walk... and maybe never return.

Just keep walking. Into the sunset, maybe.

Yeah. That sounded nice.

My bladder was tingling — a warning sign from all the coffee I’d consumed.

I stood up and noticed the office door was open.

I swear I closed that door. I always close it when I’m working. Always.

I stepped into the hallway and looked left, then right. Nothing. I saw nothing. I heard nothing.

Wait.

I didn’t hear the sound.

That high-pitched Godforsaken tone — the one that had haunted me for days — was gone.

Normally, that would bring relief. But now, it terrified me. The silence felt wrong. 

I was too afraid to run to the bathroom. But I had to try. For the sake of my bladder.

I stepped out of the office and hurried into the bedroom, then the bathroom. Everything looked normal — except for the silence. That unnatural, oppressive silence.

After relieving myself, I walked through the house, checking every room. Every window. Every door that led outside. All were locked. The security system was still active. Nothing had triggered it.

I stood in the living room, debating whether to deactivate the system, when a sudden sensation gripped me — the feeling of being watched.

I turned around.

It looked familiar. But wrong.

The coffee table was too long — stretched unnaturally. The dining table looked shorter than it should, while the chairs around it seemed taller, almost looming. The room itself felt wider, but also compressed vertically, like the ceiling had dropped a few inches. The chandelier above the dining table emitted a faint blue glow, layered over its usual warm light, casting strange shadows that didn’t align with the furniture.

The walls had a subtle curvature, like the room was bending inward. The corners didn’t meet at perfect angles anymore. The air felt thicker, like walking through static.

I panicked.

I fled to the office, slammed the door shut, and locked it behind me.

Inside, the office was my sanctuary — or at least, it had been. But even here, things were wrong.

The bookshelf to my left was closer than it should have been, almost pressing against the desk. The desk itself looked warped — subtly curved, like heat had softened its edges. My monitor was normal in shape, but the screen emitted a faint purple glow, even when idle.

The walls felt too close. The ceiling too low. The air too still.

I sat down, trying to steady my breathing. I needed to think. I needed to believe this was all in my head.

I must’ve been having a mental breakdown. Yeah. That’s it! Hahaha! Can’t fool me, brain!

I logged into my computer and typed a message to my boss: *Too sick to work today.*  I hit send.

Nothing happened.

No confirmation. No sent icon. But the computer was still connected — Ethernet, full signal. It should’ve sent.

I grabbed my phone, hoping to try again — but immediately yelped and dropped it.

It was wrong.

Twisted. Bent. Warped beyond recognition, save for the screensaver I’d chosen. It looked like a pretzel. A grotesque, digital pretzel.

I laughed. A hearty, broken laugh.

How was this possible?

Then it hit me — why hadn’t I left the house? The exit was right there. Right beside the home security panel I’d been staring at earlier. Why did I go back to the office?

Then the motion detection alerts started.

First from the living room. One minute long.

Then — the office.

I looked up at the surveillance camera mounted on the ceiling. It looked thinner than usual. Shorter. Its lens glowed faintly blue. The ceiling around it reflected the same hue.

I turned toward the window behind my desk. In the glass, I saw the reflection of the office door — slowly opening.

A blinding blue light spilled in.

If I hadn’t been in fight-or-flight mode before, I was now.

The window looked just big enough to fit through. I shoved the monitor and keyboard off the desk, scattering them across the floor. I tried opening the window.

No luck.

Panicking, I scanned the room. My eyes landed on the heavy plaque hanging to the right of the window — a five-year employment award. Wood and metal. A reminder of my ungodly amount of unpaid overtime.

I ripped it off the wall and smashed it against the glass.

Crack. Again. Crack. Inch by inch, the hole widened.

Then, in the corner of my eye, I saw it.

The door behind me was fully open now. The blue light was overwhelming — almost blinding. And at the center of it stood a figure.

Barely visible. Just the faintest wispy contours. A tall, slender shape. Humanoid. But wrong.

It started walking toward me.

I freaked out. The hole in the window was no more than three feet wide — but screw it. It was do or die.

I dove through.

I landed hard on the grass outside. Thank God the office was on the ground floor. The fall wasn’t far — but the glass tore into me. Shards embedded in my arms, hands, legs.

It didn’t matter.

I ran.

No car. I’d left my keys inside. But screw that noise.

I just ran.

…

I didn’t know how far I’d run, but one of the officers patrolling the neighborhood eventually spotted me. Shelley pulled up beside me in her cruiser, concern etched across her face.

I told her the only thing I could without sounding insane — that my home had been invaded, and I’d escaped through the window.

She radioed for backup to check the house as she drove me to the nearest hospital.

While my wounds were being treated, another officer, Jeremy, approached me. He said the house was secure. No one else was there. Nothing was out of the ordinary.

The hospital patched me up with dissolvable stitches. The bill was steep, but insurance would cover some of it. My bank account would comfortably handle the rest.

Shelley offered to drive me home. I accepted. I didn’t want to stay there long. I just needed to pack.

She was kind enough to wait inside while I gathered my things.

I rushed to the bedroom, grabbed spare clothes. Retrieved my emergency laptop from the office. Then headed to the living room.

“I’m ready,” I told her.

But she frowned.

I paused. “What’s wrong?”

Her figure began to blur. The outline of her body shimmered, then softened. Wisps of transparency crept across her skin. She was fading. Becoming something else.

I stepped back, heart pounding.

Then she spoke — but it wasn’t Shelley’s voice.

It was flat. Mechanical. Like someone reading from a script they didn’t understand. No emotion. No cadence. Just words, delivered with clinical precision.

“Your performance this month was subpar at best. You did not meet one of yesterday’s deadline.”

My mind raced. Then I remembered — I hadn’t sent the daily summary. That stupid, repetitive task. Two to five sentences about what I did yesterday. I’d forgotten.

“You’re falling behind,” she continued. “If your high pay isn’t good enough to motivate you, then perhaps your life is.”

Her form shifted. Stretched. Became tall. Slender. Inhuman.

She stepped closer. Her face lowered toward mine.

“If things don’t change soon,” she whispered, “then we’ll have to make some tough decisions.”
