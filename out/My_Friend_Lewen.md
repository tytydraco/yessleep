I didn’t get to finish telling what happened that night.  
 My family has lived in the same town for generations — ever since my grandma was a kid. I was born here too, and when I was little, I loved listening to my grandma’s stories before bed. Especially the scary ones. One night, she told me about a strange rule in our town. 

“When the full moon rises, at exactly 10 PM,” she said, “never knock on the door of the last house down the fifth alley from the village entrance.” That was it. I begged her to tell me more — what happens if you do? Why? But she wouldn’t say anything else.

 Just that I should never, ever break that rule. Honestly, I thought it was just one of those creepy stories old people make up. I mean, the house at the end of that fifth alley? That’s where my friend Lewen lives. Back then, Grandma didn’t like Lewen much. She never showed it to him directly, but she always seemed uneasy about me hanging out with him. 

I figured she made up that story just to keep me away from him. After she passed away, I pretty much forgot the whole thing. Lewen and I went to the same high school and were still part of the same friend group.

 Then, one day, Lewen invited me to sleep over at his place. I was shocked. I had never been inside Lewen’s house. Not once. I’d tried visiting before when we were kids, but he always said no — usually blaming his parents. This time, though, he invited me first. I was pumped. 

I asked if we were heading there straight after school, but he said we had to stop by somewhere first with Jack and Sweller. We were meeting in the afternoon. Jack and Sweller were already at the meeting spot when I got there. We were just waiting for Lewen. They were super hyped too — probably the first of Lewen’s friends to actually step inside his house. Jack even brought a dirty magazine to hide in Lewen’s room as a prank. Lewen showed up shortly after, and we headed into town. 

He said there was a place we needed to go first. Turned out it was just some random antique shop.We were like, “Seriously? This is it?” No girls with us or anything. Kind of lame.But Lewen just ignored us and started searching through the shelves like he was looking for something specific. We browsed around for a bit. Then he finally picked something, paid, and said, “Let’s head home.” 

It was around 8 PM when we got to his house, if I remember right. We walked in, expecting to greet his parents — but no one was home.He said they were out of town, which is why he could finally invite us over. Made sense, I guess. Maybe his parents were the reason we weren’t allowed there before.

 Honestly? That just made it better. We ordered a pizza, settled in, and played games on the couch while we waited. When the pizza came, we scarfed it down and kept gaming for a while. Eventually, we got bored, and I remembered that thing Lewen bought at the antique shop. “What’d you buy earlier, anyway?” I asked. He shrugged. “Nothing important. Don’t worry about it.” Of course, that just made us more curious. So Jack and Sweller teamed up with me, pushing him to spill the beans.

 He glanced somewhere for a moment, then said, "If you wanna know... wait outside for a bit." We figured he was setting something up — maybe a surprise? We were the first friends to visit, after all. So we stepped outside, kind of excited. After a little while, we heard him call out,“Alright. It’s ready.” We reached for the doorknob — but it was locked. “Hey! Open the door!” we yelled.“It’s locked!”

 Lewen’s voice came from the other side.“Knock.” So we did. And the door opened. Lewen was standing there. But something was wrong.

 There was smoke inside. Or fog? I don’t even know. The air felt... thick. I tried to say something, but then everything spun. Like my brain flipped. Then, nothing. Black. I think I passed out.

 When I came to, I was tied to a chair. There was a triangle drawn on the floor around me. Like, with chalk or paint or something. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even think. All I could focus on was: Where the hell are Jack, Sweller, and Ruwen? That was it. That’s all I could think. Then the fear kicked in. It was dark. Smelled damp and moldy. Just one flickering lightbulb above me. That was the only light. I started shouting. First I called out their names. Then I just started cursing. Loud. Over and over. 

And that’s when I heard it— A door opening. Footsteps, coming from above. I looked up. Some old guy and lady were coming down the stairs. Never seen them before. I screamed. “Please! Let me go! I don’t know what this is—please!” 

They just stared. Blank faces. Then they walked off to the corner and pulled something out. It was a mirror. And when they brought it in front of me, I saw what had been messing with my head this whole time. The reflection? It wasn’t me. It was Ruwen. Like—I looked like him. I had his face. I wasn’t me anymore. I started freaking out. Yelling, crying, trying to understand what was happening. “What did you do?! Why do I look like him?! WHERE ARE MY FRIENDS?!” They didn’t answer. 

They just put some weird necklace around my neck. I remembered seeing it earlier that day, in this creepy antique store we went to. Ruwen was looking at it. Then it all started spinning in my head. 

Was he in some cult or something? Was this some sacrifice ritual? Did Jack and Sweller get taken too? Or were they part of this? 

And then the woman finally spoke. “Those who knock must pay the price.” That line. That’s what triggered it. A memory I didn’t know I still had. Something my grandma once said when I was a kid: “Never knock on the door at the end of the fifth alley during a full moon. Especially not at 10 o’clock sharp.” We did that. Tonight. It was a full moon. And when we knocked… it was almost exactly 10PM. I was shaking. What was the price? Why the hell do I look like Ruwen?! Then she said: “Five hours remain.” I lost it. Screamed until I couldn’t breathe. Begged, cried, cursed. 

Then the guy clamped his hand over my mouth. Tight. I couldn’t make a sound. And I heard it. A knock. Far away. Then both of them said, together: “Four hours.” And left. I tried to get out. Wiggled the chair, rocked it hard. It creaked, but that’s it. I wasn’t going anywhere. I don’t know how long I sat like that. 

I felt like I was dying. Then I heard the door again. Footsteps. It was them. They started drawing again—same triangle, with white powder. All around me. Careful. Exact. I begged again. “I’m sorry! Please! I’ll never come back, I swear!” They didn’t speak. Just stared. Then looked up. At a clock on the wall. As it hit the hour, the guy covered my mouth again. Another knock. “Three hours.” That’s all they said. And they left.
