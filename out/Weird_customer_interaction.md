This is a situation that happened a few weeks ago at my job. Working as a gas station cashier means that weird customer interactions aren't exactly uncommon, doubly so when you’re working the night shift. If you’re lucky you might have a coworker on your shift, but that’s never a guarantee. However, I have never had a customer interaction like this before, and I really hope I never have one like it ever again. Let me just explain what happened.  
  
The gas station where I work is pretty far from anything, it’s along a major highway, but whoever previously owned the rights must have been a good salesman to offload this store. We aren’t busy. Customers tend to come in waves, 20 minutes of chaos, and then dead, empty night for hours. The night of the incident was pretty normal, customers filtered in and out, buying snacks, scratchers, and coffee. There’s a certain kind of desperation that customers get around 1:00am, they know what they want, and they know you’re the only one that can give it to them. During the downtime you kind of drop your guard. You feel like you’ll never see another person again.  
  
It was during that downtime that my problem customer showed up. It was maybe 1:40am, and I had sold a dozen packs of cigarettes, some scratchers, and a cup of coffee to basically every customer. I had been sitting behind the counter, leafing through some car magazine I took off the shelf, trying to save the waning battery of my phone, when I heard something from outside the door. It was a thumping sound, almost a sensation that I could feel in my bones, Thump - Thump - Thump.  
  
I could tell whatever it was, was coming closer to the door. Through the yellow haze of the store I stared at the glass door hoping to catch a glimpse of whatever it was. I considered hiding behind the counter, but there was nothing to hide from. Just the inky blackness of the night, diluted only by the light of the gas pumps. I looked away from the door, hoping to see something on our cheap security camera. Nothing, just a haze of grey spots squirming like insects making out the shape of the pumps, no cars, no people, nothing out of the ordinary.  
  
The lights of the station flickered and the thumping sound became nearly painful, like my brain was actively resisting the sensation. That was when I saw it, half a dozen gnarled black hands reaching out from the closed door, pulling something massive behind them. The hands squeezed the frame of the door, cracking the glass and warping the metal frame. They moved further into the store, grasping at anything they could reach, pulling merchandise off the shelves, bending and warping whatever they touched, as though reality itself was repulsed by the thought of interacting with such a being. The entire store strained with each pulse of the entity’s flesh, and my mind along with it.  
  
The full extent of the mass had finally made its way into the store.  
  
The creature was immense, its size almost indeterminate, and the composition of its body constantly in flux. Its skin, if it even was that, was that same inky blackness of the night, almost intangible in the same way, but shiny, iridescent like a pool of oil. Its thin sinewy arms flailed around grasping the air, as though they had a mind of their own, but always, constantly bringing the creature closer to me. As it got closer I could see its face, in the centre of the mass. It consisted only of a slowly opening mouth, full of blunt crooked white teeth, strings of saliva forming as it stretched itself into a facsimile of a smile.

A sound came from the thing, my mind clearing as it did. The thumping sound was gone, replaced with a low rumble from its mouth. Not words, just a deep rasping noise. Then, the sound started changing, forming into words, maybe not that I could hear, but deep within my mind.  
  
“I NEED SMOKES, GIVE ME A PACK OF REDS”  
  
I stumbled back into the shelf, unable to fathom the request, we don’t stock the brand. I stumbled over my words but managed to reply, “We don’t sell Marlboro Reds … it’s- it's an American brand. Would you like Rooftop Fulls, they’re basically the same.”  
  
The customer responded, its voice now sounding like the gurgle of a boiling pot, “…FINE.”  
  
I unlocked the cigarette cabinet and retrieved a pack of darts, “It’ll be $21.00”

The customer grumbled something to himself, itself, as its hands turned inwards, reaching inside of its body and returning, holding a $100 bill. Three of the hands moved towards the counter dropping it in front of me. The other hands pulled a cigarette from the pack, lighting it in the creature’s mouth.  
  
“You can’t light that in here”  
  
The customer grumbled yet again. Then in the blink of an eye, began to vanish, its viscous, shimmery black flesh becoming papery thin, almost translucent as the lights of the store flickered, plunging the room into darkness.

In seconds the lights flickered back on. I looked around the store, half expecting the damage to be gone, but the store was just as the customer had left it, leaking bottles of motor oil, crushed snack cakes, and broken glass littered the floor. On the counter in front of me lay the customer’s payment, I picked it up and held it towards the light. 

An obvious fake.
