*Лес, друг, старик святой, хозяин мудрый.  
До меня приходили - ты кормил, берёг.  
Теперь я к тебе пришёл, накорми и обереги.  
Я на земле вырос, ты на земле вырос.  
Мы одного корня, но твоё время - века, моё время - года.  
Будь мне другом, и я тебе буду другом.*

Karelia, Russia, late August of 2021.

My grandfather had succumbed to COVID complications in the winter of 2020, and I decided to go on a fishing trip to the place he'd taken me as a kid. It was my quiet way of saying goodbye, of letting the echoes of those old memories settle one last time.

The spot is known to locals as Черный Волок (Chernyi Volok), a chain of five interconnected lakes cradled by the endless Karelian taiga, where the forest presses in like an ancient guardian, watchful and indifferent.

The name itself feels out of place for bodies of water: *Chernyi* means black, *Volok* derives from "волочь" (voloch'), an old verb for hauling or dragging. I figure it traces back to Peter the Great's era, when ships were laboriously dragged across this forgotten route from Sumozero to Vygozero—check the geography if you're curious—but that's beside the point, really.

Getting there begins with a couple of hours grinding over gravel from the nearest "village," which is little more than a desolate strip of a dozen houses, half of them crumbling into abandonment. Then comes 30 minutes of rutted dirt road, before the true trial sets in: two to two-and-a-half hours on a path laid down in the 1700s, a brutal moonscape that had me pulling over every 15 minutes to fight back nausea, courtesy of the UAZ SGR's suspension. It was the first time I'd ever felt seasick on solid ground.

Along the way, a couple of swift streams demand crossings over half-rotten, 300-year-old bridges, haphazardly reinforced with logs felled by fishermen who'd dared these parts before me.

At the first lake, I unloaded my gear, inflated the two-person rubber boat, and pushed off into the still water. I crossed that first expanse, then hauled everything—boat and all—over a narrow strip of land to the second lake, repeating the ritual until I reached the fourth shore. There stood the sturdy log shelter Grandpa and his buddies had pieced together back in the '80s: hardly a hut, more like a weathered box designed to hold back the elements, but it promised warmth in a place that offered none.

I'd planned to spend two days there alone; on the third, my uncle would join, and we'd pass the rest of the week casting lines into the depths.

I weighed my options for nights—hut or UAZ? In retrospect, the truck would have been wiser, but the fire pit drew me in, along with the soft, dry moss underfoot, the lingering warmth of the sun, and the wind that scattered the mosquitoes like unwelcome thoughts. I unpacked and settled.

I should mention the comms—or lack thereof—right about now. Cell service was a joke, too remote for any signal. That left the handheld transceiver, which could stretch 5-7 km if hooked to the improvised antenna: a copper wire leading to an aluminum rod, dangled high on a branch above the hut. Unless someone happened to be within that radius with a radio—a miracle in this emptiness—I was utterly alone.

In went the spare dry clothes to my backpack, alongside the head torch, thermal blanket, fire starter kit, loaf of bread, tea, sugar, salt, cellophane, a coil of rope, multitool. I slung the hatchet and pot on one side, the TOZ-106 shotgun—Uncle's insistent gift—on the other, with my knife sheathed at the belt. The tackle box followed, plus spare batteries for the handheld transceiver and a box of 20-gauge shells.

Man, the fish in those lakes—they were something else, teeming in numbers that bordered on the unnatural. The bobber would barely kiss the surface before it vanished, yanked under by an 800-900 gram perch, real units for freshwater.

But after 20 minutes, the thrill faded; there was no anticipation when the bites came without pause. Still, I pulled in enough to last for days, stacking them like quiet victories.

As I reeled in yet another, a splash caught my ear—10 meters to the right, right at the shore. Squinting through the bilberry bushes, I made out something eel-like wiggling its way onto land. "Shit," I chuckled inwardly, "so much fish in here, they're pushing each other out."

It wiggled further, then reared up like a cobra, its tiny black-dot eyes locking onto mine. A weasel. I rolled my eyes and scoffed at the bold little bandit, likely drawn by curiosity or the promise of an easy meal.

Kneeling down, I tossed a perch its way; it bolted back into the water's safety. Afterward, I gutted and salted the rest of my catch, wrapping them in cellophane before stashing them safely inside the hut.

The afternoon stretched out as I boated along the shoreline, scouting potential spots for nets later on. The lake wasn't vast, and I knew I'd circle back by dusk, letting the quiet rhythm of the paddle guide me.

Here and there, mossy remnants of old piers clung to the banks, crumbling into the earth—mesmerizing relics that whispered of lives long gone. Three centuries ago, workers had stood in these same spots, washing their clothes in the cold flow, fishing for a simple supper, hauling massive ships under a sky that hadn't changed.

In the southeastern corner, a beaver dam bridged the river to the third lake—a convenient shortcut that would spare me the overland haul on the way back.

As I rounded a cliffy islet, spiked with firs and pines whose roots clung to the rock like stubborn miracles, I spotted a meter-wide hole burrowed into the yellowish clay beneath one pine's gnarled base. A bear den. It was too early in the season for occupation, and bears tend to rotate their lairs, but the knowledge that I shared this territory stirred an unease deep in my chest. I silently thanked Uncle for the shotgun, a small anchor in the vast unknown.

I returned to the hut after sundown, beaching the boat and glancing over to where I'd tossed the perch. It was gone, which brought a faint smile— the bandit had claimed his share after all.

Starting the fire took mere minutes; soon enough, water boiled for tea, and perch sizzled in the old pan I'd found rusting inside the hut, their aroma mingling with the pine-scented air.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the wind eased, and the mosquitoes descended like a plague, driving me into the hut where I fell asleep like a log, the day's quiet labors pulling me under.

Morning arrived with a bitter edge: the gear I'd left outside had been raided. Backpack gutted, bread vanished, tea and salt scattered across the moss. Weirder still—the box of shells was missing, and so was the copper wire for the antenna. Leaving things out had been foolish; I could understand wildlife sniffing around the food. But the shells and wire? That sent a prickle up my spine.

I tidied the mess, hauling what remained inside, and scanned the ground for tracks. Nothing—no prints, no signs.

The woods felt unnaturally hushed that morning, a silence that settled like fog. The first day had pulsed with life: birds chirping from the branches, squirrels scampering up and down trunks, the subtle symphony of the forest. Now, only the wind whispered through the treetops, as if the taiga itself held its breath.

I'm no zoologist, but I could piece it together: a predator lurking nearby. My mind drifted back to the bear den, and I clicked my tongue in dismissal. "Nah," I reasoned, "it's at the tail end of summer fattening, gorging on fish and berries. No real interest in me or a loaf of bread. It would've left tracks, scat, or woken me with its bulk." With one in the chamber and four in the magazine, I figured I'd manage.

The fish were reluctant that day, too—only the occasional hungry taker, none of the frenzy from before. The air had turned colder, a gray front rolling in from the north-northwest, which explained it. Freshwater species are attuned to such shifts, their swim bladders acting like built-in barometers. When atmospheric pressure drops, the bladders bloat, signaling an approaching storm: time to hunker down, conserve energy in the depths.

It was an omen for me as well—to prepare, to cook while I could, and to settle in. I stashed heaps of dry wood inside the hut, a rational precaution that, in hindsight, may have been what kept me whole.

The rain hit around 4 PM, slamming down with a mean wind that set the pines creaking and whining, as if they were murmuring complaints to one another in the gathering gloom. It persisted through sunset; the downpour eventually tapered, but the gusts lingered, cold and relentless, whipping the taiga into a restless murmur.

Around 9 PM, lulled by the howling gale outside, I must have dozed off, the door left ajar to let in the wild night's breath.

I couldn't pinpoint what woke me—the wind slamming the door against its frame, perhaps? But seconds later, I knew it wasn't that. A clear "помогите" (pomogite)—a cry for help—drifted in from 200-300 meters southeast, cutting through the dark.

I sprang outside, ears straining into the night. There it came again, sharper this time.

Something was off: the syllables hung separate, each rising like a question. Not "pomogite," but "po? mo? gi? te?" The voice carried a feminine lilt, or perhaps a young man's high timbre.

Hesitation wasn't an option—as far as I was concerned, someone was out there, hurt or lost in the middle of the night. I grabbed the head torch, the TOZ, and bolted southeast, keeping the shoreline in peripheral view on my left, a lifeline against getting turned around. No point in rescue if I became the one needing it.

I yelled into the dark: "I'm coming! Keep calling—talk to me, help's on the way!"

Silence answered. When I'd covered about 300 meters—my rough triangulation of the source—another "po? mo? gi? te?" echoed, but now straight east, the distance unchanged.

"Are you stupid?" I muttered under my breath, pushing forward. "Stay put, respond!" Maybe the water nearby was warping the sound, playing tricks with echoes?

Another 100-150 meters passed in tense quiet. Then the cry returned—fading further ahead, pulling me deeper.

My heart lodged in my throat; even now, typing this, chills trace my skin. "It's luring me away from the shore."

What "it" was, what it wanted—those questions hung unanswered. All I knew was that following meant death, swallowed by the taiga's indifferent maw.

A primal instinct surged through me: I gripped the shotgun so tightly, it felt like my palms would leave permanent imprints in the wood.

Mustering what courage remained, I bellowed: "Are you injured? Why not come toward my voice?"

Nothing. I spun, the torch beam slashing through the blackness—empty voids staring back. Then a branch cracked, no more than 20 meters away, sharp as a warning.

Ego whispers of heroic stands, but truth is raw: I fled, running as if hellhounds nipped at my heels, my pants remaining unsoiled a small miracle in itself.

I burst back toward the water's edge, veering left along the shore to the hut. "Pomogiiite?" drifted from behind—more coherent now, almost human in its desperation.

"Go fuck yourself, buster," I laughed nervously to myself, the hut's silhouette rising like a bastion in the gloom.

I stormed inside, piled wood at the entrance, doused it with the fuel starter. My fingers shook, unyielding, but somehow struck the match on the first try.

A pillar of flame roared up, two meters high, and I exhaled in shaky relief—instinct telling me "it" would shrink from the light and heat.

One more cry echoed from the original direction and distance. The last of the night.

I didn't so much as blink until dawn, ears attuned to every rustle, eyes darting through the fire's glow, feeding the flames to keep the darkness at bay. About 30 minutes after the blaze took hold, I thought of the transceiver, but remembered the antenna wire was already gone from the raid.

As the sun crested, the sounds returned—the birds' tentative chirps, splashes from the lake, squirrels resuming their scamper—as if the taiga had decided to breathe again.

I packed haphazardly, loaded the boat, and paddled toward the beaver dam with the fury of an Olympian, letting the river carry me to the third lake and beyond. Two hours brought me to the UAZ; two more to the gravel road. Knowing Uncle would pass this way soon, I waited, my mind churning through the night's fragments.

I tried to rationalize it all, to make the pieces fit neatly. Forest ravens are known mimics, clever creatures that experiment with sounds, observing which ones yield results—perhaps aping predator calls to herd deer into swamps, turning misfortune into a carrion feast for the flock.

Yet something gnawed at me: the missing shells, the vanished comms wire—both shiny, perhaps appealing to a bird's eye? But stacking coincidences like that stretched belief to the point of a PhD-level corvid. Give me a break. And even if it was a raven, could I truly dismiss the intent behind it all—as if the taiga itself, or something older woven into its roots, had chosen to test me, an outsider in a place that sees visitors once a decade, if that?

The rumble of an engine snapped me from my thoughts: Uncle, pulling up with surprise etched on his face at finding me roadside. Without preamble, I laid out the story, every shadowed detail. He listened stone-faced, interrupting not once.

When I finished, he shrugged with nonchalant ease: "Think you're the first the forest has laid claim to?" And he refused to elaborate, as if the words were enough.

We chose a tamer spot for the week's fishing, far less remote, where the taiga's grip felt looser.

On our last night together, he shared a fragment from Grandpa's past: back in the '50s, at age 10, fishing there with his own father. A similar tale—voices drawing him deeper into the woods, a lure that felt too deliberate to be mere chance.

"That was no crow," I mumbled to myself as sleep finally claimed me.
