“Dad, what is this package?” I asked into the phone, staring angrily at the large wooden crate sitting in the middle of my living room.


“Well… you know… it’s supposed to help,” he said hesitantly. “How should I put it… with your problem.”


I rubbed my eyes hard, already exhausted. My dad kept talking, stumbling over his words, trying to explain how this thing was supposed to improve my depression.


“Dad…” I tried to cut in, but by then my mom had joined the call too. “I don’t need this crap. We already talked about this.”


“I know, Pete,” my dad said quickly. “But this might actually help! I read about it in the paper. They specialize in people like you.”

“People like me?” I shot back coldly. “You mean crazy people?”


“Oh, Pete, don’t say that,” my mom said softly. “You’re not crazy… you’re just not feeling well right now. We know that.”


“Yeah,” I muttered. “Mom, Dad, I think I should go now. I’m really not in the mood for this.”


“Wait—wait, Pete,” my mom said urgently. “What if… what if you came home for Christmas? It’s only two days away. Christmas Eve is coming up… You wouldn’t have to be alone.”


I walked over to the window. The curtains were drawn, like always. I pulled them aside just enough to look outside.
Everything was gray. Dark. Cold winter weather.


“I don’t think so, Mom,” I said flatly. “But please… have that thing picked up. I don’t want it. Bye.”


I hung up.
I know it was a shitty way to act, but I just couldn’t do it. I’d been like this for almost six months. One day, it just hit me—I didn’t want to do anything anymore.
I couldn’t go to work. I didn’t want to talk to anyone. I didn’t want to see anyone.
And eventually, it got worse.
I stopped leaving my apartment altogether. It’s been almost two months now.
Every day, I just sit here inside…
drifting around my own life like I’m not really part of it anymore.


I dropped onto my couch.
The sunken spot where I’d been spending most of my days lately.
The TV was on, like always. I wasn’t really watching it. I just knew it was there—programs flickering, scenes changing—while I stared straight through it, not actually processing any of it.
My phone lit up again. It was a text from my dad.


“The courier can’t pick the package back up until next week.”


“Great…” I muttered.


I glanced at the crate.

They’d left it right in the middle of my living room, exactly where it was in the way of everything. I didn’t recognize the delivery service, and honestly, I didn’t care. I hadn’t even wanted to accept it—but of course, the food delivery guy showed up at the exact same time, and I signed for everything without really thinking.

And now it was here.

I just sat there, staring at the tall wooden crate. I don’t even know why it bothered me so much. My living room was already a mess—trash everywhere, empty boxes, dirty clothes—but somehow this thing completely threw off the whole picture.
I kept staring at the TV. That was basically my plan for the rest of the day anyway.

Then something slammed—hard.
Over the dull background noise of the TV, it sounded like a gunshot going off in my living room. I jumped to my feet, my heart skipping a beat.

I looked around,  nothing unusual at first… and then I saw it.

One of the metal rivets had shot out of the crate. The lid was partially shifted, like something inside had shoved it.


“What the hell…?” I muttered, shuffling closer. The lethargy I’d been stuck in for days made even those few steps feel like exhausting physical labor.


I pressed my hand against the loose lid. The frame was cracked where the rivet had blown out.

I thought about thermal expansion. Or poor construction. Anything, really.
But was it actually that cold outside?


“Ah, damn it…” I sighed. “I hope Dad gets his money back.”


Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted the rivet. It was embedded in the wall.
Half-buried in the drywall, like it had been fired from a nail gun.
I walked over, kicked aside a pizza box, and leaned in closer. The rivet was lodged deep.
I shook my head. Of course this would happen at a time when I barely had the energy to exist.
Then there was another loud crack. This time, the lid split completely open.


“You gotta be kidding me…” I muttered. “Go ahead. Try to scare me.”


I shuffled back to the crate. Somehow, this was the biggest effort I’d made all week, which felt almost ironic. I slid the shifted lid aside and peered through the opening.
For a second, I didn’t understand what I was looking at.
Then it clicked.
My dad had been completely ripped off. 
The crate was empty.


I slumped back onto the couch.

I wanted to call my dad and tell him that whatever they’d supposedly picked out specifically to help me didn’t even exist—but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it.
I didn’t feel like talking to them. I didn’t feel like doing anything.
I just wanted to sit. 
To exist. To not think.

So I kept sitting there, staring at the TV with my brain switched off. Shows blurred into each other while I sank deeper and deeper into the couch. It felt like my body was slowly melting into it. It didn’t take long before sleep pulled me under.


“Pete… Pete, wake up.”


A soft voice. Somewhere far away. Half a dream.


“Pete. Santa’s almost here. Wake up.”


My eyes snapped open.

For a second, I just sat there, disoriented. It was a strange dream—especially since I hadn’t been dreaming at all lately. The apartment was still dark. The TV was still blasting the same mindless shows at the same volume, like it hadn’t changed scenes in hours.
The crate was still in the middle of the living room.

But the lid had completely slid off. It was lying on the floor.
I slowly pushed myself up. At least I could still manage the bathroom. I hadn’t had the energy to shower in weeks, but somehow I always made it to the toilet.
When I reached the bathroom door, I grabbed the handle.

It didn’t move. I pushed harder. Nothing.


“What the fuck?” I muttered, staring at the door.


I yanked on the handle again, like I was only just realizing something was wrong. The lock didn’t click. It didn’t resist. It didn’t jam.
It just wouldn’t open.

I shook my head, confused. I probably locked it earlier and just don’t remember, I thought. Or maybe I imagined the whole thing. Time had been bleeding together for days now.
But when I turned back toward the living room, Everything changed.
I wasn’t standing in the living room anymore. I was already inside the bathroom.

The door was behind me—the same door that wouldn’t let me in a second ago. And in front of me, impossibly, was the exit back into the living room.
Like someone had swapped out the stage set around me.
Instantly. Without any transition.
I looked around in panic. My dark, exhausted eyes couldn’t make sense of what I was seeing.

I think I was actually starting to lose my mind.


I peed and, with this empty, numb feeling, somehow accepted the fact that I had… teleported into the bathroom.

Or maybe my brain had just skipped a beat. Maybe I’d walked in here and simply didn’t remember it. That kind of thing wasn’t exactly rare for me anymore.

I expected the door not to open on the way out either.

But the moment I pressed the handle, the lock clicked open like it always had. What I walked back into, though, wasn’t my living room.
All the trash that had been piling up for months—pizza boxes, empty bottles, garbage bags, clothes, scraps of packaging—had been stacked into a single grotesque tower. Like someone had gathered it all deliberately and arranged it with care. The pile nearly reached the ceiling.
A half-collapsed, reeking pizza box sat on top of it. Like a disgusting Christmas tree topper.


“What the fuck…?” I whispered, staring at the trash-tree in disbelief.


I hadn’t even finished processing that when I noticed something else. The TV—which had been talking nonstop for months—was now nothing but static.
That constant white noise. The kind that had always been tied to nightmares when I was a kid.
I moved closer, slowly. The image was completely distorted. Colors bleeding into each other. Shapes warped and wrong.
And yet, I could still tell what was playing.
Home Alone. Only it looked like the movie itself was melting.
Then something shifted in the corner of my vision.

I froze. My bedroom door was open.
And inside the darkness… something was standing there. Right in the doorway. Positioned so the shadows still swallowed it, but not enough to hide its outline.
And then I saw the eyes.

Two greenish, button-like points of light. Locked onto me.
Unblinking. Perfectly still. It stared at me in silence. Like it had always been there.
The air caught in my chest.


“Who are you?” I asked, my voice shaking. “What are you doing in my apartment?”


The dark figure didn’t answer.
Its tall silhouette just stared at me, completely motionless, like it couldn’t even hear my voice. The static from the TV seemed to grow louder. My heart was pounding in my chest.


“Can’t you hear me?” I swallowed hard. “How did you get in here? I’m calling the police if you don’t leave.”


I reached out blindly, feeling along the wall for the light switch in the dim glow of the TV. When I finally found it, I slammed it down almost instinctively, panic taking over.
And then two things happened at once. First—the lights actually turned on.
That alone surprised me. I would’ve sworn I hadn’t used them in months.

Second… The figure was gone.
Not just it.

The trash Christmas tree in the corner vanished too, like it had never been there. The TV image snapped back to normal, the static cut out, and Kevin McCallister’s voice came through the speakers clearly.


“What the fuck was that…?” I muttered, rubbing my eyes and talking to myself. “Am I really losing my mind?”


I cautiously peeked into the bedroom.
There was nothing there. No one. The room stared back at me, empty. Just the tangled bed and the wrinkled, overused blanket. I collapsed onto the bed.
I stared at the ceiling, and before I could put together a single coherent thought, sleep took me.


When I opened my eyes, it was morning.

Sunlight filtered weakly through the curtains. The light in the living room was still on. I must have left it that way overnight.

I stumbled out of the bedroom and looked around, confused. Not just the trash tower was gone.
Everything was gone.

In place of my filthy, garbage-filled mess was a clean, neat, almost cozy apartment. Like someone had spent days doing nothing but cleaning. Like it didn’t belong to me anymore.

I rubbed my eyes and wandered into the kitchen. I made coffee.
No matter how much I hated everything, I never skipped my morning coffee. Then, like I’d completed some important task, I dropped onto the couch. Same as always.
Time for another day of nothing.

I don’t know how long I sat there. I just stared at the TV. I didn’t care what was on. It was enough. I didn’t want to think. I didn’t want anything.

Until the TV suddenly shut off.


“What the hell?” I frowned.


I started looking for the remote, but it was like it had vanished. I couldn’t find it anywhere. I stood in the middle of the living room, hands on my hips, turning in circles in frustration.

That’s when I noticed the curtain had been pulled aside. The windowsill was visible.
And there it was—outside, beyond the glass—resting peacefully.
The TV remote. I trudged over, irritated, grabbed the curtain to pull it back, and it ripped free.

Not just fell.

Like someone had torn it straight out of the wall. The rod and the curtain crashed down in front of me, nearly giving me a heart attack.


“God damn it!” I shouted.


I barely managed to jump out of the way. I stared at the holes in the wall where the rod had been seconds earlier.


“You know what…” I muttered, kicking the pile of fabric aside. “Fuck this.”


I turned and headed back toward the bedroom, angry and exhausted. I had absolutely zero desire—none—to deal with any more of this weird shit. I was going to crawl into bed and rot there. But as I started walking, something changed.
The sun was still shining in through the window behind me… but it was being blocked.
By something rising up, swallowing the light. I turned around.

The fallen curtain was lifting.

Pointed at the top. Like someone was standing beneath it.
A shape began to form.

The curtain rose higher and higher. I couldn’t move. My throat tightened, air barely making it into my lungs. I backed away until I hit the bedroom doorway. The curtain was almost brushing the ceiling now. The bottom barely touched the floor.
Then it stopped.

I stood there shaking. Cold ran down my spine. The curtain hovered in place. Completely still.


For a moment, it felt like everything had frozen.
I locked eyes with my own curtain. Then it lunged at me.
I didn’t think. Instinct took over. I jumped into the bedroom, slammed the door shut, and threw my full weight against it.
A soft thump hit the door. Like someone had just tossed the curtain against it.

I braced myself there, mouth dry, waiting.
Nothing. Silence. Calm.

I didn’t dare open the door. I pressed my ear against it, listening. And then something slammed into the door, hard.
Into me.

I flew backward, crashing into the wall. The door exploded out of its frame. The last thing I saw before everything went black, was sunlight pouring into the living room.


I came to slowly.

I was lying on the floor of my bedroom, my back against the wall. It had gotten dark while I was out. Even so, I could clearly see that the door leading into the living room was gone.

Not open. Gone.
Its broken pieces were scattered across the floor, like something had blasted straight through it.
I struggled to my feet, my head still swimming, and only then did I really start to process what had happened. I looked around in panic, searching for the curtain-shaped thing. There was nothing there.
My curtain lay crumpled in the living room, harmless fabric again. I stepped out carefully, half-expecting something to jump at me—but nothing did.

Everything looked exactly like it had that morning.

The apartment was clean. Organized. And completely empty, except for me.

I hurried into the kitchen to get some water. But the moment I stepped inside, my heart nearly stopped. The refrigerator was open.
I approached it slowly, terrified that something would leap out. My hand was shaking as I looked inside.


The fridge was almost as empty as it always was. Almost.
There was one thing inside. A gingerbread house.

It sat on a small plate, carefully placed. White and pale-purple icing covered the roof, forming my mom’s initials. Exactly like the ones she used to make when I was a kid. Every single Christmas.

But… how was this here now?
I slammed the fridge door shut. I was really starting to get sick of all this weird shit.


I sat down on the couch again.

The TV wasn’t working at all now. I didn’t even bother looking for the remote anymore. I had no idea what was happening in my apartment, whether I’d completely lost my mind… or something far worse was going on.
That’s when my eyes drifted back to the wooden crate.

The empty box was still there in the living room, pushed neatly against the wall, like it had always belonged there.


“This piece of shit is still here…” I muttered to myself.


“Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells…”


A strange voice started singing softly. It was coming from the crate.
Someone was singing inside it.
The voice was rough and raspy—like a very old man… or someone who’d never really learned how to speak properly.


“What the fuck is this…?” I whispered, frozen.


Then two black hands rose up out of the crate. They grabbed the edge, like whatever was inside was struggling to pull itself out.


“Oh what fun it is to ride…” the voice continued.


A dark, thin shadow slowly lifted itself out of the crate. Its green eyes glowed in the dim light.
And it kept singing. It was singing the Christmas song.
My heart was racing. I thought I was about to pass out right there.
And then, as if this still wasn’t enough. My phone started ringing on the couch.
I didn’t think. I grabbed it and ran for the bathroom.


“Dashing through the snow…” the shadow croaked behind me as it climbed out of the crate.


I burst into the bathroom, slammed the door shut, and locked it. I flipped on the light instantly, and panic took over—I dove into the bathtub.

I was gripping my phone so hard I thought it might crack. And only then did I look at the screen.
Dad was calling.


“Dad!” I shouted into the phone. “What is this crate? What did you send me?!”


“Oh, Pete…” my dad said, surprised. “I didn’t think you’d answer. I just wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas…”


“Okay, fine,” I snapped. “There’s someone here, Dad! I need help!”


That’s when something started pounding on the bathroom door. Not knocking.
Pounding—like fists slamming into it. The whole room shook.


“Dad, listen to me—this is really bad,” I was almost screaming now. “What did you buy me?!”


“Well… a gift, Pete,” he said calmly. “That’s your Christmas present.”


“What?!” I stammered. “Where did you even get something like that?!”


“Ho. Ho. Ho.”


The voice came through the phone. It wasn’t my dad.


“What the hell was that?” I asked, terrified.


“Oh, that’s great, Pete,” my dad said cheerfully. “Santa’s here. He just arrived. Come say hello.”


“Ho. Ho. Ho, Pete,” someone said, taking the phone. “It’s Christmas, for fuck’s sake. Don’t be such a coward. Get out of the tub and celebrate.”


“What the fuck is happening?!” I screamed.


“Ho. Ho. Ho…” the voice laughed.


I hung up.
This was all insanity. Something was still slamming against the bathroom door—but the worst part came next.


“Ho. Ho. Ho.”


The same voice. But now it was inside the bathroom. Coming from the closet.


“Ho. Ho. Ho…” it grew louder.


Cold sweat ran down my neck. My head was ringing. The sounds blurred together. I was panicking. I had no other choice.
I climbed out of the tub and rushed to the window. The fire escape was right there. My only chance. I pulled the curtain aside, and something was standing outside.

It was big. Brown. Flat.

I squinted into the darkness, and my stomach dropped when I realized what it was.
A gingerbread man stood on the fire escape.
As tall as me. And it was waving.
I yanked the curtain shut.


“Ho. Ho. Ho! I’m right here, Pete!” the stupid Santa voice called from the closet.


“Go fuck yourselves!” I screamed, and lunged for the bathroom door.


I ripped it open and burst out. The living room was empty. The black, singing shadow was gone.
For a second, I didn’t even know where to run. Then it started.
Bells.
Small bells, like a thousand of them ringing at once.
Carol of the Bells screamed from every direction. I could feel it pounding in my chest. My head went numb.


“Shut up!” I yelled, dropping to the floor and clamping my hands over my ears.


That’s when something jumped onto my back.
Like a sack being thrown over me. A bony, clawed hand twisted my arm behind me, while the other dug deep into my skull.
I screamed.


“It’s Christmas, Pete,” the black shadow whispered into my ear. I caught a glimpse of its emerald-green eyes at the edge of my vision.


“Get the fuck off me!” I choked, thrashing with everything I had.


The thing let go.
I threw myself forward. Crawled. Slid. Scrambled toward the front door. I was gasping like a wounded animal. I could feel blood running down my head, but the bells were still screaming.

I reached the door and threw it open. The lock gave way.

I ran.

Down the hallway. Down the stairs. I slipped, fell down a few steps, smashed my arm into the railing—but I didn’t care. I just needed to get out.
I burst out of the building. The old wooden gate flew open. I jumped the last few steps.
I was gasping for air. I leaned against the roof of my car, hands shaking.

The street was empty.
Lights were on in the surrounding apartments. Inside, people were celebrating. The cold air turned my breath into white clouds.
That’s when I noticed it.

Snow.
It was everywhere.
I felt cold flakes melting on my head. I looked up into the night and watched the snowfall grow thicker. I hadn’t seen snow in a long time.
It was beautiful.

Out here.
In the open.
