I didn’t find the flyer.  
It found me.

Folded inside the sleeve of a vinyl I didn’t buy.  
No label. No note. Just warm paper that felt wrong.  
Like it had been waiting.

It smelled like copper.  
The corners were singed.  
The text looked burned on.

There was no date.  
Just coordinates.

I should’ve burned it.

The warehouse was deep past the city, where even the GPS gave up.  
Tall. Narrow. Wrong.

Inside: no staff. No soundcheck.  
No music yet—just a crowd already moving like they knew what was coming.

And above them, nested in steel and wire, stood the DJ.  
Azazel.

Not touching the decks.  
Just watching.  
Like he already knew who wouldn’t leave.

The Track didn’t start.  
It descended.

Bass first—slow, alive, heavy.  
A heartbeat inside the dark.

Then came whispers.  
Backmasked prayers. Sobbing played in reverse.  
Static that didn’t touch your ears—it climbed inside your thoughts.

And then—

>

I recognized it.  
That line.

The remix.  
I’d played it before.  
I’d dropped it at 2AM in rooms packed with sweat, glitter, and blow.  
Back then, it meant freedom.

Here, it felt like consent.

Not sampled.  
Not sung.  
**Spoken.**

And my body had already said yes.

We didn’t dance.  
We moved.

Like our bodies had remembered something we never learned.

A man beside me bent backward until his spine cracked.  
Then stood again. Still nodding. Eyes rolling.

A girl bit into a glowstick.  
It burst.

She started glowing from the inside.  
Her lips dissolved.  
Her scream came out as perfect synth.

Someone dropped to their knees and began smashing their head into a subwoofer.  
Once. Twice. Ten times.

On the eleventh, his skull caved in—  
and the speaker blew out.

But he didn’t fall.  
He kept swaying.  
Neck limp.  
Still dancing.

Another raver spun too fast.  
His spine popped.  
His eyes burst—not out, but inward.  
Like the bass crushed them from behind.

He never stopped moving.

They didn’t want to stop.  
And neither did I.

I looked up at the booth.

Azazel wasn’t DJing.  
His hands floated above the decks, twitching like wires searching for a socket.

When the strobe hit—just once—I saw him:

>

Not a man.  
Not a mask.  
Not human.

He wasn’t mixing the Track.  
He **was** the Track.

The drop hit again.

A woman ripped off her arms.  
Left them behind.  
Still clapping.

Another man fell to the floor, his chest split open like a speaker cone—  
and he danced harder.

>

We all knew.

We just didn’t care anymore.

A strobe exploded above the floor.  
For one flicker of darkness—  
I saw everything.

The floor wasn’t concrete.  
It was carved.

Blood runes. Circles.  
Cables running into spines.  
Our bones wired into the beat.  
The sound **playing through us**.

We weren’t dancing.  
We were conducting.

I don’t remember leaving.

But I woke up.  
In my bathtub.  
No phone. No ID.  
Just the flyer, stuck to my chest—wet and still warm.

Now my legs twitch when I sleep.  
Sometimes I wake up standing.  
Sometimes I wake up… nodding.

They say the Dance Plague of 1518 was mass hysteria.  
It wasn’t.

It was the first loop.  
The first drop.

And it still plays.

New city. New name. Same Track.  
Same sacrifice.

If you find the flyer—burn it.  
If someone sends you the file—don’t open it.  
If you hear that phrase—**“I want your soul”**—and your foot starts to tap?

**Run.**

Because the beat is viral now.  
It spreads through whispers.  
Through rhythm.  
Through memory.  
Through this post.

>

You’re nodding.  
Aren’t you?

Maybe you danced to it once.  
Maybe you still are.

*Check your foot.*  
*Is it moving?*

*Did you start nodding somewhere around the first drop?*

If you’ve made it this far—  
**you’re already part of the loop.**

When the silence comes…  
**that’s when it starts again.**
