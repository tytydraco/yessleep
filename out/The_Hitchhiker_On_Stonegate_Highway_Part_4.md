CW: Child Abuse

The voice was familiar. Not just the sound of it, but the weight behind it, the pressure it created in my chest the moment I heard it. It dragged a memory along with it, like a hook buried deep in my mind. The truck driver, Those headlights. The question. And suddenly I understood something that made my stomach churn. When the hitchhiker left my body, he hadn’t left alone. Something of me had gone with him.

I could feel it now as a dull awareness, like a limb that had fallen asleep yet still existed somewhere. There was a voice chained inside the truck driver’s head, faint but alive. The hitchhiker had cornered him, buried him deep, the way he had once buried me. The driver wasn’t gone, not entirely, just suppressed, watching from a place where thought barely reached. And somehow, impossibly, I wasn’t outside this anymore. I wasn’t whole, but I wasn’t trapped either. I felt closer to the hitchhiker than to myself, moving alongside him, sharing space without his knowledge, free in a way the truck driver wasn’t.

Meanwhile I could feel the language, it was still echoing in my brain, my actual body. It was swirling around in my mind. Looping itself over and over, as if the hitchhiker had left its remnants inside of me. The language didn't seem as foreign, it had become familiar, as if my mind had learned it, or my soul. I couldn't fathom.

The same one that had haunted me before, the same echo that once scraped against my thoughts like metal on bone. But this time it was different. The sound didn’t repel me. I didn’t just hear the language, I understood it. Every sound carried meaning. Every cadence unlocked something already waiting in me, as if I had known it long before memory. It settled into my thoughts naturally, like breath finding lungs.

And with that understanding came the memories.

They didn’t rush in all at once. They unfolded slowly, like something ashamed of being seen. As the language threaded itself through my mind, it stitched me deeper into the hitchhiker’s memories, until the line between his past and my awareness dissolved. The figures I had feared before; the three men began to lose shape. Their edges softened, stretched, and twisted. The hitchhiker hadn’t been chased by them. He had made them, they were mere constructs of his imagination.

With every word of that language they started to fade out, words had been giving them meaning, and not just meaning but existence in the astral space.

I went deeper, it felt like swimming inside his mind. I was completely submerged under his imagination, the language.

Digging deeper, I saw him taking his family without their consent.
He drove with them in silence, broken only by pleading and thin, terrified sobs.
The crying I had heard before hadn’t belonged to the forest or the fog.
It had been them.

At the campsite, he lit the fire himself.
He made them sit there, then turned away, carrying something heavy I couldn’t make myself see.

I didn’t witness what followed.
I only felt the moment the world changed.
The fire crackled louder, the forest went still,
and the crying stopped...one presence at a time.

When it was over, their souls clung to the trees…fused with them, trapped in forms that almost resembled people because memory refused to let them be anything else.

The hitchhiker tried to leave after that, remorseless. But His van wouldn’t start. So he stood by the road, thumb raised.



And karma arrived fast.. A truck didn’t slow down. It didn’t stop, It struck him hard enough to tear life from his body in an instant. I felt the impact echo through the memory; the shock, the sudden emptiness. His soul rose where his body fell, confused, furious and incomplete. The sky darkened. The shooting stars ignited all at once. The men I had seen before were never real. They were constructs, placeholders his mind kept replaying. That was why they lingered in mirrors. That was why they never moved forward. They were memories stuck in reverse.

Knowing all this, I understood what I had to do next.
