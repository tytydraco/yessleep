The voice was familiar. Not just the sound of it, but the weight behind it, the pressure it created in my chest the moment I heard it. It dragged a memory along with it, like a hook buried deep in my mind. The truck driver. Those headlights. The question. And suddenly I felt something settle into place, something that made my stomach churn.

When the hitchhiker left my body, it didn’t feel like he left alone. Something of me felt missing, as if it had gone with him.

I could sense it now as a dull awareness, like a limb that had fallen asleep yet still existed somewhere. I sensed a presence chained inside the truck driver’s head, faint but alive. The hitchhiker had cornered him, buried him deep, the way he had once buried me. The driver wasn’t gone, not entirely, just suppressed, watching from a place where thought barely reached. And somehow, impossibly, I wasn’t outside this anymore. I wasn’t whole, but I wasn’t trapped either. Somehow, I felt closer to the hitchhiker than to myself, moving alongside him, sharing space without his knowledge, free in a way the truck driver wasn’t.

Meanwhile, I could feel the language. It was still echoing in my brain, in my actual body. It swirled around in my mind, looping itself over and over, as if the hitchhiker had left its remnants inside me. The language didn’t seem as foreign anymore. It had become familiar, as if my mind or something deeper had learned it. I couldn’t fathom how.

It was the same echo that had haunted me before, the same sound that once scraped against my thoughts like metal on bone. But this time it was different. The sound didn’t repel me. I didn’t just hear the language, meaning began forming around it, as if my mind was filling the gaps on its own. Every cadence unlocked something already waiting in me, as though I had known it long before memory. It settled into my thoughts naturally, like breath finding lungs.

And with that understanding came the memories.

They didn’t rush in all at once. They unfolded slowly, like something ashamed of being seen. As the language threaded itself through my mind, it felt like it was pulling fragments of someone else’s memories into me, until the line between his past and my awareness began to blur.

The figures I had feared before, the three men started to lose shape. Their edges softened, stretched, and twisted. The hitchhiker hadn’t been chased by them. I realized they might have been something he created. With every word of that language, they began to fade. The words seemed to give them shape, as if language itself had been holding them together.

I went deeper. It felt like swimming inside his mind. I was completely submerged in his imagination, in the language itself.

Digging deeper, I saw him forcing his family to come with him. He drove with them in silence, broken only by pleading and thin, terrified sobs.

The crying I had heard before hadn’t belonged to the forest or the fog, it had been them.

At the campsite, he lit the fire himself,
He made them sit there, then turned away, carrying something heavy I couldn’t make myself see.

I didn’t witness what followed.
I only felt the moment the world changed.
The fire crackled louder, the forest went still.

And the crying stopped… one presence at a time.

When it was over, it felt like something of them clung to the trees, fused with them, trapped in forms that almost resembled people because memory refused to let them be anything else.

The hitchhiker tried to leave after that, remorseless. But his van wouldn’t start. So he stood by the road, thumb raised.

And whatever was waiting for him arrived fast...

A truck didn’t slow down. It didn’t stop. It struck him hard enough to tear life from his body in an instant. I felt the impact echo through the memory, the shock, the sudden emptiness. His soul rose where his body fell, confused, furious, incomplete. The sky darkened. The shooting stars ignited all at once.

The men I had seen before were never real. They were constructs, placeholders his mind kept replaying. That was why they lingered in mirrors. That was why they never moved forward. They were memories stuck in reverse.

With all of this pressing into my mind, I knew what I had to do next.
