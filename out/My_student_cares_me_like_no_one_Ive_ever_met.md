I’ve been a 4th grade teacher for over 15 years and I recently made the change to teaching first. Seems easy enough right? 

On the first day of school I printed the kids some papers with some blanks to tell me about their self and maybe some of their favorite things. 
After they were done I decided we could play a game by trying to guess who wrote what. So I collected the papers and to my horror the first sheet I read was a girl named Allison’s and it said “favorite activity-death”. 

I just decided to skip over that as it might scare the other students. After that I saw more instances that this Allison girl wasn’t like other kids. For example, at lunch she was watching other kids intently and she didn’t even bring any food. All she wanted to do was watch other kids.

Another instance I saw was at recess when she didn’t want to go and play when this girl invited her, but she was just talking to herself and crawling on the ground.


After all of the parents came to get their kids, there was no one there for Allison. I felt bad, honestly because inside of me, I was thinking that maybe the reason this Allison girl is strange and demented is because if a parental absence. As a teacher I’ve always felt it was my duty to step up and be there for a child when someone doesn’t support them.

I was sitting at my desk when i felt like someone was watching me. I looked over and I saw Allison’s penetrating and violent gaze staring at me. 

“Is everything ok, Allison?” I said. 

“No mr. Patterson, you didn’t read my sheet in class.” 

I had to explain to her that one of her answers was inappropriate and that it might scare the other kids. 

“I haven’t been picked up yet because you haven’t gotten what you deserve.” 

At that moment, I felt nauseous and dizzy. I ran out of the classroom and into the teacher’s lounge where no child could get to me.

I started having a panic attack and I was hallucinating that this girl was killing my cat and my daughter. No more than 30 seconds later, my coworker mrs. Barnes was there helping me. She explained it was just a panic attack and that they happen to almost everyone from time to time. I was feeling better when mrs Barnes reassured me. 

I walked back into my classroom only to see Allison with blood and claw marks on her white shirt and a horrifying grin on her face. At that instant, I ran back into the teacher’s lounge to hide. I have been hiding behind the printer typing this in case I don’t make it out of here alive. Stay safe, everyone.
