I work at a used record store. It’s one of those places that smell like old vinyl and dust, where collectors come in hoping to find some rare first pressing, and teenagers buy band shirts for bands they’ve never actually listened to. Most days, I’m behind the counter, sorting through stacks of scratched CDs and battered cassette tapes, deciding what’s worth selling and what belongs in the trash.

Most of the time, it’s just junk and cracked cases, bootleg mixtapes, the occasional weird indie album nobody remembers. But sometimes, we get something  strange Like the CD I found in a plain, black jewel case. No cover art. No tracklist. No label. Just a title, scrawled in shaky silver Sharpie across the case: “LISTEN ALONE”

I almost tossed it. Stuff like that usually meant some garage band’s failed demo or a burned mix someone made years ago and forgot about. But there was something about it that made me pause. Maybe it was the handwriting. It wa uneven, almost frantic. Maybe it was the fact that, when I tilted it under the light, I realized the Sharpie wasn’t just ink. It was scratched into the plastic, like someone had been desperate to make sure the words stayed. I popped open the case. The disc inside was plain silver. No markings. No logos. Just a faint, oily smear across the surface, like someone had handled it with dirty hands.

“Hey, Chris,” I called. Chris was in the back of the shop, stacking boxes of vinyl. He glanced over, brushing dust off his hoodie. “What’s up?” I held up the CD. “Ever seen something like this?” He frowned, walking over. “Homemade? Looks creepy as hell.” “Think it’s worth anything?” He snorted. “Nah. But now I’m curious. You gonna play it?” I hesitated. “Maybe later.” I grinned. “If it’s cursed, don’t bring that bad juju in here.” I laughed, but something about the CD still made me uneasy. That night, I decided to play it.

That night, after my shift, I sat on my bed with my laptop open, the CD case resting beside me. I kept glancing at it, debating whether or not I actually wanted to play it. There was no reason to be weirded out, it was just a burned disc. Someone’s lost playlist. Nothing special. Still, I waited until my roommate, Sam, had gone to bed. Something about the words “LISTEN ALONE” scratched into the case made me feel like I was breaking some kind of rule. Finally, I sighed, grabbed my old CD player, and slid the disc inside.

A low hum filled my headphones. At first, I thought it was just static, like a radio station struggling to come through. Then, faintly, a melody emerged. The music was slow and eerie, played on what sounded like a warped piano. The notes wobbled, like they were slightly out of tune. It reminded me of an old music box, the kind you’d find in an attic, covered in dust. Then I heard the whispers.

They were buried beneath the music, too faint to make out. I turned up the volume. The whispers got louder. At first, I thought they were part of the song, some weird experimental layering. But the more I listened, the more they started to sound responsive. When I shifted on my bed, the whispers changed pitch. When I cleared my throat, they stuttered, like they were listening. A chill crawled up my spine. I reached for the stop button. And that’s when I heard it. Not from the headphones, but from the corner of my room, a whisper.

I ripped off the headphones and sat frozen, heart pounding. My room was silent, but something felt wrong. The air was thick, pressing against my ears. I turned on my bedside lamp. The moment the light flickered on, the pressure in the air vanished. I stared at the CD player. The track was still running, but without my headphones, I couldn’t hear anything. I hesitated, then pressed stop. Silence. I let out a shaky breath, laughing at myself. I was being ridiculous. It was just a CD. 

The next morning, I almost convinced myself I imagined the whole thing. I had been tired, half-asleep. Maybe my brain had filled in the silence with something weird. That happened sometimes, right? Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the whispers hadn’t come from my headphones. That they had been in the room with me. I shoved the CD back into my bag and decided to forget about it. But it didn’t forget about me.

That afternoon, I was working the counter at the record shop when Chris strolled in, munching on a bag of chips. “Yo, you check out that CD last night?” I hesitated. “Yeah. It was… weird.” Chris raised an eyebrow. “Weird how?” I shrugged, trying to sound casual. “Just creepy ambient stuff. Whispers and static.” Chris grinned. “Damn, I love that kinda stuff. Lemme hear it.”

I almost said no. But that felt stupid. It was just a CD. So I handed it over. Chris popped open the case, inspected the disc, then grabbed a pair of store headphones and slipped them on. He hit play. At first, he looked amused, then confused, then something else. His fingers twitched over the pause button. His expression darkened. Then he ripped off the headphones. “Dude.” His voice was barely above a whisper. I frowned. “What?” Chris swallowed. “I just heard my own voice.” A cold knot tightened in my stomach. “What do you mean?”

Chris glanced around the shop, like he wanted to make sure we were alone. He leaned in, lowering his voice. “It played something I just said. But slower. Like it had been recorded and warped.” My skin prickled. “What did it say?” Chris hesitated, then whispered: “Damn, I love that kinda stuff.” I felt something crawl up my spine. Chris took a shaky breath, then forced a laugh. “Alright. That’s messed up.” “Yeah,” I muttered. Neither of us said what we were both thinking. The CD had recorded him.

Chris and I sat behind the counter, staring at the CD like it might start talking on its own. “It’s gotta be a trick,” Chris said finally. “Like, maybe it’s got some kind of pre-recorded speech that just sounds similar to what I said.” I wanted to believe that. I really did. “Play another track,” I said. Chris shot me a look. “Dude.” “We need to know if it’s just random.” Chris sighed but didn’t argue. He slipped the headphones back on and pressed play.
I watched his expression carefully. At first, he just listened, brows furrowing. Then his face went pale. His breathing hitched. He yanked the headphones off so fast they nearly snapped.

“Chris?” He didn’t answer right away. He just swallowed, staring at the CD player. Then he muttered, “It said my name.” A cold weight settled in my stomach. “Maybe it’s—” “No.” His voice was flat. “It said, Chris. I hear you.” The store suddenly felt too quiet. The usual hum of the air conditioning, the distant sound of traffic outside was all muffled, like the world had taken a step back. I forced a laugh. “Okay, maybe someone just burned a weird experimental sound album. You know how people make those creepy AI-generated voices?” Chris didn’t laugh. He kept staring at the CD. “Yeah,” he muttered. “Maybe.” But I could tell neither of us believed it.

That night, I told myself I wasn’t going to listen again. Then, around midnight, I changed my mind.
I wasn’t even sure why. Something about the CD was nagging at me. Like an unfinished sentence stuck in the back of my mind. I sat on my bed, slid the CD into my player, and pressed play. 

The music started slow and eerie, that same off-key piano. But this time, I didn’t just listen. I paid attention. The whispers were still there, hidden under the melody. But now, I noticed something. They weren’t random. They were layered. Like there was more than one voice. I turned up the volume. The whispers grew louder. I leaned in, straining to make out words.

Then they changed. For the first time, I understood them. ”…Who is listening?” I ripped the headphones off. My skin was crawling. I wasn’t imagining it. The CD was  responding. I turned my head slightly, listening. Somewhere in the dark of my room, something shifted. I didn’t see anything. But I felt it. Like the air itself was leaning closer. I hit stop. Silence. I turned on every light in my room and didn’t sleep.

At work, I was on edge. Every time the store door creaked open, I flinched. Every time a customer walked too close, I felt my skin crawl. Chris noticed. “Dude, you good?” I hesitated. “Yeah. Just tired.”
Chris squinted at me. “This about the CD?” I hesitated too long. Chris sighed. “Look, man, I know it freaked us out, but we’re overthinking it. Probably just some creepy art project. Some sound guy playing around with audio layering and subliminal messaging.” I wanted to believe that.

But then, the store speakers turned on by themselves.A blast of static filled the shop. Customers flinched. Chris swore and rushed to the stereo. “The hell—? I didn’t touch anything,” he muttered, fiddling with the buttons. Then, through the static, something whispered. Low, Almost drowned out by the noise. But I heard it. ”…Who is listening?”

I felt cold all over. My pulse hammered in my ears.
Chris finally got the speakers to shut off. He turned to me, shaken. “Okay. That wasn’t just me, right?” I didn’t answer. Because I had bigger problems. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A shadow. Tall. Thin. Standing just outside the store window.
Watching. Then, the second I focused on it, it was gone.

I told myself I imagined it. That I was sleep-deprived. That my brain was filling in blanks that weren’t there. But deep down, I knew better. I wasn’t imagining this. And I wasn’t the only one seeing it. That night, as I was heading home, I got a text from Chris. Chris: “Dude wtf. I just saw something outside my window.”

My hands tightened around my phone.
Me: “What did it look like?” A few minutes passed. Then, Chris: “Tall. Too tall. Thought it was a tree at first but… it moved.” My blood went cold. Me: “Are you alone?” Chris: “Yeah. Why?” I swallowed. My throat was dry. Me: “Stay on the phone with me.” Chris called immediately. His voice was strained. “Dude, what the hell is going on?”

I looked back toward my apartment building. The windows were dark. The street was quiet, too quiet. I felt it again, that pressure in the air. Like something was listening. I took a breath. “I don’t think it likes when we’re together.” Chris was silent. Then, in a hushed voice: “…You think it wants us alone?” A shadow flickered at the edge of my vision. I didn’t answer. Because deep down, I already knew the truth.

I didn’t go home that night. After what Chris saw, I couldn’t shake the feeling that whatever was tied to the CD was getting stronger. It wasn’t just some creepy audio trick anymore. It was watching. And worse, it was learning. Chris and I ended up crashing at his place. We didn’t talk much. Just locked the doors, turned on every light, and tried to pretend we weren’t both jumping at every sound. Around 3 AM, I woke up to static. Not from the TV. Not from a phone. From inside the room.

I sat up, heart pounding. Chris was still asleep on the couch. The static grew louder. My eyes darted to my bag, where I had shoved the CD earlier. It was open. The disc was already in my portable CD player. And it was playing by itself. A voice crackled through the static. Soft, garbled, and wrong. “…You are listening.”

My breath hitched. The voice wasn’t distant anymore. It wasn’t just part of the recording. It was here. Chris stirred, mumbling in his sleep. Then, clear as day, the voice spoke again. “…Chris.” I lunged forward and slammed the CD player shut. The static cut off instantly. Chris jolted awake. “What the—?” I didn’t answer. I was too busy staring at the CD. Because now, for the first time, the blank disc wasn’t blank anymore.

New words had been scratched into the surface.
“LISTENING IS NOT ENOUGH.” It Wants More. Chris and I didn’t go back to sleep. We spent the rest of the night in tense silence, watching the shadows stretch across the walls, waiting for something to move. By morning, Chris looked like hell. “We need to get rid of it.” I nodded. “Yeah. But how?” Chris rubbed his temples. “Break it?”

I thought about the words scratched into the disc. Listening is not enough. A sick feeling twisted in my gut. “What if breaking it isn’t enough either?” Chris’s face darkened. We spent the rest of the day researching, anything we could find about haunted recordings, cursed objects, weird sound phenomena. Most of it was urban legend nonsense. But then, buried deep in some obscure forum, we found something. A thread from 2012. The title? “DO NOT LISTEN TO THE SONG WITHOUT LIGHTS ON.” I clicked it. The post was short.

“There’s a CD that shouldn’t exist. I don’t know where it came from. I don’t know who made it. But if you find it, you need to understand something. Listening is an invitation. It’s not just a song. It’s a door. And once it knows you’re listening, it will start to listen back. You can’t just break the CD. That won’t close the door. You have to replace it.” 

I turned to Chris. “Replace it with what?” Chris scrolled down. The replies were filled with dead accounts, deleted users. But one comment stood out. A single sentence.

“It needs a new listener”

Chris and I sat in silence, staring at the screen.
Neither of us wanted to say it. Neither of us wanted to admit what the comment meant. The CD wasn’t just cursed. It was alive. And it wouldn’t stop until someone else listened. Chris ran a hand through his hair. “No. Hell no. We’re not giving this to someone else.” I swallowed hard. “Then what do we do?” Chris didn’t answer. Because we both knew the truth. If we kept it, it would keep listening. Keep learning. Keep getting stronger. And if we broke it? What if that just let it out? The screen flickered. For a second, just a blink, the words on the forum post changed. New text. Just one sentence.

“A LISTENER CAN BECOME A SINGER.”

 The lights in the apartment cut out. The TV went to static. And in the sudden dark, a whisper: “…Who is listening?” Chris screamed. I grabbed the CD. The plastic was warm in my hands, pulsing like a heartbeat. Something was in the room with us. The air pressed against my ears, like a low frequency humming just beyond my range of hearing. The shadows in the corner of the room shifted. Chris scrambled for his phone, flicking on the flashlight. The second the light hit the corner, The shape was gone. The air felt normal again. But the words were still there. Scratched into the CD.

“YOU CAN SING NOW.”

Chris was done. He was pale, shaking. “We need to get rid of it. Now.” I nodded. “But not to someone else.” I thought about the forum post. The idea of a door. Maybe we couldn’t destroy the CD. But maybe we could close the door. Chris drove while I held the CD in my lap, feeling its faint warmth. The longer I held it, the more I swore I could hear something
static at the edges of my hearing, whispers that weren’t words yet but were trying to be. We drove out past town, toward the river. Somewhere deep inside, I could feel it resisting. Like it knew. Like it didn’t want to go.

We stopped at the old bridge. Below us, the water churned, deep, dark, and endless. I pulled the CD from its case. It felt heavier now. Like something inside was holding on. Chris hesitated. “Will this work?” I didn’t know. I looked at the disc one last time. The scratches had changed again. “WE REMEMBER.” A cold chill crawled up my spine.

Then, before I could second-guess myself, I threw it. The CD spun through the air, just a silver glint in the dark, then hit the water. And the moment it vanished beneath the surface, the whispers stopped. The air felt normal. Lighter. Chris let out a shaky breath. “Is it over?” I didn’t answer right away. But as I listened, really listened, I realized something. The world was quiet again

A week passed, then two. No whispers. No flickering lights. No watching shadows. It was over. Chris and I never talked about it again. We didn’t want to. But sometimes, when I close my eyes,when the world is perfectly silent, I swear I still hear it. Just for a second,  a faint hum, buried in the static. Listening. Waiting. But this time,

It’s waiting for someone else
