My mother, once so tanned and ethereal, turned so pale and fragile, she had bald spots showing up all around her head. She told us it was due to stress, but I saw her doing it once. Ripping clumps of hair from her scalp. Actually, we all saw it, but kept quiet and nodded as she told us excuses. She’d also walk around the house at night, peeping through all the windows from all the bedrooms, but I couldn’t blame that poor woman, she had enough.

 My father, a strong man, the best worker of the most terrific timber company of the whole town, owner of the biggest and most beautiful beard me and my brothers had ever seen. He is fragile now, like a deer. He is slim. Shaved his beard for my grandfather’s funeral, and it never grew again, only a scraggly, sparse, grey beard. I could barely look at him. He embarrassed me, and he knew it. Can’t even look me in the eyes, always has his head down, like a servant. That’s why my mother is always paranoid: she knows he wouldn’t do anything to protect her, or us.

 My older sister, a powerful woman, always had her hair and nails done, she was the symbol of femininity in my point of view. She used to give me advice about girls, would take me out of trouble and rubbed my hair when I said something funny. She is a disgrace now. It’s like my grandfather’s passing made her primal. Unlike my mother, her hair grew even more, but in an uncontrollable way. There are knots all over it, and I can smell the grease when she walks by. Her legs are hairy and her nails and toenails are big, and she never speaks, only nods and breathes loudly. I can’t feel sorry for her, I can only feel disgust.

 And, for last, my little brother Samuel Austin. He received my grandfather’s name as an homage, but it turned out to be more like a curse. He was 10 when my grandpa died, just a normal kid. Actually, no, he wasn’t normal at all. He always knew everything we talked about. He told us that he knew about the dementia and also that he was sorry for what he did to our sister, even though we never mentioned it around him. When we told Samuel that grandfather was dead, he freaked out. He screamed like someone was stabbing him in the heart, cried a lot and bit all of us while we tried to calm him down. My father, in a moment of despair, punched my baby brother on the cheek, which made him pass out. Dad started crying and mom held him. My sister had her arm bleeding because of Samuel’s bite, all of his little teeth marked on her arm. On my arm, too. On all of our arms. He was sent to a mental facility.

 I, on the other hand, am fine. I think I’ve never been that attached to grandpa. He was there at Christmas parties, Easter and other holidays. But I can’t deny he was a charming man, strong, people looked at him and admired him. He’s the only old man I know that had multiple lovers at the same time. My mother adored him and did everything she could to get him pleased. My father, an orphan since he was sixteen, was practically adopted by Austin when he married my mother. My sister, god, she was his star. He would always make comments about her, saying she was a brilliant young lady and that she was the spitting image of my deceased grandmother, whom we never even met, since she died when my mother was a teen. But, above all of us, Samuel Austin was his “soulmate”, as he used to say. They talked the same way, walked the same way, and had similar birthmarks. They shared everything with each other, and that made all of the family kind of jealous, because they all fought for his attention. Everyone, except for me, would jump off a bridge if Austin asked them kindly. 

 Then, the dementia arrived one year before his death. He started acting a little weird, but nothing exceptional. He slowly became more quiet, more confused. When we went to his house for Christmas, he didn’t even prepare anything, he was just there, lying on the couch. My mother got worried, but my father shrugged it off, saying he probably just got lost on the calendar, but we all knew grandfather was too smart for that.

 The next stage made us a little more worried. My mom went to visit him without a warning so she could take him some strawberries she had just bought. She entered his house with a big smile, carrying a brown bag full of delicious, juicy and red strawberries, until she entered the kitchen. Austin was lying on the floor in his underwear, his body covered in raw, broken eggs. He had a pan right next to him, dripping oil on the floor. She told us that he seemed surprised to see her, and when she asked what was going on, he said he was just making omelette. They, as a family, decided to mark an appointment with a doctor and find out what was going on, but when my mother went to pick him up, he got really stressed out and attacked her, pulling a clump of hair out of her head. Eventually, he realized that she was my mother, and started crying, saying that he didn’t recognize her with that outfit (a sweatshirt and blue jeans, a regular combo for my mother) and apologized deeply. 

 The doctor told us about a brain tumor, and that it was the cause of his dementia. Everyone cried a lot, and I felt bad not crying. 

 The dementia progressed, getting worse every day, but we couldn’t afford the surgery needed to remove the tumor, so we just visited him a lot, hoping it would make him get better, but it didn’t. Sometimes he recognized us, sometimes he didn’t (most of the time), but he always seemed to remember Samuel Austin. He would whisper things in Samuel's ear, and he would laugh, but they would never tell us about what they laughed at. I could tell everyone was jealous of him, they looked at him with a mix of anger and sadness. So, they did the most obvious thing: stopped taking Samuel to his place.

 Things got busy, so we decided to take turns on who would visit him for the day. We went in pairs, and it changed every time according to our schedules. I’d go mostly with my sister and dad, rarely with my mother. 

 Every time we got there, he’d be on the couch in his underwear, and would ask us the most random things, like if we were delivering the newspapers, if we were there to take his dog on a walk (his dog died 20 years ago) or if we were Samuel’s sitters. Unlike the other family members, I’ve never really tried to tell him who I was, just rented some movies he used to like or played charades with him. I hated when my sister, mother and father started to cry. My grandfather would just get confused and upset, and even though they stated every single time their relation to him, he would just ignore them and turn to me, asking for more charades.

 My father was the most persistent one. He’d tell my grandfather stories about them, would show pictures, videos, and everything he could find. His optimism started to fade away when Austin, out of nowhere, started calling my father by the name “Jeanette”, even though his name doesn’t even resemble Jeanette. It seemed like it was on purpose, but grandfather seemed so out of his mind that it was impossible for him to be pretending.

 One day, my father found a picture of them in our basement, and for some reason, he was convinced that this one picture would make him remember. It was an old, grainy photo, probably taken more than ten years ago, where Austin and my father were holding a giant fish together. He made me drive to his house at nine P.M just to show him this. I could see hope in his eyes, his legs shaking. When we got there, Austin was standing up, looking directly at us from the window. My father entered the house and cheerfully showed him the photo. “Do you remember this day, Tin?”, asked my father, with tears in his eyes. Austin looked at the picture for way too long, and then, he snapped. “Of course, that’s my son!”, he said, making my dad cry even more. “That's me! Do you remember me now??”. Grandfather laughed like this sentence was hilarious. “Jeanette, this is clearly a man”, and pointed a finger to my father in the picture. The ride home was silent.

 Another ordinary visit, me and my sister were the chosen pair. She decided to wear the dress of her prom day, which my grandfather was present in. I rented “Die Hard” in a video store nearby and bought a couple of beers. Our grandfather seemed more alert that day, like he was trying hard to remember something. He looked at my sister a lot, up and down, and smiled. I tried to put on the movie, but he turned me down and said he wanted some time alone with “the lady”, saying “he knew who she was”. My sister’s eyes got wide like she had won the lottery. She whispered in my ear “I told you I’d be the first he’d remember”, and then, I left the house and sat by the porch, drinking one of the beers I had bought. I knew he wasn’t gonna remember her, but no one else seemed to share my point of view. I knew she’d come out sad, just like our father, when she realized he just mistook her for someone else from his past. 

 She came out of the house fifteen minutes later. When I turned to her to ask how it went, I saw her shaking, her dress torn up like someone tried to rip it off, a bite on her shoulder. She wasn’t crying, but her eyes were wide open in alertness. I told her to get in the car, afraid that if I asked her about it she’d freak out. Just then I realized I had forgotten the car keys inside the house. When I got inside, I saw my naked grandfather sitting on the couch, and when he looked at me, he smirked and told me to “bring his wife again when she wasn’t on her period”.

 We stopped visiting after this. He was clearly a menace towards our family. We knew it wasn’t his fault, but no one could take it anymore. They were almost just like I described them on the beginning of the text, all fucked up. 
 Austin died four weeks after our last visit. Neighbors called the police and said that a lot of screams came from the house during midnight, like someone was being attacked. We got there at midday, and the police asked us some questions about Austin, if he lived alone, if he had anyone willing to hurt him, and a bunch of other questions. 

 They found the body. They took him from the basement and took him out of the house inside a plastic bag. My family started crying all in union, but I wasn’t able to cry. I was just mesmerized. It didn’t seem true.

 We were called to recognize the body, but there was nothing to be recognized in that thing. Whoever murdered my grandfather wasn’t just trying to rob the house or something, they clearly wanted him dead. He was completely burnt. All his body was black and broken. They cut his hands and feet off, and took all of the teeth, making it almost impossible for the police to see if it was really him, but my family were certain about it. 
 When it was time to tell Samuel, no one had the courage to do it, so I did. When I told him what happened, trying to make my words be as calming as possible, he freaked out and all of that shitstorm happened. We took him to the mental facility that same night, but I really think that wasn’t necessary. They just wanted to get rid of him, to be honest. Poor Sam.

 His funeral was weird. It was completely full of people I didn’t even know, all devastated about his death. My family kept quiet the whole ceremony, and refused to make a speech, so I was the only one who said something about him. I just said he was a nice grandfather and that I’ll miss him a lot. 

 My family was grieving and I could see how his death was affecting them. That’s when things got to the point I described in the beginning. My mom, full of bald spots, my dad, looking like a scared puppy, my sister, looking like a caveman. I couldn’t bare it anymore.

 After some weeks, I went to visit Samuel. The mental facility wasn’t that far from our home, maybe three miles or so. When I got there and asked the staff about him, they said he’d already got out. At that moment, I got pale. I rarely got desperate, but I felt my heart racing inside of my chest. I asked them about who had picked him up, and they told me it was his grandfather.

 Austin? Austin took him? Yes, they said, and gave me some papers that he signed in. Two days ago. 

 Two days ago, Austin came here, took Samuel, and left. How can he be alive? Who was found dead in the basement? Did he murdered someone just so he could run away with Sam? Nothing made sense. I felt dizzy and could feel vomit filling up my mouth, but I swallowed.

 The staff took me to his room so I could take some stuff he left behind because they were “in a hurry”. The walls were full of nail marks and weird drawings. It all seemed just like random doodles, until I looked at the wall right over his bed. It was our family. We were all stick figures, but I could see what he meant with each stroke of the pencil he held.
My mother had almost no hair besides a few strands. Her left leg was missing. She was crying, holding my father by the hand, which was bloody. He was bald and had blood dripping from his head. His body was curved like it was broken. My sister had no head, just hair. She wore a dress and had bite marks on it. In the middle, it was him. He was shining, had a beautiful smile on his face and drew himself with red clothes, something the others had not. On his right, there he was. Austin. He was disturbingly tall. He held a big knife in his hand and was petting Sam with the other hand. He had a gigantic fucking grin on his face, and looked directly at me. And then I noticed I wasn’t present in the drawing. Why wasn’t I there? Was Samuel trying to protect me or ignore my existence? 

 Before I left, I looked through some of his drawers, and found a black notebook. When I opened it, the first thing I saw was a drawing of me. I could see he made it with effort. He drew my black hair, my blue eyes, my dimples and even drew the rose tattoo I have on the side of my neck. That really made me smile. Then, I read a couple more pages. He talked about how his grandfather was coming to pick him up and that they would finally get free. He talked about how he hated his father, his mother and his sister, and how he was thankful for what his grandfather was doing for him. He said he loved me. 

 I tried digging more into the diary, but I couldn’t find anything more than that. I got worried as fuck because how was he doing all of this while he had this severe case of dementia? How did he plan all of this with Samuel if he couldn’t even leave his house? How many times did he visit Samuel? I had no clue. 

 I decided that I’d just sleep inside my car for a week and see if they’d come during the night. The first day, nothing happened. The second day, nothing happened either. The third day, I wanted to give up. But at the fourth night, I saw them, but Austin definitely had something wrong with him. He was weirdly tall, like a light pole. He was extremely skinny, and his arms were big enough that he held Samuel by the hand. I know that’s a weird thing to do, but I started desperately pinching myself in case this was all a bad dream. Of course this did nothing, this was real, but it being real just makes everything I believe in fall apart. I’m a very skeptical guy, not a lot of things impress me, but seeing grandpa that way just made me want to kill myself right inside of that car, but I didn’t. I just kept staring, not even caring if they’d see me.

 Samuel was wearing a red raincoat, just like the drawing suggested. He hugged my grandfather’s giant leg, and his grin grew even more. Austin looked terrifying, how could Samuel ignore that? Couldn’t he see it? I don’t know. Everything seemed so absurd. 

 They stopped in front of the door and stood there for a while. Austin tried to push the door, and it opened smoothly as if a breeze of wind hit it. Samuel and Austin went inside on their tiptoes like some kind of fucking joke, and then disappeared inside our house. I was still mesmerized. I thought of running away, really, and that’s not something I’m proud of. I could just start the car and go away to another town, or even another country, I wasn’t in Samuel’s drawing, they probably wouldn’t hurt me. And I did turn the car on, but something whispered in my ear to go inside. This just got stuck in my head and I had to do something. 

 I kept a gun inside the glove box just in case I saw them. I took it and then walked towards the house on my tiptoes, just like them, and got inside.

 The entrance was clean, no signal of anything. I kept walking slowly until I saw the living room. 
 They were all there. Mother, father, sister, Samuel, “Austin”. My family were all on their knees, while Samuel and Austin were standing up, but Austin got even worse. Now, his eyes were wide with red veins popping all around the sclera. His mouth had bigger, crooked teeth and his lips were as red as blood. His hands got bigger and his nails were sharp. His ribs were sticking out even more, and his whole body had black veins running through. Samuel seemed okay with him. 

 “Samuel, who do you want to punish first?”

 Punish? 

 “Mom sent me away to that bad place where people hurt me! Kill mommy, kill!” said Samuel, without a doubt on his face. Was he possessed too, or what? 

 Austin stepped in front of my mother. She was terrified, just like me. Her nose dripping snot, her mouth full of saliva, her pupils shivering. The monster looked at her, opened up a big smile and, out of nowhere, his mouth opened absurdly, making my mother scream of terror. I saw the light on her eyes go away, as she slowly shrank. Austin grabbed her with his giant hands and pushed her down his throat. It made me puke almost instantly. I could see a bump as she got to his stomach, like when a snake eats something bigger than it should. She went through the throat, then through the ribs, and finally, to the stomach. He seemed so satisfied, and Samuel laughed while it happened. My sister passed out on the floor, and my father pissed himself. My brother and my grandfather both laughed as it was funny. All I could think about was what the hell would happen after he ate all of them.

 “I want the next one to be my sister. She is mean to me, and she told me that she was grandpa’s favorite!” said Samuel, childishly. He really thought that killing all of his family members because of some mean comments was fine. That didn’t sit right to me. But I was paralyzed. I couldn’t move, nor shout. I felt like the worst person ever.

 Austin did the same with my sister, but he woke her up before doing it. He sucked the life out of her eyes, just like he did to my mother, and every time his mouth got larger and his teeth got sharper. He didn’t just swallow her, like he did to my mother. He put her whole body inside of his mouth, but kept her head out, and then started to bite her. An avalanche of blood dripped from his mouth as he tore up her whole body. She screamed in agony, but after a few seconds, she died. My father squealed like a pig, crying and begging for his life. Austin spat my sister on the floor, making her body look just like minced meat. My father threw up.

 “My dad is the worst. He punched me in the face and didn’t protect me from the mental hospital. I want him to suffer, grandpa!”

 That made Austin even more excited. He, then, stretched out his hand, and with just one fingernail, cut my father’s left arm. He screamed in agony, and I fell on the ground, my whole body asking for help, but again, I couldn’t move. Austin cut his right arm too, and ate them both. Then, it was time for the legs. But instead of cutting, he ripped both of them slowly. My father couldn’t even scream anymore, he just breathed fastly and loudly, while his body got covered in blood. Austin’s mouth dripped with saliva as he swallowed my father’s legs. He was almost dead, but before he did, Austin cut his body in half. His organs spilled on the floor as he gave his last breath. Samuel proceeded to hug Austin’s leg as he stroked my brother’s hair. It was over. He killed all of them. What was next?

 “I think we forgot one”, said Austin, looking at me with that fucking bloody grin on his face. The worst part is that he still looked just like my grandfather.

 “No, grandpa, I told you he didn’t do anything wrong”, said Samuel, running towards me.

 Sam hugged me. I was sitting on the floor, mesmerized, until that hug pulled me back to reality. I held him with all the strength I had, but Austin pulled him by the back of his raincoat. I got up and asked Samuel what the fuck was happenning.

 “Grandfather is helping me to punish our family, just like they always punished us!”, said Samuel, proudly, while he held Austin’s giant finger.

 I told him this wasn’t our grandfather, and that he was a dangerous being. I opened my arms and told him we should leave.
 “I am your grandfather”, said Austin, “I’ve always been inside of him.”

 And that fucking blew my mind. This is why my brother was always so close to him, he was being tricked.

 “Your grandfather wanted to be a charming man, so I made him, and his whole family, too. But, after this much time, I had to take my place”. 
 Now, try to picture that. Your grandfather, 10 feet tall, possessed by a demon and talking with a deep, gross voice. That’s definitely something you’d take a long time to recover from. And there I was, right in front of this picture.

 I told Samuel to come with me, but he refused. He just stood there on his side, holding that fucking fingernail.

 Instinctively, I took the gun out of my pocket and shot that fucking monster in the belly, and his stomach exploded, making my dad’s parts and my whole mom to fall on the floor. They were covered in some kind of dark green mucus. Austin fell on the floor on his back, screaming in agony. Samuel started crying and screaming, begging me to stop. I ran towards the monster and started shooting him everywhere, on the face, on the heart, everywhere. Samuel was pulling me by my shirt while I killed that evil fucking thing. Austin wasn’t moving, and started deflating like a balloon. I took an empty plant pot that was sitting next to us and broke it on his face, and used a sharp piece to cut my way into his heart. I managed to take it out of the body by breaking the ribcage. 

 There I was, sitting over my dead grandfather’s monstrous body. I closed my eyes for a second, relieved, and when I opened them again, my grandfather looked the same as he ever did, but with an open chest and a lot of stretched bullet holes. I thought for a moment that killing him made the demon vanish or something, but I couldn’t be more wrong. When I looked behind me, Samuel had foam on his mouth and trembled a lot, like he was having an epilepsy attack or something. I ran towards him, shaking his body in despair, hoping for him to be okay. 

 We stayed there for a while, until Samuel opened his eyes, finally. I started crying like a little baby when I realized he was alright. He hugged me back.

 “Brother! Thank you for saving me!”, said Samuel, as he held me close. 

 We got up and we looked at the living room full of bodies and blood. 

 “What do we do now?” asked Samuel.

 I told him that we should just leave. We could go to another country. Didn’t matter, we just needed to go as far away as we could. So, we both headed for the door.

 That’s when I realized something was off about Samuel. I just sensed it. Something in my head was telling me to kill him. Maybe that fucking demon that possessed my grandfather could be inside of my brother.

 I took the gun out of my pocket again. I started crying silently as he walked towards the door. I had one bullet still, and pointed the gun exactly to his head.

 “Aren’t you coming, big br…” and then, I shot him. His head exploded in millions of pieces right in front of me. His blood on my face, on my clothes, on everything, but I did what I could. I looked at the mirror for a brief second, and then, I noticed I had a teeth that was too big for my mouth. A sharp, yellow, crooked teeth. My reflection winked at me.

 I fell on the ground, screaming in agony. He wasn’t the one possessed, I was. This fucking monster tricked my into killing my baby brother. 

 I crawled towards his cadaver and hugged his headless body, caressing his soft, little arms. I stayed there for hours, until I fell asleep.

 I woke up with a police officer poking me with the tip of his boot. And that’s all I remember about the day I was arrested.

 I wrote all of this in my notebook during my time in prison, since I’d have to stay here for the rest of my life. I was accused of murdering my whole family, except my grandfather, because his body fucking vanished out of the crime scene. In my country, the death penalty isn’t legal, just to be clear.

 I ran away. Me and my cellmates sewed our cell and managed to escape in the middle of the night because of a fight happening in a cell nearby that drew the whole attention. We all ran away through a rotten part of the fence.

 I’m currently sitting inside of an abandoned prison, which is ironic, in the middle of the woods, using a cellphone I stole from a passerby. I knew about this subreddit and just thought that this was the right place to share my story. I know they’re gonna catch me someday, so I need to share my side of the story before it’s too late.

 I’m still possessed by this demon, but he can’t control me for some reason, but he can make me hallucinate. I saw each one of my family members multiple times while writing this post. He’s torturing me, and I don’t know how long I can take this.

 Don’t let my story die. If i get arrested again, this will forever be my testimony. The proof of my innocence.

 I’m breaking this cell phone so no one can find my location, so I won’t be answering anyone (owner of the account, I know I robbed you, but please don’t delete this).

 I hope this never happens to anyone else. 

 Wish me luck.
