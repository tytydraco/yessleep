It started as a stupid accident. I was slicing chicken late at night, half watching some YouTube video, when the knife slipped. A deep, clean slice across my left palm. I remember the sound before the pain a sickening shhk through skin and tendon.

I swore, dropped the knife, and clutched my hand. Blood poured out fast. I wrapped it in a towel, called urgent care, and drove myself with one hand. They stitched it up ten tight black threads, and the doctor said it would heal fine. “Come back in a week. Keep it clean.”

That was three weeks ago.
It still hasn’t closed.
Worse..it’s wider now.

I kept it clean. Washed it carefully. Applied antibiotic cream. But every time I unwrapped the bandage, the wound looked wrong. Not infected just… open. Like the skin had forgotten how to grow.

I went back to urgent care. A different doctor this time. He looked at the wound, frowned.

“Strange. Did you reopen it?”

“No,” I said. “It just won’t close.”

He re-stitched it tighter this time and gave me stronger antibiotics. I followed every instruction.

Five days later, I woke up to my bedsheets sticky with blood.

The stitches had burst. The wound looked hungry the skin on either side pulling apart, like it wanted to gape open. The meat inside looked darker. Not infected. Different. Like something was moving just below the surface.

I didn’t go back.

Something about the way the doctors touched it how quickly they backed away, how they exchanged glances told me they didn’t want to see it again either.

Instead, I kept it covered. Started filming it, watching it. Every night. Same setup: lights off, infrared camera from my job (I do AV installs), lens fixed on my hand while I slept.

I didn’t expect to catch anything.

The first night, nothing happened.

The second night, I twitched and turned, scratched at it in my sleep.

The third night, something came out.

It was just a frame or two. Had to go frame by frame to see it. A dark, thin shape almost like a spider leg poked out of the wound. Then another. Then they slipped back in. The video ended with me mumbling in my sleep and rolling over.

I watched it ten times.

That wasn’t a dream.

The wound pulsed around the edges, like it welcomed whatever that was.

I haven’t been able to sleep since. I keep watching it, keep recording. Every night the thing comes out for longer. On Thursday, I saw what looked like a face small, featureless, gray, no eyes press up against the inside of my hand. Like it was testing the boundary.

It stared up at me from the inside of my own fucking flesh.

I’ve started hearing whispers at night. They come from inside the walls at first, but eventually they settle around me, like static building inside my skull. It’s always the same voice:

“Let it open. Let me out.”

Sometimes I dream I’m holding hands with myself except the other me is hollow, and something is shifting behind his eyes. In the dream, he says: “You split the veil. We never forgot.”

I don’t know what that means. I’m not religious, not spiritual, not into weird rituals or shit. I just… cut my hand. That’s all.

But I think whatever I cut into wasn’t just me.

Last night, the wound reached my wrist. It didn’t bleed. It just unzipped, smooth and silent. Skin curled outward like pages peeling back. There’s no pain anymore. Just a low vibration like my hand is a tuning fork for something old and far away.

I saw bones mine but they were moving. Rearranging. Making room.

For what, I don’t know. But it’s getting closer to the elbow now.

I can’t go to a hospital. I know they’ll cut the arm off, and I think… I think it’ll keep growing anyway. It doesn’t want out of my arm. It wants out of here.

If anyone reads this, listen to me

Don’t cut too deep.
Don’t let your wounds stay
Because once it gets out, I don’t think it’ll go.
