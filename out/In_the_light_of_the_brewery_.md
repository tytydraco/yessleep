I’ve never slept well.


For as long as I can remember night would come and I would lay there staring at the ceiling. My mind whirs and spins, it dissects every choice I’ve ever made. My legs tighten and burn, as restless as me.


The doctor told me years ago stress kept me awake and something called restless leg syndrome made it worse.


“Develop a routine, turn off the TV, brush your teeth, close the curtains, and count backwards from 100, once you begin to drift off try not to move at all.”


That had been the advice she had given me.


But what happens when I get to 0 and I’m still awake?


Or when I begin to drift off and my calves start itching like I’m standing in a bed of nettles?


I resolved myself to the fact that true rest just wasn’t on the cards for me. So now I lie awake, I read, or watch telly, or at my mind's request, I review my existence up to now. 27 years in a night. From the moment my love drifts off until my body finally surrenders to its circadian rhythms.


What would have happened if I had agreed to go to the country leading all boys secondary school, rather than the one my friends were going to?


What if I had picked a different career?


Why didn’t I say a clever line when that kid mocked my hair in year 5?


It all burns and roars and crashes behind my eyes.


Tonight will I distract myself and ignore the noise, or will I descend into the cacophony of errors, regrets, and moments that reawaken, twisted and monstrous in these twilight hours?


These nights are made easier by my love. I do not think she realises the comfort that she brings in the dark. Her soft snores anchoring my soul.


We have lived her for nearly 3 years. In our flat. Our home.


We are on the third floor of the building, overlooking the river and beyond it the bustling city centre. On the opposite bank sits the brewery.


An enormous building of concrete and glass, it dominates the skyline like a hulking giant dozing by the water.


Its floodlights seem to have been arranged to illuminate the rear wall of our bedroom. Casting shadows that loom across the length of the room, settling upon the door.


I watch the shadows while my mind works, eventually falling into fitful sleep.


When I wake I do not feel rested, bleary eyed and thirsty I stumble through the first half hour of my day.


Any dreams I may have had do not linger. When the sun rises they dissolve away like the shadows on the walls. Often my love will ask what happened in my dreams and I will stare back glassy eyed before reminding her that I don’t dream.


But she knows different, some nights I will wake her as I speak, or challenge an invisible intruder, or leave the bed and make my way to the kitchen, or worse the balcony.


She is gentle but firm and will lead me back into the safety of the duvet.


These events will be wiped from my memory by morning, but not from her’s. It scares her, and that scares me.


The nights have been different recently.


My mind has stopped showing me the past, now it boils slowly in fear.


The shadows have begun to move.


I cannot remember when I first noticed the change, but every night is now the same. I lie motionless, counting backwards in my head staring at the corner of the room.


Between the bedroom door and the en-suite, amongst the dressing gowns and hoodies something stirs.


I know nothing is there. Only darkness. I have checked in the night, and shined a torch and watched it like a hawk, nothing.


Only the darkness, and the shapes hanging on the door.


But I cannot shake the feeling of eyes.

I have noticed the darkness and it has noticed me.


This evening is the same. We go through our routine, we laugh and joke, and watch cartoons, and cuddle and say we love each other, and she drifts off.

I begin my watch.


The shadows haven’t changed yet, they’re still the soft, grey, dressing gown with the torn pocket that she had bought me for Christmas two years ago and her light blue running jacket.


But they will come, the shadows. I know they will.


I turn the TV back on, house renovations videos on YouTube to soothe my restless mind.


After an hour I feel myself relaxing, I’m sinking into the mattress and Morpheus has slipped into my dreams.


That’s when I see it, from the corner of my eye, through the crack in the door. The shadows coalescing, binding, into their monstrous form.


I am halfway into sleep, my body has mostly shut down, but my eyes are open and my mind is screaming.


I can feel my chest tightening, my heart is pounding in my ears, and sweat rolls across my head. The comfort of the mattress is gone; it's now like the ceiling has collapsed pinning me to the bed.


The malevolent presence in the hallway stares into my soul. I can see it reaching for the door, tendrils of darkness slipping through the gap.


She is between us.


A figure under the duvet, gently snoring, blissfully unaware of the danger reaching out.


Everything in me is screaming at my legs.


Move, for God’s sake move!


It makes no sound, pressing a head like shape through the door, it has no features but I feel its grin. Whatever it is, it’s enjoying my struggle.


For what feels like hours I try to wrench myself out of the bed.


It’s so close now. It’s nearly through the gap.


Suddenly, my leg jerks wildly up and I’m falling.


I clatter through my bedside table, bouncing off the big chest of drawers, and spin onto the ground. Before my body hits the floor I’m driving myself back up and I’m launching myself into the space between her and the door.


But there is nothing there, only darkness. The door is unmoved, my dressing gown its familiar grey in the lights of the brewery.


“What’s happening? Are you ok?”


The fear in her voice breaks me from my trance.


“I’m alright, sorry. Must’ve been a bad dream.”


I kiss her and she goes back to sleep.


My shoulder aches from my collision with the drawers, I restore my bedside table to its rightful place and climb back into bed.


It takes a while, but I begin to drift off as the sun starts to rise.


I watch the shadows retreat, but I can still feel their presence.


The shadow people are patient, I know I will see them soon.
