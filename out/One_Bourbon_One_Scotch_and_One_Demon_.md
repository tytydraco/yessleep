I looked up from my glass of whiskey to notice the cute blond girl staring at me from across the bar.  I had been eyeing her all night hoping she would notice me.  Unfortunately, her statuesque poise and piercing blue eyes gazing into the depths of my soul were not the indicator of interest I so solemnly hoped for. 

 

When I say statuesque, I mean she literally resembled a fucking statue, unmoving and unbreathing.  In fact, nobody in the bar was moving, even the bartender was still holding an upturned Jack Daniels bottle aimed towards a shot glass, the liquid contents coming out stayed frozen in time like an icicle just inches from the glass. 

 

I wasn’t alone though, and while I stared straight ahead at the bar full of numerous frozen bodies stuck in gestures and poses of their previous cheerful time, I could feel the intense wave of heat radiating from my right.  The seat next to me was empty all night, but now something was there. 

 

If anyone could have looked at me there in that moment, I might have not looked that different from the frozen individuals all around me, I stayed staring straight ahead of me because I was panicking on the inside.  I didn’t want to look to my right, I was scared at the thought of what found me on this fateful night and what it would do to me.  I thought if I just pretended to stay frozen like everything else it would just leave me alone, but I was wrong.  It was then it started to talk to me.

 

“*Are you done pretending to be frozen yet?  I don’t much like drinking alone*.”  The thing next to me said.

 

Every word it spoke blared into my ears like a deep baritone commanding my attention followed by an aftershock of slithering words crawling into my ears hissing and repeating the same thing with a sense of annoyance that I wouldn’t adhere to its presence.  My head started pounding like it was going to burst, the feeling of needles sticking into every area of my skin pierced my sensations and caused tears to stream down my eyes and cry out in pain.

 

And then all the pain just stopped.  The voice spoke again but it sounded less hostile and more appropriate to human ears.  It said to look at him, or the pain could come back in ways I couldn’t imagine.  I wiped the tears from my eyes and did something I had not done since I was a child, I asked God to forgive me for anything I had done, and I turned my head to look at the presence. 

 

It wasn’t the black jeans or black shoes it was wearing I found off putting.  It also wasn’t the red knit long sleeve thermal shirt it was wearing or the black wool overcoat hanging around it.  The skin tone was fair and the hair was short and blonde that decorated its head, none of which was off putting as well at the first glance.  At a second glance it was very off putting, it looked just like me.  It was like I was staring at myself in a mirror almost, except my shirt was white. 

 

Then there were the eyes, perhaps the most off-putting thing that scared me to my core, they were just black.  No pupils, just black eyes that pierced me, there are no words to describe what it felt like to stare at those.  My mind raced through fear and question as my consciousnesses struggled to understand what was happening.  The thing before me sensed this as it sat relaxed in the barstool with a glass of whiskey it sipped on. 

 

As I recollect my memory of the night, I’ll just say that the entity spoke for the duration of the night.  The corresponding conversation is as follows below. 

 

“*I can hear your thoughts quite well so there’s no need to speak, I never much liked the sound you animals made as your vocal cords evolved throughout the years.  Who am I?  I hear this running through your head but you already know my old friend.”*

 

*“Remember when you begged your mom not to leave you alone at night as a child in your bedroom?  You’d slowly drift asleep as she gently caressed your hair, and all of a sudden, you’d wake up screaming for her in the middle of the night realizing she left you all alone with the monster under your bed.”* 

 

It made a deep laugh to itself while licking its lips before taking another sip of the whiskey and continuing. 

 

“*If I recall correctly, you’d bury your eyes in the pillow right when you woke up sobbing.  You’d yell for mommy and wait for her to come in and caress your hair again, crying about the monster under your bed that wanted to eat you.”* 

 

*“And you were right, I was there the whole time listening.  In fact, you were too young to realize your mother was a crack addict.  She couldn’t wake up to your screams even if a gangbang ran right through her, which they did as you cried for her.”*

 

*“That was me caressing your hair in the middle of the night, me gently whispering to you to fall asleep.  All those dreams of safety you had shortly after in vain as I sat drinking in that intoxicating fear that surrounded you as your subconscious took over, licking your face as you slept.”*

 

Thoughts raced in my mind as tears flooded my eyes staring at the being in front of me.  Its piercing eyes studied me like a science project, but grinning with a sick fetish for the toxins my brain was releasing.  It loved it, it fed off it.  It took a sip from the whiskey glass and slid it across to me on the bar. 

 

“*You’re saying my name in your head, well one them at least.  You want me to say it for you to settle your disbelief, but that would just be so boring, wouldn’t it?  I like hearing you convince yourself I’m just an apparition of your guilt for decisions you’ve made, it quite tickles me actually. If it makes you feel better, you can think of me as an angel.  Theoretically I never stopped being one, although I find the term a bit too conservative for my taste.  Challenging the status quo is what made me, and one third of the boys upstairs, a new home we call Hell.”* 

 

*“Before I tell you why I am here, yes, I can hear you asking if I can smell that you’ve pissed yourself, it’s ok, you’re not the first to do that.  Yea, it’s a little annoying but I’ve seen worse.”*

 

At this point, the devil before me slid the entire bottle of Whiskey down the bar to me and refused to go any further until I downed at least 2 gulps of it, claiming if I didn’t calm the burning questions in my head, it would smash the bottle across it instead.  It also claimed that it knew of the questionable gay porn which populated my browser, which for the record I will say was not from my doing, but because my computer was hacked at the time. 

 

After 2 gulps the entity continued its conversation.

 

“*So now that you’re a little calmer, as close as it can be, you’ll be surprised to know that your actually quite a celebrity in Hell.  Actually, myself included, we are all big fans of yours.  You are quite the artist and inspiration.  I was there when it started, the night your mother over dosed after telling you she was going to get you candy from the store, she actually went to your deadbeat dads house for a fix, it’s too bad he still found the time to have his way with her after she overdosed before calling the cops, but yea that’s not important, you probably knew that already.”* 

 

*“That night you picked up a paint set lying around your room, you found a dead rat close to it, and knowing the red paint was missing from that set you made no delay in finding a replacement.  It was at that moment I saw the artist in you.  You were raw talent born in sin and negligence, a born bastard out of wedlock, God would have casted you to me anyway like a gift.”*

 

*“So, you know what I did that night?  I told a few of my boys to keep an eye on you, and make sure you got into the right foster care, made sure you were put into a decent family that would give you a good education.  You thrived!  You went to college, became a doctor and perfected your talent.”*

 

*“Most kids from your upbringing would have just ended their life out of depression, but you channeled those misgivings to create art amongst the world.  Ill just tell you, my personal favorite is the work you did on your father, seeing him crawl with no limbs across the floor for 3 days is something we all still laugh about in Hell to this day.”*

 

*“Ohh, and let’s not forget about the medical school student who failed out that you lured to that motel with a plan you had to get her back in.  I mean the things you did to her uterus while she was paralyzed but still conscious, definitely makes me see the artistic expression of how you felt about your mother, I almost shed a tear at the beauty thinking about it.”*

 

*“You’ve been getting some doubt in the back of your mind lately as to if you’re a monster, I also hear in your thoughts you’ve regretted this, well I am here to tell you that that is rubbish.  I support you fully and just wanted to let you know you have my full support in your endeavors, wipe those negative thoughts from your mind son, you’re an artist.”*

 

*“I saw you looking at that cute blond girl at the bar tonight, let me clear the doubt in your head, yes you deserve the night with her.  She has about 3 years until she dies of ovarian cancer honestly, so just go through your calculated plans to fulfil your mommy fetish and recycle her meat to the homeless, don’t see any issues there.”*

 

*“Now that you seem calmer knowing you have my approval, why I am really here is to tell you that the cops are on to you.  No, don’t freak out, we have plenty of cops in our debt we can call in favors, but that won’t really do an ounce of good if you don’t get that fucking femur bone out of the trunk of your car.  Yes, I know you didn’t know it was there, that’s why I am fucking here.  Look, Ill just wait here at the bar, and you can just drive on back home while everything is still, dispose of that evidence in your trunk, and meet me back here and everything will be just right, and that blond hair cutie, whose name is Camille by the way, will be waiting for you right when you get back.  Get to it.”*

 

At that point I left the bar and drove home, disposed of what was revealed to me.  I am typing this before I drive back to the bar as the world stands still.  The most shocking thing about this night to me so far is the red knit long sleeve shirt the entity was wearing.  I had the same shirt, but discovered it was missing from my house just now.  I just find it horrific that an ever present being would take my shirt.
