The intercom buzzed, crackling into life.

"Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking. It seems like we are going to encounter some slight turbulence. The seatbelt light is going to turn on, and I strongly suggest for you to lift your tray table."

I quickly lifted my tray table to the back of the seat in front of me, locking it into position. I looked over to the person seated next to me, who was sleeping on their tray table. I decided to let them be.

A couple of minutes later, the airplane began to rumble and sway from side to side. I relaxed into my chair. The turbulence wasn't too bad- I had experienced much worse before. I hopped on my phone, looking to kill some time, when the intercom buzzed again. The voice coming from it was quieter this time, so much so that I had to strain to hear it.

"Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking. The turbulence will continue for the next minute or so. Please focus on the turbulence."

*What did he say?* I thought to myself. *I must have misheard him.*

The plane began to rock more heavily now, the wings dipping from side to side, causing the passengers to shuffle in their seats. My neighbour, however, somehow still slept. The lights began to flicker on and off, which I assumed was a side effect of the stronger than normal turbulence.

The intercom buzzed again.

"Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking. You may notice some strange occurrences due to the malfunctioning lights. This is not important. Please focus on the turbulence."

The seatbelt light turned off.

The swaying of the airplane increased in intensity, staying on one side for longer periods of time, and causing the plane to practically fly sidewards. Gravity started to pull me down, causing me to push against the sleeping passenger next to me. The lights continued to flicker more irregularly, switching between on and off seemingly at random. I heard muffled yells emanating from the back, and so I craned my head in that direction to see what was going on.

There was a person. Walking up the aisle.

They were pushing along a beverage cart, standing perfectly straight even though it seemed impossible. The person came to halt every few rows, and seemed to whisper something to the obviously terrified passengers, before moving on again.

As the person moved forwards I could I begin to make out that they were wearing a flight attendant's uniform, just as you would see on any plane. The flight attendant made their way forwards to another row, and again whispered something to a man sitting on the aisle seat. The man looked up at the flight attendant, and said something that I couldn't make out.

The flight attendant smiled and nodded, before turning too take something out of her beverage cart, that somehow didn't rattle or shake despite the turbulence. I watched curiously as she started to pull various items out of her cart.

The intercom buzzed.

"Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking. Apologies for the extreme turbulence. Please do not talk to any of our staff for the time being. Just focus on the turbulence. Thank you for your patience."

In a blur of motion, a fork was stabbed into the man's eye and pulled back out, carrying the eye with it. The man slumped over, blood pooling at his feet. And the flight attendant stuck the fork in her mouth, and began to chew the eye.

There was a couple of moments of stunned silence before all hell broke loose.

Passengers were taking their seatbelts off, and scrambling over each other to get away from the flight attendant, spilling into the aisles. Due to the turbulence they began to roll forward to the front of the plane. I winced as I heard bones break and tendons snap as the mass of humanity rolled forward.

The intercom buzzed.

"Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking. Please do not get out of your seats. All ongoings on this plane are to be ignored. Focus on the turbulence and keep your gaze forward. The plane should stabilize sometime soon."

The airplane swung to the other side, now resting completely on a vertical line. And yet the flight attendant continued forwards, completely unfazed by the current position of the plane and the bodies that littered the aisles. The lights continued to flicker and faze as she got closer, and the flight attendant came to a stop at my aisle.

She looked me in the eyes, blood splattered over her uniform. "Would you like refreshments?" She asked.

I sat in silent fear, my whole body shivering as the flight attendant stood staring at me. I remained facing forward, not trusting myself make a sound, and opted to focus on the turbulence instead.

My seat neighbour chose now to wake up, however.

He looked at the flight attendant, and in a half-sleepy state asked for a coffee with two sugars. The flight attendant smiled, showing rows of blood-stained teeth.

"Of course, sir."

I had just seen someone get their eyes pulled out, but up closer it was so much worse.

I fought the instinctive urge to gag as the flight attendant ripped the passengers eyes out of their sockets and ate them with a muffled *pop*. The flight attendant smiled at me again before continuing forward, accompanied by the swaying of the plane and flickering of the lights.

The intercom buzzed.

"Attention all passengers, this is your captain speaking. It seems like the turbulence has stopped for now. I recommend for you all to stay in you seats for the remainder of this flight, as we clean up the aisles. Thank you for flying with us and choose us next time."

That wasn't going to [happen](https://www.reddit.com/r/ineedabettersub/).
