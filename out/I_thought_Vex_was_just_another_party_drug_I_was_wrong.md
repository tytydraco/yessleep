My friends are probably dead, but it’s not my fault.  I just want to get that out of the way up front.  You’ll say I shouldn’t have gone along with it.  Maybe you’ll say I could have helped them.  But it wasn’t my idea, and I didn’t know what was happening until it was too late.

So give a guy a break.  I’m telling you this so it doesn’t happen to *you*.

I don’t remember the name of the party we went to that night.  The police are sure that means I’m hiding something, but honestly, we went to so many parties that they all kind of blend together.  Even when we talked about them, we never called them by name.  It was always “Hey, remember the party where that naked guy fell through the roof?” or “Remember the one where Jazz stole Keoki’s bathrobe?”  It was easier than trying to keep track of who played at what venue on what day, especially since we weren’t always coherent while things were going on.  I mean, it’s a party after all.

There were six of us packed into the car that night: me, Jazz, Hula, Candi, Tommy, and this girl Rachel that Tommy invited at the last minute.  Tommy was driving his SUV, Baby.  Tommy always drove, no matter whose vehicle we took or where we were going.  Said he couldn’t handle putting his life in someone else’s hands.  I know that doesn’t make a whole lot of sense, since he regularly risked his life buying and taking drugs at parties, but when you’ve known someone as long as I’ve known Tommy you sort of take their quirks for granted.  Besides, he’s never gotten a ticket or been in an accident. Which is more than I can say for the rest of us.

Anyway, it was this huge desert party, and we had a bunch of stuff crammed into the trunk because we were planning on spending the night out there afterward.  Candi and Jazz were really hyped because they were supposed to meet up with one of the DJs between sets-- some girl from New York, I think.  They were playing her latest mix in the car and it sounded like experimental acid house.  Not really my thing, but it was cool watching them get so excited.  Their good mood was wearing off on the rest of us, and even Hula was doing this weird sort of half-smile.  Hula hates desert parties.  She’s terrified of scorpions, and every time we go out there somebody has to convince her to just get out of the car and have a good time.

We got out there about a half hour before the music started.  Usually we like to show up a little late, but this was supposed to be a big party and we wanted to make sure we got our stuff set up before things got going.  Nobody wants to carry tents and blankets through the middle of a party in the dark.  So we chose a spot and I started setting up the tents while everybody else ran back and forth to the car to get all the soft toys, blankets, and coolers full of water and ice.  At some point Rachel ended up helping me nail the tent pegs in, and I finally had a chance to talk to her.

She was gorgeous, so I could see why Tommy liked her.  Long blond hair, tanned skin, a bright pink tanktop and a pair of tight jeans; she looked like she should be on her way to a sorority party, not hanging out with a bunch of ravers in the desert.  Then she told me she’d met Thomas-- *Thomas!*\-- in her sociology class, and I couldn’t help but laugh.  She laughed a little too, like it was totally obvious to her that she didn’t fit in and she didn’t care.  She told me that she was working on a paper about how psychoactive substances could “dissolve barriers between people of different subcultures”.  I took that to mean she had a thing for Tommy and wanted to roll with him, and I dropped it.  She seemed like a nice girl.

Finding the pills wasn’t hard.  We didn’t even have to go looking.  We finished setting up our roll station just as it got dark and the music began to pick up, so we walked around as a group for a while and checked out all the stages.  We made a slow circle and an hour later we were standing in front of the tents again, trying to figure out which stage to go to, when this little goth chick settled down on one of our blankets and gave us a big smile.  She was wearing black and white striped stockings and these crazy contacts that made it look like her eyes were solid red.  Pretty badass, but there was something about her I didn’t like. Not a cop thing. She was just… creepy. Like she didn’t belong at a desert party.  “You guys looking for anything?”

Jazz settled in next to her and started negotiating.  Jazz looked like a dork, with his giant glasses and overbite, but he was our party guy.  If you only had ten bucks and wanted to have a great night, Jazz could make it happen. After a couple of parties we’d learned to just give him the money and let him work.  After a couple of minutes he handed the girl most of the money we’d pooled, and she disappeared back into the dark.  He gave her a minute, then held up a little bag stuffed with pills.  His teeth flashed bright white in the dark. “Got it.”

We split the bag six ways.  There were two pills for everyone: a red Mitsubishi and a dark purple one without an imprint.  Jazz said the goth chick had called those “Vex”.  Apparently they were the new big thing.  The ‘ultimate high’. Everyone else was really excited to try them, but I tucked the Vex into my pocket.  I’d had Mitsubishis before and they were a long-lasting, energetic, cuddly dance pill.  That vibe was exactly what I was looking for, so I figured I’d take the Vex later, when the Mitsu started to peak. There’s a science to these things.

Everyone else headed off to the trance stage, and I talked Hula into coming out of the tent and going with me to see who else had shown up.  I didn’t even think about the Vex again until about eleven o’clock.  By then we had run into a couple of people we knew from past parties, and Hula was finally starting to relax and have a good time.  We’d heard a couple of amazing sets and the pills had definitely kicked in.

Hula slipped her hand into mine and gave me an enormous smile.  “I’m so happy,” she said, sounding like a little girl.  Her pupils were enormous and her dark eyes shone in the colored lights from the stage.  Her hair was tangled with sweat from the pills and the dancing, and her t-shirt was stained with it. I knew mine was, too, but we didn’t care.

“I know!” I laughed.  “That’s the point!”  I was grinning like a fool, feeling the music travel in waves up my legs and along my spine.

“You know what would be really great right now?  Let’s go back to the tent and get some water, and I’ll give you a backrub!”

We were halfway back to the tent when Hula started stumbling. At first it was just a couple of steps, and I thought she’d tripped over the rough ground. That’s one of the hazards of desert parties. But she was staggering like a drunk, her movements jerky and badly-timed, and eventually I had to throw my arm around her to make sure she wasn’t going to go face-down in the sand. It made me laugh, but she was kind of heavy. Hula’s a big girl.

“Sorry,” she said, and her words were slurry but kind of bright, like she was still smiling through them. I hugged her and slid one of my bracelets over her hand: the silver beads with the blue stars that said “MUSIC”. She grinned at me.

That’s when we heard the screaming.  There was a big crowd of people gathered around the jungle stage, so we couldn’t see what was going on, but it sounded like somebody up front had either gotten hurt or was having a *really* bad trip.  Still holding hands, Hula and I pushed through the crowd to see what had happened. Everyone moved out of the way, though it still took a minute to get through all of them.

At first I couldn’t understand what I was seeing.  There was this guy hunched over on the ground, holding his face, and this girl in fairy wings standing over him.  It was her doing most of the screaming, but the guy was making plenty of noise of his own.  Something dark dripped from his face, and at first I thought he was throwing up.  Then I realized the blood was coming from his eyes.  He was still clawing at them.  I shuddered and stepped back, pulling Hula by the hand.  She stared at me for a second, then said seriously, “I wonder what he saw.”

“Who gives a shit?” I said, trying to pull her away from the stage, but she wouldn’t budge. She just kept staring at the guy, her mouth slightly open like she was seeing something I wasn’t. I gave her arm a gentle tug. “Hula, come on.”

She turned to look at me, her pupils still blown wide, but something in her smile was weird. It was lopsided, like she was trying to remember how to use her face. I felt a cold knot form in my stomach.

The screaming stopped all at once, like someone had flipped a switch. A few people gasped. The guy on the ground was completely still now, his face turned away from us. The girl in the fairy wings staggered back, her hands pressed to her mouth. I thought she was going to scream again, but she didn’t. Instead she backed into me, and I could hear her muttering, “It’s not real. It’s not real.”

I didn’t want to be there anymore. Hula still wasn’t moving, though, and I was starting to freak out. I grabbed her by her shoulders and tried to turn her around. “Hula! We’re leaving!”

She blinked slowly, like I’d just awakened her from a nap, and nodded. “Yeah. Okay.” Her voice was soft and sluggish, but at least she started walking when I tried to guide her back to the tent.

I did look back to see if anybody was helping the guy on the ground. The crowd around the jungle stage was breaking up, but nobody was getting close to him. He looked like a mannequin someone had thrown into the dirt, arms bent at wrong angles, face shiny and wet in the light from the stage lights.

It was the first time I’d noticed his lips. They were moving.

Getting Hula back to the tent was like dragging a half-asleep toddler through a crowded mall. She kept stumbling, mumbling under her breath, half-singing the songs from the stages we passed. I didn’t think she was even talking to me.

When we finally reached the tent, I pushed her inside and zipped up the flaps behind us. The rest of the group was already back, sprawled across the blankets and pillows and stuffies we’d brought. At first glance, they seemed okay: Jazz was lying on his back, humming to himself, and Candi was curled up with her head in Tommy’s lap while he pet her hair. Rachel was sitting cross-legged in the corner, staring down at the flashing glow toy in her lap like it held all the secrets of the universe.

Then I noticed the twitches.

Jazz’s fingers were tapping a frantic, uneven rhythm against the blankets. Candi’s head was jerking slightly, like she couldn’t hold still. Rachel’s breath came in short, uneven bursts, and she wasn’t blinking at all.

“What the hell is going on?” I said, more to myself than to anyone else. 

Tommy looked up at me, his eyes glassy and unfocused, his hands still ceaselessly stroking Candi’s long pink hair. “Bad batch,” he said, speaking slowly and carefully, as though he had forgotten how. “It… happens. Just got to ride it out.” 

“This isn’t just a bad batch.” I crouched down next to him. “I’m not trying to ruin anyone’s vibes, but did you see that guy by the stage? Something is seriously wrong.”

Tommy blinked at me, then looked over at Rachel and smiled. “You’re just freaking out, man. Everything’s fine.”

“Fine?” I gestured to Hula, who’d collapsed on a pile of blankets with her arms thrown around a giant stuffed lizard. “She can barely walk!”

“It happens.” Candi’s voice was almost a whisper, and I could hear the effort it cost her to speak. Her head jerked back and forth in Tommy’s lap like she was having a seizure.

“Tommy, I think we need to go.”

Before he could answer, a scream tore through the tent. It was sharp and ragged, and it didn’t stop. It just kept going, on and on, like someone was being ripped apart piece by piece.

Rachel finally looked up, her head snapping toward the sound so fast it looked unnatural. Her lips peeled back from her teeth in a grin that showed her gums all the way around. “They’re here.”

I froze. “Who’s here?”

“Vex takes down… the barriers.”

“What the hell are you talking about? What barriers?”

Rachel didn’t answer. Instead, she tilted her head back, listening as the screams outside deteriorated into a wet gurgling. A second later, the tent shook. Rachel stood up unsteadily, the glow toy rolling out of her lap to land in front of Hula. From beneath the giant lizard, one brown arm emerged to snag the toy, then disappeared back into the blanket nest. Rachel shoved past me and pushed out through the tent doors. 

Jazz scrambled to his feet, his movements jerky and uncoordinated. “We need to go.” His voice was high and tight, so unlike his usual radio-announcer smoothness that we all stared at him for a moment.

“What’s happening?” I demanded. Jazz didn’t answer, just grabbed the nearest glowstick and joined Rachel outside. They bolted into the night.

“Rachel! Jazz!” I yelled, but they were already gone. Before I could decide whether to go after them, there was a sudden crash outside. Something heavy slammed into the car, hard enough to set the alarm blaring. Then came another scream, this one horrifyingly close.

I stumbled out of the tent, my heart pounding. Hula followed, and so did Tommy, pulling Candi along with him. The screaming was coming from the other side of the car. I stepped closer, and that’s when I saw them—two figures thrashing wildly in the dirt. One of them was Rachel. It took a minute to process the rest.

She was on top of a girl in a green minidress, her teeth sunk deep into the other girl’s neck. Blood sprayed out in dark arcs as the girl kicked and fought, but Rachel didn’t let go.

“Oh my God,” Tommy choked out behind me.

Rachel finally lifted her head, and her face was soaked in blood. Her eyes locked onto me, and for a second, she didn’t look human at all. Then she grinned, her teeth slick and red, and lunged.

Before she could reach us, a lanky blond guy in a tie-dyed t-shirt leaped in front of me. The wet screeching noise Rachel made as he ripped into her shoulder with his teeth sent shivers all the way down my back to my feet. I backed up quick, grabbing Jazz’s sweaty hand and pulling him with me as I turned to run around to the other side of the car.

Tommy came with us, pushing Candi into the back seat. “You drive,” he said quietly, throwing the keys at me. “We all took that stuff.”

I put my hand up automatically to take the keys, but the thwack of cold metal into my palm was almost as much of a shock as the fact that Tommy was willingly handing over his keys. Even on acid, he’d insisted on driving. Nobody drove Baby but Tommy. 

The screaming and growling from behind us convinced me. I slid into the car and turned the key in one motion, not caring that we were leaving a fortune in camping supplies in the middle of a desert party. The engine roared to life and I slammed the gas pedal to the floor, spraying gravel as we backed out of the makeshift parking lot. The party lights were blinding in the rearview mirror. The air was filled with screams and guttural growls, the kind that don’t come from anything human. In the background, the music played on, the high bright notes of happy hardcore providing a counterpoint to the screaming.

It sounded like Hell.

Candi was curled up in the last seat with Hula, their breath coming in short, shallow gasps, but Jazz and Tommy were both wide-eyed and staring in the rearview mirror. The car was swerving a little, but I didn’t care. The weight of what had just happened pressed down on me harder than anything. What the hell had Rachel turned into? And how the hell was she still moving?

“Dude, we need to get out of here.” Jazz’s voice was shaky. I could hear his teeth chattering. “This… this shit’s crazy.”

“Tell me about it,” I muttered, trying to remember how to shift gears as we neared the freeway entrance. The landscape of desolate desert rolled by in eerie silence. The buzzing in my ears wouldn’t stop, but it was nearly drowned out by the thudding of my heart. 

Tommy kept checking the rearview, his fingers dug in tight to the edge of his seat. When he spoke, his voice was too calm. “Something’s off. I don’t think they’re following us. They’re just… standing there.”

I glanced in the rearview again, and sure enough, there was nothing but a dark expanse of black. The highway was empty, but the feeling that something was off didn’t go away. I felt like I was being watched, stared at by something I couldn’t see but could feel creeping closer with each second. Hula and Candi made quiet slobbering noises in the back of the car; I figured they were making out, and was glad they’d found something to do with their nervous energy. Maybe they could still salvage the night. Mine was ruined.

A buzzing sound broke the silence. My phone. I grabbed it, nearly dropping it from the sudden rush of adrenaline. The car swerved a little as I tried to focus on two things at once. The screen flashed a dozen texts from people I barely knew, all talking about the same thing: people turning on each other, out of nowhere. All the messages mentioned a party gone wrong. I hadn’t even seen some of these people at the party, which meant things had gone wrong in a big way.

Swallowing hard, I steadied the car, then glanced back at the others. Only Tommy was looking at me, his pupils enormous and dark in his pale face. He nodded, slowly, and a bead of sweat dripped down his face. Very slowly and carefully, he said, “I think we should drop you off at home, dude. You’re obviously having a bad trip.”

Jazz turned around, glancing at Tommy. I had the weirdest idea that everyone in the car was looking at him, like they didn’t want to let me leave. After a moment, Jazz nodded, and I turned my attention back to the road, feeling somehow spared. “You should be somewhere comfortable.”

I shuddered. Jazz was still using that weird, high voice, like there was something wrong with his vocal cords, and it was obviously costing Tommy a lot of effort to look and sound halfway normal. But I wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth, especially when the gift horse was offering me a way out of this supremely creepy situation. I figured I could always catch up with them tomorrow.

“Thanks, guys.” I pointed the car towards home and tried to focus on not crossing the yellow lines. The lights were still starry and far too bright, and I could feel chills and heat rushing through my body in waves. All I wanted to do was get home to my safe, soft bed and ride out the rest of the night in peace.

I didn’t know what they had planned for the rest of the night. The hunting, the screaming, the… feasting. I didn’t know that Hula had already eaten most of Candi’s face by the time they dropped me off. I swear. And what they did to that woman...

I told the police that, but they didn’t believe me. I could tell they wanted to arrest me for the pills, but of course I didn’t have anything on me. I was in the station for twelve hours before my lawyer finally showed up. They told me to call them if I saw or heard from my friends again, and that was that. I thought it was over. 

It’s been a busy couple of days at work, what with my manager missing and everything, so I haven’t had a lot of time to think. It’s probably better that way, honestly. Every time I close my eyes, I see that guy at the jungle stage and hear Hula’s voice in my head. 

But a few hours ago I was getting ready for bed, and I happened to look out the window. At first it looked like a perfectly normal November evening on a busy street: people milling about on the sidewalks, stopping to chat with their neighbors, standing around. I almost closed the curtain again. Then I realized that nobody was moving. 

They were all staring up at my window. 

That would have been bad enough, but in the front of the group I recognized the goth chick from the desert party. Standing behind her, half-hidden by a tree, was Rachel. I couldn’t spot the others, but I knew they were there.

I know what they want. It’s what they’ve wanted since that first night, although something in Tommy was still human enough to talk them out of it. I know there’s no way around it; next time I leave my apartment, they’ll be waiting. I also know there’s one way to make sure it doesn’t matter what they do to me. I took that pill home with me, after all.

I swallowed it a couple of minutes ago. 

I’m not sure how long I have before the pill kicks in, but I don’t think I have much longer until my friends make it inside. Hopefully, by the time they get here, all of this will seem like a bad trip.

But if you’re reading this, you might not be so lucky. If someone offers you Vex at a party… leave. Before you see what it can do.

I can feel the chills starting in my feet, and the world is already starting to go dark gray at the edges. The lights are *so* bright. Something in my stomach stirs, some hunger I barely understand, though it’s growing stronger with every throb of my heartbeat. Through my feet I can feel the pounding of the bass as someone in a nearby apartment starts up a techno track.

Or is that my friends, pounding on the door?
