I stumbled upon the website when somebody on a forum I frequented posted a link to it. Supposedly you could submit your details and you would become the prey in a real-life game of cat-and-mouse. The user who posted the link claimed he had barely survived the game, and upon immediate skepticism encouraged other users to see for themselves. Upon clicking the link, I was taken to an outdated website with a sentence at the centre of the page in large bold letters.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*"Want to be hunted? All you have to do is ask :)"*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a basic form at the bottom of the page requesting my name, age and the date I wished for the hunt to begin. I typed in a fake name and my real age before asking for the hunt to begin next week. It was a cool name though, and I always wanted to change mine to it as a kid because it was the name of a character in my favourite TV show. Bobby Wise. After the form was submitted, I navigated away from the page and went about the rest of my evening having forgotten about it. I mean, it seemed to obviously be just some IP-grabbing link for most people and personal detail-scraping for those dumb enough to then input their actual names. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I woke up five days later and was about to head to work when a text came through. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Ding*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*"Your hunt will commence in thirty minutes. You will have an hour from the first sighting of your hunter to escape. At any point following the first sighting, there will be no warning period. The hunt will continue in perpetuity regardless of physical, mental or any other impairing factors.* 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Good luck."*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I first saw him as I sat on the subway heading to work. A tall gentleman, wearing a long black coat and a fedora. He looked like something out of a history book. We locked eyes, and his lips curled into a wry smile whilst he gave me a slight wink. He looked down at his wristwatch, still with that smile on his face. I looked at mine.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Twelve minutes until I was to be hunted. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He left the subway car at the same stop as me, and I felt a warm whisper in my ear as I walked to the exit. *Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.* At that point, I finally realised he was most certainly there for me, that he was my hunter. The logistics of it all didn't come into my mind at that point, because I was more concerned with how to win this supposedly unwinnable game. Looking back on that day, I don't know how he found me. I hadn't given my real name, nor had I been digitally vulnerable at the time I submitted the form. I was using a VPN, so I can't see how my IP might have been grabbed and the only real detail I provided was my age. Perhaps I was naive in thinking the sketchy corners of the internet I often found myself on couldn't live up to the stories we've all heard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I eventually made my way to the office and plopped down into my reliably comfortable chair, presuming that the manned entrance downstairs would keep the man from the subway out. Not long after, I was proven wrong. I walked over to my colleague's desk to ask him about some mundane work-related stuff, only to find the man sitting there instead. I turned to run, but he grabbed my arm with an immensely tight hold and kept me in place. Whilst aware of the fact he probably wouldn't do me much harm in a relatively busy office building, my blood ran cold and I was terrified regardless. Without saying a word and with that same terribly unsettling smile on his face, he handed me an envelope. Plain white, with no markings or addressing on either side. He let go of me after I reluctantly accepted it and I promptly made my way to the bathroom in a panic. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I wish I had never read that note.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*"Turns out there was a 27-year-old named Bobby Wise in this town. He just wasn't you. Poor guy didn't know what he was in for. Here's a photo, so you know what you made me do. So you have to live with it."*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Behind the note, there was a small Polaroid picture with the word *"Captured"* scrawled in the white space below the photo in black marker ink. A young man sat upright, tied to a wooden chair with silver duct tape across his mouth. The ends of his flowing hair dripped fresh blood onto the white shirt he wore. His head had several holes across it, as did his face. You could see the exposed bones and brain matter through the various holes and blood seeped out of them all. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I threw up all over that bathroom stall. I didn't know that site would actually have people hunted, and I didn't know the stupid fake name I gave them would actually turn out to be a real person in our somewhat small city. I can't live with what I caused, and I'm afraid of going to the police because upon reading the local newspaper, a Bobby Wise who looked exactly like the photo I'd been given was reported missing four days before my "Hunt" began. I figure the texts and the countdown when I first encountered the man were a ruse, to make me at least somewhat aware of the game being real and so the man could approach me and give me the envelope that changed my life. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I guess I needed to get this out there, not just in a futile attempt to forgive myself but to warn others.

&#x200B;

If you come across a site that claims you can ask to be hunted, please save yourself from what it can turn into.
