Report 98520-A6  Date: 6/77

[SUBJECT BEGINS]

1  From the start? If you insist.. Once we landed in the crater we waited patiently for the ship to signal our home world. There must have been maybe 20 of us on that ship including the interns,  my team and the safety personnel. I don't need to tell you that, it's all on record. The head management of the Inner Stellar Correction Committee (ISCC) appeared on screen and instructed me and my team outside. The first thing I noticed when we touched down on the planet (which we had already suspected was home to a CLASS TWO intelligent species) was the lights that we had observed from above its surface and a hot burning that whipped through the humid air.

2    I demanded agent 6802 to set up the radio signal and the terran scanner so we could document a clear description of the planet to the ISCC. 6802 made his way inside and activated them both, sending the thin contact pole rising into the air. At this point my entire team was noticeably wheezy. We now understand that this was a result of the high nitrogen concentration the planet’s atmosphere contained. Among other things, you now know. My team and I retreated inside and meticulously observed the scanner. 

[Subject begins convulsing after this point— stand by medical professionals were sent into the quarantine bubble immediately and a short break was made at 22:09 before returning.]

3   589 and 3852 were outside collecting geo-samples while the rest of us huddled around the screen as it scanned the land. Orange and red outlines took place among the foliage that shined blue on the heat sensors. All together the entire ship immediately understood upon inspection that this must have been the “man” upper management sent us to judge. They surrounded the ship in what we could only assume was curiosity. Agent 589 and 3852 slid inside. Based on how they looked, they had also seen Earth’s “men”. I think one of us began to vomit, maybe two of us? Heck, maybe it was me who started to throw up, in my amazement i couldn't tell. If only I could bring in another eyewitness for you guys to question. If only.

4   “My god. Captain, look at the report.” murmured a few as we gathered around the now completed scan. 

5   The monitors revealed horrors beyond what the Committee had yet seen. How mankind had stripped their planet of all it had. Its resources and space, even its fellowship, wasn't safe. We sat there for several minutes before returning outside the shuttle. The Committee would surely be surprised to see all the things the men had done. If we had told them right then they might have gone through with the Correction right there with us still on the planet. The men watched from the hill. 

6   We spent a while taking samples. The sky turned shades of warm colors, I think 3852 thought this was doomsday before we assured her thos colors were standard here when dusk formed on this planet. All the while I was pacing while one of the interns read out the scan report. I'll spare you the details. You don't want to know. I can write it down but I won't speak what I heard aloud, not unless I'm forced. 

7  The men walked into the crater where our ship rested. They also sat atop bigger quadrupeds. I think that's what they were because at the time I thought they were mechanical extensions of their bodies like we have at some of the occupational facilities but once we sent the correction later on I think I saw some men detach from them. The crowd raised a white handkerchief. We knew what that meant, I guess I was surprised they did too but after what my team had seen, this “surrender” seemed more like a trap and we were not willing to side with the men. It's not like taking the humans hostage could have saved my team.

8   The men frantically waved the flag as they closed in. With the green lights illuminating from our ship we had a better look at the humans. No description of these creatures could truly do them justice. I have a hard time recalling what they looked like now. Small, definitely. Four disfigured tendrils. No, no tendrils wouldn’t be the right word. They were more like rope, frayed at the ends. And they miraculously suspended themselves upon two wobbly limbs that still managed to keep their shape. Freaks.

[Subject begins coughing violently; nurses are sent into his quarantine room for a physical evaluation— Subject resumes]

9   Their approach sent my team and I into a frenzy. I guess we were a bit scared. I mean it's a bit absurd isn’t it? I've been working with this committee for years, I've gone to plenty of planets and yet I don't think we've ever encountered a species that actually approached our ship. Our headsets erupted in a piercing static and the head of ISCC roared his commands to us via the headsets. Me and my crew wasted no time entering the ship. We all sat down as Mr Xeinoph appeared as a green hologram. His face was off colored and distraught. The way he looked would’ve been priceless had we not all been just as concerned as him. Clearly, he had read the report but he did not mention what he heard. 

10 “The console has come to the conclusion that this planet can be deemed destructive, we have approved the Correction request and you are free to launch it when you finish the geo-terrain scan.” I remember that bit. I don’t really know why but I can play that statement clear in my mind. His voice shook and cracked. If I hadn’t known any better I would've supposed he was going to start sobbing.

We took the initiative and launched The Correction. “The flame” as it's been named in the industry. We watched the monitor as the Earth’s ground flashed and the green smoke pooled around our shuttle and shot up into the air. 

The thrusters hissed as we prepared to launch. Like I had mentioned before, I've done missions for the ISCC many times but I don't think I've ever really taken time to admire the first level of the correction’s launch. A green smoke rises from the top containment area of our ship. The smoke is just a form of mildly poisonous gas. It pretty much just keeps the species from freaking out and harming us while the ship loads the second phase. I'm actually not sure if I'm allowed to tell you guys that. Eh, it doesn’t matter to me anymore. It's not like I'm going to work with the ISCC ever again. It's not like I even can ever work again.

I was the designated person to do the second phase. Of Course i was. I'm the only person on the ship the flame wouldn’t affect. That's how they choose the captains if you were ever curious. It's a ceremony you go through to captain the correction ships. Okay, okay, sorry, I'm back on topic. The entire ship rubbled as it powered up and I deployed The flame. I took the green flare of light in my tentacles and made my hasty descent to the doors.

I guess this is where it started. I'm not sure if it was the inhalation of the air for two long or maybe a sort of defense mechanism the humans had designed to keep newcomers out. Well I guess it worked either way. I stepped outside the ship and held the flame high. You probably already know that the flame is a mutated version of a common bacteria, it was on the news years back when it was made but I don't know if you've ever seen that.

I stood proud in front of the humans with the flame raised high. This is when my eye started to water and my skin became dry. I twitched in pain but I stood still and let the flame take its time. The Corrections Flame flew from my outstretched tendrils and down on to one of the men carrying their white flag. The flame did its job flawlessly. The man dropped like a sack of rocks, its strange wire-like appendages flopping to the ground like wet rags. Every passer-by followed suit. That's when I really noticed the burning. I coughed up my stomach and then retracted it back. I scuttled inside as quickly as I could while my exoskeleton writhed and scorched. I entered the cockpit and everyone remained silent for just a few seconds before coming to my aid. 

I spent the next few minutes outstretched on the ground catching my breath. The ship blasted us into the air. I caught a glimpse of the outside cameras. The flame ragged as the men fled. Look at me, I know you won't believe me but I saw a man stand among the flames unharmed. I think I was experiencing how he should have felt. I felt skin bubble and pop but it was only slightly off colored at most.

That's pretty much it. On the way back here my crew caught whatever illness those freaks gave me and they never made it back.. 

I started to question the morality of what we're doing here. I mean desiccating entire species because we don't think they are “good”. You would never believe how hard it is to find intelligent species in this galaxy. The humans did horrible things but galactic genocide may be worse.
