My dad gave me an ultimatum after my freshman year in college. Living on campus with a meal plan had become more expensive. Since he was fronting half of the bill, my father wanted more of a say in where I could stay and who with. I had to live with other students of my university, and I couldn’t live coed. I rolled my eyes at the latter, but I couldn’t argue with him when he threatened not to help pay at all. Even with a work study, I would barely get enough to scrape by as is. With the summer fast approaching, I scrambled to find both a part-time job and a place to rent. The job came easier than renting. I was majoring in English, but I had a great fascination with historical documents and transcribing old writings. I was lucky to get recommended for a museum internship by one of my professors. Through this internship, I met my roommate Chris, and now I cannot get out of that house fast enough.

My college town may be smaller than most, but it’s not without its local heroes. One such man was named Ol’ Saul. Ol’ Saul was a part of the original generation of settlers in the area. He worked odd jobs as a carpenter and handyman in the town. The man never married, but he had a soft spot for kids in need. He built a schoolhouse all on his own and took in orphaned or abandoned children he came across. In exchange for lodging and education, the kids would help the man around his farm. Ol’ Saul’s house and the schoolhouse were broken down and rebuilt to display at the agricultural museum I now work at. The original stone basement was still standing in town. After Saul passed, the land was divided up amongst the town. The schoolhouse became a permanent fixture of the town until progress moved time forward to the larger, more modern buildings used today.

I was curious about the original foundation, so I went hunting for it one afternoon. It was a dark grey stone, green with moss, that looked weathered and smooth with time. There was an ancient softness about the stones, but they’d obviously been built upon in recent times. Atop the foundation was a newer home. My eyes were immediately drawn to the bright orange neon sign on the front lawn. RENTING BASEMENT STUDIO - CALL (XXX) XXX-XXXX. I couldn’t believe my luck. Charlie’s dad owned the property, so he was the ‘landlord’ technically. They had renovated the basement into a one-bedroom apartment. It was perfect. Charlie and I actually hit it off. He was a theater major, focusing on lighting and other electronics involved in shows. It felt easier talking to him about my interests and major without having to defend myself against another engineer or pre-med student who thought they were better than me because of a career choice.

The first few months were great. I never noticed much besides some strange noises late at night. There are some nights it sounds like something is barreling through the vents. Other times, I hear scuttling up the walls as if something is slithering inside. I tried to bring it up with Charlie, but he always furrowed his brow and stared at me in confusion as he said things like,

“I didn’t hear anything last night.”

“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming?”

I tried searching around the property for a hole or any indication of an animal that somehow got into the walls, but I could find nothing. I started to think I was crazy until I got it on camera. A small white blur shooting past the bathroom floor vent. Charlie hummed noncommittally as he watched the video.

“You can send it to my dad, I guess. But I’m telling you that he’s not going to find anything. It’s really a waste of time. A waste of money, he’d say if he could.”

Anger flared hot in my chest. My jaw locked for a second as I scrambled for words against the rising lump of indignation in my throat. I sent the video to his dad anyway. I expected him to send out an inspector, but Charlie’s dad showed up instead and started rummaging through the basement. I wanted to protest as he opened drawers, moved furniture, and inspected the vents, but I didn't know if I could since he’s the property owner. Charlie’s dad never ended up doing anything about the problem either. He just put his hands on his hips and said,

“Well boys, I don’t know what to tell you. I can’t find any holes or droppings anywhere. It’s probably just the vents settling.”

He was addressing the both of us, but was making intense eye contact with only me. I shifted from foot to foot, not understanding his dismissal of the subject. I ignored the ‘I-told-you-so’ look on Charlie’s face and kept pushing.

“What about the scratching?"

Charlie’s dad shrugged. “Probably just raccoons or possums or something else outside, but there are no animals inside the property.” 

I didn’t know what to say in response. I was floored by how videos of clearly some kind of animal inside the walls wouldn’t lead to some kind of inspection. I guess our power never went out and there weren’t any problems with the other electronics, just the scratching and jittering of tiny feet keeping me up all night. I tried playing sleep aids and other music to block it out, but the sounds always hammered through in the back of my mind. Sometimes I could even feel the vibrations of the scratching from the unknown creature through the walls. I tried to throw myself into school work and my internship, but losing so much sleep was starting to take a real toll. 

Everything escalated a few weeks after I got Nemo. Nemo was a small black chihuahua mix dog I found wandering our neighborhood. He was prematurely grey around his eyes and snout from living on and off the street the vet said. He didn’t have a microchip, so I decided to keep him. I called him Nemo because his right leg is disfigured, twisted into a small nub, reminding me of Nemo’s ‘good’ fin. Charlie didn’t have any complaints about him. He sometimes would walk Nemo when I was busy with work or class. But then, I started to notice my dog’s odd behavior around the house. 

He would sit for hours staring into dark corners. His ears bent back. His small body shaking violently as he bared his teeth into a grimace. His eyes were blown wide with terror yet Nemo was trying to put on a brave face to ward off whatever he sensed. A friend had once told me that dogs could hear termites moving through the walls. That sometimes, this is what they were barking at when growling in a dark corner. I brought it up to Charlie, reinvigorating my ideas that an animal or something was in the walls. He wouldn’t call his dad or an exterminator. He said that there was no damage or evidence of termites or anything else. I feel insane.  I tried pushing down all my doubts. The more I try to ignore it, the more I think of it. 

Then, something bit Nemo. He was snuffling along the back of the couch, trying to find a toy that got lodged back there. His high pitch yelp and cries jolted me out of a half-sleep trance. I tore the couch from the wall to see Nemo whimpering and holding up his left paw. His brown eyes squinted in pain. Blood spilled from his paw and over his toes onto the wooden floor by one of the air vents. I took my phone to shine a light down the vent, but I couldn’t see anything. I heard various scratches behind the wall as well, like tiny bodies buzzing around just behind the drywall. My panic ignited into more anger. Whatever this thing was, it had hurt my dog, and I wasn’t going to let it get away with it.

I found a hammer and brought it down on the wall just above the floor vent. Fuck Charlie and fuck his dad. They could patch over the hole for all I cared. I knew there was something back there. After the initial shock of the first hit, I kept hammering with wild abandon until a small hole began to form. Without the drywall as a barrier, the skittering sounded more like teeth chattering. Ominous whispers floated through the empty air from the hole. I hovered uneasily, crouching down slowly, all of my previous vigor drained. Using my phone’s light, I glanced inside the hole.

There were a lot of wood shavings on the floor inside. I could see many teeth marks indented in the wood paneling as small white bodies danced alongside the insulation. Only, it wasn’t termites, but teeth. Small teeth, like a child’s. Some canines, some molars, and more bounced along the drywall and wood paneling. I could even see groups of teeth writhing and bubbling together, like a haunted, floating grin without flesh.

Look’s like some kids never left Ol’ Saul’s schoolhouse.

I pushed the couch back against the wall and gathered Nemo into my arms. I packed a bag and took him to the vet. He’s fine now. His paw was patched up and now he’s sleeping in my lap as I lay in the back seat of my car. I didn’t tell Charlie I was leaving, but he never asked. If anyone is looking for a room to rent, I know one where you can find it cheap, if you can stand the company.
