The exorcism couldn’t have gone better.

Let me say thank you to everyone who gave suggestions and was supportive of me in this absolutely fucked up situation. I know some of you felt like you were losing me for a second, but I guarantee, I’m here to stay.

Oh! Here are parts [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mrgydz/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife), [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mt20xs/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife_part_2), and [three](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mvo3w5/im_no_longer_possessed_by_my_dead_wife_part_3) so you can see how this journey is going and how it is now (sadly?) ending. Again, thanks everybody. My time with you has been short. I did all I could to stop this.

Formalities aside, you’re probably *dying* to know how the exorcism went.

First off, if it wasn’t clear… I didn’t go to priest school and get my Ph.D. in exorcism-ology. You will have to forgive me if I get any details wrong or explain anything poorly. Secondly, I’m doing this more for your sake, rather than my own. I’ve never felt so free.

I’m going to put a warning here. From here on out, things get pretty messed up.

They arrived early in the morning. Yes, ‘they’. I was expecting one person—probably that old man—with a leatherbound tome with a golden cross glittering brightly on the cover. He’d then flip to a specific passage, say some words. *Poof!* Demons GONE.

If being wrong were an Olympic sport, I would’ve taken home the gold medal. Although there was a book, it looked nothing like that though. There were probably over a dozen priests. I was surprised when three people greeted me at the door. 

I was like, “Hello, gentleman, so how are we going to—”

I couldn’t even finish my sentence before they pushed me out of the way. One after another, they poured in with different chests that were stained and rusted, like they’d been around longer than I have. They’d open them and god knows what spilled out. All I can recall clearly is that one of them was filled with bottles and the muffled noise of glass clanging against one another whenever they struggled to bring it through the front door.

One of them had the *audacity* to say, “Didn’t know you lived in a pigsty.”

My guy. I’ve literally been possessed for God knows how long. I woke up… IN MY BASEMENT with a NOOSE around my neck. Not exactly a typical Wednesday morning. A little leeway would be appreciated.

Anyway.

One of the younger priests explained to me how what you see in movies is often depicted incorrectly compared to what is needed in reality for this type of exorcism. I thought this type of stuff didn’t happen to begin with. Color me confused. 

I spoke with the old priest on the phone yesterday about this event. He said that he’d need a couple of extra helping hands in order to “Banish this thing for good.”

Understatement of the century. They first took bottle after bottle and poured this red liquid all over the house. Upstairs, downstairs, basement, and then they poured the rest in the front yard. They then surrounded the house with a circle of salt, so “They couldn’t leave.” I mean, bucket after bucket they poured around the perimeter. 

I was told not to leave the premises during this whole event. What else could I possibly be doing during a situation like this?

I asked the old priest, “Was all of this really necessary?”

His face was unmoving. “If there was only one spirit, maybe not. But there are hundreds.”

I then, for the second time in a short while, shit bricks all over the floor. I could’ve built a house with all the bricks that I expelled.

He definitely made it sound ‘not good’ whenever he visited last Saturday, but this was something else. 

I told the old priest the whole situation on his visit that Saturday. I told him what I already told you. How I would black out and wake up in different locations and the circumstances behind them. Well he had come up with a solution to my dilemma. 

They hammered a wooden effigy that depicted someone being like… crucified or something. They put one in each location where I would wake up. They drilled a fucking hole into my tub to fit the effigy (add that to the list of things to fix). It took the priests the longest to find the spot in the forest (where I wake up on Monday) since I couldn’t leave the house and point it out to them. It didn’t actually take them that long because they told me a ring of mushrooms surrounded the spot I described.

Then they opened the back of this big van and took out different animals. They brought them in, one by one, then ritualistically started sacrificing them on my living room carpet. A carpet, mind you, my wife had gotten me. They did one for each day I was passing out, for a total of five. All the different animals were young because “They experience terror in its purest form.”

They held them down and… I don’t have to describe what they did to them. As they prepared the animals, they set fire to the wooden effigies. A bright turquoise flame would immediately envelope the effigy. After some time the flame would turn to shadow then go out.

I didn’t watch most of them burn. I only watched the one in the shower. They hung the rosaries around this one. I remember clutching them so tight my hand would nearly bleed. Watching it burn was almost cathartic. 

The most awful screams followed their burnings. It continued until the effigies were ash. It sounded like hundreds of people being thrown into an open pit filled with fire.

They assured me, “This was normal.” Yeah, okay, ‘normal’. To whom may I ask?

They said each animal was for a different location and had to symbolize something… yada yada. More religious nonsense, but for those who are interested, each effigy was lit for a different animal. A calf for the basement. A kit for the shed. A fawn for the forest. A chick for the driveway. And a fish for the shower. They told me it HAD to be these animals and it HAD to be in this order.

I explained to them they didn’t have to like… gut the fish on my floor, since it couldn’t… ya know… breathe. Yet, they insisted. 

The old priest emphasized, “We have our job and you have yours.”

Yeah, stand around and watch all this fucked up shit? Consider my two weeks put in.

I was afraid to even ask why they would do this. What part of this was necessary? I asked myself. Well, the old priest explained it pretty simply.

Where this house is located is where a lot of Indigenous natives were gathered and most likely slaughtered or executed. An educated assumption on his part. He didn’t know how many spirits there were; all he knew was that their spirits were furious. He said he wouldn’t be surprised if over a hundred people died here. He described the spirits like a meatball. 

*Okay*… he didn't describe it like that. He had to rephrase what he said multiple times in order for me to understand. That’s what he *eventually* landed on. 

So yeah, like a meatball. All the spirits were packed together. Those spirits were manipulating my body, leaving me in strange places. Eventually, since my actions became so specific, he believed there was a pilot. A singular soul that was guiding my actions.

“When the flower wilted, they lingered with all the other spirits here,” he said.

When the miscarriage happened, everyone in the house was vulnerable. He assumed something had crawled its way inside of me during this time, but again, he wasn’t sure.

That’s why they needed those creatures. When they feel that terror, the spirits instinctively leave my body and transfer to the more vulnerable vessel. When they are taken care of, the spirits are then banished with nowhere to go.

I asked, “Where do the spirits end up?”

The head priest only shrugged. “The Matriarch will guide them to where they need to be.”

By this point I had mentally checked out from all the stuff going on. He then tried to give this long and boring explanation of how the ancient rite he was performing worked. I would be lying if I said I was paying attention. There was A LOT of religious mumbo jumbo my mind simply couldn’t grasp.

For those of you wondering, no, they didn’t help me clean up. They left everything. I was told to remain here in this salt circle until all the spirits are gone. It should take a couple of days at most. Grocery shopping will have to wait, I guess.

They finished the exorcism by carving some symbols into the walls, followed by a few additional prayers and *poof* (for real this time), no more ‘spirits’. Apparently, they are not demons, and I was scolded heavily for calling them that.

I couldn’t care less. All I know is that I’m feeling much better. I don’t feel… influenced? Is that the right word? My actions are feeling more of their own. I’m just excited to get back to work and plant a few more roses.

I also blacked out today. According to my watch, it was barely even an hour. When I came to, I was vigorously trying to get the stains from the ritual out of my living room carpet. Great. Who's going to clean all this stuff up now? The one time I actually *wanted* to be possessed for a little while longer.

Just kidding, obviously. I think if I’m never possessed again, it would be too soon.

I asked them about Monday and Tuesday, how I blacked out for over forty-eight hours. 

The old man explained, “Whatever it was, it was desperate and weak. If it had real power, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. Their folly allowed us to purify the house.” I imagine if his lungs could’ve handled a cigarette, he would’ve taken a puff, but instead, he nodded. “I’ll send my regards.”

Which is a somewhat satisfying explanation, at least for me. He would describe these spirits as animals. They have their patterns and instincts, which can easily be manipulated with the right knowledge. They aren’t all-powerful. They aren’t invincible. They have rules they have to follow, just as we are guided by the invisible rules of our subconscious.

I told him I didn’t want to think about anything like that.

He nodded.

I then asked, “Why didn't it kill me?”

He gave me a surprised look, well… as surprised as his old face would allow. He just shook his head at me.

I think a part of me will always wonder why it couldn’t. 

You should have seen the looks on these priests' faces though. Some of them still muttered that they felt an ‘evil’ presence. But… it’s probably nothing. 

I’ve watered the roses today. I forgot the other days, sorry if anyone reminded me. They’re generally fine for three days without water, so not the biggest deal. I had some slightly more pressing issues, if that wasn’t clear.

I really liked being transparent with you all. I tried my best to explain this horrifying situation to the best of my ability, but I’ve never been that strong of a writer, and I am running out of time, it seems.

So, I guess that is all there is to say. I’ll give another update, if necessary, but I don’t want to bore you all with “Haha, I’m so great now.” Unless you guys want that sort of thing.

Ultimately, I think I hit the nail on the head with saying, “I’m no longer possessed by my dead wife.” She is too kind-hearted, loving, and nourishing to do the things that I was put through. I’m glad whatever was here is now gone.

And now I think I will end this series of posts much like how it began. 

With another story of my beautiful wife.

I met her on a video call. There were probably, I don’t know, thirty people. Our moderator would then introduce us one by one, which took fucking *forever.* Let me tell you, a bunch of grief-stricken individuals are usually not tech-savvy or prone to not wallowing in their grief for an unnecessary amount of time, in my experience.

On this video call, when this one woman was speaking, I was captivated. I mean, I hung on her every word. I was lucky enough to get her contact information. We’d soon stop appearing in the meetings, and our calls were more… private. We’d talk about our experience with loss, but also about other things. For example, she was an elementary school teacher. She absolutely *loved* kids. She was stunning too, even through the pixilated camera and her terrible internet connection. That 480p quality had me smitten, let me tell you.

So much so that we decided to take our interactions offline; it started with texting. We were mostly just trauma dumping on one another. She told me about how her husband died. I told her about how I lost my daughter.

She then told me about how she has two sons, and that they’ve been handling the loss of their father a lot better than she has.

I told her we all deal with loss differently. You have to go at your own pace. You can’t be hung up forever, though; there is a time when you can stretch yourself too thin—carving out pieces of yourself for no reason.

Long distance was never my style, but for her? I tolerated it. I much prefer intimate interactions. We’d watch *Real Housewives of Atlanta* while talking over the phone. She loved that show because that’s where she was from. She’d tell me, “If it isn’t trash TV, it ain’t for me.” As if this were some sort of profound idiom to be carried on for generations.

When I met her… man. When you’ve been talking with someone for three months, only seeing them on video, seeing them in person is like a whole other experience. Her pale skin was utterly flawless. Her Raven hair just gave her such a mysterious vibe that made me want to know more about her.

My dear readers, you should really appreciate the ones you have. At any moment, at any time, they can be taken from you. Sometimes it’s unexpected, sometimes it’s not. Sometimes you have to come to grips with the reality of an inescapable situation.

I hope none of you find yourselves in that position. I really loved my wife. She was so excited for her first day in Anchorage. Yet, she kept trying to leave her room—kept playing that damned radio. Day in and day out. I’d ask her to turn it down, but she kept telling me. “I don’t want to go back into the basement.” 

Yeah. No one *wants* to go into the basement. It’s dark as shit. They're creepy crawlies. Fierce competition.

I told her, “You already won. Why are you making things so difficult?”

She wouldn’t respond. She would get this far-off look in her eye as she stared out the guest room window. She wouldn’t even clean the house anymore when I asked.

I have a question. Is it reasonable to throw yourself out of a window if someone asks you to go to the basement? Because she found that to be a perfectly justifiable solution to our predicament. Crawled all the way to the driveway, muttering words under her breath the entire time. A terrible situation for everyone involved.

The past is the past, I suppose, and none of that matters now. Every relationship deals with hardship, but it’s how you navigate that hardship together that determines whether a relationship blooms or wilts.

Remember, you can always work out those issues. In the end, what matters is the time you spend together. And I cherished every single second of it. It’s a shame that she didn’t qualify; she would have borne a beautiful daughter.
