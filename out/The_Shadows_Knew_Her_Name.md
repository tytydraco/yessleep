PART 5 - THE CONFRONTATION

The farmhouse loomed in the distance, its silhouette barely visible through the sheets of rain. TJ stood in the middle of the field, clutching the medallion tightly to his chest as if it were a security blanket. The cold, mocking echo of Lily’s laughter lingered in his ears, making his breath hitch every time he thought he heard it again.

“This is fine,” TJ muttered to himself, trying to drown out the growing unease. “This is just... marriage, right? A little bit of laughing shadows, a little bit of demonic possession. Pretty standard stuff.” He gave a shaky laugh and then looked at the medallion in his hand. The strange symbols etched into its surface seemed to shimmer faintly in the dim light. “We’re gonna have a long talk about boundaries, Lily.”

The rain stung his face as he pulled out his phone and called Mike. It rang three times before his friend picked up. “What’s up, man?” Mike’s voice was casual, but the static on the line suggested TJ’s connection to the living world was getting a little tenuous.

“Oh, you know, not much,” TJ said, voice dripping with sarcasm. “Just out here in the rain, contemplating life, holding a medallion that may or may not be the only thing keeping me alive. Also, my wife’s a demon. How’s your Tuesday?”

There was a pause. “What?” Mike finally asked.

“Mike, I need your help,” TJ said, cutting through his own attempts at humor. “The house is… not great. Lily is… very not great. Just get here. Bring… I don’t know, holy water? A baseball bat? Something?”

Another pause. “Are you messing with me?”

“Mike,” TJ said, his voice taking on an edge of desperation. “I am standing in a field, in the rain, while my house makes growling noises at me. Does that sound like a prank to you?”

“Fair point,” Mike muttered. “I’ll be there.”

By the time Mike’s car pulled up the muddy driveway, the rain had slowed to a drizzle. TJ stood on the porch, soaked to the bone, the medallion swinging from his neck like an overachieving good luck charm. He couldn’t ignore the faint warmth emanating from it, as though the object itself was reacting to the house.

Mike stepped out of his car, holding what looked like a crowbar in one hand and a thermos in the other. “Okay, I’m here,” he said. “Why do you look like you lost a fight with a lawn sprinkler?”

“It’s called ambiance, Mike,” TJ shot back. “And you brought a crowbar? What, were you expecting a zombie apocalypse?”

Mike held up the thermos. “Holy water. Figured you’d need both.”

TJ blinked. “You just have holy water on hand?”

“You’re married to a demon, TJ. I’ve seen weirder.”

“Touché,” TJ muttered, leading the way inside. “Welcome to Hell—I mean, my home.”

The farmhouse had a presence. The kind of presence that made you want to check over your shoulder every few seconds to make sure the walls weren’t closing in. Shadows seemed to flicker just out of sight, and the air was thick with an energy that made Mike grip his crowbar a little tighter.

“So,” Mike said, looking around. “Where’s Lily?”

“She’s… around,” TJ said, waving vaguely at the staircase. “You know, doing demon stuff. Floating ominously. Probably staring into a mirror and muttering Latin. Classic Wednesday activities.”

“And you’ve been living here? Alone?” Mike asked, incredulously.

“No,” TJ said quickly. “The house is here, too. And the shadows. And the whispers. So really, not alone.”

Mike raised an eyebrow. “You’re coping really well with this.”

“If by coping you mean rapidly losing my grip on reality, then yes,” TJ quipped. “Let’s just get to the part where we… I don’t know, exorcise my house? My wife? Me?”

“Your sense of humor’s gonna get us killed,” Mike muttered.

“Wouldn’t be the first time,” TJ replied cheerfully.

As they made their way through the house, the air seemed to grow heavier. The lights flickered, then went out entirely. Mike turned on the flashlight on his phone, and TJ did the same.

“Dark house. Phone lights. Yup, this is how every horror movie starts,” TJ muttered, holding his phone out in front of him. The beam illuminated the narrow hallway, the shadows seeming to stretch and writhe.

“Quiet,” Mike whispered. “We don’t want to—”

A sudden skittering sound echoed through the walls, like dozens of tiny claws scrambling against wood. Both men froze.

“What the fuck was that?” TJ hissed, his voice just loud enough to be heard. “You heard that, right? Tell me you heard that.”

“Yeah, I heard it,” Mike whispered back, his grip tightening on the crowbar. “What… what lives in your walls?”

“Apparently whatever this medallion didn’t kill,” TJ said. “Great. Add that to the list of house problems. Demons, shadows, and… mutant squirrels?”

The skittering sound grew louder, and then the whispers started. Low, guttural, and indecipherable, they seemed to come from everywhere at once. TJ and Mike pressed their backs against the wall, their phone lights darting around the hallway.

“I’m just saying,” TJ whispered, his voice trembling despite the humor. “If I die here, you’re explaining it to my parents.”

“Can you focus?” Mike snapped. “Whatever’s making that noise is—”

A loud crash interrupted him as a door down the hall burst open. The force of it sent a gust of air rushing toward them, carrying the distinct scent of rot and something metallic. TJ’s phone light flickered, and for a moment, the beam caught a figure standing in the doorway. It was Lily, but not the Lily he remembered. Her hair floated around her as if underwater, her eyes glowing faintly in the dark.

“TJ,” she said, her voice layered with something inhuman. “You brought company.”

TJ stepped forward, holding the medallion out in front of him like a shield. “Lily, let’s talk about this. You’ve been… a little intense lately. And I get it, relationships are hard. But maybe… maybe we can set some ground rules? Like no shadow monsters? No growling walls?”

Her lips curled into a smile, sharp and cold. “You still think this is about you?” she said, her voice dripping with disdain. “This is so much bigger than you, TJ.”

Mike unscrewed the thermos and flung a handful of holy water at her. The droplets hissed and steamed as they struck her, and she let out an unearthly shriek. The shadows around her recoiled, and for a moment, the house seemed to pause.

“Nice shot,” TJ said, coughing. “What are you, a priest now?”

“I Googled it,” Mike said, shrugging. “Figured it couldn’t hurt.”

“Well, keep Googling,” TJ said, stepping forward. “Because she looks pissed.”

Lily moved like a predator, her form flickering between human and something far more monstrous. The house seemed to come alive around her, the walls groaning and the floorboards trembling. Shadows lunged at TJ and Mike from every direction, forcing them to move quickly.

“Honestly, Lily,” TJ panted, ducking a flying chair. “I feel like this whole ‘possessed house’ aesthetic is a bit overdone. Ever heard of minimalism?”

Mike hurled another splash of holy water, forcing Lily back. “Can you stop joking for five seconds?” he yelled.

“This is how I cope!” TJ shot back.

As the chaos escalated, the shadows began to coalesce into grotesque forms. One lunged at TJ, its claw-like appendages scraping across the floor as it moved. He swung the medallion wildly, the light flaring and driving the creature back. “Not today, shadow jerk!” he yelled, his voice cracking slightly.

“They’re everywhere!” Mike shouted, swinging the crowbar with surprising precision. He managed to shatter another shadow-form, but more took its place. “What’s the plan here?”

“Plan?” TJ asked, dodging another attack. “I’m winging it! You think I’ve done this before?”

“You’re married to a demon!” Mike shot back. “You’d think you’d have a contingency plan!”

“Oh, sure, let me just whip out my ‘How to Handle Your Possessed Wife’ handbook!” TJ snapped. “Step one: run screaming. Step two: pancakes.”

Mike groaned. “You’re impossible.”

The house itself began to twist, the walls warping and the ceiling lowering as if the structure was alive. Lily’s laughter echoed through the space, growing louder and more distorted.

“You cannot win,” she said, her voice coming from everywhere at once. “You belong to me, TJ. You always have.”

TJ froze, her words cutting deeper than he expected. For a moment, doubt flickered in his mind. Was she right? Had he always been destined for this? He shook his head, gripping the medallion tightly.

“Not today,” he said, his voice steady. “Not ever.”

With renewed determination, he charged toward the center of the room where Lily’s form flickered. The medallion’s light pulsed, growing brighter with each step.

“Mike!” TJ shouted. “Holy water! Now!”

Mike didn’t hesitate. He hurled the remaining contents of the thermos at Lily. The droplets turned to steam as they hit her, and her scream reverberated through the house. The shadows recoiled, and the walls seemed to groan in pain.

“It’s working!” Mike yelled.

“Great!” TJ shouted back. “Now let’s end this!”

The medallion’s energy surged, enveloping TJ in a halo of light. He stepped closer to Lily, her form wavering and flickering like a dying flame. The house trembled violently, as if trying to shake him off.

“Lily,” TJ said, his voice softer now. “I know you’re in there. The real you. And I’m sorry. I’m sorry for whatever brought us to this point. But you can’t stay. This has to end.”

For a moment, her glowing eyes softened. Her form shifted, and for a brief instant, she looked like the woman he had married. “TJ?” she whispered, her voice trembling.

“I’m here,” he said, stepping closer. “Let go, Lily. Let it all go.”

Her expression twisted, a battle waging within her. The shadows surged around her, but the medallion’s light pushed them back. Finally, with a piercing scream, Lily dissolved into a burst of light, the shadows disintegrating with her.

The house fell silent.

TJ collapsed to his knees, the medallion cooling in his hand. Mike rushed to his side, his face pale but relieved.

“We did it,” Mike said, his voice shaking. “We actually did it.”

TJ let out a weak laugh. “Mike, I think I’m gonna need a new therapist.”

“Or a new house,” Mike replied.

“Definitely a new house,” TJ muttered. “Preferably one without a soul.”

TJ looked around the charred remains of the house. It was clear that the evil tied to the structure couldn't simply be banished. “Mike,” he said, standing. “Get the gasoline.”

Mike frowned. “Are we… seriously doing this?”

“Oh, we’re doing this,” TJ replied. “This house has had it coming for years.”

Within minutes, the gasoline was spread across the floors and up the walls. The house seemed to groan in protest, its shadows quivering as if alive.

TJ struck a match. “To new beginnings,” he said, tossing it onto the soaked wood.

The flames roared to life, climbing the walls and engulfing the house in moments. The oppressive energy that had lingered in the air seemed to dissipate as the structure burned, replaced by a strange sense of relief.

The two men stood outside, watching the inferno.

“So,” Mike said, “are you feeling better now?”

TJ exhaled deeply, his shoulders relaxing for the first time in weeks. “Yeah,” he said. “I think I am.”

As dawn broke over the horizon, the farmhouse collapsed in on itself, leaving nothing but ash and embers. For the first time in weeks, TJ felt a sense of peace.

“So,” Mike said, “what now?”

TJ looked at the medallion in his hand, its glow faint but steady. “Now?” he said, a tired smile tugging at his lips. “We get pancakes.”

TJ stared at the burning house; the medallion warm in his hand. For the first time, silence surrounded them, as though the farmhouse’s oppressive grip on the world had finally loosened. Yet, TJ couldn’t ignore the faint sensation lingering in the air, a presence that hadn’t fully left.

For now, the house was silent, its secrets consumed by the fire. But as the flames flickered and died, TJ couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t truly over. As the glow of the flames diminished, Mike placed a hand on TJ’s shoulder. "Let’s get out of here," he said, his voice breaking the silence. TJ nodded, rising slowly, the weight of the medallion heavy in his palm. Whatever darkness had taken Lily, it wasn’t finished. And TJ knew, deep down, it was coming for him.

 

PART 6 - THE AFTERMATH

The farmhouse was gone. The once-imposing structure had collapsed into a heap of glowing embers and ash, the fire reducing its walls to nothing more than charred ruins. TJ stood at the edge of the field, his breath ragged and his chest heavy. The medallion felt cold in his hand now, a stark contrast to the blazing inferno behind him. It was heavy, not just in weight but in meaning, as if it carried the essence of what had transpired. Mike stood beside him, silent, his face pale and streaked with soot.

“It’s over,” Mike said finally, his voice cracking. “She’s gone. The house is gone.”

TJ didn’t respond immediately. He stared at the smoldering ruins, his mind racing with thoughts he couldn’t fully grasp. Was it really over? Or had they simply unleashed something far worse? The screams, inhuman, guttural, and agonized—still rang in his ears, mingling with the crackle of the dying flames. His grip on the medallion tightened as he glanced at its etched symbol glinting faintly in the moonlight, almost mocking him.

“You ever wonder,” TJ finally said, his voice barely above a whisper, “if some things are better left alone? Like, what if we hadn’t burned it down? What if… I don’t know… we made it angry?”

Mike shot him a sidelong glance, his brow furrowing. “I’d say the house had it coming. And whatever’s left, we’ll deal with it.”

TJ nodded absently, though his mind was elsewhere. He couldn’t shake the sensation that the house’s oppressive gaze had followed them, even as its walls collapsed. It wasn’t finished with him. He could feel it.

The drive back to town was heavy with unspoken tension. The rain had stopped, leaving the air thick and humid. Mike gripped the steering wheel tightly, his knuckles white, his eyes fixed on the road.

“You’re not going back there, right?” Mike asked, breaking the silence.

TJ hesitated, his eyes fixed on the medallion resting in his lap. Its faint warmth pulsed against his palm. “I don’t know.”

“You can’t,” Mike said firmly. “That place... it’s evil, TJ. Whatever was in that house, it wanted you. It’s better left buried.”

TJ nodded absently, though his thoughts were a storm of conflicting emotions. He didn’t have the heart to tell Mike that the farmhouse wasn’t done with him. It wasn’t the house anymore—it was the medallion. The weight of it felt unbearable, like a tether to something he couldn’t escape.

That night, TJ checked into a small motel on the outskirts of town. The room was basic but clean, a welcome change from the oppressive atmosphere of the farmhouse. He placed the medallion on the nightstand and collapsed onto the bed, exhaustion overtaking him. But sleep didn’t come easily.

His dreams were vivid and chaotic. He saw Lily, her face shifting between the woman he had married and the monster she had become. He saw the house, standing whole and untouched, its windows glowing with an unnatural light. Whispers filled his mind, growing louder and more insistent until they became a single voice: “You can’t escape me.”

The dreams shifted to memories. He relived the moment he first saw Lily in her wedding dress, the way her smile lit up the room. Then the memory twisted, her face darkening, her eyes glowing with malice. The laughter—that haunting, mocking laughter—filled his mind, drowning out everything else.

TJ jolted awake, drenched in sweat. The room was dark, the only sound the faint hum of the motel’s air conditioner. He glanced at the medallion, its surface glinting faintly in the moonlight. For a moment, he thought he saw the symbol move, the lines shifting like living things. He shook his head, trying to dismiss the thought. It was just his imagination. Wasn’t it?

The next morning, TJ sat in the motel’s diner, nursing a cup of coffee. The warmth of the drink did little to chase away the chill that had settled in his bones. He stared into the cup, the dark liquid swirling like the thoughts in his mind. What had they really accomplished? The farmhouse was gone, but the unease remained, as though the fire had only burned away the surface of a deeper threat.

Mike joined him a few minutes later, his expression grim. He slid into the booth across from TJ and studied his friend’s face for a moment before speaking. “Did you sleep?”

“Not much,” TJ admitted, his voice flat. “The dreams... they’re getting worse.”

Mike leaned forward, lowering his voice. “TJ, you need to let this go. The house is gone. Lily is gone. You need to move on.”

TJ looked up at him, his eyes hollow but intense. “It’s not that simple,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “She’s still with me, Mike. I can feel her.”

Mike opened his mouth to respond but stopped when he saw the look in TJ’s eyes. It was the same haunted expression TJ had worn since the fire, a mix of fear and determination that made Mike’s stomach turn. He didn’t know how to help his friend, but he knew this wasn’t over.

The motel’s parking lot was dimly lit that evening as TJ sat on the hood of Mike’s car, staring up at the stars. The medallion dangled from his hand, swinging gently in the cool breeze. Mike approached, a six-pack of beer in one hand and a look of concern on his face.

“You know, you’re starting to look like the cover of a bad paperback novel,” Mike said, handing TJ a bottle.

“What would the title be?” TJ asked, cracking a weak smile. “‘Man Haunted by Wife’s Ghost,’ or ‘How Not to Choose Real Estate’?”

Mike chuckled. “How about ‘Demons and Divorce: The TJ Carver Story’?”

TJ snorted, taking a sip of the beer. “Catchy. I’d buy that.”

They sat in silence for a while, the tension between them lightened by the faint buzz of alcohol and the vastness of the night sky.

“So, what’s next?” Mike finally asked. “You can’t keep bouncing between motels and nightmares forever.”

TJ stared at the medallion, its glow faint but steady. “I don’t know,” he admitted. “But I’m not running. Not anymore.”

Mike nodded, respecting the resolve in his friend’s voice. “Good. Because if you’re going to fight this thing, you’re not doing it alone.”

TJ looked at him, surprised. “You serious?”

“Dead serious,” Mike said. “You and I both know this isn’t over. And if there’s more out there like that house, someone’s got to do something about it.”

“We’re not exactly qualified,” TJ pointed out.

“You think anyone’s qualified to deal with this crap?” Mike shot back. “We survived. That’s got to count for something.”

TJ laughed, the sound bittersweet. “Alright, partner. Let’s see where this road takes us.”

Later that night, TJ lay on the motel bed, the medallion resting on the nightstand beside him. The room was silent except for the hum of the air conditioner. But in the quiet, he thought he heard something faint—a whisper, so soft it could have been imagined.

“You’re not free yet.”

His hand tightened into a fist, and he sat up sharply, staring at the medallion. Its glow pulsed faintly, almost like a heartbeat. TJ exhaled slowly, his resolve hardening.

“Not today,” he muttered, turning off the light. For the first time in weeks, he felt a flicker of determination that was stronger than fear.

The next morning, TJ stepped outside his motel room to the crisp morning air. The medallion hung loosely around his neck, its weight a reminder of the battle still ahead. As Mike pulled up in his car, TJ took one last look at the motel before climbing in.

“Where to?” Mike asked, gripping the wheel.

“Wherever the medallion pulls us next,” TJ replied, his voice steady.

The road stretched out before them, bathed in the golden hues of the rising sun. It was a long and uncertain journey waiting to unfold, filled with dangers and mysteries they couldn’t yet comprehend. But for the first time in a long while, TJ felt ready to face it. With Mike at his side and the medallion guiding them toward the unknown, they drove forward, determined to confront whatever shadows lay ahead.



PART 7 – FROM EMBERS

That afternoon, TJ decided to visit Professor Lewis in Cedar Rapids. He needed answers, and he needed them now. The drive was long and uneventful, the flat Iowa landscape stretching endlessly on either side of the highway. The fields blurred together, a monotonous backdrop to his racing thoughts. By the time he arrived at the university, the sun was beginning to set, casting long shadows over the imposing brick buildings.

Professor Lewis greeted TJ with a mixture of surprise and concern. “Mr. Carver,” he said, ushering him into his cluttered office. Books and artifacts crowded every available surface, and the faint scent of aged paper filled the air. “I wasn’t expecting you back so soon.”

“The house is gone,” TJ said bluntly, his voice heavy with exhaustion. “We burned it. But it’s not over.”

Lewis raised an eyebrow and motioned for TJ to sit. “What do you mean?”

TJ placed the medallion on the desk with a muted thud. “This. It’s still here. I can feel it.”

The professor picked up the medallion, turning it over in his hands. He studied it carefully, his brow furrowing. The intricate symbols etched into its surface seemed to shimmer faintly under the dim light of his desk lamp. “The symbol... it’s ancient. Tied to Lilith, yes, but it’s more than that. The bond it had to the house… it seems to have transferred to you.”

TJ’s heart sank. “Transferred? What does that mean?”

Lewis hesitated, clearly uncomfortable. “The medallion is a nexus of power. It anchors something to this realm. When the house was destroyed, the tether needed another connection. You, holding it at the time, became its new anchor.”

TJ sat back, the weight of Lewis’s words sinking in. He felt the medallion’s faint warmth in his chest, as if it was affirming the professor’s statement. “So it’s tied to me now,” he said, his voice edged with resignation. “What do I do?”

Mike entered the room, having lingered outside the door long enough to catch most of the conversation. “Okay, so we sever it,” he said, his tone as practical as ever. “What do we need? Salt? Holy water? A flamethrower?”

Lewis almost smiled, though his eyes remained grave. “Those might disrupt it temporarily, but this...” He turned the medallion over in his hands again, the etched symbols glinting faintly. “This is something else. Severing a connection like this isn’t a matter of tools. It’s knowledge—study. And that’s not something you can accomplish in a single ritual. This is a journey.”

TJ leaned forward, the weight of the professor’s words pressing down on him. “So we learn. We study. And we fight whatever comes next,” he said finally, his voice steadier than he expected.

Mike snorted. “You’re really diving into this whole paranormal thing, huh?”

“What choice do I have?” TJ said, spreading his hands. “This thing—whatever it is—isn’t just going to go away. And it’s not the only thing out there. If we don’t deal with it, someone else will suffer for it.”

Lewis nodded approvingly, his expression softening. “There’s wisdom in that. The world is full of shadows, Mr. Carver. You’ve encountered one, but there are countless others. If you’re serious about this, I can guide you. But I can’t promise we’ll find all the answers.”

Mike raised his hand. “Just to be clear, does this guidance come with health insurance? Because after last week, I feel like I’m going to need it.”

TJ grinned for the first time in days. “Don’t worry, Mike. We’ll get matching life insurance policies.”

The days that followed were a whirlwind of research and preparation. Professor Lewis introduced TJ and Mike to his labyrinthine collection of books and artifacts, teaching them to decipher ancient symbols and identify recurring patterns in paranormal phenomena. The medallion rested in a protective glass case on Lewis’s desk, but its faint glow seemed to follow TJ wherever he went, a constant reminder of its presence.

Lewis often observed TJ’s interactions with the medallion. There were moments when TJ would pause mid-conversation, his eyes drawn to the artifact as though it were calling to him. “Does it ever… feel like it’s speaking to you?” Lewis asked one evening, his tone cautious.

TJ hesitated, his fingers brushing against the glass case. “Not exactly speaking, but it’s there. In the back of my mind. Like it’s waiting for something.”

Lewis frowned, his concern evident. “Be careful, Mr. Carver. The medallion’s influence may grow stronger the longer you’re connected to it. It’s imperative that you remain in control.”

Weeks later, the trio launched their paranormal investigations service, "The Liminal Society," with an entirely online presence. They built a sleek website and a YouTube channel, branding themselves as the digital frontline for the unexplained. Their slogan, "Shining Light Into the Shadows," paired well with a minimalistic logo: a glowing medallion encircled by fire.

The website featured sections for case studies, client testimonials, and an interactive map where users could report paranormal sightings. Mike insisted on adding a blog titled "Mike's Corner," filled with irreverent posts about their adventures and DIY ghost-hunting tips.

“If nothing else, people will come for the content,” Mike said, leaning back in his chair as he edited a video of their first case. “Everyone loves a good ghost story.”

TJ nodded, scrolling through a growing list of emails from potential clients. The medallion’s faint glow pulsed steadily in its case, drawing his attention every so often. “Looks like we’ve already got interest. Missing hikers near Black Hollow Forest. Strange lights over a lake in Oregon. A haunted church in New England. Scientists lost deep within Still Cavern.”

Lewis adjusted his glasses, his tone serious. “We’ll need to prioritize. The medallion’s energy is still tied to you, TJ. It may react to certain cases more strongly than others.”

As TJ read through the details of Still Cavern, he noticed the medallion’s glow brighten faintly, almost as if it were responding to the words on the screen. He exchanged a glance with Lewis, who nodded knowingly.

“It’s reacting,” Lewis said. “This case might be directly tied to the medallion’s power.”

Mike groaned. “Of course it is. Nothing simple like a friendly ghost, huh? We’ve got to dive into caves now?”

TJ chuckled, shaking his head. “Looks like we don’t get to choose the easy ones. Let’s get ready.”

The preparation for Still Cavern was meticulous. Lewis provided them with a detailed list of supplies: protective charms, a portable EMF detector, and vials of blessed water. He insisted on conducting a cleansing ritual before they departed, explaining that it might shield them from the cavern’s darker energies.

Mike packed their equipment with exaggerated care, muttering under his breath about how he hadn’t signed up to be a spelunker. TJ caught his friend’s eye and grinned. “Come on, Mike. Think of the YouTube views.”

Mike rolled his eyes. “If we make it out alive, I’ll edit the best damn video you’ve ever seen.”

Lewis watched the exchange with a faint smile, though his eyes remained serious. “TJ,” he said, drawing him aside. “You must remain vigilant. The medallion’s influence is subtle, but it’s there.

If you ever feel it’s guiding you toward something dangerous, trust your instincts. It may not always have your best interests at heart.”

TJ’s grip on the medallion tightened. “Do you think it’s trying to control me?”

“Not control, necessarily,” Lewis said. “But it has its own agenda. Be mindful of that.”

As they loaded the car, TJ couldn’t shake the feeling that the medallion was anticipating the journey ahead. Its glow pulsed rhythmically, almost like a heartbeat. Somewhere in the world, new shadows stirred, waiting for those brave—or foolish—enough to seek them out.
