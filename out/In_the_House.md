I was there. Ground zero. In the place where it all happened.

The house stood empty, cold. The pantry was bare, the living room unfurnished—just the faint smell of old wood and dust hanging in the stale air.

Too neat. Too clean. Too… empty.

The hallway stretched into an abyss of shadow, the faint light from the kitchen barely a flicker against the darkness that devoured it. My breath came shallow, each step deeper into the house feeling like a dare I wasn’t sure I should’ve accepted.

With every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of wind rattling the windows, my heart stilled. My eyes darted around, trying to catch glimpses of something—anything—moving in the black void. But there was nothing.

Nothing but the sound.

A low hum. Faint, like the voice of an old woman, hollow with age and loneliness. It whispered eerie nursery rhymes, the kind no child remembers. The voice seemed to drift from the very walls themselves, mingling with the silence and pressing against my chest.

I didn’t turn back. Fear was a challenge now—something I couldn’t ignore. And there was a hundred-dollar bet on the line.

I groped blindly for a door, feeling the knob under my fingers, the brass cool against my sweat-soaked palms.

My heart hammered, but I refused to back down. The door creaked open, revealing only pitch-black darkness. The hum grew louder, then stopped—suddenly, as if it had noticed me, like it was waiting for something.

Was she in here?

Who was she again? The legend? The woman who killed her family ten years ago, locked away for insanity, only to be released and return to this same house?

I stepped inside, against every instinct screaming at me to turn around.

And then I saw it. A faint, sickly light, like the faintest sliver of moonlight. It illuminated her face—twisted, haggard, her skin like crumpled paper. Her eyes—were those my eyes?

I froze, my breath catching in my throat.

She looked just like me.

What was I doing?

I stumbled backward, but the walls closed in. The house, the same house I had entered on a dare, seemed to pulse with a strange energy. I felt… detached. Like I wasn’t even in control of my own body. I glanced around, and the wreckage of my family seemed to blur in and out of focus.

My father—dead. My sister—gone. The house, broken. Windows shattered, furniture overturned. Blood, or was it just rust? I couldn’t tell anymore.

Did I do this?

The thought crept in slowly, but then it came crashing in, a brutal certainty. The policeman who arrived—the look on his face—he thought so. He had to.

Did I do this?

The cuffs bit into my wrists as they dragged me away, but even as the door closed behind me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I wasn’t done here. That the house still called to me, empty and inviting, daring me to come back. To uncover the truth buried in its hollow walls.

And then, from the darkness, I heard it again.

A faint hum.

It was the same. Just like before.

But this time, it wasn’t the old woman’s voice. It was mine.
