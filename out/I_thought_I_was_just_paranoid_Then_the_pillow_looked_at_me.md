Here is a story about how drugs ruined my life, but not in the way you think. 

I was having a hard time that year when I lost my job. I’m not a very sociable person, so all my friends, except for one, were those at the office. And that one friend, let’s call her Alice, she, well, isn’t very sociable herself - we used to meet for a drink every other month or so. 

So, now I was pretty much alone all the time, smoking tons of weed along with playing video games, with only my two rats, Chonky and Wonky, keeping me silent company.

To get another job, I needed to update my portfolio. I’m a 3D artist, and the tools evolve fast. I had a lot of catching up to do after working five years on the same project. 

At that point I was basically working at home, which consisted of one room. I was working there. Eating there. Gaming there. Falling asleep and waking up in the same goddamn room with that unbearably boring creamy-white wallpaper, every day.

This miserable lifestyle took a toll on my mental health. I was feeling trapped, alone, useless. I felt like I’ve lost five years of my life just doing the job and it never even occurred to me to improve along the way. I’ve realized that I haven’t created anything outside of work for years. 

What kind of artist am I if I am not passionate about art? Do I even like making art? Or did I just follow the path my parents imagined for me?

I was in a pretty bad place, and there was nobody around to challenge these thoughts and steer me out of it. And I felt so, so alone. To the point where I would start crying in the middle of the street at the sight of a dog with its human, jealous of the bond they share. 

I only left the house to get weed. There are several forests in the city, and I would often choose them for my pickups, or “treasures”, as we call it here. In my case, that name is twice as ironic.

On that warm spring evening I decided not to wait for the night and headed out, looking forward to taking a walk in the woods and shooting some nice pictures of sunset. The place was not too far from me, a patch of woods that miraculously was not swallowed by the city around it, the Bald Mountain. The name always confused me, it wasn’t really a mountain, just a big hill.

I chose a new route and entered the forest from a different side, one I never fully explored. After about 20 minutes of walking I found a clearing with what looked like logs standing along the perimeter, and after coming closer I saw that they were totems, most of them resembling bearded men with strict looks on their faces. Some of them had runes carved into them, some were painted in bright colors, and the whole place was definitely looked after. In the middle of the clearing there was a huge 6 meter tall square statue, or altar, idk. 

Cool, I thought, there are still people who are keeping the traditional religion alive. I wasn’t willing to meet them right now though, so I decided I would make a quick circle around this weird shrine and then return to my objective. 

The place was peaceful and quiet, and I started to zone out, feeling strangely immersed in its ancient atmosphere. As I approached the altar, I realized it was built from several totems stacked together, all painted red. One face, in particular, caught my eye - a man with a bushy beard, wearing a traditional Ukrainian hat with a carved rune. He glared at the world with cold rage, and the upper half of his face was painted black.

I squinted, trying to make out the details beneath the black paint, when I realized how dark it had gotten. The air was unnaturally still, and the birds had gone silent. Maybe they’d settled for the night, but it wasn’t that late yet. I checked my phone: 21:50. Confused, I blinked. That couldn’t be right. It was just after 19:00  when I arrived. Unease crept in. Usually, I didn’t mind being out in the woods at night, but something about this - about the time jump, the silence  - was different. My nerves were starting to fray.

I checked the map again and hurried away from the shrine, eager to finish what I’d come for. The spot turned out to be much closer than I’d thought, just behind a stand of trees. I could’ve sworn it was supposed to be at the top of the hill, but the screen said otherwise. I shrugged it off as a mistake and found a stick to start digging. Usually, these pickups aren’t buried deep, but no matter how hard I searched, there was nothing.

My annoyance grew as I dug. Great, no pickup tonight. I muttered curses at the courier, standing up to dust off my jeans and text the seller about the empty spot. I sent him photos from the site and my geolocation. 

I knew there wouldn’t be a response right now, so there was nothing else to do but go home. Situations like this wreck me - just thinking about being sober alone at home sent my anxiety through the roof. Desperate for a solution, I texted Alex. No luck. I scrolled through my contacts, but there wasn’t anyone who would hang out at this time. This was just sad, I felt pathetic.

  \- God, I don’t wanna be alone, - I groaned in frustration.

And as I was finishing the phrase, I thought I heard something. A hoarse sound - like a sigh, but deeper. Not human, more like a large animal, like a cow, maybe. It came from above.

I froze, listening. *What the hell was that?*

I stood there, heart pounding, straining to hear anything else, but the forest had fallen back into that unnerving silence. There’s probably a stable uphill, for horseback walks… Many tourists here… Then, suddenly, I felt something like.. a presence? You know, when the air feels and sounds different? 

Without wasting another second, I turned and hurried back toward the path, trying not to look scared *(why?)* and telling myself along the way that it was just primal instincts making me feel that... thing. *We got spooked, adrenaline rushed in and did its job, nothing crazy. Happened to us a million times, remember? No big deal.*

The forest thinned out, the path opening to the street where the city lights twinkled faintly in the distance. I finally stepped out from the oppressive quiet of the woods and hurried down the road, away from Bald Mountain. I glanced back for a second to confirm what I surely already knew - nobody was there. By the time I reached my apartment building, I felt a little more settled.

Inside, I washed my hands and slumped onto the couch, staring blankly at the wall. Chonky and Wonky scurried around in their cage, blissfully unaware of my weird evening. 

 \- Hey there, little buddies, - I crouched down and opened their tiny hatch. Chonky, a fat black rat, was nibbling at a treat in a far corner, and Wonky, a smaller white one with a black hood, came out to greet me, but dashed away as soon as he caught my scent. 

 \- Oh come on, -  I sighed. Probably had gotten into some cat piss while I was digging around - they always reacted like that for a couple of days after I came back from my friend’s place.

I pulled out my phone, glancing at the time again: 23:30. Well, at least time made sense.

I tossed the phone onto the table and came back to the couch, staring at the ceiling. My mind wandered back to that sound, that strange sigh from the trees. I knew I should let it go - it was probably nothing.

I thought back to when I was a kid, playing some dumb imagination game about unicorns in the woods with my friends. I could swear I heard something similar - a giant horse snorting above us, as if it was up in the sky. I remember looking up, convinced I’d see something there. My friends didn’t seem to notice it, though. 

Later, I wrote it off as my overactive childhood imagination, or my brain misinterpreting some other noise as a horse snort. But tonight… I wasn’t so sure.

I scoffed. Nah, that’s ridiculous, there is no such thing as supernatural. 

But another part of me couldn’t shake off the weird feeling. 

Feeling that something had followed me home.

I needed to get my mind off this nonsense, and I knew falling asleep won’t be easy since I didn’t have my daily dose today. So, I opted for video games, hoping I'd play until I passed out. 

I woke up in darkness, with the faint light of dawn creeping in outside. My neck was aching  from sleeping in the chair. I stood, groaning as I stretched my stiff body, and shuffled to the bathroom. I like moving around the apartment without turning on the lights - it’s one of those little games I play to make everyday life feel a bit less dull. 

From the bathroom doorway, I glanced down the long hallway that led to the front door. My eyes mindlessly scanned the area. The jacket rack looked different, almost like there was a pale spot near the middle of it, and something else was off. A thought started to form, but my mind shut it down before it could fully take shape.

*Just lighting tricks... and the yellow purse on the rack*, I explained to myself. My sleepy brain, now in full denial mode, eagerly accepted the explanation. Without another thought, I went to bed.

I remember being trapped in a nightmare that night. Surely some of you have been there - caught in a cycle of dreams where each feels more real than the last.

So I woke up and stayed under the blanket for a while, staring at that stupid wallpaper. My eyes relaxed and my vision blurred, and suddenly, a dark-grey ornament appeared on the wall. My first thought was *Huh, cool.* Then horror set in as I realized this wasn’t normal.

I woke up. Wallpaper looked as it should. I sighed in relief and headed to the kitchen for water. While sipping from my green Rick and Morty glass, my eyes wandered around, and I noticed that the wallpaper here has the ornament I saw in the dream earlier - but this one was golden. I smiled. *So that’s where my brain got it* \- *this wallpaper looks way nicer than the one in the bedroom.* 

Then, as if it heard my thoughts, the pattern began to morph. It pushed out from the wall, twisting and reshaping itself into some strange metallic structure. It kept growing and unfolding its infinite dimensions, and I stared into it, unable to look away, and it stared back at me.

I woke up with mixed feelings. Have you ever dreamt about being in love, and even after waking up, you could still feel it, even if that was your arch enemy? It was like that, but… dark. As if I was charmed by some black magic or something. 

My mind kept returning to that golden structure, but some noise yanked me out of it. I got out of bed, stepped into the hallway and looked at the front door - and it wasn’t there. Instead, stripes of thick oilcloth hung in its place, like the staff passage curtains in supermarkets. The doorframe was wrecked.

I froze mid-step.

Then, a guy walked in.

 \- What the fuck?! - I yelled.

 \- Oh, sorry, I thought you knew. - He stepped back, raising his hands. - The landlord’s replacing the doors. 

 \- What?! - anger washed over me, I was mad beyond reasoning, blinded by red mist before my eyes and black rage rising up from the deepest corners of my soul.

 \- Y-yeah, they said you lost your keys in the woods or something? And they are done with it. No keys n-needed now, ey? - he proudly glanced at the oilcloth curtain with a genuine smile, like the news he just gave me wasn't totally crazy.

I was staring at the floor, trembling and clenching my fists, ready to lunge at him, when the guy let out a quiet chuckle that quickly grew into insane cackling. I looked up at him, and even before my mind registered what I was seeing, my body already reacted and jumped away, falling to the floor. 

If someone had gotten a photo of us at that moment, it would seem like just a really unlucky shot. But in the continuity, it was horrifying. He was frozen in place, not just standing in one place, but *completely still -* he wasn’t moving at all, like he was on pause, and his mouth was wide open, frozen in an endless yawn so wide that his jaws were about to snap. And he never stopped cackling, as I crept away from him in panic with my sweaty palms slipping on that mirror-smooth flooring. 

I woke up again, this time to the sound of my own scream. 

Okay, okay, I was okay.

Jesus fucking Christ, I was finally awake.

But was I really? 

I pinched my cheek. Nothing. Slapped myself. Okay, this felt real. But so had everything else.

Breathing heavily, I stepped into the hallway. The door was back where it should be. No oilcloth. No guy. I glanced at the coat rack. My yellow purse wasn’t hanging there as I’d seen at night - it was lying on the cabinet instead. My chest tightened. Why was it moved? Did I move it? Did someone else?

*Either I’m still dreaming,* I thought, *or last night’s bathroom trip wasn’t real and I didn’t see the purse.*

I’ve read stuff on lucid dreaming in the past, so I tried to run a reality test and flipped the light switch. It worked. But that alone didn’t mean I was awake.

I grabbed my phone and looked at the screen. It read: 12:28, May 19. I locked the screen, unlocked it and looked again. 12:28, May 19. If I was dreaming, either the time and date wouldn’t be the same the second time I looked, or I would’ve had trouble reading at all.

So, I was awake, and the bathroom trip was a dream. 

I relaxed a bit, satisfied that at least something made sense, and headed to the kitchen. Reached into the cupboard for my green glass, and… it wasn’t there. I clearly remember putting it in the cupboard yesterday. Could it be?..

I slowly turned around. Yup, there it was - on the table, where I left it in my cycle of nightmares this morning. 

My brain stopped for a moment, overwhelmed by all the weirdness and contradictions. There had to be a rational explanation to all this shit. I went with withdrawal syndrome - being a heavy smoker, it was only natural for the negative effects to kick in so quickly and be so intense. Strange vivid dreams, confusion, weakened memory and cognitive abilities - all are withdrawal symptoms. 

I exhaled, proud of my ability to rationalize literally anything, and proceeded with my morning routine. I did check the front door and the purse again though, just for good measure.

And after I was done with my breakfast, it was time to see if the seller replied anything. 

“Dude, you were looking in a completely different place.” the text said. “It’s not even close to the coordinates.” 

 \- What do you mean?! - I yelled at the screen, frustrated. The only way I would be looking in the wrong place would be if the coordinates from the courier were wrong. 

Damn, I knew it. It wasn’t a mistake yesterday, was it? I *did* see the marker to be on top of the hill, but it was glitching… It moved closer to…

The SHRINE.

The memories flooded my mind. The weird time jump, the unnerving silence, that creepy-ass totem-dude and the sigh from the sky… 

I fell back into the chair, recalling the events of last night and putting all my effort into making it sound rational. 

So I decided to take a walk in the woods and hang out at the shrine. I was not in a hurry and stayed longer, hypnotized by the shrine’s vibe - thus the “time jump.” The silence - well, it was late, and I kind of woke from trance, so that’s why it seemed weird. The sigh probably belonged to a real horse, or it was just a rustle of leaves or some other sound that my brain mistook as a “sigh.” And the feeling of presence was already explained by the adrenaline rush.

There you go, perfectly normal explanation. 

*What about the pickup’s location?* 

GPS app glitch, just needs to be recalibrated.

Which means… I can still get my treasure! The seller said I looked in the wrong spot, right? And now, in the light of day, I will definitely find it and finally snap out of this horrible state. 

My inner addict took full control and was on cloud nine, shoving all what was left of my worries deep down. I got dressed and hurried out, and as I grabbed the keys from the cabinet, I tossed that damn yellow purse into the drawer. Fuck that thing.

In the forest, I went along the usual, shorter path which I knew well, and this time I was looking at the map the whole time. As expected, I found my pickup in a matter of seconds, and ran home, happily anticipating hours and hours of high and gaming.

Inside, I had a quick wash, headed straight to my room and smoked my precious weed. A sweet wave of calm swept through my body and mind, and I melted in my chair. 

I was finally myself. 

Rats drew my attention. I definitely wasn’t going to play with them in the next 12 hours, so I decided to let them out free roaming. I knelt down to open the cage, and as I stretched my finger to tickle their bellies, they darted away, just like yesterday.

 \- God damn it, how do you get rid of this shit, - I muttered, heading to wash my hands again. 

So, I’m crazy about tiny pillows, and my place is stuffed with them. All kinds of prints: patterns, emblems, video game characters, you name it. I don’t really use them as pillows, they just sit there on display.

Heading out, one small detail stopped me cold. One of the characters on the pillow was *looking.* Not at me, but just past me, with the cartoonish unmoving eyes that definitely weren’t meant to invoke such dread. I stood there for what seemed like an eternity, a million thoughts racing through my mind as I was desperately clinging to sanity and trying to convince myself that I’m not seeing that. 

Slowly, moving a nanometer at once, I took a step aside to change angle and try to make sure that my eyes were just playing tricks on me. And suddenly the pillow’s gaze turned right at me. I screamed and ran out of the apartment, barefoot and in underwear. 

Everything from there is a fuzz. I think I met a neighbor and begged her to come with me and examine the pillow, but as she came in and noticed thick fog that smelled of weed, she chose to retreat, probably thinking I’m in the middle of a bad trip.

I stood in the doorway, terrified to step further. My knees struggled to keep steady, and I collapsed on the floor. 

*I don’t wanna go in there, I don’t wanna go in there, I don’t wanna… -* I heard in my head. 

I spent that night in the hallway, scared to breathe and let - whatever that was - notice me.

By the morning nothing else happened, and I started to think that I really just had a bad trip and got paranoid. I slowly got up and crawled back to the bedroom, wanting to both ignore the pillow and take another look at it. So I did the latter. I *had* to make sure it was a regular boring pillow. To my great relief, it seemed lifeless and still. It didn’t make the anxiety fully go away, but my need for the PC was stronger. 

I decided to spend some time working on my portfolio and dove in, satisfied with my decision to do something worthwhile. 

That day was uneventful. The tension eased, and I almost convinced myself it had all been in my head.

But then the sun set.

The apartment went dark, and I was moving around with no lights, as usual. I went to use the bathroom, sitting with the door open, when I saw it - that pale spot on the coat rack. Good thing I was already taking a shit, because the fear hit me like a punch to the chest. 

How the hell was that goddamn purse back on the rack again?

I hit the light switch. The bulb flickered once. Then stayed on.

And there it was.

Not the purse.

Something else.

A tripod stood in the hallway like it had always been there. On top of it, suspended in absolute stillness, was a grey sphere. Glossy. Porcelain-smooth. Too clean, like it was stripped of reality.

It had a face. A *furious* face. Twisted with hate. The same face from the shrine - seething, wide-eyed, mouth stretched into something between a grimace and a scream. It stared straight into me, unblinking.

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

It was like some kind of cosmic joke. It was absurd. Ridiculous, even. A floating head on a tripod.

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at that thing. Maybe a second. Maybe an hour.

It didn’t move. It didn’t need to - its presence filled the hallway like smoke - thick and choking, even in silence.

I desperately wanted to get out of the apartment*,* but the thing was guarding the front door, and I wouldn’t dare to come near it. 

Eventually, I backed away. One step. Another.

It didn’t follow.

My mind wanted safety. And in my brain, warped and desperate, that meant my bedroom. My bed. My blanket. My pillow.

God, the pillow.

I paused at the doorway. The shadows inside looked thicker now - like they had been waiting. My feet didn’t want to cross the threshold.

Because if the hallway had the face, then the pillow had the eyes.

But I couldn’t stay in the hallway. I couldn’t stand under that thing’s gaze for another second.

So I did what made no sense and yet made all the sense in the world:  I went back into the room I’d fled from yesterday. 

I didn’t turn on the lights. I didn’t look at the pillow.

I climbed into bed sideways, like a trespasser in my own life, and curled up without letting my head touch anything. I’ve never prayed before, but now I was begging all known gods to let me fall asleep and wake up into a world where it was all just a nightmare. But part of me knew that wasn’t gonna happen. I was finally accepting the grim reality - something horrifying was going on.

I must have dozed off at some point, curled like a cat in the corner of the mattress. 

A soft, familiar pressure on my chest stirred me awake—my rats had come to sleep with me.

Amidst all the horror, I had completely forgotten they existed. 

But here they were. Warm, small, breathing.

Their presence soothed something raw in me. For a moment, I felt okay.

I reached out and scratched Wonky behind the ear. He twitched, just like always. Then I stroked Chonky’s back.

But something was wrong.

My hand kept going. Past where his body should have ended.

Still fur. Still ribs. Still him.

And then - I felt something brush against my foot.

Tiny claws, soft and familiar, tickled across my toes.

My chest locked.

That meant... his hind legs were by my *feet*.

But his front paws were still resting on my chest.

I pulled my hand back like it had fallen into a hole.

I didn’t look. I didn’t want to see how long he’d become. I wanted to believe he was still my Chonky. Maybe I could pet him, call his name, and it would all stop. But I didn’t. I just waited.

He was still nuzzling against my chest like nothing was wrong.

But it *was*.

I could feel it. Not in his body - but in his gaze.

He was staring at me.

Not like the hallway moon-face - that had been pure malice, a pressure like burning.

This was different. Quieter. 

But no less wrong.

It was the kind of stare that waits for you to notice it. The kind that *knows* you will.

I kept my eyes shut, hoping the darkness would keep me safe. But eventually, I had to look.

I opened them slowly, glancing past him at first - toward the wall, the blanket, the shadow at the edge of the bed. Then my gaze drifted back.

He was smiling.

A wide, unmistakable smile. With a human mouth. Filled with human teeth.

I bolted from the room before he could open his mouth. I didn’t stop until I reached the kitchen balcony and slammed the door behind me.

That’s where I’m writing this now.

Out here, it’s quiet. Still.

But I know the thing is everywhere now. Every object, every piece of furniture, every shadowed corner - they’re all smiling.

Not watching. Not breathing. Just smiling.

The balcony is the only place left that feels… empty.

But I don’t think it will stay that way for long.

I think the walls will start smiling soon too.

After all - I did wish not to be alone.

Y.
