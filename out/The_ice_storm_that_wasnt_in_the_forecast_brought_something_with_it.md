We got here three days ago. It already feels like it’s been weeks. The drive up was long but quiet, all two-lane roads winding through mountains that looked more like walls than hills. The kind that make you feel small.

My wife, Marcy, sat beside me with the map folded across her lap. She kept pointing out trail names and creeks we’d pass, but half of them weren’t on the GPS. Our dog, Scout, slept in the back seat with his head on the cooler, and Luke followed behind us in his truck, hauling most of the gear. It was supposed to be a small vacation — four of us total, though Luke’s wife, Jamie, couldn’t make it until the next morning.

We stopped for gas near a little town at the base of the range. One of those places with a single pump and a sign that’s been sun-bleached for a decade. The man inside was old, with hands that looked like bark, and he told Luke the weather “turns strange up there.” Said forecasts don’t mean much when you’re that high. “You’ll know when it changes,” he said, “you’ll smell it first.”

Luke laughed it off, but the guy didn’t. He just looked at us like he was thinking something he didn’t want to say out loud. I remember the air being colder there, even though we were still in sunlight. The wind carried this dry taste, like metal and pine.

The road after that narrowed into a path more than a highway. The higher we climbed, the less we talked. Marcy rolled the window down once to take a picture, and the cold that hit my arm felt heavier than it should have. I know that sounds stupid — cold’s just cold — but it felt like it had weight to it.

When we reached the cabin, the sun was barely hanging over the ridge. The place looked smaller than I expected. Just two rooms and a porch, sitting in the middle of an open slope surrounded by black trees. The snowline was maybe a hundred yards uphill, but the ground was frozen solid already.

Luke said his grandfather built it in the seventies. “Didn’t even have power for the first few years,” he said, knocking on one of the logs. “He just liked the quiet.” We unloaded the gear, got the generator running, and by the time the fire caught, the temperature had dropped fast enough that our breath hung thick in the cabin.

That first night felt good, though. We cooked over the fire, told stories, listened to the wood pop in the stove. It was the kind of silence you don’t get anywhere else, the kind that doesn’t feel empty. 

Luke said he used to come up here as a kid. “You can hear everything when it freezes,” he said. “The trees groan, the ground cracks. It sounds alive.”
Marcy laughed and asked if that was supposed to be comforting. He grinned and said, “You’ll get used to it.”

We slept fine. Scout curled up at the foot of the bed and didn’t make a sound all night. I remember waking up once to what I thought was a branch snapping, but when I listened, I couldn’t hear anything else. Just the faint ticking of the stove cooling down.

The next morning started colder. The sky was white, but not like snow — more like a sheet of glare. The trees were wet, glistening, even though it hadn’t rained. When I stepped off the porch, the dirt cracked like glass under my boots.

Luke was outside already, checking his phone. “Forecast says clear skies all week,” he said, holding it up. “Perfect timing.” Marcy laughed and said maybe we’d actually lucked out for once. None of us thought to question why the air hurt to breathe.

By midmorning, a haze had settled over the trees. You could still see through it, but the color drained from everything. Even Scout went quiet, tail low, watching the ridge. Luke said it was just a cold front moving through. He didn’t sound convinced.

Around noon, the wind picked up, but only for a minute. It came hard, out of nowhere, sharp enough to make the cabin groan. Then it stopped. The silence after was heavier than before, like the air itself had frozen solid.

That’s when Luke said it. “You smell that?”
At first, I didn’t know what he meant. Then I caught it — that metallic edge again, stronger now, mixed with something else. Not rot exactly, but earthy and sweet. Like wet stone. He smiled, uneasy, and said, “Guess it’s changing.”

We ate lunch inside with the lantern burning even though it was still daylight. The windows had started fogging on the inside, and when I wiped one clear, the frost pattern didn’t melt. It just sat there, like a print in glass.

By afternoon, it felt colder inside than out. The fire burned high but didn’t throw much heat. Luke said he’d check the generator, but I told him to wait. Something about the light outside — flat and gray, like distance didn’t exist — made me feel sick to look at.

I tried calling Jamie to see if she’d left yet, but there was no signal. Marcy tried too, same thing. We told ourselves the ridge must’ve blocked it, that she’d show up the next morning. But part of me already knew something wasn’t right.

That night, the sound started.

It started just after dark.

We’d been playing cards by the lantern because the fire wasn’t doing much. Every time the flames dropped, the air felt like it was pulling the warmth out of us. Scout lay under the table, restless, his ears twitching. When he stood up and growled at the wall, we all froze.

There was a noise outside — low, uneven, hard to place. Not the groan of trees or ice cracking. It sounded deeper, like something shifting its weight in the snow. Luke got up first, grabbed the flashlight, and opened the door before I could tell him not to.

The beam caught nothing but frost. Every branch glittered like glass, and the ground reflected light in a way that didn’t look real. I remember thinking it looked like the forest had been dipped in mercury. Scout whined and pressed himself against Marcy’s legs, tail between his.

Luke stepped out onto the porch and swept the flashlight across the treeline. The beam flickered for a second, dimmed, then came back. He swore quietly and said the batteries must be dying. They were new.

The noise stopped while he was out there. Everything did. Even the small sounds you expect — wind, creaking wood — just vanished. He turned back toward us and said, “It’s fine. Probably a branch coming down.” Then, from somewhere out past the trees, something answered.

It wasn’t an echo. It was the same sound, but longer this time, dragging itself across the valley. Luke came inside fast and locked the door behind him. Nobody said a word for a long time after that.

When we finally went to bed, I couldn’t sleep. Every time I started to drift, I heard faint cracking outside. Like something walking, stopping, walking again. Marcy whispered that it was just the ice expanding, but her voice was too tight. She didn’t believe it either.

Sometime around two, Scout started barking. Not the kind of bark he used for deer or raccoons. It was sharp and panicked, and he wouldn’t stop. I pulled the curtain back just a little and saw something move behind the trees.

It was tall. That’s the only thing I can say for sure. The beam from the lantern caught just enough to show a shape standing still, almost blending into the ice. Then it shifted, and I realized it wasn’t standing — it was hunched. Watching.

When I blinked, it was gone.

The next morning, everything outside was coated in another layer of ice. The windows had to be hit with a hammer handle just to see through them. The power from the generator was weak, sputtering. 

Luke said he’d check the fuel line once the sun was up, but the sky never really brightened. It stayed the same flat color, like the light was coming from inside the clouds.

Marcy made coffee on the stove, and the smell felt strange — too warm for the air around us. She asked if anyone else’s head hurt, said the pressure felt wrong. I told her it was just altitude, but mine hurt too.

Around midmorning, Luke found tracks by the porch. At least that’s what we called them. They weren’t prints exactly — more like long impressions in the ice, almost melted into it. The shape reminded me of a hand, but stretched. The fingers, if that’s what they were, were uneven.

He said maybe a bear had slipped. I wanted to believe that, but bears don’t leave drag marks that long, and they don’t make the ground cold enough to frost over a boot print beside them.

We argued about going down the mountain to find Jamie or a signal. Luke didn’t want to leave until the weather settled. Marcy said it looked like it already had — and that maybe we’d just gotten spooked. She was trying to calm everyone down, but she couldn’t stop glancing at the windows.

At lunch, we heard something fall in the woods. A deep crash, like a tree giving way. The sound echoed for too long. Scout started whining again and paced back and forth in front of the door. When I opened it, a gust of air hit me that felt colder than anything I’ve ever felt.

It burned my skin even through my gloves. The porch steps were covered in frost that hadn’t been there ten minutes before. When I leaned down, I noticed something in the ice — small black flecks, like ash or dirt, arranged in a spiral.

I scraped at it with my boot, but it didn’t come off. It was inside the ice, sealed beneath it like it had grown that way.

We stayed inside the rest of the day. Luke kept checking his watch, like he couldn’t believe how slowly the hours were passing. Marcy read aloud from an old paperback she’d brought, just to fill the silence. I didn’t hear a word of it. I kept watching the frost crawl higher up the windows.

By evening, we knew Jamie wasn’t coming. There hadn’t been any sign of her all day — no headlights, no noise from the road. The ice was thick enough now that we couldn’t open the back door. The air inside had this faint smell of metal, almost like blood.

Scout wouldn’t eat. He sat by the window and stared at the same patch of trees. Once, just before dark, I thought I saw something move there again. Only this time, it didn’t disappear right away.
It swayed slightly, side to side, like it was breathing. Then the sky dimmed, and it was gone.

That night the wind came back, but it didn’t sound like wind. It whistled low through the cracks in the boards, pulsing in short breaths. Scout barked once and then crawled under the table, trembling hard enough that I could hear his collar rattle.

Luke kept saying it was just the storm. He tried to start the generator again, but the engine only coughed. Every time he stepped toward the door, the sound outside stopped — like whatever was out there was waiting for him to move first.

Marcy lit another lantern. The flame bent toward the window even though the air was still. I told her to turn it off, but she said she couldn’t stand the dark. We sat together on the couch, boots still on, bags packed in case the roof came down.

Sometime after midnight, the wall near the stove popped. Not from heat, but from cold — a hard crack that made the whole room shake. Luke swore and ran to check the pipes. When he opened the back door, a blast of air hit us that felt like needles.

He froze in the doorway. I asked what he saw, but he didn’t answer right away. Then he said, “There’s something standing in the snow.”

I thought he was joking until I saw his face. I walked over, pulled the door wider, and looked past him.
It was standing maybe thirty yards away, near the first line of trees. At first I thought it was a man. It was shaped like one — two legs, long arms, head tilted slightly — but it was too tall. Eight feet at least, maybe ten. The limbs were so thin they looked like they’d snap if it moved too fast.

The knees bent the wrong way, jointed backward like a bird’s. Its arms hung down past its knees, fingers sharp and narrow. I could see ribs pressing through its chest, skin stretched tight like wet paper. The surface of it shimmered — not hair, not scales, just a sheen like thin ice.

Then it lifted its head. Two yellow eyes caught the lantern light and reflected it back. They didn’t blink. Behind its shoulders, something shifted. For a second I thought they were shadows, but they moved — slow and deliberate — like wings folding against its back.

Luke whispered, “What the hell is that?” but none of us had an answer.

The thing crouched, almost folding in half. I heard the snow compress under its weight. The wind blew harder, and sheets of it blurred everything beyond the porch. I could still see the glow of its eyes, bright and steady through the white.

It stayed there, hunched low, until the storm began to swallow the clearing. The more the snow came down, the less of it we could see — just those eyes, floating in the dark like lanterns. Then it began to move.

It didn’t walk away at first. It stood, straightening in one slow, unnatural motion until its head brushed the lowest branches of the pines. The wings unfurled just a little, heavy with ice. And then it turned — its body shifting toward the trees, but its head didn’t move. It stayed locked on us the whole time.

Even as the snow covered it, I could feel it watching. Like something behind glass. Then it was gone. Just a black shape dissolving into the white.
Luke shut the door and dropped the bar across it. None of us spoke. Scout whined once and then curled up so tight his nose disappeared under his tail.

We waited another hour before we moved. The wind screamed so loud it shook the lantern on its hook. Marcy sat by the stove with her hands pressed to her face. I tried to warm my fingers, but the tips had already gone numb. They stayed pale long after the fire came back.

I told myself it was just frostbite. That what we saw was some animal caught in the storm, and the cold had made our eyes play tricks. But even now, when I blink, I can still see those yellow lights in the dark.
We tried to sleep, but every sound outside made us jolt awake. The creak of a branch, the slam of loose shutters — all of it sounded like footsteps.

By morning, the world was buried. The thermometer on the porch was frozen solid. The storm hadn’t been in any forecast we checked.

Luke wanted to hike out right then, but the trees were bent under ice, the path gone. Marcy begged him to wait until it cleared. He said fine, one more night, and then we’re leaving.

That was yesterday.

The ice hasn’t melted. If anything, it’s thicker. 

We’re running out of food and the snow on the roof is getting heavier and heavier. I need to fix both problems but it’s still out there, I can feel it. I don’t know what to do. Can someone please help?
