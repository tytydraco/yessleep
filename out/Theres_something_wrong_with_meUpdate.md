I've discovered the truth...Now it's too late...

Hello again, I'm surprised that I've been able to make an update. I thought once that man broke in, I was a goner. He beat me up pretty well, but he didn't kill me...or even break anything, however...I am missing an eye now.

It's all weird because I don't feel anything like that. I mean I feel something...just not anything, or any pain that's intense.

Over the hours, I've discovered there's another one..another human-like being in my home. I don't know where he is, but I often hear him say: "Do you remember?" In a deep masculine voice.

Every time I hear it, I get reminded of traumas from my past...and my head hurts. I know it's not the man in the trenchcoat because his voice is different.

I haven't been able to leave my house, or even call for help, The tall man in the trench coat destroyed my phone...and if I even try to leave, he'll drag me back inside anyway. There is no escape for me...

While I've been trapped in here, I've been finding out more about these strange men. The man I cannot see seems to be able to converse with me, and I've been asking him questions, he'll only answer a few, but hey something is better than nothing.

I asked him what he was, and he answered: "We are a family."

I asked him what his name was, and he answered: "I am Agredium."

I asked him about the man in the Trench coat, and he answered: "He is Erratium..."

So, I'm making progress in getting answers. They have names, and they seem to work for someone else...or something else.

I then asked him why they were doing this to me, and he answered: "You are part of the family, this is how we treat family..."

The other answers were weird, but this one actually unsettled me. Family? Family of who? I tried to get more answers, but the man I cannot see went quiet and continued his "Do you Remember?" spiel.

Over time, The man in the Trenchcoat has grown less hostile. He still slaps me around from time to time, but he's not as violent. He seems happy, and I don't know why, I can hear him giggling away at nothing, and it's actually creeping me out.

My body's also been changing, not from the many injuries. I've been growing paler, and skinner, and the empty socket my eye was once in, opened and started leaking a black ooze. I think I'm transforming into something horrible...Time feels like it's slowing down, but little time is passing me...what is going on?!

Just three hours ago I heard The trenchcoat man whispering "Sister..." in that dual voice of his. The man I cannot see also seems very happy, speaking about 'family', and another being known as 'father'.

I decided to sleep, my nap only lasted 20 minutes but it felt like two hours. I woke up to find a pocket watch on my lap, it had an elongated hand on it, and it was also leaking black ooze. I looked around and my home was dark, with a red glow in it. I went to my living room and I found another being standing over the tall Trench coat man, as well as another man with a top hat and a fancy suit, with a messy beard and dress shoes, (perhaps this is the man from the shadows.) This creature was tall and had what appeared to be worms for hair, and a porcelain mask. It looked at me and walked up to me, its long arms grabbing me and lifting me into the air, but I couldn't move...or I didn't want to...

It spoke to me, and I listened to it. Its voice sounded motherly and fatherly at the same time. like a parental figure,  I felt so...comforted by its presence, and the other two men did as well. They were revering this being, staring as he held me in the air.

"You drank my blood...now you will join us...JOIN MY FAMILY. For I am now your new father, Erratas." It said, before tearing my left sleeve off and sinking his finger into my arm. I didn't scream, I just felt dizzy, and euphoric before passing out.

Once I woke up, I found myself in the middle of the three beings. They all looked down in unison and I stood up. All I could hear was ticking from my pocket watch.

"Do you like your gift?" Erratas said. "It suits you well..."

I didn't respond...how could I? What was I supposed to say to something so surreal?

"Your name is no longer Anna... your name is now, Time Keeper...You will help me grow my family, by spreading my blood." The creature said before he removed the smaller minute hand from my watch, stuck his hand in my empty eye socket, and stabbed my brain with the watch hand. He twisted t a few times before pulling his hand out. It didn't hurt, it felt weird, but not painful. He sat me back in the middle of the triangle of mysterious beings. They looked down at me as if I was a newborn child, just processing my new environment.

I am now one of them, and I have a new purpose. To help Erratas grow his family, with my new brothers, Erratium and Agredium. I don't know why I have to help him...but I do, or something will happen. I don't know what will happen, but something will happen. I just feel it in the presence of Erratas. I feel so different now, as if time and space no longer affect me anymore, as if I've been reborn into a new body, as a new being. I am no longer....me anymore.

Goodbye, whoever reads this...I'm no longer human. Just a servant for a being unknown to man...this is my new life. Pain and Torment...with no will to live, being an abomination...being...a monster.
