For as long as I can remember, the black figure has been there. It just stands and watches, doing absolutely nothing. 

Wherever I go, it’s somewhere in the corner. From room to room, it’s always there. The figure is slender, about 2.5 meters tall, completely black with white eyes that stare at me. I can’t explain it, but every time I move, its gaze follows me—even though not a single part of its body ever moves. It just stands, completely still, like a living statue. The figure would only disappear if I got close enough to touch it.

 Smaller objects would pass through it, but larger ones (like a couch or a chair) would make it vanish and reappear somewhere else, often within seconds.
No one else sees it.

I remember when I was five, I tried explaining it to my parents. They probably thought I had an imaginary friend like many kids do. Around the age of 12, my parents sent me to a child psychiatrist (for other reasons, but the figure didn’t help). That’s when I realized no one would ever believe me, so I stopped talking about it altogether. It became my secret, my shadow, my uninvited lifelong companion.

Since then, I just lived with it. It existed, I existed, and we didn’t bother each other much. At least, that’s how I saw it. Sometimes it annoyed me—blocking my view of the TV or the blackboard in school—but most of the time it didn’t get in the way. Light passed through it, which was weird sometimes, like when I’d wake up and see it glowing, only to realize the sun was behind it. It never made a sound. Not a breath, not a whisper. Just silence.

Two months ago, I started dating a girl. Things were great, better than I’d expected. But I noticed she often looked at it—or at least at the spot where it stood. I didn’t know if she could see it. A few times, after looking in its direction, she had panic attacks. I never asked her directly, though I probably should have. We broke up a week ago because we realized we just weren’t right for each other, or maybe that was just the easiest excuse.

That’s when it disappeared. On the bus ride home from the place where we broke up, I realized it was gone. It wasn’t waiting for me at home, not in any room. I went to sleep feeling strangely unsafe, but I managed to fall asleep anyway. The next morning, still gone. I wanted to talk to someone about it, but there was no one I could talk to without sounding insane. Even now, I hesitate to write this.

Three days ago, my ex got hit by a car. She’s been in a coma since. It happened right in front of the store where I work—I saw everything on the security cameras. It looked like she was running from someone. In a panic, she kept looking at the spot where IT used to stand after my shift. Right where it always waited for me.

Did I pass the figure’s curse onto her? I don’t even know if I should call it a curse—it never did anything, just watched. But now I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if she’ll survive. And if she does… I’ll have to talk to her. Even if it means finally learning the truth about what the figure really was.
