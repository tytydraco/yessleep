I was always a pretty shy guy. Probably because of this, I had trouble making any friends. It had been the same throughout my life. College was no exception. During the first semester of college, I did talk to some people here and there, but they never really became my friends.

Before I knew it, the first semester of my college had ended. When I came back to college after the semester break, it was like I was stepping into a whole new place. Strangely enough, I was put in classes where I only saw a few of my old classmates from the previous semester. All the others were people who I didn't know before. Most didn't talk to me and seemed to mind their business.

But there was this one group that usually sat separated from all the other students in the lecture hall. They usually sat in the corner of the back row. They also didn't talk to me at first. But one day, before the start of the lecture, one of them called me. Probably because I sat pretty close to them. They invited me to come and sit next to them, so I did. I found it strange that they had actually interacted with me, of all people. They didn't interact with anyone else in the class.

They were a group of three. Let's call them Brandon, Michael and John. John asked me a few personal questions and I answered them. Ofcourse, being the loner I was, I welcomed his questions. Ever since that day, I would always sit next to them and chat with them. They would ask me to show them my notebook that I always brought to college to write important points from the lectures.

I did notice that they never really brought anything when they came to college. Not even a notebook to take notes. I found it a bit strange since everyone else would bring those things with them when they attended the lecture classes. When I asked them one day, they told me that they don't need notebooks because the lectures were easy to understand for them.

I didn't really bother with what my other classmates thought of me. Looking back now, they obviously thought I was crazy or something. Because I did notice them giving me weird stares whenever I talked to Brandon, Michael or John. It made me really uncomfortable. I opened up about it to Brandon one day and he told me to not mind it. So I carried on as I usually did, not minding the stares I got from my other classmates.

And then started the nightmares. I kept having the same nightmare over and over again. In the nightmare, I'd stay pretty far away from Brandon, Michael and John in the lecture hall. I would eventually look back and see them with unnaturally wide grins that went ear to ear, with empty eye sockets. The minute I see them, I would wake up from the nightmare.

This was probably when I started to notice strange things about the three of them. Whenever they laughed, it almost seemed like they were forcing themselves to laugh. I don't know how to explain it really. Their laughs were not... natural. At least to me.

And on top of that, they always refused to let me have their numbers. And I have never seen them with phones or anything of that sort.

It was nearing the end of the semester. I was sitting next to Brandon, Michael and John as usual. The lecture class was about to start, and the professor hadn't arrived yet. I took my phone out of my pocket to check the class schedule for the day. I unlocked my phone and tried access the gallery, where I had the schedule saved. But for whatever reason, it wouldn't respond to my touch. I tapped over 10 times and it didn't work. I started tapping everywhere on the screen and accidentally opened the camera app. The default camera was set to the selfie camera, which showed me. But even though Brandon, Michael and John were sitting right next to me, it didn't show them at all. Just all empty seats. My blood ran cold.

They seemed to notice my fear and grinned at me with the same creepy grin they had in my nightmares. I bolted out of the lecture hall and went outside of college. When I glanced back at the college, they were there at the gate, with their unusually wide grins. I ran as fast I could as far as my legs would carry me. 

This was when everything started making sense to me. The stares from my classmates finally made sense to me. I wondered why no one had intervened at all. Because to them, I was like some crazy guy talking to himself and laughing by himself. I stopped going to that college after that. I just couldn't go to that creepy place again.

As soon as I stopped going to the college, the nightmares stopped completely. Things went back to normal and I completed my degree at another college. I always wonder what would have happened to me if I had kept attending that college.
