I have always been the adventuring type. Loved hiking and cave exploration ever since I was old enough to do so, and I've done some pretty difficult and physically challenging things. I always thought that exploration was the best way to find the world's secrets, and that every nook and cranny could have something important.  
But today, I learned why some places shouldn't be explored.

I was planning out my next cave trip, looking around on Google Maps, when I noticed a strange cave in northern Russia that caught my interest.

It had almost no detail about it on Google Maps, besides the fact it's interior was very large, its entrance was in Mount Pobeda, and presumably it was deep. It piqued my interest, so I booked a flight to the nearest city to Mount Pobeda, and planned to go there ASAP.

Once I got there, I went through the park around the mountain, searching for the cave. I found it hidden on the opposite side of the park, its tiny entrance placed as if it didn't want to be found. That's when I began to delve into it. I had packed about 2 weeks worth of food and water, winter clothes, and an extremely long rope that I would use to find my way back to the entrance.

The cave was wonderous, enormous stalactites and stalagmites hung from the ceiling, and many formed large pillars. Ice had covered a lot of the entrance, but there was almost none going deeper in. I looked in awe at the sheer scale, until I noticed something.

A footstep not of my own.

It was faint, and barely noticeable, but in the echoing caverns, I heard it.

But, I decided to press on, despite knowing I may be followed by someone. As I went deeper and deeper, I noticed strange blue stone, which looked nothing like I had ever seen before. I decided to stop for a second. That's when I heard another desynced footstep. The thing was still following me. I decided to press further, despite the interesting stone.

As i walked deeper and deeper, winding the rope further and further, I came across something that made my heart skip a beat.

Greenery.

This was something i didn't think could be possible all the way down here. How? This part of the cave is at least 1000 feet underground! There's no sunlight, and the stone has no nutrients!

But still, I decided to keep going, occasionally eating a bit of something while walking. As I kept going further, more and more greenery kept showing up, until I reached an opening into a large cavern.

I walked into it, and suddenly my face was flooded with light. It was an enormous garden.

This... shouldn't be possible. But it was there, right in front of me. Massive trees towering towards the ceiling, which somehow shown with a brilliant light. A large pit of water sat in the middle, and a long corridor, with no lights, was in front of me. I walked forward, admiring the beauty of the garden, the intricacy of the carved stone walls, but I knew I had to keep going, so the... *thing* wouldn't catch up. Walking down the halls, i decided to make a makeshift torch so I could see. Strangely, as I went forward, there were crossroads that I had to take.

I went left multiple times, the intricate stone disappearing slowly into... blackness. It was as if I was standing on darkness itself. As I walked forward, a massive pair of gilded gates appeared before me, cracked open. My curiosity overriding any sense of self-preservation, I walked towards the door, and peaked into it, torch shining brightly.

I could barely comprehend what I actually saw before my head exploded. Well, at least that was what it felt like. An incomprehensible amount of information flooded my head, knowledge of things that had died millions of years ago, the names and lives of every soul to ever live, the creation and destruction of a star, and so, so much more. I dropped my torch at... whatever that thing was's feet and just ran. I couldn't comprehend anything in front of me anymore, and my head swarmed with too much information.

I ran, and ran, until I saw the true sun, not whatever that ceiling was. I was not ever going to go there again.

My head still overflowing with information, I realized I could not let anyone suffer what I had just gone through.  
So, before I left that godforsaken place, I boarded up the small entrance of the cave, and wrote a warning.

"Whatever you do, do not enter this cave. There is something here that should never be seen."

I barely made it back to my hotel in one piece. Fortunately, my brain was starting to clear some of the many, many things that had been forced into my head.
