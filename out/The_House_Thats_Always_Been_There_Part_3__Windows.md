I am sorry for not posting in a while. I’ve been busy with work… and investigating a bit about the house. This will be a shorter post as what I’ve found seriously calls for further investigation.

I’ve said countless times in my two [previous posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o9d0mz/the_house_thats_always_been_there_part_2_the/) that I basically grew up next to Springhouse, a large house that's been in my family [for forever](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o657a3/my_family_calls_it_springhouse_i_call_it_the/).  
But it wasn’t until someone messaged me asking if I had any pictures I could share that I realized something… strange.

I never really noticed before how odd it is that a house like Springhouse, a place that’s been in my family for generations, has so few pictures taken of it.

After my mom passed away last year, I helped my dad clean up the house. We found some old photo albums my mom had stashed away at the back of the closet, albums I’d last seen when I was barely a teen, albums my father had completely forgotten existed.

We looked through them together, laughed at pictures of little me falling on the school playground, smiled at my parents’ newlywed photos… and cried at the photographs of my younger mother.

After a while, we put the albums back where they’d stayed for so long.

At the time, we were just trying to find things we wouldn’t need anymore, not memories.

They didn’t bother anyone from inside the closet, so back they went… and back to being forgotten too.

It wasn’t until I got that message asking for pictures that I remembered them, and since I can’t visit the house right now, I thought: *“Hell, I might as well look through those albums.”*

What was there to lose, right?

Well… apparently, a lot. Other than the time I lost looking through so many pictures… What I actually found has me clawing at the possibility that I might be losing my sanity.

There were plenty of pictures, but not many of the house itself.

I found albums tracing back to my grandparents’ generation, people I assume were my great-grandparents, relatives so far removed I’d never even thought to ask about them.

But among oceans of newer photos of my parents at the beach, older ones of people I barely recognized by the names scribbled along the borders, of bonfires and picnics in the forest… I began to notice small, familiar things.

A piece of wallpaper I remembered here…

A part of a door there…

And then, I saw *it*.

The first thing that caught my attention were the white streaks across the left side of the image. Mind you, that’s not glare from my lamp, it’s there on the original picture.

Maybe a light leak from when it was developed, or damage from sitting in a damp album for decades.

I don’t know.

What I do know is that it made me look closer. That’s when the second thing hit me like a brick to the head.

In the picture, only five windows can be seen on the second floor.

Even if one more was just out of frame on the right, that would make *six*.

Then… why is it that I so clearly remember there being fourteen?

Seven in the first floor, seven in the second.

Three at each side of the porch facing the lake.

Why is there a space between the two windows on the left that makes me feel like one is missing?

And then there's the reason to me beginning to lose my sanity... why, oh, dear God, why...

Maybe it’s true what she once said.

That we all go back to Springhouse… eventually.
