For context, I live in a medium to large city, and the route I have to take everyday from work to home is pretty long and depressing, surrounded by gray, old buildings and busy dirty streets. I have never liked this town: it's way too dark for me. However, there's this school that I walk past all the time. I mean, I think it's a school.

It's a large, grey building among large, grey buildings, and yet something is different about it. It's got this garden around it with statues, and if you look past them, at the windows, there's these kids who smile at you all the time. They must like looking out the window, or maybe I just happen to have my routine during their lunch break, because they're always there. I love watching them - they seem so happy.

I wish I was a child again.

My job is so damn boring. I work in an office all day, then go home to my roommate Emilia, have a drink, watch TV and sleep.

I wish I lived in that school.

At least, that's how I used to think. Now I'm not so sure.

See, a few weeks ago I had to switch shifts with a coworker, and finished pretty late, at 10PM.

Of course, I had to walk home by myself.

Now, as a woman, I was a bit afraid, so I had to make it quick. However, I was not expecting the children to still be there, smiling, when I walked past the school. I stopped to stare. What kind of school was this? They were supposed to be home by now. And why would they even sit so still?

The lights inside were on. I figured, what harm could it be if I stopped by and checked in on them?

If you haven't noticed by now, I am pretty curious and nosy. I mean, I'm an editor at this magazine, so it's part of the job, I guess. At least, that is what I tell myself.

I opened the gate and stepped inside. The garden was dark, and still a warm light shone through the bushes and roses, caressing the statues. I didn't have enough time to study them, as I noticed a shadow in the corner of my eye.

I turned, and there was nothing. So I kept walking.

As I got closer, suddenly someone spoke.

'Ma'am?'

I turned to see a person staring at me.

Now, I'm terribly sorry, but I could not seem to figure out whether it was a woman or a man. They had a smooth, almost feminine face, defined jaw, tall, broad shoulders, but the eyes were harsh and understanding at the same time. The voice didn't sound like anything. I felt oddly drawn to them, but something inside me was telling me to run. Oh, an they were *really* ugly. They looked almost deformed, and I imagined some sort of accident must have taken place to get them to look like this.

'What brings you here?'

'I, um, I'm a journalist. Just a study I'm conducting. Don't worry, it's not harmful.'

The person raised their brows. 'A study? About what?'

'Local schools.'

I felt as if I was being interrogated by a teacher. Something inside me was longing for their approval. I *wanted* them to like me.

Suddenly, a smile illuminated their face. 'I see. Right now, we aren't expecting any journalists, but you can come back tomorrow at noon. The kids are resting.'

'Sorry, I don't mean to intrude, but how are they resting? I always see them at the windows.'

The person didn't say anything, but turned to look at the building.

'Sir? Um, ma'am...?'

'They're happy. Don't you worry, miss. It's a school with an extended program. I take care of them personally.'

Those words made me shiver. I said, whatever, I'm gonna go home and, if I am to visit again, I'll do it in broad daylight.

I thanked the person and left. As I made my way to my quartier, I swear I could feel their eyes staring at me. Following me.

I unlocked my door and almost screamed. Emilia was standing right in front of me.

'God, you scared me. What are you even doing? Were you making out with the door?'

She shushed me and pulled me inside, then locked the door and told me to shut up.

'I was looking through the peephole. There was someone peeking from the corner of the hallway at you. I saw them out the window, following you here.'

'No fucking way.'

I suddenly felt very sick.

'Was it a man or woman?'

'I seriously couldn't tell.'

After I had told her about the school, she stood in silence next to her cup of coffee, then spoke calmly, but I could feel her scared.

'You shouldn't have taken that route. That street is sooo shady.'

'But it's a school?'

'Who told you that?'

'What else could it be? There's kids in there.'

'Orphanage? Hospital?'

After dinner, we didn't speak much of it. The next day, I went to the police. They told me they had no records of a school there.

'Couldn't you, at least, check out the place? There's kids in there.'

I gave them the address and waited. Meantime, I changed my route so as not to have to pass that again.

I got a call last Tuesday.

The police had 'inspected' the surroundings of said school. It was an abandoned building, and there was no sign of the kids.

So, in other words, since I had already gotten myself into this, and just like poor Icarus who flew too close to the sun, I had to take the matter into my own hands. I called an old friend and asked them to come with me, on Saturday, to investigate.

If something shady is going on, I will find out.
