I’d spent just shy of a week, cooped up in that dingy cabin, waiting for George to make his move. I spent countless nights strangled by fear and paranoia to the point that I had almost forgotten what was real anymore. It’s possible that, out of some twisted turn of fate, or perhaps because he wanted to play with my head, he let me live and allowed me to run for so long. At least that’s what I believe. Last night, he finally showed up. He must have been studying me because he knew everything. Every trap I had laid, every failsafe I had installed, he knew where everything was. I should’ve been smarter about it, but then again, I asked for this.

It all started with the lights. I don’t have a great relationship with them anymore after the incident in cooler number seven, so I normally wouldn’t keep too many on if I could help it. It was a dark, moonless night, so I needed more of them on than usual. I had just started dinner when they started to flicker. Being so deep in the woods, this would’ve been a normal occurrence if they had not done it twice in rapid succession before going out completely. Alarm bells went off in my head immediately.

“He’s here,” I said under my breath as I ran to the window in the corner of the cabin, crouching beneath it.

A bolt of fear ran through my chest as the room plunged into darkness. My senses heightened, flooding my veins with adrenaline. I knew that I would have to be sharp if I had any chance against him. I didn’t want to waste my opportunity.

The only sound filling the void was the slow, rhythmic tick of an old, antique wall clock. Its steady ticking seemed to ratchet the tension even higher. I stood motionless, adrenaline pumping, waiting for him to make a move. I knew it was him. I could feel it. I rested my hand on the shotgun mounted under the windowsill and pushed my ear to the wall, listening for movement outside. My heart was beating so fast that it thudded in my ears, muffling any sound that I thought I heard.

Suddenly, I heard a shuffling sound just outside the wall, like boots over gravel. It was time. I wasn’t going to let him get away. I pulled the shotgun out of the mount and racked a shell into the chamber. I was ready and willing to either kill him or die trying.

I listened closer, trying to pinpoint his position, when the shuffling stopped altogether. A quiet calmness settled over the room, filling me with anticipation. I didn’t like the silence. It set me on edge because I didn’t know what he was doing out there. I pulled my ear away from the wall and began to raise my head to peer out of the window. My eyes were inches away from cresting the windowsill when I heard the sound of something heavy slamming onto the wood on the back porch. I froze as the sound of heavy footsteps trudged up the stairs.

“Fucking idiot,” I huffed, shaming myself for being so careless.

I should’ve known he wouldn’t try to come through the front door. He’s too smart for that. Suddenly, three soft knocks echoed from behind the back door. I didn’t budge. I stood up, resting the butt of the shotgun on my hip, and turned the muzzle toward the back door. I pushed my back against the wall next to the window and set my position. If he wanted me, he was going to have to come inside and get me. I hadn’t felt fear up to this point, but I felt an ever-so-small amount of it slither up my spine. My heart boomed in my ears as I stared at the door handle, waiting for what followed. I was prepared to kill him when he came through the door. What I was not prepared for was what actually came next. What followed the knocks scared me more than the anticipation of him actually busting through the door.

A low, wet dragging sound filled the room. It sounded like something was being pulled across the porch boards. The fabric sounded like sandpaper scraping against the wood, coming to a stop right at the base of the door.

Something heavily slammed down on the porch with a wet, squelching slap, startling me. I stepped back, pushing harder against the wall. I raised the shotgun to my shoulder and leveled it at the door, waiting for him to break it open. I steadied my heartbeat by focusing on the small brass bead, which was now squarely centered in the middle of the door.

I heard what sounded like fabric being ripped, followed by another heavy thud. This one was closer to the door, possibly on it. It slammed into the wood, causing the doorframe to creak and moan from the stress. This one sounded more metallic, like metal on metal. I tightened my grip on the gun as I braced for the worst. My nerves had reached a fever pitch. I slid my finger across the trigger and pressed my cheek firmly into the stock.

Just when I thought he was about to rush in, the pounding suddenly stopped. A weird, uncomfortable silence fell over the room. All I could hear was the eerily faint chirping of crickets outside, as if they were holding back in suspense, waiting for something to break the silence.

The footsteps proceeded to move away from the door, slow and cautious. The boards squeaked loudly, complaining from the weight of each heavy step. My heart pounded like it was trying to burst free from my chest. I slowly took a step forward, trying to follow the sound with my ears. I listened closely as the footsteps descended the steps and faded into the night, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

The lights flickered again, finally returning to bathe the cabin’s interior in their glow. As my eyes re-focused and adjusted to the light, I spotted a small, yellow scrap of paper lying on the floor just past the door threshold. It had been shoved in over the top of the sill and through the crack at some point. I never saw it come through. I was so focused on the shotgun's front sight bead that I didn’t notice anything else.

I crept forward and picked it up. Just a single word, scrawled in dried blood, was written on it.

‘Enjoy’

As I studied the note, I became aware of a putrid smell that was emanating from just outside the door. It smelt like rotten meat, oddly sweet and metallic. I stepped to the door, wrapping my hand around the knob. In my other hand, I held the shotgun, bracing it against my hip and keeping it pointed straight ahead just in case. I took a moment, trying to drum up the courage to explore the source of the smell. I gritted my teeth and swung the door open, ready to fire. I was met with an empty porch. There was nobody there.

I know how it sounds, but I had prepared myself to pull the trigger as soon as I saw the person on the other side without hesitation. I was mentally prepared to spend the rest of my life in prison if it turned out not to be him. I had gotten that desperate.

I scanned the area around the porch and just off the base of the stairs. There was no sign of anyone. I pulled my attention back to the porch, finally letting the shotgun lower down to my side. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, allowing my heart to slow down a bit.

I opened my eyes and looked back at the stairs. A fresh trail of blood led up to the base of them and ascended right up to the door, pooling around the porch mat. It slowly ran over the floorboards, dripping down into the crawlspace below. I followed the trail with my eyes toward the door. The stream of blood led behind the door and then seemed to travel up the back of it. I took a step forward, peering around it, where I was startled to see something hanging on it. Blood poured from the object, pooling onto the porch below.

I jumped back just as the smell hit me. The horrific stench of death crawled into my nose, sending me backward and away from it. I pulled my shirt over my nose and slowly pulled the door back to me so I could see what this thing was. I pulled it back enough to see the outer side, revealing why the earlier thuds had been so loud and metallic. A long strip of raw meat had been nailed to the door, soaking it with blood. I noticed that something was tied to it, dangling below. It was covered in blood, but it didn’t take me long to figure out what it was.

To my horror, dangling at the end of the rope was John’s rotten, decaying hand. His class ring was now snugly back on his finger.

“What the fuck!?” I exclaimed.

There was no way this could be true. I had put that ring in the drawer of my bedside table when I got to the place. I hadn’t moved it, and yet it was now back on its owner's finger.

I staggered back inside, pulling the door closed behind me. I bolted every lock, which became a much harder chore due to how badly my hands were shaking. I stumbled backward into the kitchen, not letting the back door out of my sight. No matter how I felt about it previously, I needed to be bathed in as much light as I could find.

I continued to stumble backward away from the door. The kitchen countertop pushing into my lower back was my sign to stop. I put my hand down on it to hold myself up. The adrenaline was subsiding, letting fear and doubt creep their way back in. My body was shaking so much that I couldn’t hold onto the shotgun anymore. I laid it down on the kitchen counter and splashed my face with cold water from the sink. I reached into the drawer below, pulling out the matches to light the stove. I had to try to get back into some semblance of a routine, or I would’ve actually lost my sanity. In addition, I was starving. With everything that had happened in the last hour, it felt like I had burned ten thousand calories from the stress alone.

I turned around to grab a pot, trying to stay focused on the task at hand. As I stood back up, I turned, clanging the pot onto the stove eye. Staring into the empty pot, my brain forced me to do a double-take. I swore I had seen something out of the corner of my eye when I turned with the pot. My eyes had involuntarily flicked over to the entrance of the hall leading to my bedroom as I turned, catching a dark shape moving in the hallway. I whipped my head in that direction, squinting into the darkness. A silhouette crossed my vision, moving out of my bedroom and toward the living room. It stopped in the middle of the entranceway, allowing me to get a better look. That’s when I saw him. George was inside the cabin. His reflection stared back at me from the living room mirror just outside the kitchen door. I grabbed the shotgun from the table and spun it toward him. I focused my vision on where I had seen him, but there was nothing there. He had vanished… again.

Panic swallowed me whole. I tore through the house with the shotgun raised, checking every door, lock, and trap. Nothing had been triggered, and there were no signs of entry anywhere.

“Was he even here at all?” I asked myself, thinking that the lack of sleep had caused hallucinations that must have created a vision of him.

No. I knew he was in there with me. There was no other explanation. I’m not crazy.

I hardly slept after that. I sat in the corner with the gun on my lap, staring at the back door for hours. Every creak and groan the cabin made sent a jolt through my body. Though the stinging burn of exhaustion clawed at them, my eyes remained locked on the back door. He had me in a chokehold of fear. Every time the floor creaked or a wind gust pressed against the windows, my brain spiraled into panic. I could feel his presence hanging in the air like a dense fog, thick and oppressive, suffocating me with every breath I took.

The hours dragged on. Shadows shifted across the walls, stretching and contorting as if they were alive. My whole body ached. I had clenched my muscles for so long that they began to cramp and seize. My nerves were frayed from the endless psychological torment the darkness brought with it. I could hear my blood pumping through my ears, a steady drumbeat filled with fear and expectation.

The hours continued to roll by, one after another. The shotgun felt like an anchor sitting on my lap, becoming heavier and heavier, mirroring my weakening resolve.

I stayed vigilant through the night, keeping my eyes glued to the door for as long as I could. Just after 3:30 this morning, my body began to betray me. My eyelids became heavy and defiant, finally drooping across my vision and obscuring the door. I tried to fight it, but I was so exhausted that I couldn’t take it anymore. My eyelids closed, defying my command. Darkness enveloped me, wrapping its sticky fingers around my consciousness and pulling it under the surface.

Sleep had finally come, but it didn’t bring rest. Instead, it brought visions of terrifying clarity. Memories I had tried to forget twisted into nightmares. My deepest fears were given flesh. An amalgamation of horror rose before me, shifting and contorting like an obelisk made of pure fear. The structure opened, revealing a road made of white bricks leading into a never-ending abyss of black. The next thing I knew, I was walking down the path, unable to stop myself. I walked for what seemed like miles before I finally came to the end. The road came to an end, dropping into a pit of nothingness underneath it. My body continued to push me forward, involuntarily walking me up to the edge. I yelled and screamed to stop, but it didn’t listen. I closed my eyes as the last step was taken, sending me tumbling off the road and into an endless fall.

When I opened them, I found myself back in the cooler. The air was thick with the smell of death and rot. George stood at the entrance. His head was cocked to the side like a predator observing its wounded prey struggle. His eyes gleamed, like orange, glowing pinpricks of malevolence in the dark. He smiled as he began walking toward me. I tried to move. To scream. To do anything, but nothing came. My body was still paralyzed. All I could do was watch him come closer, step by agonizing step, as the walls closed in and the cooler door slowly creaked closed, plunging me into deep, absolute darkness. As the blackness spilled through the room, George’s eyes grabbed my attention, becoming the only thing left that was still visible, continuing to inch closer and closer.

I awoke with a jolt. My phone had woken me up and was buzzing in my pocket. I was out of breath and sweating profusely from enduring whatever the hell I had just been through. The fog encircling my brain finally cleared enough that I remembered the door. My eyes widened at the realization, as I threw the shotgun up to my shoulder, aiming at the center of it. There was nobody there. Everything was locked and as it should’ve been. I slowly dropped the gun back to my lap, now trembling with fear. I rested my head against the wall, trying to calm myself down and slow my heart rate. Once the adrenaline had subsided, the buzzing in my pocket became more noticeable. I scrambled to pull it out, fumbling with it before holding it up to my face. I squinted my eyes to see the number through the fog of sleep.

‘Unknown Caller’

I silenced it and let it ring, hoping that it was nothing more than just a telemarketer. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath, trying to shake the visions out of my head. I felt my phone stop buzzing, which caught my attention. I looked down at it once more, hoping for validation that it was a spam call. My heart sank when the voicemail notification popped up. Those calls never leave voicemails, and even if they do, they’re only a couple of seconds at most. This one was two minutes long. My hands began to tremble as I pressed the play icon. Through the speaker, I could hear a voice. My voice. It was a recording of me, calling out weakly in the cooler weeks ago.

“Aunt Carla… It’s Tom. I need help…”

The entire phone call played over the voicemail, sending me right back to cooler number seven. All of the fear, trauma, and emotion that I felt in that place returned in an instant. I listened as my words weakly trailed off into silence, followed by a loud click. It sounded like someone pressing a button on an old cassette player once it had finished playing. I heard George’s voice pick up shortly after, calm and deliberate as always.

“I told you, Tom. We finish what we start.”

I threw the phone on the ground at my feet and kicked it across the room. It bounced across the uneven floorboards, coming to rest within a foot of the back door. I sat, staring at it in a daze, not knowing what to think. My eyes burned, screaming for relief, but I couldn’t look away. I just couldn’t.

Eventually, dawn broke. Sunlight pierced through the thinly veiled windows, covering the cabin’s interior with warm, orange light. I had spent the entire night sitting on the kitchen floor, clutching a 12-gauge, too afraid to sleep. The sun’s warm embrace was a welcome change. Once the cabin was filled with light completely, I was able to stand up. My legs were weak from sitting in the same position for so long. My muscles ached from the strain, screaming at me in pain. It felt like I had been in a car crash. I racked the shell out of the shotgun and slid it back into the magazine for safety. I wasn’t in the best mindset at that moment, and if the mailman had knocked on the door, he may have gotten a face full of buckshot.

I composed myself and began formulating a plan for the day. There was no way I was going to just sit around in the cabin and wait for him to come back. I needed to get out. I needed to move again.

I loaded up my car with everything I could carry and drove. I didn’t have a plan or a direction, just an ambition to leave as fast as possible. I just needed to get away from that place. The further I got, the closer the shadows seemed to follow behind me, lingering in my mind like a cancer eating away at what little sanity I had left. Every rearview glance produced a spike of anxiety that no amount of radio music could quell. I expected to see his face in the mirror every time I looked back, sitting in the back seat, ready to strangle me to death. Eventually, I found myself back in Redhill. I don’t remember turning the wheel or how I even had enough gas to make it, but I was back. I don’t know how much stock I put into believing in fate, but it needed me to come back here. It demanded it.

The butcher shop stood there like usual, silent and empty. Physically, it hadn’t changed, but something was telling me that this time was different. I pulled up and parked across the street from it. I sat, staring at the front door as visions of the torment this place inflicted on me flashed through my head. I grabbed the shotgun from the backseat and racked a shell in before proceeding to walk to the front door. I stopped just as I stepped onto the sidewalk, taking a second to gather myself. I tightened my grip on the gun and pushed myself to continue toward the door.

“If this is it,” I said, as I grabbed the door handle, “then I will take that son of a bitch with me.”

To my surprise, the door was stuck. It felt like something was blocking it from the inside. I forced it open, pushing several heavy boxes out of the way, and stepped in. I proceeded cautiously, observing the interior with the shotgun raised. The inside of the shop was in pristine condition. The floors had been polished. The knives were all arranged by size and type. The place was put together with surgical precision and detail. I laid my hand down on the counter, reliving old memories. Not all of this place was evil… just the man who ran it. The air had a strong scent of bleach, sanitized and cold. It wasn’t very often that the place was ever this clean. I imagine because of everything that had happened and with the police snooping around, George had to slow down and clean up his act.

I slowly made my way behind the counter, pushing the plastic curtains aside with the barrel of the shotgun. I warily passed through, examining the hallway as I went. There wasn’t anything really remarkable about the hallway, just that it was immaculately clean. The place I knew had never been this clean… ever.

I passed each cooler, pulling each of them open just a crack to peek inside. Cooler numbers one and two each contained several pig carcasses, along with some already packaged meat. Coolers three through five all had large cuts of beef on hooks. Large rib racks, brisket, and untrimmed loins hung from them, all beautifully cut with precision. From what I remembered, the floors inside the coolers were covered in blood and half-empty boxes, but here and now, they were spotless.

I proceeded to the end of the hallway, gun still raised and ready. Once again, I pushed the plastic curtains aside with the gun barrel, this time with my finger firmly pressed against the trigger. This was it. This was where it all happened. If he were here, this is where he would be. As I passed through the curtains, I could see that the door to cooler number seven was open with a faint light flickering inside. I passed by cooler six and slowly crept toward the opening to seven. My body forced me to stop, once again sending flashes across my mind filled with the horrific things I had seen and endured inside this place. I closed my eyes, trying desperately to push them away. I took a deep breath, shook my head, and stepped in.

The moment my boots hit the tile, everything came flooding back. The smells, the cold, the lights, they were all the same. Preoccupied with nostalgia, I didn’t maintain eye contact with the door. That was my biggest mistake, as it slammed hard behind me, reverberating across the cooler walls. I spun around and grabbed the handle, trying to open it, but it wouldn’t budge. My fingers cramped as I tried desperately to grasp the handle. I couldn’t get a grip. My hand kept sliding off of it, leaving only faint scratches from where my fingernails hit the metal. It was jammed tightly closed, as if it had been welded shut. I was trapped, just like before.

Rage built inside of me, coming to a head. I could feel myself losing control. He had done it again. He had manipulated me right into his hands without having to do much at all. I had walked right back into the place I had sworn I would never enter again. I slammed my fist into the door several times, letting the anger flow out of me. Blood smeared the pristine, white surface from where my knuckles had impacted it. The sharp sting grounded me, reminding me that I couldn't afford to lose control of my senses. Not now.

I closed my eyes and took a slow, shaky breath. The pain in my hand helped me to refocus my thoughts, subduing the immense rage I had been harboring. Anger was not going to help me survive here. I needed to think. Somehow, I needed to be smarter than him. I exhaled through gritted teeth, flexed my fingers, and turned around to examine my surroundings. I knew the place fairly well. I was confident I could find a way out.

The walls still bore faint bloodstains from decades of use, no matter how hard they had been scrubbed. The floor was still marked with my blood. I could see the circle where I had made that fateful phone call. I scanned the rest of the interior, feeling along the walls, when all of a sudden, a familiar, faint humming sound filled the air. I looked up to the lights, still producing that sickly yellow glow. The flickering fluorescent bulbs illuminated the cooler more than I remembered. The room was cleaner than I remembered, too. Yet, in my mind, no matter how clean or nostalgic the place was, nothing could erase the memories of what happened there.

The hooks above me swayed gently, even though the air was still. Something about it all felt staged, as if I were walking into a movie scene. Suddenly, I heard a deep resonant groan from within the cooler walls. A loud clanking sound was followed by the sound of two pieces of metal scraping against each other. The side of the cooler was opening. The thick insulation parted, revealing a seam in the wall where a hidden door opened into cooler six.

I raised the shotgun at the opening, heart racing, producing a frantic pounding in my head. I fought the primal urge to flee as the light steadily filled the doorway. Like smoke leaking into the room, the acrid scent of blood and bleach flowed out of the opening, wrapping around me. I tightened my grip on the shotgun, desperately trying to steady my shaking hands. A silhouette pressed its way through the darkness and into the opening, now standing in the middle of the doorway. An old leather boot shot out of cooler number six, slamming down onto the floor in front of me. I pushed my cheek into the gunstock, focusing on the front bead as the figure stepped through the threshold. It was him. George emerged from the odd cooler entrance, now standing just a few feet from the shotgun's muzzle.

His eyes gleamed with cold, calculating madness. I noticed him clutching a knife in his hand that looked strangely familiar. The light flickered across it, and I recognized it immediately. The crimson handle shone out against the white background of the cooler walls. The strange inscriptions and symbols seemed to glow orange as the light flowed across the blade.

“I knew you’d come back,” he said, voice low and rasping like steel dragging across a stone. “But, then again, you never really left, did you?”

My grip tightened, my finger twitching against the trigger.

“This ends now, George,” I said, voice shaking.

He took a slow step forward, holding the knife in front of him.

“It never ends, son.” He said, coldly. “No matter what happens right here and now, we will always be here. Like the blood on these walls, we will always remain… I will always remain.”

He took another step closer, coming to within inches of the barrel.

“You better fucking stop!” I exclaimed shakily. “I’ll fucking kill you!”

I was breathing heavily. The stress and intensity of the situation got to me. I had told myself hundreds of times that I wouldn’t hesitate when I had this chance, and yet I couldn’t pull the trigger.

“You gonna shoot me, son?” he asked, holding his arms out wide as he slowly inched closer.

I gritted my teeth as I tried with all my might to pull the trigger. My finger spasmed, locked in position, just barely putting pressure against it.

He took one more step, looking down at the barrel as he pushed himself into it, pressing it to the center of his chest. He looked up at me, curling a smile across his face.

“Didn’t think so.” He said, staring into my eyes.

Suddenly, with one swift motion, he grabbed the barrel and pushed it to the side. I reacted as fast as I could, pulling the trigger. The shotgun erupted with a thunderous blast. The cramped space transformed into a suffocating chamber filled with deafening noise and blazing heat. For a split second, everything went blank. My ears rang loudly, as if a swarm of angry bees had taken residence inside my skull.

My senses clawed back slowly, the ringing fading into a dull throb, allowing the buzzing of the lights to take over once more. My vision cleared, and the weight of the shotgun settled back into my hands.

My mind had already created the picture of George lying on the cooler floor, decimated by the buckshot, but he was faster than that. He had ducked around it. Stunned by the gunshot, he stood shaking his head, trying to regain his senses. His strong, calloused hand maintained its grip around the shotgun barrel, controlling my movement with it. He turned his head to face me, anger filling his face. Without warning, he lunged at me, disregarding my weapon.

Everything seemed to slow down as if time were moving at half speed. The blast had thrown us both into a dizzying haze, but he was still coming at me. I dropped to the side just as he reached out to swipe at my throat. The blade missed its mark, skimming across my shoulder, slicing through fabric and skin alike, and cutting me from my collar bone to my bicep. Searing pain flared across my body, but luckily, I was able to hold onto the gun.

“WHY!?” I screamed, swinging the butt of the shotgun and connecting with the side of his head.

He staggered, falling into the cooler wall to brace himself. I wasn’t going to let this chance slip away from me again. I quickly turned, raising the shotgun and leveling it at the side of his head. My hands were rock steady. There were no more jitters. It was time to end it.

I aimed and pulled the trigger.

Click…

“Fuck!” I loudly exclaimed.

I forgot to rack in the next shell.

Panic overtook me as I fumbled with the pump. George turned toward me, wild hate filling his eyes, lunging at me again. This time, he connected, tackling me into the wall of hanging hooks. The shotgun was sent flying, eventually landing in the middle of the cooler floor a few feet away from us. He pressed me against the hooks harder. The metal dug into my back as we struggled, cutting me in several places. Blood ran down the front of my shirt, covering us both. His arms now slick with my blood, he pulled me away from the hooks and slammed me against the opposite wall, pressing his face up close to mine, his breath hot and foul on my face.

I struggled mightily, using the blood to slip from his grasp and push him back away from me. I thought I was gaining some ground until I felt the cold tip of the knife press against my ribs. I froze, slowly pulling my eyes up to meet him. I could feel the sharp tip puncture my skin as I breathed in, creating an oscillation of pain with every inhale and exhale. He smiled, inches from my face, like he was savoring it.

“Just like old times, huh, kid?” he whispered.

He may have cornered me, but I wasn’t a kid, nor was I the same person who had answered his ad. I had beaten him once, and I was determined to do it again.

I brought my knee up into his gut, hard. He reeled back, dropping the knife from my chest. He began coughing, holding his stomach with his hand. I used the opening to push my back against the cooler wall, preparing for him to rush me again. He recoiled quickly, still holding his stomach as he leaped toward me. He swung at me wildly with his knife, producing the opening I had been looking for. I waited for him to raise the knife before ducking down and underneath his outstretched arm. I went to the ground and rolled past him toward the center of the cooler. His momentum carried him past me, his knife connecting with the cooler wall. The blade sank halfway into the thick insulation and became stuck. I fell out of the roll, lying flat on my stomach. I looked back at George, who was desperately pulling at the knife, trying to yank it free from the cooler wall.

As I reached over to grab the shotgun, he saw me and started screaming as he tore across the cooler toward me. I quickly rolled over, pulling the gun across my chest. He tried to lunge down at me, but I had made it onto my back before he could get into position. As he fell downward, I quickly pushed the shotgun up to meet him, jamming the barrel under his chin.

Time once again seemed to stand still as I saw the hate in George's eyes dissipate, if only for a moment. He looked down at me, wrapping that mad smile across his face.

“You’re not gonna kill me,” He said, chuckling lightly. “You don’t have it in you.”

I stared into his eyes as I wrapped my finger around the trigger, steady and firm. This time, I racked in a new shell. The husk of the spent one fell to the floor, clinking across the tile before rattling to a stop. You could hear a pin drop in that brief moment. I saw George’s eyes widen even more, a semblance of fear sweeping across them.

“Goodbye, George,” I said calmly, the slightest bit of shakiness showing through.

His face twisted into a snarl as his anger began to burst through.

“No!” he screamed as he swung his fists toward me.

I closed my eyes and pushed my finger firmly against the cold trigger, releasing a full load of buckshot into the bottom of George's face.

I felt a warm, wet liquid explode across my face, startling me with its unexpected arrival. The impact felt like a sudden, localized downpour of rain on my skin. It clung uncomfortably to my face, slowly dripping down my cheeks and mouth.

 I quickly turned over, dropping the shotgun to the ground. It clattered against the floor, signifying the finality of the moment. The metallic taste of blood filled my nose and throat, causing me to gag and vomit as my body rejected the foul liquid. I wiped my face with my shirt, but it didn’t help much. It was covered in my own blood as well as his blood and bone fragments.

I finally wiped enough away to clear my vision, looking down at my feet toward George. His body had dropped instantly and was now lying limp on the cooler floor. Where his face used to be was now a black, smoking hole, pouring blood out of it and across the floor. I sat up quickly, pulling my legs away from his body. I already had enough of his blood on me; I didn’t need any more.

The room was spinning. My ears were ringing, causing a splitting headache to penetrate my skull. I sat for a moment, examining the alien scene, not fully believing it was real. Blood was splattered across the floor, painting over decades of old stains. The contents of George’s sick and twisted mind now lay in small fragments strewn across my face and torso. I fell back onto the floor, panting, trying to make sense of everything that had just happened. I was so exhausted. I wanted to continue lying there, but something in me told me to get up and keep moving. I pulled myself up to my feet and walked over to where I had tossed the gun. I reached down and grabbed it, squeezing tightly to counteract the slick layer of blood covering it.

I walked over and was finally able to pull George’s blade from the wall, using it to pry the side door open into cooler six. I jiggled the latch on the main entrance door to cooler six until it finally gave, opening into the hallway. I stumbled out into it, dragging the gun behind me.

Bloodied, but triumphant, I staggered out to my car with a wide smile on my face. I climbed in and sat holding the steering wheel for a minute or two. Everything finally hit me all at once. I rested my forehead on the top of the steering wheel and sobbed. The journey was not over, but the mission for revenge had been completed.

I drove as fast and as far as I could, never once looking back. I don’t remember how far I thought I would go or where I thought I was going to end up. All I remember is the deafening silence and the feeling of sticky blood drying on my skin.

That was just over seven hours ago.

I’m writing this from a motel in Bardswell. I ended up stopping by the emergency room once I got into town. After a fairly short wait, I ended up with thirty-six stitches in my shoulder, a tetanus shot, and an antibiotic from where he cut me. I’m surprised he didn’t kill me, honestly.

I’m exhausted. I’ve barely slept in the last few days. I can’t, honestly. Every time I close my eyes, I see him. I can hear his raspy voice and smell that stench of rot mixed with bleach.

Sometimes, as if summoned by the very memory still fresh in my brain, the stale air of the motel room seems to thicken, wrapping around me like a blanket of unrelenting fear and regret. The shadows in the corner deepen, becoming darker than the darkest night. Sometimes, I can almost feel the phantom chill of the cooler air, the weight of the shotgun still heavy in my hands. The putrid scent of death and decay fills the room, stinging my nose and eyes. The world outside this cheap room fades away, replaced by the visceral, echoing reality of what happened in that place. But now, I can feel something else beneath the trauma, something better. A flicker of something fragile, yet undeniable, is starting to grow. I finally feel hope.

It’s not much, but it’s enough to keep me going. I don’t know how long I can run from it, or how many more roads I can drive down before the nightmares swallow me whole, but for now, it’s enough. I don’t know what I’ll do next. I’ve already left my life behind. Aunt Carla won’t miss me. Hell, the times I saw her at the police station, she barely wanted to even look at me, let alone talk to me. I plan to send in the paperwork to change my name in the next few days, hopefully escaping this place altogether. I’m not sure if I’ll ever trust anyone again.

It's still just so raw and fresh on my mind. It’s hard to believe that just a few hours ago, I was in a fight for my life. I’ve had several flashes since then that take me right back in an instant. I can feel his hot breath on my face again, and the searing pain of the knife slicing my flesh. I can still feel the ache in my shoulder from the shotgun’s recoil. It’s all swirling around in my head, but I refuse to let it break me. Never again.

I’ve found that there’s a strange, haunting clarity that comes with surviving something like this. George isn’t gone just because he’s dead. He lives on in the darkest corners of my mind. You can’t kill a ghost. You can only accept it and move on, living with it as best you can. I’ll find a way to heal. Maybe, in time, I'll be able to forget the sight of bags filled with body parts and be able to drown out the sound of his laugh. More importantly, maybe I’ll be able to forget the smell of cooler number seven.

For now, that’s all I’ve got… the memories and the wounds. I’m stuck with it, cursed to carry it with me, hidden deep amongst the inner workings of my mind.

As I sit here on this spring-filled mattress, the motel room feels like a temporary refuge, like a pause button on a game I’m not sure I want to keep playing. But it’s where I am now. It’s where I have to be. I feel like if I try too hard to rationalize it, it might make me feel bad for him in some way, and he doesn’t deserve that. He deserves exactly what he received. He died in a cold, lonely place where so many of his victims spent their final moments. He will not have beautiful words written about him, remembering his spirit, nor will he be buried on a hill under some ornate headstone. No. He will rot in cooler number seven… a temple built upon his sins.

As I lay my head down on the pillow, I can breathe easier knowing that he is gone. But there’s a weight that follows it. A final breath of relief mixed with the cold emptiness of knowing how much it cost me to get here. I see my life in a way that I never have before. By causing me so much pain, he made me dig deeper, forcing me to prove to myself that I can do things I never thought possible. He taught me not to take life for granted, or else you end up on the chopping block.

For that, I am grateful.
