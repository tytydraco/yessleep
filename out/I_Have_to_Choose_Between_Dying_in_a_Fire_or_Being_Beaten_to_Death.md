Knock.

Knock.

Knock.

“What the hell?” I muttered to myself as I hurriedly finished putting on my slacks.

I wasn’t expecting anyone to be coming by today. Especially not at 6:30 in the morning while I was getting ready to head to work. While I wasn’t particularly fond of anyone swinging by without warning, curiosity got the best of me.

I cracked open the door and was met by one of the most beautiful women I had ever met in my life. Her hair was black and curly, flowing gently down to her shoulders. Her eyes were a chilly blue, but still had a warmth and kindness behind them. She wore bright red lipstick on her slightly upturned lips, a smirk dawning her face as she looked back at me. She was dressed sharply, with a modest dress buttoned up to her neck and flowing down past her knees. She held a folder in her hands, letting it rest against her legs as she stood. She was gorgeous. The very picture of beauty, standing right on my doorstep.

I immediately perked up, opening the door wider to get a better look at her. Even though I knew that she could be a marketer or some other scammer, I wanted to drink in the scene before she ruined my fantasy.

“Thomas Reinhart?” she asked, her voice both velvety and commanding in equal measures.

That got my attention.

I sighed, slumping a bit and gearing myself up for some sort of cheesy sales pitch. 

“Yeah, that’s me. What the hell do you want?” I asked, making my displeasure known as I leaned against the door frame.

Her smile grew a bit, stretching higher up the side of her face.

“May I come in?” she asked, her eyes never leaving mine.

I paused, looking her over once more. It was tempting, but I didn’t want to risk letting her trap me in with whatever crap she was promoting. I wanted to at least know what she wanted, before she made me late for work. Ideally, the fun way.

“Are you going to answer my question?” I ask again, trying to maintain my resolve and send her on her way.

She didn’t falter or move. She simply kept looking at me. Her eyes were seemingly burrowing a hole into my soul, trying to find some sort of opening she could exploit. If she was desperate, she didn’t show it. There wasn’t an ounce of nervousness or doubt to be seen. 

“May I come in?” she asked again, her voice becoming more sultry. 

I wasn’t able to hide a smile this time around as I took a minute to consider her. Sure, she could be some sort of murderer or just very good at her job, but I liked where this was going. Plus, she was around 5’5 and 130 pounds soaking wet, while I was over six feet tall and easily 250. If she was going to try anything, there was no way that she could hurt me. 

That’s what I thought, at least.

“Okay. Yeah, come on in. Just to warn you though, you may not be able to handle what I have to offer.” I grinned, stepping to the side to let her in.

She simply giggled, stepping past me and walking inside my house.

I shut the door as she walked in, turning to face her as it clicked shut. She was even more striking closer up. I could even smell her perfume as she strolled past, the light scent of hyacinths gracing my nostrils as she glided past. She stopped and stood in the middle of my living room, taking a look around as she stood in the center of the room.

“So, this is how a bigshot lawyer lives nowadays?” she cooed, turning back to look at me once more.

“You can say more than just four words then. I’m glad. Makes me feel better if I’m not getting into the pants of some disabled chick.” I chuckled, shrugging off the fact that she knew my profession and stepping towards her to place a hand on her waist.

Her smile does not falter. She doesn’t move in the slightest in fact, keeping her gaze on me.

“While I know that this form is something that appeals to you, this is strictly a business matter. I would apologize for leading you on, but I don’t feel bad for doing what I needed to.” She stated matter-of-factly, pulling my hand off her and tossing it away.

She finally pushed past me, striding her way to the kitchen table. 

“Then you can see yourself out before I throw you out.” I scoffed, all interest rapidly dissipating in a moment as I tailed her. 

I paused, staring at her as she appeared to take in the entire room around her. I could feel my blood start to boil as she then pulled out a chair and sat down, placing the folder down in front of her.

“Hey, didn’t you hear me you dumb bitch? I said leave. I don’t want you and your ‘this form’ bullshit in my house anymore. I’m not against throwing you out either.” I growled, towering over her as I quickly closed the distance.

She looked up at me again, not even allowing a crack in her facade. 

“I assure you Mr. Reinhart, this will be much easier if you cooperate. We have much to discuss.” she said, seemingly oblivious to the size difference as she grinned wider up at me.

I was speechless. How dare she sit in my house, refuse to leave, and act like everything was a-okay? How did this delusional chick think that this was going to go? That I would give up and let her do her stupid presentation or whatever it is that she wanted from me?

Well, that wasn’t going to happen on my watch.

“Nope. You’re out of here” I spat angrily, grabbing her by the shoulder to lead her out of my home.

Immediately, a searing pain spread through my arm. It felt like my arm was being attacked by rabid piranhas, ripping and tearing away my flesh as they climbed up my arm. I screamed, letting go and sinking to my knees. I watched as my sleeve slowly sloughed off my arm, revealing lines of black snaking up my arm like vines up a tree. They stopped short of my armpit, pulsating and throbbing and wriggling like worms around my bicep.

“Didn’t anyone tell you to not lay a malicious hand on a woman?” she asked, the smile melting off her face as the warmth in her voice faded into a cold, monotone drone. 

I watched in horror as her appearance slowly began to change. Her eyes lost their light, turning gray and milky. Her hair fell out in clumps, leaving her head patchy and bald in some spots. Her skin lost its glow, turning a sickly pale color with black rot creeping up her fingertips. The smell of flowers is overtaken by the smell of decay, filling the room with the nauseating scent of death.

I quickly got to my feet, breaking into a sprint as her cold, dead eyes watched my every move. I rushed through the living room, unlocking and throwing open the door to run. The door immediately slammed shut in front of me, with this woman now standing in front of me and blocking my path. I didn’t even see her move, as if she simply materialized in front of me. I turned around to attempt to get away, but was confronted by her once again, face to face. I screamed, scrambling backwards until my back pressed against the door. She kept up with me, making sure to keep the distance close until we were inches away.

I was utterly trapped.

She leaned in close, stopping inches away. The smell became overwhelming as her features became skeletal, her skin becoming taunt and thin. Her eyes dribbled out of their sockets and her teeth clattered onto the floor as they fell out of her mouth. Her voice came out as an airy hiss, her words floating around my head before piercing my ears. There was only one word on her non-existent lips.

“Sit.”

I reluctantly found my way back to the table and sat across from the woman, trying my best to avoid her empty sockets that were somehow burning a hole in my forehead as I looked at the table top. Whatever had a hold on my arm dispersed once I took a seat, with the pain tapering off quickly. However, long black streaks were now burned into my arm, raised and angry as they snaked up and down my forearm and bicep. I kept my eyes firmly in front of me on the table, trying my best to keep down the building panic twisting in my gut. I heard the rustle of papers being removed from the folder, the tapping of paper against the table, then silence. 

“Are you the grim reaper?”

The question tumbled out of me, spilling out of my mouth before I could stop it.

“I am far more powerful than an envoy. I do not merely lead people to their fate.”

Her voice was airy and old, cracking and straining as if unused for decades. It filled the room with a primordial dread and sorrow, bearing down on me with a crushing weight of understanding.

“Are you Death?”

“That is one name that was given to me. You may refer to me as such if it brings closure more rapidly.”

She paused, letting her words hang in the air like a cloud of smog before continuing.

“It is time to discuss why I’m here.” the woman hissed, her dry voice unreadable as I saw a paper slide into view.

The paper, despite her appearance, was strangely normal. Clean, unwrinkled, and slightly warm to the touch. It was like someone printed out a legal document and handed it to me.

I pick it up, carefully reading the document:

‘This document is for the recipient Thomas Reinhart to discuss the manner and matter of his upcoming death.’

My death?

“Is this some kind of sick joke?” I snort, my voice frigid but my gaze unmoving.

“I’m afraid not Mr. Reinhart. This is a discussion as old as the cosmos and your only opportunity to decide on your fate.” she says, an odd rattle of life returning to her voice as she speaks.

I looked up at her, just in time to see her appearance morph again. Her features softened as her hair, skin, and eyes returned to their former splendor. Her expression was still very matter of fact, but I now saw a wise, ancientness behind her gaze.

“You have to be. Discussing my death? Why not just kill me in my sleep or hit me with a bus?” I scoffed again, sliding the paper back towards her.

“I’m afraid those fates are unearned.” She droned, sliding the paper back towards me to punctuate her point.

Unearned? I didn’t earn the right to die by bus? I looked back down at the paper, noticing that her finger was pointing to two choices.

‘The recipient, due to the deeds and actions within their lifespan, may choose between dying in a house fire or being beaten to death by a stranger.’

My eyes widened as an audible gasp spilled out of my lips. These were horrific options. Absolutely barbaric ways to die. I got to choose between being beaten or burning alive? Why these deaths? Why now? Why do I have to choose between these deaths?

“Okay, there must be a mistake. These are violent and cruel. Surely there is something better than that you can offer me.” I laugh coldly, sliding the paper away before meeting her gaze.

She did not laugh.

“This is it. These are your fates. This decision was made using a variety of choices that you made and the circumstances behind them. Your fate is fair and reflects your character on earth.” she stated plainly, opening the envelope in front of her and pulling out another piece of paper as she spoke.

“The choices that I made? That seems a little dramatic. What were these decisions anyway that caused you to give me such a shit deal?” I challenged, leaning on the table towards her. I dared her, in that moment, to give me any room to argue for something nice and peaceful. 

She slid a piece of paper in front of me silently, resting her fingers on the page momentarily before slowly withdrawing them. I looked down at the paper, freezing as I read the contents. 

The page was filled with words and  numbers. Everything was spaced out evenly and in a well organized fashion, with dozens of entries spanning down the length of the page.

It was a list of all the times that I stole from others. The small sums, the big illegal acts I got away with, and all the other ways I lined my pockets at the expense of others. The page was divided by dates and times, listed out point by point. Next to the times, sat a small summary of events:

‘October 5, 2022         11:37   Told client that balance remained for services. Pocketed cash.

‘November 22, 2022   15:13   Falsely claimed share of inheritance of deceased client.

‘April 30, 2023            10:58   Undermined then claimed coworker’s client and billable hours.

‘September 16, 2023  07:50   Embezzled funds from the pro bono project you ran.’

It went on and on, for what seemed like several years. 

I blinked, shocked that I was staring at information that I had no idea she could have had access to. How did she get this? There was no way she could have gotten this without being who she said she was. 

However, dying in a fire based on some misappropriated funds? That is ludacris.

“So I took money from people. I stole and I know that it was wrong. Bu-” I started.

She jumped in before I can continue.

“You robbed the poor to fatten your greedy belly. You took food out of the mouths of children and birthrights away from the inherited. You preyed upon the desperate, the in need, the ones who needed your help in a time of great turmoil. You used your position of power to abuse those who trusted you.”

She reached out a finger, slowly running her finger down the page.

“From the time you were accepted to the bar, until yesterday.”

Her finger stopped at the bottom of the page, pointing to the last entry:

‘December 10, 2024   14:02   Falsely reported a client to authorities to claim reward money.’

Shit.

“I did what I thought was right. I didn’t know tha-”

“Come now Tom. You are a smart boy. You knew that he didn’t match the description. You knew that the story he gave you didn’t line up with the person they were looking for.” She giggled without humor, her voice cold and accusing.

And she was right. I did know better. I knew that giving him up would condemn an innocent man to a lifetime of confinement.

“Okay, so I stole. That doesn’t justify these fates.” I argued, pointing back to the document looming off to the side.

She waved her hand above the paper in front of me. The paper burst into flames and burned up into a plume of smoke within seconds, wafting up and disappearing into thin air.

“You’re correct Mr. Reinhart. Theft alone does not justify the fates offered. Even the most egregious acts of theft can eventually be replenished. Money changes hands often and your estate would correct the wrongs of the past when you pass.”

She then slid another piece of paper in front of me, this time showing an image. It was a selfie, with three people smiling into the camera. I sit in the middle, with two women sitting on either side of me. I immediately recognized the pictured women as my ex-wife and her best friend. Both were smiling into the camera, with my wife leaning her head on my shoulder in the picture.

I suppose that calling them best friends would be inaccurate now. They were best friends. That was true at one point. After all, they had grown up together since they were in diapers after all.

That was until my ex-wife caught us in bed together when she arrived home from work early. It had been going on for a few months by that point and we had gotten sloppy. My wife never expected a thing, as we passed under the radar with just a passing glance and a nod. The divorce came shortly after and was brutal for everyone. I drug my heels in the vain hope of convincing her to forgive my mistake, but she eventually pushed it through. She was rewarded with our savings and the house, while I kept the car and half of the bank account. She and her best friend had a permanent falling out when all the chips fell. I also lost contact with my affair partner, as she blamed me for losing her best friend.

This was a month ago. This picture was taken shortly before it all fell apart, when they were both still happy and were still inseparable. 

I was silent, feeling a pang of guilt as I drank in the photo. 

“I assume you understand why I show you this picture.” the woman said, not as a question but as an undeniable fact.

“Yeah, I do.” I swallowed, pushing the picture out of sight to tear away the memories.

“Oh no. Can you not stand looking at what you did?” she asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm as she slid the paper back into view. 

“Am I not allowed to feel remorse?” I asked in disgust, sliding the paper away from me and towards her voice to punctuate my point. 

A pause, then the fwoosh of flames and the smell of burnt paper.

“I suppose you could, if you actually felt bad. However, I would be more willing to bet that you are more upset about being caught than actually hurting people.” the woman said, her voice stoney.

“How dare you?” I asked, standing up from my chair and causing it to topple to the floor as I felt anger bubble out of my chest. I looked up to glare at her, a bright and hot fury burning in my chest.

She looked back at me, looking absolutely bored with the interaction. She didn’t make a move, simply leaning against the back of the chair as if talking about the game last night or the weather.

“Did you tell her yourself?”

“What?” I asked, taken aback at her lack of reaction.

Did you tell her yourself?”

The woman smirked a bit, her eyes icy blue and sharp. The accusation behind them is palpable, practically dripping out of every pore on her arrogant face. 

“No, because I didn’t want to hurt her. I also didn’t deny it when she asked me and gave her the closure she needed.” I countered, stepping closer to her as my confidence began to build.

She stood as well, crossing her arms as she looked me up and down. 

She then, with a starting snort, burst into laughter. I stood there, absolutely dumbfounded as she belly-laughed for what felt like several minutes before she regained her composure.

“That excuse never gets old.” she giggled, the laughs finally dying down enough for her to speak again.

“What do you mean?” I asked, my confidence withering at the sudden outburst of laughter.

“You think that, because you didn’t tell her, you were saving her from the pain of finding out that the one person that she is supposed to trust the most in the world violated that trust in the most fundamental way?” she asked, taking a step closer to me. 

I instinctively took a step back, but she continued while continuing to close the distance.

“You think that you didn’t want to hurt her while knowing that this act would likely ruin her friendship beyond any hope of repair? You didn’t want to hurt her when you actively hid the affair for several months and actively attempted to cover your tracks while indulging your hedonism? Do you think that it matters when two hearts were broken due to your negligent malice?”

She was now directly in front of me. She was physically imposing despite being much shorter than me, leaving no space between her and me. I had absentmindedly backed into the wall, shrinking further and further into the wallpaper as she got closer and closer. Her eyes were back to that dead white gloss, with her sneer bigger than should be possible for her face. 

“You broke the vow of holy matrimony. You committed adultery and destroyed two lives. I would have far more respect for you if you just said you wanted a little on the side than giving me that sorry ass excuse. You would at least be honest.”

She was suddenly back at the table, as if being chopped out of existence and placed back in her chair. Her legs were crossed and she was relaxed, her eyes returning back to their ice blue hue. 

“Well, I guess we should make those three women’s lives you personally ruined.” She sighed, sliding the envelope across the table to the spot in front of the toppled chair. 

I took a few seconds to compose myself, feeling my heart race and my vision get blurry. I eventually trudged back to the table, picking the chair up off the floor and taking a seat. 

I opened the envelope, sliding out the final picture from inside.

Instantly, everything goes cold. I felt nauseous as a stoic face stared back at me. The face is that of a young man, 16 years old. His hair is messy and he stares directly into the camera. He looks as though he was woken up to take this photo, with his eyes half awake and generally bleary. The background is plain, with only sporadic, evenly spaced lines marking up the wall in the background.

This was me. This was a mugshot of mine before my dad sealed my record and got the rape charges dropped.

God. I wish I could have the humanity to say that I remember what happened that night. I wish I could say that I remembered her name. But I can’t. The only thing that I remember is going to a party, drinking, seeing her that night, and her screaming and begging for me to stop. I remember the scratches, the running, the disappointment on my dad’s face.

I remember taking this mugshot though. I was pulled out of my house by two stern looking cops, brought to the station, and booked. I stayed for a little over a week until my dad was able to convince the chief to drop the case and seal my record to not ruin my future. The chief claimed lack of evidence, but he might as well have said that his drinking buddy called in a favor. It was actually a major reason why we moved out of the small town that I grew up in and to the city.

I put the paper back down on the table, a rock tumbling in my gut as she spoke.

“Everywhere you go, everything you do, broken people and ruined lives lie in your wake. You wonder why you have to suffer when you die? You lie, steal, cheat, and rob others of sovereignty. You are lucky that you aren’t being disemboweled.” she says, her voice pointed and poisonous.

I looked up just in time to see her grin, savoring my pain and fear.

“Not yet anyway.”

“Isn’t there something I can do to make this better? Surely there is some way to make this more humane!” I almost yelled, my panic palpable as I felt the walls begin to close around me.

She tilted her head, as if curious at my stubbornness despite overwhelming evidence. 

“You had an entire lifetime to decide your fate. An entire lifetime to develop the virtues and sins that follow your existence. You have chosen long before your fate was decided. This fate is inevitable” she said, seemingly irritated that I was grasping at straws despite the finality of my fate.

“What if I changed today? What if I dedicated the rest of my days to-”

She cut me off with a loud slam against the table top. I jumped as the air was filled with the smell of smoke, feeling the heat of the flames before abruptly vanishing. Her eyes, while back to being a cloudy white, burned with a rage that I had not seen before or since. Her hand was still pressed firmly against the table, a thin, frail finger poking into the paper as she pointed to a line:

‘The recipient’s fate, upon receiving the notice, shall be carried out at 5 am, tomorrow.’

The day and time were filled in manually, the handwriting pristine and gorgeous against the ominous words that precede it.

Tomorrow.

Tomorrow, I die. 

I felt all the blood drain from my face as I realized how screwed I was. Even if I could completely turn my life around, I did not have time. My fate was cast in stone, and it was hopeless to fight it.

“What if I don’t choose? That’s an option, right? I could just not choose and then you won’t have any way to know how I die.” I stammered, feeling a sudden rise of indignation rising in my chest. 

After all, this wasn’t fair. I shouldn’t have to choose between two gruesome deaths because I made some mistakes. There has to be a better way. A peaceful way. A more dignified way.

She was silent for a long while, seemingly thinking. Her expression was hard to read, as if I was staring at a stone wall. 

Suddenly, she was directly in front of me. It was if she had teleported, as my eyes didn’t even see a twitch of a muscle before she moved. She had climbed on top of the table, sitting on her knees with her face inches from mine. The light in her eyes was gone again, yet her lips stretched into a large grin. She looked absolutely giddy, her eyes shining with an excitement found only in the thoughts that brought pure euphoria. Her hand was placed against my chest, gentle yet tinged with malicious intent, as if she were going to yank my heart out of my chest.

“If you don’t choose, then I get to. If that happens, I am not bound to the choices that I have offered you. I will be allowed to pull from any death that you can and cannot fathom. Pain and suffering that can seem to stretch into eons. Pain that will have you begging for death. Fates that have happened for centuries or have never been seen.” she giggled, tightly gripping onto my shirt as I tried to pull away.

”I promise that it will be my magnum opus. Something truly beautiful to behold.”

She cooed the words, her voice purring with an almost lustful tone. I felt her finger on her other hand slowly glide against my neck as she spoke. Something sharp drug against my throat, stopping against the artery in my neck. I shivered, choking down a sob as she tapped impatiently.

“Maybe I should take the choice away. Why should cruel men like you get the luxury of choice when you deprive others of their autonomy?” she asked, her words pointed as the sharp point pressed against my vein. The thin skin of my neck barely kept the point at bay, threatening to drain my blood in seconds if cut. 

Just as suddenly, she was gone. The pressure eased, with relief quickly washing over me. I released the breath I didn’t know I was holding, collapsing against the table top as the rest of my strength sapped away. I heard the door creak open before she called back to me.

“You have until midnight to decide. Or I will decide for you.”

With that, the door slammed shut.

This all happened yesterday.

I don’t know what to do. It is 11:50 pm and I don’t know what to do. Should I feel the agony of my body burning and eventually suffocate on soot and smoke? Should I pick a fight I know I can’t win and feel the terror of the world going black in a flurry of punches?

Please help me. 

I know that I have not been a good man. Hell, I know that I have been an awful man. I know that, for all my accomplishments, that my faults have defined my life. I know that. I am not asking for sympathy or for forgiveness. I am asking for a decision, some clarity in a situation I know I won’t make it out of alive.

Please.

Oh god. She’s back. I heard her. Just a light creak of floorboard as she is undeniably sneaking through the house. She has probably already planned out her magnum opus, with me as the sickening finale to her symphony of horror and agony. I can see her now, her milky white eyes piercing the dark as she stares at me. She's just waiting for the clock to run out. Then she will be given the power to unleash untold fates that I no longer control.

Please help me.

I’m almost out of time.
