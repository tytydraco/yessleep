I woke up, choking and gasping like a fish out of water. My screams erupted, raw and desperate, mingling with the pain that coursed through me. It took agonizing minutes for me to regain a semblance of control, my cries morphing into sobs of horror. “PLEASE! PLEASE! SOMEONE MAKE IT STOP!” I begged, tears streaming down my face in a torrent of anguish.

The physical pain of my death was excruciating, but the emotional devastation of losing Myra overshadowed it all. Her struggle, the fear in her eyes as she fought for air—those memories haunted me relentlessly. I still wake up screaming some nights, reliving the moments that played like a twisted film reel in my mind.

As my screams subsided into ragged breaths, a familiar voice pulled me back from the edge of despair. “Jude, honey. Please calm down. Shhh… Shhh…” Myra had awakened beside me, her eyes wide with concern. She clung to my arm, her own fear reflecting in her gaze. At that moment, I realized the fragile thread of our reality, and the terror of losing her lingered like an unshakable shadow.

When I looked into her terrified eyes, a fresh wave of sobs overtook me, softer this time—tears of exhaustion, relief, and deep, aching pain. “M-myra…” I cried, my voice cracking as I reached out to pull her into a deep embrace. Her warmth enveloped me, and I could hear her quiet sniffles, a reflection of the fear she must have felt waking up next to a man in such distress.

After what felt like an eternity, I sluggishly slid out of bed, huffing and sniffling all the way to the bathroom. I needed to wash my face, to rid myself of the traces of my breakdown in front of my helpless girlfriend.

As I glanced in the mirror, I was met with a sight that made my heart sink. My eyes were puffy, my face swollen and red, a testament to the emotional storm that had just passed. I leaned down, turned on the cold water, and splashed it over my face repeatedly, hoping to cleanse away the remnants of my tears. But when I looked up again, something felt off.

“That’s not my face…” I mumbled, staring at the stranger reflected back at me. It bore a striking resemblance to my brother—not Jesse, but someone who could easily be mistaken for me. If we stood side by side in public, someone might even think we were Doppelgangers. The similarity was uncanny, as if someone had tried to sketch my likeness from memory. But I knew what this was—just another twist in the nightmare that had become my life after each painful death.

“Fuck!” I shouted, slamming my hands down onto the ceramic sink in frustration. Anger surged through me like a wildfire. Myra rushed in with a cup of water, concern etched across her face. “Jude, please, come to the living room,” she urged gently. I nodded and followed her to the couch, our bodies angled toward each other in a mix of worry and comfort.

I struggled to meet her gaze, the weight of my truth pressing down on me. After a tense silence, she finally spoke. “What happened?” Her voice was filled with genuine concern. I took a deep breath, knowing I had to tread carefully. How could I explain this?

“I sometimes have these vivid night terrors,” I began, trying to soften the blow. “It all started when I was seven. I crawled into a dresser drawer during a game of hide-and-seek and suffocated to death. My brother Jesse was the seeker, but he never found me. Not until it was too late.” I paused, my throat tightening with the memory. I had never openly shared this before, but after nearly losing her, I felt she deserved to know.

“I woke up in my bed after dying, screaming and crying to my mom about what had happened. She comforted me, but when I told her Jesse wasn’t able to find me, she asked me who Jesse was.” I glanced down at the glass of water, the gravity of my past weighing heavily on my heart.

“Wait, you told me Jesse suffocated in a dresser and died. You didn’t want me to bring him up because it would upset your family,” she said, her brow furrowed in concern.

“I know, Myra. But how do you explain this without sounding like a lunatic?” I pleaded, searching her eyes for understanding. She looked at me intently, as if silently urging me to continue.

“When I was thirteen, I went to a party at a lake with friends. We were drinking, and someone dared me to jump off a fifteen-foot cliff. I was drunk and wanted to look tough. But when I jumped, I hit shallow water and broke my neck, shattered my skull—and I died.” I took a shaky breath, bracing myself for her reaction. She was just listening, her focus unwavering.

“I woke up in a wet field after that. I got a ride home, and when I walked through the front door, there was Beans, the dog I had never seen before. He appeared in my life as quickly as Jesse had disappeared. I started writing everything down, trying to make sense of it all, but I was just a kid. It messed me up.” I fidgeted with my hands, uncertain about how much more I should reveal.

“And you had another one?” she encouraged me to continue, her voice steady.

“Yeah. It was the worst one.” I tried to steady my breath. “You and I were on our way to meet Maddie. We decided to take a back road, and while crossing a bridge…” I inhaled deeply, the memories rushing back. “It broke, and we fell in. Myra… you died in my arms,” I confessed, tears streaming down my cheeks as I struggled to articulate the horror. “We drowned in the car. I can’t explain the details. Please don’t ask me to relive that,” I begged.

She shook her head, gently wiping a tear from my cheek. “Has anything changed this time?” Her sincerity cut through my despair.

“My face,” I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. “It’s not mine. It’s close, but I don’t have the same nose or eyes. My features look like someone tried to draw me from memory. Imagine looking in the mirror at a stranger. I don’t want to live like this anymore.”

Myra scooted closer, her warmth radiating against me as she clung to my arm. “Jude… we’ll figure this out. I can’t imagine what you’ve gone through, but you need to know that in my world, this is the face I fell in love with. You’re my savior. I love you.” Her words wrapped around me like a lifeline.

We spent the rest of the night together, talking through the complex feelings I had never been able to face alone. It hurt deeply, but having her by my side felt like a light on my damaged soul. 

I added the incident to my journal, which I started at fourteen. It hurt deeply to know this was a problem that wouldn’t just go away. The PTSD lingered from the deaths I’d been through. I woke up crying, kicking, and screaming regularly. Nowhere near the level of when I died, but it always startled Myra when she stayed over.

I felt guilty for killing her. It was an accident, but she was at risk just by being with me. Myra had died in the reality I lived in before this one. She looked the same, and acted the same, but how long would this Myra exist? Until I died again, leaving her behind to suffer. It changed how I saw people. How I saw her.

I wanted more than anything to marry her, but she had to know it would most likely be temporary. I would love her as deeply as I could until she vanished. I decided to write her a note, something she could hold onto when I was gone.

I scribbled the letter, tears blurring the words, knowing she would read it someday. I folded it carefully and placed it in a wooden box, hiding it in my closet. That night, I decided to buy her a ring and propose. I couldn’t think of losing her; I had to focus on loving her, here and now. I picked out a dainty ring for her delicate fingers, and a few weeks later, I asked her to wear her favorite dress. We returned to the art gallery where we first met, and when we reached her favorite section, I knelt down. “Will you marry me?”

She said yes. We decided on a courthouse wedding—small, just like her. October 10th, the day we became husband and wife. She wore a beautiful white sweater dress, her hair loose, her eyes bright. I did my best to look presentable, even with the face I was still learning to accept as mine. After we got our certificate, we went to the park, sitting by the lake, feeding ducks.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out the wooden box. “Myra,” I said, a little nervous, “this is yours to hold onto.” She cupped it gently.

“What is it?” she asked, starting to open it.

“No, you can’t,” I said softly, brushing her hand aside. “Only when I’m gone.” I didn’t use the word “death,” but she understood.

She nodded, her eyes full of that familiar understanding. She kissed me gently, then rested her head on my shoulder. We sat in silence, the fall breeze whispering around us. She was my wife. I was her husband. And I loved her more than anyone I had ever loved before.

I was twenty-three, and she was twenty-four when she came into the living room with a small stick in her hand. She held it up, close enough for me to see the two faint gray lines. She was pregnant.

It was a difficult moment for me. I was overjoyed that we would finally have a child together, but fear quickly crept in. What kind of father would I be, if I even got the chance to be one? She wanted to keep the baby, and who was I to tell her no? I knew she would be a wonderful mother, and if I could, I would try my best to be a father. But deep down, there was an inkling I couldn’t shake—that I would never meet this child.

Six months into the pregnancy, my worst fear came true. Myra died from preeclampsia. It killed her and our daughter, and the doctors couldn’t save either of them. I knew, eventually, Myra would vanish from my life, but not like this. Not like this. Even now, it’s hard for me to describe the pain. I had hoped that if anyone were to leave, it would be me, and she would stay, healthy and young, with her whole life ahead of her. But she didn’t get a second chance. My world shattered in a way I had never experienced before.

The time that followed is just a blur. I could barely get out of bed in the morning, and most days, I didn’t even bother. It lasted for months, until my sister, Maddie, came to take care of me like I was some kind of hospice patient. She was a godsend. She cooked, cleaned, helped with bills. Maddie and I had always been close, but what she did for me during that time—it was more than I could have ever asked for.

One day, while cleaning up the bedroom and sorting through old things, she pulled a little wooden box out of the closet. “Do you need this?” she asked, trying to clear out things I might no longer want. My heart sank. I had completely forgotten about the letter I had written for Myra. It had been three years since I had sat down to write it.

“Yes, I need that. Actually, just give it to me. I want to keep it,” I said, trying to stay calm. I took the box from her hands, then grabbed my keys from the table by the front door.

“Where are you going?” Maddie asked, confused.

“I’ll be back. I’m fine,” I replied, quickly heading out to my car. I drove straight to Myra and Lilly’s gravesite. Her name was going to be Lilly...

When I arrived, I knelt down beside them, the letter clutched tightly in my hand. I opened it and began reading, my voice shaky, struggling to keep it together.

*Myra, if you’re reading this, you are my wife. It also means that I’m gone. I’ve left this world behind, and I hope that this time, you weren’t afflicted by the curse that haunts my ever-changing life. I want you to know that although I have left this world, I have started over in a new one. I have already woken up somewhere, and hopefully, you are by my side. You are the only person who I have ever tried to explain this to, and your heart has changed my life for the better. My life is hard. I know it sounds a little melodramatic, but it’s the truth. I know that I can rest easy, knowing that you are safe from the torturous cycle I am forced to live through. I hope you can find someone who will take care of you this time around. You have done more for me than anyone has ever dared to. You are a strong woman who deserves a life full of love and happiness. If you love me, even a fraction of the love I have for you, I know this is going to hurt badly. I know you will cry, and I know you will always question the night terrors I’ve shared with you. And that’s okay. Just wish for me that you didn’t disappear from my life as I have yours. I am sorry. I am truly sorry Myra, and I love you…*

*-Jude*

The context of the letter had completely flipped. I had never once considered that I could lose someone naturally. Nothing about my life had been natural up to this point. Yet there I was, sitting beside her grave, my chest hollow, my world shattered. I stayed until the sky turned black and the stars appeared, flickering above us like silent spectators to my grief. I didn’t want to leave her side ever again.

Something in me finally broke.

That night, I made a decision I knew was crazy, but I didn’t care anymore. I thought back to the time I died—jumping off that cliff, Beans appearing like he’d always been there. If I died again, maybe Myra would come back. Maybe the twisted rules of this existence would offer me that one mercy.

There were no rules I understood in this game, but what did I have to lose? I had infinite chances, didn’t I? An infinite number of times to find her again.

The first time I tried, I went out with a bang. I’ll spare the details, but I thought it would work. Like every time before, I woke up gasping, panting—alive. Only this time, when I came to, I was still sitting at her gravesite. It was the next morning. My head spun with disbelief. I begged, and pleaded, praying to whatever gods might be listening.

"Please... Please bring her back. I’ll do anything, anything to see her face one more time."

I tried again.

When I woke up the second time, in the same place, I cursed the sky, screamed until my throat burned, and threw a tantrum like a child denied their most precious thing. I never got what I wanted. I never got what I needed.

It finally hit me—she wasn’t coming back. Not this time.

I didn’t know what else to do but run. I drained my savings, closed the account, and disappeared. I drove to a bus station, left my car, and rode until I was sure no one would ever find me. I ended up in a small town in the Midwest. Population four hundred. I bought a house with fake documents I paid far too much for. I laid low for years.

No friends. No family. No going out. I wasn’t about to risk contact with anyone who might recognize me, or worse, anyone I loved. What had changed after I died twice? My face—the one I barely recognized since that night—remained the same, but everything else felt fragile.

So I kept it simple. No changes. No complications. A quiet life, hoping that if I stayed hidden, nothing could harm me again. 

It worked for years. I was content being a hollowed-out version of myself, a shell of who I once was. It felt safer that way—safer than trying to love again, safer than hoping.

I died again when I was thirty-four. Hit by a car on my way home from the grocery store. Pathetic, really. The kind of death that doesn’t even make headlines. When I woke up, the only thing that had changed was the layout of my house. It wasn’t a massive shift, just enough to throw me off balance for a moment.

 It confirmed what I already suspected—whatever this was, it was just to mess with me. The world didn’t change, just the scenery. And honestly, that was a welcome change. Something new, something unfamiliar, even if it was only my furniture rearranged by some cosmic force.

But over time, I grew bitter. More bitter than I ever thought possible. What really fucked me up was the fact that no one else’s life was touched by this madness. The neighbors carried on like always, completely unaware. It drove me insane that their lives were safe, and steady, while I was trapped in this twisted cycle. They were untouched by my existence unless I made the mistake of befriending them. As long as I kept my distance, they were safe from whatever curse had latched onto me.

The only thing that kept me going was the fact that I had no choice. I even thought at one point, this wouldn’t even be that bad if I could just start over every time. A newborn can’t remember anything. And why did I have to remember all of these horrific moments? What had I done to deserve such a shitty existence? 

I don’t know. I won’t ever know. How could I know?

The next few times I died, they were all my choice. Once I took a toaster in the bath, just because I could. It hurt a lot. Next, I decided to hang myself. That also was not very fun. So I decided to quit experimenting with it and to keep up the avoidance of death. I realized that no matter how much I hated living, I hated dying more.

My depression was arguably worse than anyone’s ever had been. But what could I do? I had to live with the truth that this would never end. So, I tried something new.

Rather than making connections with people, I turned to gardening. Myra loved plants, so I bought some for the house and started a small tomato patch in the backyard. I even put up a tall privacy fence, so no one—neither people nor animals—could see inside. It helped more than I expected. I realized that no matter what changed, I could always have plants. If one went missing or died, I could simply get another. It was something I could control, and that small truth has held up, even now.

I’m sixty-three years old. As I grow older, I can’t help but fear what might happen when I reach ninety. Will I finally get to rest? Or will I be forced to live forever, cursed to watch my body continue to decay, while I stay conscious inside it? I’m no Edward from *Twilight*—I’m aging. Someone would eventually notice a four-hundred-year-old pile of dust walking around town. But what if I start over again from the beginning? Will I be Jude once more? Do I get a chance at a normal life next time?

I don’t know. Those are the thoughts that haunt me every day. I’ve been forced into a life of suffering, so I’m doing my best to survive it. I have my plants, and I know Myra would be proud of that. Jesse would be proud. Beans too. I hold onto them in my heart, as tight as I can.

I know I’ll die again, likely of something natural—strokes, heart attacks, whatever finally takes the body down. But maybe that’s the key: natural causes. Maybe that’s what’ll finally end this. I guess I won’t know until the lights go out for good, or until I wake up in that cold bed once more.

All I ask is that you think of me because I can’t think of you. I don’t have that luxury. If someone, in this universe or the next, reads these words, it’s the only thing I have left. I’m sorry I can’t be your friend.

Pray to whatever you believe in that when you die, you don’t come back. I hope your souls rest easy when your time comes. I don’t feel the same bitterness I used to. At some point, I realized it only made me more miserable than I was already forced to be. Some days are harder than others, but I’ll get through them somehow. 

If you’ve read this twisted explanation of mine, thank you for hearing me out.
