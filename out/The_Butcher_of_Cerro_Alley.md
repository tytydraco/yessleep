When I moved to Jalisco from Oaxaca, everything seemed drier, quieter, more… watchful.
The people in the town were friendly, but there was always something strange in their eyes. Not curiosity, but judgment. Maybe because I was an outsider, or because —as some said— I was "too pretty to be alone."

My house was at the end of a narrow alley, next to a hill covered in mesquite trees. At night, the air smelled of damp earth and blood, because right in front there was an old butcher shop, the kind with hand-painted signs and plastic curtains covered in flies.

The owner was a big, quiet man, with reddish skin and huge hands. Everyone called him Don Severo, but the children said they shouldn't look him in the eye.
I saw him every day.
And he saw me too.
But his gaze wasn't normal.
It wasn't desire. It was hunger.
As if he was imagining me without skin.

The first night I heard the scratches, I thought they were rats.
Then the blows started to get heavier, rhythmic… like hooves.
Sometimes, just before dawn, a panting breath could be heard from the other side of my door. A deep growl, almost human, as if something was dragging itself through the mud.
When dawn broke, the door was full of marks: deep, horizontal, and the wood dented inwards.

I told Julian, my neighbor, everything. He was a young, kind guy, the only one I felt safe with.
When I told him about the hooves, he looked at me with a mixture of fear and resignation.
"You have to leave," he said. "People say the butcher is a *nahual*."
I let out a nervous laugh. But he didn't.
"They say he transforms… that he eats animals. And sometimes, people."

I didn't believe him. I couldn't believe it.
Until that night.

⸻

It was two in the morning when the blows started again.
But this time they weren't scratches. They were charges.
My door trembled with each blow, the hinges creaked.
I took my cell phone with trembling hands and dialed Julian.

"He's here!" I shouted. "Julian, he's out here!"
I heard his voice from the other side of the phone, agitated.
"Don't open. I'm coming over."

In a matter of seconds I heard footsteps running through the alley, then a dry noise, as if someone was dragging something metal.
I peeked out the window and saw him:
Julian was holding a broken broom handle.
And in front of my door… there was a pig.
But it wasn't an ordinary pig.
It was huge, swollen, its skin had dark spots like burns, and its eyes… were human.
The same eyes as the butcher.

The pig charged my door again and again, with impossible force.
Julian shouted at it, and the creature turned slowly.
When its eyes saw him, it stopped, lowered its head, and growled with a sound that didn't seem to come from an animal.
It was like a hoarse, distorted laugh.

Julian tried to scare it, raised the stick, but the monster lunged at him.
I heard him scream.
Then, a squeal, bones breaking, and the wet thud of something being torn apart.
I tried to open the door, but it was stuck, bent inwards.
I heard Julian crying and screaming at the same time.
"Help me! Please help me!"
I managed to push the door and ran out with an iron skillet.

Julian was on the ground, bleeding, while the beast was biting his leg.
With all my strength, I raised the skillet and hit the pig in the head.
The blow resonated as if I had hit a stone.
The animal staggered, looked up, and squealed.
At that moment, I saw it clearly:
One half of its face was no longer a pig's.
It was Don Severo, looking at me with one human eye and the other swollen, black.

He ran, growling, towards the hill, leaving a trail of blood and mud.

⸻

The next day, the town was silent.
Julian had to be taken to the hospital; he was missing part of his calf.
And when I passed in front of the butcher shop, Don Severo was there.
With a patch covering one eye and a huge bruise on his temple.
He looked at me.
He smiled.
And he raised his hand, waving as if nothing had happened.

That same afternoon, I packed everything.
Julian and I left the town without looking back.
I never knew if anyone else heard the blows that night.
But sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear that growl, scratching at the door.
As if the butcher's hunger was still looking for me.
