A cold hollow wind blew through the frozen trees, stirring the snowfall into icy swirls and it was beginning to get dark. At first we had made good progress towards making it back, however I was ambushed by a loose stone under the snow and slipped, spraining my ankle. Charles took my shoe off and bandaged my foot, but he was worried that I would get frostbite. 

We walked as far as I could with Charles supporting me until I was unable to continue. We weren’t in any way prepared for the night out and my cute new outfit wasn’t holding up so great as the temperatures dropped. I could tell from the look on my brother’s face that this wasn’t a good situation. I wondered how many lost hikers he’d found the morning after dead of exposure, how many of them probably experienced a situation exactly like this. I was too afraid to ask. 

“Hey, Claire, Why are mountains so funny?” He asked me suddenly. 

I stared at him blankly, I was sure he didn’t mean ‘funny haha’, but maybe ‘funny we’re going to die up here’? I didn’t answer as I tried to figure out exactly what he was trying to say so he continued. “Because they’re hill areas..!” He completed the joke and waited for me to get it. 

Admittedly it caught me by surprise and I burst into a nervous laughter. If he was cracking jokes, things were worse than I thought. This was something he did when things got really bad - tell awful jokes to try to distract me from the immediate horrible circumstances. “We’re really f* cked aren’t we?” I asked through the giggles. 

“..Ahh, probably.” He admitted, laughing with me then so that we were just a couple of idiots nervously cackling away as we realized how doomed we were. If I was able to keep going we would have made it back before nightfall, instead we had to stop and Charles was attempting to light a fire. I was about to suggest that he leave me and go for help when we began to hear the whirr of a snowmobile approaching. 

It had no lights on and so it was difficult to tell where it was approaching from until it was behind us. I heard it stop more than saw it, then someone stepped off it with their boots crunching on the snow. Charles subtly reached for a stick and moved me behind him as the person approached. I could only make out their silhouette and a faint glint at eye height on one side. I thought for one horrified moment that it was the Snow Witch that attacked us, then he spoke.

“You’re not going to be able to fight off much with a broken arm and a stick, Charles.” The voice was velvety and familiar.

“You scared me to death, why are you driving around without lights like a cartel member?” Charles demanded, though he still sounded relieved.

“The glare of bright light on snow hurts my eye.” Eric responded calmly as he walked close enough for us to see him through the dim light. “Why are you still out here in the dark? You were supposed to be back hours ago.” 

“We were attacked..” My brother grumbled.

“Attacked by what?” Eric asked tensely. 

“A woman in the snow with a bow and arrow..”

This gave him pause, I felt his gaze on me for a moment before he looked back at Charles, “I see, we’ll discuss that later then.” He said diplomatically.

“How did you find us?” I asked to break the uncomfortable silence that resulted from his statement. 

“I just followed the laughing.” He answered flatly and I felt my cheeks flush. I’m sure he thought we were halfwits. “You’re injured, can you walk?” 

“No.. I-“ I was in the process of explaining when he took me by the wrist, directing my arm over his shoulder before he scooped me up effortlessly. He supported the majority of my weight with his left hand under my back and his other arm under my legs, though he kept his right hand held somewhat awkwardly away from me as if he had wet nail polish on. It was both unexpected and mortifying as he carried me over to the snowmobile, I couldn’t think of anything to say. 

“I trust I don’t need to carry you as well Charles? Or would you prefer to stay here?” 

“Well, if the offer is there.” my brother answered and I knew he was teasing me, though I thought I saw Eric smile slightly in amusement at his comment. 

When we were back home I took a nice long shower assisted by a stool. My ankle looked horrible, but Charles was able to re-bandage it pretty well and Eric leant me his cane so I figured it’d be fine. Still, when I came out of the shower Charles and Eric were talking in the kitchen and I kind of hid around the corner to listen.

“Do you think it was a witch?” Charles was asking nervously.

“I don’t know, I didn’t see her. It’s not uncommon for witches to be a part of a coven and you might have p* ssed them off killing one. But, she wasn’t experienced, she summoned spirits without having a host ready and the energy burned her up in the end. It didn’t seem like she had any guidance.” Eric responded thoughtfully. 

“I saw her father on the news..” 

“So?”

“I feel horrible, I keep.. Replaying the moments in my head-..” 

“Stop it.” Eric cut him off, “You didn’t shoot a little girl. You shot a monster. There was nothing left of whoever she was before. Believe me, true witches basically don’t exist anymore, they went functionally extinct centuries ago. The witches of today are usually little more than pretenders. They access an energy they don’t understand and their bodies can’t withstand it.” 

“How do you know all this..?” 

“Because I was taught.” 

“…Are you a witch?” 

This time there was a moment of stunned silence before Eric responded, “I’m not a witch, the power I have is entirely different.” 

“Will you ever trust me enough to tell me..?” Charles asked more softly, almost like he was speaking to himself.

“I’m not trying to hide from you.. I just-“ Eric started, though I decided to make my presence known then, it felt wrong to eavesdrop on a conversation that seemed so personal. 

“I’m SO hungry! What’s for dinner? Oh, sorry! Am I interrupting?” I asked as I rounded the corner into the room. Eric was in the kitchen leaning across the bench top toward Charles who was sitting across from him. When I entered they both moved back slightly from each other.

“Eric’s making some sort of tofu lasagne or something.” 

“Butternut and spinach lasagne.” he corrected my brother. 

“Well, it smells amazing!” I said cheerfully, entirely ignoring the mild tension in the room as I limped over. It was strange to see Eric so domestic, he was far too angelic for Charles’s basic kitchen and I noticed when he cooked he used his left hand almost exclusively. More or less only using the right for support and still holding his long nails away from things. I wondered why he didn’t just cut them if they were in the way that much? Regardless, the lasagne was surprisingly nice. I’d never had anything like it before and it had good flavor, but I did have to add salt to it. 

Eric stayed the night, he slept on the couch and his presence did make me feel strangely better. However, as it was nearing 1:30am I awoke. I don’t know what disturbed me, maybe something outside, since my room faced the forest behind the building? Anyway, I got up to get a glass of water then decided that a night walk would be a good idea. Now I can’t stress enough how safe a night walk usually is. I’ve been on hundreds. 

I get nightmares and I’ve always found that a walk in the cold night air really helps so I got myself ready and headed out with Eric’s cane supporting me. I knew I wouldn’t be able to get far, so I thought just another short trip around the block would do. On the way out I passed Eric, he was curled up and sleeping peacefully on the couch, though he wasn’t covered by any blankets so I gently laid one over him. 

When I was up close I could see that his arm had shapes or symbols down the length of it, from what little I know it looked a bit like norse writing? I was sure I hadn’t seen anything in the daylight, but in the dark those parts seemed to very faintly glow. I wondered what kind of ink the tattoos used to be luminescent like that…

Once I was outside the cold was bracing. Falling snowflakes glittered under the overhead lights all the way down the street and my breath frosted up in the cool air before me. The only sound was that of my own footsteps shuffling along as I limped down the street before resting at the corner. It was nice just to exist without stressing too much. I know this will sound dumb, but I worry about my brother a lot. His job is kind of dangerous, what if he gets shot at or something? Not that I really think that will ever happen in a town like this. But still.. 

I’m not sure how long I spent outside, it didn’t feel like that long, however, as I started to make my way back I noticed a figure had stepped into my path. I recognised her immediately, long platinum hair and a gothic lolita dress - she was pretty hard not to remember. Now that she was closer I could tell her eyes were a lustrous brown and in a weird way she reminded me of Eric, just something about her aura seemed a kin to his. On her cheek below her left eye was a white crescent shape that shone slightly in the dim lighting, and under her other eye was a darker complete circle. 

She held her bow low and watched me for a moment as if she was calculating something, then she asked very calmly, “Where is Eric Linnaeus?” 

I didn’t know what to say, but surely you’re not supposed to tell dangerous strangers where your friends are? So I lied. “I don’t know anyone by that name..” I could hear the fear in my own voice so I’m sure she could as well. 

“Let’s not play games. You’re using his cane.” She responded flatly. 

I felt my cheeks heat with nervous panic, such a simple mistake to get called out on and I had no response to give. She sighed softly and raised the bow up now, aiming an arrow directly at me.

“Tell me where he is. I won’t ask a third time.” she stated firmly. 

“I-I….” I struggled to find words and I could feel tears starting to sting my eyes. Getting shot with an arrow certainly seemed like an unconventional way to go, but obviously I didn’t want to die. While at the same time, I didn’t really want to just give up my brother’s friend either. Thankfully as I was on the verge of breaking down, Eric appeared in the street. 

There was some distance between the three of us and he was still wearing the same clothes I had seen him in when he was asleep, still I’ve never been more relieved to see someone before. “Clair. Throw me my cane, right now.” He ordered and I did exactly as I was told without hesitation. I’ll admit it wasn’t a good throw, I’ve never been very athletic, though he still caught it with one hand. 

He unclipped a latch on the side that I hadn’t even noticed before and pulled a short sword from the hollow center of the cane. The woman turned to face him and let loose the arrow without a second’s hesitation. I have no idea how he moved fast enough to avoid it. As Eric closed the distance between them she fired a second arrow which he deflected off his arm and it splintered as it hit leaving no mark on his skin. 

When Eric got close enough to her that the ranged weapon was useless she switched to a twin set of daggers and met him head on in combat. Truthfully it was hard to follow the fight, they were both moving so quickly that all I really knew was the sound of metal on metal until they separated. Each retreating to an opposite side of the street to catch their breath as they circled each other cautiously. 

“What are your orders?” Eric asked her, his tone of voice was annoyed, but strangely not necessarily hostile. 

“ ‘Find Eric Linnaeus, access the threat, report back.’ “ she spoke in a monotone worse than his. It was like a robot repeating back commands. 

“I see..” He answered briefly as the woman attacked again. 

This time when they met the fight was more violent, as if the first round was just a test and now they were fighting in earnest. It lasted longer this time and ended when she stabbed a knife into his left leg, knocking him to the ground as she did. I thought she was going to kill him then, I felt a new wave of panic wash over me as I realised I was about to witness a murder when she stopped. 

She held the tip of the blade to his throat as she pinned him to the ground, “You lose.” She stated placidly. 

“The leg every time Calla?” Eric hissed. He was losing blood rapidly, I could see it leaking out onto the snow though neither of them seemed concerned. 

“You still don’t defend it well.” She answered and to my surprise, allowed him up. 

“What’s your assessment then?” He mused, sitting up and pulling the knife out. I might have been crazy, but I thought I saw blue sparks when he did and I noticed that though there was a hole in his pants, there was no longer a wound.

“Not a threat.” She responded simply.

“Good. Also, tell Markos he can go f* ck himself, that really hurt you know.” 

“Sorry..” She murmured as she slowly sank into his lap to hug him tightly. She hid her face in his neck and balled his shirt in her fists. I wasn’t sure if she was crying or not when he returned the hug holding her just as close. 

“It’s good to see you..”  I heard him whisper, but after a moment when she didn’t let go he added, “Calla.. You know the ground is cold right..?” 

The girl reluctantly got up then, “No, I can’t feel it..” She apologized.

“It’s okay..” He assured, though as they stood he looked to me, “Claire.. This is Calla.”  He introduced us. 

“Is it safe? I-I mean is she safe?” I asked, trying not to sound as afraid as I still was. Honestly, I was just trying to make sense of the situation and ignore the things I couldn’t understand. 

“Do you have any further orders?” Eric asked her firmly, to which she shook her head. “She’s not going to hurt you.” He assured me. 

“She tried to kill us on the mountain.” I corrected him anxiously. 

“I wasn’t trying to hurt you. I just wanted you to run back to Eric. But, the snow started moving quite quickly downward.. I wasn’t expecting that.” Calla spoke directly to me then, her voice was strangely soft and calming. 

“You could have just asked us about him if you’re friends!” I countered. 

At this Calla looked to Eric as if for a translation and he seemed at a loss for how to explain the concept of asking to her. Eventually he looked like he was about to speak when there was an explosion from down the street. We all turned to look and to my horror I saw that my brother’s apartment had just burst into flames. 

“Charles!” I screamed in a panic as I forced my injured ankle to support me so I could run back towards the apartment. 

“Was this you!?” Eric shouted at Calla. 

“No.” She answered sedately as if nothing at all were wrong. 

“Then stay with Claire. Stop her from hurting herself, be gentle about it.” He told her quickly and as he took off running for the apartment Calla caught my waist. She was smaller than I am and yet surprisingly strong, I couldn’t break free of her grip. 

“Let go of me! My Brother is in there!” I yelled trying to pry her arms off me.  

“Eric wishes for you to remain here.” She told me calmly, apparently entirely unfazed by my efforts. 

I saw Eric disappear into the flames and I desperately searched for the smallest sign of Charles. Smoke billowed out of the living room window and I could see the floor above was also on fire. I knew that wasn’t good. I could hear fire truck sirens in coming from a couple of streets over but that did nothing to calm me. It seemed like an agonizingly long time before Eric came back out and when he did he was alone coughing on smoke.

“Where is he?! Eric!” I begged for an answer, though I already knew what it would be. I could feel fat tears spilling over as he approached.

“Charles is gone, he wasn’t in there..” 

It’s been a couple days since then. I’ve been staying at a hotel with Eric and Calla.. He’s set her the task of baby sitting me, while he’s out searching. I don’t know who or what has taken my brother, but I want him back.. If anyone knows anything, please..
