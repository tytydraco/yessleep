I used to think the world was simple. You go to work, come home, binge a few shows, maybe grab a drink or two, and wake up to do it all over again. Life isn’t exciting, but it’s comfortable. Until you see something—or someone—that tears your concept of reality apart.

I don’t know what I saw. I don’t know if he’s a man or a monster, but I saw him. And I think I was never supposed to live to tell anyone about it.

It started three weeks ago. I was driving home late at night from my dead-end shift at the gas station. My car, a beat-up Honda Civic, coughed every time I pressed the accelerator, and the headlights barely cut through the thick fog rolling off the nearby woods. It was one of those nights where the darkness felt heavier, like it had weight.

I was cruising down a two-lane road when I saw him.

At first, I thought it was a deer—just a shadow on the side of the road, something barely visible in the mist. But as I got closer, I realized it wasn’t a deer. It was… human. Or at least shaped like one.

The figure stood perfectly still, right at the edge of the tree line. Too still. His silhouette was oddly thin, almost fragile, like a teenager who never grew into his frame. But the way he was standing—shoulders back, arms hanging loosely, head slightly tilted like he was waiting for something—made my skin crawl.

I slowed the car, my headlights washing over him. He was young. Couldn’t have been older than 18 or 19, with short, dark hair that looked like it had been carelessly pushed forward. He wore a hoodie, despite the heat, and sweatpants that hung loosely off his skinny frame. His hands dangled at his sides, fingers twitching slightly, like he was tapping out an invisible rhythm.

And then he turned his head.

His face was pale, almost ghostly, but his eyes—God, his eyes—were just wrong. Even from a distance, I could see the faintest glow, like embers barely smoldering in a fire. I couldn’t tell if it was a trick of the fog or my headlights, but the way they flickered… it felt deliberate. Like he wanted me to notice.

“Keep driving,” I muttered to myself, my voice trembling. But my foot hovered over the brake. There was something about him, something magnetic. It wasn’t curiosity—I was terrified—but I couldn’t look away.

He moved then, just a step forward, and I flinched. His lips curved into the smallest, most unsettling smirk. It wasn’t the kind of smile someone gives you to say hello—it was mocking, taunting. Like he knew I was scared. Like he liked it.

I didn’t think; I just hit the gas. The Civic groaned as it lurched forward, and I kept my eyes glued to the road ahead, refusing to look back.

But I swear, as I sped past, I heard him laugh.

It wasn’t a loud laugh—it was soft, almost like a chuckle—but it carried through the fog, sharp and clear. It didn’t sound human. It was too calm, too confident, like he’d already won some game I didn’t even know I was playing.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face, that smirk, those faintly glowing eyes. I told myself it was nothing, just some punk kid trying to scare drivers, but deep down, I knew better.

And then the dreams started.

Each night, I’d find myself back on that road, the fog thicker than before. The figure would be closer this time, standing in the middle of the lane, waiting. He never spoke, but his eyes burned brighter in the dreams, glowing like molten coals. I’d try to scream, but no sound would come out.

I began waking up drenched in sweat, my heart racing, convinced I could still hear his laugh echoing in my ears.

Last night was different.

I woke up to the sound of something tapping on my window.

At first, I thought it was a branch or maybe the wind. But then I heard it again—three slow, deliberate taps. I froze, my breath catching in my throat.

The room was dark, but the streetlight outside cast a faint glow through the blinds. I didn’t want to look. Every instinct in my body told me to stay under the covers, to pretend I hadn’t heard anything. But then I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned my head, just enough to see the outline of my window.

He was there.

Standing on the other side of the glass, staring down at me with that same smirk, his eyes faintly glowing in the darkness. His hands were pressed against the glass, leaving streaks in the condensation.

“Hey,” he said, his voice muffled but perfectly clear. “You look like shit.”

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe.

“Come on, man. Don’t be rude.” He tilted his head, tapping the glass with one finger. “Open up. I just want to talk.”

My heart was hammering so hard it felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. I didn’t move, didn’t even blink.

And then he laughed again.

It was louder this time, sharper, like he was right next to me. “Aw, you’re no fun. Fine. I’ll see you around, loser.”

He turned and walked away, vanishing into the shadows like he’d never been there at all.

I don’t know what he is. I don’t know why he’s tormenting me. But I know one thing for sure.

He’ll be back.

Weeks went by, and nothing unusual happened. Sure, I thought about that night—about the glowing eyes, the smirk, the laugh that seemed to burrow into my brain. But as the days passed, life crept back into its dull routine. Work, home, eat, sleep, repeat. The human mind does funny things when it comes to trauma; it smooths out the edges, convinces you it wasn’t that bad, maybe even makes you doubt it happened at all.

By the third week, I had all but convinced myself I had imagined it. Maybe it was exhaustion, or maybe I’d dozed off at the wheel. Hell, maybe I was losing my mind. Either way, I stopped checking over my shoulder when I walked to my car at night. I stopped flinching at the sound of soft laughter in the distance. I even stopped leaving the lights on in my apartment.

Life was normal again. Until it wasn’t.

It was a Friday night, and I’d just left a bar downtown. Nothing fancy, just a hole-in-the-wall kind of place where the drinks are cheap, and the bartender knows you by name. I wasn’t drunk, just buzzed enough to dull the edge of a long week. The streets were unusually quiet, the kind of quiet that feels staged, like the world is holding its breath.

The fog was back. Thick and heavy, rolling off the nearby river and swallowing the streetlights in its haze. As I walked to my car, I felt it—the faintest prickle at the back of my neck. That instinctive, primal sensation that tells you you’re being watched.

I stopped mid-step, my breath fogging in the cold air. The street was empty. Nothing but the hum of distant traffic and the occasional drip of water from a nearby gutter.

“Get a grip,” I muttered, shaking my head.

I unlocked my car, slid into the driver’s seat, and turned the key. The engine sputtered before roaring to life, and I felt a flicker of relief as the headlights cut through the fog.

That’s when I saw him.

He was standing in the middle of the road, directly in front of my car. Same hoodie, same sweatpants, same impossibly thin frame. But something was different this time. His posture was looser, more casual, like he was waiting for me to notice him. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, and his head was tilted just enough to catch the light.

I froze, my hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles turned white.

He took a step forward, the movement lazy and unhurried, like he had all the time in the world. The glow in his eyes was stronger now, pulsing faintly with every step he took.

“Hey, champ,” he called out, his voice smooth and teasing, like he was greeting an old friend. “Miss me?”

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

He grinned, the kind of grin that makes your stomach drop. “What, no ‘hi’? No ‘how’s it going’? You’re hurting my feelings here.”

My foot slammed on the gas. I wasn’t going to wait around for whatever game he was playing.

The car lunged forward, tires screeching as they struggled for traction. But just as I was about to hit him, he moved.

Not stepped aside. Moved.

It was like he wasn’t there one second and then was suddenly standing at my window the next, his hand slamming against the glass hard enough to make me jump.

“Rude,” he said, leaning down so I could see his face. His breath fogged the window as he stared at me, his eyes burning like hot coals.

I screamed, throwing the car into reverse and flooring it. The tires screeched again, the car jerking backward as I tried to put as much distance between us as possible.

But he didn’t chase me.

He just stood there in the middle of the road, watching, his smirk widening as the distance between us grew.

When I finally turned the corner and lost sight of him, I pulled over, my hands trembling so badly I could barely put the car in park. I sat there for what felt like hours, my chest heaving as I tried to calm down.

I didn’t sleep that night. Or the night after.

Because now I know he’s not just some figment of my imagination. He’s real. And he’s not done with me yet.

I was sitting on my couch that night, trying to pretend life was normal again. The TV was on, something familiar and mindless—The Walking Dead, maybe. Or was it The Big Bang Theory? I can’t even remember. My mind wasn’t really on the show; I was just letting it drone on in the background, hoping the noise would fill the silence that had started to feel suffocating lately.

That’s when I heard it.

A deep, thunderous sound that rattled my entire apartment, making the windows shake in their frames. It wasn’t just a noise—it was a feeling, a pressure in the air that made my chest tighten.

It reminded me of an airshow I’d been to as a kid, the way the jets would tear across the sky, leaving behind that deafening sonic boom. But this wasn’t an airshow. This was right here.

I froze, the remote slipping from my hand and clattering onto the floor. My first thought was that something had exploded nearby, but there wasn’t any fire, no screaming, no sirens. Just… silence.

A part of me wanted to stay right where I was, glued to the couch. But curiosity—or maybe stupidity—got the better of me. I grabbed my phone and headed for the door, my heart pounding in my chest.

When I stepped outside, the air felt different. Thicker. Charged, like the moments before a lightning storm. The street was eerily quiet, bathed in the pale orange glow of the streetlights.

And then I saw him.

He was standing in the middle of the street, his back to me, his head tilted up toward the sky. The same hoodie, the same sweatpants. He looked completely out of place, like some scrawny teenager who’d wandered into the wrong neighborhood.

But I knew better now.

“Hey!” I shouted, my voice cracking. I don’t even know why I said it—maybe I was hoping to scare him off, or maybe I was just tired of being afraid.

He turned slowly, almost lazily, and when his eyes met mine, I felt that same sickening chill crawl up my spine.

“Ah, there he is,” he said, grinning. His voice was calm, casual, like we were old friends catching up. “You finally decided to come say hi. Took you long enough.”

“What… what do you want?” I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper.

“What do I want?” He laughed, and it was sharp, cold, like nails scraping against glass. “Man, you’re slow, huh? I don’t want anything. I’m just having fun.”

“Fun?” I repeated, my stomach twisting. “You’ve been stalking me! Tormenting me!”

“Stalking?” He put a hand to his chest, feigning offense. “Whoa, whoa. That’s a little harsh, don’t you think? I mean, yeah, I’ve been keeping tabs on you, but that’s only because you’re so funny when you’re scared. The little gasps, the shaky hands, the way you freeze up like a deer in headlights—it’s golden.”

I clenched my fists, anger starting to bubble beneath my fear. “Why me?”

He tilted his head, studying me like I was some kind of puzzle. “Why not?”

“That’s not an answer!” I shouted, my voice shaking.

He shrugged, his grin widening. “Sure it is. You just don’t like it. You’re boring, dude. A nobody. You live your little nobody life, going through the motions, and for what? A paycheck? A few beers? A shitty rerun of The Walking Dead?”

I felt my chest tighten, the heat of humiliation rising to my face. “Shut up.”

“Oooh, there it is,” he said, his voice dripping with mockery. “A little bit of backbone. Look, I’ll level with you. I don’t need to mess with you. But I’ve got this… thing. A gift, you could say. And you? You’re like a rat in a cage. Poke you here, watch you scurry. Poke you there, watch you squeal. It’s entertaining.”

I couldn’t stop myself. “You think this is a game?”

He stepped closer, his eyes glowing faintly in the dark. “Everything’s a game, bud. And guess what? You’re losing.”

I backed up instinctively, my hands shaking. “You’re sick.”

“Maybe,” he said, stopping just a few feet away. “Or maybe I’m the only one who sees how pointless all this is. You. Them. All of it. I mean, look at you.” He gestured toward me, his smirk turning cruel. “You’re what, thirty? No savings, no prospects, no girlfriend. Just a walking waste of space waiting to rot. And here I am, giving your life some meaning.”

I swallowed hard, my throat dry. “You’re not human, are you?”

His grin widened, and for the first time, I saw something flicker behind his eyes. Amusement? Hunger? I couldn’t tell. “Does it matter?”

“Yes!” I shouted, my voice cracking. “It matters! What the hell are you?”

He leaned in closer, his face inches from mine now, his eyes glowing brighter. “I’m something you’ve always wished to . And the best part? You’ll never know if I’m real or if you’re just losing your fucking mind.”

Before I could react, he stepped back, his smirk returning. “Anyway, I’ve got places to be. People to scare. But don’t worry, bud—I’ll be seeing you. You can count on that.”

This part makes me question reality. He turned around and gave a mock salute and said “adios!” He ran so fast. Almost like he teleported. I know he didn’t because I saw for a brief moment, and streak as I heard that same explosion sound. 

I stood there for what felt like hours, my heart pounding in my ears, my hands shaking. I don’t know what he is, or why he’s chosen me.

I barely slept that night, not that I expected to. Every creak of my apartment, every gust of wind rattling the windows felt like a precursor to something worse. I kept the lights on, clutching a baseball bat I’d grabbed from the closet, as if that would do anything against… him.

I replayed our conversation over and over in my head. His words gnawed at me, especially that cruel little monologue about my life. The worst part? He wasn’t wrong. I was a nobody. I worked a dead-end job, I had no real friends, no prospects, no purpose. But how the hell did he know that? How did he know so much about me?

By morning, I had convinced myself of one thing: I couldn’t stay here. Not in this apartment, not in this city. He’d said he’d see me again, and I knew he meant it. I didn’t care if it made me look insane—I packed up whatever I could fit in my car and drove. I didn’t even have a destination in mind, just… away.

For a few days, it worked. I checked into cheap motels, changed locations every night, and avoided any main roads. I kept my phone off, thinking maybe he was tracking me somehow. My paranoia was in overdrive, but at least I hadn’t seen him. Maybe I’d finally outsmarted him.

But deep down, I knew it wouldn’t last.

It was my fourth night on the run. I’d found a little motel off a stretch of desolate highway, the kind of place where the clerk doesn’t ask questions and the water from the shower smells faintly of rust. I parked my car around the back, far from the main lot, and triple-checked the lock on my door before collapsing onto the bed.

I don’t know how long I slept, but I woke up to the sound of laughter.

Not the kind of laughter you’d hear from the room next door. No, this was his laugh. That sharp, mocking chuckle that I’d never forget.

I bolted upright, my heart pounding as I scanned the room. Nothing. The door was still locked, the window still shut. But the laughter didn’t stop. It seemed to echo all around me, filling the tiny room like it was coming from the walls themselves.

“Nice try, buddy,” his voice rang out, casual and taunting. “You thought you could ditch me? That’s adorable.”

I jumped to my feet, gripping the bat I’d been keeping by my side. “What do you want from me?” I shouted, my voice trembling.

The laughter stopped abruptly. The silence that followed was deafening. And then, without warning, the lights flickered and went out.

I was plunged into darkness.

“Aw, don’t be scared,” he said, his voice now coming from somewhere behind me. I spun around, swinging the bat wildly, but hit nothing but air.

“You can’t run from me,” he continued, his tone light and almost amused. “It’s cute that you tried, though. Really, it is. But come on, you’re smarter than that. Deep down, you know there’s no escaping me.”

“Leave me alone!” I screamed, swinging the bat again, harder this time.

Suddenly, the lights flickered back on, and he was standing right in front of me.

“Boo,” he said with a smirk.

I stumbled back, nearly tripping over the bed. He didn’t move, just stood there, his hands in his hoodie pockets, watching me with those faintly glowing eyes.

“Here’s the thing,” he said, his voice dropping to a lower, more menacing tone. “You can run. You can scream. Hell, you can even try to fight me if it makes you feel better. But it won’t matter. Because I’m not going anywhere. You’re stuck with me, pal.”

“Why?” I whispered, my voice barely audible.

He tilted his head, as if considering the question. “Why not?” he said again, his smirk widening. “Face it—you’re mine now. And you know what? I think we’re gonna have a lot of fun together.”

My grip on the bat tightened, my knuckles white. “I’ll kill you,” I said, though the words felt hollow even as I said them.

He burst out laughing, doubling over as if I’d just told the funniest joke in the world. “Kill me? Oh, man, that’s rich. You think you’re the main character in some action movie? Newsflash, buddy: you’re not a hero. You’re a scared little loser swinging a stick at something you can’t even comprehend.”

He stepped closer, and I swung the bat again. This time, it connected—sort of. The moment the bat hit him, it was like hitting solid steel. The impact jolted through my arms, and the bat clattered to the floor, splintered and useless.

His smirk never faltered. If anything, it grew wider.

“Feel better?” he asked, raising an eyebrow. “Or do you wanna try again? Go ahead—I’ll wait.”

I backed up until I hit the wall, my chest heaving.

“Relax,” he said, rolling his eyes. “I’m not gonna kill you. Not yet, anyway. Where’s the fun in that? No, I like you alive. You’re more entertaining that way.”

He leaned in closer, his face inches from mine now. His eyes were brighter than ever, glowing with a heat that felt almost tangible.

“But just so we’re clear,” he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. “You don’t get to escape me. Ever.”

And then, just like before, he was gone. One second he was there, and the next, I was alone in the room, the broken bat lying at my feet.

I don’t know how much longer I can take this. He’s in my head, in my life, and there’s nothing I can do to stop him.

I don’t know what he is.

The next day, I tried to convince myself it had all been a dream. A fucked-up, anxiety-fueled fever dream brought on by stress and sleep deprivation. I mean, come on—glowing eyes, a creepy teenage psychopath who can appear and disappear like some supernatural jackass? That’s not real. That can’t be real.

I spent the morning pacing around my shitty motel room, debating whether I should call someone—maybe the cops, or a therapist, or hell, even a priest. But what would I say? “Hi, officer, I think I’m being stalked by a glowing-eyed, hoodie-wearing little shit who gets off on tormenting me?” Yeah, I’d be in a padded room before lunch.

I was in the middle of convincing myself to just pack up and drive again when I heard the knock on the door.

It wasn’t a loud, frantic knock. It was slow. Rhythmic. Three soft taps, like whoever was on the other side wasn’t in any hurry.

My blood turned to ice.

I didn’t move. Maybe if I stayed perfectly still, whoever it was would think I wasn’t here and go away.

The knocking came again, louder this time.

“Come on, bud,” a familiar voice called from the other side of the door. “You’re not that dumb. Open the door, or I’ll let myself in.”

I froze. No. Fuck no. This wasn’t happening.

“I’m serious,” he continued, his tone light and sing-songy. “Don’t make me huff and puff and blow this whole shitty motel down.”

My hand moved on its own, reaching for the doorknob. Every rational part of my brain screamed at me to stop, to lock myself in the bathroom and call for help, but it was like I was on autopilot.

I opened the door.

And there he was, standing in the doorway like he’d just strolled in off the street. Same hoodie, same smirk, same faint glow in his eyes that sent every alarm in my body into overdrive.

“Morning, sunshine,” he said, stepping inside without waiting for an invitation. “Miss me?”

I couldn’t even respond. My throat was dry, my heart hammering so hard I thought it might explode.

“Aw, what’s the matter? Cat got your tongue?” He flopped onto the bed like he owned the place, propping his feet up on the nightstand. “Relax, dude. I’m not here to hurt you. Yet.”

“Wh-what do you want?” I finally managed to stammer, my voice barely above a whisper.

He sighed dramatically, like he was already bored with me. “You’ve got questions. I’ve got answers. Figured I’d give you a little show-and-tell so we’re on the same page.”

“A… show-and-tell?” I repeated, my brain struggling to process what the hell was happening.

“Yeah,” he said, grinning. “You know, to prove I’m not just some hallucination cooked up by your sad, overworked little brain. Which, by the way, I could totally be. Wouldn’t that be fun? Losing your mind before you hit forty?”

“Fuck you,” I muttered, my hands balling into fists.

“There he is!” he said, laughing. “There’s that spark I love. Alright, let’s get to it. Watch closely, because I’m only doing this once.”

He stood up and walked to the center of the room, cracking his neck like he was about to warm up for a workout.

And then he moved.

It was… impossible. One second he was standing in front of me, and the next he was across the room, leaning against the far wall like he’d been there the whole time. There was no sound, no blur of motion—just… nothing.

“What the fuck,” I whispered, stumbling back.

“Cool, right?” he said, grinning like a kid showing off a magic trick. “That’s just the warm-up. Check this out.”

Before I could say anything, his eyes began to glow. Not just faintly this time—they blazed, twin beams of red light that lit up the entire room.

And then he fired.

Twin streaks of burning red shot from his eyes, carving a smoking, jagged line across the far wall. The air filled with the acrid stench of scorched wood and drywall, and I nearly gagged.

“What the fuck! What the actual fuck!” I screamed, backing up until I hit the wall behind me.

“You like that?” he said, his smirk widening. “Pretty fucking cool, huh? I mean, yeah, it’s not super precise—I’m not carving any Mona Lisas here—but it gets the job done.”

I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. This wasn’t happening. This couldn’t be real.

“Oh, and don’t worry,” he added, waving a hand at the smoking wall. “I’m not gonna charge you for the damages. Motel’s got insurance, right?”

“What the fuck are you?” I finally shouted, my voice cracking.

“Good question!” he said, clapping his hands together. “See, that’s the fun part—I could tell you, but where’s the mystery in that? Just think of me as… better than you. Stronger, faster, smarter. Basically, everything you wish you were but aren’t.”

“You’re insane,” I said, my voice trembling.

“Probably,” he said with a shrug. “But hey, if you had powers like mine, you’d go a little nuts too. Now, be honest—how’s it feel? Knowing you’re completely and utterly fucked?”

I couldn’t answer. My mind was reeling, every nerve in my body screaming at me to run, but I knew it wouldn’t matter.

“Aw, don’t look so sad,” he said, leaning in close. His eyes were still glowing, casting an eerie red light across his smirking face. “You’re part of something bigger now. I’m your personal god, and you? You’re my favorite little toy.”

He straightened up, brushing imaginary dust off his hoodie. “Alright, that’s enough fun for one day. I’ll let you stew on this for a bit. Maybe next time we can play a real game.”

Before I could say anything, he was gone. Just… gone. One second he was there, and the next, the room was empty, save for the smoking wall and the lingering scent of burnt wood.

I collapsed onto the bed, my heart racing, my hands shaking.

This wasn’t real. It couldn’t be real. But the scorched wall said otherwise.

I stayed on that bed for what felt like hours, staring at the scorched line across the wall. The smell of burnt drywall still lingered, acrid and sharp, and yet… something about it felt off.

I mean, was it really burnt? I got up slowly, my legs still trembling, and walked over to the damage. The line was jagged, uneven, just like I’d seen. But when I ran my fingers over it, the surface felt cold. Not charred, not brittle, just… smooth.

I rubbed my fingers together, expecting soot or ash, but there was nothing.

“What the hell…” I muttered, stepping back.

Had I imagined it? No, no, I couldn’t have. I saw it happen. The beams from his eyes, the wall burning, the fucking heat that practically singed the air. That was real.

Wasn’t it?

I turned to the bed where the bat still lay in splinters. That was real. It had to be. I picked up one of the larger pieces and turned it over in my hand, feeling the jagged edge where it had snapped. The weight of it, the way the wood felt raw and splintered, was undeniable.

But the wall? It didn’t make sense.

I sat down again, running my hands through my hair as my thoughts spiraled. Maybe I was losing it. Maybe the stress had finally cracked me, and my brain was filling in the gaps with nightmares. That had to be it, right? Stress, fear, isolation—it was the perfect cocktail for a breakdown.

I laughed bitterly, shaking my head. “Get a grip, man. You’re just losing your shit. That’s all this is. You’ve been watching too many late-night horror movies and running on fumes.”

I glanced at the clock. It was noon, bright daylight outside. If this thing—if he—was real, why didn’t he ever show up in broad daylight? Why always at night, always in the fog, always when I was alone and vulnerable?

I started pacing the room, trying to reason it all out. The sonic boom I heard last night—maybe it wasn’t real. Maybe it was a truck backfiring or some other sound my panicked brain twisted into something else. And the glowing eyes? Well, there were explanations for that, too. Ever heard of sleep paralysis? Maybe I was dreaming with my eyes open.

The more I thought about it, the more it started to make sense.

I wasn’t haunted. I wasn’t being hunted by some glowing-eyed freak. I was just unraveling under the weight of my own shitty life.

“Jesus Christ,” I said to myself, letting out a shaky laugh. “You’re pathetic.”

It felt good, in a way—like I’d solved a puzzle. The pieces didn’t fit perfectly, but at least now I had a reason, an explanation that didn’t involve fucking laser eyes and super speed.

But then, as I was pacing, I caught movement out of the corner of my eye.

I turned to the window, my breath catching in my throat.

It was nothing. Just a tree swaying in the wind.

“See? You’re jumping at shadows now,” I muttered, shaking my head.

But when I turned back to the room, I froze.

There, sitting on the edge of the bed, was him.

“Oh, man,” he said, his voice laced with mockery. “Watching you try to rationalize all this? Fucking priceless.”

My stomach dropped, my mouth going dry.

“No… no, you’re not real,” I said, shaking my head.

“Oh, really?” he said, raising an eyebrow. He leaned forward, his grin sharp and cruel. “That’s what you’re going with? ‘Not real’? Buddy, I’m as real as that piss-stain on your boxers right now.”

I looked down instinctively—thankfully, no piss—but when I looked back up, he was gone.

“See?” I said, my voice shaky. “Not real. I’m imagining it.”

And then I heard his voice, right behind me.

“Sure, keep telling yourself that,” he whispered.

I spun around, but there was nothing there.

Nothing but the faint smell of burning wood lingering in the air.

Was it real? I don’t fucking know anymore. Maybe I am losing my mind. Or maybe he’s just that good.

The knocking didn’t come back. The days stretched on, and silence settled like a heavy blanket over everything. But it wasn’t comforting—it was suffocating. I told myself I should feel relieved. That maybe he was done with me, maybe he’d moved on.

But I didn’t feel relief. I felt dread. Because deep down, I knew he wasn’t gone. He was waiting.

That night, I was heading to the gas station down the road. I needed air, needed to do something normal to keep my mind from unraveling any further. The parking lot was almost empty, the buzzing neon sign flickering above the entrance.

As I stepped out of my car, I saw him again.

He was leaning casually against the building, arms crossed, that same mocking smirk plastered across his face. The glow in his eyes was dim, but it was unmistakable, like twin embers smoldering in the shadows.

“Hey, champ,” he called, his voice cutting through the still night air.

My stomach dropped. My instincts screamed at me to get back in the car, to drive as far as I could, but my feet wouldn’t move.

“I thought you might’ve missed me,” he said, pushing off the wall and strolling toward me, hands stuffed in his hoodie pockets.

“What… what do you want now?” I asked, my voice trembling.

He chuckled, tilting his head like he was sizing me up. “Oh, come on. I thought we were past the whole ‘why me’ thing. Let’s just say I’m here for… entertainment.”

Before I could respond, the gas station door swung open, and a guy walked out—a big guy, probably mid-thirties, wearing a leather jacket and looking pissed. He glanced at me briefly before muttering something under his breath and heading toward his truck.

“Perfect,” the man said, his smirk widening as he glanced at the guy. “You’re about to get a front-row seat.”

“To what?” I asked, dread twisting in my gut.

“To the show,” he said, his tone casual, like he was talking about the weather.

Before I could say anything, he was gone. One second, he was standing next to me, and the next, he was in front of the truck, standing directly in the guy’s path.

“Hey!” the driver shouted, slamming his door shut. “What the fuck are you doing?”

The man didn’t answer. He just stood there, staring at the guy with those glowing eyes, his hands still stuffed in his pockets.

The driver didn’t hesitate. He stormed forward, puffing out his chest like he was about to make an example out of him.

“Move, asshole, or I’ll make you move,” the driver growled, jabbing a finger in his chest.

I wanted to yell, to tell the guy to back off, but the words caught in my throat.

The man tilted his head, a lazy grin spreading across his face. “Make me, huh?” he said, his voice dripping with amusement. “Alright, big guy. Go ahead. Try.”

The driver didn’t wait. He swung a fist, aiming for the man’s face, but it never connected.

Before I could even process what happened, the man caught the guy’s fist mid-swing, his hand gripping it like a vice. The driver’s face twisted in confusion, then pain, as the man slowly squeezed.

“Come on, tough guy,” he said, his voice calm, almost bored. “This is your big moment. Don’t choke.”

I heard the sickening crunch of bones breaking, the sound sharp and wet in the still air. The driver screamed, dropping to his knees as the man finally let go, his fingers mangled and twisted like they’d been put through a blender.

“What the fuck—” the driver choked out, clutching his ruined hand.

“Shh,” the man said, crouching down to meet his eye. “Don’t ruin it. We’re just getting started.”

He stood up and grabbed the guy by the collar, lifting him off the ground with one hand like he weighed nothing. The driver kicked and struggled, but it was useless.

“Pay attention,” he said, glancing at me over his shoulder. “This is the part where it gets fun.”

Before I could move, before I could even think, his eyes lit up, blazing bright red.

“Wait!” I screamed, but it was too late.

Two beams of burning-hot light shot from his eyes, carving through the driver’s chest with terrifying precision. The sound was deafening, a high-pitched whine mixed with the crackle of flesh and bone being seared away.

The guy’s scream was cut short as the beams punched clean through him, leaving two smoking holes in his torso. He slumped to the ground, his body twitching once before going still.

The smell of burnt flesh hit me like a freight train, making me gag.

I stared at the man in horror, my legs trembling so badly I thought they might give out.

He turned back to me, the glow in his eyes dimming as he smiled. “Cool, right? I’ve been practicing.”

“What… what the fuck…” I whispered, unable to tear my eyes away from the smoldering corpse on the ground.

He stepped closer, his smirk widening as he leaned in. “I told you, didn’t I? I’m not like you. I’m not like anyone.”

“What are you?” I asked, my voice shaking.

He straightened up, brushing imaginary dust off his hoodie. “The name’s Lavoix,” he said, his tone light and almost cheerful. “But you can call me whatever you want. Monster works. God, if you’re feeling dramatic.”

I stared at him, my mind racing, my stomach churning with fear and disbelief.

“Anyway,” he said, stepping over the body like it was trash. “This was fun, but I gotta run. Don’t worry, though—we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other.”

He ran off faster than I could perceive.

I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the body, the smell of burnt flesh searing itself into my memory. I was horrified. I haven’t seen anything like this ever. Even gore in movies do not compete with this. I’m leaving out major details for your sake.

It’s been two weeks since that night. Two weeks since I watched him—Lavoix—turn a man into a fucking corpse right in front of me, like it was nothing. I haven’t slept. I barely eat. I don’t even leave my apartment anymore. Not that it feels safe here either; nothing feels safe anymore.

I can’t stop thinking about his face, that grin, the way his eyes burned like fire as he killed that man. And the worst part? He wasn’t angry. He wasn’t out of control. He did it like someone flipping a light switch—calm, deliberate, and completely unstoppable.

I’m writing this because I need someone to know. Someone has to know he’s out there. Maybe if I disappear, this will be a warning, proof that I didn’t just lose my mind. Or maybe I just need to feel like I’m not alone, like someone else might believe me.

He’s real. I don’t know what he is or where he came from, but he’s out there, and he’s watching. I can feel it. Every second of every day, I feel his eyes on me.

If you ever see him—if you ever see a skinny guy with a smirk too big for his face and eyes that glow like embers—run. Don’t try to talk to him. Don’t look back.

Just run.

Because I saw him.

And I wish I hadn’t.
