I didn’t plan on telling this here.

For a long time, I honestly thought it wasn’t worth digging this back up.

 The story only came back to me recently, while I was helping my parents move and… I saw our old computer. That alone was enough to bring back a lot of memories from my childhood—memories I used to think were normal, and that I can’t see the same way anymore.

My family had an old camera we used to record moments we thought were special, so we wouldn’t have to rely only on memory later on. Eventually, what started as an old photo camera turned into a video camera.

They recorded birthday parties, moments like surprising me with a new bike, or just silly things. Whenever storage started running low, my dad would transfer everything from the camera to his computer so he could keep recording.

When I was seven, my dad discovered YouTube, and realized he could upload the videos there to free up space on the computer. The account was under my name, since I was usually the focus. The profile picture was me, my mom, and my dad.

At first, no one really thought of it as “posting on the internet.” It was just a place to store videos without taking up space. My dad uploaded everything as-is, unedited, as raw as possible. It was only later that he learned he could add titles.

Sometimes relatives would come over, and my dad would play the videos on the computer for them. Everyone had a good laugh.

For a while, only my family watched those videos, and my aunts would leave comments like “auntie loves you,” “what a handsome boy,” or things like that.

Then a comment from a stranger appeared on one of the videos titled “day at the pool.” The person complimented my dinosaur swim briefs. I took it as a compliment and even thought it was funny that someone liked them.

But more and more comments from that same user started showing up on my videos. Before long, he had commented on almost all of them, leaving random things like:

“this kid is hilarious”

 “Happy birthday buddy”

 “wow, cool bicycle”

They became just as frequent as my aunts’ comments.

I did gymnastics, so for one of my competitions, my parents decided to film before it started. We were walking down the street, and they were asking if I was excited, if I thought I was going to win.

I… lost the competition.

It was my first time at something that big, and I didn’t know how to deal with losing. My parents tried to cheer me up. My coach said it was part of it. My friend Cameron stayed by my side the whole time, saying we could train harder next time. Still, I didn’t want to talk to anyone.

A few weeks later, my parents uploaded that video. The title was “before the big championship.” When I saw it, I got furious. I didn’t want to remember that day. I didn’t want it saved anywhere.

They said it was important. That the video showed the beginning. That someday, when I won a championship, I could come back to it and feel proud that I kept going.

But that user commented on that video too. Just a few hours after it was uploaded.

“Don’t be sad about losing, buddy. You were amazing.”

I read it more than once. My first reaction wasn’t fear—it was confusion. Then a sharp feeling I didn’t know how to name. I closed the page, but before that, I scrolled through the other comments to see if anyone else had noticed the same thing.

There were no other comments.

I trained gymnastics three times a week. The gym was inside a large sports complex, the kind where multiple groups trained at the same time. While we warmed up, parents sat in the bleachers talking among themselves or watching without really paying attention.

Behind the bleachers, there was a small room where we kept our things—backpacks, clothes, stuff like that. Just a door that was never locked.

Cameron and I often helped clean up after practice, and then we went together to grab our things. When I opened my backpack, something fell out.

A piece of candy.

I stared at the chocolate on the floor, confused, thinking maybe someone had packed the wrong bag. But when I checked inside, I saw a note.

“Don’t be sad when you mess up. It’s easy to tell you love what you do.
 P.S.: red looks good on you.”

I thought it was strange. I folded the note and put it back in my backpack. I slipped the candy into my pocket.

The red mentioned in the note was the color of the uniform—boys wore white with red details, girls wore white with blue ones.

Cameron joked about it.

“Looks like someone has a crush on you,” he said, blowing a kiss into the air.

That was enough to make my face heat up and my mind spiral.

“At least someone likes me, idiot,” I joked back.

I ate the candy on the way home. I figured that if it was someone from practice, throwing it away would’ve been rude.

When I got home, I dropped my backpack on my bedroom floor and went straight to wash my hands. My mom asked how practice went. I said it was normal. I didn’t mention the note—I knew she’d tell everyone about my supposed girlfriend.

Time flew by during winter break. Days started to blur together. Practice, home, practice again. My parents recorded less and less—they said I was getting too old to be in every video now, that only “important things” were worth recording. Before long, the channel went quiet. Sometimes I’d check the page and find it strange that there were no new comments from that user, but I brushed it off easily.

During the winter championship season, they recorded two more videos. One of them was from the trip to the city where the competitions would take place. I remember my parents and Cameron’s parents talking in the background while we tried to distract ourselves with simple tricks, laughing more out of nerves than joy.

That time stayed with me. I made it onto the podium—first place—and Cameron came in second. We had never been so happy. It felt like all the effort had finally paid off.

After the awards ceremony, while I was still holding the medal, unsure where at home I’d hang it, a girl approached me. She said she liked my movements. Before I could respond, she kissed my cheek and ran off into the crowd.

Rebecca.

I never forgot her name. One of the prettiest girls where I trained. And, at least at that moment, someone who seemed to like me.

But we didn’t get a good ending.

Not long after, I spent three long weeks on vacation with my grandparents in another city. When I came back, full of things I’d rehearsed saying, I found out Rebecca had quit training. I asked about her once or twice, pretending it was just curiosity, but I stopped when I realized no one really knew. I didn’t see Rebecca for a long time.

After the championship, everything felt mixed up. Things didn’t go back to their places. The event staff swapped backpacks around—boxes packed in a rush, people helping people.

At some point, we noticed the camera wasn’t where it was supposed to be. My dad mentioned it the way someone mentions a missing sock. He said maybe it ended up with someone else, or in a bag, or even in the car.

My mom agreed, saying we’d sort it out later.

We never did.

Cameron showed up at my house one afternoon, the kind where boredom set in and he trusted me to fix it. He was carrying his old Ninja Turtles backpack.

“Dude, you won’t believe what I found,” he said, barely stepping inside.

My mom shouted a quick “hi” from the kitchen. Cameron replied, asking if he could come in, even though he didn’t really need to. He dropped the backpack on my bedroom floor, sat on my bed, and started digging through it, visibly excited.

“Remember all that stuff we brought home after the winter championship?” he asked. “Like boxes, clothes, random junk that stayed at the gym?”

I nodded. After the competition, everyone moved on autopilot. Medals, hugs, photos. I barely remembered packing my things.

Cameron pulled something out of the backpack and placed it on the bed between us.

The camera.

The same old camera my family owned. Black, with a worn strap and a chipped corner on the left side. My stomach tightened slightly.

“It was at the bottom of a box that stayed at my house,” he said. “My mom thought it was another impulse buy from my dad. She said she was going to donate it, but when I saw it, I remembered you.”

I picked up the camera carefully, like it might break from the touch. I pressed the power button. The red light turned on.

“Holy shit. I thought my parents lost this,” I said. “They looked for it for weeks.”

“Then maybe… they didn’t lose it,” Cameron smiled. “Maybe in the rush, they just forgot.”

We sat side by side on the bed. I held the camera while we shared the small screen. We watched a few videos from the trip—us talking excitedly on the plane, then suddenly both of us asleep in our seats while our parents laughed. Another video showed the hotel hallway, me walking fast and urging my parents to hurry because I didn’t want to miss breakfast.

Then a video appeared.

The image started shaky and out of focus. Then it stabilized.

It was the gym.

The same angle I remembered from the bleachers: a wide view, the floor mat in the center, people passing in front of the lens. The sound was distant, muffled, like whoever was filming wasn’t trying to capture anything specific.

“Damn…” I murmured. “They filmed it.”

A smile crept onto my face. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to recognize details, but Cameron complained he couldn’t see anything.

“I don’t even remember this,” I said. “My parents must’ve forgotten they recorded it.”

“Yeah—”

The video continued until I stepped onto the mat. My heart sped up a little, even years later. The camera followed me from afar, zooming in and out.

“Dude,” Cameron said suddenly. “I might be wrong, but…”

“What?”

He pointed at the screen.

“I thought your parents sat over there.”

I looked where he pointed. The right-side bleachers.

“They did.”

“Then… why is whoever’s filming on the other side?”

I let out a small laugh.

“That’s weird. I don’t remember them sitting there.”

Cameron just hummed quietly.

He complained that it was impossible to see properly on such a small screen and asked if we could put it on the computer. I didn’t even think about it—I was completely absorbed in that recording. We went downstairs, turned on the computer, and connected the camera. I searched for the championship video.

“This one…” I started.

“Open it,” Cameron said.

I clicked.

Now we had a much bigger screen. When my name echoed through the gym speakers, I felt the same knot in my stomach from years ago. Watching competitions, even knowing the outcome, still made you nervous. There was a lot of static in the audio, but there was also a sound I couldn’t identify. It didn’t sound like wind or background noise.

It sounded like breathing.

I drifted for a while, flashes of memory from that day flooding back—the lights on my face, the tight uniform, the shaking as all those people watched. I only snapped back when Cameron complimented my handstand.

“Dude, you were amazing. But I was clearly better.”

We were glued to the screen.

“Man, this noise makes it impossible to hear anything,” Cameron said, more to himself than to me.

I nodded, distracted. In my head, I was still there, feeling the cold floor under my feet, counting the seconds to the next move. The camera suddenly jerked, swept across the gym, up to the bleachers, and back again. A rushed movement.

“Dude…” Cameron started.

“Since when does your dad hold the camera with his left hand?”

I didn’t answer. He was saying something, but I couldn’t hear him. All I could hear was the noise in my head—the cheers, the clapping. The breathing.

The camera zoomed in one last time, catching my run-up, and in the background, the bleachers. I was filmed moving from one side to the other. At one point, Cameron was visible too.

But that wasn’t what mattered.

I… paused the video. Rewound it a little.

Cameron turned toward me.

“You okay, man?”

I didn’t answer.

I leaned forward and raised my finger, touching the screen. I pointed to the back of the image, to two figures sitting side by side, almost swallowed by the low resolution.

They were my parents.
