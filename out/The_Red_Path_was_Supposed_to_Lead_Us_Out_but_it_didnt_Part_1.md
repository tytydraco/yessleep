I’d left the envelope on my desk for three days.

I shoved it under a stack of papers in my office, and tried telling myself to forget it. But I couldn’t.

Eventually, I took it home. I sat at my kitchen table with a cup of coffee, staring at the envelope until the light outside disappeared entirely. Then I finally opened it.

Just like [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/comments/1m4zhnw/theres_a_fungus_in_the_sea_that_doesnt_stay_there/); a single sentence printed on a thick card.

“You will report to Dock 9 at 0600 hours with no personal items.”

This time, I just smiled at the card – I was right. They aren’t done with me. They never will be.

I didn’t sleep much that night. When the alarm went off, it felt like I hadn’t even closed my eyes. Dock 9 was quiet except for the low groan of the water against the pylons and the sounds of loose chains swaying in the wind.

A single Order transport waited at the far end, with someone leaning against the rail, watching me approach.

“Dr. Iris?” He asked, voice low and scratchy.

I stopped a few steps away, my hands in my pockets.

“Who’s asking?”

He smirked faintly. “Rennick. They told me I’d have company this time.”

He didn’t offer me a handshake – he just stepped aside and gestured toward the boarding ramp.

The deck smelled like diesel and rust. Inside, the small cabin assigned to me and Rennick rattled with every wave. Two cups of coffee sat on a bolted down table in the middle of the room.

Rennick dropped into a chair, and took a slow sip.

“So,” he said, leaning back. “Do you know where they’re sending us?”

“Sample retrieval,” I replied, my voice monotonous. “That’s all I know.”

He let out a snort. “Yeah. Even Edward didn’t get to know more.”

I looked up. “Who’s Edward?”

He stared at his cup, slightly moving it with his fingers before answering. “Just an old friend. A good man who was always loyal to the Order. Stupidly so, I used to tell him.” Rennick met my gaze. “The Order said they needed him for one last job. His ‘retirement mission’. You don’t get to refuse it. And, turns out, you never come back from it.”

“What happened to him?” I asked, my voice soft and careful.

“Not sure. The letter he left me only said that he was being reactivated and to not believe any story they tell me.” Rennick let out a bitter laugh, looking back at his cup. “He was right – the cover story came next day. Apparently, he died on the boat after an unexpected storm. Him and the boatman both.”

I didn’t reply. I know the Order was capable of a lot of things – but to kill its own agents? In my mind, that seemed out of character. They’d rather use you until you’re dead.

The boat cut through the water. The fog thickened as we moved away from the docks, slowly making everything behind us disappear. Rennick kept mostly quiet, staring out at the endless blue ahead. Once, I caught him glancing at me like he wanted to tell me something else, but then decided not to.

The outline of a water treatment facility emerged from the fog an hour later. It was an uninhabited, brutal structure planted against the shoreline, its outer walls stained with moisture and mold. Even from the boat, I could smell the rust of this place. Really, it was that old.

The dock was manned by three Order security officers in full hazard gear, their faces hidden behind masks. None of them moved to help as we tied the boat down.

One of them stepped forward, and briefed us on our duties.

“You’ll be entering the inner section,” he said, handing us a blueprint of the place. “Your objective is retrieval only. No exploration is allowed outside of designated collection zones.”

“Infection?” Rennick asked.

The officer nodded. “Biological contamination. The Subject is responsive to movement and heat. We’ve been unable to clear it. Direct contact is prohibited and considered a death wish.”

I glanced at the building, dread finally catching up to me. “Why aren’t you sending in your own team?”

“Security reasons,” he answered, not meeting my eyes. “We can’t afford more casualties.”

Rennick gave a short, sarcastic chuckle and turned away. “Sure. But we can freely die, can’t we?”

They didn’t answer. Instead, the other two guards led us down a storage shed next to the facility. Inside, two sets of hazard suits waited for us on hooks, their helmets, although outdated, fitted with respirators.

The officers ordered us to suit up. “Anything that happens inside is your responsibility. We won’t come in after you.”

Rennick was the first to suit up – it looked like he got used to the motions of it. His suit bore a patch from an older Order division – it was faded and frayed at the edges. He caught me looking and smiled at me.

“Vintage,” he added. “Guess they figured I wouldn’t need a new one.”

I forced a smile back. What if Rennick was right? What if this really was our “retirement mission” – their excuse to get rid of us. I know a lot about the Order, and they know I do. Killing me in here would be easier than letting me keep breathing and risk me talking.

After putting my suit on, we followed the officers to the entrance.

“The central processing hall is straight ahead. Make sure to stay on marked paths. Red paint on the floor will lead you in and out.”

I tilted my head. “And if the paint’s gone?”

The officer refused to answer. He opened the door, and ordered the others to step back as we enter.

Inside, the light was dim and greenish, the paint on the walls completely gone except for a few edges. Although I was wearing a mask, the smell was strong enough – the smell of rot and death.

The red paint led us along a narrow walkway over a tank. The water inside wasn’t clear – it was  cloudy, like something just beneath the surface was waiting for us to turn our backs.

Rennick glanced down and muttered, “You still think this is a normal retrieval mission?”

Instead of answering, I gulped and continued moving forward.

We passed another tank, this one completely drained of water. Something had grown along the inner walls, clinging to it like moss but faintly pulsing.

Rennick stopped to look at it. “Seen that before?”

“Something resembling that in Madagascar.” A shiver ran down my spine. “And I didn’t want to be reminded of it. Let’s just finish this up.”

The red line on the floor began to vanish ahead, hidden under black stains and debris. We had to rely on the blueprint.

We found our way into the central processing hall. It was enormous, the far walls vanishing in the dark. Massive filtration tanks sat in rows, the tops of them covered with thick growths that twitched with each step.

The red line ended in the middle of the room, at a grated platform suspended over one of the tanks.

Rennick crouched, peering into the dark water below. “You hear that?”

I did. Beneath the constant drip of water, there was something moving inside the tank.

The surface bulged once.

Then, from the depths, something slim and rope-like surged upward, slamming against the grate with a heavy *thud*. Strands whipped between the bars, snapping and writhing, slick with some type of mucus. One lashed across our platform, missing my leg by inches before curling back into the water.

Rennick stumbled away, raising his collection pole like a spear. “I think it knows we’re here.”

“You think?” The tank water rippled violently, with several more tendrils bursting up – but now, they latched onto the railing, pulling themselves toward us.

“Move!” I shouted, grabbing Rennick’s arm.

Behind us, I heard more sounds of wet mass hitting metal coming from other tanks now – whatever this thing was, it wasn’t alone.

We started running. The sounds of our boots slamming against the metal was followed by the wet, slapping noises of the tendrils following us. The blueprint crumpled in Rennick’s hands as we tore through a section where the red paint reappeared on the floor.

Except – this wasn’t the same place.

“This isn’t where we came from,” Rennick gasped. The path ended abruptly, and we were met with a sealed maintenance door. The paint stopped there.

I snatched the blueprint from him, our time running short. “We’re supposed to be going south – this way turns us north.”

He grabbed the edge, pulling it closer to him. “The scale’s off. This isn’t… it’s not accurate.”

Before I could respond, the metal under us trembled. A tendril, this time thicker than my arm, whipped out from a crack in the wall and shot straight for us. Another followed, snapping so close to Rennick’s shoulder that it scraped his suit.

We bolted down the only open path – deeper into the facility.

We kicked through the maintenance door and latched it shut behind us. There was a window high on the wall, looking down toward the dock. Outside, we could hear the three officers speaking to each other – although we didn’t have much time to listen.

“--should be feeding by now.”

“Doesn’t matter. They won’t make it past--”

“Protocol says we wait for full assimilation before sealing the entry.”

My stomach dropped. Rennick froze, eyes locked on me. “You heard that?”

I nodded. “They’re not waiting for us to bring anything back.”

“They’re waiting for us to die here,” he replied flatly.

After a second, something slammed into the door behind us, bending it with its strength. A slick tendon pushed through the gap, slowly making its way inside.

Rennick yanked me toward the other side of the room. “Let’s go!”

But there was nowhere to go to. The room only had one exit – the door the infection was coming in from. I took a step back, my boots splashing into something wet and shallow.

Before I could look down, the metal door shielding us from the Subject gave way to the dozens of tendrils that came through it.

“This is…” Rennick muttered. “Where the fuck do we--”

Before he could finish, I spotted something – a hatch in the ground, half-submerged at the far corner, almost hidden by the water pooling around it. Although it wasn’t much, it gave me hope.

“There!” I shouted, shoving past him. I dropped to my knees, and used all of my strength to open the hatch. There wasn’t much time left – the tendrils were getting aggressive, slamming against the walls.

With a grunt, I finally managed to open the hatch, falling back from the momentum.

“Down?” Rennick whined. “You *sure?*”

“Not at all. Now *go.*”

We slid through the darkness, and landed waist deep in another channel of water. The stench here was even worse than before – which, in hindsight, is hard to imagine.

Rennick clicked on his shoulder light. The beam lit the place up – we were inside a tunnel, just barely tall enough to stand in, that led us deeper into the facility.

“South tunnel,” Rennick said, holding the soaked blueprint up so we both could see it. “If this thing’s even slightly accurate--”

“Horrible assumption,” I cut in.

“*If* this thing’s even slightly accurate,” he continued, now looking at me. “There should be an exit near here. Through the…” he took a big pause, eyes fixed ahead.

“Through what, Rennick?” I demanded.

“Through *that*,” he said quietly.

I turned.

In the beam of his light, the tunnel ahead narrowed into a choke point where something was draped across the walls. Some type of wet, quivering combination of flesh and tendon, pulsing in time with the water. The entire passage – no, the entire *section* – beyond it seemed alive. Like it was breathing.

And then it started moving towards [us](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThalassianOrder/).
