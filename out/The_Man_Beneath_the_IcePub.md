The first time our paths crossed, it was only for a moment. It was a drunken night of decadence and my mind was far more focused on the visiting Goddess from Sharm El-Sheikh whose sneezes made my heart flutter. I paid little attention to the old man smoking in the corner of the ice-bar.

In the fevered days to come, however, his infirm form wholly consumed me.

As I lay in my sickbed, terrified my life was to end at the ripe age of twenty — I could see him. Whether I was dreaming or residing in my aching, shivering body — I could see him. The torn lab coat, the cracked yellow skin, those piercing blue eyes — they stood vigil by my bed and haunted my dreams.

Mayhaps, those two weeks of sickness were a warning — a pistol shot from the universe urging me to keep my distance. Mayhaps. had I listened to my body, or even quit my job after my injury, I would be a far saner individual today.

But I did no such thing.

Once my sickness calmed, I retained my employment as a drunk and indulged the mystery of the old scientist. With blind fascination, I spit into the faces of the fates and pursued my interest in the mysterious patron. It is through my own folly that I became privy to the terrible tenor of dark science in which Dr. Zima forged his name.

 

 

It was back in the innocent year of 2012 that I met the man. After retreating from my studies of life sciences at the Charles’s University I further fled from responsibility and secured employ as a pub crawl guide.

My job, if one could call it that, revolved around the scores of intoxicated youths that would visit Prague through the summers. Each day, six days a week, I would provide the tourists with two hours of free liquor and then take them on an excursion of two overpriced bars and a club.

The bands I ran through the city would usually comprise of men, mainly young British boys to be exact — but every couple of nights an opportunity for romance would present itself. As it would happen, on that faithful eve, I was struck by Cupid’s drunken arrow.

She hailed from Sharm El-Sheikh and had a body which intoxicated on sight. Originally, she had been traveling Europe with her family but had heard many whispers that Prague is a city visited best alone. She had no interest in spending time in the decadent gothic capital in the company of her dotting mother and impatient father, but for my company she had quite the appetite.

It is not easy, however, to hold a conversation with a beautiful woman when a hundred strong horde stands at one’s back. Much of the pleasantries we shared were interrupted by dry heaves from the dark alleys and the screeches of concerned neighbors from high above. The Egyptian often disappeared back into the mass of drunken flesh for which I was responsible for, yet her melodic voice cut through all chants and jeers like a harp through television static.

It was also through her sneezes that I could locate the Goddess. With a soul worthy of marble, the high-pitched expulsions provided the gentlest suggestion of flaw in her perfection. The sneezes made her human. The sneezes only made me oh so more enthralled by her. 

The pub crawl would always finish at a multi-story club which was the Meccah of Prague’s tourist traps. On the nights I found myself too exhausted, I would retreat back home through the night buses to sleep. On most nights, I would find my favorite group of drunks and take them somewhere more amicable. On that night, however, I descended to the frigid ice-pub in the basement of the club.

I did whatever I could to transpose my love to another establishment, but she was far too taken by the concept of a bar made of ice. My Goddess relented the change to a quieter locale, yet she would only do so after cooling off in the tourist trap. Having never been to the ice-bar myself, I accepted her terms.

Even though I had shed my name-badge and simmered down my shepherd’s voice to a conversational volume, the drunken horde still recognized me as their leader. As I tried to talk to the Goddess in line for the ice-bar I was constantly interrupted by shoulder grabs and shouts and cheap shots I had no intention of sullying my throat with.

That night, much like many nights prior, the drunken horde disrupted my search for love. Yet it was not the drunken British children that were my undoing on that gelid eve. It is not they who sent me careening down the frozen hallways towards the edge of sanity.

It was the staff of that drunken tower of Babel that sealed my fate.

The ice-pub was popular, but small. The purveyors of the multi-story club were fully aware of the novelty a bar made of ice would provide in the blistering summer heat. They were also well versed in the foley of drunken crowds in a confined space. For this reason, the attendance of the ice-pub was limited to twenty drunks in ten-minute intervals.

Though the line, much like all lines comprised of the intoxicated, had little order — I could see at least forty persons stood before us. There was no rush. I considered myself safe in the presumption that me and my Goddess would spend twenty minutes waiting, then ten minutes shivering and then we would be on our merry way to warmer pastures.

Just as the door closed on the first batch of drunken adventurers, however, I was swept up in a change of plans. At the back of the first artic expedition stood two women from the isles of Britain. Though both were drunk, one was deemed to be too much of a vomit risk to grace the frozen floors. In one swift motion the bouncer liberated the woman of her ice-pub jacket and, when searching for a replacement, he picked me out of the crowd.

The bouncer and I had never spoken. He knew not a word of English or the local tongue. Though the towering man was not metropolitan in his tongue, he spoke fluently the only languages which his trade requires. With his mountainous stature and scarred face and poorly healed prison tattoos the man spoke the twin-tongues of violence and intimidation.

I put up the faintest bit of protest when he shoved my arms into the arctic coat, yet I did not allow my body to resist. The shores of the Vltava are filled with bloody faces that have made that mistake.

Just before the door behind me shut, I could hear the Goddess behind me sneeze. I did not take her sternutation as a sign from the universe that I should change my course. I took it as a sign that she would still be waiting for me when I left my frozen prison.

Even with twenty drunks, the ice-pub was far too crowded. The few ice-chairs available had melted past the point of furniture and served only as vague shapes to lean on. The frozen bar was staffed by two figures dressed in hazmat suits who lacked any capacity for quick motion. The drunks busied themselves touching the walls and suckling at the beer bong made of ice but I did my best to just focus on the large digital clock at the center of the pub.

Ten minutes and counting. I thought I could bare the time apart from my Goddess in relative peace but within the first two minutes of my frigid adventure a terrible noise bounced across the icy halls.

The second British woman, the one that didn’t seem like a vomit risk — she was screaming. She wanted to know where her friend was and, more importantly, she wanted out of the pub. I expected the staff to let her out, but instead they simply turned up the music to keep up a good mood.

She calmed down, for a couple minutes at least. Occasionally she would bang on the door and demand to be let out, yet for most of her stay at the ice-pub she sulked. When there were but two minutes left on the clock, however, her hectic energy returned.

In tones that couldn’t even be drowned out by early 2000s hits the woman started to scream again. When her calls for freedom yielded no results, she started to tear at the jacket she was given.

The clothing was tough, and clearly designed for more inhospitable corners of our globe — yet she was tougher. Just before the doors of the ice-pub opened, she ripped through the jacket. After she forced her way through the door all she left behind was a pile of thermal stuffing and fake broken nails.

My Goddess was in the next batch of people destined to enter the ice-pub so I did not bother exiting the frigid hall. Just before she entered, however, her phone rang and she ducked out. With a knowing glance, the towering bouncer shut the doors to the ice-pub once more.

Above me, the digital clock once again started to count down ten minutes. I tried, once more, to bear my cold and uncomfortable environs by keeping track of time. This time, however, there was something much more distracting in the pub than a screaming tourist.

Not far from the ice-bar there sat a small set of steps leading down to what I presumed to be some sort of a maintenance room. From that door, wearing a lab coat that would soon become very familiar to me, emerged an old, feeble man.

He seemed to have been summoned by the British woman’s outburst, for he seemed quite interested in the pile of stuffing she had left behind. Quickly, however, his attention changed. As the strange old scientist puffed away at his hand rolled cigarette, he kept his piercing blue eyes trained purely on me.

I am no stranger to offbeat old men hanging out in the back of pubs, I do work in Prague after all — yet there was something different about the man in the lab coat. With his sickly yellow skin and matted hair, the man looked horribly unwell — yet it was his stare that truly sent discomfort crawling up my spine.

I was not in the mood to make merry with drunken strangers, but I desperately needed distraction from the old man in the lab coat. Even though I was fully aware of the deluge of orally transmitted diseases that travel through the underbelly of our gothic capital, I pressed my mouth against the frozen beer bong at the center of the ice-pub and indulged the tainted liquor in hopes of finding forgetfulness.

I drank at least a dozen watered down vodka shots and someone threw in a beer that even despite the ice managed to be lukewarm. My experience at the end of the frozen teat was not a pleasant one, yet when I reemerged, the strange old man was gone. The clock had also made progress.

When the door to the ice-pub opened for the third time, my Egyptian Goddess finally entered. She was much more enthused by the frozen environs than I was, yet after three or four minutes, she too grew unimpressed. The jacket she was given was the same one the British woman had torn apart not twenty minutes prior. The ripped-up clothes provided little warmth to my love’s tender flesh.

My first visit to the ice-pub was of no trifle for my body. The second visit gently challenged my immune system. It was not until the third time the clock rolled back its ten-minute mandate that I found my lungs aching. The cold was getting to me, but the steadily strengthening sneezes of my Egyptian Goddess made my heart ache.

In misguided chivalry, I switched jackets with her. In drunken folly, I sealed my fate.

We shared our first kiss in that frozen bar and then we shared a few more in the nearby Spider Lounge. That, I recall. The rest of the night, however, has been stolen away by the skull-rattling fever that followed. I have faint memories of being loaded into a taxi by some of the Bohemian-types that hang around the lounge but sickness has wiped away all detail.

I awoke the next morning consumed by agony and drenched in sweat. The lifestyle of a pub crawl worker is not a healthy one, and I had fallen sick many times prior — yet it was never as horrid as my condition was then.

For two weeks I existed in a constant state of fever and coughs. Whatever disease my body had contracted was a cruel one. My roommates, children, just as I, were of little help in my time of sickness. I was brought a solitary cup of tepid ramen when my condition proved to be too frail to walk to the kitchen but I was left in isolation otherwise.

As I writhed in my sickbed my chest ached with a burning suffering and my mind was seized by terrible apparitions. Most of the phantasms were the ethereal visions of a man who’s soul is seized by fever, yet within all the horrors my brain projected there was one constant — the old scientist.

He stood by my bed when I was lucid. He traveled with me through the fetid vapors of my dreams. The old scientist never made any attempts to speak to me or interact in any other fashion. He simply watched me from a distance with his piercing blue eyes.

After two weeks of the cursed sickness, I was far from healed. As decrepit as my lodgings were, however, they did not come for free. I needed to pay rent.

On my first day back at work I felt far from healthy. My chest ached, the veins in my hands were bloated and my mind existed beneath a thick layer of mental fog. Luckily, my job at the pub crawl did not require me to be particularly sharp.

At that point, I had taken my visions of the old scientists as being a product of my fever. I was unsure if the scientist had even existed to begin with and I made no effort to check. When I first put on my name badge, I was convinced that I would never enter the ice-pub again. By the end of the night, however, I was in deep need of cooling down.

It had been a historically hot day. Even with the sun down, I was sweating as one would at midday. Initially, I thought that some fresh air and libations would do my sickly body well, yet they did not. By the time my horde had reached the five-story club my body felt patently unwell. Briefly, I considered calling myself an ambulance but, foolishly, I chose to cool my body in the ice-pub.

The cool environs of the frozen bar felt like they could calm the burning discomfort brewing in my abdomen, but they did not. Moments after I found myself back at the ice-bar my hearing and sight started to fade. I tried to lean on one of the frozen chairs, but they were far too melted to hold up my weight.

 

The first thing I saw were his sharp blue eyes. The next, was the burning ember of his cigarette. I was lying on a metal slab in a room filled with vials and beakers and microscopes. When my unfamiliar environs fully dawned upon me, I panicked. In distress, I shoved the old man away and readied myself for a speedy escape. My push had propelled the frail scientist backwards, yet my body would not travel. Exhausted, I collapsed back onto the metal slab.

‘Disoriented, dehydrated, signs of jaundice, potential inflammation of the joints. Heavy alcohol consumption, poor sleep diet, possible drugs. Not good. Not good.’ Though my push sent the scientist falling against the shelves of tinctures and vials, he quickly regained his footing. ‘Very young. Very unhealthy. If poor behavior is kept up, precious life will be wasted. Not good. Not good.’

The man spoke with a rapidity and gentleness unbecoming of his appearance. Briefly, he turned away from me to pick out an improvised package of a foul-smelling balm. With his piercing eyes once again burning into my skull, he handed me the medicine.

‘Apply this to your hands and neck. Effects are not instant, but quick. Should relax the heart and restore energy.’

Perhaps, it was the light-headedness that still seized my mind. Perhaps, it was the ethereal blue of his eyes. Perhaps, I am simply an idiot. Either way, without much argument, I scooped a healthy helping of the gray ointment and applied it to my knuckles.

Though the scientist said otherwise, the relief was instant. Within moments the ache in my fist soothed and the veins in my hands receded to normalcy. Putting even a small helping of the balm on my neck relieved my discomfort even further.

Though I introduced myself to the scientist by my full name, he never gave me his. He simply identified himself as John, the ex-assistant of the once great Cryobiologist Otakar Zima. Doctor Zima had died many years prior, but John had taken it upon himself to continue his mentor’s studies.

The gelid tenor of science Zima practiced was shunned by all modern scientific organizations and required interminable sub-zero temperatures. With little funding available, the old scientist negotiated a laboratory beneath Prague’s infamous ice-pub.

As the old man spoke, I could see the staccato of his words hang in the air in quick puffs of mist. The vials and tinctures that occupied much of his makeshift laboratory were coated in a thin layer of frost. The temperature in the room was undeniably beneath the point of freezing, yet in my shorts and t-shirt I wasn’t the least bit cold.

When I remarked upon the incongruent climate, the old scientist laughed. ‘You know little of the cold. You know so little that you might as well know nothing at all,’ he said, in another torrent of little puffs. ‘Big pity Doctor Zima lectured before the digital age. Very big pity. If you could see a single lecture, you would ask very different questions.’

The old scientist seemed to be getting ready to educate me on the concept of cold, yet I quickly excused myself. Even though my aches and pains left my body with the help of John’s strange balm, the memory of my enflamed lungs still burnt bright in my chest. Fearing a return of the sickness which kept me bedridden for so long, I fled the frozen laboratory and emerged in the back of the ice-bar.

That night, I slept soundly. The question of the strange old man, however, did not leave my mind. By the end of my next shift, I found myself standing in the long winding line to enter the ice-pub once more. When I knocked on the metal door that led down to the makeshift laboratory the kitted-out bartenders paid me no mind. When the door finally opened, the feeble scientist greeted me as if I were an old friend.

I had abandoned all my interest in the sciences when I had fled the university, but talking to the strange man reminded me of my past passions. When he spoke of Doctor Zima’s research John’s words burned with an irresistible academic zeal. He saw Zima as a true visionary who’s brain could steer humanity from the brink of disaster. If Zima’s theories could be put into practice and the true potential of the cold could be unlocked, John claimed, the world would be ushered into a new frozen golden age of prosperity and peace.

John’s passion for cryobiology was unmatched and so were his theories. He spoke of the cold not as a simple thermic reality but a force beyond the comprehension of man. He spoke of peaks and valleys within the scale of heat, hidden corners in our primitive measurements that could unlock biological properties which modern science couldn’t comprehend. The old scientist spoke of freezing temperatures not as a state of matter but rather as a separate world from ours.

I, for the most part, did not put too much stock in John’s opinions. It was their fantastical nature that interested me, not their real-world application or accuracy. Briefly, I made an attempt to learn more about Otakar Zima, yet John seemed to be much more content talking about the man’s studies rather than the facts of his life. When I tried to figure out when he died, or at least where the doctor had lectured — John immediately descended into abstractions.

‘When I met Doctor Zima, he was very old. Old like me. I was young. Just like you,’ he said to me one night as I visited. ‘Charles’ University. The university you so smartly fled. He lectured there. But it was a different time. It was a different regime.’

I never took it upon myself to ask John’s age, it seemed impolite to do so. I simply presumed he was talking about the communist government.

I spent much of my evenings that summer in the company of the old scientist. He would regale me with the tales and theories of Doctor Zima and, on the occasions where I arrived bearing certain work-related injuries, John would provide me with his various magical tinctures and balms to ease my aches. I enjoyed my time with the old scientist, yet as the tourist season came to an end and my nightly bacchanalia morphed into an ever-repeating shift of babysitting drunks — I found the pub-crawl badge to be a burden.

Around November of 2012 I left the pub-crawl and made a transition to a more sober aspect of the tourism industry — the tour guiding world. Although I traded my name badge for an umbrella and my morning hangovers for a bigger paycheck, I would still drop by to visit the old scientist whenever I found myself around the ice-pub in the middle of the night. I still thoroughly enjoyed the conversations about how life could be preserved and extended through the aid of the cold, yet the drowsiness my midnight visits imbued in my morning tours proved to be far too much of a bother.

Month by month I started to visit John’s frozen laboratory less and less. As seasons changed to years, I stopped thinking about the strange man and his theories all together. It wasn’t until this summer, more than a decade later after I had first met the scientist, that I thought of him again.

 

Even though the old man had stopped being a part of my day, I would still walk by the ice-pub on my way to work every morning. The passage in which the establishment is located is one of the many clogged arteries of the Prague tourist trade which becomes utterly impassable at noon when the crowds climb out of their hotels. In the early morning, when all the pilgrims sleep, the passage usually smells of last night’s urine and other misadventures.

That fateful morning, the passage carried only the stench of ammonia.

Moments after I registered the smell, I could see its origin. The door to the ice-pub had been pried open. The whole passage was slick with water. The ice-pub had been vandalized and it was melting.

Though I had an early shift to get to, I abandoned all responsibility and ventured into the once-frozen hall. The misshapen suggestions of chairs had turned into flimsy icicles. The massive frozen beer-bong was now a puddle. The large timer that sat above the ice-pub was hanging by just a few wires.

With his yellowed skin and fading hair, John had never looked like a prime example of health. The state I found him in, however, was unrecognizable. The man was sitting in a pool of melted ice on the floor, shivering in madness. All the sharpness had left his words and his eyes were dull and glassy. With slurred speech John said something about a group of drunk tourists breaking in around sunrise, but the longer he spoke the less structures his sentences possessed.

The old man clearly needed help, but he turned nigh feral when I tried calling an ambulance. With fury in his wavering voice, he labeled all modern doctors to be criminals and charlatans. With what little energy he had left, he delivered one final lucid instruction.

‘Ice,’ he rasped. ‘Bring me ice. Bring me ice before I perish.’

Prague is a city that is yet to become fully comfortable with the concept of air-conditioning. Ice is a commodity not easily acquired in the street. After a sprinting search through the winding streets and some frantic research on my phone, all I was able to cool off the old scientist with was a couple dozen popsicles that I managed to buy from a Vietnamese corner store.

My old friend was in dire straits, yet it was also heavy tourist season. There was no way that I could miss work. I promised John that I would contact someone from the ice-pub management and get them to summon a repair crew to bring the laboratory back to its frigid normalcy. Though he looked like he could no longer understand my words, I promised I would come to check on him during my lunch break.

It took me much of my walk to work to finally get someone from management on the line. Even then, they were not particularly interested in what was going on with their establishment. Yes, someone broke into the ice-pub in the early morning hours — they were aware. Yes, a repair was scheduled at some point in the future. When the repair was to take place, however, was none of my business.

I spent much of my three-hour morning tour thinking about the old scientist. I had little understanding of what was wrong with him, but our evening talks made it clear that he needed the cold to stay healthy. As I rushed back to the ice-pub during my lunch break, I readied myself to find him in a worse condition. My imagination, however, could not prepare me for what I found.

He was melting. The tight yellow skin of his face had flaked off like reptilian scales and revealed a soft pink undercover. He was still in deep delirium and he still begged for more ice. Yet, between his fevered demands for ice, old John had another message:

‘My work. On top of the shelf by the door. My work. My life’s work. Save it. Publish it. Make sure the knowledge does not die with me.’

I, once again, insisted I call an ambulance. He, once again, denied any medical assistance.

With my next tour starting in but fifteen short minutes, I relented to the old scientist’s demands. His visage, however, did not leave my mind’s eye. Just after I started the tour, I excused myself from the crowd and placed a quick call to Prague’s emergency services. I told them of John and his medical dilemma. The voice on the other end of the line, much like most of the governmental representation in Prague, was far from friendly. They did, however, after much begging from my side, promise to visit John and call me back with an update.

The update came almost an hour after my initial call. I was given an angry tongue lashing by the voice on the other side of the line for making a prank phone call. Apparently, they found no old scientist in the basement of the ice-pub. Apparently, misuse of emergency lines was a crime and I was lucky I was not being prosecuted.

I did not argue with the voice on the line. They did not seem open to discussion and, more importantly, I had a crowd of forty tourists waiting for me to talk about the fourteenth century. Instead, I quickened the pace of my tour and rushed back to the ice-pub the moment it finished.

The old scientist was, indeed, gone. All that remained of him was a foul-smelling puddle and his clothes. The idea that the old man had melted out of existence disturbed me greatly, yet that biological mystery was quickly replaced by another.

As instructed, I retrieved the old scientist’s papers from the top shelf. I made an effort to read through them, but the handwriting and jargon were far too foreign for me to comprehend. The research in which the old scientist partook was confusing, but what truly broke me — what sent me to the brink of madness and forced me to burn all the papers which the frail man had left me behind — was the stack of identification papers.

Much of the documentation was ancient and written in German, yet inside the pile I found a photograph ID from the turn of the century. It was a passport issued by the first Czechoslovakian Republic, not two years after the end of the war.

Although over a hundred years old, the photograph was undeniably of the old scientist who I had spent so many nights with. Born in 1882 into an empire that no longer existed, he looked no older or younger than when I had met him.

His name, as the papers claimed, was [Otakar Zima](https://www.reddit.com/r/MJLPresents/).
