I wasn’t supposed to be out there alone.

That’s what the training officer told me, anyway, when he handed me a laminated packet labeled TEMPORARY LOOKOUT—DRY SEASON PROTOCOL and slapped my shoulder like I’d just volunteered for something heroic. The Smokies were seeing their driest July in over a decade. Creeks pulled their ribs close and went quiet. Leaves crisped at the edges. Even the rocks felt warm to the touch if you sat with them past noon. We’d had two lightning-sparked spot fires already, both killed quick by crews who humped hose up trail with that zero-complaint look that comes from doing it too long.

“Cammerer’s yours,” he said. “Two weeks straight. You’ll do fine.”

You hike to the Mount Cammerer lookout from Cosby—Low Gap up to the A.T. and along Cammerer Ridge, a bright-boned path laid on thin soil, then a spur trail out to the stone octagon the CCC laid in the late thirties. The old guys like to talk about it: how they hauled sand by mule and water by hand; how the stones don’t fit so much as interlock; how the windows look east like eyelids; how when it storms the place feels like a ship in a gray bottle. There’s a USGS brass cap set in the rock a few yards south of the porch, scratched with boot heels and weather, stamped with the elevation—4928—sharp enough to catch a glint at noon. On the climb I passed the battered “Low Gap 2.9” placard—the one with the little bullet crease in the top-right corner that everyone pretends not to notice.

I met my relief at the Cosby Campground ranger shed at dawn. He smelled like canvas and woodsmoke and somebody else’s camp coffee. We checked the radio—dispatch, repeaters, tone codes—loaded up a plastic tub with freeze-dried meals and those two-gallon water bladders you lash together like you’re building a raft. I had a rolled tent, even though the lookout has bunks. The training packet highlighted this: IN CASE OF WINDOW FAILURE, USE TENT. In parentheses: (BIRDS). Someone had drawn a smiley face with devil horns next to it.

“Birds,” my relief said. He looked past me toward the far line of trees, where the light comes late. “That’s what they write when they don’t want to write ‘wind throws logs.’ You’ll be fine.”

I want to say I believed him. I want to say I wasn’t already hearing things in the trees—those soft positional sounds your brain assigns when you know you’ll be alone later: a stepping sound you can count, a caught breath that isn’t yours. But I was new. I was the extra body squeezed into a season with too few. So I said thanks, took the tub’s rope handles in both hands, and went up.

The climb to Low Gap is three notches of work. Sweat stung my eyes and carried pine on its back. Every switchback came with a cicada that cranked a winch, then fell silent like a hand over its mouth. When I hit the ridge the wind had teeth again. Clouds pulled skeins across Mt. Sterling to the east. The trail burned bright with sun where the hemlocks had died, white snags pointing their regrets at the hot sky. I passed two southbound AT hikers who lifted two fingers without slowing. Their calves were the color of black tea. The lead one had a small bell on his hip that chimed with a joke of gentleness.

At Cammerer, the stone lookout sat quiet and solid above the ridge, the way it always does. I shouldered in, propped the door with the boot wedge, and said a dumb hello to the empty. When you first walk into a lookout, there’s always that pause where your brain expects someone to answer back—some other ranger leaning on the Osborne Fire Finder, a coffee mug with lip marks, a map bristling with pins. This one had the Finder centered, the glass cleaned so thoroughly you almost doubted it, the azimuth ring catching light. There was a composition book on the desk with a pencil stabbed through its spiral. A page lay open:

June 28 – Clear. Smoke report false alarm (fog). Bear on ridge at dusk. He knows where you are before you know where he is.

July 3 – Lightning hit above Groundhog Creek. Crew knocked it down. Remember to hang your food stupidly high. We got a smart raccoon with opposable thumbs.

July 9 – Heard the old stories again. The thing they like to call Wildman. A joke until the laughing gets quiet.

Below that, the page was torn.

I set my food under the bunk, hung my clothes from the rafters on a line (taut-line hitch… no, is it taught—no, taut-line, right, whatever, I tied it twice), and put my spoon with the cook kit before I could lose it. Afternoon laid its length across the blue folds of ridges while I ran my radio checks: “Cammerer to Cosby, test one” and “Cammerer to Foothills repeater, test two,” that clunk and hiss that sounds like a wave hitting a dock. It comforted me. Like pressing down on a bruise and feeling the hurt obey.

And then I was in it. A job that is mostly watching. You walk the deck. You look at the edges of things. You learn to distinguish woodsmoke from fog, heat haze from a true column. Your eyes make circles and the world you are responsible for lives and breathes in rings around you. Some people can’t stand it. The quiet becomes audience. Every bird is judged. Every creak is a promise you don’t think can be kept. Me, I’ve always liked the sense that if something goes wrong, I’m the first to say it out loud. I like being counted on.

The first night, something tapped the western windows three times, slow, like knuckles on a table. I was lying on the bunk with the radio low, listening to Cosby check in with a trail crew scheduled to sleep at campsite 37. The tapping came with a smell I couldn’t place at first—a wet-feral breath that caught on the back of my tongue like ammonia and pennies. I sat up. The tapping stopped. I watched the window like it could blink.

“Bird,” I told myself after a minute. “Big dumb grouse.”

But I hadn’t seen a grouse at 4928 in July.

I stepped to the window and shined my headlamp. The beam bounced back old glass and the reflection of my own forehead sweat. Beyond that, the decking planks and the stone guard wall and the scrub of mountain laurel. And beyond that, the helter-shelter black of forest that understands all your shapes and wants nothing from them at all.

I wrote the smell down in the log.

There’s a story in the Smokies you hear if you hang around the old radio guys and the sawyers. It changes with the teller. Some use a whisper. Some use a laugh and never look you all the way in the eye when they do. It’s a leftover from before anybody put numbers on hills, before anybody nailed an oak blaze to a trunk and told that tree where the path goes. Hair and hands and a face like a man’s except worse in some small way no one can name the same. Red eyes, some say. Yellow, say others. A sound like a barn door unpinning itself in a storm. It is the Tennessee Wildman and he doesn’t belong to one county or one holler; he belongs to the moment you realize you can’t tell if a step is two-legged or four and your heart makes a hollow in your chest to hide in.

The second day I watched heat blur a creek valley until the laurel looked like it was seething. Dragonflies wrote bad words in the air and erased them again. I rotated the Osborne’s reticle along the ring, practiced: “Column at 110°, one ridge beyond Snake Den.” (I wrote 100 in the log the first time and scratched it out; nerves make liars out of numbers.) It wasn’t true, but it felt like rehearsal against the day it would be. Around noon I heard rocks knock together below me. Not the slide of one stone riding down a slope to rest against others. A clack, then space, then a second clack that echoed up my collar. I leaned over the east deck rail and held out my breath until it trembled. Whatever made the sound had patience. It waited until my eyes watered and my elbows hurt and my brain began to tell me a story about nothing being wrong.

Clack. Clack. Clack.

I didn’t say “Who’s there” because I am not stupid and because the words wouldn’t have been for whoever made that sound. They would have been for me.

When it stopped, the quiet that replaced it had weight. You know that quiet. It pulls on you like a thing with hands.

I scanned the slope—black birch, dead hemlock anniversaries, the scrollwork of the trail where it curls around sandstone. Twice I had that old mischief of sight where you think a gray trunk turns its head. Three times I imagined dark hair where there was shadow. And once—just once—the shape of a shoulder sliding behind laurel as if it didn’t mind being seen enough to hurry.

I wrote that down too.

The third day, I found the spoors.

Down past the porch, where the stone meets soil, something had pressed the dirt into an idea of a foot. If I were telling this to you at a bar instead of writing it into a report I’ve edited twenty times, I’d cup my hands and say it like this: splayed, wide, with the impression of a big toe that might not be a toe so much as a blunt wedge. The heel didn’t end where I expected it to. It bled imperceptibly into the rest of the ground like weight does when it’s careful. And there were more prints than one. One aimed toward the porch and stopped short of the stone. One moved along the edge and turned away.

You learn quickly what a bear looks like when it puts its front feet down and then its hind feet into the same holes. You learn the signature of a deer’s careful twist. This was neither. It was almost a person except that my body rejected the idea and I felt that small speed of sweat find the small of my back and sit there, unsure what to do next.

I took a photo with my phone and the glass made the dirt disobedient. It looked like nothing. I pressed my own boot alongside for scale. The print outpaced me by length and width. You’d need to be a linebacker with a history of turning over your ankles to make it.

Back in the lookout, the composition book waited. I flipped to a fresh page and wrote slowly:

July 12 – Possible tracks below the east deck. Not bear. Not cat. Not human (or not sober). Stone knocking at midday. Smell last night (ammonia/metal). I know the stories. I am not drunk.

I almost added: And I am not trying to make friends in my own head, but the pencil looked dumb with that sentence and the words felt too hard.

That evening, Cosby radioed in a smoke report from a day hiker near Maddron Bald—called in as “a high, thin column, not moving” and most likely someone’s hot grill. Dispatch asked me to take a look. I stepped to the Finder and spun the ring to the caller’s bearing, then rotated back toward where the column would be if it were real. My finger walked the topo, ridge to ridge. There, faint as a breath over a bottle mouth—just the lightest tint in the air. If you’ve never done it, you don’t know how your brain tries to excite itself into seeing smoke when there’s only heat. But after a minute, the tint held steady. Narrow. True. I radioed: “Cammerer to Cosby—possible column due north-northeast, about eight miles, one ridge past Snake Den, narrow, white. Could be moisture.”

“Copy Cammerer. We’ll ping Greenbrier.”

“Copy,” I said. I almost mentioned the rock clacks. I did not.

While I watched the column, something moved in the foreground. It was nothing, then something, then nothing again. A shape in the shape of a man, half the slope closer than I wanted. It stood exactly as still as a person does when they know they will be seen if they rock forward. If a deer freezes, your eye reads it like a piece of grammar in the sentence of the wood. If a person freezes, the wood becomes stage. This fixed itself right at the border of those two ideas and refused to belong to either. I felt my throat remember how to close and I said, without touching the radio, “You’re too close to a federal structure,” and the shape—if it had a head—turned it.

There are distances in these mountains that have a moral to them. The space between you and a rattlesnake, for example, where the animal will be what it is and you will not change that simply by wanting. The space between you and a thing like this was not one of those. It wore motives.

By the time I found the cheap bravado to lift my binoculars, it was gone. Only the laurel held the thought of its passage—those leaves that bounce once and then, with great care, bounce again.

The radio hissed: “Greenbrier confirms column near brush pile on private land. Abated. Good eyes, Cammerer.”

I said thank you and felt like a man doing ventriloquism with a full glass of water.

That night, the stones came. Not pebbles. Stones. Some big enough to sound like they had stories in them. They hit the stone guard wall below the deck and sang with that ignoble note only struck objects can manage. One skittered across the deck plank and impacted the door with a thunk that shook the bolt. I turned off my light and stood with my hand on the radio as if it were a friend’s shoulder. Outside, the wind didn’t move. Cicadas quit.

If I had stayed still, I think it might have ended differently. If I had simply been a piece of furniture in the lookout’s memory, a man-shaped shadow that breathed within limits and chose to honor those limits like a good guest, maybe the thing would have tired. The thought would have evaporated and I would be writing about the time kids got frisky on a ridge.

But something in me—something that remembers being a boy in the dark woods with a stick you have decided is a sword—picked up the flashlight. It clicked in my hand and threw a cone of weak yellow at the windows. I stepped to the door.

“Don’t,” I whispered to myself.

I opened it anyway.

The smell made me step back against the table. I could taste it in my eyes. There’s a stink the hog farms put up sometimes when the wind drives their belly toward town; there’s a stink when the creek pulls back in August and leaves what it was carrying. This was both and something sharper—like a jar left uncapped for years in a shed.

The deck lay empty, then not. It’s a trick of old light. Your brain pulls the slow photograph in and says there’s nothing, and then it adjusts and something is there after all: a forearm against stone, a trailing hand, hair matted with leaf-chaff, arm-length wrong and muscular in ways that misname themselves in the eye. The hand—okay, it was a hand, there is no other word that has fingers—curled against the stone rail. Toenails—not claws—clicking once as weight transferred. It moved without hurry and with purpose, and it looked, which is harder to describe than it sounds. There is looked-at and then there is looked-into. I say it looked into because I could feel the idea of myself ten paces behind me where my spine meets something that isn’t bone and it seemed to examine that instead of the meat I haul around to move it from place to place.

“Hey,” I said, failing both of us.

It withdrew the hand and gave me a sound that didn’t carry. No grunt. No scream. More like a breath refusing to be born. The odor lifted and fell like an animal settling.

I moved backward and closed the door slow, like you do with a sleeping child.

I slept in the tent inside the lookout that night, the fly rattling against itself, the radio on my chest. Around two, something walked the roof. One step. Two. Three. Slow, as if mono-footed. I held my breath until the tent swam and thought of the note in the packet: (BIRDS). I tried to laugh. I let out a sound like a cough that someone had set down and forgotten where. The steps stopped. The wind came back like a promise not worth much. And I slept the way the body sleeps when it chooses you, a drop into something that has no temperature.

On the sixth day I made a mistake. It was small as mistakes go. It’s the scale that matters.

I hiked down the spur trail to the A.T. to check the sign where some over-eager weekenders like to carve hearts. I brought the tub’s empty water bladders to refill at a seep we use when the mule train’s late. It’s a brown trickle this time of year, tucked under rhododendron and a boulder with a face like a dead man’s cheek. You lay the bladders flat and you aim the trickle with a plastic bottle you’ve cut in half and tell yourself you aren’t wasting an hour.

I found the bladders moved when I came back up. Just a little. The kind of little you could write off if you were in town at a picnic and a gust came and you were telling a story you wanted to keep telling. But up there, where every mouthful of water is an act of faith and planning, you pay attention.

Then I saw the line.

It ran from the deck, across the bare spot where visitors stand to take pictures, and down the start of the spur trail. It wasn’t rope. It was bark. Someone—something—had stripped long skins from a poplar and braided them loosely, the way old men braid string when they explain knots to boys who aren’t listening. The braid was hung in a lazy drape from laurel stems and pinned at intervals with sticks placed like picks for a guitar you do not know how to play. It formed a waist-high guide that split the air and tugged your eye along it, like a sentence your mind starts finishing without permission.

I followed it ten paces before I understood what I was doing.

“No,” I said out loud to a day without clouds. “No, sir.”

I cut the braid with my pocket knife and coiled it meanly and tossed it off the slope. The forest took it with a shrug.

Back inside, my spoon was gone.

I stared at the spot on the desk where I’d left it, the cook kit lid reflecting my face back at me like a bad idea. It was just a spoon. Steel with a bend in the neck from some previous life. It was also the one piece of comfort I had been careful enough to control. I searched the obvious places, then the dumb ones, then the places that made me mad at myself for even thinking of them. Nothing. I ate dinner with a tent stake, washed the stake in a guilty way, and put it next to the cook kit where the spoon had been, as if that could undo the part where I’d been played with.

That evening, I heard a man speak below the deck.

I couldn’t make out words. I couldn’t tell if it was English or another thing entirely. It rose and fell like a human voice rises and falls when it tells a story to itself to see how it sounds. I pressed my ear to the floorboards and felt the vibration come through bone: not deep, not growled. Thin. An idea of a voice. I waited for the shape of a sentence to present itself and when it didn’t, when the cadence stuttered and found itself again and repeated a rise that felt memorized rather than understood, the kind of fear I associate with hospitals and sirens came to sit cross-legged behind my heart and put its hand in my chest cavity and wriggle its fingers around until I could taste brass.

The voice stopped. The breath on the other side of the deck board did not.

I did not sleep that night. I sat at the Finder and traced azimuths with the dead radio in my lap—dead because the battery had died and my spare had been left in the tub and the tub was set just outside the door and I could not open the door without doing something to myself I do not have a word for.

There are things a person can do to prove to themselves they are still the owner of their body. You can clap. You can sing. You can slap the side of your own face. You can put your hand on your own sternum and push until you cough. I did none of these. I watched the ring spin under my finger and thought, absurdly, of how many men had laid hands on this glass circle before me, eyes narrowed against smoke, hearts beating with weather instead of whatever this was.

At first light I opened the door.

The tub was upright. The rope handle had been re-tied. It was a knot I recognized because it was a knot I tie when I am in a hurry and think I will fix it later and then never do. It wasn’t mine. It was mine badly attempted. Two turns instead of three. The difference had the taste of mockery.

Down the slope, halfway into the laurel, hung the spoon.

It had been threaded through the bark braid I’d cut and thrown and it hung like a charm, a little sun laughing to itself when the wind found it. I had the thought, sharp and single, that if I stepped down there to get it, the laurel would close and the smell would open and I would be in a different part of the story. I stayed where I was and let the spoon hang and felt like I had been asked a question I had failed even before I tried to answer.

I made my call for relief at noon. It wasn’t supposed to happen for another four days. There is a rhythm to these things and you don’t break it unless the break buys you something you can defend later. I used the professional voice. I kept my nouns clean.

“Cammerer to Cosby.”

“Go ahead, Cammerer.”

“Requesting early relief.” A small pause. “Medical?” I could hear the pen dispatch was already holding.

“Fatigue,” I said. “Hydration.” Another lie prepared itself, lined up behind that one, and I didn’t have to pull it because the pen noise changed.

“Copy. We’ll send C.R.E.W. to the trailhead, ETA 1600. Your relief is Waller.”

Waller had a scar through his eyebrow that made him look like someone you shouldn’t borrow from. He laughed like an old pot. He was superstitious in the way only a man who’s been right about more than he can prove will be. I breathed out and felt my chest respond like a crate that’s been untied.

“Copy, Cosby. I’ll meet Waller at the spur sign.”

The thing below the lookout, the thing that could tie a knot if you gave it time and watched, made its first mistake then. Or maybe it didn’t and all of this is a drawn-out moment that began a long time ago with someone else’s name and I am only now catching up to it.

It stepped out.

Broad-chested the way a swimmer is, hair a color that doesn’t exist in a paint catalog because it keeps changing with the angle you look at it—gray, then rust, then a color the hungry sun makes when it burns through smoke. It stood between the porch and the start of the spur and it watched me with a face that was not a face only because I didn’t want it to be. It had a brow and a jaw and those were both wrong in small, exact ways that made my brain keep correcting, then stopping, then trying again. The eyes were dark as sugar water. The structures around them twitched as if they were learning.

There’s a moment they don’t tell you about in the packet. A moment where your mouth wants to shape the word “sir” and your hands want to bring themselves up to show emptiness and your legs want to fold. The animal in you shakes the keys it stole from all the buildings you keep locked inside. Something else in you checks the list of laws you know and starts crossing things off with a red pencil because none of this is going to help.

I lifted my hands.

“Okay,” I said. “I see you.”

The Wildman—if that is what it was and there are not better words and worse ones, just this one—tilted its head like a man pretending to be a dog for a child. The movement was rehearsed. It took a step. The print it left was as careful as a child’s assignment in penmanship. It made a sound like a whisper being chewed. It raised its right hand and opened it—showing me a palm crosshatched with old scars and new—and it laughed once, a bark that never found its own echo.

The radio breathed. “Cosby to Cammerer—Waller on the way, he’s bringing extra water for you.”

The head turned toward the radio as if the words had a smell.

I felt a stupidity then that I have replayed so many times my skull has divots in it where the replay wheels ride. I felt protective. Of the radio, of the Finder, of the stone itself and all those men in the thirties who placed these rocks like sentences you want to say correctly forever. I stepped forward and the Wildman flowed back a half-step and the relationship between us shifted from two points on a map to a line with tension in it.

One more step and I would be off the porch. One more after that and I would be on the dirt. One more after that and I would be in the story you tell only if you have nothing left to keep.

The Wildman made a sound then that lives under all other sounds I will hear until I die. It wasn’t volume. It wasn’t even threat. It was a correction. It told me, without words and with perfect clarity, that I had mistaken who was moving who.

I stopped.

The head turned again, slow, tasting the air for Waller maybe, or for the idea of Waller, or for the different flavor of a man who has seen enough he has stopped pretending he hasn’t.

I went back inside. I closed the door. I sat on the floor with my back to the wood and my hands on my knees like a child told to breathe. Outside, the Wildman walked the deck. The boards talked softly under its weight. It paused at the windows, each in turn, as if the lookout were a museum it had paid to enter and it would not be cheated. At the north window it leaned close enough that I could hear its breath find the old caulking and turn it sweet and rotten. At the east window it put something—forehead?—softly to the glass and rested it there for the count of five.

When the sound of it moved to the door, I put my hand flat against the wood and felt heat like a stove through winter gloves. It stood there a long minute, and then it did something that took parts of me I did not know you could take. It knocked. Three times. Slow. A rhythm I knew from the first night and which now changed permanently from question to certainty. Then it stepped away, and when it did, I heard stones clack once, twice, three times, slow, and something in the sound said wait.

I waited.

Waller called up the spur at 4:17 p.m. My watch said so. His voice carried like an easy promise. “Ho! Cammerer! You up?”

“Yes,” I said, and the word cracked in the middle like an egg.

He came up with a grin and two red jugs and a look that said I was not the first man to look like this. He set the jugs down, let out a breath through his nose, and turned his head in that birdish way he has.

“You smell that?” he said.

I said yes.

He walked the deck slow. He bent once to look at the stone wall, then again to look at the print I hadn’t known I had kept pristine. He ran a thumb along the window sash where something had left a fine brown smear that you could call sap if you wanted an easy afternoon.

“How long,” he said.

“Days,” I said.

He nodded as if he had just put down a heavy bucket. He walked to the Finder and laid his palm gently on the glass ring. The touch was not superstitious exactly; it was respect shaped by years.

“We’re leaving on time,” he said. “We won’t do it in a hurry and we won’t do it slow.” He smiled without mirth. “And we won’t look back unless we have to.”

He stepped to the door and then—God bless him—he opened it with the same easy motion he always uses, as if nothing in the world has changed because if it has you don’t want to tell it that.

We went down the spur and the Wildman came with us.

Not on the trail. Not in any way that would make a straightforward story. It stayed in the trees on the downhill side and it moved parallel, a shade for each of us, its progress marked not by itself but by what the forest did in its wake: a slow bounce of laurel leaves, a bird lifting and refusing to call, a dry rattle of something that might be bones strung on bark if you believed you were going to die and needed the world to be dramatic about it. Twice I made the mistake of trying to place it exactly and twice Waller touched my shoulder, that tap-tap a coach uses—don’t reach for the ball when you should be moving your feet.

At the A.T. junction he stopped and looked at the sign like it might say something new if he looked kindly enough. Then he turned downhill toward Low Gap with a cheerfulness he did not feel and I followed, and the Wildman, who does not care about signs except the ones it makes, went with us.

When we reached the first switchback cut into the slope where the bench is wide enough for three men to walk abreast, we heard rocks move in the gully below. Not tumble—place. A cairn made with care. Waller did not look. He said, instead, a sentence that I have thought a lot about since and which has nothing in it except what it says:

“We’re not the first to go down while something comes along.”

He meant in history. He meant in afternoons. He meant in the lives you live in your head when the body is busy.

At the last hundred yards before Low Gap, where you begin to hear human voices again—children’s complaint and a dog’s scold and the slap of someone’s palm on a truck bed—the smell lifted, as if a line had been crossed. The hill behind us held its breath and then let it out, and with it went a pressure I hadn’t known was riding my sinuses. My body did the thing it does after a fever breaks: it discovered thirst with an anger that was almost joy.

At the truck, Waller slung the water into the bed and handed me a bottle.

“Don’t tell them,” he said, nodding toward the campground, meaning the families and the men in their hats who say “sir” to us with a practiced drawl. “Tell me. Tell the radio. Tell the book. That way it’s true without being useful to folks who will only want the part where it has teeth.”

I told him. In fewer words than this. In the truck while the air conditioner made a sound like the old bluegill pond at my grandfather’s place when you tossed feed and the fish all rose at once, greedy and flat. We drove to the shed. He signed me out. He said I’d done fine. He meant it. He walked me to my car because he knows about doors and how they feel after you’ve been looked at through one.

At home, days later, I unpacked slow. The world had edges again. The shower made the good sound when it hits the back of your neck and you put your hand against the tile and remember that you used to believe in walls. I emptied the plastic tub onto my kitchen table. The tub’s rope handles still wore that two-turn knot. The tent stake was in there too; it still smelled faintly like scorched ramen water from the night I played it off as a spoon.

When I reached the cook kit, I found my spoon.

It had fused to the bottom of the pot. I must have kicked it into the fire my first night—no, my second?—and fished it out and set it down and planned to scrub it proper and then forgot like boys forget to write their grandmothers and then convinced myself it had been taken to make the story better. The steel had gone dull and blued and then welded itself to the thin aluminum like a silver leaf pressed to a cheap coin. I held it in the light and laughed once and felt tears rise and then I laughed again because that was the correct response, ridiculous as it was.

On the back of the composition book—because I’d brought it home without asking and Waller would have rolled his eyes and said “just bring it back next run”—I wrote this, because the brain likes to have forms and I am no different:

July 21 – Relief complete. Possible Wildman encounter. Rock knocks, smell, tracks, vocalization mimicry (?), structure, deck contact, window contact. Visual at twenty-seven meters, daylight, no precip. The object demonstrated curiosity, patience, a sense of… rehearsal. No overt aggression unless you call being rearranged aggression. Which I do.

It was nearly midnight when I finished. I turned off the kitchen light and went to my small bedroom and lay on sheets that smelled like the detergent aisle at the store where the checker says “you take care now” in a way that makes you believe her. The street outside my window had one working lamp and it painted a single blade of brightness across my closet door. I counted my breaths to thirteen and back down, something an old SAR guy taught me when the questions won’t stop asking.

At 1:13 a.m., my phone buzzed.

I didn’t pick it up. No good thing calls at 1:13. It buzzed again at 1:14—a little longer, like a friend trying to decide if they should insist. I let it go. In the morning I listened to the voicemails. The first was static with words in it if you’re the kind of person who finds faces in wood grain. The second was a breathe-talking sound—the intake that precedes speech and never finds it.

The third was stones. Three clacks. Slow. I could have deleted it. Instead I saved it and I have listened to it enough now that I can tell myself I hear laurel leaves move after the second clack and that is either true or it is a mercy I give myself.

I went back, because that is what the job asks and because some part of me that is older than I am didn’t want to finish in the middle of a sentence. The second hitch was rain-slick and tamer. The air smelled washed. Cammerer felt like a ship in a bottle again. I set my things down. I straightened the Finder. I checked the deck for prints and for the line of bark that might be strung to lead me where I shouldn’t go and for the smell that now divides my life into before and after. Nothing.

In the notebook, Waller had left a note in his half-print:

July 27 – Fog thick as milk. Saw nothing, heard less. You’re okay up here. He knows your name now. (Don’t let that sentence trick you.) – W

That night, I slept in the bunk and not in the tent. Rain ticked the glass windows in the rhythm of a clock that never has to be wound. The wind came up at two and I woke and lay with my hands crossed over my chest like a boy at church. I listened. I waited for a step, a breath, a clack.

What I got was silence broken once by a whip-poor-will and the long sigh of a tree deciding to give up on a limb it had been pretending wasn’t dead. I went back to sleep with a smile I did not own.

In the morning, on the east deck, pinned under a small rock with care, lay my spoon. Separated from the pot. Clean. A bend in its neck where it had always had a bend, testimony to the fact of itself. It caught the sun and flashed the way metal does when it means to tell you it can still choose who to give your face back to. I stood there with the rain gutters chiming and the smell of wet stone and the old fall of leaves in a world that had discovered law again.

I put the spoon inside the cook kit and closed the lid and set it on the table. I put my hand on the Finder. I breathed. I did my job.

Sometimes, after, late at night in my apartment, there’s a sound at the edge of hearing—a roll of something small across something big, an insect caught in a sill, a neighbor’s late plate set onto a counter with care. It is nothing. It is not a message. It is the world being itself while I am myself inside it. But sometimes, not often, just enough, I will put the phone to my ear and play those three clacks in the dark and I will think about the way the bark braid pulled at the air, insisting my eye follow, and I will hold the knowledge that I did not follow the way you hold a rail in a stairwell after nearly falling. And then I will sleep.

He is out there still. Male or not—“he” is simply a convenience. A word with a handle. He is out there when the stones warm and cool, when the laurel drops its old leaves, when the CCC’s careful work ínterlocks damp in a fog so thick you can chew it. He is not a bear. He is not a man. He is something that wants you to know it could be both in the places the map is thin.

And when the ridge burns again—and it will, because the sky believes in matches—he will stand where smoke makes the same column as a lie and he will watch. He will wait. And if you knock, he will answer. Three times. Slow. With patience it took him the long way to earn.
