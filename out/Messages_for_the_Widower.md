They say that loss is always harder when you least expect it. I won’t say that’s a lie, but it’s not the complete truth either.

My wife died six days ago, leaving me to raise our only son, Joshua.

A tumor took her. An evil, ravenously hungry growth of tissue that we didn’t discover until it was too late.

I was by her side for every bit of the ordeal that I could be, giving coworkers shifts, using paid time off, sick days, all that.

And it still wasn’t enough.

I’d also pick up our son from school so he could come and see her too. It was a hard time for all of us.

Then, not even a year into her treatment, we received the news.

“Terminal.”

By the time it was announced that Paige had few days to live, she had been physically reduced to a husk of her former self.

As I held her hand, I thought of how unfair it was. How unfair it was that she not only had to experience the degradation of her brain, but her body too.

She had lost nearly half her weight and a small gust of wind could take her, but she was holding it together the best she could.

I was not.

“It’s not fair.” I told her, trying my best to hide the fact that I was close to breaking down. “You’re already suffering enough inside. Why? Why is it doing this to you?”

She couldn’t talk very well at this point, but I could understand her.

“*I—I know it’s not fair. I feel the same way as you. But there’s nothing we can do a—a—about it. Ah, jeez, it’s a bit—hard to—talk. But—yes, it isn’t fair. But, also—you can’t change it. Yes—I’ll be gone, but—you will still be here—you’ll be here for Joshua, and I’ll be watching over—you two. A—and, I’ve got one last thing for you, but that’s going—to have to wait.”*

“It’ll be hard without you. It’ll be so damn hard.”

“*I—I know. Come here.*”

As we embraced, I could feel her bony frame shifting.

“*Not too much longer now. I can feel myself fading.*”

“No.” I said. “Don’t go, please.”

She locked eyes with me and said that last words I’d ever hear from her alive.

“*I’ve no choice. You will take care of Joshua. O—okay? Please, it’s my last wish. I—I love you, Harry, you and Joshua. I love you, and—and, everything is going to be okay.*”

And like that, the love of my life faded away in my arms.

It’s a strange feeling, really. I didn’t start crying or anything like, not right away at least. I was mostly numb, if anything. My wife had just died in my arms and I didn’t think I was in reality.

And then I felt like a monster. Joshua hadn’t been here for this, but maybe it was better that way. I couldn’t make him watch his own mother die.

I did end up calling the school, eventually.

“Yes? Who’s this calling?”

“Harry Scott, Joshua’s father. I—I’m taking him out of school for the rest of today… and the next few days.”

When I picked Joshua up, he was curious as to why.

“Is it mom?”

I felt that lump in my throat. I had to hold it together. If not for myself, then for him. I suppressed it and responded.

“Y—yeah, I—son, I love you very much, I’m not sure how to tell you this. But—it’s just going to be me and you from now on.”

He looked up at me, worried.

“What? Did mom go somewhere?”

"She, she's gone."

I had to focus on the road, but pulling over was an inevitability.

By the time I had pulled into a store parking lot, Joshua was audibly sobbing. I got out of the car and went over to the passenger side door.

“Josh, hey, come here.”

He opened the door and exited the car before falling into my arms, his sobs now semi-screams of sadness.

“W—why?!” He asked through sniffles. “Why did she have to be taken away?”

“I—it’s n—I’m sorry, son. There wasn’t anything we could do about it. If there was, then I’d have spent all the money in the world on it.”

“It’s not fair.”

I had told that to the people in my life way too much. So, instead of telling him the “well we just have to deal with it” bullshit, I let him vent.

“You’re right, it isn’t fair. It isn’t fair at all. But we still have each other, and mom is going to be watching over us. In one way or another.”

He stopped sniffling and looked up at me, his face wet and red from the sobbing fit.

“C—can we do something fun tonight?”

“Yeah, yeah we can.”

We gorged ourselves on pizza, soda, candy and fried our brains with video games and movies that night. I didn’t feel too hot myself, but I could tell it was taking Joshua’s mind off his mother, and that made me feel better than any food or entertainment could.

It wasn’t until 2 in the morning that I passed out. Joshua had been asleep in his room for hours, but I stayed up. I couldn’t sleep, so I double dosed on Valium.

I had brought my wife’s phone home from the hospital. Since it wasn’t a crime scene or anything like that, I could keep it. I’d deal with the rest of her stuff later.

It was charging on her bedside table when I received a message.

Thinking it was work calling because I had forgotten to call out, I groggily picked up the phone and nearly had a heart attack.

*ONE MESSAGE-*

*FROM: Paige <3*

I couldn’t believe my eyes. My wife was dead, but right here was a message from her phone. I didn’t care about the logistics, as it was a voice message, so I listened to it.

This one also came with an actual text attachment.

“Listen to this one yourself.”

So, I did.

“*Hey, honey, how’re you holdin’ up? I’m sorry about what happened, and I’m sure you miss me but hopefully it makes you feel better to know that I miss you too. You and Joshua, God… best thing I ever did was have Joshua with you. You two have kept me, and are keeping me going through this. I know it isn’t much, but in the event that it takes me, you’ll have these to listen to.*

*So, did you go to work today? If you did, cool! If not, then that’s fine too, I wouldn’t expect you to be ready to do so considering what just happened. I’m not up to much myself, ha-ha! Sorry, sensitive subject. Anyways, is Joshua doing good? Of course he is, you’re a good dad after all!*

*Ah, nuts. Looks like I’m outta time for this, well, I hope things get better, bye!”*

And that was it, the message ended.

I had to sit there for a second. My wife had just spoken to me, but how? I didn’t want to check her phone, that felt a bit weird.

Still, the message was wonderful, and it made my day a little better considering the circumstances.

The day simply went on, but I couldn’t stop thinking about the message. I knew my wife wasn’t alive, but it felt so good to hear her voice; to hear her healthy and able to talk.

I wanted more of it, so I sat around waiting all day for another message to come.

It didn’t end up happening, not until a day later.

On the second day after her death, I received another one.

“Get Joshua and listen to this one.”

I got him and explained what was happening.

“*Hey, good morning, you two. You guys holding up okay? I could be doing better right now but sometimes you just have to go with the flow.*

*Harry, I asked you already how you were doing. So, Joshua? How are things on your end. You doing school right now or did dad take you out because of… you know… sorry, it’s hard not to bring up.*

*Anyways, I hope you two are doing good. Well, as good as the situation will allow, anyways.*

*Oh man, why do these things have to be so short? Ah, sorry, bye!”*

Joshua looked up at me, beaming.

“That—that was mom! Oh man, I was really missing her. But, isn’t she?”

“Yeah, still. But I think there’s some way these messages are coming through. Anyways, I’m not complaining, I’m overjoyed to hear her voice again.”

“Yeah, me too!”

Josh and I went bowling with my brother that afternoon, so we were able to catch up and talk about what was happening.

“I’m—I’m sorry about what happened, man.”

“Oh, with Paige? Yeah, it’s been—well, I won’t lie to you Anthony, it’s been really *fucking* hard. I’m trying to keep it together for Joshua, ha, hell, sometimes I think he’s handling it better than I am.”

“Well man, I’d say the fact that you’re out doing this at all means you’re doin’ pretty good. I’m proud of you, brother.”

I had to turn away from him for a moment.

“Oh? What’s up.”

“Trying not to let you see me cry, man. That shit’s embarrassing.”

The rest of bowling went well. Joshua won, actually. I suppose he used all that pent-up anger to win.

Nothing of note happened for the rest of the night.

Three days after Paige’s death, I received a third message.

“*This one’s gonna be a little shorter, but, oh well.*

*I hope you and Josh are holding up okay. Did you talk to Tony yet? He’s always been your biggest supporter next to me, so if you haven’t, please do! If not for your sake, then mine! I might be dead, but I still care about you. I’m trying to think of a joke to tell but I can’t cut it.*

*I guess just hearing my voice is enough for you, huh? Well, I can understand that.*

*Well, I’ve gotta go now, but I hope you have a good rest of your day!”*

Well, one thing was true; I did enjoy hearing her voice, and it was making it that much easier to cope with her absence.

Joshua and I played some games and I made our favorite for dinner.

As we sat at the table eating, Josh asked me a question.

“Do you miss mom?”

I looked at him.

“Huh? Yeah, of course I miss her, she was my wife, my best friend, my companion. I know you don’t have anyone like that yet, but the loss of something like that… it isn’t something you get over easily.”

“I like Jenny from my science class!”

“Oh. Guess you do have someone like that. Wait, why didn’t you tell me sooner!?”

The conversation trailed off and the night ended with Josh and I passed out on the couch watching cartoon reruns.

Four days after Paige’s death, I received the next message, this one asking that Joshua be there with me.

“*Harry, you can listen but this one’s for Josh.*

*Joshua, how’re you doing? I can’t exactly see what’s happening but I’m sure you’re going as good as you can. Right? Now I know you’ve never really talked about this stuff, but are there any girls at school you like? You can say whatever you want, but I’m not going to be able to experience this with you. Still, I hope that whoever you find makes you happy. Happy like your father made me.*

*You’re likely taking time off from school and that’s okay. Everyone will be nice to you when you get back, and I just want you to know something; I am so proud of the person you’re becoming. From the moment you were born, I knew that you’d do great things. And I’m sure you will.*

*It’s just a shame I won’t be around to sing your praises, but, when the day is clear and the skies are blue, look up, and I’ll be looking right back.*

*I love you, Joshua, and I’ll always be looking over you. Make your father proud.”*

Even though the message wasn’t directed at me, I was still feeling emotional from it. I looked over at Joshua and I could see his eyes brimming with tears.

“She said she was proud of me. Mom is proud of me, dad.”

“Yeah. And I am too, you’re stronger than I am. It sucks that this is happening, but you’re keeping me together, Joshua. And nothing in the world could stop that.”

He wrapped his arms around me, and I could feel his sobs slowly regress.

“I love you, dad.”

“I love you too, Josh.”

I called Tony later that night. I always told him about these things, and this time around was no different.

“Hey, Tony. Things are getting better.”

“Oh? Love to hear it brother. How’s Josh doing?”

“Well, after today’s most recent voice message, he’s holding his head a lot higher.”

“That’s great, if you don’t mind me asking, what did it say?”

“I’ll spare you the details, but she just told Josh how proud she was of him. He loved it.”

“That’s good.”

“Kid’s stronger than I am, Tony.”

“How so?”

“Because he’s managing to hold me together when I want to fall apart. I don’t even have the strength to keep that going. He’s the glue holding me together.”

“I’m here too if you need anything, I’m your brother and I’ll always be there to help you.”

“Thanks, Tony. That means the world to me.”

“Any time little brother, I love you, you know that, right?”

“I do. I love you too brother.”

And that was it.

I went to sleep that night feeling just a bit better. Maybe things were improving.

Maybe all I needed was time.

Maybe all I needed was the comfort of knowing that, even in death, my wife was still there, talking to me and telling me everything was going to be alright.

Five days after Paige’s death, I got the last message I’d ever receive from her.

It came with two texts this time. I’ll show the first one now.

“This is for you. Joshua can’t hear it.”

And so, the voice message began.

“*Harry. The last one was for Joshua but… there’s so much I want to say to you.*

*Do you remember when we first met? That day at the café? You spilled your coffee all over my jeans. I remember it vividly. You were all panicked and trying to help me. You even offered to buy me a new pair of pants afterwards.*

*Of course, I accepted the offer. I saw something in you that day; a future. I don’t know what you considered to be our first, but I’ll always view that short little trip to target for a new pair of pants as our first date.*

*You were awkward, bumbling, and probably thought ‘there’s no way this’ll work out!’ Well, I’ll tell you now that there wasn’t a second during that outing where I wasn’t completely enamored with you.*

*You, of course, thought you were way too weird for me. Hell, I even had to forcibly put my number in your phone afterwards, but I believe it was obvious at that point.*

*I’ll say, you sure became a lot more confident after I gave you my number. It was like a switch flipped, baby!*

*One date turned into multiple, multiple outings turned into actual dating. Do you remember our first kiss? Because I do.*

*It was magical.*

*You had taken me out to my favorite restaurant in town. At that point, I knew I had fallen hard for you, but the gestures you made and the efforts you went through to impress me?*

*I didn’t just fall for you; I fell completely in love with you.*

*Just before we walked out of the restaurant to continue the rest of our night, you turned to me. Do you remember what you said? Because I do. I’ll remind you one last time.*

*You said ‘I’m not sure how to do this, so I think I’ll just do it. Do—do you mind if I kiss you?’*

*I didn’t mind then; I don’t mind now.*

*And should we meet in our next lives, I’ll never mind it.*

*Of course, one thing led to another and we ended up at your apartment. I’ll spare you the details, I’m sure you remember how it went.*

*But, much like our first kiss, it was an intimate, emotional experience. I’d never done something like that before, let alone do it with another person.*

*I’m not sure if you remember what I said afterwards, but I’ll tell you once again.*

*‘Thanks—for being my first.’*

*And from that moment on, we were stuck together like two strips of tape.*

*I’ll never forget when you asked me to marry you, either. It wasn’t this grand, cheesy moment, but a reserved, emotional one.*

*You got down on one knee, I could tell you were nervous, but you had a plan.*

*You pulled out a ring and you told me, similarly to how you first asked if you could kiss me, ‘I’m not so sure how to do this, so I’ll ask you straight-out. Would you mind if I married you?’*

*You could have proposed to me in the middle of a gas station bathroom and I’d have said yes. I’d never met anyone like you and I was so madly in love with you that I was afraid you might be uncomfortable, but you loved me back in kind.*

*You know the rest.*

*We got married, had our honeymoon in Italy and all that. Lovely stuff, really.*

*And then I announced the news to you; we were having a baby boy.*

*I still remember how you reacted. You were like a little kid getting a video game for Christmas, jumping up and down while hooting and hollering.*

*I could’ve given you happiness through a million dollars that day and the joy you received from the thought of being a father still would’ve outweighed it.*

*I knew you were going to be a good dad.*

*And you were.*

*And you still are.*

*I’m starting to sound like a broken record here, but do you remember what I’d always tell you when something bad happened?*

*Right, I’d tell you that everything was going to be okay.*

*Everything is going to be okay. You just need to keep going and with time, you won’t view me as a means to be sad, but something to be proud of.*

*You and Joshua will have given me something good to leave behind when I die. And through him, you’ll still have a part of me; something beautiful that you can live for.*

*This message has to end soon, so I’m leaving you with one final thing.*

*Stay strong for Joshua; you’re the only parent he has left. It isn’t just you, though. Joshua needs to stay strong for a grieving father, so keep his head up and raise ‘im good for me.*

*For you to grieve me, shows me that you did nothing but love me.*

*And I loved you too, Harry. I loved you from the moment I met you, I loved you after our first date, our first time, getting married, having Joshua.*

*I loved you through it all and I love you still. So, even in death, my love for you will stand, unwavering.*

*You don’t have to move on from me and you don’t have to forget me, but if you think of me, I only ask that it be the parts of me that make you happy, not sad.*

*Whenever you feel sad, just think of your good memories with me, think about our times with Joshua and remind yourself; everything is going to be okay.*

*I love you, don’t ever forget that.”*

And that was it, the last message I ever received from my wife. I wasn’t sure if the logistics, seeing as how there was nobody to send them.

But I’d like to think that, through some otherworldly force, she was able to get them out and tell me how much she loved us.

I took the advice and cleaned myself up. I had to start being a better father to Joshua; after all, I was the only one he had.

——————————————————————————————

Three weeks following Paige’s death, we cleared the house, tailored it to our liking and prepped for her funeral.

It’s weird living without a third person in the house. I mean, the loss of a companion is one thing, but Joshua and I had essentially lost our third wheel. However, with time, we’d learn how to ride without it.

The day of the funeral came.

Shortly before we left, Tony called me.

“You doing alright, brother?”

“Yeah, I’m doing better. Thanks for helping me and Josh get back on our feet. I owe you the world.”

“Nah, I was just helping out someone in need. If you can raise Joshua without it all going to hell, that’ll be enough for me.”

Son of a bitch, that’s why I loved him.

“Thanks, man. I don’t know what I did to deserve being your brother.”

“You were born after I was.”

“I love you, man. See you at the funeral.”

“Love you too brother, see you soon.”

Joshua and I managed to find a spot in the parking lot of the church the funeral was being held at. We both got out of the car at the same time.

We lined up in front of the church doors and stood for a moment.

“Everyone’s in there waiting for us.” Joshua said, tugging at his sleeves.

“Yeah. Let’s not keep them too lon—.”

“Are you sad? About today? About having to accept that she’s gone?”

I got down on one knee and held both his shoulders in my hands.

“Joshua. Of course I’m sad about this. It’s my wife’s funeral. But I’m not coming here *to* be sad. Sure, the hole your mother left in my heart when she died will might never be filled again, but that’s okay. It doesn’t have to be, and it likely won’t be.” I said, locking eyes with him.

“But—when I think of her, I want those thoughts to be ones that make me happy, not sad. Because of your mother, I have you. And she had us. She was overjoyed to leave behind the legacy that is you and me, and—and—and here, looking at you—I see her. Not REALLY her, but she’ll live on through you, something beautiful for me to work for.”

A tear rolled down his face before numerous others followed and he wrapped me up in a hug while sobbing.

“I—I love you, dad. I love you.”

I was crying too by this time, so I did the only thing I could think of.

I hugged him back.

“I love you, son. I love you so much.”

A solid 5 minutes had passed before we separated.

“Okay,” I said, wiping my face and giving him a pat on the back. “Let’s go in there, shall we? Don’t want to keep everyone waiting for the guests of honor.”

He grabbed my hand. “Okay, let’s go! But, I might cry during it.”

“That’s fine, it’s normal to feel like that. Especially in a situation like this.”

“Are you going to cry, dad?”

“Maybe. I might not be as ready as I say I am.”

“An—and that’s fine with you? You’re okay with the fact that it might happen?”

“Yeah, I think so.”

“Why?”

“Well, because it isn’t the end of the world, son.” I said, getting ready to open the church doors.

“I think—I think if we just keep moving forward and we keep our heads up,” I said, hand on the door. “I think everything is going to be okay.”

*And we went inside*.
