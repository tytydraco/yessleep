I grew up in a town that doesn’t exist, the people I knew are no longer real and the life I lived seems completely made up. When I search my town only some Marvel comic from the 60s comes up and I cannot remember my town being a Marvel comic.

I left the town three months ago and I cannot find it. I've searched online, checked maps, called old friends. Nothing, nothing and the lines are disconnected, it’s like the moment I left the town ceased to exist.



Plucketville was the name of the town and it was normal to an outside viewer. We had TV, local news, deliveries from Amazon and all the way from China. We were a town where people stopped on the way to bigger cities. My point is, it was REAL, people from outside came in, our town was on Google Maps, I know it was.

 I lived with my family, my Mum, Dad and younger brother named Tyler. I grew up in the same house at the end of my street until I was 24, I moved out when I wanted to go to university, study the arts. It was an 8 hour drive away and so when I stopped for my first break, I called my Mum, nothing, line disconnected. I called my Dad, disconnected. I even tried Tyler and got the same. My stomach sank and I felt like sobbing, my life’s support system had somehow all lost their phones in the course of 2 hours. I then checked their Facebook, gone, Instagrams, gone, Twitter, gone. I knew they had accounts, I followed them, I sent them memes! I decided a glitch had happened while I was in a low reception area and I would try again later. Later came, nothing. I arrived at my Uni accommodation, tried again, nothing. It was awful, I was sobbing, I barely was able to greet my flatmates. 



This constant checking and failing to contact my family and friends continued for the first 2 months, I tried to keep my head down and study but I was falling behind, how could I not. When I got my first break I decided to drive home, find out what the hell happened. That’s when I realised it wasn’t on Google anymore, I just couldn’t pull the town up, I couldn’t pull up the McDonalds in town to use that as a map marker, anything that was in Plucketville, was unsearchable.

Easy enough I thought, I remembered where it was, I remembered the turn off. So I drove, and drove and when I realised I had been driving for 10 hours I assumed I missed the turn off so I turned around and I couldn’t find a single sign for Plucketville, no turn off that mentioned it or anything I could remember around it. So I drove back to my accommodation and finally explained my situation to my friend Hancock. Hancock is a younger adult, my age. He knew about my family not contacting me but I hadn’t ever told him about their disconnecting phones. When I detailed the information he didn’t believe me, thought I was full of shit, so I showed him my driver’s licence, he Googled the home address and low and behold, wasn’t there. There were matches of street names, in different states or in different countries but no Plucketville.  

Once he went from disbelief to deep scepticism he offered me advice, he told me to contact shipping companies and claim my packages had gone missing before I left Plucketville and see if it’s still in their system. We did that all afternoon. Amazon, Auspost and Fedex had no idea which town it was and claimed there was no Plucketville they could send packages to, I asked if there were any packages that were to be dispatched to that location yet to be delivered and I wasn’t allowed to know due to privacy.

Next he told me to recall if there were any odd things that occurred in Plucketville, things that would warrant a quick but effective government coverup, so I started listing odd events that occurred in Plucketville over the course of my life and here’s what we came up with the other night;



**Ages 5-8:**

I barely remember these years but I do remember certain details, things that were always odd to me but I just took as a necessity since I was young.



First, we always left the front doors locked, we had a screen door followed by a wooden door that had a bolt lock attached. Normal. BUT we would leave the backdoor open, not just unlocked, wide open. The backdoor led to a laundry and I remember vividly whenever I needed to enter there it was constantly filled with leaves, flies and was so hard to clean we gave up. Snakes and spiders came and went multiple times and my Dad needed to shoo them away or kill them when Tyler or I got close. 

Stranger, the door from the laundry to the interior was locked, but that one backdoor needed to be wide open. One time it slammed shut in a storm and my Dad bolted up, quicker than I’ve ever seen him move and prop it open with a rock. Eventually the rock rolled and my Dad once again bolted to the back door and used a hammer to bash a hole through the door and tie it open with some old rope, just to assure it remained open.

Mum asked him to just take the door off its hinges and he shook his head and said something like, “Then we’re not opening a door, it doesn’t look inviting.”



Wasn’t just us either, my neighbours had to leave their backdoors open too, I remember hearing about so many break ins when I was younger, people exploiting the open doors and just running through houses stealing as much as they can in one go. We had a guy attempt to open our laundry door once and Dad bounced a brick off his head.



When I was 7 my neighbours across the street came round for dinner. At the table I heard a discussion about the backdoors and I remember the husband asking, “Is it even worth it? We had our TV stolen, ripped straight off the wall.”

My parents said something about us being lucky and having that secondary door, she recommended the neighbours install one just somewhere close to the backdoor in the house to prevent as much theft as they could. They told my parents they’re just going to start closing it and my parents said nothing and ended the evening soon after. I wasn’t allowed to speak to them again after that, I also never remember seeing them again. Not bringing food into the house, or walking their 3 dogs. I actually never remember hearing those dogs barking again. One yelp that night, but nothing more.



I was also forced into believing in Santa. They really wanted me to know that sometimes he sends elves to check on kids and you will see them one day, but just ignore them. I remember being told they’re not those small things I see drawings of or on TV. They didn’t have green hats or big pointy ears and they weren’t small, they’re big.

“Bigger than Daddy!” my Mum would say.

Dad would always follow it up with a soft, “Much bigger.”



Other kids at school who were raised jewish or just simply didn’t believe in Santa were told uncannily similar stories.

Michael was told that strange work men come in the night but they don’t look like people and just to stay out of their way.

Sarah was told that some lost spirits pass through but they forgot how humans looked and made mistakes and if you ever see one just ignore it since you wouldn’t want to make the spirit feel bad for looking wrong.

They always described these visitors as massive, twice the size of a human or taller.



As silly as it is, I still believe in Santa and his elves, because I saw one. We’ll get to that later.



The last thing I remember during this age was Tyler being born. He was born just before I turned 9, I was told by my parents I had a younger brother on the way and I should get excited. I was! I was so excited I got on the family computer and looked up, “Baby brother,” and, “Mum having a baby.” I saw drawings and pictures of these women with big bellies, and I was confused. I asked my Mum why she didn’t have one, why was she different?

She told me, “I don’t need to get a big belly, some people have the baby inside them for longer. I just get the baby in me when I go to the hospital.” Or something like that. 

Then one night, my Mum got in the car at around 8:30 and Dad and I got to stay up late watching movies. By 10:30 Mum was home and a still slimy baby was wrapped in a towel. Dad simply asked, “It went well?”

My Mum nodded and said, “Hurt like hell, but we did everything right!”



Hancock was telling me all this stuff isn’t normal. The backdoor being unlocked with a 5 year old wasn’t safe, elves weren’t real and women NEED to get a big belly because a baby grows in there, all pregnant women need to grow a baby in there, they don’t show up during the hospital trip. Not going to lie, I didn’t know. I knew some people didn’t believe in Santa but I assumed the whole world left their backdoors open, I also assumed some women just could go to the hospital and get the baby there. Hancock laughed a few times, treated me like my childhood naivety made me assume what my parents said was true and I carried it to adulthood. He seemed oddly shaken by the elves, that everyone in town had an “elf,” story.



**Ages 9-12:**

This is where my memory is less hazy and so will be longer because of it. It’ll also be the last part of this post because the more I remember my childhood the more upset I become. It’s all gone, just vanished. I will write more whenever I get the chance and when talking to Hancock reminds me of stuff.



During this age was when my parents really started to instill this idea that leaving Plucketville is not a good idea, but they never forbid it. They would tell me that when they were growing up Plucketville offered such wonderful opportunities. Mum went to university here and became a doctor, Dad has retained the same sales job he got when he was 20 and keeps making more and more money. Whenever I mentioned my idea of one day going to America because I saw all the cool places online my Mum said, “A dumb idea I think, America has more crime than anywhere else in the world.”

When I asked about the criminals constantly breaking into people’s houses she just told me to shut up and go to bed.



At age 10 I had been told every country I could think of was evil, had more crime or was just downright scary to visit. I would talk to my friends at school and they had the same ideas, Michael constantly would go on about how Japan was filled with radiation and mutants. Even at the time I thought he sounded a bit crazy.

I was never forbidden from going, if I plead for long enough my Mum would say that I had the ‘free will’ to go and if I wanted to I could, but I shouldn’t. Even when I would mention visiting Sydney or somewhere else in Australia I would be told, “Plucketville has everything, why waste the money?”



When I turned 11 I learned about reproduction. Now this is where Hancock told me I was, “All sorts of fucked up.”

So please don’t judge me but this is what I was taught.

There were two ways for a man and woman to reproduce. First was, “Foul Reproduction,” this was where a mother and father would manually share their seed. This was done by a man getting his penis and placing it into his partner’s vagina until he ejaculated. We were told that this manner of reproduction was disease spreading and should be frowned upon. It can create imperfect children, born wrong and with sickness. This form of reproduction was selfish, it was only used to bring pleasure to both parties involved and would risk the child’s entire life, it should be avoided but not disallowed, if we wanted to do “Foul Reproduction,” we were told we were allowed, but it should be avoided.



The second way was, “Correct Reproduction,” this was where a mother and father would contact the hospital and make a request for a child. In 3-4 days a family auditor would come around and inspect the house at night. During this time no one is to interrupt the auditor’s actions, just let it roam and observe the features of the family. When they have a good idea the auditor leaves and drops a doctor's note detailing what the mother and father must sacrifice to make sure the child ends up perfect. These sacrifices change from family to family but the examples they used were, money, blood, property or even on rare occasions lesser friends/family members. I remember Michael laughing at this and saying, “Out of towners?”

And Mrs Sheergold simply said, “Usually, yes.”

I never liked how upset she sounded compared to Michael’s joyful question. I asked him where he got that from and he explained that when he was born his parents needed to get rid of the neighbours since they came from outside Plucketville.

The final part of “Correct Reproduction,” only required female classmates and so me and the other boys had to leave. The girls seemed confused and scared when they left, they got over it eventually but for a few weeks all the girls at school barely spoke.



At 12 was when I lost Michael. He was such a good friend, heart of gold and humour to match. He never lost the smile he had on his face until the last day we saw him alive. He came to school and never went into the classes, just skulked around outside. When big lunch came around he pulled Sarah and me aside from our other friends and begged us to believe him.

“I saw one,” he said, immediately looking over his shoulder, “I saw a worker, or an elf or whatever you guys call them.”



“What do they look like?” Sarah asked, not noticing the fear brimming in Michael’s eyes. 



“Bugs, like, giant roaches or maybe beetles?” I remember him trying to use his hands to desperately show the shape, “I don’t know, like a fricking cane beetle maybe. But it only had four legs and a face on its belly.”



“Its head was on its belly?” I chimed in.



“No, no, it didn’t have a beetle head. Just a belly, with a face,” he looked desperate, “a fucking face, like a face you know?”



He burst into tears and kept repeating stuff about faces, not beetle faces, just a face. I didn’t understand him, I couldn’t gather why it was so distressing at the time. He left with a final word, running out of the school, “I’m closing the back door. I don’t want the worker to come back. I didn’t like it!”



The next day his body was found just at the outskirts of town, I never was allowed to see the body but my Mum did. She wasn’t supposed to tell Dad due to patient confidentiality and I wasn’t supposed to hear but I snooped. 

“It looked like he was dissolved in acid, his skin looked rubbery and was all twisted over itself, bubbles were under his skin and I had to burst them to get his body to sit correctly to examine it. His heart and lungs were melded into one thick slab, his legs too. Oh poor Michael, I can’t imagine what he was going through. He had brain activity for three hours after he arrived at the hospital. Three fucking hours.”



Then my Dad said, “Maybe we should tell Jacob to leave, maybe it’s worth it.”
