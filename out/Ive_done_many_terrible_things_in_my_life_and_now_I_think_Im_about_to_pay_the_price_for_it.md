I think for the safety of my family, it’s best I don’t use my real name. Just call me Rory.

All you need to know about me is that I’m fifty-two, and I was one of the richest people in the world with respectable jobs. I frequently bumped shoulders with the elite and the wealthy. I’ve had many people work under me, wishing they could be anything like me. I’ve signed many autographs from youngsters that wished others could be as ‘rich and nice’ as I. The same story has always been spun: Ever since my twenties, I was always bound for success. I was one of the most charismatic, charming and genuine people you could ever meet. 

Genuine…

What a beautiful word it is.

Truth is, I’ve done so many horrible things in my life. Terrible things that nobody would even think in years I would ever have been capable of doing. All of my heinous actions have been either shielded away by the government or was a result of my intelligence being able to outsmart everybody. Nobody was ever the wiser and I have slipped into retirement long after my hay-days were up.

So… you, as the reader, may be wondering, ‘Why? Why would you confess this? You could easily slip into retirement and everyone would remember you as an amazing person that everybody praised and wanted to be like.’

Well, most will. But maybe some of you will connect the dots and realize who I am, maybe start to look into the kind of monster I really was. Maybe finally expose my awful actions to the public once you do. And I would deserve it.

Anyways, the point of all this is that I think Karma is finally catching up with me. And I think I will be dead and burning in Hell in a matter of days. I don’t know what this qualifies as, if I’m taking the cowardly way out or having a justifiable reaction to such a horrifying situation. I’m praying that, maybe, my confession convinces God to spare me from whatever demon he’s sent to kill me.

I suppose it’s fair that I start from the beginning. When the encounters first started. 

It was a calm Thursday evening, and I was on the porch with my beautiful wife, who I’ll call Cheryll. She had spoken to me about what she had planned to do the next morning. Watering the garden, playing golf with her friends. I simply nodded along, reading my newspaper and smoking a cigar as I always tended to do. 

Finally, once she had stepped inside, I exhaled hard, smoke flying into the air. And that’s when I felt a chilling presence. Before I knew it, I had begun to shiver. My brain was internally trying to figure out why I was shivering. It was a sunny day, with only a light breeze. 

“Cheryll?” I turned toward the door, only to find that she had disappeared far quicker than I thought. I turned back, and looked toward the far end of the trees, and that’s when I saw it for the first time.

It was buried so deep in the forest, I could hardly make it out at first, all I could manage to make out were two glowing white eyes. As I tried to focus on it, I could feel my head start to throb and my vision begin to blur. I continued to stare, paralyzed with fear, which I did not know why at the time. My shivering got worse as I continued to stare at the figure and its glowing white eyes, its pupils staring me down in a way that felt almost judgmental. 

As quickly as the sensation appeared, it was gone. I blinked and realized the creature was gone. Just like that, I could move again. 

Deeply unnerved, I went to meet my wife in the house. Cheryll grinned at me, “I’ve tucked Taylor and Kay into bed.”

I grinned, despite my newfound unease, “Great. Thanks, dear.”

Cheryll, ever the smart one, expressed concern as soon as she saw my face, “Hey, are you okay?” 

“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. I just think I need some sleep.” I shrugged. I’m half sure I had been trying to fool myself, but maybe I genuinely believed that it truly was exhaustion. 

“Well, lucky for you, it’s getting late.” Cheryll chuckled, her mood returning to normal, “C’mon, sweetheart, let’s get to bed.”

“Yes, let’s…” I sighed, trying to shake the lingering headache.

The next few hours were probably the last few hours of normal I had left. We watched TV, laughed at some silly sitcom I can’t even remember, just relaxed and took in each other’s company as we had for the past twenty years. 

I had managed to quell my underlying fear with Cheryll’s company, as she always managed to. I lay in bed, Cheryll tidying herself up and laying next to me. 

“Good night, honey.” I murmured. 

“Good night.” Cheryll groggily responded. And within a few seconds, she was out. 

I tried to sleep as well, but it felt like no matter what, sleep would not come. I eventually grumbled, frustration taking over, and opened my eyes.

What greeted me was my coffee stand on the roof. 

I immediately jolted and sat up straight, realizing everything in the room apart from the bed had been turned upside down and was sitting on the ceiling. 

“Cheryll-?” I croaked in confusion, only to realize she wasn’t there. Shakily, I stood up and began to slowly trek through the dark house. 

I began to notice every other door in the hallway was open. My first thought was immediately to find Cheryll and the kids. I quickly rushed to Taylor and Kay’s shared bedroom and rushed inside. 

Their pink bedroom was obscured in darkness, but luckily, the room was semi-lit by the night lights Taylor had kept due to her fear of the dark.

Everything in their room was upside down, too, except for their beds. I quickly rushed up to their beds and saw the kids were still sleeping, looking as cozy as ever. I began thanking my lucky stars they were okay. I extended a hand to alert them-

“Beautiful, aren’t they?”

I immediately turned toward the voice, and nearly screamed when I saw the massive creature. I don’t know how, but my brain immediately knew it was the creature from earlier. Although now I could see it much more clearly.

It was a white-brown goat-like creature, its snout, arms and legs elongated, its eyes staring me down with a wide grin on its face. Black residue dripped from its eyes. 

I immediately started shivering, “What… what the fuc-“

“How lucky they are,” The creature interrupted, walking forward on its two legs. I almost flinched as it neared me, but then realized it was passing me. I almost lost my balance when I saw it approaching Taylor’s bed, where she slept soundly, completely unaware of the monster next to her. It brushed a hoof against her hair, “To have such beautiful parents.”

“What- what are you-?!”

“Yes, how lucky they truly are…” The goat grinned, ignoring everything I said as if it was talking to itself and I was invisible. Immediately as I had that thought, its head locked onto mine as it spoke almost in a childish, passive-aggressive tone, “Unlike the kids of that mother you sold into labor.” 

I froze. My heart started pounding, “What are you talking about?”

“You know what I’m talking about…” It hissed, although, despite the tone of its voice, its grin didn’t leave its face, “The mother you sold off to those men for thousands of dollars. You heard her beg and sob, pleading that she had a family… but you let them take her away.”

My brain tried anything to form a response, but the goat interrupted me again, “She did have a loving family, you know? A husband, three kids. Flint, Trevor, Amanda… They’ll never get to see her again.” It shook its head in mock pity, “How tragic, the fate that befell her little loving family. Not like you care, though, right?”

For some reason, hearing the names of the mother’s children sent spears into my heart. The goat rumbled, it sounded like a mix of laughter and a purr, “But don’t you worry, her seller will be paying very soon.”

My heart froze when I realized very quickly that it meant me. The goat seemed to know I knew what it meant, and it chuckled again, speaking in its gravelly voice, “Ah… I can see it in your face. ‘Poor little me’ is what you’re thinking, right? And why wouldn’t you be? It’s how you’ve lived your entire life. You don’t care about anything you’ve done until it comes back to bite you in the ass.”

With its grin plastered to its face, its eyes began to glow brighter and brighter… And at first, I was confused. Until I saw my kids’ skin become more doughy. I screamed as Taylor and Kay’s bodies began to slowly melt, the skin slowly oozing like flour, blood starting to spill out of the openings of their bodies. 

“Poor little you, poor little you!” The goat chirped, childishly, “Where you’re going, they like to party.” 

Tears filled my eyes, more focused on my two little girls than the goat’s ramblings, but I looked back at it when that last sentence struck me. I was feeling so distraught that I could barely muster anything out apart from whimpers.

Its eyes became slits as it sadistically grinned, what remained of Taylor and Kay slowly melted off the bed, slowly pooling around the goat’s legs. 

“You’re a monster.” I finally managed to choke out, gasping for air as my sobs took the breath out of me.

“There’s only one monster,” The goat’s muzzle scrunched with sadistic glee, “And he’s the reason I’m here.”

“I didn’t do anything! You have the wrong-!” I started, my voice cracking.

“Bullshit.” The goat’s voice went low, as if it was trying to sound angry, but a laugh disguised as a rumble managed to escape it, “You’ve dodged Karma long enough. Now it’s time for Karma to finally get what its due.”

It slowly walked toward me, its white glowing eyes staring at me, glowing so brightly that I could feel my eyes irritate more and more until it felt like actual pain.

“Tick tock, Rory…” The goat giggled, far too amused despite the situation, “They’re preparing an amazing feast for you in Hell.”

Just as I screamed, I awoke. My screams woke Cheryll immediately. I was shivering and panting, I hadn’t even realized tears were pouring down my face.

“Honey, baby, are you-?!” Cheryll startled, but jolted when I threw the covers off.

I immediately sprinted out of bed and ran through the hallway, bursting into my daughters’ bedroom.

Immediately, the two sprang up, startled. Not melted… not two bloody heaps on the ground.

Cheryll ran in after me, “Rory, what’s going on?”

I was too filled with emotion to properly say anything more. The hours after that were a blur, Cheryll comforting me, then the kids, who were scared of my sudden outburst. Eventually, the kids went back to sleep and the two of us slowly walked out of their room. 

Cheryll was trying to make sense of everything going on, “Rory, what was that all about?”

“A nightmare,” My voice quivered, my body shivering relentlessly, “A terrible, terrible nightmare.”

But even I knew that was a load of bullshit. This was far more than a terrible nightmare.

The next few days weren’t much better. At first, it was just in my dreams. The goat, who I’ve learned called itself Karma, would meet me every night and show me my sins like a playback. 

A man that had been sniped by a hitman I hired in front of his daughters after he found out too much about me. A woman whose drink I drugged and took back to my place one night. A family I got forcefully kicked out of their home because they couldn’t afford rent that month. Many more things I don’t even think I could post on here. 

Karma had looked at me and asked, “Who would do such terrible things?” after one of my worst actions.

I had stayed silent, the guilt coursing through my veins. Karma had just stared down at me, its wicked grin plastered on its face.

But then Karma started appearing in my normal life, too. I could see it staring at me as I worked, as I was with my family. It was as if it was a wicked reminder, that I didn’t deserve anything I had.

The most horrifying thing is that I started losing track of what was real and what wasn’t. A few days ago, I had walked into my room, only to find Cheryll, pale and lifeless with a bullet hole between her eyes. Right where the man had been sniped.

I had screamed until my voice gave out, but then from behind me, Cheryll had run up and in a concerned voice, asked if I was okay, and I was really starting to scare her now. I looked back, and her body was gone.

Cheryll said she was really worried about me and insisted I needed help and how she was scheduling for me to meet a therapist next week. But at this rate, I don’t know if I’ll be making it to that appointment.

Last night, when I fell asleep (how I could still sleep at all is a miracle), I was immediately greeted with the massive goat, staring at me on the edge of the bed. 

I stood up from the bed, facing it. I said quietly, “Please, stop this.” 

Karma simply grinned, “You weren’t kind enough to show that mercy to any of your victims.” 

I said nothing. It was right. 

“It’s not often I find such rotten humans like you, but finding them is always a treat,” Karma chuckled, “I always get to play with their fears longer before their eternal damnation!” 

Karma stepped toward the door, and motioned me to follow. I would’ve run as far as I could away, but I knew from prior experience that didn’t work. So I followed it out of my room, into that everlasting darkness.

“Do you feel any regret yet? For what you did to them? Or are you simply afraid for yourself?” Karma asked, but then snorted, “Don’t answer. I already know. Karma has been through your mind.” 

I just let out a shaky breath. 

“Luckily for you, our time’s almost up! In a few days, you’ll be heading right where you deserve to be.”

I paused, then started shivering even harder. I had never felt so powerless before. Never felt so defeated.

Karma paused its walking, and turned toward me. It grinned, “Y’know, just a heads up, being scared like this gets you nowhere in Hell.” 

“Please…” My voice was shaky, “I have a family.” 

That made Karma’s smile grow wider, and it chuckled as it shook its head, “So did they, Rory. So did they.” 

Karma turned around and walked back up to me, “It’s funny, Karma has only captured a few other men and they’ve reacted the exact same way you are now. Tell me, why do you men only feel such guilt when Karma comes back to harm you for your own heinous actions? It wouldn’t be coming for you if you were a good person.”

I couldn’t find words to respond, all I could do was shiver.

Karma leaned down and stared at me directly, “You can’t do anything to be saved at this point so just embrace it, boy.” It stood up, and began to walk off. With a chuckle, it turned its head slowly back to me, “I’ll see you real soon. I am so very excited for this… You will be mine for eternity.”

It then walked off, leaving me in the darkness. 

It’s where I remained until I awoke, panting. I took a look and saw Cheryll sleeping. She and the kids were completely unaware of the fate in store for me, and for some reason, that broke my heart even more than the idea of going to Hell.

I didn’t sleep the rest of the night. As Cheryll is getting the kids ready for school, I’m writing this. I don’t know how much longer I have, but I’m willing to bet I at least have until Thursday.

After reading this, you could argue I deserve this. And you wouldn’t be wrong. But I’m writing this in hopes that God will forgive me for everything I’ve done, everything I’ve caused. I pray he saves me from the beast that I’ve unknowingly weaponized. But I’m sure even this is a long shot.

Karma always comes back around. And I think no matter what, I’m doomed to reap what I’ve sewn.
