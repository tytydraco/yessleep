I’m not quite sure where I should be posting this. I’ve tried to contact the authorities, and they laughed it off as me being overly stressed. One officer actually handed me a card for a trauma therapist. No one seems to believe me—not my sister, not Emily’s school counselor, not even my ex. I don’t know where else to turn. So… I’m posting it here. Hopefully somebody understands, or at least knows something, and can give me advice before it gets worse.

It started subtly.

Emily—ten years old, braces, freckles, an obsession with frogs and ancient myths—used to be a restless sleeper. She’d toss, mumble unintelligible things, sometimes whispering about “the black kingdom under the roots,” or “the lady in the wall.” I caught her once murmuring a name in her sleep: “Argantis.” I thought maybe she was inventing stories.

But three weeks ago, she stopped wandering and started… watching.

I first noticed her standing in the hallway around 2:14 AM. Not moving. Not making a sound. Her face was obscured by shadows, but her jaw hung slack, like no muscles were attached, then snapped shut abruptly—like she was chewing something dry.

I wrote it off as stress.

But then it happened again the next night. And the night after that. And after that.

Concerned, I installed a baby monitor in her room. For a while, it was quiet. But at exactly 2:12 AM, she’d sit up, slowly, and stare directly at the vent above her bed. Not move, not blink. Just… stare.

I called in an HVAC tech—Mike. Good guy, came out the same day. After thirty minutes, he came down from the attic shaking his head.

“System’s spotless. Looks and smells clean as a whistle,” he said, wiping his hands on his overalls. “But the vent over her bed… you might wanna take a look yourself. Just weird.”

So I did.

I unscrewed the vent cover and stuck my phone flashlight in. About two feet in, something had carved symbols into the metal. Not just symbols—tally marks. Dozens of them, deep grooves scratched in threes, fours, sometimes fives, always clustered close. Like someone—or something—was keeping count.

Later that night, I heard Emily whispering. When I asked her who she was talking to, she looked up at me, her voice too calm.

“You interrupted,” she said. “He was almost done.”

I asked who “he” was.

She smiled—not the way a child smiles. It was wrong. Rehearsed. Borrowed.

“He lives in the quiet,” she said, and then went back to bed as if nothing happened.

That night, I dreamt of our living room. But something was wrong. The walls were sweating, and every photo frame was filled with static. In the center stood a figure—long-limbed, slack, stooped, wrapped in something that looked like skin but shimmered like oil. Its face was a void. Not a hole—just a space, where a head should be. It moved like it remembered being human, but had forgotten how to mimic us properly.

It stepped forward, slow and lurching. And when it spoke, its voice was a sick blend of tones—child, old man, woman, mechanical glitch.

“Visne eam redire?”

I don’t speak Latin, but I looked it up: Do you want her back?

I woke gasping, and Emily was sitting up again, mouth slightly open. Whispering a single word over and over:

“Dissectio… dissectio…”

I found the word in a medical dictionary. Latin. It means dissection, or anatomical separation.

I think that’s what it wants to do.

I think that’s what it’s been doing.

And now… it’s not even hiding.

UPDATE: 4:09 AM

She’s sitting in the hallway now.

Not standing—sitting. Knees drawn up to her chest. Rocking. Just slightly. Her mouth is moving, but I can’t hear anything.

There’s something behind her. Not touching her—but it’s around her. A shadow stretching from the ceiling down across the wall like a curtain pulled halfway back.

It isn’t shaped right.

Too tall, too thin, and it bends where things shouldn’t bend.

I tried to look away, to go back into my room, but I couldn’t move. My legs wouldn’t respond.

Then Emily turned her head.

Not all the way. Just enough to see me from the corner of her eye.

She hasn’t blinked. Not once. Not since this started.

And I just realized something else—she’s still whispering that word.

Only now… it’s not her voice anymore.
