I went back inside. 

 I didn't know what I was looking for, or why i was back in that hell hole, but I had to return to look. 

 I soon found myself staring at the spot where I last saw my friend but i forced myself to move on and quickly walked back to the room I had explored that painful day. Finding nothing of interest, I moved on to the room from which the mysterious voice originated from -the one down the hall-. Walking inside, I started looking, but found nothing. Disappointed, I entered the closet, and sat down, stared at the wall and regreted my choice of revisiting that dreadful house. 

 As I tried to get up, I placed my hand on the closet wall and pushed to lift my body off the ground. However instead of standing up, a small hatch opened, and I found myself falling face-first into a tiny room with a set of old wooden stairs.

 Curious and thinking I had discovered the resolution to my friend's missing case, I carefully, yet eagerly, walked down. The stairs made a peculiar sound—the kind that old wood produces when pushed to its limits. It was a miracle I didn't fall. 
 
 I soon found myself at the bottom of the stairs, where a small tunnel had been dug, barely big enough for me to crawl through. The tunnel was quite long, around 100 meters, and its walls were filled with scratching marks, as if someone or something was trying to avoid the inevitable end of reaching the other side. Upon finally reaching the end, I was shocked to find there was absolutely nothing—just a dirt wall.   

 Before I could process the disappointment that this was, I heard wood creaking—the stairs. Someone was coming down, and I had nowhere to go. In a hurry, I turned off my flashlight and went into a fetal position, painfully waiting for what would possibly be a very unpleasant death. I heard something quickly crawling towards me, and I knew I would soon meet my friend again. I thought it was over, i would soon be meeting the fate I had escaped three years ago, when i abandoned my friend. 
 
 I spend the last few seconds thinking about my mother, and what she was about to go through. I was about to disappear as well.
 
 It reached me, right in front of my face. I could hear it breathing, but it didn’t do anything, it just sat there.
 
 I waited until it stopped breathing, and I carefully lifted my hand, tightly holding the flashlight, pointing it at the other side of the tunnel. 

 To my shock, when I turned it on, the 100 meters I had painfully crawled through had magically turned to less than 5. The old wooden stairs were now in front of me. I wasted no time. As soon as I reached them, I ran, cutting my hand in the process. I reached the top and left the closet, the room, and eventually the house without any other issues. I ran back home and told my mother everything.

 I have never heard my mother yell like that, she called me all kinds of things, but she was right. I had no business going back there. 

 Nevertheless, she called the cops. I ended up going to the hospital to get stitches for the cut I got while running up the stairs. 
 
 The police officers came by the hospital to inform me that they didn't find any hatch.  

 When I insisted on the existence of the hatch and the tunnel, they told me that they opened a hole in the wall, and when i asked them what was on the other side, they looked at me and said:

“The sky”
