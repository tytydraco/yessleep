 Work has been frustrating for the past several days. Too many late nights that had dragged on past what I thought I was willing to tolerate. But regardless, something about those drives home was a different feeling. The way you feel the release of all the tension held from the day mixed in with the stiffness of your muscles creates a bittersweet mood within the car. The only thought that runs through my head during times like these though is how ready I am for bed. As tempting as it is to just sit in the driveway once I get home, I force myself to collect my things and make my way inside. 

Bracing the cold and bitter winds of the winter season, I make my way inside. I’ve always hated the short walk from my car to my doorway. I live in a fairly safe and well populated neighborhood, but, you see, I grew up in a farm home, so something about the plastic and inorganic feeling of a suburb just unnerves me. The copy-paste architecture of housing, the way that street lamps linger over empty sidewalks and how there’s no real signs of life besides crickets piercing through the wind. I know it’s silly for me to be unnerved by this… but it just gets under my skin. Getting my keys into the lock, my home invites me in with the relieving warmth that saves me from the cold. I finally feel that I can relax as I put my things away. 

I do the regular gist of things, unload my bags, hang up my coat, brush my teeth, and change for bed. I end my nightly routine by recluding to my bed and watching TV. My bed holds that comforting cool that you'd expect from an untouched comforter. Something about the sensation has just been something that I’ve always looked forward to since I was a kid. As I nestle off to sleep, I close my eyes and allow the fading sounds of the TV to give me peace in my rest. I go to quickly turn it off right before I fall completely under, and within the first five minutes of it being off, I find myself wide awake. I don’t know why I work like this, but something about the background noise helps me fall asleep, but at the same time I don’t like leaving it on all night. 

Regardless, I lay in bed waiting for sleep to just come naturally. Truth be told though, I hate this sensation. Nights like these are always a flip of the coin; do I allow my exhaustion to allow me to sleep? Or do I dwell in my bed for what feels like hours waiting for sleep. On those restless nights, it’s like my anxiety is fighting for something to be alert for. I find myself beginning to get irrationally fearful of things that I wouldn’t get a second thought to. Focusing on the silhouette made by the pile of clothes in the corner of my room, to make sure it doesn’t move. Staring at my closet to see if there’s anything that lurks from within, or worst of all; Allowing my mind to wander, thinking about what could be hiding in the dark hallway just outside my bedroom door. I know that these are childish things to be concerned about, but seriously, you’re telling me that you’re *not* ever scared of the dark? 

Something about it is just so underlyingly primitive. I suppose everyone says it’s the fear of the unknown, but for me, it’s the fear of my own ideas. My mind would drift, thinking of the worst, most upsetting concepts of what could lie just outside- just beyond the threshold of the cracked door that separates me from the abyss that I called a home. With my sight being limited to the dark, my body naturally honed in on what I could hear. The wind that perpetrated against my walls, my radiator fighting to keep me comfortable, the pipes that ran throughout rotating its contents, but something was missing. The sound of crickets chirping. The one thing that I found annoying when I tried to sleep was absent, and under any other circumstance, I’d consider this a blessing, but for whatever reason, this bothered me to my core. I thought to myself that the only reason that they would stop… is if something else was out there.

While my subconscious was bothered by this, I could still rationalize and say that what I was thinking was an absurd over reaction. But in the middle of this mental conversation with myself, I clung onto the sound of a floorboard creaking from outside my door. It was long, still, concentrated. My mind raced as to what it could be. It didn’t feel like the creaks that I was used to in a house that was settling, it was caused, directly influenced by some outside force. The sound of it felt drawn out and very thoughtful, as if it was the slow press of something lurking at a steady pace. I sat there focused, eyes wide towards the door, desperately clinging on to any other thing that happened. But nothing. There were no other creaks, no signs of activity, nothing to really suggest that anything was wrong. I was almost ready to force myself to shrug it off and just try to fall back asleep, but the moment I began to shift my body to go back under the covers, I heard the sound of heavy and rapid footsteps from down the hallway. At first they were quiet, but as they approached their sound grew into a tantalizing roar until they reached the door. At that point, it was quiet.

 I wasn’t tired anymore at this point, hell I was barely in my bed anymore. I sat straight up staring straight at my doorway completely unbreaking. My body was a prison to my mind as adrenaline coursed through me. I sat there still & stiff, clinging onto my sheets with a death grip as a cold sweat rolled down my back. They say that during panic moments like this you go into fight or flight, but when the situation is this dire, there’s nothing to do besides freeze, and pray that whatever is there goes away. All the noises that I submerged myself in subsided, and all I could sense was the sound of my own heart racing in my body. I sat there, for too long in a gut wrenching panic feeling as if I could throw up.

 My attention was ripped away from the door though as my TV flashed on with intense static. The overbearing screeching filled my room and almost made me have to cover my ears from the irritation. This made me jump in my bed but as I focused back towards the door, I was horrified to see that the once slightly cracked door was now a gaping void as the door was wide open. Quietly I sat there, whimpering. I couldn’t handle it anymore, I couldn’t begin to imagine what lies there, waiting for me to drop my guard, waiting for me to close my eyes just for a moment. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t cry out for help, I was choked up on my own tantalizing, unknowable fear. All I could do was sit there, crumbling away in my own body, thinking of what lingers just beyond the threshold.
