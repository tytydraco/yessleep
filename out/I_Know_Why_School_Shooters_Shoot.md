I was almost a school shooter.

Gun bought.

Manifesto written.

Soul sold.

That is the final requirement you're not told about: the Soul Selling.

Every school shooter wanted to kill himself first before HE came and asked for their soul.



When you're about to take the big exit, HE comes to you - the naked dark-blue man with peach eyes and wings shaped like the infinity symbol.



2 a.m. moonlight hugged my room, and a gentle summer breeze kissed my skin. Tears welled and stung my eyes. I shoved and grazed my Dad's Glock in my mouth, tasting the oily, dirty metal. My finger tapped and debated on the trigger when he peeled out of a shadow, flat like a sticker, and then flesh wrapped around his outline until he was brought to all three dimensions of this world.



"Wait," it said.



My watery eyes blinked.

*Is this real?*

*Why wouldn't the world let me die?*



"I have a choice for you," he said.



I yanked the gun from my mouth.



"Get out!" I yelled. "My Dad's here andâ€”"



"He's not here. We both know no one is ever here for you," the dark-blue man said.



His infinity wings fluttered in an immediately skin-crawling twitch. The stench of a stink bug wafted from his skin, and his presence caused the cool wind to flee and punish the room with heat. Tears avalanched from me, a wicked combination of his stench, the heat, and the harsh truth of his words.



"Would you like to know the choice I have for you?"



"No," I said.



"Well, when has anyone ever cared about what you want? Here are your choices: You can kill yourself today and rot in Hell, or you can kill your classmates who mistreated you, and I will make your stay in Hell quite pleasant - a good bed, girls, boys, whatever you like. No pleasure will be denied. All I ask is that you get revenge before you go. Even revenge on Tom Lucas."



The word 'revenge' thrust me out of sadness. Two years of torture at my classmates' hands was enough. But also this last thing they did... Tom Lucas spent a year pretending to be my ex-girlfriend and was spreading a video of me doing... acts to myself because I'm an idiot and believed I could get a girlfriend.



"What if I didn't kill myself or anyone?" I asked. "What if I just stayed around?"



"Oh, then you'll not only be tortured at home, but you will be tortured by me. Once you see one spirit, you'll never stop seeing them."



"Oh, that's awful. Who are you? How do I know I can trust you?"



His peach eyes narrowed and his infinity wings flicked. The creature frowned, annoyed; I shrunk back, fearing trouble.



"Do I look like I'm part of the unholy legion? Do I look like I'm from Hell? Come on, kid, think."



"Sorry, um. You do demon stuff like whispering in other people's ears and stuff."



"If I'm summoned," he groaned.



"Summoned by who?"



He groaned, and again I slunk back.



"Oh okay, well deal then. Um, okay deal, but I still need a little more proof."



He berated me as only a demon could.



"Can I meet more of you?" I asked.



"Sure, kid, sure. Get the guns and stuff, and then we'll meet again."



And we did meet again, the next morning. There were about twenty of them. I killed them with bullets dipped in holy water. Job done. I went to school hoping for a better situation now that those who I thought influenced my classmates were dead.



And yet, it was the strangest thing: from a distance, I saw Tom Lucas breaking into my locker and stuffing a few water balloons in it. That wasn't that strange. The strangest part was that the more he did this, the more his shadow changed and came to life. Almost like with every action against me, he was summoning the Dark Blue Man with Infinity Wings.
