It was a dark and stormy night. It was the kind that sends shivers down your spine and makes you want to curl up underneath your covers and never come out. The wind was howling like a pack of wolves, and the rain was coming down heavily, lashing against the windows like angry fists.   
Travis and his father, Spencer, went on a road trip and have been on the road for hours; they were traveling back home from the campsite. Before they knew it, Spencer detected a strange smell that seemed to be emanating from the source of the engine.  
Upon noticing the strange smell, it caused him to wrinkle his nose and glance at his dashboard. The temperature gauge was almost in the red zone. Spencer starts to worry as he notices his car starting to overheat and wonders what could be causing it.  
“What’s that strange smell coming from within the air vent?” Spencer asked as he stopped in the stormy rain. Taking advantage of the opportunity, he exited the car, checked the coolant level, and found it to be dangerously low.  
Spencer tries to remember the last time he took his vehicle in to get it serviced and came to the realization that it had been a while. With no other options in sight and with it getting later in the night, Spencer jumped back into the car in the middle of nowhere. He restarted his car, and began to drive through the pouring rain, ignoring the car’s warning signs that the car was giving off. He hoped that his vehicle would hold up.  
After traveling a few kilometers, they were forced to pull over when the car’s engine suddenly stopped working. Before they knew what was going on, anxiety and fear crept in. A feeling of overwhelming fear quickly washed over them. This made their hearts race just like they had just seen a dead body.  
Despite Spencer’s repeated attempts to restart the engine, it remained unresponsive and showed no signs of wanting to start. It was soon made clear that they were both in a big mess as they found themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere. Being enclosed by the thick forest bushes, they both felt a sense of unease. It was at this point where they started to hear unsettling sounds which seemed to be coming from all around them.  
Without delay, Spencer brought out his cell phone and dialed for help. Hoping to let his wife know where he was, he checked his phone, only to find out that he was in an area that didn’t have network coverage. There wasn’t even a single bar of signal to make an emergency call. Finding this out it only added to the sense of unease which scared him because he knew that without any reception that his location would remain unknown.  
As much as he wanted to reach out to someone, his phone battery was on the brink of dying, making it useless. That wasn’t even the worst of it. No, the worst was what was lurking outside in the darkness. Something that was waiting for its chance to strike. Something evil, something extremely sinister, something that would haunt them within their dreams for years to come. Spencer felt this and had the hunch that it was getting closer.  
Fortunately, Spencer had a few raincoats that were resting on his car’s backseat. Without any hesitation or delay, he immediately grabbed one. This would allow him to shelter himself from the downpour and prevent himself from getting completely soaked. As he scoured the area for a location that had network reception in the stormy rain, he was now unconscious of Travis’s whereabouts.   
  
Travis was sitting inside the car trying to collect himself when he was surprised by the unexpected sound of a voice. It was coming from deep within the woods. He said, “Oh, this must be Spencer screaming in distress.” With little time, Travis grabbed a spare raincoat from the car’s back seat. In a hurry, he ventured into the woods to find out what was happening. As he drew closer, he listened and followed Spencer’s voice. The voice seemed to be coming from within a tunnel.  
Travis approached the tunnel and noticed an entrance. Looking around, he saw unfamiliar inscriptions engraved into the side of the walls. This made him panic; within a twinkle of an eye, his legs were shaking and heavy, making him almost pee his pants in complete fright.  
Overwhelmed by shock and fear, he could barely make out Spencer’s voice, which seemed to echo from the depths of the tunnel. Being convinced that it was his dad’s voice, he gathered his courage and took a bold step forward.  
Venturing his way deeper inside, the air became thick and musty. A nauseating stench hit Travis as he navigated through the tunnel, which had bones and cracked skulls everywhere.  
Fully aware that today could be his last day on earth, he took a deep breath and braced himself for whatever lay ahead. The complete darkness ahead of him was suddenly broken by a noise that abruptly caught his attention. Travis wondered what it could be. As he traversed deeper inside of the tunnel, the noise grew louder and more threatening the further he went.  
Despite his fear and the pounding of his heart, Travis moved forward with extreme caution; his phone was gripped tightly in his hand as he tried to call Spencer to secure his location. Before Travis knew what was happening, the tunnel began to twist and turn, causing him to lose his sense of direction and becoming hopelessly lost.  
The chill of the air became more intense, and Travis could feel that he was being watched from the darkness ahead of him. He tried to retrace his footsteps, but it was already too late. A pack of monsters emerged from the darkness completely out of nowhere.  
Their eyes gleamed with hunger, and each one of them stood at least ten feet tall. The monsters’ skin was leathery and scaly, and their muscles rippled. The monstrous creatures’ eyes gleam like fiery coals within the dark, and their jagged teeth glisten in the dim light.  
The monster’s hunger is rumored to be unmatched, with rumors of them being able to devour anything in their path. Their razor-sharp claws scrape the tunnel wall as they move closer to Travis. He realized too late that he had stumbled into the lair of these terrifying creatures. The shape-changing monsters were a constant threat. They were unpredictable and dangerous, since they could transform into any person known to the individual. This would make identifying them nearly impossible.  
The monsters’ hunger was unmistakable as they pounced on Travis after waiting so long. He fearlessly tried to defend himself, but the creatures were too much for him. The monsters were so strong that they quickly overpowered him, which caused him to be adopted and dragged away. He was left unsure of why they didn’t kill him instantly.   
As the pack of monsters dragged Travis away, he yelled at the top of his lungs in terror. The creatures were pulling him towards the depths of the underground tunnel, where their alpha was. Aware of the inevitable outcome, Travis kept shouting at the top of his lungs while dragged by the monstrous creatures. The screams he emitted were so intense that they echoed throughout the tunnel and caused him to faint.  
Fortunately, Spencer had picked up on a faint sound that was coming from a particular direction. The sound was muffled, however, he could tell that it was coming from somewhere nearby and it sounded like someone was in trouble. Hearing this, Spencer left what he was doing immediately and went back to check the car where he had left his son at. He then noticed that the car was empty and that his son was missing.  
Instantly Spencer knew that the voice that he was hearing was Travis’s. He tried dialing Travis’s phone, but it was of no use. He was stuck with the same issue, which terrified and devastated him. Before he knew what was happening, he sprinted into the woods, unaware of what or who he would face while running.   
As he ran, his heart pounded, and his thoughts turned to the worst outcomes. He was wondering where Travis could be. Did a giant bear attack him? Or was Travis pulling his usual pranks on him? Not knowing the answer was beyond his wildest imagination.  
Lost in thoughts, he stumbled across a hut that was surrounded by weird flowers which had a disturbing smell to them. It had different mirrors at each cardinal point. He then observed a cloud of smoke that was coming from the chimney as he walked through the dense forest. The roof is made of thatched straw and slopes down steeply to help prevent rain from seeping in. The hut is surrounded by thick underbrush and towering trees, giving it a sense of seclusion and privacy.  
Outside the hut, he noticed an old, rusty ax leaning against the wall. As Spencer approached the ax, he saw the sticky red substance coating the blade. He was unaware if it had been used as a murder weapon back in the day or not since it had been there for a while, as it was now covered in rust and cobwebs.  
As he approached the entrance, Spencer noticed the open door creaking gently in the breeze. Inside, you see a dimly lit interior with a single room. It had a bed of rough-hewn planks and a small fireplace in the corner. The fireplace emits a faint glow, casting flickering shadows upon the hut’s walls. The room is furnished with only a small table and a few chairs. It gave off a feeling of emptiness and solitude.  
Despite the safety of the cabin, he knew that his chances of finding his son before anything terrible happened to him would be slim if he decided to remain indoors. Spencer returned outdoors, grabbed the ax, and immediately headed toward the spot where he had heard his son’s voice moments before. It was coming from deep within a tunnel.  
Spencer approached the entryway to the tunnel’s entrance; it was already open. He stepped through it with caution. His attention was almost immediately drawn to a very tall, broad-shouldered figure. The figure was sitting in the corner of a room. It was holding an ax that had fresh blood dripping from it.   
Spencer then noticed this very creature devoured a whole deer right before him. The creature he saw couldn’t be categorized as a man or a beast because this creature looked well built. It had intensely sharp fangs and an imposing frame that seemed to fill the space. The creature’s presence was terrifying and commanding.  
The humanoid-shaped creature was dressed. He wore a plain black t-shirt and dark jeans that hugged his muscular legs. His biceps bulge slightly as he folds his arms across the creature’s chest; who dares disturb me during my meal? Speak before I make you my next. Immediately, Spencer heard the beast’s voice, and his heart began to race. He realized that he was face-to-face with an intimidating-looking creature.   
The creature had a huge appetite, enough to eat a whole deer. Spencer then started trembling as Jack, the demon slayer, moved in to get closer. Allowing the creature to look better at who his prey would be, he noticed a lifeform that smelled like a human vessel.  
Spencer noticed an eye patch at close contact. The eye patch was covering Jack’s left eye. He then saw the deep cuts of claw markings on him. They were all over his forearms and face. The markings from the cuts were more like embedded scars given to someone who fought with a wild beast and nearly died.  
Without hesitation, Jack the demon slayer asked who you were and what brought him to this evil forest. Pardon me, did you say evil forest Spencer asked? The demon slayer laughed heavily... look around, earthling. Does any of this look normal to you? I thought as much Spencer said, narrating the whole situation…  
Oh, I see, so your boy is missing; Spencer began to explain the predicament to Jack, dear stranger, please help me. My only son is missing; I do not know how this happened. I’m sure I heard his voice from somewhere deep within the forest. Jack asked him, “Did you check for footprints?” I tried to say Spencer, but they were covered and couldn’t even be traced.  
Hmm..... many demons lurk around the environment in this forest, and any one of them could have abducted your son. Therefore, I need more clues for me to locate him. Jack asked, “Do you have anything that belongs to your son?” Here I have his handkerchief, “quickly hand it over.” Spencer was surprised and asked, “How would this be of help.” “You ask too many questions!” Jack exclaimed. Jack then collected the handkerchief and sniffed it,   
While Spencer was observing what was going on, he noticed Jack’s eyes turning blue. Lost in thought, it was as if Jack was out of consciousness. It looked like he was lost in a trance as he traced the scent back to Travis. In a cloudy form in his imagination, he saw Travis waking up from being unconscious. He hoped all that had happened to him was only a bad dream. This dream was already a reality, happening to him in 4K. He had opened up to reality and accepted the whole scenario.   
Travis opened his eyes completely; he was lying on a cold, damp floor inside a dark room. He was disoriented, confused, and scared. Despite his efforts to stand up, he noticed that he couldn’t move his limbs. Travis realized he was tied up with ropes and couldn’t break free from his bindings. He looked around the room and saw it was dimly lit with candles. The candles were giving off an eerie glow of light.   
Travis could see that the walls were made of rough stones and had no windows. He also noticed strange symbols and drawings on the walls, which he couldn’t understand. Suddenly, Travis heard footsteps that seemed to be approaching. He panicked and tried to break free from his bindings, but it was useless. The door creaked open, and Travis saw a group of people standing before him.   
They wore long black robes, and their faces were concealed underneath their masks. Travis couldn’t see their faces, but could tell they weren’t up to any good. One individual stepped forward and spoke in a deep, raspy voice. Welcome, earthling, you are here to be our sacrifice.  
Our ritual requires a human every year; this year, it’s your turn. Don’t fight back; it will only worsen your situation. Travis was horrified. He didn’t understand what was happening or why he was there. He pleaded with the monsters and asked them to let him go. The demons just laughed at him. They then began to chant strange words.  
At this very moment, Travis realized he was in grave danger. The air in the room was quite heavy with the stench of decay as the monsters closed in on him, their voices saying an eerie chant. A cold sweat broke out on his forehead, his heart racing as he desperately tried to devise a plan to escape. He suddenly heard a booming voice that was coming from within his head. It was a sinister voice, one that seemed to be coming from nowhere and everywhere at the same time.   
The voice belonged to Jack, the demon slayer who had spotted him out through his psychic power. Jack instructed him to relax and sit still as he and his father were on their way. As they approached, they could hear the sounds of Travis’s cries for help from within the tunnel. Jack and Spencer quickly acted, taking out the monsters individually, using their weapons and expert fighting skills.  
As they traversed deeper, they were suddenly confronted by the monster’s leader, who seemed to materialize out of the shadows. It was a towering beast that had razor-sharp teeth and glowing red eyes. Jack wasn’t one to back down from a fight. He charged forward with a fierce battle shout, dodging the beast’s attacks and delivering devastating blows.  
Ultimately, it was a close fight, but Jack emerged victorious. He freed Travis from his bindings and carried him out of the lair, back outside to his waiting father. Travis’s dad was overjoyed to see his son again, safe and sound.  
Travis couldn’t believe what had happened to him. From a young age, he had been warned about the evil entities that crept in the dark of night. It was something he never imagined happening to him. He was filled with appreciation for Jack and his father. Their bravery and selflessness in rescuing him from the monsters were engraved in his mind, and he knew he would never forget it.
