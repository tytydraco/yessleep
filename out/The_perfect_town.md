The first memory I have, was the sun, a warm kiss on my face. I was sitting on the legs of the grass, verdant and green and prickly. A woman was the next thing I saw, with hair the color of perfectly crystalline sand, twisting down her neck. She leaned down to me, wearing the most beautiful sundress I had ever seen, flowing down her ankles. Her eyes were the most pretty color of the azure sea. Her lips crinkled up when she smiled.

"Don't worry Thomas." She said, her voice, a soft spoken angelic melody.

"You're safe now."

My name was Thomas, I was home. The hills seemed to roll down, each one curving in the emotion of melancholy. The sun was the warmest feeling I could ever imagine. The sun was raw and had a surreal feeling to it.

The woman's name was Elara, my mother. Bathed in beauty, she taught me to read in leatherbound books under oak trees that were planted more than 200 years ago. Their leaves rustling, as if they were whispering secrets amongst each other. She taught me to swim in the purest, clearest river, that twisted itself along the backroads of the valley. She taught me the names of the stars and the history of the stories of the constellations, that were placed directly in view. Life was an ongoing ecstasy.

As I grew, the village grew to be more beautiful. The home where we lived, was a quaint house, with floorboards that creaked and groaned. Old smears of makeup on the dark wooden dresser. A ginormous flower field accompanied itself with the most magnificent flowers. The bees flitted between the flowers. When I went to school, I met a mixed kid called Max with black glasses who loved to climb trees and Maya, a shy girl who loved to paint.

One thing that I later questioned was the eras seemed to change. Once I had Max over, Elara who was usually in dresses no matter the weather, had big blonde hair piled up like a Playboy magazine model in the 80s. She had jeans and a woolen jumper. She was on a work call on a brick phone. And Cyndi Lauper was playing quietly from the record player, a month would go by and she would be wearing crinolines and corsets. I didn't question it at first because I was a kid.

I grew up with them, playing hide-and-seek in the whispering woods, in the pink sky mirrored by the sunset that allowed the dusk and afterglow to slowly seep in. Built forts out of fallen trees by the river, and told ghost stories by the crackling fire. Sometimes we would drink homemade apple pie. I learned my woodworking skills from Max's dad Silas and I carved a small wooden bird for Maya. She treasured it.

Years bled into each other, packed with festivals, carnivals, birthdays and beach vacations. Maya's dad would always take his caravan out, and we would ride in our car listening to The Sundays and The Smiths. Moments of joy with one and other. When I was twelve, Maya had moved to the city, we stopped writing after a while out of boredom.

Elara grew older, her once blonde hair had now transformed into the color of silver moonwater. Her blue eyes still etched with the same beauty they did a few years ago. Max went off to become a singer in a band that I saw to become quite popular among the countries. He visited us during Christmas and sometimes my birthdays. He soon married a woman from the south. Anna.

I, too, fell in love. When I was seventeen. I had seemed to forget about Maya, until she came back to Canada for a few weeks. I met her when I was sailing along the twisted creek. We spent hours talking and laughing. I called her on a Blackberry phone for the next few months when she was studying to become a businesswoman. We were soon married in the summer by the beach, everyone smiling, Max and his band buddies playing in the wind. Elara and her friends cracking open champagne bottles with mild alcohol. Silas playing with Maya's nieces.

We bought a newly renovated house, it came with 8 VHS tapes and a kitchen television. For the next three years, we watched 1-2 movies every day on random channels, some being bad and immature, others being immaculate. Maya had worked on a successful bar-soap company. I was working in a video-store. Some days, Max would be off for a holiday, and Anna and Maya would be baking; sweet breads and cupcakes. The house would always smell as if something was cooking.

Maya went through this stage where she loved quirky little trinkets, cat clocks. Colourful vases and posters from indie movies. It lasted all spring, and kids used to look through her window, seeing all the little details. She would make puppets for kids out of straw and raw cotton.

We went to a Dixie Chicks concert together, I took her fishing one weekend. Nothing of the sad occurred when I was with her. It was the definition of perfect.

One day, Maya told me she was pregnant with a girl. I was ecstatic, the news hit me with, pure, unadulterated, joy. The feeling of becoming a parent hit me with the most excitement I have ever encountered.

During her pregnancy, she became obsessed with quiz shows while Elara knitted beside her, she was so good, she said the answers before they were even on screen. Max, Anna and Silas were all there.

Our little girl, Ellie had hair the color of trees just before they burst with flowers. I made sure she was educated before she went into school, then Maya was pregnant with a little boy called Ethan. His laughter filled the room with joy and happiness. I watched them take their first steps, their first words, Ellie's first A+, Ethan's first win in soccer, everything. I saw everything. I was a father. I was the happiest one could be. When I was 39, Maya had yet again blessed me with another child. I called her Tia, after a movie that Ellie had loved when she was a small child. We were soon to discover that she loved art, just like her mother.

Ellie had been studying abroad to become a famous actor. Ethan who was now sixteen, had travelled away to become a "soccer-superstar". As he would call it, everyone said our kids were 'gifted' and how we were so lucky, out came another kid. People joked on how Maya was a "baby machine" but I didn't find that funny at all. We called him Samuel.

Ellie had become a well-known actor, I watched and loved every single one of her films with a passion.

But when Sam was three, and Tia was seven, that's when things started to get odd.

It started off very subtle, faces in the valley that were not quite right, I dismissed them as ordinary encounters in life. But then there were whispers, calling out my name. I told myself it was imagining things.

But then, came the dreams. Empty voids stretching in every direction, large grotesque figures bouncing off the walls and chasing me. They began to fade into my own life too. The colors which once absorbed the village were getting a bit more monotone. I tried talking to Max, Elara, Anna, Silas and Maya but they denied me. Saying I was 'working too hard' and that I 'needed to take more rest'. Eventually I was given some medication which helped for a few months. But the whispers grew louder and louder.

A year later, on and off with the whispers and the dreams. I had noticed the town showing a few cracks. The streets shifting themselves, and Mrs. Blumesbell, the friendly neighbour, didn't look right. Ellie's films started to feel almost as fever dreams and Ethan's soccer matches on live TV didn't feel right. I just couldn't point my finger on it. The town's smiles were once welcoming. But now they felt... different, almost predatory. I was given a doctor since Elara couldnâ€™t bear to see me like this. Another 8 years went by and I had seemed to have forgotten all about the dreams.

Until, I was walking Sam in the park, I saw a man dressed in black, his face was blurred, indistinct, but his eyes were cold, black and noir. I felt a jolt of fear kick in, scared for my son. The flashbacks came back.

"Are you alright dad?" My son's voice said, the sound of worry in his voice.

"Yes, Sam, just a little tired." I said forcing a smile.

One day, I woke up in a cold sweat. My heart shaking against my rib cage. Maya was missing from her side of the bed, I stumbled out. The moon was casting eerie shadows alongside the carpet. Maya startled me.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

"You're starting to see Thomas." She said, her voice was raspy and cold.

I lunged for her, but she was gone. I searched the entire house, and then finally got the courage to go outside.

Outside, I saw everyone I knew. Even some of Maya's co-workers that occasionally came to our house. Including Maya.

"What are you doing, Ellie, weren't you supposed to be working on that new movie?" I finally uttered on.

Elara stood from the line of people.

"It's time you understood." She smiled.

"What, that I'm a wizard?" I tried making a joke.

"Welcome back Thomas, we have been waiting for you to understand." At this point I thought it was all a big joke, until I looked at their faces. Every single one reflected no light. It was just almost saturated.

I tried to run to wake up from this nightmare. But they closed in, I screamed, covered my eyes with my fists and waited to wake up.

Panic jolted through me, I would wake up next to Maya and this would all be a dream.

I jolted awake, the room felt unfamiliar. The air was thick and smelled of antiseptic.

I was in a sterile room, I was just in a local hospital, I thought. This was all a dream.

A man in a white coat came along. "How are you feeling Thomas."

"Where am I? Where's Ellie and Ethan and Elara and I NEED TO SEE MAYA." I shook his shoulders.

"You're in a hospital, Thomas, we have been treating you for schizophrenia." He said gently.

That didn't register.

"I want to see Ellie, Elara, Sam, Ethan, Ellie, Tia, Silas, Max, and Silas!".

"WHERE ARE THEY?!" I screamed.

"They're not real Thomas."

The world tilted, and his words hung.

"The only family you've got is your ex-wife Sienna, you have been fighting for your kid, Ava... remember? You've been here for a year Thomas, the court case has stopped, temporarily."

He left the room.

I was all alone.

They were all fake, a shadow, a hallucination. All in the world of my cruel mind. And just as I was falling asleep. Tia.

"Are you still awake, dad?" And a scream followed. A cold, dark, empty, scream.
