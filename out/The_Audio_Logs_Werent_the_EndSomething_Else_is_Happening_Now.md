The Audio Logs Weren’t the End—Something Else is Happening Now


Audio Log 001: The Recorder

[Click. A new voice—calm, cautious, but with an edge of uncertainty.]

“Uh, this is… I guess this is my first log. 

January 25th. My name’s Alex.

I don’t even know where to start. It’s been a week since I found Nathan’s audio recorder in that cabin. I wasn’t looking for it. I was out hiking, came across the place by accident. Or maybe… maybe not.

The recorder was just sitting on the table, next to a box. I didn’t open the box—I don’t know why, but I couldn’t bring myself to touch it. I just grabbed the recorder and got out of there.

At first, I thought this was some kind of joke. The logs, the creature, the ‘pull.’ It sounded insane. But now… now I’m not so sure. Because things have been happening. Strange things.”

[A pause. Alex exhales shakily.]

“It started small. Weird dreams. A pressure in my chest. A feeling like I’m being watched, even when I’m alone. And the scratching… God, the scratching. I thought it was mice in the walls at first, but it’s not. It’s something else.

I don’t know why I’m recording this. Maybe it’s to keep myself sane. Or maybe I just need proof. For when this thing finally catches up to me.”

[Click.]

Audio Log 002: The Box

[Click. Alex’s voice is quieter, like he’s speaking in a small, enclosed space.]

“January 27th. I went back to the cabin today. I couldn’t stop thinking about the box. I know I said I didn’t open it, but… it’s like it’s been calling me. Like I had to go back.

The cabin was just like I left it. Cold. Empty. But the box… it was different. It looked older somehow, like it had been sitting there for years instead of days. And the smell—it was faint, but it was there. Rot and ash.

I opened it this time. Inside, there was… a bone. Not like any bone I’ve ever seen. It was long and thin, carved with spirals and symbols. They were… moving. I swear to God, they were moving, twisting, crawling beneath the surface.

I don’t know why I took it. I didn’t mean to, but I couldn’t stop myself. It felt warm in my hand, like it was alive. I wrapped it up and brought it home. And now… now I think I’ve made a mistake.”

[A faint scratching sound is audible in the background. Alex doesn’t acknowledge it.]

“I can’t get rid of it. I tried burning it, burying it, even throwing it in the river. It always comes back. It’s in the box again now, under my bed. And the pull—it’s stronger than ever.”

[Click.]

Audio Log 003: The Clearing

[Click. Alex’s breath is labored, his voice filled with tension. Snow crunches underfoot.]

“January 29th. I followed the tracks today. They were outside my house, leading into the woods. Same as Nathan described—long, deep, like something heavy was dragging itself through the snow.

The tracks led me to a clearing. I think it’s the same one Nathan found. The trees are dead, the ground’s bare, and the smell… it’s worse than I imagined. Like death and chemicals, like something rotting and burning at the same time.

And the bones… they’re everywhere. Scattered in spirals and circles, just like Nathan said. But there’s something new.

There’s a pattern carved into the ground, bigger than the others. A spiral, at least ten feet across. The dirt is black and cracked, like it’s been burned into the earth.

When I got close, the buzzing started. It wasn’t a sound—it was inside me. My head, my chest, my hands. It felt like I was standing on the edge of something… huge. Something alive.

I ran. I didn’t want to see what was coming, but I know it’s not going to stop.”

[A faint hum grows louder in the background before the recording cuts off.]

Audio Log 004: The Shadows

[Click. Alex’s voice is frantic, trembling. The sound of footsteps pacing on a wooden floor is audible.]

“February 1st. I can’t stay here anymore. The scratching’s getting louder. It’s on the walls, the windows, the ceiling. Last night, I saw shadows moving outside. They weren’t people. They were too tall, too thin. And they don’t walk—they… glide.

I’ve been keeping the lights on, but it doesn’t matter. They’re closer every time I look.

And the bone—it’s glowing now. Faint, but I can see it. The patterns are pulsing, like they’re alive. I can’t sleep. I can’t think. It’s in my head, whispering, pulling me toward the box.

I think… I think it wants me to take it back to the clearing. But I’m afraid of what will happen if I do.”

[A loud crash startles Alex, followed by silence. When he speaks again, his voice is barely audible.]

“It’s inside. I don’t know how, but it’s inside.”

[The recording cuts out abruptly.]

Audio Log 005: The Spiral

[Click. Alex’s voice is hollow, resigned. The faint hum from earlier logs persists in the background, growing louder as the recording progresses.]

“February 3rd. I… I don’t think I have much time left. The pull isn’t just a feeling anymore. It’s in my bones, like a magnet dragging me toward the clearing. I tried leaving—packed my things, got in the car—but the engine wouldn’t start. And when I looked back at the house, I saw them.

They were standing in the trees. Watching. Waiting. I know if I run, they’ll follow me. Maybe they’ll follow me anyway.”

[The sound of footsteps pacing stops, replaced by the faint creak of a chair. Alex’s voice softens.]

“The bone… it’s not just a bone. It’s part of something bigger. A piece of whatever’s out there. I think it wants me to bring it back, to complete whatever it’s building. But I don’t know what happens after that.

Maybe this is how it starts. Maybe this is how it spreads.”

[A long pause. The hum intensifies, distorting the recording slightly. Alex’s voice drops to a whisper.]

“I’ve been seeing things. Shadows in the corners of my vision. Spirals carved into my skin when I wake up. And the worst part… the worst part is, I think I’m starting to understand the patterns.

They’re not just carvings. They’re instructions.”

[Another pause. When Alex speaks again, his voice is trembling.]

“I can’t stop it. Whatever it is, it’s already inside me.”

[The hum grows louder, warping Alex’s voice. There’s a sharp static burst, and the recording cuts out.]

The logs end there. I found the recorder in the clearing, sitting on top of a freshly carved spiral in the dirt. There were no footprints, no sign of Alex, just the faint smell of ash and rot lingering in the air.

I took the recorder with me, but I haven’t listened to it again. Not since that first time.

The spirals started showing up a week later. On my walls. My skin. Everywhere I go, they’re waiting.

I don’t know what it wants, but I know something Alex and Nathan didn’t.

There is no escaping it.
