It all started the day we found Charlie’s sister in the barn.



Erica had returned to our little town from the city to celebrate her 27th birthday. She was sporting a nose ring and had choppy black hair. She had brought her boyfriend Blake with her, with his long black hair and dark wayfarers. Charlie and I were 14 at the time and thought they looked like rock stars.



Their parents had arranged a party on the grounds of their property. Charlie and I had our first taste of alcohol that night and coughed our guts up when Erica and Blake let us take drags of their cigarettes.



“I love you, Chaz,” said Erica, her arms around Charlie and me. “You too, Glen. Promise me you boys will do whatever makes you happy.”



We had no idea it was her way of saying goodbye.



The next day, there was confusion in the house when Erica and Blake were nowhere to be seen. They’d spent the night in her old bedroom. I’d spent the night on Charlie’s bedroom floor.



“Did you see your sister leave?” asked his mom. We hadn’t. She wasn’t answering her cell either.



Later that day, Charlie and I went to the barn to look for Erica. When we opened the doors, we saw her lying in the arms of Blake on a bed of straw. We put it down to too much vodka.



“We found them,” yelled Charlie. “Wake up, sleepy heads!” As we got closer, we saw an empty bottle of vodka, along with a small empty pot for high-strength sleeping pills, the kind for prescription only.



“Erica,” said Charlie, shaking his sister. She was out cold. “Glen, she’s not breathing!”



Blake started to stir like he was in pain.



“Mr and Mrs Morgan!!” I screamed, running out of the barn.



Erica and Blake were rushed to the hospital. As feared, Erica was dead at the scene. Blake had his stomach pumped and was put in a ward to recover.



“She wanted this,” he managed through god knows what other drugs they had put him on.



“What the fuck do you mean,” said Erica’s dad, grabbing Blake by the front of his smock. He had to be escorted out in tears along with his wife. I sat with Charlie until my parents could come pick me up. We just stared at Blake, this guy who we had thought was so cool, pale with greasy black hair plastered to his face.



“She got in, dudes,” he said.



“”What did she get in?” said Charlie, close to tears. “My sister is dead.”



“But she’s with them now.” He looked up. “Morrison, Joplin, Hendrix…”



“Who are you talking about?” I said.



“Only the greatest to ever live. The 27 Club.” He stepped out of bed, wincing, pulling out the tubes in his arms. I still remember the trickles of blood running down his wrists.



“What the hell is The 27 Club?”



“Strictly members only,” he said. “No admittance to anyone even a day before or after turning 27. I turned two weeks ago, and we were saving it to go together. Forever 27 with the legends.”



He walked to the window. “Say, what floor are we on?”



I shrugged. “Sixth I think.”



He looked out and turned with a grin. “I bet she’s up there partying with Cobain as we speak.” He opened the window,



“Blake,“ said Charlie. “I think you should get back in bed.



“Forever 27 boys,” he said. “See you in a few years.”



He leapt from the window, making Charlie and I cry out in unison. We heard a gruesome thud as he hit something hard. When I braved a peek, he was face down on the roof of an ambulance.



After the events, Charlie became obsessed with “The 27 Club”. When we turned 16, he wanted to form a suicide pact. We would wait until we both turned 27, then end it together.



“These people meant nothing to you,” I said. “When did you ever talk about The Doors, or Jimi Handrix? And everyone has those fucking Nirvana T-Shirts. it means nothing!”



“It’s not just that, Glen,” he said. “It’s honoring my sister. You loved Erica too.”



“I did, but she had problems, Charlie. It’s not even a real club. It’s not a conspiracy. It’s not some amazing club where they’re all living it up in paradise. They're unfortunate coincidences. Plenty of other cool people have died at 26, or 28.”



Before I could react he pulled out a pen knife and sliced open my right palm. I screamed.



“Jesus, what the fuck Charlie!”



He did the same to himself, barely reacted to the pain, then gripped my hand in his.



“Forever 27. We’re bound by blood now, my brother.”



“You’re fucking crazy,” I said, leaving his house. My hand kept slipping on the handle bar of my bike until I got home to patch myself up.



Some years passed, and I’d kept my distance from Charlie. I started college and got a new circle of friends. I remember July 23rd 2011 like it was yesterday. I was 21. Even before Charlie texted me, I knew he would as soon as I heard the news.



**Amy Winehouse is dead. She was 27.**



The scar on my right palm began to ache. I wasn’t going to contribute to crazy, so I ignored him. I met with my girlfriend Lori and our group of friends for a night out. Of course, Winehouse was the topic of the evening. She had managed to become a cultural phenomenon in such a short amount of time, and her death was genuinely hard hitting. And what better way to celebrate the life of a tortured soul than by keeping the drinks flowing and partaking in the coke our friend Shane had scored.



“Are you guys familiar with the concept of the 27 club?” asked Lori. I swallowed my whisky and cleared my throat.



“Yeah, that’s an exclusive group of celebrities who croaked it at 27, right?” said Shane.



“Exactly,” she said. “Anyone who’s anyone is part of that club.” She held up a glass. “To Amy, and the 27 club!”



“Here here,” said Shane. “May she forever shoot up with my idol, Kurt Cobain, in that big club in the sky.”



“That’s a bit insensitive,” I said. “She literally died hours ago. Have some respect.”



“I’m respecting, buddy,” he said. “This is all for her.”



“Are you OK, Glen,” said Lori. My palm was burning. I ran a finger over the scar and held it up to them.



“I never told you how I got this,” I said. “My childhood best friend, Charlie. His sister killed herself when she was 27. Her boyfriend, too.”



“Shit,” said Shane.



“Charlie did this to me when we were 16. He cut my hand and made us blood brothers. He wanted me to make a suicide pact, that we would end it at 27.”



“Glen, I had no idea,” said Lori.



“I pushed it away,” I said. “I cut all ties with him. But he texted me today, funnily enough, on the day the 27 club gets a new member.”



“I feel awful,” said Shane. “If I’d known, I wouldn't have…”



“Look, it’s fine,” I said. “I’m all for celebrating life or death. I guess I’m just being sensitive. It kind of all came back.”



A few more years passed. Lori and I were married and had a baby boy, Jack. We lived in a house not a million miles away from where I grew up.



One week, I was feeling particularly agitated, and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. I realized what it was when I spoke to my mom on the phone.



“Will you be seeing Charlie for his birthday?” she asked. “I know you boys don’t see each other as much as you used to, but you were inseparable once upon a time. I hear it’s the big two-seven. He could probably use the support, what with… well, you know.”



“I’ll message him,” I said before saying goodbye. I didn’t want to be a prick, so I kept it polite.



*Hey Charlie, I wish you a happy birthday. Maybe we can meet for a drink sometime soon. I’m only like two hours away from our old town. Love, Glen.*



About an hour later, I got a notification.



*Glen, my brother. Thank you for the birthday wishes. I hear you have a little one of your own now. Me too! Little Joseph. I would love to meet for a drink sometime. You stay in touch. Love, your friend Charlie.*



What was most surprising about it was that he didn’t mention his age at all. There was no “I’m 27 now, and you know what that means…” Years of guilt hit me like a sledgehammer to the teeth. I had neglected who was once my most important friend due to an admittedly messed up experience, but clearly one he could have used more support with. I had abandoned him. The scar on my hand burned as if to remind me of the wrong I’d done to him.



A few days later, I reached out again. I suggested we meet at one of our old haunts, but he invited me to his home on account of watching his son. He was still based in our old town and had a nice but modest house.



“Courtesy of the ‘rents,” he said. Charlie’s parents had done rather well for themselves and owned several properties around town. “I’d like you to meet someone.”



There was a basket perched on a wooden frame, and out he pulled a baby wrapped in a blanket. His little eyes were half open.



“This is Joseph. Say hello to your uncle Glen.” He handed Joseph to me, who I awkwardly cradled in my arms until I found the right position.



“He’s the spit of you, Charlie,” I said, looking down at his cute little face. He reached up and grabbed my nose with his sharp baby nails. “Forgot how much that stings,” I said. “Jack is currently enjoying his terrible twos. He’s a bit of a handful for Lori and myself at times.”



“Come sit down,” he said. “How is the old ball and chain?”



I laughed. “She’s actually perfect. I can’t recall a single disagreement we had, other than what to name Jack. She wanted to name him Donald after her grandfather. That wasn’t going to happen.” He laughed. “Where’s your better half, anyway? I don’t think we ever met.”



He looked down. “Suzie. She’s no longer with us. It’s just little Joey and me.”



“Charlie, I’m so sorry.”



“It wasn’t long after his birth. She just didn’t wake up one morning.” He smiled. “We disagreed about his name, too. I wanted to name him Joseph after Joseph Merrick, more commonly known as “The Elephant Man”. He was the first official member of the 27 club.”



I took in a deep breath as I felt unease set in. “Charlie, you can’t still be obsessed with that club.”



He reached over and took Joseph from me. “Did you hear Anton Yelchin is also a member now? Don’t try and tell me it’s not real.”



“Okay, I’m gonna leave you to it,” I said. “Charlie, promise me you’ll look after yourself and Joseph. You know where I am if you need any help.”



“Appreciated,” he said, laying Joseph down in the basket. “Say, isn’t your birthday coming up soon?”



I gulped. “Yeah, in a few weeks. Lori and I are having a weekend in the Hamptons.” I lied.



“Ah, good for you,” he said. “I hope the weather holds out for you.” He held out his hand palm side up, clearly showing me the scar we shared. “Put it there, brother.”



I firmly yet quickly shook his hand and made my way out of his house.



“He’s still not right,” I said to Lori later that evening. “It’s been over 10 years and he’s still obsessed with that fucking club.”



“Try to be more sensitive, Glen. He lost his sister, and now his wife too. As well as raising a baby on his own. The poor guy is probably so lost right now.”



“I’m trying, Lori. But that little reminder of my birthday didn’t sit right with me. It was like *‘remember what that means’*. The thing is, it means nothing to me. I didn't agree to a damn thing! I didn’t ask for this scar!”



She kissed the top of my head. “I’m putting Jack to bed, then taking a bath. Why don’t you listen to one of your podcasts? Take your mind off things.”



“Good idea, honey,” I said. “But not before the tickle monster attacks!” I grabbed Jack and blew raspberries on his belly, which sent him into fits of giggles.



“Okay, that’s enough excitement for one day,” said Lori.



“Give me a hug,” I said to Jack. “Goodnight buddy.”



“Night daddy,” he said, then disappeared upstairs with Lori.



I put in my earbuds and started listening to the latest "How Bizarre" podcast. I was content for all of ten minutes when I started thinking about Charlie.



I opened Google and typed in Charlie Morgan, followed by our hometown. One of the first results was from a local newspaper. The headline was something like “\[Redacted\] man becomes single father after sudden tragedy.” It mentioned his wife Suzie had passed away from breathing complications during sleep. My heart skipped a beat when I read she was 27 at the time of death. I then started to groan as my scar burned as if freshly cut.



I knew in my heart Charlie was responsible for Suzie’s death. I was turning 27 in just over two weeks. I called my mom.



“You sound agitated, sweetheart,” she said. “What’s the matter?”



“Why didn’t you tell me about Charlie’s wife?”



“I did! I mentioned how he’s had a rough go of it in life, but you didn’t seem to be interested. Too occupied with childish rivalries or whatever you call it.”



I felt terrible. “I’m sorry, mother. Did you attend the funeral?”



“I did. Don’t worry, I mentioned how busy you were and you would have been there if you could.”



“Mom, do you think there’s any chance Charlie knows where we live?”



“Would that be a bad thing? You *were* best friends, after all.”



“Can you just answer me, please?”



“Yes, he knows where you live. Was I not supposed to tell him during his crisis? Should I have read your mind?”



“No, no. I’m sorry, mom. I’m not mad. Look, Lori and I are thinking of going to the Hamptons for my birthday weekend. Would you be able to have Jack?”



“You mean I get to spend the whole weekend with my little Jackie boo?”



That was a 100% yes. When Lori came downstairs after her bath, I grabbed her. She let out a little yelp.



“You haven’t made plans for my birthday, have you?”



“No, not yet. I was thinking of having everyone over for a BBQ, bouncy castle for the kids, bucking bronco for the big kids.”



“How about we get away, just the two of us. Go to the Hamptons and rent a romantic cottage on the beach.”



“How bourgeois,” she chuckled. “Should we rent a garish Lamborghini too?”



I laughed. “If you want? My folks have already said they’ll have Jack for the weekend.”



My birthday came around on a Friday. That morning, Lori drove Jack to my parents’ while I finished packing our weekend bags. Lori has already specifically picked out some fancy dresses to show off to the “douchebags who summer in the Hamptons”. I think she was looking forward to seeing how the other half lived, and making snide remarks behind their backs. I was also in charge of collecting our neon green Lamborghini, which got the whole neighborhood snooping as I pulled it into our driveway.



After an hour or so, Lori hadn’t returned. I just assumed mom and dad were chewing her ears off, so I gave her a call. It went straight to voicemail. so I called my mom instead.



“Is Lori still with you?” I asked. “We kinda need to get on the road.”



“No, sweetheart. We haven’t seen Lori yet.”



My heart dropped. “She left over an hour ago.”



“Oh, my. Maybe she stopped for gas or something.”



“For an hour?”



“Don’t snap at me, Glen. There could be traffic. I’m sure she’s fine.”



“You’re right, I’m sorry. I’ll keep trying her cell. Please let me know when she gets to you.”



My stomach was in knots as I hung up and tried Lori’s cell again. Three hours of calls and texts later, nothing. I kept checking local traffic news to see if there was congestion, or god forbid an accident.



“Mom, I’m so worried,” I said, calling her back. “Do you think I should call the police?”



“Oh sweetheart, I don’t think they’d do anything after a few hours. Stay positive.”

My mind kept going to Charlie. It was my 27th birthday, after all. I dialled his cell.



“Glen,” he answered. “Happy Birthday, my brother,” I could hear the rumblings of an engine in the background.



“Is this a bad time?” I asked. “Are you driving?”



“Oh no, it’s the perfect time. I’m not driving. But hold on, I’ll just put you on to the driver.”



After a few seconds, I heard her.



“Glen, we’re okay. We’re driving to…”



It was Lori, but she was cut off short. “Okay, that’s enough.”



“What the fuck have you done, Charlie,” I spat down the phone. “You bring my family back now!”



“Do you know how kind your wife is?” he said. “She saw me on the side of the road and stopped to give me a ride. Such a sweetie. She told me all about your little birthday getaway and, well, I had to insist on being there myself. I couldn’t miss your 27th after all.”



My stomach was in knots. “Please Charlie. Please bring them back to me.”



“I think you should come here,” he said. “We'll be at the cottage in around 3 hours or so. I heard you have some wheels of your own. Sounds like you’ll be travelling in style.”



“Charlie,” I pleaded. “I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry for your sister. I’m sorry for abandoning you. Please, just come back to me. Let’s talk about it man to man.”



“You’ll either be there, or not. But if not, I’ve got another little friend who would love to make acquaintances with Lori and Jack.” I heard a *click*.



“He has a gun, Glen,” said Lori.



“I’m coming. Just don’t hurt them, Charlie. Please. I’m coming.”



“Good. Oh, and no police and all that shit of course. You know how it goes. See you later, brother.”



He hung up. I inhaled a sharp breath and screamed into the house. The first thing I did was collect the handgun we kept on the top shelf of our bedroom closet. Then I went downstairs and spotted a handmade birthday card from Jack on the kitchen counter, with a cupcake next to it. You could see Lori’s influence in the words as she had guided his little hand with a paintbrush.



*Happy Birthday to the best daddy in the world*



I fought back the tears, shoved the delicious cupcake into my mouth, and got into that ugly assed Lamborghini, putting my foot down and raising my middle finger at the neighborhood watch who shook their fists at me.



It took me 4 hours to reach the cottage in the Hamptons we’d rented on Airbnb. I put the gun down the front of my pants and walked inside, my heart ready to explode. I was greeted by the smell of rich tomato sauce. Lori was sitting at a dining chair, her hands strapped to the sides with thick twine. Charlie was standing over the cooker, stirring a saucepan. I could see a playpen with Jack sitting up playing with toys, and baby Joseph was lying on his back, waving his arms around.



“I’m here,” I said, making my presence known. Lori went from looking terrified to mild relief.



“Oh, I heard that god-awful car pull up,” said Charlie. “Half the neighborhood probably did. You’re just in time. I made pasta.”



“Thanks and all, but I’m not hungry.” I went straight over to Lori. “Are you hurt?”



She shook her head. “No, honey. I’m fine. Jack’s fine, too.”



I kissed her and went over to the playpen. Jack giggled when he saw me, holding up a plastic dinosaur. Joseph clung on to a plush toy of a blue dog.



“Don’t they look so cute together?” said Charlie. “Brothers from a different mother, just like us.”



I pulled the gun from my pants and turned to face Charlie. “You’re not the Charlie I called my best friend for years. You need help. This obsession has gone on long enough. Tell me, did you kill your wife?”



“What?” said Lori from the table.



Charlie grinned. “I forget how clever you are. You were always the brains, helping me with homework and stupid math tests that mean absolutely nothing.”



“I loved you, Charlie. But this is too much. So I’m taking my wife, and I’m taking my son. I think under the circumstances we’ll be taking Joseph, too. I sincerely hope you get the help you need so one day he can have a relationship with his dad.”



I walked over to Lori, but she yelled out “Wait!”



Charlie started to laugh. “Did you think it would be that easy? Just look inside her blouse.”



I peeked inside and saw an electronic device strapped to her chest. It had a numerical display that was counting down. There were 46 minutes remaining.



“If she moves from that spot before the timer runs out, a shot of adrenalin will be pumped into her heart. We’re talking about an insane amount of adrenaline. Enough to knock out an elephant. She simply won’t make it.”



“What do you want from me?” I yelled.



He walked towards me and took the gun from my hand, putting it on the table. Then he held up his scarred palm and held it against mine. That burning sensation came back.



“I want us to share a bottle, then live up to our pact.”



“But I didn’t make the pact!” I screamed. “You forced it on me.”



“Come on, Glen. We owe this to my sister and to Blake. To Basquiat, Winehouse, Morrison, Cobain, Joplin. To all those legends.”



“You’re insane,” I said, pushing him against the wall.



“Careful. All it takes is one little click, and Lori’s heart goes *boom*! And little Jack and Joey will be left orphans.”



“You’re actually going to take your own life with your baby boy right there?”



He nodded. “I’ve been committed to this since I was 14 years old. If you do exactly what I say, Lori lives. She can take Jack and Joey and be the hero of the story. Now, I checked your birth certificate. You were born at 21:19, which is when you’ll officially turn 27. Lori’s heart device will become useless at 21:30, at which point she can wriggle out of those ropes and get out of here. But not before we’ve taken a special concoction I’ve made to honor my sister.”



My legs went weak, and I had to sit down on the floor. “You actually want me to end my life with you?”



“Forever 27, Glen. You’ll thank me when we’re living it up.”



“Don’t do it, honey,” said Lori.



“Yeah, that’s not an option,” said Charlie. “You see, if he refuses, I’ll put a bullet in his head. Then I’ll watch as your heart explodes.”



I started to cry. I felt so weak, so powerless. But I think the worst thing of all was that Charlie was my friend. We’d been estranged for years, but he was my friend.



“May I kiss my wife?” I asked.



“Of course, I’m not a monster.”



I stood up and walked over to Lori, gently hugging her. I could feel the metallic device against my chest as I kissed her.



“Don’t do this,” she said, tears streaming.



“I love you, Lori. Look after our boy.”



I went over to the playpen and picked up Jack, who looked so oblivious to everything.



“Dadda,” he said, gently patting my face.



“I love you, Jack,” I said, kissing his cheek. He wiped his cheek like it was the most disgusting thing he’d experienced. “Look after mamma.”



I reached down and stroked little Joseph’s face. “I wish things could have been different for you, little one.”



“Alright, we get it,” said Charlie. “Outside, now.”



Despite the disturbing situation I found myself in, the night was beautiful. A dinner table had been set up on the deck behind the cottage. There was a bottle of whiskey and two glasses. The moon was low, the temperature mild, the sounds of the ocean gentle. It was supposed to be me and Lori, enjoying a meal and maybe a spot of love making on the dunes like we were teenagers again.



“Sit down,” he said. “I’ve waited weeks for this. I almost did it without you, but my scar burned like a motherfucker. Do you ever get that?”



I shrugged as I sat down.



“Yeah, you do. It’s because we’re connected.”



He poured two whiskeys and pushed one towards me. I didn’t hesitate, downing it in one go, shuddering a little at the afterburn.



“That’s good shit,” I said.



“It’s gotta be the best,” he said. “It’s a 10 year old single malt.”



I pushed out my glass for another, which he obliged.



“Suppose I’d better catch up.” He downed it and checked his watch. “21:15. Now’s as good a time as any.”



He pulled out a glass vial from his pocket containing a clear liquid. “This is a highly concentrated mix of Zaleplon, Valium, Klonopin, and ethanol.” He opened it and poured half into my glass, and the other half into his. “The beauty is we’ll probably be asleep before any of the nasty side effects take hold.”



I took a deep breath and downed some whiskey straight from the bottle.



“Gimme that,” he said and did the same. He then pulled out his gun and placed it on the table. I could feel tears streaming down my face.



“You were my brother, Charlie,” I said. “How could you do this to me?”



“Because I love you,” he said. “You and I, forever 27. I can’t think of anything more beautiful than that.”



He looked at his watch again and beamed. “21:19. It’s officially your birthday, Glen. Welcome to 27! Oh, how I’ve waited for this.”



“Please, Charlie. Think of Jack. Think of Joseph. He needs his daddy.”



He picked up the gun. “Drink it.”



I picked up the glass and swirled the clear mixture around. The smell was like pure alcohol. Then I looked to the sky, the moon, the stars, and the ocean.



“To Lori and to Jack,” I said, downing the mixture. It burned like freshly boiled water as it went down, making me clutch my throat. As soon as it reached my stomach, it was like a suckerpunch to the gut. I stumbled off the chair and fell to the ground, clutching my belly.



“I’m coming, brother,” said Charlie, picking up his glass. But before he could take a sip, a gunshot sounded out. I heard the glass smash on the ground and had enough time to see a single trickle of blood drip down his forehead before he collapsed. Then I passed out.



A week later, I was awake in a hospital bed. It turns out my wife is a genius. She figured out that if she could force something between her chest and the adrenaline shot, she’d be able to move freely. So, while Charlie and I were sitting outside, Lori freed her hands (Charlie was no expert when it came to knots, apparently) and wedged a dinner plate against her chest. When the device activated, it shattered the plate, causing a small cut to her chest, but otherwise leaving her unharmed. She then used my gun, which Charlie had left on the table to shoot him in the head.



It wasn’t a fatal shot, though, just enough to render him unconscious. He was being kept on a different floor in the hospital. On the day of my release, I went to see him. He had tubes coming out of his arms, mouth, and thighs. Despite what he’s put me through, it gave me no pleasure to see him that way,



We’ve become temporary guardians to Joseph Morgan, Charlie's son. Though we’re fighting for custody. Charlie’s parents, who are his next of kin, are really too old to be looking after a baby. We always said we wanted two kids, and he’s as sweet as pie. Jack has taken a shine to him, too.



Charlie remained on life support. There was always a police officer sitting outside his room, but  I visited regularly. He could sometimes communicate with his hands and eyes. Speech was usually slurred. But I know in my heart he used every fibre of energy left in his body to communicate with me on one special day.



The day before he turned 28.



I was reading “Of Mice and Men” to him. It was a book we’d studied at school and had meant a lot to us at the time, having got us both B grades on our assignments. Mid speech, I was interrupted by his hand on my wrist. He gripped it tighter than I thought he could. I looked into his eyes, my breath frozen. They were wide. Pleading. There were already several birthday cards dotted around the room reminding him of what was about to happen.



“Ple…” his lips parted to try and speak. I could see tears forming in his eyes. I put the book down and leaned closer.



“Charlie, what is it?”



“Glen… you have to…”



I knew what he wanted to say. “Charlie, please don’t ask that of me.”



“Please!” he said. “Forever… 27.”



I looked around the room. It was empty, but the door was open. A cop was sitting outside like usual. I stood up and slowly closed the door, wedging a chair under the handle. I went back to Charlie.



“Are you sure?” I asked.



He lifted a trembling hand to my face and nodded. “I’m sorry, Brother.”



I started to cry as I kissed his cheek. Then I found the mains plug, pulling it out of the wall. I held his hand as he started to convulse, and alarms started sounding through the halls. The cop was knocking on the door, trying to force himself in. By the time the cop and two nurses had got into the room, Charlie was dead.



His parents took me to court. I spent six months in prison before the judge dismissed the case.



Charlie got his wish; he became a member of the 27 club. I hope it’s everything he wanted it [to be](https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoBloodbath)

  
Edit: For those who don't understand why I did what I did, Charlie was my best friend for a lot of years.  One final act of kindness felt right to me, regardless of what he'd done to me. I wouldn't even want to see my worst enemy kept alive with wires and synthetic breathing apparatus.
