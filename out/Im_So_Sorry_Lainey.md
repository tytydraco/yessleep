I had no reason to kill Lainey. She did nothing wrong. She was, like, the perfect person. Everyone wanted to be like her. Maybe that’s why I killed her. She got on my nerves. A lot. And everyday at work it was always the same thing.

“Good morning!” She’d tell me cheerfully as she walked into the office.

“Good morning,” I’d say back, just to make her happy. I couldn’t stand to see her look sad. Even though I hated her, the sad look on her face when someone, specifically *me,* didn't say “good morning” back… it killed me. I hated it.

Me and Lainey had known each other since pre-k. We’d been best friends. But sooner or later this sort of "hatred" for her grew inside me. I’m not sure where it stemmed from. Where it found a place to plant its roots.

Maybe it was the fact that she made more friends than me. *Had* more friends than me.

Maybe it was the fact that talking, socializing, etc. came naturally to her.

Maybe it was the fact that she was a million times more successful than I ever was. Ever will be now.

Maybe it was the fact that she was better than me in every. Single. Way.

I’m not sure, but that "hatred" never went away. That "hatred" that stemmed from seemingly nowhere. I had to hide it. I didn’t want her to know how I felt. I *couldn’t* let her know how I felt. It’d kill her. Well, I guess it eventually did. Just not in the way I thought.

I need to hide her body. Her body that’s been in my fridge for almost a week now. The fridge that I haven’t been able to get close to, much less open, for almost a week now. Six days to be exact.

It’s been six days since I’ve killed her.

Everyday, there’s this guilt that tries to make its way up my chest and out of my throat. Trying to make me confess. Trying to make me admit to what I did to someone, *anyone*, that’ll listen. That’ll hear me out. That’ll let me confess my sins to them and *not* hate me for it. Not turn me in for it. Not snitch on me. I can’t tell anyone, though. Not a soul.

I’ve gotta get her out of here. She can’t stay. She’s gonna start smelling, and then people will wonder what the smell is, and I’ll have to explain that it’s just some rotten food, or a skunk, or something, *anything*, other than my dead best friend. Well, ex-best friend, I guess.

────────────

I pull her out of the fridge carefully, making sure not to make a mess. Not as much of a mess as possible anyway.

I’m not gonna be an idiot about this either. I’m interested in true crime. I took a forensics class in ninth grade, which was ten years ago, but still. I’ve had that knowledge stored away in the back of my mind since then.

Plus, I’ve seen the TV shows and movies where the main character kills someone and does a really crappy job at it. They always leave blood everywhere, don’t wear good clothes, don’t bury the person properly.

I just need to make sure I can do this without making a mess. Without making anyone suspicious. Most importantly, without getting caught.

I keep having to remind myself that I killed her for a reason. That it was a good reason. That she deserved it.

*But she didn’t deserve it.*

Yes, she did. She was annoying. She was better than me. Tried to rub it in my face by always being overly nice.

*But she wasn’t overly nice. That was just Lainey. She was a really sweet person, and she’d never rub anything in anyone’s face.*

It’s done and over with now. I just need to bury her, and this’ll all be over. It’ll be okay. I won’t get caught. I can go back to work, act concerned when everyone says something to me about her being missing, and then move on. Never think about it again.

*But it’s impossible for me to never think about this aga-*

Yes. It. Is. It’s simple. Never think of this moment again, never think of Lainey again. Never think, or speak, or anything, about any of this, ever. Again.

I carefully carry her out to the garage, laying her down on a tarp that I placed down on the ground. I stand there for a few seconds before I start to pace back and forth, trying to figure out a way to dispose of her. Burying her wouldn’t be the best option. It seems easier to find her that way. Burning isn’t the best option either, but I feel like it’d be better than chemicals. It’d be suspicious if I went out and just bought a bunch of chemicals. Maybe there’s a field or something somewhere that no one’ll see…

That’s when it hits me. Lainey’s house. I could use that. She just so happens to live out in the country, where no one would be able to see me doing any of this. It’d be perfect. I could place her back in her home, then set it on fire. It’d look like she was killed in the fire. Maybe. It’s worth a shot anyway.

I wrap her up in the tarp, placing her in the trunk of my car. I try my best to be quiet, since it’s eleven o’clock at night, but with the tarp it’s not that easy. I manage to do it, however, before I turn the air in my car on, quickly run inside to clean up some. I should probably grab some gloves or something too.

I clean up the fridge, the rest of the kitchen, and the living room, somewhat anyway, before packing a change of clothes and some gloves into a random tote bag I grabbed from my bedroom floor. I make my way back out to my car, getting in the drivers side. I shiver. It’s gonna be cold, but I have to keep her body from rotting as best as I possibly can. It *is* the middle of summer after all.

Driving out to Lainey’s house, that guilt starts trying to rise out of my throat again. I try to push it down, but it’s coming up as bile.

*This isn’t right. I shouldn’t be doing this. I should turn myself in. They’re gonna catch me sooner or later. What’ll I do then???*

It’s getting harder and harder to keep down now. Soon it’ll be impossible. I need to throw up, and luckily I was already at her house. I run inside as quickly as I can, throwing up in her kitchen trash can. After I’m done, I start looking around her kitchen, her living room. I walk to her bedroom, slowly remembering all the childhood memories we had here. This was her childhood home, the one she grew up in. Her room’s exactly the same as I remember…

I shake my head, trying to rid my mind of all the nostalgia. I’m getting rid of her body, not remembering “the good old days”. Suddenly, tears spring to my eyes, falling down my cheeks before I even realize they’re there.

I can’t keep doing this to myself. To Lainey especially. She probably still loves me, even after I killed her. She probably still thinks of me as her best friend.

I can’t do this.

I have to turn myself in.

Or kill myself.

Either one’s okay with me.

…

I stand there for a moment, in the middle of her bedroom, thinking.

I walk back out to my car, grabbing her body from the trunk. I don’t bother worrying about being quiet, or keeping things clean. I just wanna get this over with.

I lay her down on her bed, fixing her body to look like she was sleeping. She looks oddly pretty. I don’t mean in a weird way, either. She just looks so peaceful. I shake my head once again, walking back out to my car. I grab the two jerrycans of gasoline that I brought with me, lugging them inside. I start to douse the house in the gasoline, tears falling from my cheeks and mixing into the gas.

I’m not crying out of self pity or anything. I could never. I feel so guilty. I feel so bad. For Lainey, not me. I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn’t have killed her. I regret everything.

I finish with the gas, and I dig through Lainey’s kitchen for matches. I finally find some in the junk drawer of one of her cabinets.

I walk back up to her room, the matches in hand. I scrap one against the side of the box, holding it for a moment.

This is it.

I’m sorry Lainey.

I’m so, so sorry.

You were never annoying.

You were my best friend.

I don’t know why I ever hated you.

I don’t think I ever really did.

I love you.

So, so much.

I throw the match in the middle of her bedroom floor, laying down slowly. The heat burns my skin, and I start to cry even harder, but still not from pain. Just pure guilt. Soon, the pain from the heat, the flames, the guilt, everything, engulfs me, and I’m unable to move.

At least we’re here together.

I had no reason to kill Lainey. She did nothing wrong.
