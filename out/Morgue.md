I’m at my 4th year in nursing and I was training in a hospital with my batch mates. One night our instructor had finally told us how we can get extra credits (we were all desperate btw) she said if we can spend the night in the morgue (which was in the basement) she can give us that extra credit we’ve been asking.

Since I needed that credit I accepted her offer and decided to volunteer to be the first, I just wanted to get it over with.

It was about 8pm when they took me to the morgue, my batch mates and instructor wished me luck and gave me some advice before locking me in the dark creepy morgue. Bodies were everywhere laying on that metal table with white sheets over them, most of the walls surrounded with cold lockers containing bodies, except one side which had a large mirror that occupied the entire wall, a slightly bright light peeking in from a small window in the upper walls allowing me to see clearer at night.

As traumatized and scared that I was, I began on thinking ways to entertain myself since I didn’t have anything when I came in the morgue. Desperate on finding a distraction I looked at the large mirror, deeply thinking of any way for me to calm down, then I suddenly started singing while looking at my reflection. Finally my fear started fading while I was sing my heart out, all the songs I could think of I sang in that mirror. Hours later it felt like I wasn’t even in a morgue, I could go for days.

The night has passed and it was almost 8am, I’m still singing. I felt a sense of relief when I heard footsteps approaching from behind the door. My instructor let me out and all my batch mates congratulated me.

One of my them asked me if I was scared, I answered, then they were shocked hearing my voice. They asked me “why is your voice like that?” I said “Oh I had been singing in front of the mirror the whole night, It relieved my fear” 

After that I can’t describe the looks on their faces, my batchmates and instructor have gone pale, chills were going down their spine. Terror etched across their face, eyes wide with a haunted vulnerability, revealing the silent scream of fear echoing within.

The words that my instructor whispered to me will haunt me forever, it would make this day the last that I step foot into this hospital. Never ever coming back again.

She whispered in my ear
“There was no mirror”

I walked in the morgue after and realized I’ve been only seeing half the room the entire time and there was two of the same sides. Turns out there was a superstition that mirrors are actually not allowed in a morgue.
(I still would crap my pants hearing this story to this day, it has been 3 whole years)
