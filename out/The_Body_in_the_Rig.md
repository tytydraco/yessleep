If you’re reading this, I need you to believe me. I know how it’s going to sound—crazy, impossible—but I swear on everything I have left that it’s real. Something is out here on the road with me. It’s watching me, stalking me, and I don’t know how much longer I can keep running from it.

I’m writing this because I need someone—anyone—to understand what’s happening. Maybe you’ll think I’ve lost my mind. Maybe you’ll think this is just some trucker’s tall tale, spun out of too many sleepless nights and too much coffee. But if you’ve ever felt like something was watching you from the dark, like there was a shadow just out of sight that didn’t belong there… then maybe you’ll believe me.

My name is Jack Turner. I’ve been driving rigs for almost ten years now, ever since my divorce. Long-haul trucking seemed like a good way to get away from everything—my ex-wife, the house we used to share, the memories I couldn’t stand to look at anymore. Out here on the road, it’s just me and the hum of the engine. No one to answer to, no one to disappoint.

At least, that’s how it used to be.

Lately, though… something’s changed. It started a couple of weeks ago—small things at first. Feeling like someone was watching me when I stopped at rest areas late at night. Seeing shadows move in my mirrors when there shouldn’t have been anything there. Hearing whispers on my CB radio that cut out as soon as I tried to respond.

I told myself it was just fatigue—too many hours behind the wheel, too little sleep—but deep down, I knew better. Something wasn’t right.

And then… then I found him.


It was a little past 2 a.m., somewhere on Highway 287 between Amarillo and the middle of nowhere. The road was dead quiet except for my truck rumbling along in the dark. That stretch of highway always gave me the creeps—too empty, too still—but tonight it felt worse than usual. Like the darkness itself was pressing in around me.

That’s when I saw it: a big rig pulled off to the side of the road up ahead, its hazard lights blinking weakly in the distance like they were struggling to stay alive.

Normally, I’d just keep driving. Truckers break down all the time—it’s part of the job—and most of us know better than to stop for strangers in the middle of nowhere. But something about this rig made me slow down.

Maybe it was the way it was parked—crooked and half-jammed into the shoulder like whoever was driving had barely managed to pull over before stopping. Maybe it was curiosity or guilt—I’d been helped out plenty of times myself when my truck broke down—but whatever it was, I found myself easing onto the shoulder and killing my engine.

The air outside was cold and sharp, with that faint metallic tang you get before a storm rolls in. My boots crunched on gravel as I approached the rig, its hazard lights casting everything in an eerie orange glow.

"Hey!" I called out, my voice sounding too loud in the stillness. "You alright in there?"

No answer.

I climbed up onto the step and knocked on the driver’s side door. The window was cracked open just enough for me to hear… something. A faint whispering sound, like static or wind rushing through a tunnel.

"Hello?" I tried again, leaning closer to peer inside.

That’s when I saw him.

The driver was slumped forward against the steering wheel, his head tilted at an awkward angle like he’d fallen asleep—or worse. His face was hidden by shadows, but even from here I could tell something wasn’t right.

"Shit," I muttered under my breath. "Hey! You okay?"

Still nothing.

I hesitated for a moment before pulling open the door. The whispering sound grew louder as it swung wide—like a radio stuck between stations—but there wasn’t any music playing inside. Just silence… and him.

The smell hit me first: sour and metallic, with an undercurrent of something sweet that made my stomach churn. The kind of smell you don’t forget once you’ve smelled it—the smell of death.

The driver didn’t move as I climbed into the cab, my boots sticking slightly to something on the floor that glistened faintly in the dim light. Blood? No… it was blacker than blood, thicker too, like oil or tar.

"Jesus," I whispered, reaching out to shake his shoulder gently. His skin was cold—ice cold—and stiff under my hand.

That’s when his head lolled back.

I stumbled backward with a yelp, nearly tripping over myself as his face came into view. His eyes were wide open but completely black—no whites, no pupils, just endless voids staring back at me. His mouth hung open too, frozen mid-scream as if he’d died in absolute terror.

But it wasn’t just his eyes or his expression that sent chills racing down my spine—it was what had happened to his skin. It looked… wrong. Cracked and splintered like old asphalt baking under a summer sun, with faint veins of glowing orange running through it like molten lava.

And then there were the symbols.

They were carved into his arms and chest—dozens of them—glowing faintly with that same orange light as his veins. Spirals, jagged lines, shapes that didn’t make any sense no matter how long I stared at them. They looked alive somehow—shifting slightly when I blinked as if they were trying to rearrange themselves into something legible.

"What… what is this?" My voice came out shaky as I backed away toward the door.

That’s when I noticed it: his logbook sitting open on the dashboard next to an old pen with dried black ink crusted on its tip. The pages were covered in writing—not neat rows of numbers or notes but frantic scrawls that spiraled across every inch of paper like a madman had taken over his hand.

And then one line caught my eye:

"It sees me."

The words were scratched deep into the paper over and over again until they tore through to the next page beneath them.

A low hum filled my ears as I stared at those words—a sound that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere all at once. My vision blurred for a moment as if something was pressing down on me, suffocating me without touching me.

I stumbled out of the cab gasping for air and nearly fell onto my knees beside my truck. The whispering sound followed me outside now—louder than before—as if whatever had been inside that cab wasn’t content staying there anymore.

I didn’t look back as I scrambled into my own rig and slammed the door shut behind me. My hands shook as I fumbled with the keys until finally—the engine roared to life.

The whispering stopped immediately.

For one brief moment, everything felt normal again—the hum of my engine drowning out whatever nightmare had just unfolded behind me.

But then… then my radio crackled to life.

At first, it was just static—a soft hiss that sent chills crawling up my spine—but then came a voice: low and distorted but unmistakably human.

"You shouldn’t have stopped."

If you’ve made it this far, I’m guessing you’re either curious or crazy enough to keep reading. Either way, I need you to understand something: I didn’t ask for this. I didn’t ask to be dragged into whatever nightmare I’ve stumbled into. All I did was stop to check on a guy who looked like he needed help. That’s it. And now… now my life is unraveling faster than I can hold it together.

After I found that trucker—after I saw his face, those symbols carved into his ski n—I thought I could just drive away and forget about it. Pretend it never happened. But you can’t unsee something like that. You can’t unfeel the way the air around him felt heavy, like it was alive and pressing down on me. And you sure as hell can’t ignore the whispers that followed me out of that rig.

I tried, though. God knows I tried.

For the first few hours after I left, I convinced myself it was just shock messing with my head. That maybe the guy had some kind of rare disease or… or maybe he’d been part of some weird cult. People do crazy shit out here on the road—you hear stories all the time. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t that simple.

The whispers didn’t stop.

At first, they were faint—just a soft hiss at the edge of my hearing, like static on a bad radio signal. But as the miles rolled by, they got louder. Clearer. They weren’t just noise anymore—they were voices. Dozens of them, overlapping and murmuring things I couldn’t quite make out. And sometimes… sometimes they said my name.

I turned off my CB radio, thinking maybe it was picking up interference from somewhere, but it didn’t help. The voices weren’t coming from the radio—they were coming from *everywhere.* From the hum of my engine, from the wind rushing past my windows, from inside my own goddamn head.

And then there were the shadows.

I started seeing them in my mirrors not long after I crossed into New Mexico—a flicker of movement here, a dark shape darting across the road there. At first, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me—too many hours behind the wheel—but then one of them got close enough for me to see it clearly.

It wasn’t human.

I don’t even know how to describe it properly—it was like a smear of darkness that didn’t belong in this world. Its edges were wrong somehow, like they were fraying or dissolving into nothingness. And its eyes… God, its eyes were just empty holes that seemed to suck in all the light around them.

It didn’t do anything—just stood there at the edge of the road watching me as I drove past—but its presence left me shaking so badly I had to pull over for a minute to catch my breath.

That’s when I realized this wasn’t going away.


The next few days were a blur of sleepless nights and mounting paranoia. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that trucker’s face—or worse, those shifting symbols carved into his skin. Every time I tried to eat or drink something, it tasted wrong—like ash or metal. And every time I thought about calling someone for help—a friend, a doctor—I stopped myself because… what would I even say?

"Hi, yeah, so there’s this thing following me and whispering in my ear all night long? Oh, and by the way, I think it might be turning me insane?"

Yeah. That’d go over well.

But then came last night—the night everything changed.


It happened at another lonely stretch of highway just outside Albuquerque. The whispers had been getting louder all evening—so loud that I could barely hear myself think—and the shadows had started appearing more frequently too. They weren’t just hanging back at the edges anymore—they were keeping pace with my truck now, flitting alongside me like predators circling their prey.

And then… then my headlights went out.

One second they were illuminating the road ahead like normal; the next they flickered and died completely, plunging me into total darkness. My heart jumped into my throat as panic set in—I slammed on the brakes and fumbled for my flashlight in the glove box—but before I could even turn it on… he appeared.

At first, he was just a silhouette standing in front of my truck—a tall figure cloaked in shadow with no discernible features except for two faintly glowing eyes that seemed to pierce right through me. But as he stepped closer into what little light remained from my dashboard display… his form began to shift.

The air around me felt heavier with each passing second, like it was pressing down on my chest. My flashlight trembled in my hand, its weak beam barely cutting through the oppressive darkness. The thing—*he*—stood there, shifting and writhing like a living oil slick, his glowing eyes boring into me.

Then his voice......

"Jack Turner," he said again, his voice a symphony of whispers and echoes. "You’ve been busy." 

I swallowed hard. My throat felt dry as sandpaper. "What… what do you want?" I managed to croak out.

He tilted his head, the movement almost birdlike, as if he were studying me from some strange angle I couldn’t comprehend. Then he let out a low laugh—a sound like gravel rolling down a metal chute. "Oh, Jack," he said, his tone dripping with mock pity. "Sweet, simple Jack. Always so quick to ask the wrong questions."

I froze, unsure how to respond. My instincts screamed at me to run, but my legs wouldn’t move. It was like they were rooted to the ground—or maybe I was just too terrified to try.

"You’re adorable when you’re scared," he continued with a grin that spread across one of his many faces—a grin that didn’t belong on anything remotely human. "All wide-eyed and trembling like a kid caught sneaking cookies before dinner." He leaned in closer, his shifting form looming over me like a storm cloud. "But let’s be honest—you’ve got bigger problems than crumbs on your shirt."

"What… what are you?" I stammered.

His grin widened impossibly, stretching across several faces at once until it looked like his entire body was smirking at me. "Oh, come on now," he said with mock exasperation, throwing up one of his many hands—or what passed for a hand in that moment. "You’ve already figured that out, haven’t you? Or did all those little whispers and shadows go right over your head?"

I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out. He didn’t wait for me to try again.

"I’m *that thing,* Jack," he said with a dramatic flourish, gesturing toward himself as if presenting an award-winning performance. "The bump in the night. The shadow in the corner of your eye that you pretend isn’t there." His voice dropped lower, colder. "*The part of you that knows better but ignores it anyway.*"

He straightened up again, his form shifting into something taller and more imposing as he loomed over me like a nightmare given flesh. "But if you’re looking for something more poetic," he added with a sly grin, "you can call me… an artist."

"An artist?" I echoed dumbly.

"That’s right!" he said brightly, clapping his hands together in mock enthusiasm. The sound echoed unnaturally in the stillness around us. "And guess what? You’re my next masterpiece!"

My stomach dropped like I’d just driven off a cliff. "What do you mean?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

"Oh, don’t play dumb now," he said with a roll of one of his many eyes—or maybe all of them at once; it was hard to tell when they kept shifting around his body like fireflies trapped in tar. "You’ve been feeling it already, haven’t you? The whispers? The shadows? That little itch at the back of your mind telling you something’s *wrong?*" He leaned in closer again until I could feel the cold radiating off him like an open grave. "That’s just the warm-up act."

I tried to step back, but my legs still wouldn’t move. "Why me?" I asked desperately.

"Why not?" he shot back instantly with a shrug that rippled through his entire form like liquid mercury. "You stopped when no one else would. You *looked.* And now…" He paused for dramatic effect before leaning in even closer until his face—or one of them—was inches from mine. "*Now you’re interesting.*"

I shuddered as his words sank in, but he wasn’t finished yet.

"Oh, don’t look so glum!" he said cheerfully, slapping me on the shoulder with a hand that felt far too solid for something so… wrong. "Most people go their whole lives without ever being noticed by something as important as me." He stepped back slightly and spread his arms wide as if addressing an invisible audience. "*Congratulations,* Jack! You’ve officially graduated from boring little nobody to star of your very own horror story!"

His laughter filled the air around us—loud and echoing and utterly devoid of warmth—and I felt my stomach twist into knots.

"But don’t worry," he added after a moment, his tone softening into something almost comforting—but not quite. "I’m not going to kill you… yet." He tapped one long finger against what might have been his chin if it weren’t constantly dissolving into shadow and reforming again elsewhere on his body. "No no no… That would be too easy."

He leaned in one last time until I could feel his cold breath on my face—if whatever came out of him could even be called breath—and whispered: "*I’m going to make you special.*"

And then he was gone.

One moment he was standing there in front of me; the next he dissolved into smoke and shadows that melted into the darkness around us like they’d never been there at all.

For a long time after that, I just stood there staring at the empty road ahead of me, my flashlight still clutched uselessly in my hand.

Special.

The word echoed in my mind over and over again until it didn’t sound like a word anymore—just some alien concept that didn’t belong in this world or any other.

Whatever this thing was… whatever it wanted… I knew one thing for sure:

I wasn’t going to survive it.

What the hell is happening?

I know that you people know about this kind of thing that's why I'm here. Does anyone have any idea what the hell that thing is and what it's talking about?

Please, I need help .......
