I’ve always been a romantic. Always always believed in true love. Always thought, hoped, wished, dreamed, that somewhere out there was the perfect woman for me. Call her my missing piece, my other half, my soulmate, whatever you want to call her…I always KNEW that one day I would find her, or she would find me, and together we’d live our own happily ever after. And I thought we HAD found each other. I thought my dreams had come true. Until…
 
This is hard to write, and I know some people will probably laugh at me about the whole thing, if they believe me at all. But what happened, what’s STILL happening, is all too real, and all too close to me. Ok, I guess there’s nothing to do but explain what has gone on. Maybe it’ll help warn someone else, maybe someone can help me, maybe it’ll be nothing more than an entertaining tale, but I have to do it anyway.
 
I met her online. On Reddit in fact. I won’t mention which sub, but suffice to say it was a relationship sub of sorts, one for lonely people looking to talk to each other. You see, despite my belief in love and romance and soulmates, I’ve always been shy around women, scared to make the first move because I always worry that I’m wrong. That there’s no interest in me, or that if there is, I’m going to screw it up somehow. I have also always been nervous because of my looks. I’m not attractive; at least I’ve never thought of myself as such. I’ve had a few in-person relationships, but they failed for various reasons. That’s what drove me to write a post about looking for someone to talk to and see how it went. I got a few answers, but nothing really major, until she answered. Chelsea.
 
Right from the first few messages we exchanged, everything clicked. Everything felt…right. Our interests aligned in many ways, and where they didn’t, they complemented each others. Our conversation, first through messages on Reddit and soon on a messaging app, was free and easy and relaxed, like we’d known each other for years. We shred our secrets, our regrets, our insecurities, everything. The chemistry was immediate and potent. We even agreed to kiss our phone screens at night to share a “good night kiss”. Things moved rapidly as we both recognized early on that this was a person we already liked and could love. We both confessed pretty early on that we had fallen for the other. Our messages got more and more deep and romantic, as well as intense and sexual. But we still could talk about ordinary, every-day things and feel just as excited about them.
 
Everything moved fast, and before either of us knew it, we were in what we considered a real and deep relationship. We messaged all throughout every day, called every chance we got, video chatted as often as possible. We exchanged pictures, videos, memes, songs, poetry, everything. And it was AMAZING. We both said it was the happiest and healthiest relationship we had ever been in. If we had an issue we talked about it and worked through it. If one of us had a bad day and struggled with mental health issues, the other was right there to pick up the pieces and help things get back on track. I never knew it could be so good. We were in love and determined that we had a future, one that included marriage and being together forever. 
 
Then one Thursday evening, a little more than a year after we had started talking, we said our goodnights as usual. Things had been a little strained the last few weeks, because she had suddenly received notice from her landlord that she had to move, and the stress of that and time it took were hard, but we had had a really good day and talked about things, and I felt like we were back in a good place when I went to bed. I woke up, excited as always to see if she had messaged me already or if I had beaten her to it. There was nothing there, so I said good morning and included some mushy thoughts about how I wished I was waking up next to her. Then I got ready for the day. Before I left my apartment, I checked and saw there was still no message, which was unusual, but I thought that she had probably been called in to work early and hadn’t had time to send anything back yet. I went about my day, checking the app periodically, only to still not receive anything. As the day wore on, I got more and more worried, as this was completely unlike her. She always messaged back, even if it was just to say that she was busy and we would talk later. I tried calling but got no answer.
 
As it got later in the day, I got even more worried. When it was bedtime and I still wasn’t getting any responses or answers, I worked myself into a panic attack. No sleep that night, but also no messages. The entire weekend was like that. I didn’t hear anything from her Saturday or Sunday, and when I called her phone it just rang and never went to voicemail. I started scouring online, trying to find reports of traffic accidents or violent incidents of any kind in her area, but nothing. I didn’t sleep much at all and by Monday morning I was so worn out and so worried that I genuinely thought I would have to go to the hospital. That’s when I finally, finally got a message from her. It was just a simple “Good morning, I hope you slept well”. Like nothing had happened, like we’d been talking all weekend. The relief I felt was immense, and I guess that’s why I didn’t notice anything off at first. I immediately messaged her back, and soon we were messaging again like normal, though she never said what had been going on over the weekend to cause her to not respond. Any time I tried to bring it up, she deflected. That should have been a warning sign, but at the time, I was still too relieved that she was okay to take too much notice.
 
The rest of the day continued like that, messaging back and forth, but something felt…different. Off. Wrong, even. It took me a little while to notice it, and I tried to chalk it up to something residual from whatever had kept her away all weekend, but it was definitely there. There was a stilted feel to her messages and to our conversations, instead of the usual easy flow. It almost felt like she was being very deliberate in what she was saying, or like she had forgotten her normal patterns and was trying to remember what she SHOULD sound like. That feeling only got more intense when we finally talked on the phone. It was just a quick call after she was off work, but it was obvious something was different. She spoke haltingly, pausing a lot between words or phrases, and had very little emotion in her voice. And beyond that, there was a subtle quality to her voice and speech, something I couldn’t identify but that made me feel…uneasy? Uncomfortable? Suspicious? Maybe all of the above. It was her, but it wasn’t her. I still tried to chalk it up to getting over the weekend, but for the first time ever, I was glad to get off the phone with her and say good night.
 
Over the next few days, the feelings I had got even stronger. Things weren’t the same, SHE wasn’t the same. She was trying very hard to act like everything was normal, but I knew her too well to be fooled completely. And beyond the subtle changes in voice and speech patterns, there were other things.
 
This is the part where I know I’ll sound crazy, if I haven’t already crossed that point. I started to, well, see things, and hear things. Little things at first—nothing major, but enough to raise the hairs on the back of my neck. At first, it was just a feeling of being watched, of someone looking at me or standing near me but just out of sight. It was worse when I was talking to her, but soon I had that feeling all the time. Then I started to hear things—the sound of soft footsteps behind me when I went out to my car, a scrambling sound like an animal walking through leaves, a light giggle from right outside my window, even my name being called when I was at the store when there was no one around to call it. I tried to ignore all of this, telling myself it was my imagination and stress and anxiety teaming up to do a number on me. But I couldn’t ignore the fact that it all started after her “missing weekend” and got worse at about the same rate as our conversations did.
 
After a few days I couldn’t deny anymore that something was wrong. Our conversations had become even more disjointed, stilted, awkward, and, finally, more than a little creepy. It seemed like everything she said was taken from something she had said before, like she was going back through our messages and pulling parts of them out to answer me, with no new information or words. Talking on the phone was worse; her voice started to send shivers up my spine while I listened to her try to sound like herself, trying to fake it. Worst of all were the video chats. Her face and body still looked the same, but there was something in her eyes—something that felt wrong, so so wrong. The way she looked at me…it more than worried me, it scared me. Whoever, WHATever was looking at me, it wasn’t her. Not anymore. After a couple of video chats, I couldn’t do it anymore, I lied and told her that my phone camera was broken and I couldn’t video chat. She didn’t seem too disturbed on the surface, but I noticed afterwards that the incidents of hearing things increased. It seemed like every few minutes I was hearing the sounds of someone or something that just wasn’t there.
 
That’s when I started to see her. Glimpses, flashes, at the store, when I went out to eat, at the park, even out of the corner of my eye at home through a window. At first, I wasn’t sure, told myself it couldn’t be. She lived in another state, and she would for sure tell me if she had come to visit. And if she HAD come to visit, she wouldn’t be playing these peekaboo games. But it started happening too often to not be true, to not be real. I was walking to my car to go to a friend's house for a game night, and I happened to glance across the street and caught a full view of her. I knew it was her instantly—the same curly brown hair, the same figure, same everything. But instead of feeling excited and happy at seeing her, my stomach turned. That sense of wrongness, of something being off, washed over me, flooded me. Before I really knew what was happening I was in my car and screeching my tires on my way out of the parking lot. As I glanced behind me I saw her…scrambling on all fours into the middle of the road, before standing up and staring after me. I almost crashed when she dropped back down and started to crawl towards me, but thankfully I just kept things under control.
 
My friends didn’t really believe me, why should they? They hadn’t ever met her, they didn’t know what she was really like, so they didn’t understand my horror and revulsion at seeing her—at seeing what I could only now think of as IT. They laughed and told me I was imagining things and this is what can happen in a long distance relationship. They agreed to let me stay at their house that night, but I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t, I kept expecting to hear footsteps, or scratching sounds at the window, or my name.
 
That was a few weeks ago, and since then, everything has gotten worse. I see it everywhere, in public, through the windows when I’m at home, everywhere. I tried to break things off with her, with it, through messages, but I think it only made things worse. Every night I hear sounds all around my apartment, I hear shuffling, hear my name being called in that voice that isn’t hers, and other noises, things I can’t describe and don’t want to know the truth of. I can’t sleep, can’t eat, can’t even go outside anymore. Every window I look at I can see it, waiting for me, grinning, gesturing to me. I don’t know what it did with Chelsea, if she’s still alive somehow or part of this...it, or why it’s come after me, but I have to do something. I have to stop it, have to get it to go away, to leave me alone, or else…I’m sharing this because my mind feels like it’s about to break. Every day I’m losing more and more of myself, every glimpse of it pushes me closer and closer to the edge. I’m slipping, and I don’t know how to catch myself or what will happen next. I need help, I need help, I need help.
 
Chelsea, if you’re somehow still out there somewhere and can read this, know that I will always love you

To everyone else, be careful. Be careful about what you do and who you talk to. Be careful.
