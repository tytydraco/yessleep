I Am a Serial Killer. I Have No Choice.

People always talk about nature versus nurture. What makes a person into a monster? Is it in their blood, their DNA, or is it the environment that shapes them into something unrecognizable? In my case, it’s both. My father was a serial killer. And now, so am I.

I grew up in a house of horrors, though from the outside it looked normal enough. A quaint, suburban home with a white picket fence and a well-manicured lawn. My father, the friendly neighborhood handyman, was well-liked by everyone. But behind closed doors, he was a monster. I didn’t know it at first. I was just a kid.

I remember the first time I saw him. Really saw him. I was ten years old. I had woken up in the middle of the night, thirsty and disoriented. As I made my way to the kitchen, I heard noises coming from the basement. Curiosity got the better of me, and I crept down the stairs, each step echoing in the stillness of the night.

What I saw will haunt me forever. My father stood over a bound and gagged woman, a twisted smile on his face. He didn’t see me at first. I watched in silent horror as he methodically tortured her, taking perverse pleasure in her pain. When he finally looked up and saw me, something changed in his eyes. He didn’t stop. Instead, he beckoned me closer.

“This is who we are, sweet girl,” he said, his voice cold and detached. “This is our legacy.”

I wanted to scream, to run, but I was frozen in place. He made me watch, made me understand that this was my destiny. From that night on, he started training me. Teaching me how to stalk, how to kill. He said it was for the greater good, that we were cleansing the world of filth. I believed him. I had no choice.

When I turned eighteen, my father’s reign of terror came to an end. He made a mistake, got sloppy. The police caught him, and he was sentenced to death. But before they took him away, he made me promise to continue his work. To carry on the family tradition. I swore I wouldn’t, that I would be different. But the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.

At first, I tried to lead a normal life. I moved to a different city, changed my name, got a job. But the urge was always there, lurking in the back of my mind. It was like an itch I couldn’t scratch, a hunger that couldn’t be satisfied. I fought it for as long as I could, but eventually, it became too much to bear.

The first kill was clumsy. A local drug dealer who had been terrorizing the neighborhood. I followed him home one night, my heart racing, my hands trembling. I remember the way his eyes widened when he saw the knife, the way he begged for mercy. I felt nothing. No guilt, no remorse. Only a sickening sense of satisfaction. My father’s voice echoed in my mind, urging me on, telling me I was doing the right thing.

Each kill became easier, the fear replaced by a grim determination. I learned to cover my tracks, to plan meticulously. I became a hunter of monsters, just as my father had been. But the more I killed, the more I realized that I was becoming the very thing I sought to destroy. A monster.

I tried to stop. I really did. But it was like trying to hold back a tidal wave with my bare hands. The urge would build and build until it consumed me, and I had no choice but to give in. The targets changed. At first, it was the scum of the earth – rapists, pedophiles, murderers. But soon, the lines began to blur. Anyone who crossed me, anyone who looked at me the wrong way, became a potential victim.

I started to lose control. The killings became more frequent, more violent. I would wake up covered in blood, with no memory of what I had done. I was spiraling, descending into madness. And there was no one to stop me.

One night, while hunting for my next target, I stumbled upon a man named Richard. He was a quiet, unassuming accountant with a wife and two kids. At first glance, he didn’t fit the profile of my usual victims. But something about him felt off. I decided to follow him, hoping to find a reason to justify what I was about to do.

Richard led a double life. By day, he was the perfect family man. By night, he was a predator, stalking the streets for vulnerable prey. I watched him for weeks, disgust growing with each passing day. He was meticulous, careful, always covering his tracks. But I saw through his facade. I knew what he was.

I finally tracked him to a seedy dive bar on the outskirts of town. The kind of place where the drinks are cheap, and the patrons are cheaper. I watched from a dark corner as he scoped out his next victim, a young woman who looked too drunk to know better. I followed him out as he led her to a dark alley behind the bar.

This was it. My chance to rid the world of another monster.

I crept up behind him, knife in hand, ready to strike. But just as I was about to pounce, Richard spun around, a cold smile on his face. He disarmed me in an instant, his movements precise and calculated. We struggled, our bodies crashing into the filthy walls, our breath coming in ragged gasps. His eyes burned with a manic intensity, a reflection of my own.

“You think you’re the only one, don’t you?” he hissed, a twisted smile spreading across his face. “You’re not special. There are more of us than you know.”

In that moment, I realized the horrifying truth. Richard wasn’t just a killer. He was like me. Raised in violence, molded by darkness. We were two sides of the same coin, bound by blood and fate. The realization paralyzed me, giving him the upper hand.

He overpowered me, pinning me to the ground. I expected him to kill me, to end my torment. But instead, he leaned in close, his breath hot against my ear.

“Welcome to the family,” he whispered, his voice dripping with malice. “My father taught me well, just like yours did.”

He let me go, disappearing into the night, leaving me broken and bleeding on the grimy pavement. I lay there for hours, my mind reeling from the revelation. My father’s legacy wasn’t unique. It was a virus, spreading from one generation to the next, infecting everything it touched.

Days passed, and I tried to return to my routine, but something had changed. I started receiving anonymous letters in the mail, each one more disturbing than the last. They detailed my movements, described my kills in chilling detail. At first, I thought it was the police, but then I noticed the handwriting. It was Richard’s.

Then came the texts. They would arrive at all hours, filled with threats and taunts. Pictures of me, taken from the shadows. He was watching me, stalking me. My phone would ring in the dead of night, the caller ID always unknown. I would answer, and there would be silence on the other end, followed by a low, menacing chuckle.

Richard was playing a game, and I was his prey. He knew everything about me, every secret, every fear. He knew how to get under my skin, how to make me doubt myself. The paranoia consumed me. I started seeing his face everywhere, in the crowd, in the reflections of shop windows. I couldn’t sleep, couldn’t eat. I was unraveling.

One night, I came home to find a package on my doorstep. Inside was a photograph of me as a child, standing beside my father. The message was clear. Richard knew my past, my lineage. He knew the darkness that ran through my veins. And he was using it against me.

I am a serial killer. I have no choice. It’s in my very DNA. My father made sure of that. And now I know there are others like me, people like Richard and I’ve never been so scared in my life. 

I don’t know what to do and I’m in too deep to get any legal help. I’m completely on my own and I don’t know how much time I have left.
