[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/16tp5es/if_you_find_an_old_n64_game_called_desert_war_do/)

I called the Palo Alto High School Library, where Ed had given a talk the day before his suicide. After several rings, a lady picked up. I introduced myself, telling her that I was a journalist working on a story about Ed Schumacher.

“Who did you say you are?” she yelled. “Speak up, will you? I can barely understand a damn word of what you are saying.”

She didn’t seem like the most pleasant individual, but she sounded ancient, which gave me hope that she would have been working at the library twenty years ago. I reintroduced myself.

“I still can’t hear you,” she shouted. “I may be in a library, but since you’re not, there’s no need to whisper.”

I told her who I was for the third time, practically shouting into my phone.

“No need to yell,” she said. “I’m not deaf. What do you want again?”

“Do you remember a talk by a man named Ed Schumacher back in March of 2002?”

“Oh, yes. I remember that fool quite well. I’ve been working as a librarian for 43 years, have hosted hundreds of authors, but that talk was the most memorable, and not in a good way. A few weeks before, a man who claimed to be his agent called the library, saying that he was representing a gentleman who had worked as an artist at a video game studio. Allegedly, this individual had written a book on his experiences and was interested in giving a talk at the library. I personally don’t like video games, think they are an utter waste of time, but I accepted, believing it would be of interest to our student body. We are in Silicon Valley, after all. Now, I’ll admit that I did not do my due diligence on him. But I had never been hoodwinked before, and it didn’t even cross my mind that the man might be a fraud.

“I scheduled the talk after school, at 3 pm. It was well attended, probably about a hundred students there. But no author. So we waited. And waited. I thought there might have been a mixup, but at 3:15, this man comes waltzing in, grinning from ear to ear like the Cheshire Cat. He was wearing some funny wizard’s hat, looked absolutely ridiculous. If you’re reading to four-year-olds, you can show up in costume, but not when you’re talking to high schoolers. And instead of an age-appropriate book, he had a stack of pages from a picture book. I know some teenagers and even grown adults read comic books and graphic novels, and I find that quite sad, but this man had an actual picture book. No one above the age of five, unless they have learning disabilities, should read them. Some ‘educators,’ and I use that term very loosely, say they’re fine for 7- and 8-year-olds to read, but that is a load of rubbish.

“And it wasn’t even a professionally published book, just a pile of loose pages. Absolutely inappropriate. I had half a mind to stop the train before it even left the station, but I decided to let him talk. Oh Lord, was that a mistake. He starts showing the pages to the kids and telling some insipid story. The illustrations weren’t even well done, looked like a 5-year-old had painted them. And, of course, the students start laughing, and I start laughing, but he doesn’t seem to mind, he seems to think that we are laughing at how funny his story is instead of how stupid it is.

“By then, I had heard enough. I interrupt and ask him why he is presenting a picture book to a room full of high schoolers. He says something cliche like ‘how kids of all ages would be able to enjoy the story.’ The students laugh at this and I think this was the moment the imbecile, and I truly believe he met the medical definition of the term, realized that the students were laughing at his stupidity. He starts crying like a baby. Imagine that. A grown man having a lachrymal episode in front of a bunch of kids.

“Now I try to wrap it up. I thank him for his time and am about to usher him out, but this one smart aleck raises his hand and asks him about the ‘amazing video games he’s worked on.’  He was clearly mocking him, but Ed stops crying, thinking someone’s interested in his work. He said that his brother had recently given him the best advice on how to make a great video game—that it should be unbeatable. No matter how many times a player tries, they will never be able to complete the final level. Said it was supposed to teach some valuable life lesson about how you can’t always come in first, how there’s nothing wrong with losing. But the kids start laughing at this, and the waterworks resumed. He ran out the emergency exit. Thank God he left on his own, thought I was going to have to call security to escort him out.”

“The man who called to set up the talk wasn’t Ed, was he?” I asked.

“Oh, most definitely not. Unlike Ed, that man had a hoarse voice, a smoker’s cough. But moreover, he sounded intelligent.”

I had learned two things from the librarian. The first was that Frank had arranged for Ed to be humiliated. The second, and most important, was that the game was unbeatable. No matter what I did, I would never be able to cross the finish line ahead of the skeleton. My only chance of defeating him was by finding Frank. But nothing the librarian had said offered any clues to his whereabouts.

“Did Ed mention anything about his personal life, maybe he had a cabin in the mountains, something like that?” I asked, hoping to obtain a lead.

“Nope, just introduced himself as Ed the Sorcerer and started reading. Stupidest moniker of all time if you ask me. Should have called himself Ed the Simpleton.”

“You said that he mentioned he had received some advice from his brother. Did he mention anything else about him?”

“Not a thing.”

“Do you remember Jason Statler? Was he the kid who asked Ed the question?” I asked, trying to identify a motive for his killing.

“He wasn’t. Don’t remember who it was, but it wasn’t Jason. Before he disappeared, I couldn’t have picked him out of a lineup. As a librarian, I know two types of kids: the scholars and the troublemakers. Jason was neither. The police found his body a few days ago, next to a hat like the one Ed wore. Strange, don’t you think?”

“It is.”

“I’ve got a theory on it. Do you want to hear it?”

“Sure.” I suspected that her theory would be pure cockamamie, but there was a very slight chance that what she was going to say would prove valuable.

“I’m going to be long-winded, please forgive me, but it is necessary to provide some background information. As you probably know, Palo Alto is one of the safest places in California. The local newspaper even prints blurbs about bike thefts, can you believe that? But some grisly murders have occurred here over the years. I grew up here in the ‘60s and ‘70s. My father was a professor at Stanford, name was Rupert Bell, have you heard of him?”

“I think so,” I said, even though I had no idea who he was.

“Well you should, he was the foremost Proust scholar in the world. Anyways, in ’73 and ’74, there were four murders—three of the victims were young women, one was a young man—on and around the Stanford campus. The most famous case was that of Arlis Perry. Her body was found in the chapel, an ice pick embedded in the back of her head. There was lots of speculation going around, some thought that they were related to the ‘Zebra’ murders—a string of racially motivated killings in San Francisco committed by a group of individuals who called themselves the Angels of Death. But no one really knew who—or what—was behind it.

“After ’74, the killings suddenly stop. Three of them were solved by DNA evidence in the past few years, but when Jason disappeared, they were all open. So people thought that Jason’s disappearance was related to them, they hypothesized that the killer may have been imprisoned for the past 30 years or so for some unrelated crime but was back out and on the hunt again.

“I was sure there would be more disappearances, but there never were. Till this past week. Two more kids have vanished, and there will surely be more. I think they are all related—the ’74 killing of Arlis Perry, the death of Jason Statler, and the recent disappearances. In 2018, a DNA test linked a security guard to Perry’s murder. But I don’t think he acted alone. There are theories that the Son of Sam killings in New York and those of Charles Manson are all linked to her death. And I believe them. Some Satanic cult is behind this. And Ed was part of that cult. That’s why he wore that hat—because he was a devil worshipper. What do you think?”

“Ma’am, do you think if Ed were a Satanist, he’d cry because some kids laughed at him?”

“Um…”

I hung up on the old lady. I had grown up in the 80s, during the height of the Satanic Panic, and was well aware of how ridiculous it all was. Ed was almost certainly not a Satanist, but I had previously learned that Frank had an interest in the occult. There was almost certainly no link between him and the killings in the 70s—he would have been a kid then—but could Jason and the other kids have been killed as ritual sacrifices? It was possible.

I could speculate about motives all day, but it would do me no good. I needed to find Frank. And I needed to find him today.

\*\*\*

I drove to the San José Museum of Art, whose archives held Ed’s picture book. The museum hadn’t opened yet, so I waited outside, smoking a cigarette. I had been trying to quit for months, but after all I had been through, I needed a cig.

A few minutes after I arrived, a security guard walked out and asked what I wanted. After showing him my old press card and explaining that I was a journalist working on a story with a tight deadline, he escorted me inside to the office of some assistant curator. She initially told me that I could schedule an appointment to view the book next Thursday afternoon. My pleas about the urgency of the story fell on deaf ears, but after I offered to make a sizable donation to the museum her tune changed.

I was led down to a small reading room on the ground floor and was told that someone would be with me shortly. For an art museum, the space was rather plain. White walls without any decoration, linoleum flooring, and a single metal table with a chair and lamp. Reminded me of an interrogation room.

About fifteen minutes later, a college-aged girl walked in, carrying four 3-ring binders. I introduced myself.

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” she said, smiling. “My name is Mary Lin and I’m an intern here. So you’re writing a story about Ed, how interesting.”

I nodded. “He wasn’t very well-known in the gaming community, but he died a horrific death. I’m trying to piece together what led to his suicide.”

“That sounds fascinating. Macabre, but fascinating. As luck would have it, the museum’s putting on an exhibition of children’s book art next month, and two of Ed’s watercolors will be in it. First time any of his works will ever be on display. Been doing some research on him for it, haven’t found much though. Have you heard of Henry Darger?”

“He was some recluse who wrote this massive children’s book, right?”

She nodded. “Yeah, when I heard about Ed’s book and saw the illustrations, my first thought was comparing it to Darger’s. He penned a 15,000-page manuscript called *The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the Child Slave Rebellion.* I’m not joking, that’s its full title. Ed’s story is long, but Darger’s dwarfs it. Darger is considered the king of outsider art—art done by those without formal training. And the market for that type of stuff is red hot. Some of his watercolors have sold for over half a million at auction.

“But, unfortunately for valuation purposes, Ed isn’t an outsider artist. He attended art school for a semester in Oakland and worked his entire life as a professional artist. He could draw realistically—I’ve seen some of his other work—but in his untitled children’s book, everything is off: the scale, the perspective, the figures. Why he painted in this ‘naive’ style is the big question I’m trying to answer. And, near the end of the book, the style drastically changes. Instead of watercolors, he used charcoal to make these grotesque, macabre illustrations. Why he did that is my second question.”

“Have you found out anything about his personal life?” I asked.

“Not much, born and raised in Daly City. Had a twin brother named Frank, who also committed suicide. What have you found out?”

“A few things. Frank not only faked his death, but he drove his brother to kill himself.”

She gasped. “Are you serious?”

I nodded.

“Why would he do such a ghastly thing?”

I shrugged. “I’m trying to figure that out.”

“Well, if you do, please let me know. I’d love to include that information as part of the exhibit. Well, actually, maybe as part of another one, the picture book exhibit, as you can imagine, will be geared towards kids. Anyways, feel free to look at the binders. They didn’t come to us like that, just as a bundle of loose sheets. We put the pages in plastic sleeves, if you need to take them out, please ask me. I’ll be in the office next door.”

\*\*\*

After she had left, I undid the clasp of the first binder.  On the first page was the image I had seen on the museum’s website: a sandy-haired boy and girl on a swing set. Their figures were flat and their proportions were totally off. The girl looked like a dwarf—her head was much too big for her body—while the boy’s head appeared shrunken. On the bottom of the page, a caption identified them as “Alice (girl) and Aleister (boy).”

The next page showed the corner of a three-story Victorian mansion, with pale-yellow walls and maroon trimming. On the far right side of the house was a four-story octagonal tower with a conical roof.

Typically, when depicting a corner view, an artist would employ two-point perspective to create a sense of depth. The horizontal lines of the house would recede to one of two vanishing points on the horizon line—one on each side of the house. However, in this painting, the lines did not converge to a point on the horizon. They weren’t off by much, just slightly, but it wasn’t imperceptible. In addition, the house’s vertical lines, which should have been straight, were slightly tilted. Not more than a degree or two, but still noticeable.

Normally, I would have attributed this to a lack of skill, but having seen Ed’s other works, I knew this was a deliberate choice on his part. And these slight errors in perspective made looking at the page uncomfortable—more so than if the errors had been greater. There was nothing intrinsically frightening about the house—there were no cobwebs covering its windows or bats roosting under the eaves. In fact, it was familiar, reminded me of my grandparents’ Queen Anne-style home in Humboldt County. But Ed, with his slight tweaks in perspective, had created something uncanny—simultaneously strange and familiar. I wanted to look away, I wanted to flip the page, but I couldn’t.

I had a feeling, I can’t explain why, but I just had this intuition that Frank was in this house. I went out and asked the intern if she knew where it was located.  She said that she thought it was a fictitious house, a product of Ed’s imagination. I knew that wasn’t true.

I returned to the reading room and spent forty minutes searching online trying to find it, but had no luck. I must have flipped through thousands of Google image results, searching first for ‘yellow Victorian mansion with tower in Bay Area’, before replacing ‘Bay Area’ with ‘California’, before leaving the geographic qualifier out completely, but found nothing. It was a grand mansion—not some simple cottage—but I couldn’t find any trace of it online.

I started skimming through the binder, hoping to find some clue to the house’s location. The next ten pages showed the children climbing a circular staircase with slightly slanted stairs. The charcoal underdrawing was visible in these illustrations. It indicated that Ed had originally drawn the stairs level, before tilting them by a degree or so, some to the left, some to the right. Barely perceptible, but as was the case for the house’s exterior, enough to be unnerving.

The scale also changed between the pages. On some, Aleister was taller than Alice, on others, their heights were reversed. On some, they looked like giants climbing a Lilliputian staircase, while on others each step was nearly as tall as the children.

Finally, they arrived at the top of the tower. Against one wall was an impossibly tall bookshelf. As Aleister was climbing a ladder, trying to reach an immense tome on its top shelf (*Danmark* by Benjamin Thor Zilberman), the floor gave way. After falling in darkness for several pages, the children awoke on a forest floor, surrounded by singing gnomes and pipe-playing pixies.

There wasn’t much text—I think there were several 30-page spans without a single word on any of the pages—so the story was a little hard to follow, but the jest of it was that Alice and Aleister got transported to the land of Noosylvania—a magical kingdom ruled by a ‘benavolint \[sic\]  cow’, King Moo (even though he is male, he, for some reason, needed to be milked), and his consort, Queen Neigh, a unicorn with a neon horn. However, one day, the peaceable kingdom is invaded by an army of evil cane toads, led by the ‘dispicabul \[sic\] General Hoppy.’

Instead of doing battle with the cane toads, the siblings spent most of their time frolicking in the forest with jolly centaurs and dancing with elves on giant toadstools. Not much in the way of a story. And not much in the way of clues. I was sure that there was some secret hidden in the pages that would point to the house’s location, but I was having no luck finding it.

In the middle of the fourth binder, the story’s tone took a dark turn. Previously, with the exception of the mansion’s unnerving architecture, there wasn’t anything remotely scary. Even the colossal General Hoppy was more buffoonish than villainous. But after the children were magically transported back to the real world, everything changed.

Instead of watercolors, Ed began to use charcoal. Unlike the previous pages, where the children looked flat, like they had been cut out of paper, there was depth to them in these drawings. The first one showed the siblings standing in front of the uncanny mansion. On the next page, for no apparent reason, Aleister begins bashing his sister’s head in with a rock. This gruesome scene played out over several illustrations, red chalk utilized to depict Alice’s blood.

Then Aleister is shown inside, an icepick in his right hand. An icepick which he rams up his eye socket.The next illustration depicted a teenager sleeping in bed. I recognized him. It was Jason Statler. The museum didn’t purchase this book till May—one month after his disappearance. *It was Frank who drew the macabre illustrations.*

The next several pages showed Jason’s death at the hands of a skeleton in a sorcerer’s hat. Then there was an illustration of another boy in bed. Adam Kim. I was positive it was him. *Was Frank able to foretell his death? Or did he somehow magically insert these pages? Did it really matter?*

I kept flipping pages. The subsequent illustrations depicted the murders of Adam Kim and Ethan Greene—the most recent teen to vanish.

When I saw what was on the last page, my heart almost stopped. There I was, in charcoal, wearing the same exact clothes I had on now, cowering as the skeleton made his way towards me.

The figures on the page suddenly started moving. Transfixed, I watched as the skeleton walked slowly towards my illustrated figure, as he picked me up, as he bit off my head. Blood started gushing from the page. Real blood.

As I was trying to close the binder, a skeletal arm shot forth from the page and grabbed my right wrist. With my free hand, I tried to break the monster’s grip, to no avail.

As I was trying to free myself, another arm shot out. I barely had time to scream before it wrapped its bony fingers around my neck. As I struggled to breathe, I picked the metal lamp off the desk with my free hand and smashed it against the skeleton’s arm, but he held tight. Hit the arm again and again, but his hold on my neck just grew tighter.

I reached into my pocket and pulled out my lighter. For once in my life, I was glad that I hadn’t quit smoking. I flicked it and drew the flame towards the illustration. When it was less than an inch away from the paper, the skeletal arms receded back into the page.

A few seconds later, as I was gasping for breath, the door opened and Mary Lin stepped inside. “Is everything alright?” she asked. “I thought I heard a scream.”

I looked down. The blood had vanished, but my wrist was raw from where the skeleton had grabbed it. “Yeah,” I said, trying to sound calm. “It was just some video on my phone that popped up. I’m all finished with my research.”

“Hope you found what you needed for the story.”

\*\*\*

I hurried out of the museum and started driving home. On the way back, I listened to the news. The body of Ethan Greene, sans head, had been found in San Mateo. Besides some bruises, there were no injuries to his lower body. No indications of sexual assault.

Once I was back, I booted up my computer. I searched the California Property Records Database for any house that had been built between 1880 and 1920 and had been owned by someone with the last name Schumacher. None of those houses resembled the uncanny mansion. Kept expanding the date range little by little, tried alternative spellings of Schumacher, but had no luck.

Then I remembered the painting I had seen in Ed’s Daly City apartment. The one of him and Frank in front of the Modesto Arch. Modesto (affectionately known as Methdesto) is not, and was not, a tourist destination. I had been there once for a conference in 2004 and had no desire to go back. Heck, even Tacoma, Washington is more interesting. The only reason someone would go there would be to visit family.

I first searched for Victorian mansions in Modesto. There were only a few—most notably the 1883 McHenry Mansion—but none of them was the house from the book. Searched for Schumachers in the city and looked at all their houses on Google Street View. Again, no luck.

*It was probably owned by a relative on their mom’s side*. I had previously tried—and failed—to find the names of their parents, but I did know the siblings’ full names—Edwin Fox and Franklin Lawrence Schumacher. *Maybe Fox and Lawrence were family names, possibly one of them was their mother’s maiden name.* I searched for all Fox families in Modesto. No matches. Then on to Lawrence.

The fifth Lawrence in the results— a Miss Theodora Lawrence—had an address on 15th Street. Bingo! Unlike in Ed’s book, it was in a state of disrepair—the wraparound porch had rotted, the shutters had fallen off, and its front lawn was overgrown. And, some misanthrope had painted it black. Completely black, even the window panes were painted over. But there was no doubt in my mind—it was the house!

I Googled its address. The first result was its Zillow page. It had apparently been built in 1960 (well after the Victorian era, which explains why it had not appeared on any lists of historic homes) and had never been sold.

The second result was a letter some lady had written to the *Modesto Bee* in 2021, asking the city to condemn the “faux-Victorian house that is an eyesore darkening our community.” *Good luck with that lady, maybe that would happen in Sausalito or some other bougie town with an HOA, but not in Methdesto.*

The third was a 1970 article from the *Modesto Bee* (then known as the *Modesto Bee and News-Herald*):

**5-year-old Girl Killed by Older Brother**

*5-year-old Eusapia Schumacher was killed by her 8-year-old brother while visiting her cousins at \[redacted\] 15th St. in Modesto. The juvenile suspect, whose name is being withheld by police due to his age, was said to have been playing with his sister outside when he picked up a rock and attacked her with it. The victim’s mother, who witnessed the attack from the kitchen, ran out to stop it, but by the time paramedics arrived the girl was deceased.*

*The 8-year-old was transported to an asylum in Sacramento for evaluation. No motive…*

It was not mentioned in the paper, but I knew Frank was the killer. He had killed his sister, killed his brother, killed Jason Statler, killed Adam Kim, killed Ethan Greene, and, unless he was stopped, would kill me and many, many more.

I retrieved my handgun and embarked on the two-hour drive to Modesto, arriving at the house a little before five.  On my drive over, I had questioned if Frank would be here. But from a live oak tree in the front lawn, a skeleton was hanging. A skeleton wearing a green sorcerer’s hat.

Frank was here. And he was expecting me.
