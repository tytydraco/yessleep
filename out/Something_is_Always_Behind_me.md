For as long as I can remember I’ve had this feeling like someone or something was right behind me. Like that feeling you get when you reach the top of the basement stairs, flip the light off, and for that split second, in a wave of panic you get the hair-raising sense that something lurks in the dark behind you.

Growing up, circumstances like these would happen often to me, and as I got older they increased in frequency and intensity. Sometimes no matter where I was, or what direction I turned, I could just feel that something was there. By the time I’d reached high school, it was beginning to have an impact on my life – both psychologically and otherwise (I won’t bore you with the details) – so I began seeing a doctor to help me work through things.

Over time, going off to college and then starting out in the real world, I slowly got my neuroses under control, medication eased the sudden rushes of dread (Cymbalta worked wonders, by the way) and eventually was able to rationalize through and accept that such a feeling (I came to affectionately call it “my whisper on my neck”) is just one of those quirks of human experience that everyone has felt at one moment or another, and for whatever reason some part of my brain just glommed onto that, and I experience it more frequently and more intensely than others.

I’ve been living a happy, typical life, with very little to remark on. I have a solid job, love my husband, and we’re building a family. My daughter just hit 18 months old, and is just starting to really interact and communicate with the world around her.

And then last Thursday happened.

I was playing on the floor with my daughter, when I noticed her starting to look behind me, or seemingly through me, rather than at me. I didn’t think much of it until she began pointing, giggling and doing big “Ohhhhhhhs” like she was interacting with someone right behind me. The hair on the back of my neck raised, and in a flash that old sensation of something being right behind me, and that terror again came washing over me. I immediately tried to gather my composure, and channel my early days of getting past this, going through my mental techniques for rationalizing out of it and calming myself down.

But a moment later, when I thought I was gaining control, my daughter was looking behind me again and suddenly contorted her face, and started screaming a horrible, tortured, wail that was significantly beyond what I’d ever heard from her.

In the time since then, I can’t even be in the same room as my daughter without her looking just behind my head and screeching uncontrollably to the point she starts shaking and it takes my husband an hour to calm her back down. And I again feel it there, all the time, no matter where I am, what I’m doing or where I look, and I can tell it is very much not a fleeting wisp of my imagination.

My life has become an anguishing hell, as I’m losing my daughter and have gained a very unwanted companion. I am very scared, and have no idea what to do.
