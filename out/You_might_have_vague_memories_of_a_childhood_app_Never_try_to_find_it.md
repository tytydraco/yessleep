Recently, I found my old childhood iPad. I was packing for college and I was sifting through my desk drawers and just found it there, so I decided to take a little break and scroll through some old family photos. After I exhausted that, (which was pretty quickly afterwards) I remembered an old game I used to play incessantly, so much so my siblings literally staged a faux intervention. It had something to do with pirates and water and currency – It was a simulator, when you tapped on the screen and the waves would move, or moreso jolt back and forth. I don’t think I ever thought it was very popular, because whenever I asked one of my friends about it, they’d always look at me like I was insane. 

Eventually I found it, in one of those folders Apple automatically makes when you push two apps together. I didn’t remember ever making it, but I just chalked that up to me being weirdly forgetful at times. 8 years is enough to wash away the unimportant stuff. The folder was named quite cryptically – just an asterisk and a dash. It almost seemed like there were placeholder apps before it, as I had to scroll through it to even find it. I thought this was strange, it felt almost like I had done that purposefully, like I had something to hide. I told myself I was just being stupid and clicked on the app. The icon was a wave, not from any beach I’d ever seen. It swallowed the entire sky. It was grand, dutiful, and pristine. It was almost perfect. 

The only beaches I’d ever been to were those near the Jersey shore, where waters were usually murky and tasted like my cousin’s soggy two feet. The screen finally loaded, though it was password protected. I smiled. Finally something I remembered. When I was a kid, I only ever used two passwords. WoeIsGlee or JackRabbitKilledTheSparrow. I tried WoeIsGlee first. Error. JackRabbitKilledTheSparrow. Error. It was this horrible shade of red, which was a harsh contrast against the light blue haze of the load screen. 

I was about to put the iPad down, mom was yelling at me to pack my last two pairs of sweatpants and I didn’t feel like toggling around anymore, but I realized there was something else I could try. I slowly typed in an asterisk, and then a dash. It opened. I sighed at my initial obliviousness, but I wondered why I hadn’t just made my password one of the regular passwords. It was strange, and unlike me, especially me back then.

The first thing I saw was a chatroom, though the chat wasn’t currently being used, just an ongoing call. I frowned. I didn’t remember there ever being features like that. Before I had a chance to even process what I was looking at, I was met with a pop-up, asking whether or not I’d like to turn my video on. There didn’t seem to be an option to leave the call. I requested for it to be turned off.

It was six older men, but no later than their forties, laughing about something and coughing their damn lungs out while they did it. They didn’t seem to notice me till four minutes in, when I turned my mic on and managed a hello.

“The hell are you?” This bearded, reddish one asked.

“Uh, I found this app on my iPad.” I said, feeling a bit foolish now. I didn’t know why the hell I was here. I didn’t know what this was. I assumed they’d repurposed the app or something, but I couldn’t leave. Something in me didn’t want to. 

He smiled, and it was long and wide and knife-like, his teeth and eyes clamped down on me too, suddenly but slowly.

“Martin?”

How the fuck did he know my name?

My face went cold. “How the fuck do you know that?”

“Turn on your camera, I don’t believe it's you.” 

I almost laughed. “No, I’m not gonna turn it on, nutjob. What is this?”

“You know, I never thought you’d come back. You just forgot, one day, to come back.” He seemed almost upset. 

“We never talked, us and you, but we all watched you, Martin.”

I could not move my eyes. They were burned onto this man, burned onto his screen.

“I would’ve known if you were all on here. I’m not an idiot.” That was true. I was always a level headed kid.

“Well, it wasn’t always online. We watched you in the corners of your own world. Gave up when you got a bit older, lost track of you completely when you moved.”

I felt filthy. I didn’t want to believe it, and I still didn’t get it. Why me, what this was, if they were actually just screwing with me.

“And what about all the other kids? You did this to them too?”

“You were the only one ever on the app, Martin. It’s only user.”

I smiled knowing I’d finally caught him in a lie. “My cousins in Jersey used this.”

“No they didn’t, Martin. They lied to you. It was all you ever asked them about, so they lied to you. They couldn’t find it. One of its creators needs to physically install it on your device.”

 My stomach fell. 

“Then how was it on mine?”

He smiled, and then another man ended the call.

I haven’t opened the app since that day. I’m thinking maybe my mom found out about this around the time I used it somehow and the passcode protected the app, I won’t let me delete it either. I don’t know why she’d make the name of the folder the password, but maybe I messed around with that too. I don’t know, I just don’t remember anything.
