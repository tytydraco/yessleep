My name is Jacob, I'm a 13-year-old guy in eighth grade. I'm not your average Joe, as I'm autistic, which makes me different from other kids in my class. For some reason, some of them just can't accept that and try to bully me over it. Luckily, my father taught me at a young age to just ignore the bullies or give comebacks when I thought of good ones. Sometimes the comebacks work, and the bullies just do a fake laugh and leave me alone, but other times it doesn't work out that great, and the bullies get even more angry with me.  
  
Anyways, on Monday my mom woke me up wearing her favorite blue dress with flowers on it because there was a special meeting at her work that day. 'Wake up sweetie, it's time to get ready for school,' she said. I was in a bad mood because it was Monday and did not want to go to school. I never do, but this time I really didn't want to. I asked her if I could stay home, but she said I still had to go, even if I didn't feel like doing so. I got out of bed and got that weird feeling of derealization. This stayed for about 10 seconds, which is way longer than usual, so I got a little weirded out. I didn't care too much, though, so I just went downstairs and made breakfast for myself. After that, I packed my drink and lunch and got ready to go to school. I live about 5 minutes away from my school, so I hopped on my bike and rode to school.  
  
When I arrived, I greeted my friends, and eventually, we went to English class. On my way to class, I got another derealization moment that lasted about 5 seconds. I told my friends this was already the second time it happened today, and they thought that was weird too. When we arrived at the classroom, the teacher was late, so the bullies thought it was a good idea to start messing with me again. They started calling me fat, weird, and other overused terms. My friends got mad and tried to stand up for me, but I told them to leave it to me. I stood up, gave a comeback, and the bully got very mad. He tried to punch me in the chest, but I saw it coming and blocked it. Then he tried punching me in the face, which I somehow didn't see coming and so he hit me. The punch itself didn't hurt at all because he wasn't very strong, but it made me bite on my lip. I had another lip injury that was almost done healing, but because I bit on it, the wound opened again, and I knew I would have to wait another week or something for it to fully heal.  
  
After school was finally over, I went home and spent the rest of the day watching YouTube when my mom called for dinner. I was pretty hungry, so I was glad to hear dinner was ready. We had spaghetti for dinner which made me even happier because spaghetti is my favorite food. When I was done eating dinner, I wanted to get the leash to walk my dog when I got an extreme Déjà vu and was suddenly back eating the spaghetti. This weirded me out a lot, and I told my parents about it. My dad jokingly said I was going crazy, and I continued eating the spaghetti. This time when I was done eating, I got the leash again and actually walked my dog. When I was done walking the dog, I went outside to play football for about an hour with my friends and then go back inside to watch some more YouTube. After about 2 more hours, my mom said it was bedtime, so I said goodnight and got ready for bed.  
  
In the morning, my mom woke me up in the exact same way as the day before. Wearing the same blue dress, and saying the exact same 'Wake up sweetie, it's time to get ready for school.' I asked her if there was another meeting at work today, and she replied by asking me what I meant by "another" meeting. I told her that she had an important meeting yesterday too, and she looked at me like I was crazy and said she couldn't have because yesterday was Sunday. She laughed a little and told me to get up and get ready for school. I thought she was making a joke, so I got out of bed, dressed up, ate breakfast, and got ready for school again. I looked in the mirror to see if my hair looked okay, and I realized my lip was already almost healed. I thought that was weird, but I didn't care too much.  
  
I got on my bike, rode to school, and greeted my friends again. We talked a bit, and eventually went to History class. About halfway walking there, my friends went in a different direction, and I asked them where they were going. They said they were going to English class, and I said we have history, not English. They told me that history was tomorrow morning, not today. I looked at them weird and told them that English is on Monday morning, and history on Tuesday morning. They said that's true and asked me why I was going to history then. I said because it's Tuesday, and they looked at me like I was crazy and told me it's Monday. I thought I was going crazy but just followed them to English, and that was indeed the class we needed to go to. Again, the teacher was late, so the bullies tried picking on me again. They said the exact same as the day before, and I just completely didn't respond because I was so weirded out by everything. Lots of possible explanations were going through my head, but I came to the conclusion that I was in a time loop. I started panicking and faked being sick so I could go home again. That worked, and once I was back home, I started doing my research on how I could escape. After a few hours of researching and not finding anything, I decided to give up and just go to sleep.  
  
When I woke up, my mom was there, again in that dress, same words. 'Wake up sweetie, it's time to get ready for school.' I faked being sick again, and my mom believed it, so she let me stay home. I started researching more when I eventually found a website with exact instructions on how to get out of a time loop. These were the instructions: If you've found this website, you're probably stuck in a time loop. To escape the loop, you must follow these instructions. First, close your doors, windows, and turn your lights off. If it's day, make sure you block all light coming from the windows. There must be no light. When that's done, get yourself a clock. Doesn't matter if it's digital or analog, it can be any type of clock. Put it somewhere stable and start looking at it for exactly one hour. After 30 minutes of looking, you may start seeing, hearing, or even feeling things. Ignore them. They are not real. When the hour is over, you will pass out and wake up at the start of the time loop. When you wake up, and everything is back to normal, good job! You escaped the time loop. When you wake up, and it's still dark with the doors and windows closed, hide. You're not safe. It is coming after you. This will only happen when you didn't follow the steps correctly, so make sure everything is done correctly and you're completely safe. Good luck!  
  
When I read that, I was a little worried but still decided to do it, since I had nothing to lose. I closed my door, blocked all light from coming in, turned off every lamp, and then I got a clock and started staring. After about 5 minutes, I started to see the numbers twitching a bit. After half an hour, the numbers started vibrating aggressively, and I started hearing voices. This got more extreme as the time started to pass by. When the hour was almost over, I heard voices, saw shadows in the corners of my eyes, and even started feeling nails in my neck. When the hour was over, I passed out, and when I woke up every light was still out, and my door was still closed. Then it hit me. I forgot to close my window. I feel something behind me.
