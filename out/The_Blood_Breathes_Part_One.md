The barn was old. It rested in the center of a barren field. Nothing could be grown in the dirt here, and hasn’t for years. The only thing here was the decaying structure. The sun had worn the paint from bright
red to dull brown. The shingles hung loosely off the crooked roof. Their intense darkness attracted the heat of the sun. There was a large gap in the wall, and empty stables could be seen within. The large doors were tilted inward, and very little was visible beyond them. I can still envision every miniscule detail of that horrendous building.

I was running through the field, with Gary Kernel on my tail in a shiny new bike. We were playing a game of tag. I hopped over the rows where corn probably grew at one point in time. The dirt had a slight crunch to it from years of dehydration. Gary was too close; I had to run faster. Suddenly, I could hear a cracking noise behind me. I stopped and spun around. Gary was lying on the ground, covered in brown dust. He coughed.

I rushed over, “Are you okay?”
“No,” He groaned, “I fell off my stinking bike!”

I put out my hand and Gary swatted it away. “I got it,” He coughed and stood up. He stumbled forward and gripped onto my shirt. He screamed intensely in pain and I grabbed onto his shoulders. I looked down
at his leg, which was incredibly out of place. I couldn’t see the front of his foot, and looked back to
realize that it was facing the wrong way.

I had to stop myself from throwing up, “Oh my-”
“It’s fine,” Gary lied, “It’s fine.”
“I don’t know man,” I shook my head, “You might want to look at it.”
“I’m not going to look at it! That makes it worse!”
“No dude it’s, like, completely out of place.”
“Shut up.”

I shut up and walked forward. Gary leaned against my shoulder and hopped next to me. We made it to the barn after around two minutes. I could tell by Gary’s intense breathing that he was in a lot of pain,
but his face remained still. He was never one to display pain. In all our ten years of friendship, I had never once seen him cry. I shook my head, “Let’s just go inside so that you can sit down.”

We stumbled over to the large doors and pushed them open. They were heavy and slow. The inside of the barn was suddenly filled with sunlight and our shadows were highlighted as we entered. I helped Gary onto a small bale of hay that rested in front of a larger stack. He leaned back against
the yellow hay and winced in pain. I tried not to look at his leg as I looked around the barn. It was fairly open on the inside, with the stables taking up a decent amount of space on each wall. There was a ladder
in the back right corner that presumably led to the second level. 

We played in this barn all the time. Not once had we gone up that ladder. All the steps were broken through the middle. The one time that we tried, Gary fell off the side and was almost impaled by a pitchfork. The stable doors to my left were all splattered with something dark red. Gary liked to say that it was blood, but I told myself it was the same
paint used for the outside of the barn.

I sat down across from Gary and sighed. He tried to move his leg but instantly regretted it. He threw his head back and yelled, “My bike better not be broken!”
I don’t know why, but this comment made me laugh a little. I looked up and saw Gary glaring at me.

“You know that thing they do in movies?” I asked.
“No, Francis, I don’t know ‘that thing they do in movies’.”
“Where they wrap a stick next to the broken leg so that it stays straight.”

I stood up and walked over to the corner of the barn behind the ladder. I grabbed a shovel that looked like it had decayed from years of use. The tip was red with rust. I kicked the head of the shovel into the floor. It wedged between the boards. I placed my foot on the head and tugged. I tugged and tugged. Nothing happened. I pulled as hard as I could. The shovel gave way. I heard the wood splinter and I fell backwards onto my butt.

My vision focused again and I saw that it wasn’t just the shovel that broke. There was now a hole in the floor. I crawled over to the hole and peered through. There was a lower level, but I couldn’t see much. Light reflected off of something shining below. It almost looked wet.

Gary called from across the barn, “What are you doing?”
“I found something under the floor.”
“What is it?”
“I don’t know.”

I should have grabbed the shovel and went to help Gary. However, I felt an unreasonable urge to investigate the liquid beneath the floorboards. I wedged my hand into the gap and gripped onto the edge. I tugged my arm back, ripping a piece of wood from the floor. I kept tearing until there was a hole large enough for a child to fit through.

Gary limped over to me, using the stables as support. He sighed, “What’s going on?”
I moved backwards across the floor, “I don’t know.”

“Oh my! That smell is awful!”
I sniffed the air, but could not smell more than old hay. A slight sloshing noise could be heard echoing below our feet. I got back onto my hands and knees and pulled myself to the hole. I stuck my feet in first and dropped with my hands above my head. I dropped into the thick liquid. It splashed up around my body, lapping my cheek. 

It was warm. Not hot, but uncomfortably warm. It was like a hot tub with no bubbles. The liquid only went up to my belly button, yet I felt completely surrounded. 

I could only see a few feet in front of me with the little amount of light that was coming from the hole in the floor. I lifted up my hand so that it was no longer in the liquid and examined it. The liquid was red. A deep red, darker than blood.

Gary called down from above, “Holy crap!”
“Dude! It’s freaky down here,” I yelled back.
“Why would you do that?”
“I don’t know, it was, like, calling to me.”
“‘Calling to you? It’s blood.”
“I don’t think it’s blood.”
“It looks like blood.”
“Whatever, man. Is there a ladder up there?”

He looked behind him and around the barn. His head disappeared from view. I looked at the closest wall, and waded over to it. I ran my hand along the side. It was cold concrete. I pulled my hand back and turned around. There was nothing except the liquid down there. 

My curiosity was suddenly replaced with an intense dread. I backed up against the wall as my heart pounded. I could almost feel my chest heaving up and down with the beating of my heart. My breaths became short and harsh. 

The darkness of the room closed in around me slowly. I felt as if the room itself was getting smaller. My hands moved by themselves up to my chest, gripping at my shirt. I shook my head. Echoes of whispers filled bounced off the surface of the red and bombarded my ears. I slapped my hands onto the sides of my head, “Gary! Did you find a ladder?”

There was nor response. I asked again. Still no response. A dreadful moan escaped my mouth and I dropped to my knees. The liquid pressed against my sides, hugging me. It held me in place and whispered the disturbing, twisted thoughts directly into my ears. I plugged my ears, but it made no difference. The liquid needed to tell me. It spoke with rushed intensity. It had to tell me now, before I was ripped from its grasp. Right as I could not stand it any longer, something descended from the ceiling in the corner of my eye. I turned toward it and saw a moldy wooden ladder. It splashed through the liquid and made contact with the hard floor below. 

Gary called in through the hole, “I’ve got a ladder!”

I scrambled through the liquid on my hands and knees. I grasped desperately at the bottom steps of the ladder. The liquid begged me to stay as I crawled up the ladder. I felt it dripping off my clothes. I scaled the ladder in seconds and Gary helped me out of the hole. It was finally silent. The crisp breeze made me shiver. Gary stepped away from me, “We need to get home.”

I used a rope that I found on the door of a stable to wrap the shovel handle to the side of Gary’s leg. We walked the two miles back to our subdivision, where our houses were across the street from each other. I dragged Gary’s bike with my left arm, and helped him walk with my right.  We waved to Bumps, the stray cat that lived on our street. Gary was rushed to the hospital, and needed a cast. Our parents were upset, but Gary told them that he fell off his bike. When they questioned why I was covered in dark red liquid, I explained that I fell into a mud puddle. 

They seemed skeptical, but what else were they supposed to think? That I was covered in somebody else’s blood? Gary wasn’t at school on Monday or Tuesday. He showed up on Wednesday. His cast was signed by a total of six people: Me, his mom, his dad, Mrs.Bransteen, Don H, and Peter W. Gary had to use crutches to get around, and I helped him get his food at lunch. After school, my family went over to his house to have dinner. Our families have known eachother since we were two years old. 

Me and him were in his basement playing cards while our parents talked about something-I can’t remember what it was. Gary usually loved playing cards, but this time was different. He was off. I attributed it to the fact that he broke his leg, but even then I could tell that there was something more going on. I pushed the cards to the side after our game, “Does it hurt?”

He gave me a strange look, “What?”
“You’re leg? Does it hurt?”
“No.” He changed the topic, “Hey, what do you think that red stuff was?”
I hadn’t thought much about the strange liquid since we left the barn. I started shuffling our decks. “I don’t know,” I shrugged, “Maybe it was gas or something.” I looked up at him, “Why?”
“I had a dream,” He mumbled. I had to lean closer to understand what he was saying. He continued, “I was in the barn, and I could hear it sloshing under the floor. I climbed down there and laid in it. I floated on my back. It was holding me…”

“That's weird,” I responded. Something about the slow way he talked made my heart beat faster.

He chuckled, “I had the dream again last night. It told me that it could fix my leg. I want to go back.”

The cards exploded from my hands. I had applied too much pressure while shuffling. I cleared my throat, “I-I don’t understand.” I averted my eyes from his face. His eyes were wide like a child with a cookie dangling in front of their face. 

“Let’s go back,” He explained, “Tonight. It says that it’s better at night.”
“What said that? The blood?”
“You know it’s not blood.”
“Whatever it is, it can’t talk to you.”
He jumped to his feet, knocking his chair backwards, “You heard it too! You know that it can talk to you!”

I tensed up in my chair, my heart now pounding. He screamed louder, “Why don’t you listen to it? Why won’t you just listen to what it says? It wants to help you!”
I shook my head, “What are you talking about?”

I heard heavy footsteps descending the stairs into the basement. Gary’s father burst into the room, stopping at the entrance, “What is going on down here?”
Gary spun around, his eyes wild. He pointed at his father, “None of you understand!”

Gary was pulled out of the room and I was rushed out of the house.
I laid awake for most of the night. Gary wasn’t at school the next day, but he was back by Friday. He didn’t say a word to me all day. We got off the bus together after school, and he went into his house quietly. He was grounded. 

That night, my dad asked some more questions about what happened in the barn, but I just lied. I knew that it was wrong, but I was scared of that barn and I knew that I wasn't supposed to give away the secrets. My dad finally gave up and let me go to bed. I sat awake, staring at the ceiling. 

I couldn't help but think about Gary. He barely even saw the stuff under the barn, what was his sudden obsession? I finally drifted to sleep after around an hour, but woke up not long after. I looked around my nightstand for a water bottle. My hand finally found it, and I drank it eagerly. As I drank, I noticed a shadow on the wall. The curtains were open, letting in some moonlight, but something was blocking it. 
There were no trees outside my window. 

The shadow moved slightly and I began to panic. There was somebody outside my window. I reminded myself that the darkness heightens my imagination, but deep down I knew that this was real. I turned my head slowly towards the window. I nearly passed out when I saw his face pressed against the glass, watching. Snot was dripping from his nose and he had a hungry look on his face. I couldn't tell for sure who it was, but I thought for a second that it was Gary.

I jumped backwards and screamed. He didn't even flinch. He just backed away slowly. I got out of bed and walked over to the window. He was gone. In his place was only the smear of snot on the window and something laying on the ground outside. 
It was Bumps, his legs no longer attached to his body. They were gone. His face was shaved down to a flat bloody mess. His ears were gone, and so were his teeth. I gagged and stumbled backwards. My dad burst into the room and turned on the light.

“What’s wrong?” He asked. 
“There-there was somebody outside my window.” I began to cry. My dad brought me down the hall where my mom consoled me. He went outside and looked at the cat. He came in a few minutes later and gave me a hug. 

“There was somebody there, really there was,” I insisted. 
He patted my back, “I believe you buddy. I believe you.”
I didn't tell him that I thought it could be Gary, because I wasn't sure enough. 

That weekend, I stayed as far away from Gary as possible. I didn't have to try very hard because he stayed in his house all of Saturday. On Sunday, I saw him sitting on his porch at 8:00 AM. He had a lunchbox and a suitcase by his side. He sat there until noon, when he got up and started to walk away. He walked right past his house and to the end of the street. He continued right out of the subdivision. 

I ran inside and told my dad that Gary was running away. He called his parents, but they wouldn't pick up. He put me into the minivan and drove down the road. We followed Gary as he crossed the road into the wide open field surrounded by a thin row of trees. We pulled off the road and squeezed through a gap in the trees. We drove to the barn in the center of the field. We got there as Gary entered through the front doors.

“Gary,” My dad called, running through the doors. He wanted me to stay in the van, but I opened the door and followed. When I peeked my head through the doors, my dad was facing the back wall of the barn. I could smell it now. Gary was in the right corner, right by the hole in the floor. There was something in his hand, but I couldn’t quite make it out. It was small and white. It was moving, trying to escape. Gary’s hand tightened, and the movement ended with a quiet SNAP. 

I watched as Gary dropped
the dead rabbit to the floor. He kicked it into the gap in the floor. I could hear it splash below. My dad approached Gary slowly. I can’t exactly remember what he said to him, but Gary didn’t like it. His left hand wrapped around a pitchfork resting against the wall. He stepped towards my dad, who stepped backwards cautiously. I could hear the liquid beneath their feet. It was loud. It sloshed back and forth, getting faster each time. 

An ear-shattering screech emanated through the barn, shaking the walls violently. I dropped to
the ground, covering my ears. When I looked up, my dad had the rusted pitchfork embedded into his chest. He was coughing and gasping for air at the same time. It was the most awful sound I had ever heard. He crumpled to the floor, a puddle of blood forming around him. I ran to his side and dropped to my knees. He shook his head and opened his mouth. His lips formed the word, “Go,” but no sound came out. Blood dripped from the corner of his mouth as life faded from his eyes. Gary was sitting on the floor.

He looked up and made eye contact with me. He was suddenly and violently tugged backwards by an unseen force. He slid across the floor on his back. It was like a hidden magnetic was pulling him. He collided with the wall. He was pulled to the left, right into a cabinet of tools. Nails and miscellaneous tools rained from the cabinet, but one stuck out from the others- a shotgun. He grabbed it and stood up. He aimed it towards me. I ran across the barn as fast as I could and collided with Gary, knocking him to the ground. I grabbed the shotgun and held it by my side. 

He looked at me, both of us sitting on the ground. I saw tears begin to fall from his eyes. He grabbed my arm and made painful eye contact. He struggled to talk through his tears.

He said, “Kill me. Please…” He jerked backwards, and he gasped for air. His bones twisted and moved on their own. He was forced to stand up. He lifted the pitchfork from the floor and made eye contact with me again. This time, his eyes were empty. The only sign of humanity were the streaks of tears down his face. 

I lifted the shotgun up with shaky arms, trying to steady it. I closed my eyes and shot it. The sound of the gunshot was loud, but the sound of the body crashing to the ground was harder to hear. I slowly opened my eyes and gazed upon the body laying limply. My head was pounding with an indescribable pain.

The police showed up a little bit later and asked me so many questions yet I can't remember a single one. I told them everything I could, but at that point I just wanted to leave the barn. They looked through the hole like I said. They said that there was nothing down there. They were stupid. Idiots, all of them. They brought me home and told my mom that her husband was dead. She locked herself in her room and cried for hours. I just made myself a sandwich and sat In the kitchen staring at it. 

The police went across the road to Gary’s house to talk to his parents. I watched them from across the street as two bodies were taken out on stretchers. From what I've heard, his parents were found in horrible conditions. They were both missing their arms and legs as well as some chunks of flesh. All of these parts were found in Gary’s suitcase. 

I had tried to put all of this into the past, until recent events had brought it back to the forefront of my mind.
