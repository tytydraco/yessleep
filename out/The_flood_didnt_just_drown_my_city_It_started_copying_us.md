After my father died, I stopped trusting time.

Days didn’t feel like days anymore. The sun was just a pale stain behind gray clouds, and the water below didn’t move like water. It dragged itself through the streets slowly, thick with trash and bodies, as if it were thinking.

I stayed on the rooftop because going down meant death. Not from the flood. From the people who survived it.

I learned what survivors sounded like.

They didn’t shout for help. They didn’t call out names. They whispered. They moved carefully. They watched rooftops the way stray dogs watch meat.

But the first thing that truly scared me wasn’t a survivor.

It was my name.

I heard it that first night when the city finally went quiet enough for me to hear my own breathing. I was sitting with my back against the wall, pipe across my lap, eyes wide open because sleep felt dangerous.

Then, from somewhere below… a voice whispered:

“Arav…”

Soft. Close. Like someone leaning in.

My whole body went cold. I spun around so fast my neck hurt.

No one was there.

Just broken concrete, a collapsed water tank, and the satellite dish we had used to keep my mother’s body from drifting away. The wind pushed the smell of the flood up into my face, salt, rot, plastic, something metallic that made my mouth water in the worst way.

I told myself it was grief.

People hear things when they’re alone.

But grief doesn’t use your name like a knife.

The next morning, I climbed to the highest corner of the rooftop and looked across the city. Mumbai looked unreal from above, rooftops turned into islands, streets turned into rivers, whole buildings cracked open like shells.

Survivors moved in the distance. Tiny shapes jumping gaps, pulling each other up, running when they spotted movement.

That’s when I saw someone watching me.

A figure on the rooftop across the flooded alley. Still as a statue. Too far to see the face, but I could feel it staring.

I raised the pipe without thinking.

The figure lifted a hand.

And waved.

Not fast. Not friendly. Slow and careful… like it was practicing how to be human.

My stomach tightened.

I didn’t wave back.

I crouched behind the tank, heart hammering so hard I thought it would give me away. I waited. One minute. Two. Five.

When I peeked again, the opposite rooftop was empty.

No footsteps. No splash. No sign it ever existed.

Just wet concrete and a torn banner flapping in the wind like skin.

That night, it rained again.

Clean rain this time. Real rain. It should’ve felt like a blessing. I held out a bottle and filled it until my hands cramped, drinking so fast my throat hurt.

For a few minutes, I almost felt normal.

Then I heard the sound that made my body lock up.

Footsteps inside the building.

Not on another roof.

Inside *my* building.

Coming up the stairwell.

Slow. Careful. Not panicked. Not running.

Climbing.

I grabbed the pipe and backed away from the rooftop door. My wet hands slipped on the rust, and I had to grip harder until my palms burned.

The footsteps stopped.

Three knocks came through the door.

Soft.

Polite.

Three taps.

I didn’t breathe.

No one knocks politely at the end of the world.

Three taps again, just as gentle.

Then a voice, muffled through the door.

A man’s voice, shaky and tired.

“Please… I know you’re up there. I’m not here to hurt you.”

I stayed silent.

My heart beat so loud it felt like the whole building could hear it.

The voice continued, calm like it was trying to soothe a frightened animal.

“I have water. I have food. I just want to talk.”

Liar. Even if it wasn’t a lie, it didn’t matter. My father was right. People didn’t help anymore. People didn’t come to talk.

They came to take.

Then the voice said something it couldn’t possibly know.

“Arav… open the door.”

Every hair on my body lifted.

I hadn’t told anyone my name.

My father hadn’t shouted it. My mother hadn’t screamed at it. No one from the rooftops knew me.

I stepped backward, shaking so hard my teeth clicked.

The voice on the other side got quieter, almost gentle.

“It’s okay,” it said. “Your mother sent me.”

I felt my stomach drop.

My mother was dead. We buried her under metal because we didn’t even have dirt.

The doorknob turned slowly.

Not forced.

Not kicked.

Turned like someone had a key.

I raised the pipe, ready to swing at the moment the door opened.

But it didn’t open.

The knob stopped.

Silence.

Then the voice sighed, wet and long, like breathing through water.

“Fine.”

The footsteps began going back down the stairs.

Slow.

Unhurried.

Like it wasn’t leaving.

Like it was just giving me time.

I didn’t move for hours. My arms ached from holding the pipe up. My throat hurt from holding back sounds I didn’t want it to hear.

When the sky finally darkened again, I crawled to the edge of the roof and looked down into the floodwater below.

A face floated under the surface.

Just beneath it.

Eyes open.

Staring straight up at me.

And it smiled.

Its lips moved without sound, but I heard the words anyway, clear as my own thoughts.

In my voice.

Perfectly copied.

“You’re already mine.”

I backed away so fast I slipped, scraping my knees on concrete.

The water below made a soft, pleased sound.

Like laughing.



If you want the rest, I’ll post it. But after this point… it only gets worse.
