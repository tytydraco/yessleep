Working at a haunted hotel is never boring, especially after those ghost hunters stayed the night and posted a video of their experience. Now, we're fully booked months in advance. The best part is, our tenants make their rooms their own, and their unique haunting techniques has guests demanding specific rooms to get their scare on. Our mutually beneficial relationship with the spirits couldn't be more perfect.

For a while, everyone was happy, until we got a new tenant. And that was when I learned what this hotel truly was.

The moment I saw the rear room's security screen flicker, I put up the *"Be back soon! If it's urgent, call the number below!"* sign on the front desk and ran to the back. After unlocking the door, I slid behind the counter and plastered on my best customer service smile.

"Welcome to— …"

I trailed off as I stared at the figure before me. It wasn't the first time I'd been left in charge of managing new tenants, but it was my first time seeing one this grotesque. His eyes glinted deep inside his crushed skull, his broad frame hanging lopsided, his skin stretched so taut it highlighted every broken bone in his body. 

Mrs. Coriz, the hotel's owner, taught me that spirits were not dead people, as we all assumed, but entities that materialize into existence during extreme pain and suffering. Since they feed off fear, they take the shape of what they believe is scary, and this guy really went all out!

"Is there a problem?" he growled, his torn lips flapping against his broken teeth.

Realizing I was staring too long in admiration, I quickly shook my head and smiled, making sure to address him respectfully as Wehd (which is their version of Mister or Missus.)

"None at all, Wd. Ruiggac!" I chirped as I wiggled the computer mouse to wake up the screen. "Welcome to The Eidolon Hotel! Let me see …" I clicked open a window. "It looks like you've signed all the paperwork with Mrs. Coriz, so let me show you to your new residence!"

Wd. Ruiggac grunted, yet he floated behind me as I led him up the stairs and through a hallway parallel to the one our guests use.

"You're lucky to snag this room!" I said, glancing behind me with a smile. "We rarely have vacancies, our tenants stay for the long haul! The last tenant didn't renew their lease only because they wanted to haunt in colder climates, but before that, they were here fifteen years!"

Wd. Ruiggac grunted again as he looked at the flickering fluorescent lights, discolored brick walls, and cracked cement floor. 

'You'll love it here! People come for fun thrills and everyone enjoys themselves!" I stood in front of the number 126 spray painted on the bricks. "Your room is on the other side of this wall. It's currently unoccupied to give you time to settle in, but tomorrow we have a group of YouTubers who'll be staying the night."

"I know, Mrs. Coriz told me," he grumbled.

"Alright, great! I'll leave you to get settled! If you need anything, you can go down to the back desk. I work from 7pm to 7am and Mrs. Coriz takes the remaining hours."

"I know."

"Great! Oh, and if we need to talk to you for any reason, a small light in the room will flash, indicating we're calling. Just come out here and talk through this." I pointed at a small speaker mounted on the wall. "Don't worry, this hall is—"

"Soundproof, I know. Mrs. Coriz already told me all of this," he said with an irritated sigh before disappearing through the wall.

"Can't wait to see what you do!" I called after him.

I barely made out his grunt.

Sighing, I massaged the smile off my face as I hustled to the front desk. The rest of the night was relatively routine, and I made my rounds through the two floors, smiling as I heard the guests' screams and nervous giggles. It was all harmless fun for everyone. Only two guests made a request, and I handed them the painkillers they wanted after they'd bashed their heads into each other while hiding the closet. 

The next evening, around 8pm, three teens stumbled into the lobby, filming each other as they obnoxiously laughed, fake-screamed, and pointed to random corners and yelled, "Ahhh, ghosts!"

They stood in line behind the others waiting to check in, but they didn't stop making fun of every decor choice in the room. I gave the other guests apologetic smiles as I handed them their keys, and I took a deep breath and masked my irritation behind professionalism when the teens approached the desk.

"Hello, welcome to The Eidolon Hotel," I said. "Do you have a reservation?"

"Are you a ghost?" the taller boy asked, shoving his phone in my face as the bespectacled boy and freckled girl snickered.

"Well, I work from seven to seven, so this job *does* make me feel dead inside sometimes."

They snorted a laugh and the girl leaned against the counter. "For real, though, this is all just a scam, right? You've got, like, speakers and fans and projections and shit, right?"

I shrugged. "Why don't you stay the night and find out? Do you have a reservation?"

"Yeah, we do, and we're going to blow this scam wide open and post it all over YouTube." The bespectacled boy slammed his passport down. "Check us in."

"Sure thing." I entered their information and smiled as I put them in room 126. "All set! This is your key. There's a vending machine near the gift shop there. I'm here all night if you need to check out early or require any assistance."

They let out derisive laughs as they dragged their carry-ons up the creaky staircase, and I ignored them as I welcomed the next guests. I couldn't wait for Wd. Ruiggac to wipe their smug smiles off their stupid faces.

After midnight, I was done checking everyone in, so I put up the *"Be back soon! If it's urgent, call the number below!"* sign, grabbed my phone, and went about my rounds. My smile faded as I passed room 126. I couldn't hear any screaming or nervous laughter. I just heard rude jokes and the television rotating between channels. Perhaps Wd. Ruiggac was waiting for the perfect moment. The night was still young.

My phone vibrated, and I answered the call as I rushed back to the front desk. An elderly couple had gotten lost driving and were wondering if we had a room available for the night. They seemed exhausted, so I made them some tea and invited them to rest on the lobby couches while I "checked". We obviously didn't have any vacancies, but I did call a nearby motel and booked them a room.

I explained the situation to them, and they were very grateful. They seemed intrigued by the hotel's cracked wood and rusty iron decor, so I dove into its spooky theme, and we ended up booking them one of our tamer rooms six months from now. Afterwards, I helped them set up their GPS to guide them to the motel, and I wished them well.

Proud of my marketing skills, I smiled to myself as I took the teacups to the kitchenette in the back. I dumped them in the sink and turned to grab a sponge, and I gasped at the sight of Wd. Ruiggac filling the doorway.

"Oh, jeez, you startled me!" I said with a breathless chuckle as I put a hand over my racing heart. "Is there a problem?"

"You lied to me!" he growled, his eyes flashing from deep inside his dented skull.

I frowned and stepped back. "What do you mean?"

"You said the guests come here for fun thrills and everyone enjoys themselves!"

He swiped the microwave off the counter, and I gasped and ducked as it went soaring before crashing against the wall.

"W-Wait, Wd. Ruiggac!" I said, my trembling hands up like a pathetic shield. "If you have a complaint, I'll be more than happy to—"

"Don't give me your empty rehearsed blather!" He roared, denting the fridge as he kicked it all the way across the room. "I was promised fear and fun, not insults and disrespect!"

I screamed and ducked again as the wall to my left exploded, chunks of plaster and rubble flying across the kitchenette. I barely had time to look up before one of the exposed pipes snapped free, spraying water everywhere as it wound its way around my neck. I only managed to croak out a weak "no!" as it tightened and dragged me up against the broken wall.

"W-Wd. Ruiggac!" I rasped, drenched in cold water as I clawed at the pipe, my heart running amok. "Please … w-we can discuss this!"

"What is there to discuss! You lied to me! I've *never* experienced disrespect like I had today from those insolent maggots!"

The pipe lifted me higher, and I wheezed in terror, the toes of my shoes scraping the floor as I tried to push myself up. He was out of control. I had to calm him down before he killed me. 

"W-Wd. Ruiggac, I don't understand! I'm t-terrified right now! I can't believe they weren't!"

"If I was allowed to do this, they wouldn't have lasted a minute!"

"Wh-Why can't you?"

The pipe tightened as he snarled, "You want me to get evicted?"

Spittle flew from my mouth as I choked out squeaks, my rabid pulse thudding in my skull. "Wh … at?" I managed to utter as I struggled to breathe.

"Don't you work here? The lease forbids physical manipulation!"

"S … orry … did … n't know! P … please! Let … me … call …. Mrs. … Cor … iz!"

The pipe slackened, and I gulped in a hungry breath as my feet splashed to the ground. 

"Call her," he snapped.

I nodded, slipping a shaky hand into my soaked pocket. The pipe was still around my throat, too tight for me to slip through. He was still angry, I had to be careful. After a fruitless search of all my pockets, I scanned the kitchenette with a distressed gaze, and I found my phone lying facedown on the submerged floor.

"Oh no.” I pointed to it and turned a pleading gaze to Wd. Ruiggac. "Please can I check if it's still working?”

"You're completely useless," he growled.

I screamed as the pipe tightened again, water cascading over me as I struggled to pry myself free.

"Wd. Ruiggac, is there a problem?"

Wd. Ruiggac and I turned our attention to the door, and joy filled my panicking heart when I saw Mrs. Coriz.

"Yes, there's a problem!" he yelled. "This worthless employee of yours lied to me, told me guests are looking for 'fun thrills' and everyone enjoys themselves. I didn't enjoy myself! I've never been treated this badly in all my existence!"

"That's definitely not what we want here at Eidolon Hotel," Mrs. Coriz said, not fazed at all by the sight of the flooded kitchenette, destroyed wall, or choking employee. "Please come with me to my office so we may properly rectify this situation."

Wd. Ruiggac floated over to her, and I squeaked out a hoarse plea as I gripped the constricting pipe. He ignored me, but Mrs. Coriz didn't.

"Please release my employee."

"Not until I'm satisfied with your solution."

"You'll be more than satisfied. You're my priority, but I'm still running a hotel and I need someone to man the front desk."

Wd. Ruiggac grunted, and I gasped as the pipe loosened and I collapsed to the ground with a splash. Coughing, I rubbed my neck as I watched them walk away, bitterness and relief clashing in my frazzled mind. We'd had unsatisfied customers before, but none had gone this far. He almost killed me.

After collecting myself, I grabbed my now useless phone and got up on trembling legs. Overwhelmed with emotions and unsure of what to do, I let autopilot take over as I focused on my job. The first thing to do was stop the flooding, so I opened the far cupboard and turned a few knobs. Once the flowing water slowed to a few residual drops, I hopped out to the hall and checked around, and I was glad to see the damage restricted to just the kitchenette.

Grabbing a towel from the linen room, I hustled to the front desk, relieved there was no one waiting there. Shaking with a mixture of adrenaline and cold, I sat down, kicked off my soaked shoes, and began towel-drying my hair, only to stop when a familiar laugh drew my attention. I pulled the towel down to see the freckled girl strolling over to the vending machine. 

"Why are you wet?" she asked, filming me.

"One of our ghosts threw a tantrum," I rasped, flinging the towel over my shoulder as I unearthed a poised smile.

She snorted a laugh and shoved her credit card in the vending machine. "You guys are so lame. Your stories are lame. Your decor is lame. Your effects are lame. The 'ghost' in our room is a joke. I've seen scarier on Scooby Doo."

"Maybe that's the ghost's plan."

A soda can rumbled down, and she purchased another as she smirked at me. "And what plan is that?"

"To have you enjoy a false sense of security before really bringing on the fear."

She scoffed, punching in a third soda. "And what’s 'bringing on the fear'? You sneaking in dressed in a white sheet?"

"By the end of the night, you'll be wishing that was it."

She scoffed again, cradling the three sodas with one arm while still filming me with the other. "You really are lame. Say hi to YouTube, loser!"

I wiggled my fingers at the camera, and she chuckled as she made her way up the stairs. "Enjoy your last night scamming people. This time tomorrow, you're gonna be all over the internet!"

I didn't reply as I watched her ascend, and my smile dropped once she was out of view. It was people like her and her friends that ruined places like this. Mrs. Coriz should start being selective with the guests. She should also start being more transparent with me about the tenants’ rules here.

An hour later, Mrs. Coriz walked over to me. "Are you alright?" she asked in concern, placing a hand on my shoulder.

I rubbed my sore neck. "Not really. How did you know I was in trouble?"

"I have cameras in the back rooms that notify me whenever spirits are in the vicinity. I saw what was happening and rushed over. I'm glad I wasn't too late."

"He's insane, he almost killed me! And he destroyed property!”

“Property destruction is nothing I haven't dealt with before. I've already called our usual 24-hour handymen to come fix the damage. But I want to make sure you're alright. Do you need to go to the hospital?”

“No, nothing is broken or needs stitches. Just bruises. Are you going to evict him?"

“Normally, I would, but he's been through a lot.”

I frowned, incredulous. “*He's* been through a lot?”

“Yes. And what happened was my fault for not anticipating his reaction to disbelieving guests … and for not being completely open with you.” She sighed and pulled up a stool to sit beside me. “The Eidolon Hotel is a lot more than what I've told you. It's also a sanctuary." 

My incredulity shifted to confusion. “A sanctuary?"

“Yes. While most spirits are born of suffering and feed on fear, some are born of evil and feed on each other. The older the spirit, the more rich they are, and Wd. Ruiggac’s advanced age has made him the target of a particularly ravenous group of these vipirits.”

My eyes widened. “What? They want to *eat* him? How? He's not …” I held my palms a distance apart and moved my hands up and down. “... solid.”

"Neither are vipirits. They feed by merging into their prey and absorbing their essence.”

“Woah. So, he's here hiding from them?”

“Yes, as are many of our tenants. It's our job to protect them from the vipirits."

I blinked, the reality settling in. “Wait, how?” I shot a nervous glance behind me, rubbing my bruised throat. “If they come here looking for trouble, we're no match. How can we even tell them apart from the good ones?”

“Don't worry, I've set up protections. And they’re easy to differentiate because they're essence is white, not silver.”

I turned back to her, anger replacing my anxiety. “Shouldn't I have known about this when you first hired me? That explains why Wd. Ruiggac was so angry about being evicted when I asked why he didn't use physical manipulation, which you didn't tell me was forbidden here, by the way!”

"It wasn't relevant to your job." She sighed, adjusting her bracelets. "Or so I thought. But Wd. Ruiggac shouldn't be a problem anymore. I've decided to modify all the leases to allow for physical manipulation, as long as they don't injure the guests or cause permanent damage to the room."

I sat up, my emotions rotating to excitement. "Really? As of now?"

"For Wd. Ruiggac, yes."

I couldn't help but smile. "Oh, I can't wait for him to scare the hell out of those brats!" My smile faded. "By the way, you should be more selective with who you let stay here.”

“I agree. There's a lot I’d like to discuss with you regarding the running of this hotel, but we can do that later. You should go home and rest. I'll take over the remainder of your shift.”

"Oh, no, I'm not leaving until I see what Wd. Ruiggac—"

My sentence was cut short by a trio of screams, and we turned to the staircase as it squeaked against frantic footsteps. The freckled girl was the first to appear, her face twisted in terror as she flew down the stairs. 

She tripped on the last step and faceplanted, but that didn't stop the two boys from leaping over her and dashing to the front door, their hyperventilating breaths stuttering as they jerked and pulled at the handle. The girl scrambled up and ran over to them, sobbing as blood dripped from her nose.

As horrible as it sounds, the sight elicited a genuine smile from me, and I propped my elbow on the desk and leaned my chin on my fist, watching with ultimate satisfaction.

"Oh, my goodness, are you alright?" Mrs. Coriz asked as she hurried over.

"Let us out!" The taller boy yelled, crying as he yanked at the door handle.

"This door only opens from the outside or with a code for this very reason. We can't have our spooked guests running out and driving under such conditions. You also need to check out."

"But he's going to kill us!"

"No one is going to kill you. Our ghosts are friendly and provide hauntings that match the guest's attitude. You must have presented yourselves as very confident."

They stopped fighting with the door, their chests heaving, their faces drained of blood.

"We th-thought it was fake," the bespectacled boy said, trembling.

"He must have taken that as a challenge," Mrs. Coriz said. "Come, sit. I'll make you some herbal tea to help calm you down, and I'll get you some ice for your nose."

The three teens sat down and wrapped themselves with the provided blankets, jumping at every sound and shadow, their phones nowhere to be seen.

I couldn't help myself as I asked, “Did you get the footage you wanted?”

My smile widened as they refused to make eye contact. As crazy as this shift was, it couldn't have ended in a better way.
