&#x200B;


It was at this point where the entire facility had been taken over by this group. They had helicopters buzzing in to deploy more of these commandos under their order within twenty minutes. I know the sounds of a deployment pretty well, they had to have had commandos stationed all over the building by now, inside and out. I ventured even snipers and men with RPG’s being positioned in elevated places. They were preparing for a battle.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here’s what happened.

&#x200B;


Three days passed and it was Christmas eve when the people took over the facility. We were in zip-ties and placed in the locker room. Commandos would periodically watch over us. We were kept hydrated and fed sometimes and Jeff was actually still quiet throughout this. I did my best to tell him that help will be here soon and to try and relax, although it really didn’t seem to faze him. We were basically P.O.W.’s at this point and I was probably a little more frightened than he was. I had to be quiet because one guy was really rude to us for no good reason. Telling us that we are going to die here and trying to frighten us. We were already confused and helpless. They weren't going to just announce it, but there was no doubting we were fooled by some militia or terrorist group. However, I noticed a quick lack of morale with a couple of the soldiers. They knew they were in for it and the actual military would be here probably any minute. 

&#x200B;


“If it wasn’t for that guy esca-” One of them stopped himself and cleared his throat while the other commando remained quiet. 

&#x200B;


Christmas rolled around. There was heavy snowfall and their command stated that a winter storm was approaching. This gave them the thought that any attack by armed forces would be put off for the time being, but they were wrong. That same soldier who would give us shit remained inside the office with another operative for a period of time until they were ordered to report back immediately. 

&#x200B;


***“This is Theta Command. All units report to your designated battle zones. Weapons free.”***

&#x200B;


“FUCK!” I heard the one guy shout then looked over to us. “If you know what’s good for you, I’d hide somewhere.” The other guy scrambled out without a word. “Man, screw you guys! I should just kill you both right now!” But he didn’t. He stood there and stared at us with his hands trembling. He screamed out and took off to fulfill his orders. Jeff and I were petrified in stone. They only used zip-ties so we easily escaped. I remember thinking about just running but I valued my life and decided on staying inside this building. We got ourselves free and stood for a moment.

&#x200B;


“I don't know what the hell is going on. Let’s barricade ourselves in! We don't stand a chance out there. What if something happens and we have to call for help?” Jeff, for once, said to me in a surprisingly low tone and we both frantically began bombarding the door using the metal desk, the fridge and filing cabinets. The two of us were strong enough to get a good blockade up. There was no time to even think, we kept finding more items to put against the door until we definitely had enough weight to hold. At least for a while. 

&#x200B;


After we were satisfied, we just both looked at each other panting, and then over to the monitors. “What the hell, right?” I remember saying and we then scrambled over there to watch the feed. What unfolded, will forever be something that replays inside my head worse than any kind of flashback from my time serving. It was an absolute massacre. 

&#x200B;


First, from inside the building and to the right of us, we heard the sounds of armed forces approaching. A loud *wham* then boomed from within the facility, and we saw the damage on the monitor. It was definitely an airstrike on building B. A cacophony of gunfire then erupted all around us and we saw in the feed as the battle ensued. I could see men falling to their deaths, small explosions, scientists scrambling out of the facility and getting gunned down. Helicopter turret guns ripped a handful of the operatives in half. Instead of hearing that ringing, or even jingle bells and Christmas carols on this holiday season, it was replaced with the sounds of total chaos and bloodshed.

&#x200B;


“Holy shit.” I said crouching down by one of the monitors, telling Jeff we need to either get down or get in a locker. One of the handbooks stated that in case of an emergency or terrorist attack, an option would be to lock the door and call for help then find a locker. The lockers were bullet-proof and big enough for someone to hide inside of it until help arrived. Bullets were already ricocheting off the building. We had to find some cover immediately. 

&#x200B;


The locker room was a small space in the building, and I yelled for Jeff to get inside one of the lockers. “If we stay put, we’ll get shot through a window!” I shouted to him and he nodded his head. A louder explosion occurred, shaking the entire building and we stopped to look out of the window it came from. We were stunned to see that they managed to successfully target the oncoming military chopper and take it down. It spun out of control and landed right by where Phil would be stationed. 

&#x200B;


A single window shattered then, we got moving while ducking and holding our heads. Having no other choice, we opened the lockers closest to us and squeezed in, getting as low as possible. The suffocating dread was persistently clocking down more minutes of my life no doubt. The gunfire and explosions outside were enough to drive anyone mad, but being trapped in a metal coffin on top of it was not on my bucket list. Needless to say, we were trapped regardless and just needed to wait this out.

&#x200B;


After some time, the gunfire died down and we would only occasionally hear a pop ring out every so often and shouting. The feed was still playing, and I had a thought. There is a record option and I decided to get out of the locker and press the switch for it. I took a deep, long and exaggerated breath, then slowly got out of the locker. Jeff soon followed. “Let’s... check the camera feed. I want to record this.” I told him and he nodded. Looking around, we found a couple of stun batons to clutch onto in an attempt to feel like we could defend ourselves against any of the operatives trying to get in here and kill us. We then walked over to the monitors and found the chairs to sit down in. 

&#x200B;


I’d say, about ten minutes passed then. I don't know how long the fighting went on for. I hadn't even thought to check the time. The odds, for whatever reason, seemed to be evenly matched. This was a brutal battle. Getting a closer look at things as the feed was recording everything, we noticed just how many commandos they really had. How the hell they managed to station hundreds of armed men in that facility, I have no knowledge of.

&#x200B;


“I... don’t even know what to say.” I remember saying out loud instead of just thinking it. A short moment passed and as if on cue, something else was happening in one of the camera feeds that displayed an area behind building B and A. It was at this moment that a raw and all-encompassing new fear now took hold. There is really no other explanation for what I am about to tell you. They obviously should have sent a larger strike team here to fight because on one of the camera feeds displayed a person clutching a soldier up by the throat with one arm. He was doing... something... to the soldier's abdomen but we couldn’t really see. The man was at least seven or eight feet tall, maybe more and was lifting the soldier up with little effort while completely fucking bare from the waist up.  He looked to be wearing some kind of hospital garb only covered in blood and grime.

&#x200B;


With ease, this beast of a man tossed the soldier aside like he was an empty bottle. You could clearly see the muscle definition ripple and turn red, despite the quality of the feed. He just stood there breathing into the air like a mad dog. Head violently twitching. This guy was an animal. It was already 17 degrees Fahrenheit out there. This was unnatural.

&#x200B;


“How in the fuck is that possible!” I remember saying out loud. Just then the brute snapped his head to his left. As if in response to me speaking. I remember almost letting myself go right then and there, looking over at Jeff briefly as he looked back with shocked expressions on our faces. Before I could even react, the man was no longer on the camera feed. “Oh god, please help us.” Jeff whispered and I noticed him clearly shivering. I felt a horrible chill too and thought about getting in the locker again. I raised my arm and pointed to them, and he nodded to me. We quickly got inside the lockers again and kept the stun baton in our grasp. Seconds passed. More time passed. Suddenly, there was a burst of loud banging on the door, and I mean, loud. As I type this my hands tremble.

&#x200B;


One of the windows burst and a rain of shattered glass poured from somewhere inside. More glass broke and I closed my eyes and felt the ground shake. There was this horrible squelching noise, as if something long and wet were writhing and reaching for something inside the office. Whatever it was, it was making contact with things inside of there. It even rustled the locker a bit. I was keeping my eyes tightly shut and after another few seconds, I was brave enough to open my eyes and try to get a peek out of the vent. There were these red shapes appearing outside the small cracks. I couldn’t quite see it all but eventually the lights went out, most likely from this thing breaking all of the bulbs and probably the monitors. I began to hear this raspy breathing through the wreckage, as if coming from a ravenous maw. I braced myself and stopped moving entirely. In an instant, everything just stopped. I tried my best to cover my mouth and breathe through little air pockets in my gloves, because I was basically hyperventilating. I’m honestly surprised my heart hadn’t burst then. I almost wished it had, looking back.

&#x200B;


A short moment passed, and we remained still inside the lockers. My breathing calmed and I was able to quietly catch my breath. Thank God for the sounds of the storm out there muffling my quiet breaths. Jeff must have been doing something similar. As the seconds rolled on, I listened closely for any sounds but only the storm persisted. Once I had the thought to close my eyes again and take another quiet breath, I heard the most terrifying noise come from out there. Like several nails on a chalkboard, only it was the yell of a man crying for help perversely mixed with a dying animal screeching in pain. That ringing came back full force and I lost consciousness inside the locker.

&#x200B;


I don’t know how much time had passed, but I woke to the sound of Jeff opening his locker. Opening my eyes, he appeared before me and helped me out of the locker. “Are you okay?” He offered. I said yes and he spoke again. “I think whatever that thing is, is gone...” I looked around, the entire office was trashed, monitors were broken and there were these dark marks all across the ceiling and walls. Noticing the broken window, I saw the blood trail that led to the forest from the facility out there and breathed deeply. That freak of nature showed no signs of being harmed by the weather and escaped this place. That thought alone terrifies me. I looked back to the monitors and noticed two of them still weakly displaying the feed. Both the bodies of the soldiers and commandos lay fallen all around, and I could see some of their weapons still intact.

&#x200B;


“Jeff. I know this sounds crazy... But I have to go out there and find out what’s going on.” I said to him. 

&#x200B;


“I understand, I think.” He said to me and put his head down. 

&#x200B;


“As a former infantryman stationed in Iraq, I feel like it’s my duty to go out there and figure something out. Anything.” I stared at him feeling that old sense of duty return to me and he raised his baton. “Do you need back-up?” He asked me and smiled weakly. I smiled back, but I honestly did not want the young man to risk his life, in case there was something else out there. Then again, someone to watch my six wouldn’t hurt at all.

&#x200B;


“I appreciate you, let’s go. When we get out there, snag one of their guns and let’s try and look for a radio one of our soldiers had. Ours can only reach within the facility and we might have a chance of calling out for their back up squad” I told him. “Good idea.” He replied. We devised a quick plan to get inside building B and see if there was a communication center like their headquarters still intact. “You ready?” I asked him. He took a huge breath, and I did the same. “Alright, let’s get out through that window. I’ll go first. Watch the area.” I said and we went ahead with our plan to brave the storm and head for building B.

&#x200B;


There may be other survivors in there who could still be armed and willing to kill us. I told this to Jeff, and he said he was ready for anything after what we went through. I had the feeling we both knew this was a risky idea, but we were now in this together no matter what else would be in store for us. If no one else was coming, we had to do something and we had to do it now.

&#x200B;


One of the windows was broken and we could easily fit through it. The jump wouldn’t be but ten feet, so we easily made it out in the cold. It was still dark, but the sun was about to rise so we had a dim orange glow faintly aiding our sight. We both found rifles and searched for rounds and magazines. Everything was quiet now, save for the howling wind that attacked our senses and we made our way to the entrance of building B. The snow was pelting us in the face and we were covered in it by the time we got inside. The opening on the large metal door had caved in from an explosion and we slipped inside avoiding the small fires that blazed menacingly in the wind. 

&#x200B;


&#x200B;

Once inside, we found out quickly just how awful this atrocity was. Not only were people shot and left for dead, but there were also bodies torn to shreds and discarded. That thing must have had its way with them because blood caked the walls and bodies lay in a gory mess. Bullet holes and charred marks from more explosions littered the walls and any surface. We both just looked at each other in shock. “Let’s go.” I said quietly and we proceeded forward, because I noticed an opening with some lights that flickered around a corner. We cautiously made our way through and got to a point where it looked like we finally hit an area with the new construction. 

&#x200B;


The addition was dug out deep below and made into this make-shift science lab. Wires and bulbs that were connected hung up haphazardly to keep the light illuminating the entire area. I could see those large speakers embedded into the rocky walls. Sparks flew from multiple instruments and machines that buzzed or malfunctioned but were neatly stacked in certain areas. There was a large operating table with bolted down reinforced shackles that lay broken to the side of it. More blood and glass were littered around this area. I even picked up a few documents on the ground, but most were stepped on or covered in filth or blood to even be legible. Scientists and soldiers, both our military and their commandos were all dead. I was speechless. There were no words to even be said at all. We just walked into something straight out of a horror film. 

&#x200B;


“I’m going to have a look around those desks, you check that upper level over there and see if you can find a soldier with a radio.” I told Jeff and he agreed, aiming the rifle around and walking away. I made my way towards the set of desks that had computers still booted up. Some were destroyed and I tried messing around with one of them and opening anything that could tell me what they were doing here. I couldn’t find anything discernable. Pushing that aside, I moved towards another desk and had a look around. More bodies lay dead on the floor, and I decided to look for a radio. I bent down to one of them and moved his body to look up at me. The soldier suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and face. 

&#x200B;


Just then I heard a cough and aimed my weapon at the source of the sudden noise. It was one of their commandos that was still alive. I had the thought of just opening fire, but I wanted to try and get some answers. His head was slumped forward, leaning against a crate and I could see his ribcage was poking out through the torn body armor. He must have been in a great deal of pain. I used this to my advantage and approached him. There wasn’t a helmet on him, but the hairline was oddly familiar. Right as he looked up at me, I knew it was Calloway. One of the guys that had me sign the NDA. 

&#x200B;


He sputtered and blood flew from his mouth, trying to say something to me and I remained motionless, transfixed on this horrifying situation. His right arm was twitching, and he attempted to reach for what I assumed was his wound. His arm began moving faster and just as I realized he was reaching for something else, I snapped back and a muffled *pop* to my right rang out. Calloways head caved in. The pistol he went for dropped from his grip and landed to the side. I shouted out and got down to my knee, almost falling on my ass aiming the rifle around and found out there was another survivor. One of our guys had a silenced pistol aimed at Calloway and saved my life! He must have noticed my security guard patch on my winter coat and made the judgment call that I wasn’t a threat.

&#x200B;


I quickly registered the situation and called out to Jeff, rushing over to the soldier while aiming around to see if anyone else was around, almost in tears at this point. I finally got to him and steadied the man in my arms noticing his rank. He was the captain for this platoon. Jeff quickly made it over and the soldier was reaching for his face mask. Jeff then took off the soldier's helmet and face mask for him with ease. There was blood pooling out of his mouth, and he also had severe wounds to the abdomen. Some of the blood got onto my coat and hands, but I didn’t care. I needed to hear this man's last words now or it would be too late. He put his life on the line for THIS.

&#x200B;


“Can you speak?” I asked and he was still coughing up blood quietly. He did not speak or move at first, he just looked at me with an expression one would only have on the verge of death and then with a slow and deliberate motion, he opened his front pouch and felt around for something. I saw his eyes close, and he smiled through the pain. He then frowned and pulled out a small USB port and offered it to me, still coughing. When he did this, my insides flipped, and I instantly asked: “What is this?” then took it from his hand. The captain looked up at the ceiling while choking on blood and only said:

&#x200B;


“Everything.” 

&#x200B;


As his eyes rolled, his body went still, and he took his last breath right there in my arms. There was nothing else to do but gently lay him back to the ground and let the fallen captain rest in peace now.

&#x200B;


After a passing moment of silence, I took one look at the USB port in my hand and decided on reading this now on one of the computers here. 



"Jeff, cover me, okay? I know this is reckless, but I need to know what this contains now. I don't think I an wait." I told him and Jeff, as usual, kept quiet and nodded giving me his stern look again.



I made it to a computer and popped it in with Jeff following. He raised the weapon to study the area periodically, but we couldn’t keep our eyes away from the screen. There was a report with some attached files. Once the file transfer was complete, I read it all in one go as quickly as I possibly could. 

&#x200B;


To sum it up, this attack and gathering of information on a certain terrorist organization was called **OPERATION: WINTER EYES** and anyone available on call was sent to wipe out the force from a group called “TNDA” that was found on U.S. soil. Otherwise known as: The New Dawn Administration. All of what you I am about to share is obviously not meant for civilians to hear about, but all things considered, I don't really give a fuck right now.

&#x200B;


Throughout reading this, I found out that not only are secrets and advanced technology being kept from the public but ranks within NASA had been infiltrated by one of these members and gained information about a planet's moon that's never been documented before, according to the report. Which planet is not stated. Apparently, one of those moons had proof of living organisms residing there. Thermal readings and multiple satellite videos displayed these life forms fully functioning and people were beyond ecstatic. A team was of course sent out into the outer edge of the planet's rim. The ship sent a team of fourteen people, and they came back, but something terrible happened to some of those astronauts and it was seemingly because of this TNDA group. Records indicate that someone from inside the space craft fired off some kind of relay signal that disrupted the life forms from moving and quite possibly, sustaining their habitat. 

&#x200B;


These *“creatures”* were able to somehow collectively reach the NASA space craft from the moon and cause damage to the hull. Records indicate the impact on the damage report showed no signs of any cause for losing control out there in space. However, the report stated that several of the life forms housed themselves inside the bodies of some of the astronauts sent out there and throughout this were able to pilot their way back to Earth. The report indicated that these parasitic anomalies are only capable of feeding, reproducing and if housed inside another biological life form for a long enough period of time, can essentially rewire the human genome down to the very last cell within the unfortunate victim's body. They classified the size of the things to be about up to six or seven feet long and were considered as being somewhat similar to Taenia Solium, or pork tapeworm.

&#x200B;


Scientists, at the time of containing the initial outbreak, were able to use cutting edge technology to halt the organisms from causing any more harm and only when the spacecraft came back to the NASA station did researchers find out that this parasite was able to perfectly take over and even mimic the host it is able to feed on or infect with its offspring, which are microscopic larvae-like organisms that infect your organs from the inside and eventually taking over by reaching the brain. 




The organs and limbs are digested and somehow reanimated from within using this substance the larvae collectively secrete that is similar to mucus, and the main parasite can trigger commands through its own cellular network like a hive mind. It can then even intake oxygen like any other human being after a full assimilation, steadily growing larger and larger from within as the feeding continues. How large they can grow isn't documented but there was a "Patient Zero" that was supposed to help them determine that in humans.

&#x200B;


The scientists were, at one point, able to test these things on animals like dogs, monkeys and even large reptiles with results that would make your stomach churn. What was supposed to be a simple gather and collect data mission in space turned out to be something unimaginable and the man we just saw toss a soldier like it was yesterday's trash? Patient Zero. 

&#x200B;


Patient Zero had no record of any identity, at least not on this report. Just that he was an astronaut sent to that planet and the name was blocked out. He was actually being hauled to a top-secret government prison when TNDA intercepted the smaller military convoy and successfully took the shackled brute to this steel mill, tricking Sam into thinking this was official business somehow. The military tried to track down the group but were unsuccessful. TNDA decided that this was a golden opportunity and began experiments on the subject immediately here. Acquiring all the necessary faked documents to make everything seem legitimate. There was a sidenote typed out in this section that read:

&#x200B;


"POSSIBLE AID FROM DOUBLE AGENT: IDENTITY UNKNOWN"

&#x200B;


The file also indicated that any other abilities of this organism while inside a biological lifeform were yet to be determined, but thoroughly studied. After more research, they concluded that certain vibrations, frequencies and soundwaves were able to control the organism from within its host, putting it in some sort of stasis. They collected *that* data from the audio logs of the mission, determining the soundwaves on that planet caused them to, in unison, vibrate on the planet's surface and are contained within the atmosphere that way. But the relay signal caused the piercing frequency to occur as they approached the unknown planet before the attack. Whoever figured that out had to be a damn genius. That would explain the loudspeakers here and it was recorded that the designated frequency would cause an amount of discomfort in human beings yet the sound is somehow barely audible. It must have been amplified underground.

&#x200B;


When introduced to water or certain temperatures, it adapts to the environment without fail as the cellular structure of these parasitic entities are not fully known to planet earth. If housed and fed inside the invaded biological organism long enough, the human who fell victim to the parasite would appear the same as the person they were before, but only now all human emotion and empathy have been devoured. You would see a shell of the former person they once were. The report also claims if the limbs are detached or removed the cellular function within the reanimated body would cause a mutation to occur. That was the only information I could gather from this report on Patient Zero and these things they found, anything else is either yet to be documented or the government and TNDA know more...

&#x200B;


However now, since some assholes in a fucked the fuck up doomsday cult disturbed the natural order in the solar system, we now know that these things made contact with humans and can remain housed comfortably inside a life form and like a twisted puppeteer sent from outer space. TNDA also had done their own studies, but I couldn't find any information in this building. How to exterminate these things have yet to be documented.

&#x200B;


With all of this in mind, there was another attached file that explained how one of the underground Hives and facilities under direct command of the United States Government had, in fact, been compromised at one point as well. Thus, turning over a plethora of information, as well as access to a certain satellite unit's mainframe. This sole perpetrator had posed as a researcher and escaped with all of this classified intel. They made the connection that, since that top member gained access to certain satellites, they assumed he/she used some kind of jammer to block them from tracking their location after the capture of Patient Zero and fooling the military.

&#x200B;


The man or woman, in question, is known to be a figurehead in this terrorist group and their identity has yet to be verified. The only alias they’ve uncovered is a single name of “Goldstein” and, from what the military gathers, plans on using diseases and even create bioweapons to infiltrate certain military compounds and trigger an apocalyptic event to capitalize on. Surprisingly, over the years this group gained quite the following in the underground world of this country. Ex Secret Service agents and even grunts for the marines were blacklisted and it stated that cults were being formed with agents spreading the influence all over the planet. All targets and enemies of the state. 

&#x200B;


The report also had mentioned a steel mill owner getting killed after speaking to a scientist over a radio transmission, informing the scientist of roof access. Sam is now dead because he tried to tell someone about TNDA. Ray really had overheard one of those assholes telling Sam about the dig and probably more we didn’t know about. Ray, that lucky bastard was at home. I’m glad. Wait until he gets a load of this, I thought to myself. Well, what a Merry fucking Christmas this turned out to be. 

&#x200B;


After reading through all of this Jeff and I stood for a long moment and stared at the computer screen, displaying images of men that had no idea were being photographed, men in suits getting into luxurious vehicles with a security detail, what looked to be a team of researchers or astronauts at NASA, and these monstrous experiments the military conducted on animals and I could clearly see what they did to Patient Zero. They sliced him apart and reattached him time and time again to get their data. Jeff and I decided to just get the hell out of dodge, and we found Sam's old company truck nearby with the keys still in his office. Thank God there was still enough gas in there to just get onto the main road and get out of there. We got in with me driving and took off down the road and passed the burning helicopter.

&#x200B;


Once we made it onto the main road there was a Military Humvee on fire near a trail that snakes off by the main road as well. It was undoubtedly one of their checkpoints that got overrun in case the battle was in their favor and civilians came around. Knowing that this place was housed in the middle of nowhere and people were rarely seen around here, I had to wonder if people could even hear the explosions and gunfire. Or even if the world was listening at all, probably distracted by their phones and devices. If they had thermals watching us from above, they let us escape because I never got stopped, nor did I stop driving until we were far away from that nightmare. This made me wonder even more.

&#x200B;


One thing that stuck out though, is when I took a glance in the rear-view mirror. I almost stopped the vehicle, but before I even had the thought to even slow down, Jeff said something that snapped me back to staying alive.

&#x200B;


"Keep driving."

&#x200B;


After he said this, I only nodded and sped up, because one of our soldiers was standing on the road watching us drive away from the steel mill with his stomach entirely emptied.

&#x200B;


This was over one month ago. I haven’t even watched the news or gone online and just assumed the attack was completely covered up as an accident or something. This is the first time since the ordeal that I’ve been online, and I haven’t heard anything from Jeff or Ray. Jeff asked me to drop him off somewhere near his house after that and I decided to keep moving from place to place. I doubted they would just leave me alone, so I decided on running and keeping that USB port from the soldier with me, for the time being, at least. 

&#x200B;


I’m being followed now. I know it. It was only a matter of time before I either slipped up or they were just able to find me. Unfortunately, like a paranoid moron, I slipped up by using that USB port in my laptop I quickly grabbed from home along with a few important items. I just wanted to confirm again that what I was seeing wasn’t just some hallucination. However, it triggered something... A failsafe or whatever. In bold letters, a message popped up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THIS DEVICE HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I just panicked, smashing the thing and my laptop to pieces right there in the hotel room and quickly darted out of there. I already paid for two nights but it was time to move. I don’t know who to trust. Maybe I should just let the military capture me, but I just panicked and destroyed the USB. Even if the military is trying to get to me, I don’t know if I want that kind of involvement right now after I just destroyed a piece of their equipment and ran from the facility. They have already displayed the carnage and lengths they would go to seemingly cover this up. Imagine what they might do to me. I am not only paranoid but terrified beyond words and have considered just taking my own life after I post the story here. Maybe the military will help, after all. I don’t really know if I want to take any chances. Normally, I wouldn’t take such drastic measures, but I am just a nobody anyway and whatever they have in store for me just might be worse. 

&#x200B;



Before I sign off, I said that I was being followed, sure, but the TNDA or the Military isn’t the only force I am worried about. That thing escaped from the steel mill and there was another topic that went over my head throughout everything I had taken in. These things are capable of infecting a host and the soldier that was being gripped by Patient Zero had to have been completely taken over by now. 

&#x200B;


I keep seeing these people randomly appear before me throughout my time of running. They would be standing somewhere, eerily watching me from a distance. It would be a different person every time. I would notice them, and they wouldn’t move a muscle. They would just remain still with their eyes fixed on me no matter where I would go. I would walk through a crowd of people, drive somewhere, take a risk and grab a bite or a drink somewhere and boom, they would be there. Faces fixed in a blank expression focused on me and only me. Somewhere either outside a window or even close by being mere feet away. If these things somehow perfectly blend in with society, then we need to know. I can’t imagine you would want to be kept in the dark about something like this, let alone fall victim to one of these things and if TNDA somehow captures this monstrosity again, then who knows what might happen.

It's late in the morning and I am currently held up in some shitty hotel room yet again, paying cash and not using my card or real name for anyone to track. I've taken to drinking again and eat sleeping pills like candy every night to attempt at blocking out my night terrors. Wow, I didn’t even realize how long this had gotten. Even so, when you go through something traumatic, re-living the experience can become easy.  I honestly don’t know where else to go and to whoever who actually takes the time and reads this, just know this. Something beyond our wildest imaginations exists out there and there is nothing we can do about it. 





Let this be a warning to those who wonder about the secrets of the world. Lock your doors, give your loved ones a hug and a kiss and remember that danger could be closer to home than we may think. 






Hopefully, someone who can actually help reads this and does something. The world may very well depend on it.
