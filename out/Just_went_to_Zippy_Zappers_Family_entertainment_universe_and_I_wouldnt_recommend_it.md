I didn’t know where else to write about my experience, I wouldn’t think anyone would care, but I needed to let out my frustration so I figured why not complain about it here. If you never heard of Zippy Zappers it’s basically a knock off of ‘Chuckie Cheeses’, it’s a kid themed pizza parlor with arcades, along with it’s cast of furry friends. Instead of a mouse like Chuckies, Zippy is a beaver with large buck teeth and a flatten tail, it’s an arcade so I figured it would be fun for my kids. I have never visited Gray Hills before, this was my first time and the only reason I was here was because I had to tend to my dead aunt’s estate; apparently she left her home to me in her will.  
  
After getting done with the paperwork my kids complained to me that they were hungry but worse they also told me they were bored, if you don’t have kids understand them being bored is one of the worst things in the world for them; so I searched on my phone for anything local and that’s when I found Zippy Zappers. The reviews seemed good, others spoke about good service and food but more specifically people applauded the family entertainment of it all. I figured I would take them there, kill two birds sort of speak, after all, it was only a 5 minute drive away from where I was. This isn’t important to the story but I found it odd that everything is 5 minutes away here in this town, you type in any destination and it tells you it’s a 5 minute drive, maybe my aunt’s home is located in the center of the of the center of town but the premise left me scratching my head as my skin curled from such a coincidence.  
  
Arriving to Zippy Zappers it didn’t look like much, the parking lot looked a bit abandoned and judging from the outside of the venue itself looked withered with dirty windows; I think it would of been safe to say that it was out of business. I apologized to my kids ‘boy’ and ‘girl’, right away I saw their enthusiastic smiles drop, disappointed to the revelation that their boredom would only continue. I felt apprehensive, the inside was too dark to be open, I even got out of the car and walked over to the front windows pressing my face up against it trying to peer in; all I saw was darkness maybe the windows were just too tinted. I started to walk away annoyed that I wasted time coming to this place, the excessive complaints coming from my children pricked at my mind as if I wanted to claw my own eyes out.  
  
I got back to my car angered with frustration, I told my kids that it was closed but then they yelled out to me of how wrong I was, they pointed at the front windows telling me it was open. I turned my head and saw there was now an open sign illuminated with flashing lights, brighter than the sun itself; where the hell did the sign come from? My kids got out of the car before I had a chance to register the bizarre nature of it all, they walked towards the entrance and all I could do was follow in pursuit trying to get their attentions, I knew something was off about this place. They walked in before I could reach them, I called out their names, ‘boy’ and ‘girl’ but they just ignored me, both laughing with such a whimsical care free attitude. They disappeared behind the door and all I could do was follow, retrieve my children and head home back to my aunts.  
  
Walking inside the place seemed normal, a thriving business with flashing lights while music inundated the entire place, the sounds of kids playing mixed into the tracks of old 90’s pop music. I looked towards the counter, a young girl stood smiling, welcoming me with such warmth telling me she saw my kids enter.  
  
“How much for the entrance?” I asked.  
  
Her smile only grew larger with benevolence or perhaps malice, I honestly couldn’t tell, she then giggled and patted me on my shoulder which I found unflattering.  
  
“Silly, here at Zippy Zappers kids play for free”, she said as her voice carried with force into my mind.  
  
I pondered of what kind of business would cater to children only to let them in for free, I felt uneasy, but, too frighten to argue. Instead, I looked around the what seemed to be endless arcade, hoping to catch a glance of my children; I needed to leave I needed them to listen to me.  
  
The place was dark, spotty lights hung above; shining it’s old yellow washed out glow unto the floors while LED lights of all colors blared out of arcades blasting my eyes with such intent, practically burning my retinas to the point I needed sunglasses. I shielded my eyes and called out for my children,  
  
“Boy? Girl?”  
  
No response, no additional voices other than the convoluted sounds of children playing; laughing and in the moment if felt as if they were laughing at me. I walked endlessly in search of my kids, bells and chimes fluttered around me, kids bumping into my legs, how big could this place really be I thought.  
  
“Is everything to your liking?” a voice called out to me, it was the same girl from before.  
  
“I’m searching for my kids” I responded back, but my words fell on deaf ears, no response was given.  
  
That’s when a mystifying question dawned on me, there were no cars outside in the parking lot, the place was desolated, so where the hell did all these kids come from? I didn’t have much time to simmer on the question because my deep thought was broken by an overhead speaker.  
  
“Boys and girls, it’s time, get ready for Zippy!” a raspy gurgled voice called out over the PA system.  
  
Right away the children’s roars came to life as all of them screamed in unison from utter excitement, chants of Zippy echoed all around as I rotated in all directions trying to gather my balance from the horrid scene. A spot light glared bright showering a small stage center of the room, the brightness washed out all other light leaving me in pitch darkness, I couldn’t even see my own hand in front of me.  
  
“Boy! Girl!” I shouted out once again, all to eager to leave this nightmare of a place.  
  
On stage stood a red curtain, it swayed left to right as if someone was pulling on it and soon a bizarre creature emerged from behind, it’s hideous appearance resembled what I believed was an over sized beaver. It’s teeth larger than its head, glimpses of a red substance oozed down the serrated edges and it’s fur matted into a whirl of disgusting proportions. Though my horror wasn’t met the same by the children instead they cheered out in pure ecstasy from the sight of the monster. It paraded out on to the stage with such a comical dance, it bumping around like some imbecile lost and then it began to sing a song. The kids all applauded at the monsters theatrics but the innocent fun was short lived, the beaver then called out to the audience, asking if they wanted to see a magic trick, cheers followed the kids all to indulged in the idea of being entertained.  
  
From behind the curtain the creature brought out another adult, a middle aged man that trembled with terror, he was gagged and tied, the man was the first adult I had seen in this forsaken place. The beaver then began to perform it’s trick if you even wanted to call it that, there wasn’t much magic to it, the monster picked up the man with ease and hovered him over it’s head, it then opened up it’s grotesque large mouth, gaping open big enough for the man to enter and like magic he disappeared into the welcoming jaws of the beast. The children giggled and applauded, they demanded more, they wanted another magic trick and all the beaver could do was dance around while veering out into the audience for another participant.  
  
Somehow the spot light found me, it showering me with it’s sinister illumination, the beaver pointed at me and demanded me to come on to stage. I waived my hands in defeat, too frighten to even move an inch but the beaver only angered, it’s menacing eyes turned a bright red indicative of how much it wanted me to come to it. The children moaned out in displeasure and soon I felt little hands forcefully pushing me up on to the stage, their strength beyond comprehension, soon I was mere feet away from the beast and that’s when I heard my kids call out to me. Their voices more angelic than ever before and the entire arcade came to a crashing halt, all noises becoming void.  
  
“Boy! Girl!” I called out.  
  
Then they said the words that brought pure music to my ears, words that most likely saved my life, they told me, ‘they wanted to go home’.  
  
The hands that were forcing me on to the stage disappeared, the laughter and giggles seized, but more importantly the monster on stage waived goodbye to me with it’s huge paw. I ran towards my children some how I could see them in the dark and I gathered them up in my arms running towards the exit. Before leaving the young girl from the counter told me to have a ‘nice day’, but more disturbing, she then told me that she would see us next week. I didn’t bother driving back to my aunt’s home, I left there and then from Gray Hills not bothering to stop for any of our belongings that we left behind.  
  
I still get invitations to return to Zippy Zappers, I usually just delete the emails, though I don’t ever remember signing up for any newsletter. Either way I plan on never going back, I recommend all who entertain the idea of taking their kids there to stay away. Also the customer service was poor, I was never offered any food of any kind, I would rate it one star.
