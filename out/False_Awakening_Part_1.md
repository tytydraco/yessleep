I dreamed of it again. That building. Its features have become so distinct to me by now that I even now see it outside of my sleep, like a waking dream, with its front porch leading directly to me. It seems inviting somehow, almost daring me to enter the realm behind that wooden door. I know it sounds insane, and even writing it down now I question my own sanity. This is all out of context for you though. Let me start from the beginning.

It all started exactly five days ago. I was hanging around my third-floor apartment, just about to make myself some dinner when I heard a sudden knock at the door. I wasn't expecting any visitors obviously, so I went and opened the door to see who was rapping at my door. To my utter surprise, it was my father's attorney. Shocked, I invited him in, and we began to get to the bottom of his mysterious and sudden visit. "Your father has passed away." He said, his words piercing the air of curiosity, and replacing it with an air of grave seriousness. I never did get along with my father. He was a paranoid asshole, and I hadn't even talked to the man in years. About 10 years to be exact. "His wish was for you to inherit your childhood home." He continued. His words shocked me even more than the news of my father's demise. Last time I talked to my father he gave me the impression that he would rather burn that house to the ground then see it in my possession. "You're sure you've got the right guy?" I asked. He reassured me, and even read out my father's will. I couldn't believe it. Why did he have such a change of heart? When did he make the decision? Did he even think to update it after our last altercation? My silent questioning was interrupted by the the attorney. He had gotten up and was heading for the door. "Wait!" I yelled. "What am I supposed to do with this?" I pleaded, praying for an answer. "Don't know, and I don't care." Came a callous response from the man, now turning the knob and preparing to exit. "If I were you, I would try to push it onto some other poor sap."

His advice made sense to me. I had no desire to keep the place. All my memories of that accursed building invoked an almost rage-like state the more I thought of them. I thanked the man as he left my apartment, and I went back to my previous engagements. That night I had the oddest dream. It was like one of those dreams where you can't tell if you're awake or asleep. This was followed by the oddest realization. I was in a forest. Before me lied a log cabin, the layout of which was oddly familiar to me, compared to the untamed wilderness around me. It looked like a single floor building with a porch immediately outside the front door. It had a rail and to the right of the door were two chairs on either side of a medium sized window. I felt compelled to see what lie inside the house, though my view inside was obstructed. There was a large tree to the right of the cabin, its limb hanging in such a way that it obscured my view into the window. All I could see was that there was a light on inside the cabin, though there was something that almost felt wrong about its quality. I moved to get a better look, but immediately upon the first twitch of a muscle I jolted awake. Upon waking that day something felt off. I couldn't quite tell what it was, but that wasn't even the focus of my attention at the time. There was a feeling that seemed as though my entire body and my entire consciousness were working in tandem to protect me from something. I know that sounds stupid, but that is the only way I could describe this feeling. This was all but immediately pushed out of my mind though, as when I looked at my alarm clock, I was shocked to see I was late for work. I hurried to get ready and headed off to work.

I went to work that day, trying to banish last night's dream from my mind. It all but worked until I got home to see someone had taped something to my door. I quickly looked around, and I could not see anyone. This was actually really odd because normally my neighbor would normally get home around this same time. We had many conversations through the years as we were both entering our respective abodes. I dare say it was through these that we even became friends. My mind was torn again from my reminiscing when I reached my door. It looked like someone had taped one of those really large orange envelopes to my door. I was reasonably concerned by this development. Nobody had plans to drop anything off, and it couldn't have been the post office, as I had a mailbox right downstairs. I hesitantly grabbed the envelope and began scanning it, hoping to find something on its exterior that alluded to the identity of its deliverer, but all I found were some odd-looking shapes. I walked inside to try and see if I could find out what on earth was going on. I looked for a few hours, but to no avail. I think it may have been some sort of like a cipher or something, but I wouldn't even know where to start with all that. The only reason that comes to mind is one of my best friends in high school was really into that stuff, and I just remember when he would show me some of the ciphers, they looked like a completely different language to me. Anyway, I debated with myself for another like thirty minutes on whether or not I should open up that mysterious envelope, but at the end my curiosity got the better of me. I opened it up, and what was inside shocked me to my core.

It was a blueprint, but not just any blueprint. It was a blueprint of my childhood home, the one that I had just yesterday been informed was now under my possession. Needless to say, I was creeped out. I didn't even know how someone would get access to these blueprints. I decided to look them over a little clearer, and upon further examination, there were some oddities on these blueprints. There were rooms on that blueprint that I DO NOT remember being there. Some background, I am 29 years old, and last time I was in that house was about 10 years ago. I didn't explore the house much when I was older, but as a child I made it my mission to know that place front and back. I knew every single crevice of that house. Granted it has been a really long time since then, and I am almost one hundred percent sure most of my knowledge of the place is all but lost, but I think I would have remembered several entire rooms. I wasn't sure if they were fake or of some other similar house, but there was one way to find out. I had to go back there.

I debated going to the house that day, after all how could I know what any of this means if I didn't find out why someone had given me these blueprints. I will admit, I had my reservations about going back to the place. My memories of the place are not fond, but the feeling of not knowing was worse than reliving all of that. I decided I was going to call of work the next day, and I was going to go to the house that night. I needed to know why my father handed the house over to me, why the blueprints were on my door, and I needed to find out what the connection of that odd dream was to this whole scenario. I have no proof yet of that last point, but everything in my being is telling me that these series of events are definitely connected. So, I packed up an overnight bag and I headed out. I was in the car for about four hours before I got to the house. I was tired as hell, and I was ready to be rid of all this weird stuff. I arrived at the house at about midnight, and when I got there, what I saw looked like a whole new property. I couldn't understand why the lawyer had called me a "poor sap." I had imagined that he was referencing the recent passing of my dad, but upon looking at the house that night I had understood why he said that.

The house was overgrown. It looked like no one had even taken the slightest bit of care of the place since I left. I thought about how hard it was going to be to sell the place and how much work I was going to have to do if I were going to sell the place. I began to unpack my bags, and I swear I'm not a paranoid man, but I could swear that when I got into the house and unpacked my overnight bag, I saw someone out the window of my old bedroom. I was sure there wasn't anyone out here, the house is in the middle of nowhere. I quickly ran down and turned the lights on. My old bedroom faces the same way as the front door, which leads to a porch, so I turned on the porch lights as well and began to scan the area in which I spotted the figure. Nothing. I must've stood there staring for about an hour, trying to rectify the discrepancy between what my eyes were looking at and what I thought I had seen, but there was no one there. I chalked it up to sleep deprivation, mostly because I hadn't slept much in the last week, but I was on edge the rest of the night. Work had been incredibly busy for the last month, so I wasn't sleeping very well. My mind then refocused on the idea that I hadn't slept well in the past week, and for the first time in the last couple days, I began to look forward to something. I was looking forward to getting a good night sleep. I turned off the porch light and went back upstairs. That wasn't the last weird thing to happen that night.

It was the middle of the night. I had long since gone to sleep, and I must have been in a pretty deep sleep. I woke to the sound of my phone ringing, though it must have only been for a second, because when I looked at my phone it had since stopped ringing. I looked at the number, but I remember thinking it was impossible that I was getting a call from *that* number. It was a number I was very familiar with, because it was a number I had memorized when I was a kid. This one was special though. Just as I had come upon that thought, my attention was the drawn away from my phone by a sound so faint, that I couldn't even convince myself that I had heard anything. If that were the end of it, then I would have just brushed it off and went back to sleep, but something else then caught my attention. My eyes had to adjust from the light of my phone to the pitch black of the room around me. I scanned the room so many times, that I swear I could draw a map of the dark room, but on the last scan something caught my eye. I don't even know if I could call what I saw a silhouette because it blended in so well with the rest of the dark room. I tried to focus on it, and as I did, the sounds of crickets began, and it got really intense. I had become so engrossed in the sound of crickets that I failed to notice that the thing was moving, and it looked like it was moving toward me. It was so weird and looking back now, I couldn't be sure I was actually even awake. The image of that cabin had flashed in mind, and suddenly I was sitting up in my bed in a cold sweat, but it was day now. I looked at my phone, and it was ten o'clock in the morning.

I checked the fridge for anything edible before I would begin the arduous task of confirming whether or not the blueprints I had received were accurate or if my recollection of the old place was as on point as I hoped it was. Of course, there was nothing in the fridge. It looked like no one had gone to the grocery for months. There was spoiled food everywhere, so I shut the refrigerator door, and I decided I would make the thirty-minute drive into town to grab something to eat. As I walked out of the house into the front yard, and at this time, the full scope of the degradation of the house truly came into view. The roof looked like it was sinking in a few different places, and the wood around the sides of the house were pealing as well. The lawn was overgrown, almost to the point that it looked oddly out of place for the house to be where it was. With the realization of how much work was truly ahead of me, I left to go into town. It was a fairly pleasant drive for the most part, but about halfway to town, I noticed something. There was a car that was behind me for a while. I saw it pull behind me not long after I left the house, and it had been behind me for about twenty minutes. Just as I focused in on it, the car disappeared. I'm aware of how this sounds, but it was gone. I even pulled over and looked around, but to no avail. Things were getting odd now, and I wished only to banish the oddities that had surrounded my life for the last day. I got back in my car, and I finished my drive into town. I went to a diner that I remembered from my childhood, and I even, to my surprise, saw an old friend of mine while I was there.

I had walked into the diner, and as I was going to sit down, I saw a familiar looking man, and he must've seen me too, because before I knew it, he walked up to me and said, "Danny it that you? It's been a while. How have you been?" I soon recognized the man as my childhood best friend Rick. We sat and had brunch. We caught up on what had happened in the last decade, and I filled him in on why I was in town. "Oh shit, man. I know you and your old man didn't get along, but I'm really sorry to hear about that." He said, though I think we both knew the news hadn't exactly been heartbreaking. We finished up our meal and went outside. I don't know why, but I told him about my odd experience the night before. We got to the point where I mentioned the call I had believed I received, and more importantly the number it had come from. He was dumfounded, and he repeated the same rationales that I had told myself. "Surely it's just a wrong number. I'm sure that number was reassigned years ago." He said shakily. I agreed, but I'm sure it seemed like I was trying to convince myself of the explanation than reaffirming his belief. I finished up my story, and we said our goodbyes. We went our separate ways, and I prepared myself for the work to come.

I did my explorations that day starting from the top floor. It was an attic area of sorts, so it didn't take long for me to check out that area. There appeared to be no new rooms either on that floor or on the blueprints I had received, but you better believe I checked every nook and cranny of it.

I moved on to the second floor, which should have been more interesting, as there were supposedly two new rooms on this floor. I checked for both of them, but neither seemed to be there anymore, not that I would know if they were still active anyway. I had no idea what I was doing or even how I was supposed to do it. You see in the movies how easy it is to stumble onto a secret entrance or accidentally move a book that reveals a secret room behind a bookshelf, but in real life, or at least in this specific scenario, it wasn't that easy. I soon gave up my pursuit of the rooms and moved on to the first floor, but with not much more luck. Defeated by my failure to find any trace of these rooms, I decided that I was going to start some general cleanup around the house. I had just finished up sweeping, when I came upon a big spill across some bricks on the fireplace that sits in the middle of the living room. I grabbed a rag and began to clean up what I hope was just some ketchup or something. I started going at it, when one of the bricks started moving. I was confused. All the bricks in that fireplace look as solid as can be, even after the wear that a lack of cleaning had bestowed. Just then my focus was drawn away from the brick and onto something in the fireplace. Something had just opened. I quickly looked into the fireplace. I moved the cradle in the middle of it, and to my sheer surprise, and horror, there was an opening. It looked like a trap door had just opened up and there was a light on in the space that had just opened up. I knew what I had to do. Something inside me knew that I was meant to find this. I took a deep breath and began my descent beyond the threshold of this new opening into the realm below.
