I dreamed of it again. That building. Its features have become so distinct to me by now that I even now see it outside of my sleep, like a waking dream, with its front porch leading directly to me. It seems inviting somehow, almost daring me to enter the realm behind that wooden door. I know it sounds insane, and even writing it down now I question my own sanity. This is all out of context for you though. Let me start from the beginning.

It all started exactly five days ago. I was hanging around my third-floor apartment, just about to make myself some dinner when I heard a sudden knock at the door. I wasn't expecting any visitors obviously, so I went and opened the door to see who was rapping at my door. To my utter surprise, it was my father's attorney. Shocked, I invited him in, and we began to get to the bottom of his mysterious and sudden visit. "Your father has passed away." He said, his words piercing the air of curiosity, and replacing it with an air of grave seriousness. I never did get along with my father. He was a paranoid asshole, and I hadn't even talked to the man in years. About 10 years to be exact. "His wish was for you to inherit your childhood home." He continued. His words shocked me even more than the news of my father's demise. Last time I talked to my father he gave me the impression that he would rather burn that house to the ground then see it in my possession. "You're sure you've got the right guy?" I asked. He reassured me, and even read out my father's will. I couldn't believe it. Why did he have such a change of heart? When did he make the decision? Did he even think to update it after our last altercation? My silent questioning was interrupted by the the attorney. He had gotten up and was heading for the door. "Wait!" I yelled. "What am I supposed to do with this?" I pleaded, praying for an answer. "Don't know, and I don't care." Came a callous response from the man, now turning the knob and preparing to exit. "If I were you, I would try to push it onto some other poor sap."

His advice made sense to me. I had no desire to keep the place. All my memories of that accursed building invoked an almost rage-like state the more I thought of them. I thanked the man as he left my apartment, and I went back to my previous engagements. That night I had the oddest dream. It was like one of those dreams where you can't tell if you're awake or asleep. This was followed by the oddest realization. I was in a forest. Before me lied a log cabin, the layout of which was oddly familiar to me, compared to the untamed wilderness around me. It looked like a single floor building with a porch immediately outside the front door. It had a rail and to the right of the door were two chairs on either side of a medium sized window. I felt compelled to see what lie inside the house, though my view inside was obstructed. There was a large tree to the right of the cabin, its limb hanging in such a way that it obscured my view into the window. All I could see was that there was a light on inside the cabin, though there was something that almost felt wrong about its quality. I moved to get a better look, but immediately upon the first twitch of a muscle I jolted awake. Upon waking that day something felt off. I couldn't quite tell what it was, but that wasn't even the focus of my attention at the time. There was a feeling that seemed as though my entire body and my entire consciousness were working in tandem to protect me from something. I know that sounds stupid, but that is the only way I could describe this feeling. This was all but immediately pushed out of my mind though, as when I looked at my alarm clock, I was shocked to see I was late for work. I hurried to get ready and headed off to work.

I went to work that day, trying to banish last night's dream from my mind. It all but worked until I got home to see someone had taped something to my door. I quickly looked around, and I could not see anyone. This was actually really odd because normally my neighbor would normally get home around this same time. We had many conversations through the years as we were both entering our respective abodes. I dare say it was through these that we even became friends. My mind was torn again from my reminiscing when I reached my door. It looked like someone had taped one of those really large orange envelopes to my door. I was reasonably concerned by this development. Nobody had plans to drop anything off, and it couldn't have been the post office, as I had a mailbox right downstairs. I hesitantly grabbed the envelope and began scanning it, hoping to find something on its exterior that alluded to the identity of its deliverer, but all I found were some odd-looking shapes. I walked inside to try and see if I could find out what on earth was going on. I looked for a few hours, but to no avail. I think it may have been some sort of like a cipher or something, but I wouldn't even know where to start with all that. The only reason that comes to mind is one of my best friends in high school was really into that stuff, and I just remember when he would show me some of the ciphers, they looked like a completely different language to me. Anyway, I debated with myself for another like thirty minutes on whether or not I should open up that mysterious envelope, but at the end my curiosity got the better of me. I opened it up, and what was inside shocked me to my core.

It was a blueprint, but not just any blueprint. It was a blueprint of my childhood home, the one that I had just yesterday been informed was now under my possession. Needless to say, I was creeped out. I didn't even know how someone would get access to these blueprints. I decided to look them over a little clearer, and upon further examination, there were some oddities on these blueprints. There were rooms on that blueprint that I DO NOT remember being there. Some background, I am 29 years old, and last time I was in that house was about 10 years ago. I didn't explore the house much when I was older, but as a child I made it my mission to know that place front and back. I knew every single crevice of that house. Granted it has been a really long time since then, and I am almost one hundred percent sure most of my knowledge of the place is all but lost, but I think I would have remembered several entire rooms. I wasn't sure if they were fake or of some other similar house, but there was one way to find out. I had to go back there.

I debated going to the house that day, after all how could I know what any of this means if I didn't find out why someone had given me these blueprints. I will admit, I had my reservations about going back to the place. My memories of the place are not fond, but the feeling of not knowing was worse than reliving all of that. I decided I was going to call of work the next day, and I was going to go to the house that night. I needed to know why my father handed the house over to me, why the blueprints were on my door, and I needed to find out what the connection of that odd dream was to this whole scenario. I have no proof yet of that last point, but everything in my being is telling me that these series of events are definitely connected. So, I packed up an overnight bag and I headed out. I was in the car for about four hours before I got to the house. I was tired as hell, and I was ready to be rid of all this weird stuff. I arrived at the house at about midnight, and when I got there, what I saw looked like a whole new property. I couldn't understand why the lawyer had called me a "poor sap." I had imagined that he was referencing the recent passing of my dad, but upon looking at the house that night I had understood why he said that.

The house was overgrown. It looked like no one had even taken the slightest bit of care of the place since I left. I thought about how hard it was going to be to sell the place and how much work I was going to have to do if I were going to sell the place. I began to unpack my bags, and I swear I'm not a paranoid man, but I could swear that when I got into the house and unpacked my overnight bag, I saw someone out the window of my old bedroom. I was sure there wasn't anyone out here, the house is in the middle of nowhere. I quickly ran down and turned the lights on. My old bedroom faces the same way as the front door, which leads to a porch, so I turned on the porch lights as well and began to scan the area in which I spotted the figure. Nothing. I must've stood there staring for about an hour, trying to rectify the discrepancy between what my eyes were looking at and what I thought I had seen, but there was no one there. I chalked it up to sleep deprivation, mostly because I hadn't slept much in the last week, but I was on edge the rest of the night. Work had been incredibly busy for the last month, so I wasn't sleeping very well. My mind then refocused on the idea that I hadn't slept well in the past week, and for the first time in the last couple days, I began to look forward to something. I was looking forward to getting a good night sleep. I turned off the porch light and went back upstairs. That wasn't the last weird thing to happen that night.

It was the middle of the night. I had long since gone to sleep, and I must have been in a pretty deep sleep. I woke to the sound of my phone ringing, though it must have only been for a second, because when I looked at my phone it had since stopped ringing. I looked at the number, but I remember thinking it was impossible that I was getting a call from *that* number. It was a number I was very familiar with, because it was a number I had memorized when I was a kid. This one was special though. Just as I had come upon that thought, my attention was the drawn away from my phone by a sound so faint, that I couldn't even convince myself that I had heard anything. If that were the end of it, then I would have just brushed it off and went back to sleep, but something else then caught my attention. My eyes had to adjust from the light of my phone to the pitch black of the room around me. I scanned the room so many times, that I swear I could draw a map of the dark room, but on the last scan something caught my eye. I don't even know if I could call what I saw a silhouette because it blended in so well with the rest of the dark room. I tried to focus on it, and as I did, the sounds of crickets began, and it got really intense. I had become so engrossed in the sound of crickets that I failed to notice that the thing was moving, and it looked like it was moving toward me. It was so weird and looking back now, I couldn't be sure I was actually even awake. The image of that cabin had flashed in mind, and suddenly I was sitting up in my bed in a cold sweat, but it was day now. I looked at my phone, and it was ten o'clock in the morning.

I checked the fridge for anything edible before I would begin the arduous task of confirming whether or not the blueprints I had received were accurate or if my recollection of the old place was as on point as I hoped it was. Of course, there was nothing in the fridge. It looked like no one had gone to the grocery for months. There was spoiled food everywhere, so I shut the refrigerator door, and I decided I would make the thirty-minute drive into town to grab something to eat. As I walked out of the house into the front yard, and at this time, the full scope of the degradation of the house truly came into view. The roof looked like it was sinking in a few different places, and the wood around the sides of the house were pealing as well. The lawn was overgrown, almost to the point that it looked oddly out of place for the house to be where it was. With the realization of how much work was truly ahead of me, I left to go into town. It was a fairly pleasant drive for the most part, but about halfway to town, I noticed something. There was a car that was behind me for a while. I saw it pull behind me not long after I left the house, and it had been behind me for about twenty minutes. Just as I focused in on it, the car disappeared. I'm aware of how this sounds, but it was gone. I even pulled over and looked around, but to no avail. Things were getting odd now, and I wished only to banish the oddities that had surrounded my life for the last day. I got back in my car, and I finished my drive into town. I went to a diner that I remembered from my childhood, and I even, to my surprise, saw an old friend of mine while I was there.

I had walked into the diner, and as I was going to sit down, I saw a familiar looking man, and he must've seen me too, because before I knew it, he walked up to me and said, "Danny it that you? It's been a while. How have you been?" I soon recognized the man as my childhood best friend Rick. We sat and had brunch. We caught up on what had happened in the last decade, and I filled him in on why I was in town. "Oh shit, man. I know you and your old man didn't get along, but I'm really sorry to hear about that." He said, though I think we both knew the news hadn't exactly been heartbreaking. We finished up our meal and went outside. I don't know why, but I told him about my odd experience the night before. We got to the point where I mentioned the call I had believed I received, and more importantly the number it had come from. He was dumfounded, and he repeated the same rationales that I had told myself. "Surely it's just a wrong number. I'm sure that number was reassigned years ago." He said shakily. I agreed, but I'm sure it seemed like I was trying to convince myself of the explanation than reaffirming his belief. I finished up my story, and we said our goodbyes. We went our separate ways, and I prepared myself for the work to come.

I did my explorations that day starting from the top floor. It was an attic area of sorts, so it didn't take long for me to check out that area. There appeared to be no new rooms either on that floor or on the blueprints I had received, but you better believe I checked every nook and cranny of it.

I moved on to the second floor, which should have been more interesting, as there were supposedly two new rooms on this floor. I checked for both of them, but neither seemed to be there anymore, not that I would know if they were still active anyway. I had no idea what I was doing or even how I was supposed to do it. You see in the movies how easy it is to stumble onto a secret entrance or accidentally move a book that reveals a secret room behind a bookshelf, but in real life, or at least in this specific scenario, it wasn't that easy. I soon gave up my pursuit of the rooms and moved on to the first floor, but with not much more luck. Defeated by my failure to find any trace of these rooms, I decided that I was going to start some general cleanup around the house. I had just finished up sweeping, when I came upon a big spill across some bricks on the fireplace that sits in the middle of the living room. I grabbed a rag and began to clean up what I hope was just some ketchup or something. I started going at it, when one of the bricks started moving. I was confused. All the bricks in that fireplace look as solid as can be, even after the wear that a lack of cleaning had bestowed. Just then my focus was drawn away from the brick and onto something in the fireplace. Something had just opened. I quickly looked into the fireplace. I moved the cradle in the middle of it, and to my sheer surprise, and horror, there was an opening. It looked like a trap door had just opened up and there was a light on in the space that had just opened up. I knew what I had to do. Something inside me knew that I was meant to find this. I took a deep breath and began my descent beyond the threshold of this new opening into the realm below.

I was baffled at what I found in the hidden depths. It was a room that was almost a carbon copy of the one just above it. I quickly looked around the place to see if I could find anything off, anything that would give me any hint as to why this room was hidden. What I found terrified me to my core. It was a picture of the house from my dreams. I couldn't believe it; I wasn't even sure the thing was real up until this point, and I was now looking directly at a photograph of it. What's more, I lifted up the photograph and found a map. It sounds really dumb, but it had a big "X" on it. I gathered that this was where I needed to go. I started looking for any sort of marker identifying where this place was, and I found a set of coordinates on the back of it. I knew what I had to do. I had to go and find this place.

I did some more cleaning around the house the rest of the day since I still fully intended on selling the place, but I couldn't shake the image of the cabin from my brain. I was getting ready for bed somewhere around eleven o'clock. I had finished brushing my teeth, and I was about to get into bed, when I saw something out my bedroom window. It was a black figure, with what looked like glowing red eyes. I know I've said this a lot, but I feel the need to say it again: I know how insane I sound. Hell, I don't even know how someone would even get up to the second-floor window that led to my bedroom, but I could see it clear as day. I stared at it for what seemed like an eternity, but the second I blinked, it was gone.

I tried my best to sleep that night, but it was not easy. Eventually I did manage to get to sleep, and I actually slept pretty well that night. I woke up the next morning with a weird feeling. It was one of those feelings that you can't describe why, but something just feels off. I got up and got dressed, and then I went down to the first floor. I had a weird urge to go outside, and when I got outside, I was scared senseless. It was the building. The one from my dream. I tried clearing my eyes, even tried pinching myself, but nothing was changing what I was seeing. There was a very heavy uneasiness inside me, but against my body's better judgement I began walking toward the mid-sized cabin. The closer I got to the cabin, the more everything inside me was screaming to turn around and run, but there was no way I could do that. I finally reached the door, and I turned the knob. I was blinded by a bright light, and I heard a familiar, female voice I never thought I would hear again say, "Danny? Is that you?" Just as this was all happening, I woke up in my bed.

I was so confused as to what had just happened. That dream felt so real. Was I still dreaming? What was happening, and why couldn't I open that damn door? Why was her voice coming from behind it? "It's impossible!" I thought to myself. "She's been dead for almost three years." I tried to not let the bewilderment of that night's dream affect my day, but at this point it was near impossible. I packed up my stuff that day, and I began a trip that I would soon regret. I was going to go to the coordinates I found on that map, and I was going to find out what was happening. I grabbed my keys and left the house. I put the coordinates into my GPS, and the location popped up as a place in the middle of the forest in Vermont. It was about a twenty-hour drive, so I went to get supplies for the drive. As soon as I had the supplies (a few energy drinks and a few days of snacks) I left on my journey.

I got back into the car after walking out of the grocery store, but something started feeling off. I looked around but saw nothing. I looked into my rearview mirror, and what I saw shocked me to my core. It was the same black figure. Despite it being the middle of the day, the figure still looked almost like a shadow. Terrified, I started my car and threw it into drive, my heart beating out of my chest whilst doing so. I laid on the gas, and as soon as I began moving, it was almost like we teleported. I was now staring down a dirt road in the middle of a forest. I checked my rearview mirror and the figure was gone, but as I turned back to see where I was headed, I drove straight into a tree.

I woke violently in my driver's side seat, the groceries right next to me. I have analyzed this moment thousands of times in my head, and I still can't remember falling asleep. I must have been asleep for a long time though, since when I gathered my thoughts, the sun was already setting. Something was happening to me, and I couldn't figure out what was going on. I knew one thing for sure though. I needed to get to this place, and I needed to get there soon. Just as I began preparing for my journey though, I looked at my forehead and saw a nasty gash right across it. These dreams were no longer just dreams, but something else. It was no longer just my sanity on the line I feared, but my life as well.

I began the long drive to the location, and with the help of those energy drinks, I soon almost reached my destination with no incident. About five minutes before reaching my destination, I entered a long dirt road. It was the same one I had seen in my dream. I was driving down it for only a minute, when the dirt road suddenly stopped. I could go no further in my car. I got out and put my keys in a backpack I had packed back at my childhood home. I began to walk, but as I entered the dense woods before me, my phone began glitching. I'm not talking about the kind of glitch where you just lose service and can't get directions, but the kind where your phone just becomes unusable. In utter fear, I hit the thing against my hand, but to no avail. I knew I would have to just start walking and hope that I was going the right way. I began walking, and the deeper in I got, the more I got the feeling I was being watched.

I walked for about ten minutes, and that's when I saw it. It started with a familiar looking creek, but when I kept walking, I saw it.

The cabin was right in front of me. It was an older looking, unkept cabin with a set of stairs leading up to a porch and a front door. There was a window off to the right side. I was half expecting myself to wake up any second, but the closer I got to the building, the more I was sure this was the real deal. Terrified, I began inching closer. I was almost on the first step to the porch when I saw a deep orange light flick on inside the window, and a terrifying sight came into view. It was a dark figure with what looked like bright red eyes, and it was staring right at me. I stopped in my tracks, the fight or flight question firing off in my head, but after a few moments of deep breaths, I was able to calm myself enough to slowly and shakily make my way to the door.

I grabbed the handle, still expecting myself to wake up at any moment, but I would have no such luck. As I grabbed the doorknob, I had the sudden urge to turn around, but I would soon regret this decision. Inching toward me from the tree line were three mangled beasts. One resembled a leopard, one a lion, and one a wolf, but they were all horribly disfigured. The leopard had a missing bottom jaw, a missing eye, and its legs looked like they had been reformed after going through a meat grinder. The lion looked like it had been caught in a forest fire. Its skull was visible on half of its face where it looked like the flesh had burned away and its mane was singed almost completely gone. The Wolf was the most terrifying, brandishing three heads, each emitting a rotten stench and dripping white foam.

I rushed to open the door. I didn't know or care what was on the other side at that point, I just needed to get away from these hell creatures. I slammed the door behind me and turned around. I focused in to see something that was incredibly odd. There was no window, there wasn't even a room. there was just a long dark hallway that seemed to lead to an orange light reminiscent of the one I saw in the window. I didn't know what else there was to do, so I began walking down the hallway. As I inched closer, I began to see what looked like cells along the walls. I reached into my bag and grabbed a flashlight I remembered I had packed. I quickly turned it on to look inside the rooms, and what I saw made me stagger back, and almost made me vomit. There were grotesque creatures inside these rooms, each containing human features, but none of which I could classify as human.

Each creature was different, but each one was equally as disgusting as the last. One had ears all over its body, another had no eyes at first glance, but upon further investigation its eyes were in its hands, and it was pointing those hands directly at me, and was making a noise I could almost describe as a grunt. I looked at another that was obese beyond what I thought the human body could handle, and it was sitting in the corner, seemingly unable to move. Just as I got turned away from the grotesque creature, I saw something that terrified me far beyond what I thought was possible.

I looked down the hallway to see a creature now standing in the way of the light. It looked humanoid at first, but then it began to shift its appearance. Across the hallway I could hear the cracking of bones and what I think was the sloshing of muscles. Its appearance had changed so much that the once humanoid creature now looked like nothing I had ever seen before. It looked as if the creature now brandished the skull of what looked like a deer with the antlers protruding. The creature was now also about six feet taller, now coming out to about fifteen feet tall. I then heard something that sent chills down my spine. "Danny? Is that you?" echoed down the hall in a familiar, female voice, one that I hadn't heard for years before the dreams started. It was the voice of my dead girlfriend, who had died in a tragic drunk driving accident about three years ago.

I froze. I didn't know what was going on, only that my heart was now beating so hard that I swear it was beating out of my chest. The creature tilted its head and began moving toward me. I tried everything in me to move, but I couldn't. As it got closer, I could see its almost ashen skin. Its red eyes grabbed my attention as well. Was this thing the thing that had been taunting me for the last five days? It continued to get closer, and as it did the smell came into range. The creature smelled of rotting meat, but I was still so frozen I couldn't even gag. It was now running on all fours toward me, but I still couldn't move. It must have been almost ten feet from me when I was finally able to force myself to move. I began slowly but surely inching my way toward the door. Whatever was on the other side was surely better to face than whatever this thing was. My knees were trembling so bad that I couldn't manage much more than a slow jog, but the thing was gaining on me. I finally reached the door, but the thing was only a mere foot away.

I threw the door open and forced myself through the door. I slammed the door, but it caught on something. The creature's massive, clawed hand had made it through the door, and it had now grabbed my backpack. I wrestled myself away as hard as I could, and eventually I made my way free of the creature's grasp. To my surprise it quickly retreated its hand back inside the god forsaken building, but I wasn't about to stick around and find out why. To my utter surprise, the beasts were also gone. I took the opportunity and ran. I ran so fast, and for so long that it felt like my legs might give out below me. I finally caught view of my car, and I shut myself inside it, locking the car as I entered.

I was exhausted. I scanned the area, and there was nothing that I could see, but that didn't mean anything at this point. I decided it didn't matter at this point, and I quickly fell asleep.

I dreamed of it again last night. That accursed building now stains my subconscious. I never wanted anything to do with that building or its contents again. That was until I checked my backpack to see that there was now a large hole in the back. The contents had likely emptied themselves on the porch, and I now knew exactly why the creature had retracted its massive, clawed hand. I searched for hours, but my keys are gone.
