I work at a hotel at the end of the world.

You probably think I mean I work at a hotel in the middle of nowhere―that would be incorrect. 

Then you assume I mean a dumpy room-and-board where you stay when your wife kicks you out for the seventh time―again, incorrect. 

What I mean is that I quite *literally* work at a 4-star establishment at the edge of the whole wide world, on a cliff overlooking the blank, black void of eternal nothingness, from which disembodied voices screech on the blackest of nights. Oh, and from which *moderately perturbed* voices moan on the not so blackest of nights.

Before we get started, some ground rules. First, I'm not here to confirm or deny the whole flat earth theory, so don’t even ask. Just. Don’t. 

Second, I can't tell you where the hotel is located. Sorry, my uncle included that as a clause in my employee contract. 

Third, I may change certain names and dates to protect the identities of our guests, because of HIPAA and FERPA laws and such (or was it FURBY laws?). In all honesty I'm not 100% sure those apply to bellhops. 

Frankly, the only reason I’m writing this is because the usual night receptionist got Mono from kissing the entire kitchen staff at one of the summer parties, and my uncle’s having me fill in for a few weeks. It gets boring at night with nothing to do. Real boring. I thought I might as well write about one of the weirder repeating guests who tried to check in a few nights ago.

Weird is a spectrum here. Quite a few of the guests would fit into that category, but some more than others. We do get lots of your typical guests: humans on business retreats, lost hikers, blood-eaters on family vacations. 

But we also get a lot of things coming to die, like people with terminal cancer or spider people whose legs are already starting to curdle inwards. Don't even get me started on the amount of elderly *dogs* that hobble in here coughing up blood. As my uncle explains it, like calls to like. Things at the end tend to seek out other ends, for example hotels constructed at the teetering edge of the precipice of nothingness.

Things crawling here to die are so common there's a whole chapter in the employee handbook on it. It covers things like disposing of the bodies, and what to do if they’re taking longer than expected to kick the can, and smart times to throw things into the void vs. times that might aggravate the things in it to come out―blessedly, cleanup is cousin Lenny's job. I don’t get paid enough for that.

I’m getting off track. The guest.

This was a few days ago, but it was two, maybe three, in the morning when the automatic front doors slid open. I looked up from my book―Crime and Punishment for those interested―but nobody was there. The doors just do that sometimes.

They slid open and closed two more times. I stopped bothering to look up.

When it happened another few times, though, I figured it was time to call maintenance or manually lock them myself. I set down the book, and―

The man with only a mouth stood right in front of the desk.

Okay, I know that sounds ominous, referring to somebody by a vague spooky description, but the only reason we didn’t use a name is because he’s never given us one. Probably that has to do with his lack of ears, eyes, or usual mode of receiving questions such as “hey, what's your name?” Just one overlarge, smiling mouth. 

Nobody, not even my uncle, has ever been totally sure if he can hear us, though he usually tends to get the drift when we tell him, “Get out of here. Rooms are for *paying* customers.”

I’d never actually turned him away before, but I’d seen others do it enough times to copy what they usually said.

“No face, no service.”

He stood there smiling.

“I’m serious,” I said. “No freeloaders. Anyways we’re all booked for tonight.” A lie.

He leaned towards me across the counter.

“Look.” I lowered my voice. “This is my first week at the front desk. I’d really love if my uncle decided to make this promotion permanent, meaning no incidents on my watch.  Can you kindly leave like usual? *Please*?”

I waited a few seconds, then, “I’ll even throw in a complimentary personal toothpaste.”

The man with only a mouth smiled wider, slid the toothpaste off the counter, then walked back out the automatic doors. *Easy*. 

I grabbed one of Uncle’s Dr. Peppers from the employee fridge to congratulate myself on a job well done. I could do this receptionist thing. Maybe my luggage-lugging days really could  be over. A three dollar an hour raise and a desk job? That would be the life.

The rest of my shift continued without issue. I signed off at eight in the morning and checked myself into one of the spare rooms to crash the next few hours until my next shift started at noon (one of the joys of family business: crappy work schedules you can’t say no to.)

The blackout curtains were pulled tight. The AC was clunking away. I’d nearly drifted off when my eyes jerked open.

Something was wrong. I could sense it.

It took a full minute of laying there still, listening, to realize what it was. Every time I breathed, something breathed with me. It wasn’t a perfect match. There were slight inconsistencies to it, like an echo, enough I was absolutely sure. 

Something was next to me in the bed.

It was nearly pitch black with the curtains, but the glow from the bedside clock shed just enough light for me to shift to my side and make out the glint off a set of perfect, smiling teeth. The man with only a mouth stared at me.

*Stared* in a hypothetical sense of the word, that is.

He was on his side, facing me, inches from my own face, on the open side of the bed. 

*Waiting*.

I yawned as if merely readjusting positions and forced my eyes closed. As much as I wanted to spring from the bed and run for the door, I couldn’t. I was stuck here. Pretending to be asleep. Feeling his breath on my face.

You see, this has happened before. 

Even if the man with only a mouth *did* offer to pay for a room, we probably wouldn’t let him. My uncle has a pretty strict ‘no murdering the other guests’ policy that the man has broken more than a few times over the years. 

The nights he shows up we make sure every guest has only the exact amount of bed spots they need in their rooms. Four guests? That would be two queens. One guest? A single twin. Somebody in your party dropped out at the last minute? You’re getting a different room.

If there’s any spots leftover or any empty beds, the man with only a mouth views it as an open invitation. Some of the less human visitors operate by less standard rules than people do. This is just one of his. 

If it’s just an extra bed in your room, it’s not so bad. Guests usually report a faceless man grinning at them from under the sheets but no deaths. If it’s an open spot in your own bed though?

Let’s just say the reports are more on the *cannibalistic* side of that spectrum.

If you were thinking about lying about your guest count on your next visit to avoid the upcharge, this is your gentle reminder that honesty always results in less blood.

Before you call me an idiot in the comment section for booking myself a room that would break a rule I already knew about, my defense is this: I thought it only applied to guests not employees. 

Turns out this was an *everyone* rule. Whoops.

I lay there for ten-ish minutes. The whole time my eyes stayed closed. Those always went first from the reports. Eyes, then the ears, next the nose, and then the rest of you. All of it sliding through those wide, pearly-gated jaws.

“Pretend you’re asleep,” my uncle’s told me before. “He never does anything until the guest wakes up.”

But of course every guest *does* have to wake up eventually. What would I do? Pretend to be asleep forever? Ridiculous.

Well, that’s what I tried. It was actually working, I’ll have you know, all up until something long and slimy lapped at my nose.

I let out a gentle snore.

The tongue probed down the arch of my nose.

I sleep-stretched.

The wet thing moved with me. It fingered (tongued?) each nostril with impatience. The man with only a mouth wanted to speed things along. Even with eyes closed, I could imagine that smile under the covers beside me. 

As much as I wish I could claim unfaltering calmness in the throes of the tempest, I was about a sneeze away from gonzo. The tongue was just entering my left nostril, and no, *absolutely* not, that was *not* about to happen, no sir―

Somebody knocked on the door.

I threw off the covers and bolted for it.

“Room service,”  my cousin, Frances started, then realizing it was just me, “oh.”

“Hey!”

“You’re supposed to book this under Uncle’s name if it’s just for a break between shifts,” he told me.

“Syrup on the sheets,” I said. “A guest must have left it open. It’s dripping everywhere.”

Frances eyes’ sprung open. “What? Where?”

I led him in, to the entirely empty bed. He leaned over, examining it…

I shoved him over and pinned him down.  

“Hmmmprf!” he started, face full of pillow, but I cut him off.

“Man with only a mouth.” I climbed in beside Frances. “He was just in here a second ago. Sorry, I couldn’t risk him coming back while I explained.”

“Ah come on! Janitor crew was already short staffed. I was assigned this whole floor by lunch.”

“Eh. Nobody knows when you’ve changed the sheets anyways.”

Then I pulled the blankets back over me, and Frances (still grumbling) settled in for an early nap.

See, you can’t cut your stay short if you invite in the man with only a mouth. He knows the bookings, and as we always explain to our guests who demand a room change, he does *not* like your stay going short. Sleep until you were planning.



Okay, it’s almost six in the morning, and people are already starting to check out. I’ll end there, but let me know if there’s any questions you want answered for my next post. I’ll try to write during my upcoming night shift.

Oh, and please, *please* remember. One day you might decide to come visit the hotel at the end of the world. Maybe it will be for a family vacation. Maybe your doctor’s just given you an unpleasant diagnosis, but whoever you are, whatever the reason may be, this is your formal reminder about one of our most important rules.
