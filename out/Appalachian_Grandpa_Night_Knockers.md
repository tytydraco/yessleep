This year we had a rare treat for Halloween.


Instead of a white Christmas, we had a white October thirty-first instead.


Three days before Halloween, the region had a terrible blizzard roll through, covering everything in an early-season snow. It did little to dampen the spirits of the Trick or Treaters, though we definitely saw more costumes with thick pants and coats than usual. Grandpa and I sat bundled up on the front porch, passing out candy as we always did, and Gramps was in high spirits indeed. He had finally kicked the cough he had kept him down most of the summer, and as I watched him handing out sweets, I hoped he wasn’t about to have a flare-up again. We still had plenty of the stuff they gave us for the breathing machine, but getting him to take it was like pulling teeth.


He noticed me watching him, and rolled his eyes, “Don’t worry, son. If I start feeling peaky I’ll go inside. Let me have my fun. Who knows how many more Halloweens an old man like me has in him.”


He smiled as he said it, turning back to fill the bags of the shivering kids with treats, but we both knew there was honest dread beneath the words. 


There would, indeed, come a day when there was no Grandpa to fill the bags of the kiddos with the best the Walmart candy aisle had to offer, and I kind of hoped I wouldn’t be around to see that day either.


This place just wouldn’t be the same without Grandpa to make it home.


The moon was round and full as it shone over the porch, and as the last of the trick-or-treaters crunched through the snow, we headed back inside with decidedly empty bowls.


“Not bad for a snowbound Halloween,” Grandpa commented, pouring the last of the candy into the bowl by the door that he kept for guests.


“I was surprised that so many came out,” I commented, locking the door and running the chain, “I thought for sure that the snow would keep them away.”


“Not a chance,” Grandpa laughed, the toilet flushing as he finished his business, “Mountain kids wouldn’t miss out on free candy for anything. They’ve got too much Halloween spirit for that.”


I had turned to agree with him when a slow and ominous knock swung me back towards the door. It seemed odd, that knock, though I couldn't have told you why. It wasn't the quick and happy knock of a late-night treater. It wasn't the knock you heard from a kid at all. This was the slow and ominous drone of thick knuckles on wood, the low pounding of someone who hadn't had a good night's sleep in years. I looked through the frosted glass on the front door, but the knocker was a hazy outline in the semi-opaque screen.


It was adult-sized and man-shaped, but even looking at it made me shudder.


The posture reminded me of a corpse, and despite my internal radar pinging like a fish finder, I found I was still reaching for the knob.


My numb fingers had reached for the chain when those knuckles dropped lazily against the door again.


At long last it hit me as the chain slid sideways, the metal scraping eerily, what those bones sounded like as they rattled the door.


I had never heard the noise before, but it had to be an exact match.


I tried to resist the pull of courtesy, the draw of hospitality that came from a lifetime with my parents, fore my better judgment knew that something terrible lay on the other side of that door, and it would be better to leave it cold and the snow.


The rapping of those knuckles sounded like fingers drumming on a coffin lid, and I knew without a doubt that this visitor was not of this world.


Grandpa caught me by the wrist as my hand closed around the nob, and I was very glad he had.


"Don't open that door, boor. That's not a guest we want in here."


The knock came a third time as we stood deliberating it, and when it turned slowly from the door and walked away, I breathed a sigh of relief.


"Don't celebrate yet," Grandpa said, putting the chain back up and drawing me away from the door, "It's only just begun now."


"What it is?" I asked, not even asking how he'd known it was malicious. That had been no straggling Trick or Treater. I had felt it through the door, but still I had felt obligated to offer it hospitality. When someone knocked, after all, and especially when it was cold out, you let them in. It was polite, if not a little foolish on my part.


"A night knocker," Grandpa said, "They usually only come on snowy winter nights, but I suppose a restless spirit on Halloween is fitting somehow."


"Night Knocker?" I asked, jumping a little as a new knock came from the backdoor. Through the glass, I could see the shadowy figure lurking, and the light from inside the house did little to illuminate him. He raised his hand to knock a second time, and the glass shivered under the bony tonk tonk tonk of his gnarled old fist.


"Wandering spirits who try to gain entry into a home. Night Knocking used to be a profession of sorts, or so I've heard, and I imagine that more than one of them has likely tricked their way into a home that's used to answering a deputy checking for unlocked storefronts. They used to work for the sheriff in rural areas, checking doors and locking up behind forgetful shopkeepers, but these fellows are a little less altruistic."


It finished its third knock while we were gabbing and I heard it move off across the back porch and towards the woods.


"It's not done yet, boy," Grandpa said, taking the kettle from the sink and, as if he had conjured it, the thing tapped on the window in the living room hard enough to rattle the frame. 


"You've encountered them before then?" I asked, turning to look in the direction of the knocking.


"A few times. They aren't very common, but they appear now and again. Don't pay them any mind, boy. If they think you're scared of them, they tend to stick around longer."


He added hot cocoa to the kettle, along with milk and some cinnamon, and put it on the stove as he switched the burner on.


"Grandma told me about them when I was younger, said they gave her a real fright when she was around my age. Have I ever told you that story?" he asked, grinning as he slid me a chair, "I suppose I haven't, or you would have known what the night knockers were. It appears we have some time for a story if you'd like to hear it."


I nodded, watching as Grandpa stirred some honey into the pot and poured us each a cup full as the contents began to bubble. The knocker had moved onto the front porch again, tapping at windows with its stony old knuckles, and as he moved around the house to find more windows within reach, Grandpa took a testing sip of his hot chocolate. I found mine to be perfect, not too sweet but not too hot, but Grandpa must not have approved of his. He took another spoon of the mix and stirred it in, smacking his lips as he tasted this time.


"Perfect, now, where was I? Oh, yes, it was a night much like this, and I was staying with Grandma during a frosty January Blizard. 




My parents had gone out of town, a sort of second honeymoon for their eleventh wedding anniversary, and Grandma and I were spending a month together in her little cabin. A storm had blown up about a week after my parents left, and by the second week, we were well and snowed in. Why they had decided to take a trip right after Christmas was beyond me, but school was canceled and it was just Grandma and I on our own. She had laid in food for the winter like she always did, and we were eating stew and fresh bread when a knock came on the door.


It wasn't the knock of a normal person.


It was slow and rhythmic like someone just letting their fingers fall against the wood.


I didn't know how anyone could be out in weather like this, but as I rose to answer the door, Grandma stopped me.


"Don't," she said, getting up to check the lock before closing the curtains on the windows. 


"But what if it's someone who needs help?" I asked, worried they would freeze out there.


"It isn't," she said, "It's no one that we can help, anyway." 


"What do you mean?" I asked, getting a little scared as the knocking sounded against one of the nearby windows.


"It's a Night Knocker," she said, "A restless spirit that wanders and looks for people to let it in."


"What does it do to them?" I asked, my voice higher than usual as my terror crawled up my throat.


"No one really knows. The ones who do, don't live long enough to talk about it."


She saw that her words really weren't much of a comfort, and switched gears.


"Luckily for you, it's only one. When I was about your age, I had a whole bunch of them come to your great-grandmother's house while I was there alone. Would you like me to tell you about it?"


She had gone to the woodstove and put on some tea, the kettle already thumping as the water got good and hot. She didn't have any cocoa, very few people did around here at that time, but she had ginger tea and warm honey and soon she had a cup of it in my shivering hands and was beginning her own story. The knocker was moving from window to window, testing each with his bony knuckles, but as she started her own story, I almost forgot about him.


"It was March and momma had gone out to try and get some supplies. Daddy had been stuck in the mines for about a week, snowed in as the sight was waist-deep in powder, and Momma and I were on our own. The food had begun to run low, and Momma had left to see if anything in town was open so she could pick up some supplies. We had boiled the last of the oats for breakfast, and the kettle of soup we had made from the ham and remaining vegetables was down to the bottom of the pot. Momma had left around noon, saying she would be back before dark, but dark had come and Momma was still gone."


The fire cast my grandmother in a ghostly cloak, and I was caught in the spell of her story as she laid out the peral of her snowbound home for me. 


"This wasn't the first time I had been left home alone, far from it, and I was busy preparing the middlings of what we had set aside for dinner. There were only a few eggs and some grits left for breakfast, and after that, we really would be down to eating shoe leather. I was adding to the small soup stalk we had, mostly boiling vegetables when someone knocked at the door. I thought it was my mother, and I had my hand around the knob before I was hit with the most overwhelming sense of dread. I had learned a little from my mother about the unseen world, and I was acutely aware of its presence even at eleven. I heard it knock again, and it took all my will to remove my hand from the doorknob. Not only was I drawn by the pull of generosity and custom, something that runs deep here in Appalachia, but there was an undeniable draw to let whatever it was in.


After the third knock it moved away, and as the pull dwindled I breathed a sigh of relief.


When another knock came at the door, mirrored by a similar knock at the window, I jumped in surprise and looked over at the window that looked out from the den. 


There was a man-sized shape there, its fist raised to knock again, but the dimensions were wrong. It was like a living shadow, its thickness seeming temperamental, and when it moved away after the third knock, another took its place and knocked again. Now there were three of them, knocking at the windows and the door. They were circling the house, and as they knocked, I felt my breath hitching as my panic rose. It was like an ever-expanding circle, the knocking moving a round and a round. I thought maybe it would stop when they had enough to knock on all the windows and doors, but then others began to tap on the walls and on the roof too. 


The clamor was too much, and I put my hands over my ears as I prayed to God to make it stop.


As I stood there sobbing, asking the almighty to help me, the voice of my own Grandmother echoed in my head.


"The good lord helps those who help themselves, June bug. You have the tools, you have the knowledge, so don't bother that man with your troubles. He has bigger fish to fry."


I realized she was right and began to chant a little spell my mother had taught me. It rolled off my tongue like warm tea, and as it did, the knocking began to decrease in volume. Suddenly they were no longer banging on the roof. Then the knocking on the walls stopped. Slowly, the knockers on the windows dispersed, and finally, the two on the doors ceased as well. 


It was so quiet, so still, that when a single knock came at the door, I screamed like a tea kettle and nearly dropped in fright.


"June? June! It's momma. Open the door, June Bug. I have groceries and the snow has my feet numb!"


I cried out with joy. It was momma, she was back, and when I gripped the knob I felt nothing but the love and worry she had for me. I threw my arms around her, tears streaming down my face as I told her what had happened. She came inside, locking the doors and saying how sorry she was for being so late. She had made it to town and got the groceries, and when Mr. Argy offered her a ride in his wagon she thought for sure she would be back before dark.


"Only, I must have gotten turned around after I got out at the foot of the mountain, 'cause the next thing I knew I was nearly tumbling into Mr. Goldways holler!"


We unpacked the groceries and then she made tea and explained the Night Knockers to me.


After that, I felt a lot better, as I suspect you do as well."


As I drank my tea and listened to her story, I realized that the knocking had stopped.


Grandma had distracted me with a story long enough for the Knocker to get bored and leave on his own.


I kept an ear out for them after that, but I never forgot the power of stories when one is under great emotional stress.




I sipped my cocoa as Grandpa finished, and realized he had done the same for me.


I didn't know when the knocking had stopped, but the only sound in Grandpa's house was the sound of the clock as it ticked the evening away.


"I guess telling stories is something that runs in the family," I said, finishing my cocoa before going to wash the cup in the sink.


I didn't have to see Grandpa's smile to hear it in his voice as he said, "We won't know till you have some grandchildren of your own, I suppose."


I poured another cup of cocoa and sat sipping it as I listened to the wind blow and the snow powder around the house, glad to be inside with Grandpa and his wonderful tales.


From Grandpa's house to yours, we wish you a very Happy Halloween.
