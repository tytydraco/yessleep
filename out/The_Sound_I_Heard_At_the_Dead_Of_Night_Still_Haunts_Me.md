*I was suddenly woken up at 4:32 am in the morning by the sound of something hitting the ground outside my bedroom.*   
*I fully expected it to be the new vase composed of plastic- long, slender, unconventional, which could have fallen as it was kept on a minimalistic shoe rack, but, anyways I got up to check, knowing my alarm would ring in just half an hour. As I got up, the sudden anemia hit me like a drug dose.*  
*I wobbled trying to take support of the wall and my nightstand, as my vision entered the world of an endless variety of patterns and shapes, similar to that of a kaleidoscope. After struggling for what seemed like a few minutes, I reached out towards my nightstand, feeling around for my specs.*  
*Surprisingly, i couldn't find them. I tried to recollect when I could have left them, but I couldn't think of anything substantial.*   
*I quit the search for my glasses and walked towards the switch board to switch the lights on in order to have better vision while searching for my glasses. You see, the window in my room faces the south direction.*   
*I know, it's stupid, so, minimal moonlight enters through it at night and as the nail in the coffin, it was a new moon today, so moonlight was far from ready to reach my room. I pushed my palm towards the wall side of the switchboard, realizing each attempt of switchboard-searching that I wasn't anywhere near it.*   
*I had half expected to have memorized where the switchboard might have been by now, as I had moved in this house 2 months ago,  but my memory seemed to have betrayed me.*  
 *Out of the blue, something hit me. Not “hit me” hit me, but the act of sudden recognition or realization. The sound I had heard was eerily similar to the sound of meat hitting the ground. How do I know that? For 20 years or so,*   
*I had worked for a mortuary as it was administered by our family. I left that job after my uncle passed away and I left my sister to handle it.*

 *This sudden realization left me astounded. It was unexpectedly something I had heard within my house. To be very clear, I live very much alone. Within my house, as well as in my neighborhood.*   
*The nearest neighbor lives 2 kilometers away from my location. It was close to impossible that it was a human body falling to the ground that could have caused that sound. But it was possible that it was a burglar…if he was very bad at his job.*   
*Now, frantic, I opened the door just enough to peek through the crack in the door to look at the empty and serene hallway. I couldn't find anything out of place among the darkness of the night. I was anxious to find what it could be, then again I could have just imagined the sound, maybe a recollection of the many times I had to handle a corpse, then again, day by day, hearing has caused me many problems.*   
*I was completely dazed in my over-the-top thoughts as I heard a second thump on the ground. My body was ready to shrivel up as a chill ran down my weak spine. I was right. It WAS the sound of a body hitting the ground.*   
*I was nowhere in hell curious to know what it was. At that moment, I was fascinatingly more eager to stop sweating a bucket load of sweat and calm down to assess my situation.*   
*I ran a wet towel on my face and finally took to investigating the sound after hiding in my room like a 10 year old. To be completely honest, a 10 year old would most likely beat me in a bravery contest.*

 *I remember crying at the sight of bodies being carried and put inside those inhuman, cold and poorly made metal assortments where the bodies would rest until their inevitable burial. I mustered up the courage to finally open the door and step outside.*   
*I walked through the hallway, creeping towards my kitchen with the slightest tip-toe. I stood a few steps before the entrance, looking around to see if I could spot anything unusual or any of the burglary signs. He or whoever it could have been probably left after taking some stuff. I was a bit relieved that I didn't have to deal with them, and a bit sad for the things I could have lost, but I paid no mind to it as within those thought spans I noticed the sound yet again. Thump, it went.*   
*As I located the area from where the sound came from. I began to sweat profusely. It was my room. My bedroom. The same place I had gotten up from due to that very sound. A tear ran down my face as I realized that i had been in the same goddamn room as that sound.*   
*Why didn't I notice it earlier?? Did the thing or person enter my room after I got out searching for it?? Did it get in my room while I looked for my glasses? Or was it in there with me all along….An array of scenarios went through my head as I unconsciously walked back towards my room. I didn't even notice myself moving until I had reached the very door I had opened to see the hallway from. I couldn't do this anymore. My mind was too weak for it. As I looked at the door, I saw a slight crack from the door. A crack in the door that I didn't leave. And through the crack, I saw a pair of eyes staring right back at me.*
