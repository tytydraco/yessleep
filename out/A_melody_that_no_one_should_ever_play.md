I’m a freelance composer. I write music for video games, mostly indie projects. Retro soundscapes, dark ambient loops, exploration themes. Nothing unusual.
Until last month.

A small Eastern European studio reached out. They wanted a track for a psychological horror game set in an alternate Soviet Union. Their exact request:

“Make it faded. Mentally invasive.”

I said yes, obviously. I live for weird prompts.
But when I started working on the main harmonic progression… something went wrong.

I was sketching out a descending sequence. The melody that came out was unlike anything I’d written. It sounded… dirty. Metallic. Rusted. I didn’t write it. It found me.
It just spilled out of my fingers.

The second time I played it, I felt a jolt of vertigo. Like when you get up too fast and your body forgets where it is.

I thought it was a fluke. Took a break.
But every time I touched that sequence again: the same feeling. Chest pressure. High-pitched ringing.
And something shifting in my peripheral vision.

Then came the dreams.

Three nights in a row.
Rooms with no windows. Walls breathing, pulsing in sync with an impossible melody.
A voice whispered in a language made of sighs and mourning.
I’d wake up mid-scream with my nails bloody.
I don’t know if I bit them in my sleep…
Or if I was trying to dig something out.

I dropped the project. Deleted the files.
But the melody stayed with me.
Gnawing.

I started researching. Dug into music theory forums, spectral audio databases, weird Reddit threads, banned dissonance archives.
Nothing. No match.
Nobody had ever used this combination of notes.

Then I tried numbers. Converted the notes into digits. Looked for patterns. Posted on math-music crossover boards. On forums about sonic mysticism. Even some occult groups.
Still nothing.

So I went deeper. Into the deep web.
I never go there.
But something was pulling me forward.

And there it was.
A dead site. One post. No homepage.
Just a single, untranslated Russian entry.
Dated 2002.
Anonymous.

I ran it through a translator.

It told the story of Vadim Chernikov, a Soviet radio hobbyist who, in the 1980s, intercepted a strange numbers station.
A monotone, guttural voice repeated the same 27 digits.
Six loops.
Then silence.
Exactly 27 hours and 27 minutes later, the loop would start again.

Vadim tried to decode it for months.
Finally, he had the same idea I did—but in reverse.
He turned the numbers into music.
Used a diatonic scale. Played the pattern on his old, broken piano.

What came out was… beautiful.
But wrong.
Twisted.
He couldn’t stop listening.
He dreamed about it. Heard it when no sound played. Hummed it in public without realizing.

Then came the unraveling.

Paranoia. Sleepless nights.
Hallucinations. Scribbles of symbols.
He spoke of portals.
Frequencies that bent space.
Overlapping dimensions.

He isolated himself.
Went mad.
And died alone.

His belongings were found by a distant cousin.
Among them: 30+ notebooks filled with gibberish, reminiscent of the Voynich Manuscript.
Experts couldn’t decipher them.
But in every single one, one word appeared repeatedly in Cyrillic:

НЕВРИН
Nevrin.

The post called the melody “The Nevrin Scale.”
A cursed progression. A sonic formula that, when played, opens something.
No one knows what.

Since I read that post, the melody came back.
But now… I don’t have to play it anymore.

I hear it in the hum of the fridge.
In the static between radio channels.
In whispered conversations in cafés.
In the silences between words.

The site had a MIDI file attached.
14 kB.
Named nev27.mid.
It loops the 27-note sequence endlessly.

I haven’t opened it.
I don’t think anyone should.

The sound lives in me now.
And if you've read this far... maybe it's already started humming in you too.
