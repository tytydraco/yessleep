Investigators Note:

The Following is a Collection of the Grim Chapters, a series of memories collected from the -REDACTED- event in -REDACTED- Oregon. Ouroboros Investigators were able to assemble and transcribe the memories into text format utilizing the -REDACTED- to compile the -REDACTED- from various intact samples taken from the site. Readers will note that the compilation is split into several points of view including but not limited to a local law enforcement agent, a local teen aged resident, and the Grim brothers themselves. Whilst Timothy Arthur Grim and his brother Daniel Robert Grim represent the bulk of the collection, it is important that the reader note that, due to the nature of the -REDACTED-, our samples cannot be taken without a grain of salt. The associated dementia casts many details of the accounts into question, along with the understandable biases of the individual subjects. Take caution as prolonged exploration of the accounts in question have led to associated symptoms of dementia investigators believe to be related to the -REDACTED-

Gods Need to be Fed

Chapter 1- Tim

It didn’t take much time for me to realize home wasn’t home anymore. Bumming rides from Portland to Elgin got us as far as Pendleton, but it was in passing through the Dalles in Keaton’s old Subaru Hatchback that I fully grasped the mistake I had made. The impulse had been, in my mind, a rational decision based in very recent trauma. Elgin was home, too dense pancakes and overcooked hashbrowns at Mo’s, family, Dan. That had been a lie, a cope, the seed of a thought planted in my head by dad a lifetime ago. The truth was that to me, the world had ended overnight, and returning to Elgin was a desperate attempt to find something familiar, something safe. The car jolted, shaking me from my thoughts.

“Damn…” Daniel grumbled, lip curling down into a deep frown. “These roads need some work, the fuck am I paying taxes for?” His brother shook his head slowly, chewing his cheek. His hair was dark and cropped close, his face lined and rough, carved from oak just like their father.

“I didn’t think you paid taxes.” I joked, giving him a sideways look. He was Older than me by 6 years, but it might as well have been 100.

Dan smirked in the way that he did, eyes narrowing. “I pay some, shit I pay more than you.” He chuckled.

“You make more than me.” I pointed out, shifting in the seat uncomfortably, trying to ignore my aching ass. The Chargers leather seats were stylish, but uncomfortable.

“Not hard to do, college boy, what did you major in, Jazz-Tap?” Dan laughed, nodding at his own cleverness. The car rumbled as it passed over old train tracks. I peered out the window, trying to look down the tracks like I used to as a kid, but the rain running in sheets across the glass turned the view into a kaleidoscope of green and grey.

A frown crept across my face, “Economics actually…” I said, trying my best not to sound arrogant, that would be blood in the water for a guy like Dan.

“Ah yeah, numbers, well good, you can take a look at my books, save me some trouble with Uncle Sam.” Dan seemed to approve, although as ever it was difficult to tell, he was like dad in that way.

“Yeah, I mean I’m not a tax expert,  but I can take a look.” Cracking the window as I spoke, the fresh air had a calming, almost nurturing quality.. Dan had picked us up in Pendleton for the home stretch, and whilst Keaton's Subaru had been an ugly old horse, Dan’s Charger, whilst pretty, had a busted ac.

Dan smirked, “50 grande and you ain’t a tax expert?” He shook his head, “Maybe that comes with the deluxe package, 100 grande gets you tax expertise and a free trip to Cabbo.”

“College kids don’t really go to Cabbo anymore, you need to update your jokes.” Looking out the window, miles of green passed inconsequentially as I spoke. Water gathered on the lip of the window and began to steadily spray my face with cold droplets, but it wasn’t a bother.

“No more Cabbo? Thought all you college kids loved Mexicans?”

Rolling my eyes, I chose to ignore the Mexican comment, “Nah, Bali is the hot spot now.”

Dan frowned, “Don’t they make movies, Bollywood or something?” Before I could correct him, Dan slugged me in the arm with a chuckle. I nearly yelped as the bastards knuckles raised what was definitely a fresh bruise on my arm.

“I’m fuckin with you, even country bums like me have access to the internet.” Dan grinned.

“Yeah, to the detriment of everyone else.” I spat, turning away with a grunt.

Dan shrugged. “I’m gonna tell my 4chan buddies how you feel, they won’t be too happy, maybe they’ll dox you.” He mused.

Scoffing, I wheeled back on him, “I’m moving in with you idiot, have fun dealing with creeps showing up at the house.”

Dan turned and smiled as though he relished the thought. “I’m a second amendment purist, I’d be tickled to see them try.”

My prepared retort caught in my throat, and I couldn’t help but smile at that. Dad had always nurtured in us what he called a “healthy” distrust of the government and authority figures. To hear Dan tell it, I had held my first pistol before I was potty trained. Hunting and shooting with dad and Dan was a mixed bag of memories, but the culture had been one thing I sorely missed in Portland.

“Hey, I know it’s kind of recent, this whole Heather thing, but that Keaton girl, she was kinda cute?” Dan fixed him with a searching look, lips pursed.

Shrugging, I could feel my pulse quicken at the mention of Heather. “Yeah I mean, they’re alright, a good friend.” I said, trying my best to sound disinterested, preferring the conversation end there.

“They?…”

“Yeah.”  My voice dropped sternly. “They.”

Dan turned his head to watch the road, nodding slowly with a look of surprise on his face. “Portland truly is the Wild West.” He said after a moment.

Deciding to ignore him, I turned back to check on Howie.  He had been quiet for most of the trip, most of the last month if I was being honest. At some point between Pendleton and Elgin he had fallen asleep, auburn hair mussed up from the seat, mouth slightly open as he snored softly. I smiled sadly and turned away, sighing heavily. Some father I am.

“I need a smoke, ima pull off before we get to town.” Dan said, an invite to join him wrapped into the tone of his words. We pulled right into an empty rest stop just outside of town, a light drizzle fell as we exited the charger. Shivering, I pulled up my hood and took a cigarette and lighter from Dan, lighting a smoke and inhaling deeply before returning the light.

Dan lit up and sighed, blowing out a soft cloud of smoke and mist. “Almost home…”

Nodding, flicking the smoke, I watched as the pale ashes fell to the cement and became sodden.

Dan nodded slowly. “How do you feel about that?” He asked, much to my surprise.

“We talkin feelings now?” I took a puff of my smoke, eyes still fixed downward on the puddle beneath my feet, watching as the ashes dissolved lazily.

“No, I mean, maybe, ain’t that what city boys do?”

“I’m NOT a city boy.” I insisted, more roughly than intended.

Dan frowned but didn’t get upset. “I know, I just thought…” he shrugged, “10 years is a long time Timmy, people change.”

“Yeah…” I frowned, slightly embarrassed at his small outburst, but unwilling to show it, especially not to Dan. “Most people don’t though.”

“That’s true, so how about you?” Dan asked, taking another long draw on his cigarette. “D’You change?” Dan watched me with eyes that came dangerously close to concern.

Needless to say, I was baffled, taken aback. Dan was a hard ass, just like dad had wanted. Jon Grim had raised his boys to be survivors, fighters, providers, men. Whenever he wasn't drinking the old man would use every opportunity to teach some “lesson” on the importance of traditional masculinity. When he was drinking, those lessons came with bruises. While I should have been happy, impressed even at my brothers attempts at compassion, really I just wished the fucker would drop it. I had been subject to nothing but compassion and tears and empathy and sympathy and all that other bull shit that people were supposed to express when someone’s partner died. My hopes were that, among the minimal benefits presented in returning to Elgin, not having to receive condolences or soft words of comfort would have been one of them. I'll die before I thank another person for their kind words.

Crushing my cigarette into the wet cement with a hiss, I gave Dan a weary smile. “I’ll let you know when I find out…”


The drive into town was as uneventful as the town itself. Elgin Oregon, on the border of the Umatilla reservation and nothing else, was home to a little more than 1000 of Oregon’s finest, men women and children just like Dan. Surrounded in dense woodlands and nestled within the steep mountainous terrain reflective of the greater blue mountains. A land of Motor bikes, meth, and Mo’s hotcakes. Home. 

The EZ Pump was lonely in the early evening, the already limited daylight rapidly retreating behind rain clouds and fog banks. The pump rattled and hummed as we gassed up, Dan leaned against the car and waited, whistling low, while I sat in the car scrolling instagram mindlessly with the door open, yawning and clearing my throat.

“Daddy, can I get a snack?” Howie asked, his small voice pulling me from the scrolling.

“Yeah bud, what do you want?” I asked gently, fixing my kid with as warm a smile as I could muster.

The six year old pursed his lips as he thought, “A Little Debbie please?” He asked with a small smile.

“A little Debbie what?”

Howie shrugged, “Little Debbie anything.” He clarified. Very specific.

Chuckling, I straightened up and slid out from the bothersome leather seats. “Alright, one little Debbie anything, coming up.”

“And a soda!” Howie called out as I made my way toward the station.

“Water!” I tossed back, smiling, satisfied at the boys' protestations.  Walking up to the building, I was stopped at the door by a teen who looked like he had seen better days.

“Hey sir, I’m stuck with no ride, can you spare some cash so I can pay a buddy for gas to get home?” The kid asked, voice raspy. At a glance, he had the glazed look and burnt smell of a kid who had a lot of access to cheap weed and not much else. Classic Oregonian.

“No sorry…” I started to say, then looked at the kid, seeing him truly for the first time and recognizing the pizza faced boy. “Cole?” I asked, dumbfounded. He was scruffy and grubby as anyone multiclassing teenage boy and pan handler, but narrow face, beak of a nose, and watery blue eyes didn’t lie. “Cole Hewitt?” I asked again.

Cole looked at him warily. “Yeah. Do I know you?” He responded, frowning.

“Knew, I’m Tim, Dan Grim’s brother.” I said, trying my best to make the connection make sense. “I left when you were 8, my brother deployed with your dad.”

Sudden realization passed over Cole’s face, and perhaps even recognition. “Oh man, I haven’t seen you since Mary Whitcoffs funeral, you had a faux hawk.” He said with a smirk. I squashed the sudden urge to punch the kid.

“Yeah don’t mention the faux hawk.” I said with an embarrassed smile. “Anyway, my brother is here with the car, if you're cool with kids we can give you a lift?”

Cole gave an apologetic smile. “Yeah, I mean that's awesome and I really appreciate it, but uh…” he looked around as if to check for watchers, “I’m gonna be real man, a few of my buddies and I were gonna hike up to Duncan, shoot the shit, maybe have some beers, I was just trying to get a 4 Loko, or maybe some Truly’s.” He blushed, caught.

“Oh…” Embarrassed, I stuffed my hands into my hoodie. Should have figured, but I’d been so caught up recognizing the kid that the implications had eluded me. “Alright um…”  Pulling a stray 10 from my pocket, I stuffed the bill into Cole’s hand. “Get home safe.” I said with a smile and a nod, leaving the thankful teen outside to continue the little Debbie quest.

Each aisle was lit by bright fluorescent lighting that made the store seem almost sterile, despite the obvious layer of dust and grime. Looking through the little Debbie’s, I cringed as each offering seemed to be an even more hedonistic union of chocolate and creme filling. Finally, in spite of difficulties, I settled on an Oatmeal Creme Pie, probably because, in my mind, oatmeal was a healthy breakfast.

Ringing up the treat along with a bottle of expensive water, I recognized Mel Acres, the owner of the EZ Pump, pushing 80, but still operating the register.

“Hey Timmy boy…” Mel said warmly, the leather like skin of his face sitting into a dazzling white smile as he spoke. “How long has it been son?” He offered his arm.

“10 years.” I answered, grasping the old man’s arm with a firm squeeze. “How’s James?” I asked, remembering running up and down these same grossly lit aisles as kids. James Acre, Mel’s grandson, had been and would always be my best friend.

“Jimmy’s good, Oscar Tores opened up an auto shop in the old fire station, brought Jimmy on as an apprentice, last I heard he was hired on as a full time mechanic, boys so busy I only ever see him at the pump.” The old man chuckled throatily.

Nodding, I squeeze his arm again before letting go. “Well, I got Dan waiting outside with my kiddo, so Ima get outa your hair, you’ll tell Jimmy I came around?”

Mel nodded and accepted his payment, pushing the change into my hand. “He’s gonna be up at your guys’ property before the sun's down, you bet on it.” He chuckled. As I was nearing the door, he shouted again. “You tell your brother that he still owes me for the Propane I brought to the funeral, your daddy was a decent man, but not nice enough for me to go out of pocket.” 

“I will.” I said, face suddenly red. Damnit…

The funeral was 4 years ago. I had gotten out of it by claiming to be staying home with Covid, and with Howie only being a toddler at the time, Dan hadn’t pressed the issue. “When I needed to come home, after Heather, Dan had accepted me back without any hesitation.” The thought bounced around my head like an old dvd screen saver.

No, that was bull shit. Heather was my partner, damn near wife, the mother of my child. Jon Grim was an asshole drunk who would have been lucky to have anyone attend his funeral. It isn't the same, and I'm not gonna let myself feel bad for missing that old bastard's funeral.

I returned to the charger and tossed the oatmeal crème pie into Howie’s lap, bringing forth a satisfied giggle as he tore the package open with glee.

Dan was already buckled into his seat, glancing back at Howie with an amused grin. He spied the pie.

“Oatmeal huh?” He said with a curious look and that smirk. “Oatmeal’s healthy.” He decided.

“That’s what I was thinking.” I responded with a half smile. “Mel looks good, says you owe him some money.”

Dan huffed and shrugged. “Man I owe lots of people money, tell his old ass to get in line, maybe he’ll die before he gets to the front, save me some Benjies.” He started up the charger with a rumble, pulling out of the EZ pump they rolled through town, past Main then right on 2nd. Empty shops lined the street, though a few holdouts managed to keep the lights on.

Cravings, my favorite candy shop when we were kids, was borded up, and recently by the looks of it. “Doddy closed Cravings?”

Dan nodded. “Yeah man, Covid was hard, Doddy got through on those loans the government gave out, but after the credit dried up, well, customers just never came back.” He rubbed his stubble, mouth a tight grim line.

Understanding immediately, I sighed and looked out at the ruin of downtown Elgin. People like his brother held a lot of contempt for the government at baseline, and the way the pandemic was handled had not helped to improve the relationship. 

“I heard she opened up an online shop, trying to sell off home made stuff out of her garage, good for her I guess.” Dan gripped the wheel with white knuckles, his frown deepening, but he held back the worst of his thoughts, probably for my sake.

“Uncle Dan!” Howie called from the back.

“Yeah bud?” Dan's face softened.

“The little Debbie was…” Howie paused for a moment to swallow the last of the cookie, faced covered in crumbs. “Good!”

Dan smiled wide, a bright look in his eyes that I could recognize from when we would kick around the woods looking for salamanders. “Yeah?” He said with a chuckle. “I bet it was.”

Smiling, I turned away from their babble, eyes still fixed on the dying town that had been my home once, and now again. There used to be people, that I remembered correctly. Not a lot, nowhere near the number of people wandering Portland's streets on a slow day, let alone during rush hour or weekends, but more than this.

“There aren’t even any homeless people…”

Dan turned at the words. “Yeah, I don’t know man, maybe the boys in blue are cracking down…”

That didn’t sound like them. All experience would indicate that the Elgin sheriffs, despite the towns back the blue zeal, were dedicated to keeping the town sleepy. They had never been known to roust the townies, and with the political climate as tense as it was, I figured the last thing Sheriff Hayes wanted was bad homeless pr.

The car rolled along, rumbling over potholes and uneven pavement until we reached the turn off for our property, a gravel road called Bayer Lane.

The dodge clattered as it chewed its way across the loose stone, the muscle car was never meant for such conditions, but Dan had insisted on taking his car rather than driving dads old pickup. The property was the same as I remembered; an old house sitting on 6 acres of land backing right up into the forest. Only 1 neighbor within earshot, the Bayer’s, Roger and Betty.

We pulled up outside the house. The old double wide had been extended to accommodate a larger family, and that was the only “upgrade” that had ever been done to the place. The paint was long faded, the roof in desperate need of cleaning and maintenance, and the wood patio was rotting away. Home…

“House looks good.” I say with a half smile.

“Chshhh, no it don’t…” Dan sucked his teeth and grinned. “Damn thing is coming apart, no roof leak yet though, so that’s a plus…” he opened his door and stepped out. I popped my door open and joined him, gravel crunching beneath my shoes. A light mist still fell, leaving my face damp as I stared into windows which stared back like dull, listless eyes.

“You gonna keep it?” I asked, more judgingly than I had intended. Dan shrugged and spat, his lips a hard line.

“What else am I supposed to do with it Timmy?” He asked almost bitterly. “You think we could sell it to anyone in town, shit they can’t afford it even if I let it go for half its value, which ain’t much.” He popped the trunk open and started pulling bags out.

“Or hey, maybe one of your big city friends will buy it, you know, make it a little vacation home, come down and visit the plebs, sort of an artists retreat for some metrosexual to bring their buddies too where they can sample local craft microbrews and talk about Descartes or some shit.” He grumbled. I couldn’t help but laugh, rolling my eyes at Dans purposeful hostility.

Dan bit his lip to suppress a grin. “What I say something funny?” He said, laughing when I gave him a dry look.

“For real though, Dad worked his ass off for this place, the least I could do is keep the fire burning.” He said as he pulled free Howie’s Bluey backpack. “Hey why don’t you get lazy pants outa his chair, he can bring his own shit in, earn his keep.”

I nodded and opened the back seat. Howie sat reading a picture book he’d read a dozen times, Noticing by Kobi Yamada.

“Come on, uncle Dan says you gotta earn your keep.” I say with an apologetic smile.

“Do I have to shoe the horses?” Howie asked hopefully.

“The Horse has been shoed, nah I was thinkin you could do some real bottom of the rung labor and help drag these bags in, starting with yours.” Dan held out the backpack. Howie unbuckled and retrieved his bag, squinting at the house.

“It looks haunted.” He said cautiously.

“It is.” Dan answered immediately with a sly grin.

“No it’s not.” I assure Howie, giving him a hug then patting his back. “Go on, your room is the small one with the car bed.” Howie raced inside, pulling open the screen door with a creak.

“Just don’t let the door sl-.” Dan started then stopped when the screen slammed shut with a metallic clang. “Fuck, alright, whatever…” Dan shrugged, gathering bags up and heaving them over to the covered patio. “Any time you wanta help, princess?” He shot at me.

I grabbed the remaining bags and followed, gathering them on the patio. “You staying in dads room?” Dan shook his head no.

“Nah, living room is good enough for me, I got a new armchair that reclines, well anyways we’re planning a spring wedding in Lincoln City.” He laughed, popping open the screen and pulling the bags in. “You sure traveled light, I expected to need to rent a U-Haul to get your shit out here, but I didn’t even need to fill the backseat…” he says with a nod.

I nod knowingly. “I didn’t have much left in Portland…”

Dan stopped and sighed, bags in front of the old sectional. He stood tall with a grunt and looked at me with something approaching sympathy, then looked down, wiping his hands off on his jeans. “Hey man, shits inside, you can unpack it later, how about a beer?”

“Eh I don’t know, Kid’s still up.” I say with uncertainty.

“Fuck man it’s just a beer, I’m not asking you to get trashed.” Dan heads into the kitchen, leaving me to get uncomfortably familiar with my old/new home. It was all the same, from the beat up blue sectional to the Big Mouth Billie Bass wall decoration, all of it screamed of Dad. Dan had kept it neat, and judging from the smell had stopped smoking inside.

“Here you go.” Dan announced his return with a can of Pabst.

I scoff and roll my eyes. “Had I known you were gonna serve me water I wouldn’t have hesitated.” I chuckle, snapping the can open with a splash of foam.

“Oh I forgot, big city folk drink IPA’s that taste like cigarette butts and orange whispers with enough abv to make a frat boy blush…” He chuckles, sipping his own beer.

“They come in other flavors too.” We laugh and step back out onto the patio, the damp smell of the wood better than any luxury scented candle could offer. We stood  and watched fog roll across the property, the Bayers house visible in the distance. The barn sat off to the left of the house, and the whickers of a horse could be heard from inside.

“That still Thunder?” I ask, remembering the horse dad had bought on a whim from the rodeo.

“Yeah man, old bastard won’t die, dad said he’d outlive us all, died young just to prove it…” Dan smiled sadly and sipped his beer, eying the barn fondly. “You know he never once mucked the stable, not even when it was just me and him, lazy bastard.”

I nod, trying my best to remain light hearted. Despite his many, many sins, Dad still held a place of reverence in my brothers heart. “Dad was a delegator.” I say dryly.

“Yeah, hey Danny, get me a beer, hey Timmy, fix the remote, hey Jimmy, stay outa the kitchen..” Dan smirked as he did his impression, our fathers raspy country drawl marred by his deeper baritone.

“Yeah what was up with that, he always thought Jimmy was stealing food…” I ask, remembering the way my dad would watch my best friend with a look of anticipation.

“That’s cuz he was Timmy.” Dan spat, sucking his teeth. “You know how many times I cought the little bastard pilfering our pantry, I tell you what I never seen a kid eat little Debbie’s so fast, well except for yours…” He laughed.

I shrug. “I always just figured he was our guest, welcome to our food you know?”

Dan nodded. “And he was, if dad wanted him to stop he would have kicked his ass out, lord knows he was tempted, given his racial preferences.” He mused darkly.

Raising an eyebrow, I lean forward on the patio fence. “You sayin dad was a racist?” I ask, surprised. I held an appropriate contempt for my father, but had never imagined he had been so reprehensible.

“Nah, I’m saying he was country, he was raised with a certain level of distrust for people who didn’t look like him, but once he got to know James and his family, did I tell you dad used to play cards with the acres, they cleaned him out good too.” Dan smiled warmly, as if the memory itself served to fend off the chill.

“Well, I’m glad he kept his country to himself.” I mumble, then sigh. “Hell no he didn’t.”

“Yeah what?” Dan scoffed, crushing his can and tossing it in a bin just beyond the patio.

“Daddy!”

Turning around, I see Howie standing with my greatest childhood possession.

“You found Reptar!” I say beaming, watching as the boy holds up the green dinosaur.

“That’s a slur…” Dan says, but I ignore him.

“Yeah, he’s cool, old and not really how a t-Rex looks, but still cool.” Howie said, squeezing the old plushie.

“That’s cuz he’s not a T-Rex, more like Godzilla..” I say. Howie twists his face up, confused.

“What’s a Godzilla?”

Dan gives me a serious look. “Well, I know what we are doing this weekend…”

I sigh, pulling the door open with a creak. “I’ll get the dvd’s…”

“Good boy!” Dan shouts.



The sound of Howie's rhythmic snoozing lets me know it’s time to put him down. Scooping the child up, I walk him to my old bedroom, laying him down in the race car bed, pulling the blankets over him. I creep out as stealthily as I can, closing the door with a creak. Sighing, I make my way back out to the living room, where Dan was turning off the dvd player, returning the movies to their boxes with a click.

“Can’t believe the boy fell asleep, it was just getting good.” Dan tutted, gathering the dvd’s into a stack.

“He’s little, he’ll get better at it.” I say apologetically.

Dan nodded. “Remember when you and I used to pull all nighters watching old B horrors?”

“Yeah, nothing better than horror movies broken up by JG Wentworth commercials, nothing breaks the tension quite like 877 cash now…” I chuckle, stepping out to the patio where I knew Dan kept a pack of smokes.

I light up and sigh as the nicotine hits, the dark sky broken up by starlight. Dan joined me, lighting up and cracking open another beer.

“It’s pretty clear out tonight.”

I nod. “Yeah, surprising, thought the rain would keep the stars away…” I look up at the sky and, for the first time since leaving Portland, I can feel myself relax.

“Lucky you, get the full country experience first night back..” Dan said, sipping his beer and taking a long drag. We stood there for a bit, just watching as the night rolled past, a sheet of swirling dark clouds. The distant crunch of tires on gravel notified us to the approaching station wagon.

“Jesus Christ, is that old Beauty?” I ask, recognizing the Acres old Caddy, a 78 Fleetwood, grey as Oregon in summer.

“Gues Jimmy wants to say hi.” Dan mused, sipping his beer with a half grin. “Now it’s a party.”

James Acre, my best friend in the whole world, looked every bit as tired as I felt. The same age as me, his curly dark hair was already chased with silver on the sides, his face, dusted with coarse black hairs, but his eyes were as clear as when they were kids.

“Jimmy, long time?” I call.

Jim’s work shoes disturb the gravel as he makes his approach, closing the car door with a heady thunk. “Long time?” He called back, voice edged. “That really all you gotta say to me?”

I felt my breath catch as I shifted uncomfortably. “I, uh, I’m back now.” I say stupidly, now fully nervous.

Jimmy, face flat and emotionless, stopped just outside of the covered patio. “Yeah, yeah you back, you left without saying goodbye.”

I bit my cheek and cursed, knowing that Jimmy was right to be upset.

“No notes, no texts, not even an invite out to the city, I heard Portland's got good food. Maybe Jimmy would have enjoyed that?” Jimmys face was as serious as sin, his lips set in a hard line, eyes unyielding.

“I, I know man, I just wanted to, to get a clean break you know?” I stammer out, dropping my cigarette with a curse as the ember reaches my fingers.

“Yeah,I get it, a clean break…” Jimmy nodded slowly then smirked. “Alright, Square!” 

I dropped my face into my hands and cursed, Dan, however, couldn’t have been happier.

“Hooo that’s what I’m fucking talking about boys, alright.” He dashed into the house and returned with the cones, the fucking cones, of course he had kept them.

Dan dashed past Jimmy into the yard, setting each cone until they formed a small square vaguely the size of the patio. “Alright boys you know the rules, no rabbit punches, no biting, try to keep your manicures to yourself, and kicking is for Europeans.” He called out, elated.

Jimmy stepped into the square and tossed his coat aside, rolling his shoulders.

“Come on guys this shit ain’t fair!” I say desperately as my legs march me involuntarily toward the square. “I’ve been in uni this whole time, Jimmy is a fucking mechanic!?”

“Not our fault you chose pussy work.” Jimmy said with a bright smile.

“Yeah man, it’s the rules, you wronged Jimmy, so he's allowed a challenge.” Dan said, parroting our father word for word. I curse and take off my jacket, leaving it in the gravel as I step into the square.

Dan smiled like a kid in a candy store. “You boys ready?”

Jimmy nodded, raising his hands in a boxers stance.

“Fuck, yeah ok.” I loosen up, bringing my hands up to guard my face.

“Alright ladies let’s DANCE!” Dan whooped, stepping clear of the square.

James came for me quicker than I would have anticipated, closing the distance he threw a right hook at my head. Luckily for me, it had been his opening move since he was 10. I cought the blow on my arm, gritting my teeth at the pain as I returned fire with my own right, nailing him in the collar bone.

James backed up, then came again. Two quick jabs left my forearms aching enough that, stupidly, I didn’t anticipate a stronger right cross. My chin screamed as Jimmy’s rough knuckled fist nailed a blow, only glancing, but enough to turn my head.

“Come on Timmy, fight back!” Dan cursed, dancing in place.

“Fuck off!” I shot back, trying to press Jimmy, hoping for a ring out. My blows were wild and inaccurate, Dan was the fighter, I only ever did enough to win.

Jimmy caught my arms and pulled me in, locking me by my head and shoulders. I coughed, doubling over, my shirt sliding over my head as Jimmy pulled hard, turning my forward momentum against me. Crashing into the gravel beyond the square, I lay still, panting, battered and scraped.

After what felt like minutes but was probably only a few seconds, I pulled my shirt down and sat up, chin aching, body protesting over half a dozen minor scrapes and bruises. Looking up, I met Jimmy’s gaze with an apologetic look.

“We square?” I ask, trying not to groan. Jimmy’s serious mask split into his normal, dazzling white smile, and he offered me a hand up.

“Yeah man, we’re square.” I took his hand and he lifted me up. “City life got you soft, Tim.” Jimmy said, brushing dirt and small stones from my clothes with a grin.

“Yeah, or I never was really good at this.” I offer, trying my best to save face.

“Well, your home now, we can work on that.” Dan said, clapping me on the back, driving me to wince in pain.

“Not tonight though, tonight we get fucked up, and you catch me up on everything I’ve missed.” Jimmy said, taking me by the shoulder and leading me to the house.

Just like that, all was forgiven, if not necessarily forgotten. It was like before, Dan, Jim, and Tim, the 3 of us together. It was easy, like riding a bike, I never really forgot. As we drank and talked, I couldn’t help but feel more and more like everything might be ok. Heather was gone, and I would never be the same, but maybe, maybe the new me, or was it the old me? Maybe, this me, the me that was back with family, back with friends, back in Elgin, maybe this version of me could find a way to be happy again. Maybe coming home, I could find Timothy Grim, or at least the part of him I had lost.
