Hey, my name's Cletus. And I have lived in a swamp my entire life, along with my lovely vessel Mary. I am a tour guide, of sorts. Me and Mary pick up some tourists, they pay us to go around the swamp to look at landmarks, and that's about it. I don't know why people would spend their hard earned money to see some old decrepit swamp, but hey I'm not judging (I am) I've lived in this swamp my entire life and it's really not that special, y'know besides the nightmarish abominations God abandoned long ago that reside within the swamp. Anyways, I'm bored and currently on my break, and I've recently found a computer. Sure the screen is cracked and it runs like dogshit, but works (most of the time) and i decided to start, a blog of sorts, to tell some of my personal experiences with said beasts of legend. So without further ado, let's begin.

Story #1 The Gator Twins.                                                                                                        Alright, so me and Mary were doing the usual, driving some annoying ass tourist's around the swamp. I was trying my best to ignore the crying and screaming of children in the back as I drove, they probably must've seen #######. I went up to a couple of landmarks, a carnival that I both remember existing before and not existing before, a pit that probably went down to hell, and a family of polar bears feasting on the carcass of a long dead god. Pretty mundane stuff so far, no one's had their soul devoured out of their anus yet. I then began a small history lesson about the swamp, and how it existed long before the big bang, but was rudely interrupted by the sounds of children being brutally murdered and eaten by a two-headed alligator. Everyone was panicking. Don't worry, I'm a trained professional. I know what to do in situations like these. I walked up to the alligator and threw it off of Mary. The tour was pretty much ruined though, as everyone kept crying and screaming. 

Story #2 The Man.                                                                                                                       So, I had good feeling that this was going to be a great day. Then I saw the man, he was covered in mud, blood and other liquids from beyond this reality. Now listen here. You don't fuck with the man. I found that out the hard way. It was not one of my proudest moments, Dr. Richmond-Jones had to turn me outside-in. Manually. Anyways, everyone knew at this point not to fuck with him. So, I thought everything would be fine. That's when I saw a heroin addict come aboard Mary. He was some guy in his early 50's and used one of those walkers with tennis balls on the legs. He got on with couple other people, and I hesitantly began our tour. Not even a minute in, and the heroin addict was already gone. I've delt with heroin addicts before, they always cause some level of trouble, like that one guy who fucked that mold monster. In hindsight I probably shouldn't have let him on, but hey, money's money. So, yeah. The heroin addict confronted the man, probably asking for a hit. When he just got zapped to a realm beyond realms. So, yeah. Later I had to clean up that dude's remains after they fell through a portal. Moral of the story: Don't fuck with the man.                                                                                         

Story #3 The Great red Whale.                                                                                               It was a pretty slow day, not many people came by. I guess after what happened yesterday with the tree goddess, people might be a bit hesitant to go on a swamp tour. But then out of nowhere, three inbred hillbillies came out of the woodwork and asked me to drive them to the location of the great red whale. Apparently they were hunting it. So, I asked for compensation, they then gave my compensation. (I'm surprised they knew what that meant) And as they boarded Mary, they told me their names, the oldest was named "Wilk" the youngest was named "Meat" and the middle child was named "Dal" I can clearly see that their parents put about as much effort in naming them, as they did practicing safe sex. So, the three cousin fuckers got on Mary, and we drove off to hunt the great red whale. When we got to it's hunting grounds, we noticed over one hundred ship wrecks, and got immediately worried for Mary's safety. No way in hell was Mary gonna die for these morons. So, I thought of a solution. I gave the three unloved brothers a small row boat I had stashed onto Mary and told them that I'd be back in a hour. I then left the failed abortions to fend for themselves. About...6 hours later I finally came back. And surprisingly one of the brothers was alive, kinda, his entire lower half was missing, but he was partially alive. Then the whale came back finished the job, so whatever. Now do I feel bad for partially being the reason these "people" died? Nah, not really. They were mean to Mary. Calling her a "boat" she's a fishing vessel, morons. 


And, that's about all I have time for. My boss just called me and said that the village of thorn has recently reappeared after 10 years, and a couple of my boss' fisherman have gone missing. They're probably dead, but my boss is paying quite a lot of moolah to find them, so I'm gonna take Mary out to that village and see what happens. Wish me luck. I might continue this blog, y'know if I'm not dead. See ya!
