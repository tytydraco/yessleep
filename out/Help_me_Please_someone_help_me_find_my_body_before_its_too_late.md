If you are reading this, you are my only hope of reconnecting with my physical self before they pull the plugs on us both - body and spirit. The Doctors have already declared me braindead.

How rude! They could not see my frantic attempts to get back inside my body as they conducted a series of tests before one of the Doctor’s said, “He’s gone.”  Alive, but no longer conscious.

First of all, I am not gone. I was standing right next to the guy when he said it.  

Secondly, I am not dead. My consciousness is very much firing on all cylinders thank you very much. In fact, I have never possessed such a clarity in thoughts as I have since the moment I popped out of my skin. 

I can think and I can feel within this body of vibrating energy. And most importantly, I can communicate with you. At least until they delete me from my connection here or until they take my body off of life support, wherever I am. It’s as if I have two guillotines ready to drop from above and I have little time to squirm out from beneath them.

However, I’m aware of how fantastical my situation is and I fear that if I do not explain the events that led me here, I would be forfeiting any expectations of you believing what happened to me, let alone convince you to help me?

So let me text this clearly and quickly through the MeWie Frequency connected to the only smartphone in the world that my consciousness is synced up with. 

Seven years ago I had a heart attack. Although it was a mini stroke, the car accident that ensued was a major crash. I was left paralyzed with only the ability to blink. My injuries were severe and irreparable. Through some wonderful State funded programs, I was kept alive and well taken care of for many years by truly kind hearted staff. I am grateful to them. It’s a shame they’re about to kill me. 

My parents passed when I was young and I never started a family of my own. I thought there would be more time for that. Eventually, the friends I did have in my life all moved on with theirs. I don’t blame them. So you could say my social life was slim when I used my eyes to blink-agree for a new experimental procedure. After six and a half long years of immobility and isolation, I would have let them shoot me into outer space with a circus cannon. 

I was relocated to Statfeq Medical University where a team of Doctors slapped an EEG cap on my scalp. No chip in the brain, no incisions, no additional tubes. All they did to me was place that small, round cap over my head and then they got to work. They used new AI software and a Brain Machine Interface to link my brain’s neural activity to my new smartphone. The AI system was programmed to tap into my consciousness and decipher my individual life frequency. Apparently we all have one. Our own vibrational rhythm that makes us who we are. 

The Doctors called it the MeWei Frequency and once my mind and AI system melded, I was able to think text on the smartphone. Yes, text! That may sound like nothing to you, but for me, being able to text a back and forth conversation with the staff has been miraculous. 

Everyday these past few months, I would think about what I wanted to say and my thoughts would leave my body and travel along the MeWei Frequency, across the room without any wires and arrive in this little phone that translated my thoughts to texts. So yea, texting is a big deal in my world. It was the last thing I was doing before my soul separated from my body.

I was very tired, consciously floating in that space between being awake and asleep. I remember pushing my thoughts outward, as if some mental wall was blocking my transference of thought. So I pushed my mind with half of my brain in the real world and the other half in this ethereal one - and somehow I rode the frequency right out. Except I was somehow severed from the vibrational cord and completely free, standing there between the hard drives of my body and smartphone. 

I stared at my spirit legs and thought - I can walk! Sure, these legs are like a vibrating mist that hums and somehow moves within itself. But hey, I’m walking here! After a few moments of checking myself out, I finally had the great idea to see if I’m still breathing here on the bed. Sure enough, not only was I breathing, but I seemed peaceful. I shouldn’t have observed my physical self as long as I did. It’s been a long time since I checked myself out in a mirror and the me lying before my spirit me is a stranger. 

So I walked out of the room on my spirit legs. Right through the door into the busy hallway where no one could see or touch me as I am.  And let me tell you something - boy can I move fast without my body-anchor holding me down. I mean I was running right through people so fast that at one point I looked down and saw that my spirit feet weren’t touching the floor anymore. It was cool at the time. I felt a wave of gratitude. I wasn’t scared yet because I had escaped isolation! Conquered immobility! Just as my thoughts had become clearer, my emotions too had become unfiltered and I experienced a euphoria that I couldn’t have imagined possible. 

And then came the pain. Every single inch of my spiritual self suddenly felt stabbed all at once. It subsided for only a moment and then kept returning in terrible waves. I tried to hurry back to my body but I had been careless and struggled to remember where my room was. 

By the time I found it and entered through the nearest wall, there was already a team of nurses and Doctors hovering around my physical self. The hum of my flatline sang loudly from the machine behind me as my soul twisted with suffering. 

Apparently, I just had my second heart attack. I don’t know if my out-of-body stroll caused it, or if their technology did, but I moved toward my body and tried to get back in. Over and over again I passed through my body without merging. I really started to panic when they broke out the big guns and placed a defibrillator on my chest. They were counting down so I instinctively ran toward my head and dove just as the defibrillator sent a powerful electric shock throughout my body.

Buzzing. A low humming light. That’s all I could feel and understand. There was no more pain. Just bright disorientation. After some time, I rematerialized enough to stand again. But I couldn’t move while I watched them conduct their tests and declare me brain dead. By the time I regained my complete sense of consciousness and could move again, they had already taken my body elsewhere.  

Wondering what to do, two nurses came in and started cleaning up. I was standing between them while they talked about my condition. First I heard the one nurse discuss my physical fate, and then the other one said that someone with MeWei is coming to delete my smartphone. Their plan is to reconnect it to another paralytic patient down the hall. They finished talking and left. 

I followed them of course. I was hoping they would lead me to my body. They didn’t. So I went searching myself.  What felt like endless time passed and I failed to locate my body. You’d think there’d be a built in GPS or something where I can just tap Home and zip right to me. But I can’t feel any connection to my body. So I came back to this room and found my only glimpse of hope.

My smartphone had a long text on it that read - PLEASE STOP. I’M STILL ALIVE. DON’T KILL ME. PLEASE HELP ME. OH GOD. - and a few more sentences similar to that. I realized right away that those were my thoughts from when the nurses were chatting. Somehow my thoughts are still able to connect with the phone. 

So I am ready to think-text whoever the person is that comes to delete me from their system. I hope they read my texts before doing anything hastily. 

While I wait, I beg you to come to the facility and demand to speak on my behalf. Tell them I am not dead. Tell them you want my body returned to my room so that they can figure out how to put me back together again, body and soul. Please, now that you understand, will you help me? I have no other means to reach help other than this link I found to the outside world. I fear that it won’t be long be-

Wait! Someone is here! A man in a suit. He picked the smartphone up and is typing on the main machine. This is my chance. 

STOP! I AM STILL ALIVE. SIR, DO NOT DELETE MY CONNECTION. STOP. STOP. STOP. I AM STILL ALI-
