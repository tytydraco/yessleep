I moved out of my parent’s house a year ago when I turned sixteen, but I’d always come back for visits on birthdays and to spend the holidays with family.

I remember that night in such great detail, it was my younger brother’s birthday and I was headed back to my parent’s house to spend his birthday with them. 

On my drive there, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Well apart from one thing.

My mother was always the overprotective type, she would constantly text me and call me to make sure I was okay, but on that day she did no such thing. I remember thinking that it was a little odd she hadn’t called or said anything but I brushed it off, telling myself she was probably just too focused on my younger brothers to worry about it.

As I stepped out of the car and walked down the drive, I remember how uncomfortably quiet the house was. The usual sounds of Oli and Alex bickering amongst themselves were nowhere to be found, the sounds of my parent’s joyous laughter echoing from the sitting room as they watched some crappy comedy show were gone. 

I hesitantly pushed open the door and was greeted by the most horrific smell I will ever have the misfortune of smelling, I nearly threw up as I quickly pulled the door closed and coughed.

I took a minute before finally gathering up the courage to push open the door and find what that smell was coming from, I quickly covered my nose, pushing open the door for a second time and stepping into the house.

As I turned the corner and peered into the living room my stomach churned at the sight before me and I couldn’t believe my eyes. What I saw in that room is a sight that will haunt me for the rest of my life, the four of them laying in a pool of their own blood, I was too shocked to do anything but stare.

That smell, it couldn’t have been coming from these bodies yet. They were too fresh, and that realisation drew me back into reality as I quickly began to search for the source of the smell. I went from room to room before I finally pushed open the basement door, and there at the bottom steps I saw it, the decaying body of a cow.

There was something strange about that cow, in fact there were several things that immediately stuck out to me, the cow had three curled horns like those of a goat, two protruded from the sides of the animals head, but the third one protruded from the creature’s nose in a similar fashion to that of rhinoceros.

The animal’s eyes were wrong, I don’t know how to describe it but something about that thing’s eyes appeared almost human.

The animal’s chest had been pried open and the organs were all pulled out, a pool of dried blood surrounding the carcass.

I closed the basement door and made my way out of the house, I still wasn’t sure what to make of it all as I pulled out my phone and dialled 911, I don’t remember much of what happened afterwards.

The police came and an ambulance came to collect the bodies, the police questioned me and took a look around the house, at which point I showed them the decaying carcass polluting the basement with the smell of decaying flesh, both of the officers agreed that there was something very wrong with that cow, but the body was thankfully removed from the house along with the bodies of my family.

The officers gave me their condolences, and with that they left the scene. I stayed outside on the front porch for what felt like forever, before I headed to my car and made my way back to my house.

I didn’t know what to feel as I got home and headed inside, my hands trembling, I collapsed on the couch and lay in silence for what felt like forever.

I don’t remember falling asleep, but I awoke the next morning to the sound of a knocking at the door, I walked over the door, straightening my clothes and running my fingers through my hair trying to make myself as presentable as possible all things considered.

I opened the door, but there was no one there, I looked around in confusion. Just as I was about to close the door, my eyes landed on a box at my feet.

I picked up the box, it was surprisingly heavy for its size, and I shut the door with my foot as I carried the box through to the kitchen, I grabbed a knife and cut the tape sealing the box.

I peered inside the box, unsure what to expect. I stared in confusion for several minutes at the contents of the box. There was a letter and a small package wrapped entirely in black tape. I picked up the letter first and examined it carefully in my hands.

I immediately noticed that the return address was my own address.

I tore open the letter carefully and several polaroids fell out, followed by a sheet of paper folded carefully.

I picked up the polaroids and froze, each polaroid showed a different member of my family, and the final one, the most horrific of them all showed them all in their final moments, blades to their wrists with their eyes staring straight ahead as if in some kind of trance.

I stared in horror “w-what the fuck” I finally blurted out, dropping the polaroids down on the table. I didn’t want to know what else was in that box, but curiosity got the better of me, I picked up the sheet of paper and carefully unfolded it. The paper was blank, all except for the letter "T." I didn't know what that meant, but I didn't really care.  
  
I found myself reaching into the box and taking out the last item I'd yet to open, a horrible yet all too familiar smell filled my nostrils and to my disgust, whatever was wrapped in this tape was squishy.

I picked up the same knife and carefully cut open the tape, as I did a foul brown liquid seeped out into my hands, I peeled off the layers of tape only to find a heart in my hands, I screamed and dropped the organ on the ground as I began to retch uncontrollably.

What kind of sick fucking joke is this? I thought as I stared at the contents of the box in disgust. When the police arrived, they weren’t sure what to make of it all, but they took the contents of the box away as evidence, and we were starting to think that my family may not have died by their own hands.

I will update everyone as soon as I can. I don’t know how long it will be before I’m able to update everyone, this is a hard time for me, but I know there’s more to this story.
