No, I do not mean dark energy as in spooky energy or eldritch energy or any other sci-fi mumbo jumbo bull-crap out there.

Dark energy is theorized to be the largest form of energy that exists in this universe. It makes up roughly 68% of the total energy here, in this universe, as of now. It is so powerful that it causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate.

That's right. The universe does not expand at a constant rate! How cool is that?

Well, I must be careful. I am a scientist, so we always have to take everything with some degree of uncertainty, and the topic of dark energy is no different. Especially since the evidence for dark energy that we currently have are indirect observations from the cosmos.

Now, before I tell you about the snag that I encountered, I must inform you that everything coming out of my mouth is confidential. You must swear to your God or various Gods that you will never tell a soul about it. Otherwise, well, you know.

On top of that, my supervisor has forbidden me from disclosing any technical details about the experiment. Only the aftermath of the problem. So, I will only be referring to this experiment as Operation Dark Radar.

With that out of the way, I can describe to you at a high-level what Operation Dark Radar is all about.

Operation Dark Radar is, well was, our ambitious attempt to directly detect and measure dark energy. We have developed a sophisticated array of instruments designed to capture the faintest signals that might indicate the presence of dark energy. Our goal is to understand its properties and behavior, and ultimately, to unlock its secrets.

In short, we have two questions that we want answered: What the hell is dark energy? And why does it exist?

The superiors, on the other hand, want another question answered: How can we harness and use dark energy?

This should be sufficient for you to understand what Operation Dark Radar is all about. Now, I will describe to you the lab. Again, at a high level.

The facility is huge and located 2.3 kilometers underground. This serves several purposes.

The first one is to shield our instruments from external radiation emitted from human-made sources. For example, we want to limit radio waves, microwaves, x-rays, gamma rays, and other forms of radiation produced in cities from affecting our instruments.

Secondly, we don’t want the public to find out. None of that pseudo-scientific journalism sensationalizing this important research. We also don’t want foreign or domestic actors stealing or interfering with our research.

And last, but certainly my favorite, we need to monitor the equipment 24/7. That’s right. We get to live here! Like mole people! I know many people here hate that, but I love it.

The day-to-day? What’s that like? Hmmm.

The equipment needs to be checked every 30 minutes as even a temperature change of a single degree Celsius will ruin everything and cause a 24-hour downtime just to get everything back to optimum levels. And the temperatures we are reaching are near-zero, close to 10 degrees Kelvin or -263.15 degrees Celsius.

So myself, Kristoff, Hamil, Erica, Sabrina, and Arnold rotate between shifts to monitor the system. Kristoff and I monitor the morning shift, between 00:00 and 08:00. Hamil and Erica monitor the system between 08:00 and 16:00. And Sabrina and Arnold monitor the system between 16:00 and 00:00.

Monitoring procedures are pretty standard, you know. Check temperature. Check electronics. Check that controlled measurements match calibration.

After that, we can finally check the equipment to see if it has picked up any anomalies. For us to be sure that the measurements are meaningful, we need to ensure that the confidential metric is six standard deviations away from the baseline. My apologies, I see that you are anxious and want to know more about it, but I am afraid that this technical detail is on a need-to-know basis.

Every so often, our equipment picks up massive events in the universe. Do you recall the massive gamma-ray burst that hit Earth on October 9, 2022? It was one of the brightest events of all time, if not the brightest. And no, it wasn’t because of the gamma rays—they cannot penetrate 2.3 kilometers into the Earth. The collapse of the star that caused that massive burst also emitted both neutrinos and gravitational waves, which Dark Radar can detect. Unfortunately, due to the sensitivity of our equipment, everything got destabilized. It took us at least a week to return everything back to normal.

This is as far as I am willing to go in terms of day-to-day details. Both of our lives are on the line in terms of what information we exchange here today. But to be honest, only yours is truly at risk. 

Let’s move on to the problem we encountered a week ago, March 16, 2025.

Kristoff and I were in charge of monitoring the tools in the morning. Precisely at 03:18, our equipment detected an extremely powerful anomaly. We were afraid of our equipment destabilizing, so we put the lab on high alert and woke everyone up.

Erica and Arnold checked the internet using a secured computer with several layers of security. They found nothing from the public that could explain our equipment issues.

Sabrina and Hamil ran diagnostic scans on the equipment to ensure that everything was stable. Sure enough, the equipment’s temperature was stable, and the controlled measurements did not deviate from the calibration.

Kristoff was manning the classified metric monitoring while I was checking the radar component to determine approximately where the anomaly occurred.

After the initial radar scan, I had to check again. I found that the anomaly occurred inside the lab. After running this scan maybe five, six times, it was all consistent—it was right here in this lab. Looking at the screen, it appeared very small. Kristoff checked the metrics and found that this thing, whatever it was, was emitting power at roughly the same amount as the collapse of a star that emitted that massive gamma-ray burst back on October 9, 2022.

This was when we called headquarters, notifying them of our findings. They decided to send a huge detachment of security and technicians to help protect the equipment. Within 15 minutes, a detachment of 20 soldiers arrived, along with 17 technicians.

Within one hour of receiving the detachment, there was an incident with one of the security teams. At the northwest corner of the lab, we heard loud screams. And it wasn’t just the typical screams of fear you hear in the movies. It was horrible. They sounded as if they were in a tremendous amount of pain. On top of that, we also heard the sounds of bones snapping and cracking. The strangest part was that the screams would gradually rise to a higher pitch, then, silence.

We, as in the research team—all six of us including myself—could hear the security leader use the radio to inquire a report from team Epsilon. We only heard silence as a response. This was when he ordered an evacuation of the facility. I could see why the leader was promoted to his position. I think his name was Andrew.

Stubborn me demanded that this facility be secured. That he needed to send his soldiers to investigate. Andrew replied to my demand, stating that further casualties must be avoided, and that at least the equipment can be replaced but good people cannot.

Thinking about it now, I was a fool, but a lucky fool. He was gathering everyone to go up the huge service elevator to make it to a safe place, in the security headquarters near the surface. However, I decided to grab the handgun on the corner of the monitoring table while no one was looking, and I snuck away from the group.

My goal? Well, I guess at the time it was to look for this thing, kill it, and secure my lab. Like I said, I was a fool.

But lucky though. Sadly, five minutes after sneaking off, I could see everyone on the elevator going up. However, I saw this black thing forming at the ceiling of the elevator just above Andrew’s head. Black is not the right word; while I was looking at this thing form, it looked like it was sucking all color around it. So, I think the correct thing to say is the lack of color rather than black, as that’s what it looked like to me.

That’s when I could see everyone in the elevator appear to slowly get sucked into this thing. The best way to describe this is the effects of an object going into a black hole. As they were drawn closer, their bodies began to stretch and elongate, a process known as spaghettification, caused by the intense tidal forces. Limbs and torsos extended grotesquely, their forms becoming thin and distorted as if they were being pulled apart like strands of spaghetti.

They crossed what seemed like an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing can escape. The light around them started to shift to a deep red, a gravitational redshift, making them appear dimmer and more distant. Their screams appear to fade while their pitch appears to increase, swallowed by the darkness. As they were sucked into this black hole-like phenomenon, time itself seemed to slow down for them, a phenomenon known as time dilation, until they appeared to freeze in place.

Finally, they were pulled towards the center, where the gravitational forces were infinitely strong, crushing them into an infinitely small point, much like the singularity at the heart of a black hole. Their bodies compressed into a singularity, an unfathomable point of infinite density, where the known laws of physics ceased to exist. 

I won’t go further into the gory details. After viewing this horrible thing for roughly five minutes, I decided to turn around and hide. I dropped the gun and hid under my desk, trying to use my chair to conceal my body.

It must have felt like an hour or so of sheer silence after the entire team’s death. I was contemplating what to do next. That’s when I saw the table in front of me slowly start to lose color. The vibrant hues drained away, leaving behind a dull, lifeless gray. Then I saw this thing, made out of a lack of color, walk through it, towards me. It was as if the very essence of color was being consumed by its presence, creating a void that seemed to absorb all light and life around it.

It looked human, but there was something profoundly unsettling about its appearance. Its entire body was made out of a lack of color. It had arms and legs, but they were smooth and featureless, devoid of any distinguishing marks or textures. There were no fingers or toes, just blunt, rounded ends where they should have been. Its head was equally featureless—no hair, no eyes, no ears, no mouth, nothing. It was as if someone had sculpted a human form out of pure darkness, erasing all traces of individuality and expression.

As it moved closer, the air around it seemed to grow colder. It stopped a few meters in front of me. Then it pointed towards me with one of its featureless limbs. I wanted to run, but instead, I left my hiding place and stood still. I knew there was no way to escape this thing. All I could do was wait and accept my fate.

I started to receive visions in my head. It appeared as if it was showing me a civilization made of the void. It was a realm of emptiness, where light and color were swallowed by an all-encompassing darkness. The beings that inhabited this place were shadows, entities formed from the very essence of the void. They were not humanoid; their shapes were fluid and ever-changing, shifting between forms that defied comprehension. They moved with an eerie grace, reminiscent of laminar flow or water flow without turbulence.

It walked around the lab, inspecting the equipment. Well, walk is not the correct word—more like moved or flowed. Its movements were fluid and seamless, as if it were gliding through the air. That’s when it sent me another set of visions.

In these visions, I saw how our equipment had somehow managed to make a connection between Earth and the void world. It was as if a beacon of light had pierced through the impenetrable darkness, creating a bridge between our reality and theirs. The instruments, designed to detect the faintest signals of dark energy, had inadvertently tapped into the fabric of the void, opening a gateway to this shadowy realm.

This thing, this entity made of the void, was an emissary of sorts. It had crossed over through the connection we had established, drawn to the light that had penetrated its world. It moved with purpose, inspecting the equipment and the staff that had facilitated its arrival. 

Then, the next set of visions flooded my mind. I saw the fate of my colleagues, their demise a result of their unworthiness. The emissary had judged them, finding them lacking in the qualities necessary to continue the experiment and strengthen the connection between our worlds. Their screams and suffering were a testament to their failure to meet the standards of the void.

In stark contrast, I saw myself in these visions, singled out as the only one worthy of continuing this experiment. The emissary conveyed a sense of purpose and expectation, indicating that I possessed the qualities needed to bridge the gap between Earth and the void. It was a heavy burden, but also a strange honor. I was chosen to strengthen the connection, to delve deeper into the mysteries of dark energy and the shadowy realm it inhabited.

As the visions faded, the emissary's presence loomed over me. I knew right then and there what needs to be done. I didn’t care about my survival at that point, only to continue where I left off. I bowed to it as gesture of good will, indicating to it that I agree to its request.

However, it seemed like it wanted further assurance from me. It wanted to show me the price of failure. 

Suddenly, I felt an overwhelming force pulling me towards the entity. The room around me distorted, and I was drawn into a vortex of darkness. I experienced the black hole phenomenon firsthand. My body began to stretch and elongate, the intense tidal forces causing a sensation of being pulled apart. The pain was excruciating, unlike anything I had ever felt.

As I was drawn closer, I crossed what seemed like an event horizon. The light around me shifted to a deep red, and my screams were swallowed by the void. Time itself seemed to slow down, each moment stretching into an eternity of agony. I felt myself being compressed, crushed towards an infinitely small point, the singularity at the heart of this dark realm.

As I felt myself being compressed towards the singularity, the pain and terror reached an unbearable peak. Just when I thought I could endure no more, the process began to reverse. The crushing force started to relent, and I felt my body slowly decompressing. The intense tidal forces that had stretched and elongated me began to ease, allowing my form to return to its normal shape.

The darkness that had enveloped me started to recede, and the deep red light shifted back to its original hue. Time, which had seemed to stretch into an eternity, began to flow normally again. My screams, swallowed by the void, faded into silence as the vortex of darkness released its grip on me.

I found myself standing in the lab once more, right in front of it, just as before. The room around me returned to its familiar state, the equipment and surroundings no longer distorted by the black hole phenomenon.

It didn’t need to do that. I was already a scientist, driven by discovery, not by greed. But this nightmare it showed me made me realize how powerful this thing was. It was able to suck me into a black hole, never to be seen again, in the most painful way possible. And it was able to somehow reverse that process, perhaps reverse time itself. It was truly horrifying. And fascinating.

But throughout this entire process, I respected it. Not just feared it.

After that, it disappeared.

But it did not leave. Oh no. It is now one with this world.

This left me with one thing: to finish what I started.

Thinking about this now, I realized that there were so many people holding me back. My research team had a secret agenda that they tried to hide from me, driven by greed. The higher-ups, too, kept me back, reducing my funding and only limiting me in areas where profit could be made.

This is not science. This is some sick, twisted perversion of it. This cannot stand.

Oh right. I digressed.

By the way, have you noticed how personnel have suddenly disappeared? Including the higher-ups and executives?

Well, you know who to thank.

Now that you’ve heard this story, I need you to take care of this company. You see, I do not have time for this, and I need someone to do it. Someone to oversee the equipment procurement and staff replacement.

You have been chosen.

Are you up to it?

If you are, great! Welcome aboard!

If not, too bad.

You don’t believe me? Well, turn around.
