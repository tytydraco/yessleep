I (28F) am a freelance artist, and while I love my profession, it requires me to take up side hustles to stay afloat. I've walked dogs, led pilates sessions, delivered food, and written essays, but my favorite part-time job used to be teaching art. I've always had a talent for photorealism which I'd never fully explored due to low demand and high production costs. Luckily, there are just enough people in my area interested in the style for my local art gallery to host a class. They pay me decently to teach two sessions a week, Monday and Thursday nights.



Five months ago, a woman named Daisy joined the class, and I was instantly taken with her for two reasons. The first was that she was around my age while the vast majority of my students were senior citizens. The second was that I thought she resembled her namesake; she had blonde hair and always wore a white coat that reminded me of petals. I remember wanting to be her friend, but also having a hard time reading her. She was extremely attentive, sometimes to the point of being unnerving. Whereas most of my pupils were elderly women who spent the whole class chatting with each other, Daisy sat front and center and stared at me every week, all class long. I was grateful that someone was actually watching my demonstrations, but the weight of her attention was so heavy that it sometimes felt like someone stepping on my chest. 



Another odd thing about Daisy was that while she was an excellent student, she had no interest in the weekly props. She followed my technical advice to a T, but she never drew or painted the flowers, wax fruit, or household items that I had chosen for each session. Instead, Daisy only ever painted men. Though a little odd, I didn't really mind—it wasn't as if the class had grades, and I was a big fan of portraiture myself. Daisy's first finished piece featured the bust of a man with olive skin, wavy brown hair, and brown eyes. It was pretty damn bad, which was great news for me, because it meant I actually had practical advice to offer her. 



A few weeks before I met Daisy, I noticed a new employee at the corner store near my apartment. My city is quite large, but I know my part of it well, so I suspected that the employee had recently moved here. Since it wasn't busy inside the store, I had a brief chat with him while I checked out. He was indeed a recent transplant, and he seemed shy but also very sweet. He never formally introduced himself, but his nametag read "Anthony." 



I would continue to see Anthony every week, sometimes even more frequently. Though our conversations were brief, I really liked the small pieces of himself that he revealed to me, and he was quite handsome as well. After about a month, I asked Anthony to grab dinner with me after his shift, and though tentative, he accepted. 



The evening was a success—we hit it off, Anthony lowered his guard a bit, and though I wasn't exactly sure if he shared the same romantic feelings that I did, I realized I would also be happy to have him as a friend. Although I liked him a lot, Anthony must've been the most private person I'd ever met. By the end of the date, I didn't know his last name, where he lived, or even his phone number. We did, however, set up another meeting for the following week, and I knew where to find him anyway. 



As the weeks passed, I found myself growing closer with both newcomers. Daisy was improving fast, and her portraits were starting to resemble actual humans more so than anime characters. After two months or so, her paintings were detailed enough that I realized something: Daisy wasn't just painting men, she was painting one specific man, over and over and over. When I realized this, I caught her after class one day and asked who the man was, figuring it was a character or celebrity.  



At first, she laughed, saying something like "I was wondering when you'd ask!", but her expression soon turned sombre, and she gave me an explanation that I hadn't been expecting. Apparently, Daisy was painting her late husband, Luca. The two had married young, but as Daisy explained, she had known him all her life, so it seemed like the natural thing to do. She said that he'd left her years ago, but she didn't mention the cause of death. 



"He hated photos," she said. "He hardly ever let me take any. I think back on the years after I lost him, and I feel like there are all of these holes. All of these gaps in my memory where he should have been. When I paint him, I'm repairing those moments. I'm putting him where he should have been."     



Moved by her story, I assured her that I would do everything I could to help her develop as an artist. I couldn't imagine being a widow at our age. Wanting to support her however I could, I offered that she stay after class if she ever needed to talk or wanted to use the classroom supplies. She was grateful. 



As the days got colder and shorter, I spent more and more time with Anthony. I learned a lot about his interests and views, and every new detail made me like him even more. He seemed to like me as well, but he remained emotionally distant. For some reason, I got the sense that he distrusted me, which was strange given that I'd been so open with him. 



While I got closer with Anthony, I also spent more time with Daisy, who would often stay late at the gallery to paint. She was undoubtedly my best student. Her paintings were quickly getting more realistic and complex. She painted candid, domestic scenes of her late husband—Luca taking a nap on the couch, Luca walking down the sidewalk with a coffee in his hand, Luca examining a painting in an art gallery. I asked why she didn't paint herself into any of her works, and she explained that the scenes were meant to be Luca through her eyes. She was in every painting, but as the viewer, not as a subject. 



I loved her paintings. She had a real talent for composition, and I was pleased by how she utilized my advice on color and shape. However, the more pieces Daisy completed, the more familiar her muse became to me. I'm not sure how it took me so long to notice, but after several months of teaching Daisy, I realized how much Anthony resembled Luca. Anthony, though handsome, is a pretty typical looking Italian-American guy. I'm not calling him average or uninteresting to look at, it's just that he doesn't have very unique facial features. As a result, I didn't even realize the similarities until Daisy was skilled enough to consistently incorporate tiny details into her paintings of Luca. 



The thing that tipped me off was a portrait of Luca laughing, in which I could clearly see his slightly crooked bottom teeth. I had noticed the exact same feature when Anthony laughed. I mentioned this to Daisy, saying that her muse bore an uncanny resemblance to a friend of mine. I expected her to find this mildly interesting and then move on, but instead, she stiffened. She asked me something so strange that I remember her exact words: 



"Does your friend have a hole in his head?" 



Taken aback, I shook my head. 



"That's how he died, you know. Shot between the eyes like a dog." After that morbid comment, Daisy asked me a few questions about my friend, such as where we'd met. After the impromptu questioning, she seemed to calm down a bit. Before she left for the night, she took a hold of my hand and stared right into my soul with those intense, lucid eyes of hers. 



"I like you. You've been good to me," she said. "Please take care of yourself, alright?" 



I didn't know how to respond to that. Daisy left shortly after, but our conversation haunted me for the next several days. There was something strange about Anthony, stranger than a man who simply took his privacy seriously. The fact that I still didn't know his last name after months of seeing him was just bizarre, and after my talk with Daisy, my imagination started spinning up all kinds of conspiracy theories. What if Anthony *was* Luca? What if he'd faked his death? But what reason could he have to do so? Maybe he ran away to be with a mistress, but if that were the case then why was he seeing me? I couldn't help but fixate on the situation, and it must have driven me to paranoia; after that conversation with Daisy, when I was in public, I sometimes got the sense that I was being watched. 



It was irrational, deep down I knew, but about a month ago, I stood Anthony up. If he had given me any way to contact him, I would've given him the courtesy of letting him know, but seeing as he clearly didn't trust me, I wasn't able to afford him that luxury. I also temporarily started going to another store for my groceries. I wasn't about to ghost him forever—I just needed a week or two to get my thoughts in order and figure out how to confront him about his secrecy. 



It was during this break that Daisy completed her best piece. The composition and tone were very different from her usual work; instead of a bright, happy scene, she had painted Luca in the middle of a dark, cluttered bedroom. She'd placed him right in the center of the canvas, standing up straight and looking directly at the viewer. She had perfectly captured this eerie mix of fear and surprise on his face. It was honestly an unnerving piece, but it was also really damn good. I had no clue what it was supposed to represent or why she'd drawn her beloved husband in such a way, but I somehow felt that it would be inappropriate to ask, especially if she hadn't meant for the painting to be creepy. 



On the day she finished the piece, Daisy gave me a hug and thanked me for all I'd done for her. I didn't think I'd really done anything, but she said I'd helped her "feel whole again", and I was glad to have done so. Before she left, I told her I was looking forward to her next painting, but after the completion of her *magnus opus*, Daisy stopped coming to class. At first I thought it was a fluke, but it soon became clear that for whatever reason, she would not be returning. I didn't realize how much I'd grown to enjoy her company until I'd lost it. When I looked out at my students and I couldn't find those blonde curls and that pristine white coat, I felt like there was a little hole in my heart. I wondered why she'd left me so abruptly, and if, God forbid, it had anything to do with my other mysterious friend. 



Two weeks ago, I sat alone in the gallery classroom on a rainy night. For the first time in a while, I was working on a painting of my own—a portrait of Daisy. I drew it from my perspective at the front of the room, looking out across the desks. My star student was front and center, staring at me as she always did with her big eyes and slight smile. I must've been doing something wrong, because something in the expression I painted was off. I had inadvertently made her look sinister, like she was plotting my demise more so than she was appreciating my demonstration. I decided to take a break, sitting back from the canvas to figure out where I'd messed up, when I noticed someone standing in the doorway to the classroom. I jumped to my feet in surprise when I recognized the figure. 



Luca—I mean, Anthony, was watching me quietly from the hall. I hadn't seen him in weeks, and I had never told him where I worked. When he saw me stand, he took a few steps into the room. 



"Please just give me a chance to explain. I only came here to talk," he assured me, but his words did nothing to lessen my panic. There was no one else in the building; I was all alone with a man who I had begun to suspect had something to do with Daisy's disappearance. As he talked, he slowly made his way closer, cornering me.



"I haven't been honest with you," he said. "There's a reason I had to move here, the same reason I had to protect my identity. I didn't want to lie to you, I swear, but I didn't want to scare you or put you in danger. If I told you the truth right away, something … bad could've happened to you." 



In the context of the moment, that sure sounded like a threat. I backed up, curious but still alarmed. "Your name's not really Anthony, is it?" 



He opened his mouth to respond, but just then, his eyes fell on my half-finished painting. After studying it in silence for a few seconds, he gasped. When he looked up at me, his expression was that of a man betrayed. There was a mix of shock and fear in his eyes that I'd seen before. 



"Oh my God …" he whispered, and then, with no explanation, he turned around and hurried out of the room. 



That was the last time I ever spoke to him. I had no means of contacting him, and though I kept my eyes peeled for his face every time I went into public, he seemed to have disappeared entirely. I had been certain I'd never see him again until last night, when I saw a recent local news article with a very familiar face beneath the headline: *Man found shot to death in his bedroom.*
