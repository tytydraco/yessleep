One afternoon at work, my phone buzzed. It was unusual for Chloe to call during her classes, so I quickly picked up.  

“Hello?”  

Silence. Then, a faint rustling sound, like fabric brushing against the phone, followed by a sharp click.  

"Chloe?" I asked.  

No response. I called back, but it went straight to voicemail. Something felt wrong. I texted her: "Hey, just got a call from you. Everything okay?"  

Minutes turned into hours with no reply. She never ignored my messages. My discomfort grew with every passing minute.  

As the workday neared its end, I couldn't focus anymore. I told my boss there was an emergency and rushed out. As I pulled into our apartment complex, my heart sank at the sight of Chloe's bag on the ground, its contents strewn everywhere.  

Panic surged through me as I slammed the car door and rushed over. I screamed her name, hoping she was nearby. All down the sidewalk was her makeup, wallet, keys, and phone. With trembling hands, I quickly dialed 9-1-1. 

My voice was shaking as I explained the situation. The dispatcher, in a dismissive tone, asked if she might be with family or friends, seemingly unconvinced. I felt like crying. My whole world has been stolen from me and my only lifeline is being less than useless. After several minutes of arguing and clarification, she finally let me know a car was on the way before I hung up on her mid-sentence.   

With tears now running down my face I slowly collected her belongings and put them back into her bag. Every item gave me visions of her. The concealer she put on in the morning, the hairbrush she always used in the car. The lavender essential oil she put on her pillow.

I sat on the grass in a stupor for I don’t know how long before I looked up to see two cops wander over to me.  

I explained everything. The shop, the cult, the symbols for which I still had an open police report.  

“Is this some kind of joke?” one asked.  

“No.” I said as I looked up at him confused. “Why would this be a joke? She's missing! She's probably scared right now! Why won’t you do anything?”   

“Look...” one of them sighed, “we get calls like this a lot. She's not a minor, and she hasn’t been gone that long. She might just be staying with a friend. If she doesn't show up in the next few days, give us a call and we’ll take a look. Until then, just sit tight.”  

I didn’t respond, I just stared at the blades of grass, even as they got back in their car and drove off. I was completely and totally broken. These freaks clearly wanted us dead for mocking them, and they had the numbers to make that happen.  

I pulled out my phone and looked at the post with the photos Chloe had taken of the ritual. Desperate for someone to take this seriously, I started recording a video. With puffy red eyes and a shaky voice, I let it all out. I don’t remember everything I said or the order I said it in, but by the end, the video was seventeen minutes and thirty-six seconds long. I hit reply and sat on the grass until nightfall.  

I moved through the next day like a ghost. I didn’t even bother calling out sick to work. That afternoon, I heard a knock on the door, expecting it to be my landlord bitching about our trash cans again. I opened it to find a different face greeting me, one I never wanted to see for the rest of my life.

Two massive hands slammed into my chest, sending me tumbling over a barstool. A large man with a shaved head, wearing a wifebeater and gold chain, walked in.

Tim, more commonly known as little Timmy, was anything but. Last time I heard of him, he was stealing cars from dealerships and using them to run guns down to Mexico. Given that he was now in my apartment, I’m guessing most of the felonies he was charged with didn’t stick.

“Where the hell is my sister, little man?” He said as he loomed over me.

“I don’t know, someone took her.” I said with a cough. “How did you even find out?”

“Well, no thanks to you, asshole. Not even a call to her family?” He punched me in the gut.

I was in a lot of pain, but I had to admit he was right. I should’ve told them, but I think I was in too much of a stupor to even think straight.

“You were supposed to be keeping her safe.” He said as he kneeled down and grabbed me by the collar.

“I knew you were always a sniveling little shit, but she gets got and I have to find out like this?” he said as he held up his phone with the video of me crying on the grass yesterday.

I was confused. “How did you see that?”

“She's my sister, dumbass, how do you think? Shits blowing up right now. Do you not check your phone?” He spat as he walked over me, further into the apartment.

I snatched my phone off the counter. Notifications flooded the screen in a blur. I clicked one to see my post was now at twenty seven thousand likes with nearly five thousand retweets. It had gone viral.

“I got a meeting with my parole officer down south in three days,” Tim started. “but I’m not leaving until I know she's safe. So either we find her, or I’m going back to jail, and that shits gonna be on you little man. You don’t want to know what happened to the last guy that got me locked up.”

“Right, um… okay.” I stuttered.

I scrolled through the replies. There was everything from reaction gifs to condolences to people accusing me of killing her, but one in particular caught my eye.

*Hey George, I’m Kelly with GSNN. Would you be available to meet for an interview?*

I stopped for a moment. Everything was happening so fast. I went from feeling helpless to feeling like the whole world was on my side. At that moment, I knew I had to man up. I was going to save her.

“Tim, there's a woman at the shop that knows more than is letting on.Can you talk to her? A journalist wants to meet and I’m going to try to see her tonight.”

Tim walked over. I flinched as he put a hand on my shoulder. “Sure, kid. I’ll go ‘talk’ to her. Just give me the address.”

I replied to Kelly, arranging to meet at a café near the station at 7 PM. She agreed without hesitation. Since we lived downtown, the station was only a few blocks away, so I decided to walk instead of taking an Uber.

The air was cool and crisp as I stepped onto the sidewalk. It was Friday night, and the city buzzed with life. Tourists filtered in and out of restaurants and bars, ready to start their wild nights. The scents of street food mingled with the distant hum of live music created a vibrant collage of city life.

The crowds near the public market seemed thicker than usual. Groups of rowdy adults streamed out of the parking structures, their laughter and chatter echoing off the buildings as they made their way to a concert at the Showbox. Neon lights flickered overhead, casting colorful reflections on the wet pavement, remnants of an earlier drizzle.

Lost in thought about what I was going to say in the interview, I almost missed a fleeting image in my peripheral vision. I could have sworn I saw a large, overweight man standing on the street corner, cloaked in a gray hoodie and wearing a rabbit mask. I snapped my head towards the figure, only to see an older Asian man holding a shopping bag, his eyes focused on his phone through his glasses.

I shook my head, trying to clear the unsettling image from my mind. The streets seemed more crowded than usual, with groups of people milling about, their faces blending into the city's evening blur.

Then I saw another one. This time, it was a slender figure in a fox mask, standing at the entrance of an alleyway, the mask’s painted eyes seemingly fixed on me. Unlike before, this figure didn’t disappear; it remained, an unnerving presence that tracked my every move as I passed.

I quickened my pace, trying to rationalize the sightings. Maybe it was a promotional stunt or some kind of performance art. But the more I walked, the more these figures appeared. A tall man in a wolf mask loitered near a bus stop, his masked face turned towards me. A child in a bear mask peeked out from behind a parked car, their eyes following me intently. They stood still, their masks fixed in my direction, blending into the crowd yet distinct in their silent, unnerving presence.

The crowd thickened as I approached the market area. The festive atmosphere felt increasingly oppressive, the laughter and chatter of the crowd a dissonant background to my rising panic. I weaved through the throng, my eyes darting around, trying to make sense of what I was seeing.

No one else seemed to notice them. A group of teenagers walked right past a person in a bird mask without even a second glance. A couple chatted happily, oblivious to the figure in a deer mask standing right behind them. It was as if I was the only one who could see these eerie figures.

That’s when it happened. A sharp, searing pain tore through my side. An icy chill spread through my body, causing me to stiffen. The sounds of the night faded into a muffled drone, and my vision narrowed and sharpened.

Instinctively, my hand flew to my side. My fingers met something warm and wet. I pulled my hand away and stared at the blood slicking my skin. It was only then that the reality hit me: I had been stabbed.

I stumbled, my back colliding with a cold stone wall. My legs felt like jelly, barely able to support my weight. A woman next to me screamed, her eyes wide with horror as she backed away. I tried to focus on her face, but everything blurred together, the world tilting and spinning around me.

Another man rushed over, supporting my neck as I slumped to the ground. He muttered something in a reassuring tone, but his voice seemed distant. My vision started to fade as he reached down to my side. With a firm but careful grip, he pulled out a long, wavy-bladed dagger. The blade was intricately patterned, each curve shimmering under the streetlights, with an ornately decorated hilt.

The pain intensified for a moment, then dulled as a numbing cold spread through my body. I could hear distant sirens, growing louder as they approached. The man kept talking, trying to keep me conscious. I blinked slowly, fighting to stay awake, the world around me dimming.

The next thing I knew, paramedics were by my side, their voices urgent. They worked quickly, applying pressure to the wound and asking me questions to keep me alert. The stretcher felt hard as the bright lights of the ambulance interior blinded me.
