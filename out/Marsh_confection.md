Ever since that earthquake near my property, the swamp, the very earth of the marsh, has tasted delicious. I discovered it recently, ever since my usual weekend trudge through the thick, vicious mire. 

I stumbled and fell flat on my face, taking mud and slime into my mouth and nostrils, only to discover that the very earth had taken on a delectable candy-like flavor. 

A flavor so unfathomably tasty, the thought of all the nasty microbes and parasites swimming around in your gut upon consumption barely crosses your mind. I immediately bottled up gallons of the stuff, walking out into the swamp to upheave buckets and buckets of creamy swamp muck. 

I named it, ‘Marsh confection’. This incredible discovery not only delighted my taste buds, but saved my business. My modest convenience store now had dozens of regulars, dozens turned to hundreds by word of mouth, as the story of this delicious mystery slime spread far and wide. 

That was, until the man with big boots and a business suit walked into my store, William O’Connell. A pompous rival store owner who outclassed me until this point. He refused to buy the marsh confection, only interrogating its origin.

“It's a disgusting and shady practice, selling people sludge with no label.” He chastised. I waved my hand. 
“The people speak over you, O'Connell. They want their treats. I'm afraid you won't find yours here.” I shooed the man out of my store. 

William clenched his shark teeth and left, unable to secure his kill. He would return the next few months, intent on uncovering the ingredients of the marsh confection, never buying it for himself. 

As the months marched on and the summer began to arrive, the heat of the sun would cook the marsh confection to a nice steamy tart. One summer weekend, I did my usual run through the swamp, carting my wheelbarrow of buckets to the collecting spot. 

I took a second to gander at the area that I had dug out, gallons and gallons of muck had been collected, leaving a very large and obvious channel. My brow raised when I heard slurping and smacking near the slime, and my eyes spotted a small boy hunched over, stuffing the floor into his mouth. 

“Hey!” I shouted at the kid, he instantly raised his head. Water and algae dribbled out of his mouth and he eyed me in surprise.
“I knew it… this is where you get the stuff, and you thought you could keep it a secret!” The boy shouted. 

His clothes were coated in mud, and torn in places. His face looked gaunt, massive bags sagged under his eyes. “I'm gonna…” The boy angrily pointed his finger, before being interrupted by his own belching. 

He gurgled and frothed out the mouth, belching another time before hurling black vomit out of his throat like a fountain. I watched in perplexity as the boy bent back down, and began shoveling the mixture of vomit and mud back into his mouth in his cupped hands.

"Boy… how long have you been here?” I asked. The boy looked back up at me with burning vitriol.
“I'm gonna tell everyone where you get this!” He shouted. He then began to run, though it was more like a slow hobble, I could tell he wasn't in peak condition to traverse the marshy ground.

“KID! NO! WAIT!” I screamed. I absolutely couldn't allow it, I couldn't allow my secret to be revealed. I had begun to live in near luxury because of this discovery, if any single person had their hands on it, I'd lose it all. 

In desperation, I grabbed the closest thing to a weapon I had, a trowel I had brought in my wheelbarrow. I charged at the boy, catching up within seconds due to my familiarity with traversing wet ground. 

I tackled the boy and pinned him to the swamp floor. The boy struggled and squirmed in vain under my weight.
“DON'T YOU TELL A SINGLE SOUL! YOU UNDERSTAND ME BOY?” I hollered in the boy's face. 

He shook his head and writhed with fury.
“GET OFF ME FUCKFACE I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU! I'M GONNA TELL EVERYONE! I'M GONNA TELL THEM ALL!” The boy shouted. 

I desperately tried covering the boy's mouth to shut him up, worrying someone might hear us despite being miles from the nearest property. Screaming and thrashing with all his might, the boy still insisted on revealing my hard kept secret to the entire town. 

I gripped the trowel in my hand hard and clenched my teeth, a crazed vexation possessing my entire being. I slammed my fist down with brutal force and plunged the trowel deep into the young boy’s head, piercing his skull and killing him instantly. 

Dark red ooze gurgled out of the kid's head and mixed into the moist earth. I quickly dug a small hole and buried the boy's lifeless corpse under the muck, licking the mud off my fingers as I went. 

I returned home cautiously, with less stock than usual, as the boy had consumed my time. I had just finished showering off all the dirt when I heard someone pound on my door urgently. Upon opening the door I reeled back in surprise. It was William O'Connell.

“Where's Wolfgang? Where's my boy?” O'Connell spat. I felt my hands begin to dampen, my face flushed.
“I don't know where your- you named your son Wolfgang?” I asked.

“Don't fuck with me Forester! I let Wolfgang play near your property and he hasn't returned home, I just wanted to know if you've seen him.” O'Connell begged.

“You're a terrible liar O'Connell, you sent your son to snoop around, didn't you? It's not my fault he got lost. Go find him yourself.” I replied. O'Connell said nothing as he turned around, making a sour face and stomping away. 

I sneered as he left. However, shock and fear overcame my face as I realized where he was headed. If he searched the swamp, he might find the body, or worse, discover the marsh confection. I had to kill him. 

I had to follow him and shoot him with my rifle. Quickly I threw the firearm over my shoulder and followed O'Connell out into the swamp. I tracked him silently from behind, deep into the swamp.

“Wolfgang! Wolfgang?!” He called out, stepping cautiously through the marshy waters like he had a rash. I could tell he was unfamiliar with traversing such terrain, like the city hippie pussy he is. I waited. We were deep enough into the mire now, nobody would hear. 

BANG! I Shot my rifle into his back. He screamed as he fell to the swamp floor with a squelch. I closed in hastily, aiming my rifle for his face. Through the agony of being shot, he met his eyes with mine, and I hesitated. 

“F-forester?” He whispered with bewilderment. I waited. O'Connell’s panicked, fear filled face twisted into one of pure malice. “FORESTER!!” He howled. I shot again, this time right between the eyes. He stopped moving. 

I picked up his body, the least I could do was bury him next to his son. As I pulled my boots up and down through the mud, I couldn't help but gaze upon O'Connell's face with a sense of sorrow. 

We were business rivals, not mortal enemies, but I had no choice. He would've had my business destroyed, it was my life or his and his son's. I placed his body on the ground, preparing to dig out another shallow grave next to Wolfgang's. 

That's when I saw it, and my heart nearly exploded in my chest. Where I had buried the kid had been completely unearthed, his body was gone. 

I left O'Connell's corpse in the swamp. I anxiously returned home, pondering on what could've happened. Surely some animal dug it up and ate it? Surely Wolfgang wasn't still alive? I didn't want to think about it. 

A few more weeks would pass, and I would forget about O'Connell and his son. An investigation was opened and I was questioned, but they never discovered their bodies. 

I sold that week's batch of marsh confection, and needed to go back into the swamp to get more. But when the time came to journey back into the mire to retrieve more of the treat, I halted. My legs didn't listen, my fingers felt sweaty. 

I did not want to return to the swamp, I was too afraid. I pictured in my head the shambling corpses of Wolfgang and O'Connell, vengeful spirits brought back to haunt me. I know it sounds crazy and irrational, but I couldn't help but feel afraid. 

I decided I would lay off on selling the confection for a while. My customers were furious, demanding I bring them more of the treat. I threw up my hands.
“I'm sorry everyone! It's gonna be a little while before-” 

I began to speak, none of them were having it. They raved, and ravaged my store, even vandalizing it out of anger. They began to show up at my house, and I had no choice but to involve the police. 

The police were no help, however, as most of them had also tasted the confection, unwilling to defend me until I returned it to my shelves. Days would pass like this, people destroying my property, protesting outside my house, demanding I give them marsh confection. 

Eventually I would have to go get groceries, and a mob of people would follow me down the road. I decided I had enough, and I broke down in the street. Falling to my knees, surrounded by screaming people, I yelled out. 

“MARSH CONFECTION IS SWAMP WATER!!” I confessed madly. “DEEP IN THE SWAMP ON MY PROPERTY, A TEN MINUTE WALK, YOU CAN HAVE IT! YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL!” 

Immediately after my confession, everyone surrounding me on the street rushed in the direction of my property, rushing like mad dogs. I stood alone on the noiseless, barren street in solace. For the first time in days, I was completely alone. 

Free from ridicule and harassment. I sat on the concrete sidewalk and smiled. If I had known revealing my secret would feel so freeing, I wouldn't have killed O'Connell and his poor son. Oh well.

The earth swallowed them all. Two hundred and thirteen people died the day I revealed my secret, two hundred and thirteen people swarmed to the bog, eager to feast. 

No doubt they made a day with everyone in town, calling up their buddies and inviting everyone they could to come down to my property. They were all consumed by the swamp. 

The weight of all those bodies, all kneeling down and shoveling the mud into their mouths, caused a disturbance with the very ground, and it gave way. They struggled and dug and writhed, and they all suffocated. 

They choked and choked, I can only imagine the fear and pain. I hoped they spent their last moments happy, submerged in the earth. Imagine that, getting such a treat free of charge. 

I haven't been back to the swamp since, I fear I may catch myself falling in too. I did catch myself licking dried bits of mud off my old boots though. Guess I'll never get over that sweet marsh confection.
