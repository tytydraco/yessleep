It all started two weeks ago.

My parents dragged me to one of their friend’s weddings, with the ulterior motive of introducing me to some “quality men” (translation: finance bros who have less empathy than a garden snail.) People say only children are spoiled, but really, I think we get the raw end of the deal because there’s not another kid to distract them. A hundred percent of their attention is on me.

I ended up escaping when my parents reached the four-drink threshold. Or possibly more? My mom was so plastered she accidentally introduced me as Clara (my name is Carly.) So neither one noticed when I slipped out and found a quiet room to hide out in.

It was there that I met the kid.

I’m not sure her name. She was about seven, with brown hair cut into blunt bangs and big blue eyes, and just walked in after I’d been in there for an hour. She wore a light blue, knee-length dress and shiny black mary jane shoes. The dress was a little wrinkled and dirty for wedding attire, but nice enough that I assumed she was one of the guests’ kids.

I was going to ignore her, but she came right up to me and just *stood* there, staring at me. I could tell she wanted to ask me something, but she was too shy. “You okay?” I asked, turning off my phone.

She nodded.

“Do you need me to find your parents or something?”

She shook her head. Then she pointed vaguely towards the ballroom, where the pounding bass was coming from.

“Your parents dragged you here, too, huh?” I asked her.

She nodded.

Parents. Man. It was bad enough dragging your twenty-five-year-old daughter to a wedding. But your kid? And then just abandoning them? I could be a kidnapper, hauling her off to my white van right now, and no one would even know.

“Sorry. I don’t want to be here, either,” I told her.

She stared down at me with her big blue eyes. “Will you play hide and seek with me?”

“Uh, well…”

“Please?”

She looked so sad. And really, was doomscrolling through engagement announcements and European vacations really more important than making some kid’s day?

“Okay, just one round. But you have to stay close, okay?” I glanced out into the country club’s hallway. “Not upstairs. Only the hallway, and these little rooms.”

She nodded.

I pretended to close my eyes (but actually peeked to make sure she didn’t get herself lost or kidnapped.) “1… 2…” I saw her run down the hallway and dart into the other room. “6… 7…”

“Ready or not, here I come!”

After pretending to look for her in the hallway, I entered the room I’d seen her go into. It was a small game room, with a few tables scattered around, and not many places to hide. I crouched to look under the tables—but it was clear she wasn’t there.

Hmm.

I turned around—and that’s when I saw her, standing in the darkness behind the door.

Just standing there, perfectly still. Staring at me with those big blue eyes. The rest of her body swallowed up in the shadows. “Found you!” I called—but she darted out into the hallway, slamming the door shut.

When I tried to open it… it was locked.

*“You little shit,”* I hissed under my breath. *“I was trying to be nice to you!”*

I panicked for about two seconds, before realizing I still had my cell phone. My dad let me out, and I told him I was leaving.

Before I left, though, I told the groom’s parents that there was some little girl running around unsupervised. The mother looked perplexed, like I’d told her the sky was falling. Too bad. It was no longer my problem.

\*\*\*

Over the following days, I mostly forgot about the interaction, although it nibbled at the back of my mind. *The groom’s parents seemed kind of plastered. What if they didn’t tell anyone? What if someone kidnapped that girl?* I chalked it up to my anxiety talking, although I did ask my parents about it the next time I talked to them.

“I don’t think any kids were at the wedding,” my mom said. “It said on the invitation, no kids.”

“Don’t the groom’s sisters have some kids though?” my dad asked.

“Or maybe a kid of the staff,” my mom added. “I’ve seen that more and more, people bringing their kids to work. I went to the mall and the clerk there had her kid on the iPad next to her…”

And that turned into a monologue about my mom’s adventure buying new pants at the mall. No detail spared.

After the call, I realized I was exhausted. I started making the rounds in my small farmhouse, turning out all the lights, getting a glass of water.

I started up the stairs—and then I saw it.

Sticking out from underneath the living room curtain were two pale lines.

Not lines… *legs.*

All the breath sucked out of my lungs. *Nonono.* For a second, I froze. Then I reached down and flicked the light switch—

Nothing there.

The long, black curtains hung limply from the curtain rod. Were they moving slightly? No, no—it was just my imagination. Besides, even if they were moving, there was a vent right there, and I had the heat on.

It was just my imagination.

I ran over to the window and pulled back the curtains just to make sure. But there was nothing there.

*Just my imagination.*

\*\*\*

I’d only moved into the house a few months ago. It was my first time living alone. My boyfriend was supposed to move in with me, but we’d broken up suddenly.

It was common for me to jump at random noises. To hear the house settling and think someone broke in. To hear the wind howling and think someone was wailing inside the house.

The living room *had* been really dark when I thought I saw the “legs.” Besides, I saw stuff out of the corner of my eye all the time. Sometimes it was my hair, or a trick of the light. I was anxious about living alone. Scared of my own shadow.

That’s what I told myself.

But then it got worse.

A few nights later, around ten, I was laying out my clothes for the morning. I opened the closet, rifling through my blouses, looking for something that didn’t make me look like a forty-year-old mom because I’d forgotten to do the laundry and my only choices were things I hadn’t worn or washed in ages.

Something caught my eye, and I glanced down.

There were mary janes.

Pushed towards the back of the closet, glinting in the low light.

*Attached to two skinny, pale ankles.*

I yelped and leapt back. Slammed the closet door and backed away. *What the fuck?!* My entire body was shaking.

*I saw her shoes. Clearly.* I could see the little straps. The pale skin of her feet. This wasn’t twenty feet away in the dark. *She was right there.*

I stared at the closet door, trembling.

Nothing happened.

I slowly crept towards the door. Heart hammering, I grabbed the doorknob—and pulled.

*Nothing.*

Just my shoes. Heels and flats and sneakers. No little mary janes. I sucked in a breath and stuck my hand into the closet, feeling behind all my clothes. *What if she’s there? What if I feel her cold little hand?*

But there was nothing.

The closet was empty.

\*\*\*

“And when did this all start?”

Dr. Thatcher stared at me inquisitively. I swallowed. I’d never been to a therapist before. My parents looked down on it. *You don’t want to be labeled.* But I was seeing things. I didn’t have a choice.

“After a wedding I went to, a week ago,” I told her.

“And you’ve had a lot of life changes recently,” she said. “You and your partner broke up, and you’ve started living alone.”

“Yes.”

“I don’t think it’s random that you’re seeing a child,” she said. “You said you and your partner disagreed about having kids, which is what led to your breakup, right?”

“Sort of. I actually can’t have kids.”

And no one let me forget it, either. It was only a month ago when I accidentally came across an ultrasound from when my mom was pregnant with me. She ripped it out of my hands like I was made of glass. Like seeing anything related to pregnancy or babies or children would destroy me.

It wasn’t a big deal. I could say it casually. *I actually can’t have kids.* I was fine.

“Ah.” Realization crossed her face. I didn’t like it. “So you’re seeing a child around your home after your partner left you because he wanted children, and you couldn’t have them.”

I crossed my arms. “Yeah, but…”

“And this all happened right after a wedding, where your parents were trying to introduce you to someone new, to help you move on.”

“Well—”

“I think you’re stressed out,” she said, leaning back in her chair. “I think you’ve undergone a lot of life changes recently. It’s a lot. Take some time to slow down. Maybe take a few days off work. Do you have any friends in the area?”

“No,” I admitted. “I’ve only been here a few months.”

“There’s a great gardening club at the library. A lot of young women your age. You like gardening?”

“No.”

“Needlepoint? Mahjong? …Chess?”

I shook my head.

“Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” She let out a chuckle.

“Sorry.”

“Listen, I’ll prescribe you something for the anxiety. And call me if things start getting worse. But I think you’re going to be just fine.”

I didn’t feel fine.

I drove back home. Pulled into the driveway. In the bright light of day, the house looked awful. The white paint was peeling in places. The windows were dirty. Even the cute little pumpkin tower on the stoop couldn’t save it.

I called my parents.

“Can I stay with you for a few days?”

\*\*\*

As soon as I got to my parents’ house, I felt a lot better. Instead of the cold, lonely darkness of the little farmhouse, there were shag rugs and too many lamps and the lingering scent of sugar cookies in the kitchen. Suddenly I agreed with the therapist. Everything would be fine. I’d been freaking out about nothing.

I talked to my parents, which was a whole different can of worms in terms of stress, but at least it wasn’t seeing a child skulking around in the darkness. I called in sick to work for a few days. When my parents went to bed, I felt perfectly safe watching a movie alone downstairs.

Felt perfectly safe going into the kitchen for a snack.

Perfectly safe opening the cabinet for a plate…

*Oh God oh God.*

She was in the cabinet.

Crumpled in on herself, twisted and contorted to fit. Head down, brown hair hanging over her face. I slammed the door shut and screamed.

“What’s wrong?” my mom shouted, racing down the stairs like a wild animal.

“*She’s in the cabinet!”* I screamed, hiding my face. *“She’s in the fucking cabinet!”*

“What the hell is going on down here?” my dad demanded, as he burst in.

“She says someone’s in the cabinet,” my mom said. But I could hear it in her voice. The knowing, the disbelief. Translation: *she’s gone fucking bonkers.*

“Okay,” my dad said, inching towards the cabinet. “Which one?”

“That one,” I said, voice trembling. “With the dishes.”

He reached out and grabbed the handle. Gave it a tug—

“Nothing’s there.”

I opened my eyes. The only thing in the cabinet were plates. And mugs. And an old bottle opener.

She wasn’t there.

“I saw her,” I said softly.

“Saw who?” my dad asked.

I almost said *nevermind,* but then I figured, I looked crazy anyway, what the hell. “A girl. A little girl with brown hair and blue eyes and a blue dress… I saw her at the wedding.”

My parents exchanged a look.

“I saw her in there. *I swear.”*

“It’s late. Let’s go to bed,” my dad said, slinging an arm around me and guiding me up the stairs. My mom followed after, silently. Disturbed. I probably would be disturbed too, if my adult child was claiming to see random ghost kids in the cabinet. I didn’t blame her.

But I saw her.

I knew what happened.

They got me settled in bed and sat with me, like I was eight years old again. “You need anything else?” my mom asked, squeezing my hand.

“I… I guess not,” I said.

“Go to sleep. Everything will be fine in the morning.”

I kept the nightlight on. The little pig one I had since I was a kid. I stared at the two white teddy bears on the dresser. My mom had gotten them when she was pregnant with me. One was pristine, brand new; the other was worn and balding because I slept with it every night. I got up and grabbed it, wrapping my arms around its saggy body. It didn’t really make me feel better.

I heard the low, concerned tones of my parents in the next room. It sounded like they were arguing. Probably arguing about whether they should take me to the doctor at that very second. I could picture it: my mom saying, *but then she’ll be labeled.* And my dad saying, *who the fuck cares, Angie, that’s the least of our concerns right now.*

Eventually, somehow, I fell asleep.

Because when I woke up, the nightlight in my room was out.

It took me a few seconds to get situated. Then I remembered where I was—in my old childhood bedroom. The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling, the pink bedspread…

And I became aware of a presence.

A shadow, sitting on the end of my bed.

She was turned away from me. Her little form was hunched over, her dark hair hanging over her shoulders. I jolted upright, my heart pounding.

“You broke the rules,” she whispered, from the end of my bed.

I opened my mouth to reply. My throat was parched. “I was only trying to keep you safe,” I croaked. “I was worried…”

“You broke the rules,” she hissed.

Then she whipped around to look at me. Her blue eyes almost glowed in the darkness. But there was something horribly off about her face, now. Her expression looked like pure, twisted evil, burning into me.

In seconds she was crawling across the bed towards me, moving unnaturally fast. Her two little hands grabbed my arm in a vice grip. Pain seared through me. I screamed as she grinned down at me, her eyes burning blue.

*“It’s my turn,”* she said, her voice lower than before.

“It’s my—”

The door burst open.

The light flicked on.

I was alone in the bedroom. No little girl. My mom stood in the doorway, breathing heavily. I looked down to see a horrible, burned mark on my upper arm. It hurt like I’d been pressed with a branding iron.

“You saw her again. Didn’t you?” my mom asked.

“Yeah,” I said, nodding, pulling myself up.

My mom slowly came over to the bed. She sat down. When I finally looked at her, I realized she was white as a sheet.

“Carly, I need to talk to you,” she said slowly.

“…What?”

She heaved out a sigh. “This is a lot, so…” She squinched her eyes shut. “Just bear with me. Okay?”

“Mom…”

“When I was pregnant with you…” She stared at the ground, avoiding eye contact. “I was pregnant with twins.”

I froze.

“But the other twin… Clara… she didn’t make it. You reabsorbed her, or whatever the doctors call it.” She finally looked up at me. “When you were born, I was mad at you. I was so angry that it was *just* you, and not her.” Her voice started to shake.

“Mom… what…”

“In the middle of the night… when I was still in and out of it from all the drugs and the birth, and everything… I had this weird dream. I saw this dark figure and I… I saw it holding hands with the girl. The girl you described.” Her voice broke. She was crying. “The figure said… both can live. Twenty-five years for the first, twenty-five years for the second. And… I said yes.”

She hid her face, sobbing. I stared at her, everything hitting me all at once.

*Twenty-five.*

*You broke the rules.*

*It’s my turn.*

The wound on my arm throbbed like fire.
