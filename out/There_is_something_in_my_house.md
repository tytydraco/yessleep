There is something in my house. 

This started about a month ago when I started hearing things, at first I had though I was experiencing auditory hallucinations from being alone so often. Since I barely leave my house, order groceries to my door and barely have friends to invite me out. So my house is my dome.

But because of the frequent hearing I'd door noises that weren't mine, I'd gone to investigate where it came from. So walking from the kitchen to the upstairs bathroom, I noticed that my shampoo bottle had been on my bathroom sink instead of the ridge in the shower. 
  I know that I wouldn't do that, I spend a lot of my alone free time organizing and reorganizing. So I would never have put the shampoo there.

After 2 weeks of those small noticings they had gotten bigger my pots and pans would be splayed out on my living room floor, I would find my TV on my dining room table. This drove me incredibly insane, everything unorganized and out of place. 
I had looked in so many place where this thing could have been hiding. 

One night, I had seen a tall thing out side my upstairs bedroom window. A tall, white thing. Running to the barn just behind My house. I had been creeped out beyond All physical belief. Now i had known there was something in my house, or near it like my barn. 

 Now, in this past week. Things have gone missing instead of out of place, with the biggest thing being 2 of the chairs around my dining table or coffee table in the middle of my living room. 
 I hadn't known where these things had gone, and I was way to stupidly scared to check the barn where that thing had ran off to.

Now as I am writing this, I am in my basement. One I've never dared to step foot in since I've bought this house, I was walking down to get a snack from my kitchen fridge, as scratching came of the wooden basement door. As if a dog had been doing it, a very big dog. 

I made a stupid decision to open the door. The door, opening towards the basement flung open as I leaned against it to force the build up and debris on it to open. 
I fell down a flight of stairs, I just woke up from banging my head so hard I passed out. Looking in front of me, a small light hung from the ceiling. My 2 chairs, my coffee table and a old 70s TV on a dresser from my childhood home which both I stored in my barn had been splayed out in front of me as if someone was making a living down here. 

 The only thing that seems more off than the objects is the non-human like face I see in the mist of darkness that the light bulbs stingy light just can't reachâ€¦ my hands are shaking horribly as I right this. I do not know what this thing wants, but I feel drawn to walk towards it.
