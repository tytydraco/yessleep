im 38 now, this happened when i was just 12, so I may have done some stupid things.

if you read the title, this is my confession, i killed a kid that was a demon, its a long story, but i hope my voice can be heard

it all started in july, when i was 11, when this kid came to school.

The thing was this kid had a problem, and i knew it. His eyes would change colour regularly (every few weeks, or even daily).

the weirdest thing about him was his behaviour, it was like 2 people lived inside him, one person was kindhearted, and another was the most evil, vicious creature i have ever laid eyes on.

until october nothing happened that raised my suspicions, because a house in front of my school was burnt down, how i knew it was him? it was his crush.

his crush rejected him, that was when the second personality came out (the evil one), and he burnt down the house.

that 2 story house was something that ran in her family for over 100 years, it started when someone decided to buy a small amount of land, right near the area where every shops.

now, that kid, who i will call jeffery now, acted like nothing happened, even when they told the school his crush died in that fire.

now, fast forward to march, when i was 12 (my birthday is in february), this kid became more suspicious, when this big football kid died in the bathrooms at school, it was believed he was about to walk home after training, so he went to the toilet, and you can guess what happened.

this caused the school the close for 3 whole weeks, so all the kids in my school had to learn at the high school, including jeffrey.

one thing i knew about jeffrey was he was jumpscared easily, so keep this in mind for later.

that fact came after a high school kid jumpscared jeffrey, who then had a panic attack.

4 weeks later, that was when i had been fed up with this kid, he started stealing my stuff.

the kids parents put him to therapy, thats what i heard, but nothing changed.

when i was very fed up, i followed him into the school hall, where he was writing in a book, standing up in the middle of the damn place, so i jumpscared him..

he froze, and since the area wasnt pitch black, i saw him turn blue, drop his book, and put his hand on his chest, so i bolted out through another hall exit, where i would be in the hall that lead to next class.

I heard that at 1PM, where lunch started, a teacher was preparing for the school dance club, and found jeffreys dead body, and she called the ambulance.

due to the nature of the murder, nobody could be pointed out.

the reason i did it was because i was about to change schools, and this kid had no business being left alone for what he did.

the next day (friday), i suppressed the guilt, i think i forgot it because the class was thanking me for being a good friend at the school.

on monday, i was at my new school, we finally prepared the house on saturday, and we officially moved houses.

i was shocked when i found out that a note was left in the mail box.

**'I will never forgive you, Tylermgyt, for that day. I will never leave you alone, y-'**

it appeared the paper was drenched apart from that line. i was frozen, and threw that paper down the gutter, where it went into a drain.

my parents got me inside, and i told them that i had anxiety because i moved schools, and that i dont know the people, an excuse that was true, mind you, i have anxiety because of random things too.

that night i couldnt sleep, it took a week to get over it.

im writing this now because an hour ago (8PM), i woke up to my wife saying that a ghost was roaming the house, luckily she had a picture.

I think i will never forget that moment again, especially when his vengeant soul is still lurking near me.
