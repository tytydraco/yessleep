It was a Tuesday night around 11:00 p.m. in 2013, and I was walking down a dimly lit  
street at night on my way home from work. My car had been in the shop, so I'd been  
forced to walk 3 miles home every day. The walk was barely an hour, so I was home  
before midnight. I live in a small town in Southern Indiana, so after 10:00, there's rarely  
any cars on the road.

  
The only vehicles you ever see are truckers heading to Indianapolis. I was about a mile  
into the walk when I turned on a dirt road. My house was off the beaten path, so I had to  
take all these dirt roads surrounded by forest to get there. As I was turning, I heard the  
sound of a motor in the distance, and it was getting closer very slowly. I saw about aquarter-mile down the stretch of road I just turned off of a van moving very slowly  
without its lights.

  
At first, this didn't strike me as out of place due to the fact that the town I live in there is  
a pretty cheap car dealership that sells used cars and vans with broken parts like broken  
headlights, so I just assumed this guy was one of their clients. I kept walking down the  
side road with the van still going slowly down the main road.  
About 5 seconds later, I jumped when I heard the sound of the van roar and it sped up  
really fast, except now it had its lights on. I was startled but not worried; this was until  
the van got closer to the turn for the side road. About 500 feet away from the turn, the  
van turned off its lights again and slowed down.

  
Now, I was officially creeped out. I didn't want to seem startled, so I just walked faster  
down the road. I kept turning back constantly to see if I was being followed. Then, my  
suspicions became reality as I saw the van turn onto the dirt road. I was only about 500  
feet from the van, so I started to walk a lot faster.

  
I didn't want to look back, but I did just to be safe, and what I saw frightened every bone  
in my body. I saw the van there stopped with both the passenger and driver's doors  
open. At this point, I ran for my life down the dirt road. I heard what I'm positive was a  
gunshot not far away, and I really thought this was how I was going to die.  
I made a quick turn into one of the surrounding forests and hid behind a big rock. I heard  
what sounded like a middle-aged man not far away say, "I think she went into the  
woods," and then, to my horror, what sounded like three young girls, with one of them  
responding, "okay sir, I'll see if we can find her."

  
Now, I wasn't fearing for my life; I was worrying I was going to be forced into whatever  
sick group this was. I was covering my mouth trying not to make any sound when I  
heard the man say, "whoever finds her doesn't have to drink the blood tonight." A million  
thoughts ran through my head. Is this some sort of satanic cult? Are these girls  
kidnapped? Will I become one of them?

  
I spent what felt like an eternity sitting behind the rock, being scared of any sound that I  
could hear. Then, to my relief, I heard cops nearby. I stayed there just to be safe. When I  
felt the courage to look from behind the rock, I saw red and blue lights right outside the  
forest. I ran out screaming for help, and the cops came to me and said, "ma'am, do you  
know about this body?"
