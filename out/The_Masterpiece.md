Not many people know that there's a dead painter in my backyard. It's true; it's something I tell my dinner guests when they have the capacity to visit, though this prompts them to collect their children away from the backyard beneath which is buried a dead man and scurry off into the night, not a foot ever set back onto my property, it seemed, not for many years.

I once had a child come back to my property after he had grown, and he asked why his parents had collected him so hastily and prevented him from ever coming back to see me again. I told him what I already told you, and what I am about to tell you:

There is a dead painter in my backyard, and you had trapsed upon his grave, and the painter never wanted anyone to do that because he had made his grave and gravestone himself, molded from his paints and paint brushes into a large spire protruding from the dirt before which he dug a large hole, then laid himself down in the hole and did himself in and away, and that spire is fragile, strong against the storm but brittle at the touch of man, no matter how much of a gentle countenance you may bare unto it.

That weekend, the weekend he buried himself, there was a torrential storm, and the elements blanketed the painter with the dirt he had scrounge to the side of his grave. There were two mounds of dirt -- one to its right, one to its flank -- to account for the six feet of Earth removed to make the painter's gate to Hell. Six feet in two miles. And they both individually seemed higher than three feet; they looked more like a stubby four.

The painter had been dead four days by that time, time which conditioned his body to become a loose assortment of rotting skin that decayed into a viscous, liquefied form when the rain struck it; by the time the dirt covered his whole body, only his legs, covered in brown fancy-pants, had not been torn of its skin and turned into a skeleton. No one knew of the painter's corpse in his -- my -- backyard except his mother, who had seen him dead in the hole and consequently lost every fiber of her sanity, never bringing herself to go back outside and bury her baby boy properly, and it was none other but I who was responsible for sending the poor thing to the sanitarium down by the port. She, confined behind whitewashed walls, let God and Mother Nature do the thing she was too mad to do and bury her son.

When time came around to pass the house on (empty houses make great ghosts, after all), I bought it for myself from the painter's mother for nothing more than meager pennies on the dollar, too much of a pittance to the woman to definitely not serve a profit but enough to make a considerable chip in my pecuniary goings-on. After such, I did the most humanly thing possible and fathered five children within the house, one for a different wife. None of them -- children and wife -- stuck around much long after I told them, "Honey, we've got a dead painter in our backyard." I haven't seen the children they took with them to wherever they chose to go -- haven't seen them in up to twenty-two years. Their lives are much too gone now to be mine to see.

I never went outside to unbury the mound that now bulges slightly in my backyard, take steel to the little rise that takes form near my petunia garden as if the Earth itself sprouted a low pimple near a flush of beard. It is not enough of a mound to bother flattening it, though proves enough of a nuisance that I do trip and fall over it as I see more time pass and kill my bones. The painter was a friend; I cherished him more than his own father, a wretched bastard who made him a bastard. Anyway, I have died enough that I cannot do anything myself anymore, without hired assistance, because that pecuniary hole still hasn't entirely closed, still bleeds.

Look out to the spire. It's faded, its colors now gray and dim, out by the tree line. It's conspicuous enough with enough of a foot into the past that, with a little strain from easement, you can see it, pronounced against dark bark. Beneath it, though offset in front of it a foot, are the remains of a dead painter. A dead friend. I believe that if you dig up his bones, there in the dirt they will be, and absorbed into the dirt will be all the paint he consumed to kill him. When I'm dead and gone, you can go and unbury him, if you so like; I regret enough not burying him, that I would never unbury him consciously, never as long as I am driven by my remaining moral fiber.

When I give up this house, you will be the only person to decide for my painter friend: do you leave him to peace, or do you do the proper thing, wake him up, violate his homespace, give him God's proper burial, God's proper sendoff, though his slumber has been fifty years going? Now, for me, think of it if you must, but never enact upon it. If you are so compelled, just go over and stick a sign in the ground, stick a knife in his door. Or paint over the faded, painted words of the painter's name up on the spire, around and to its back, if you so wish to demean his masterpiece. Repaint this house, paint my coffin red before you paint it blue, but you don't repaint the strokes of an artist's signature. You let it pronounce its worth, and let its worth pronounce it. If it has worth, it will stay and keep its eye on us. If it has none, then I believe you can muster enough intelligence to find out what happens thus.

And, too, when you bury me, bury me far from my friend, next to my mother, not my father or my children. Both have lived lives I don't want to hear about and am not obligated to know anymore. In Heaven, I would still like to rest my head on my mother's lap and let out seventy years a sigh. I do not know what compelled the death of my friend. I don't want to meet him in Heaven. I want his spire and his memory -- not, never, the truth that led to either.
