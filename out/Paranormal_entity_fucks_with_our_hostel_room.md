I (18M) am currently a med student in Delhi and this is how i started believing in bad energy, back in class 10 during the annual board exams our school gave us holiday so all 350 hostelers just stayed inside and studied and fucked around.  
we were being suddenly called to school for our pre board tests the coming monday, after having studied fully, I went to sleep and woke up the next day , 2 hours after school started, "huh? didn't the bell ring?" I asked my roommates (rooms were comprised of 6 beds 3 on each side of the wall, and cupboards to separate them). I dont have pictures of the rooms on me but pretty sure its on the school website of "the asian school dehradun" or on the google maps attached images. Anyways, my friend came into our room with about 14 guys and they were dancing around, when i asked the they said the pre board test was cancelled. why? i asked "behenchod Anil died last night" they said, though everyone spoke hindi they spoke english to me since I am north eastern.  
my friend parth got up and shouted at them, WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU CELEBRATING A DEATH IN THIS ROOM, GO DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.  
Parth was a rich pussy who believed in negative energy, he was a new hosteller, that night we made a plan to scare the shit out of him, we called stanzin, a small ladakhi dude who could fit into parths bedside cupboard, we waited until 11:30pm as thats when they switch off the building lights, he comes in the room and we chat for a few minutes until stanzin knocks slightly on the door,we pretended not to notice and he did too, he knocked again, a bit louder now, "did you hear that" bhavesh said, he was black as balls so i could see his teeth in pitch black smiling widely, and then \*THUD THUD THUD\* stanzin bangs loudly, Bamang taison runs out first trying to hide his laugh and I go out second and quickly jam the door shut behind me, parth comes running out "maderchod(motherfucker) maderchod!" he screamed, the warden heard this and came to investigate, fucker hadnt fallen asleep yet, Parth being the pussy he is tells him everything and the warden came inside to investigate, stanzin had run off to his room the moment he heard the warden shout from his room. He told us to sleep otherwise he'd beat us with his javelin( he did that to some of the students bad in studies). Parth said he was going to sleep in another room and we just laughed at him, sanay egged him on to stay in the room and he agreed, that night was full of snickers and grins shared between us, sometimes Rajdeep would knock on the cupboard beside his bed, we all knew it was him but still I started feeling uneasy, I was glad to see i wasnt the only one as looking across, bhavesh had moved and faced the wall, probably scared, me and Rajdeep exchanged some swear words and we slept. This night was when i started sleepwalking.

The next day we planned to do it again but stanzin wouldnt agree so no one did anything, but Rajdeep kept knocking on his cupboard, we were getting sick of this so me and taison sat up to scold him, he wasnt on his bed, he was in the shitter, the room started blaming me for knocking as the sound came from my cupboard but i didnt do anything, so i thought they had convinced stanzin again and I opened my cupboard door slowly so as to not show anything to Parth, it was empty, Parth went out again to sleep in another room, taison told me stanzin was in the multipurpose cupboard at the end of the room, i checked and sure enough he was there, we did some more fucking around until stanzin went back to his room and Parth came back after we called him a pussy, we were just about to sleep until we heard a thud from the multipurpose cupboard, I looked around and everyone looked just as shocked as I was, except for sanay who was trying to hide his smile, he later said sorry it was me, and some shit happened inbetween which ultimately led to me saying theres nothing there and that i would open the multipurpose, my plan was that i would say its stuck to fuck with everyone, when i pulled it, my heart sank, it was fucking stuck, Taison came and pulled hard aswell, sure enough he broke the handle, I noped out of the room with my blanket and pillow and slept in another room, everyone else also quickly followed behind except for bhavesh. We told out neighbours about this the next day and they started making up bullshit stories about how they also had the same experience, obviously trying to scare us, right?

From the next night onwards nothing happened, except at 1:50 exact there were 3 knocks on our door, no one wanted to check so we left it at first, same shit happened the next day and the next, we couldnt  study anymore, we were starting to get scared, until we probably thought it was our neighbors and so came up with a plan, that night, we would all gather at the door at 1:50 and open it just as we heard it, sanay,cricket bat in hand said "its 1:50", a few seconds later we heard a knock and we opened the door before he could knock it a second time, nothing was there, I jumped as though i touched an open wire and grabbed my pillow and blanket, I was not sleeping there again, as soon as i closed the door behind me and took 2 steps, my roommates fling the door open, they were pretty mad, "this isnt a joke behenchod dont fuck around!" turns out they heard 2 knocks after i closed the door. I didnt sleep that night, instead i went back into that room after breakfast and slept during the day. The occasional weird shit would happen like someone sleeptalking, and the 1:50 knocks still happened. one notable event was that taison had seen a pitch black man wearing a black fedora type hat standing behind the shadow cast by my open cupboard looking down at my sleeping body. Parth suggested later that we do positive shit around the room like meditations, praying etc, and it worked! nothing no longer happened, when we went home for vacations i told my dad who is a member of the church and he educated me about energy and portals, he even told me a neat story of how he exorcised a spirit from his students.

I have no long term trauma related to these events and luckily, nothing has followed me since, but the only thing I retained from that day was my constant sleep walking, sleep talking, and sleep paralysis, 

pretty cool experience to tell my future kids I guess
