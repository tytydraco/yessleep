Let me start by saying that I come from a long line of cynics. To be completely honest, I have always looked down my nose at fully grown adults who get themselves worked up over ghosts and spirits. 

It was a real pet peeve of mine as even when I was a child I would chuckle when my father would stand outside my door whispering, chuckling and lightly knocking on wood late at night in a desperate bid to frighten me, I was just simply never convinced by any of it. The wholehearted belief that none of the paranormal rubbish is real was my blanket on cold stormy nights and in eerie liminal moments throughout my life. 

As of last Friday, the fiery blaze of the blinding truth has rendered that blanket all but disintegrated after the realisation I have suffered. There’s still so many burning questions in my own mind so no answer or explanation I can give you for all for this will be satisfactory. Therefore, you’ll have to forgive me as all I can do is organise my thoughts on here and try tell the story as it unfolded. I need something tangible, something that will stay unchanged and whole after I have written my about my experience. I, Bert Myers, of sound mind declare this to be a true recollection of the horrific relationship that has been formed between me and the bartender I met at the airport last week. 


 In the early hours of Friday morning I hovered absent-mindedly outside of Bristol airport, dragging on the remnants of a hand-rolled cigarette. As the rich, orange embers gathered beneath my moustache for the last time before I flicked the waste away, I couldn’t help but get that strange dream-like sensation. That kind of discomfort that can’t easily be described;  like being in school at night or swimming in an empty pool room. 

I felt utterly disconnected from the entire world as I pulled the handle out from my suitcase and began to amble towards the entrance. My flight wasn’t for another hour and half but I was revelling in the procrastination. I now think in the back of my mind maybe I wanted to miss it, maybe my subconscious knew what dark forces were at play past those revolving doors. Or maybe I’m still just reeling and grasping for any explanation. 

I’m not gonna bore you with the exciting tale of how I checked in and went through security, all you need to know is that somehow I ended up in a bar half an hour before my departure. Flying is bad enough but flying sober, no chance. I may be 27 years old but I don’t think it’s childish to fear soaring over miles and miles of endless ocean in a big metal mimicry of a bird. I hardly noticed the bar was empty as I twirled the remnants of whatever cheap gin they had round in the bottom of the glass. I remember every deflated flick of my wrist in that moment, my final moment of normality. 

“A nervous flyer, I take it?” 

My veins went icy hot for a moment as his voice crashed through my whole body. The loud shatter of the almost empty glass I pushed off the bar made the sudden shock I felt rapidly dissipate into embarrassment as i met the eyes of the bartender. 
The feeling of embarrassment was instantly replaced. 

No wonder I had not noticed him. Despite the fact he was tall and distinctive looking, he was rail thin and made no sound before he was in front of me. The kind of thin that looks emaciated, non-human even. Looking back, I was quite clearly staring at him and for good reason. His skin hung loosely on him as if it were a well used onesie yet it was smooth, without a wrinkle like a freshly ironed shirt. His steep grin and almost phosphorescent teeth unnerved me even further as his dark red lips contorted around his noticeably widening mouth, it almost looked as if the skin would snap as he stretched his expression further and further. 

He couldn’t have been older than 40, with deep set and soulless black eyes sitting unnaturally in his face like pebbles. It was almost as if he was looking through me, like he didn’t know where to look so settled on the middle of my face. His hair, or what there was left of his hair, clung lazily to his head as if glued on in some insulting imitation of a wig. I tried to stop staring and before I could force out an ever so British apology he continued.

“Oh wow sorry about that! My patrons aren’t usually so jumpy”

He let out a sound that reminded me of a chuckle but sounded like a shoddy impression, almost sarcastic. I then noticed his perfect mannequin-like hand slowly approaching my wetted forearm with a tea towel. Again, perhaps this is my mind still trying to cope with the week’s events but I distinctly remember every synapse in my brain howling, screaming at me to pull away before he made contact. However, not wanting to be even more rude I let him clean me off. 

“I’ve never liked flying.” 

As my short and blunt reply escaped my now tense throat I became aware of the fact that he was still touching me. Immense relief flooded through my brain as I pulled away from his oddly sharp fingernails. They didn’t look sharp before he started touching me. I fumbled awkwardly for my bag, not breaking eye contact for a second, and began making my way to my flight, which now seemed a saving grace as it could get me away from the skin-crawling interaction.

In an instant, everything changed as the most haunting 2 sentences I have ever heard shook me to my core.

“Where are you going? Your flight isn’t for another 25 minutes, Bert!” 

Now that I think of it, the sickening enthusiasm he delivered that taunting question with turns my guts to boulders hanging on my skeleton. His still somehow widening grin and unblinking, unchanging eyes conveyed one message to me in that moment as I looked back fearfully at him. It was as if he was saying, victoriously.
“Got you.”

Adrenaline began to flow through me with a powerful unsatisfiable itching. I had to get out of there. 

The rythmic squeaking of my soles on the floor grew faster and faster as I made my way to my gate now ever so desperate to put distance between me and whatever he was. A nauseating panic began to settle over my mind like rain droplets in a forming thunderstorm as I slowly began to realise that squeaking was the only sound I could hear. 

The airport wasn’t busy, rare for Bristol. Maybe a dozen people wandered around in my eye-line but as I scanned desperately for one of them to dispel my unease, it only stoked the flames of my fear. Not only were they all silent as the night, but they all moved slowly and indecisively. As if none of them had any place to be, just stumbling and circling and stumbling and circling. 

I pushed my mounting horror to the back of my mind as my gate came into sight. As the metres between me and my departure gate closed rapidly, I realised I was passing another bar. A persistent thought sat in the back of my mind like an alarm clock with no snooze, waiting to be answered.

“I bet he’s there” 

As if the move had already been decided by my bones the second the thought formed in my brain, I glanced over through the entrance of the other bar. No one was there. I breathed a small sigh of exhausted relief and chuckled. Perhaps, in my late night journey the sleep deprivation had got to me. I slowed to a walk but then the silence became infinitely noticeable as my squeaking disappeared. 

The shattering of glass distantly behind me brought back that agonising icy hot sensation running through my veins. I glanced over my shoulder like a deer in headlights and my feet failed under me as I met his gaze. His traumatising smile had now become a toothy grimace, like a distant predator stalking his prey waiting for it to get tired. 

To call the bartenders smile toothy is wrong. They were not the haunting doll-like teeth he had before in the bar. The sight of the unnatural and comically large pale white reflective razorblades being brandished at me will haunt my quietest moments forever, I can still see the blinding glint coming off them. He watched me as I scrambled on my wobbling, faltering joints to get some traction under me. He didn’t move and somehow that just made me want to move faster. As I passed under the neon yellow sign holding my gate number and ran down the tube towards the plane door I took one more look as curiosity bested me. I wish I hadn’t. 

The dozen people in my eye-line had now doubled, maybe even tripled. Furthermore, they now stood still, each one glaring sharp and petrifying daggers at me. A choked yell escaped me and hot tears began to stream down my face. The bartender was no longer smiling. I now noticed his abnormally tall skull sitting seemingly uncomfortably under his skin as he glared at me with unmistakable rage.

I turned the final corner and the entrance of plane came Into view. Warm yellow light flooded out of the doorway and a beautiful and welcoming looking flight attendant stood there smiling. As my eyes met with her I heard the rapid succession of hard shoes on the marble floor of the airport just a few dozen feet behind me. The bartender was getting closer and he sounded inhumanly fast. I ran past the flight attendant praying by some miracle that he would not follow me.
