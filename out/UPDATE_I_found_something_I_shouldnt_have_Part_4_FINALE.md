I didn’t know if I was going to post after the past few days. But everything was already typed up and saved I just… sat on it I guess. But now I’ve decided I don’t care. Whatever happens to me happens. After I posted part three, some oddities happened on my account. I’m not going to dive into theories I’m just going to state the facts. I posted. Next morning, posts were still saying pending although they had comments and upvotes. Then they were all taken down as well as everything in my profile. I tried refreshing pages, rebooting routers, but nothing worked. Few hours later everything was back to normal after I called Jack and he did some backend computer work I couldn’t begin to comprehend or explain. For the story thus far, I’d normally post a link in the beginning of this to each part, but I’m gonna ask you to just go to my profile. The other parts are all there. For those already caught up, continue reading.



It’s like someone knew I was onto something and tried to wipe it, but failed. Then it happened. I got a call from Jacks mom. Not too weird but definitely out of the ordinary. She was panicked I could tell immediately. Asking if I heard from Jack. I hadn’t since the day before when he fixed my account. She went to his apartment this morning and his car was in the driveway but no sign of him. I told her I’d try to call then get back to her. The phone rang but immediately went to voicemail. I called back his mom and told her. She was going to the police. I tried to talk her out of it saying I’d try looking first some more. Thank god I couldn’t. I agreed to meet her at the station. Mother’s intuition is a crazy thing sometimes.



She was arguing with the officer who was clearly a kid fresh out of the academy who was just trying to follow procedure. He politely and professionally told us we can’t file a missing persons report for 48 hours. Jack’s mom wasn’t hearing it, and shortly thereafter, a detective overhead and came over looking more like he was trying to save the front desk officer than have genuine interest in our case. He sat us both down and asked what happened. We told him what we know, gave him Jack’s information, and he started to dial his phone right at his desk. “Sure you wrote down the right number, kid?” He asked me.



I looked confused. It was the right number for sure. “Says the number is no longer in service.” He added. “That’s impossible. It went to his voicemail recording this morning.” I replied. The detective looked at me slightly puzzled, wrote something down, then said he’d be in touch. He shook our hands and gave us his card in case there were updates. I told Jack’s mom I’d continue to do what I could and we went our separate ways. My head was spinning. This all had to be tied together, right? Something was telling me that whatever was going on with Jack was someone’s (or something’s) revenge for finding what we did. I went home and poured back over the rest of the journal I had already scoured. Here it is for you guys to see:

February 20th, 2025



Dive day. The plan this morning is to go meet with Captain, then get all our equipment and monitoring devices set up and checked before we do final checks with the divers. I also forgot to mention the divers. Because they have to basically free-dive at that depth, they’re in a saturation chamber to acclimate their bodies to the pressure at depth. Normally for commercial sat divers, they need weeks of living in a pressurized chamber. But the Navy brought over some special saturation chamber they had on the aircraft carrier. That mixed with a newly developed intravenous cocktail, they only needed 24 hours in the chamber before going to the dive bell. Its going to be difficult to run final checks since they go directly from the chamber to the dive bell. But if I’ve seen anything in my time on board this ship its that everyone is oddly prepared. and by “everyone” I mostly mean the Navy. Having contingencies or plans in place like they had trained for this. 



The dive is scheduled for 0357UTC (11:57pm EST for reference). From what I’m told, conditions are ideal topside, both weather and currents included. I got to see the monitoring station where I’ll be during the dive. It is the newest and most high tech equipment. Looked fresh out of the box. I have a team of five people under me. James was my number two and we had three additional techs from MaritimeX. I’d be overseeing the dive in its entirety, monitoring the live footage from the diver helmets on a set of computer monitors. Id also have a headset with a direct line to the divers. No delays or interference at all. Or so I’m promised. Some sort of military tech. Obviously this being a military-involved operation, all the civilians were made to sine nondisclosure agreements. I didn’t know if i fell in the “civilian” or “military” category, so this journal is sort of a legal gray area. I like to tell myself that at least.

February 21st, 2025



My god. It was terrible. So terrible. Theres so much to tell I don’t know where to begin. My heart is pounding and my brain is racking itself trying to find some logical explanation for all of this. I’ll start from the morning of the dive. James and I ran through the plan once again with the team in the monitoring station. The techs ran us through a quick demo of how to use the basic parts of the dive cameras. I had a set of four screens in front of me. Three showing the helmet and body camera footage from each diver, and the fourth was from a submersible ROV unit that I was able to freely control. The techs set it up so it was operated with a video game style controller. Easy enough for anyone to use with some basic pointers. James had the same setup.





The divers exited their chambers into the dive bells. The adorned their suits. These weren’t the big astronaut looking ones you normally see in saturation divers that were hooked to the bell by a lifeline (a series of intertwined cables feeding air, hot water, and other important necessities straight to the diver suit). They still had helmets encapsulating their whole head, smaller, and atop sat a series of lenses and goggles that could be dropped down and interchanged. The suits were sleek, but clearly reinforced. Sort of like Iron Man, but less flashy and more subtle. A worker came over to each diver and used a power drill to secure the bolts of the helmets to the suits at the neck area. Then again but this time around the wrists and ankles where the gloves and boots met the rest of the body. We could see them through a glass wall that separated us from the airlock where the chamber met the bell. The divers gave a thumbs up to the worker, then each other.



On the wall near them were three assault-rifle style looking objects. Each diver picked one up and sighted it down and checked around on some features I couldn’t make out. They weren’t normal guns. But definitely a gun. Some sort of advanced infantry-style weaponry. I noticed their dive knives were located in sheaths on their shoulders. Thats a more tactical placement. Divers in my experience keep them somewhere on the thigh. The more and more I stared, the divers appeared to have combat features on their suits. They looked at us and tested communications. Before I could ask what the guns were, Captain Downes came over my shoulder and pressed the comms button. “Loud and clear.” He said into the headset microphone I was wearing. He and the divers exchanged another thumbs up then they disappeared, one by one into the diving bell.



“Weapons?” I looked up and asked Downes. “It was need-to-know at the time. Had to get you here no matter what.” He replied, looking almost apologetic. “Its alright.” I replied. And I was genuine, it was more so the confusion of why need weapons on a dive? I’d never heard of that. “But why?” I added. Captain Downes stood up and signaled me over to a corner of the room, away from James and the other techs. “I know you saw the shadows in those videos. I saw it in your eyes. It was the same look I had the first time I saw one. We have every reason to believe whatever these “openings” are down there, they’re letting something in. Humanoid, shadow like creatures. They don’t move normally, they can fly freely through the water as if it isn’t there, teleport from one location to the next, its unlike anything we’ve ever seen.” He was talking hurriedly, what seemed like a mixture of fear and excitement, but most of all uncertainty. 



“We’ve only got one recorded interaction, and it was brief. Caught on a stationary dive cam down in the site. One of our floodlights had broken just as one of those shadows was next to it. Although we caught it in a frame-by-frame analysis, the thing totally dissipated briefly, then reformed once the electric burst from the lightbulb was extinguished. The weapons they have are precautionary. Military has contingency for everything. The guns fire high frequency, targeted electromagnetic waves inside an artificial air pocket that will burst upon contact with target. Tested thoroughly, and is all but ready for widespread military use. If all goes well, you’ll hear about it in the news within the coming months. This was all so much. But I was relieved in a sense. I’m glad I wasn’t crazy in seeing those shadow-things. Even more glad I wasn’t the one to have to bring it up.



The dive bell was hoisted off the deck of the ship by a large hydraulic crane. It was suspended over the water, then it dropped, maintaining a thick rope of intertwined wires and tubing that were kept together with a transparent nylon material. The dive bell was connected to the ship, sharing its air and heating regulation systems, as well as direct communication lines to the vessel. It took about four hours to reach the site. Once it arrived, the bell stopped descending and sat hovering over the sunken cul-de-sac. Another equipment and communications checklist run-through for both the dive team and us, and then the hatch at the bottom of the bell opened. 



A cage descended with three walls jutting out from the center, and each diver was standing in their own tight section of it. Inside the bell stayed one technician diver who maintained the systems inside and kept in contact with the surface. A latch opened on the cage and each diver stepped out. What looked liked air hissed out from the tops of the dive suit’s backpacks, and all three divers were swiftly propelled downward, slowing once their boots reached the ocean floor. Their boots lit up at the soles, almost looking like they had magnetized to the surface. The nerd in me was going crazy over getting to see all this new technology the military doesn’t tell us about. But part of me also knew that if they were willing to take the risk of civilians being exposed to it, whatever is going on here is serious, and maybe out of military control.



The divers fanned out like a tactical unit, sweeping their immediate surroundings with the flashlights mounted on their guns, as well as the ones protruding from their suits. I watched through each divers live feed. It was in first person and I was so engrossed in the screen it was eerily feeling like I was down there with them. I was happy I wasn’t. They went into the first house. Furniture floated around lifelessly. Some light creeped in through broken windows coming from the floodlights we had set up around the perimeter of the site. Nothing substantial enough to warrant unaided visibility though. 



Ray’s camera view looked down as he removed a device from his belt. It was some sort of device giving off electromagnetic radiation readings, with a bar of color going from green on the left, then transitioning to yellow, then red on the right. A needle danced in the center of the green area. Ray pointed it around some more, stopping on one direction where the needle spiked briefly. He looked up and over, waving his hand in the direction the device was pointing. The Dan and Jen nodded, and the three stacked up in a line, walking forward toward a set of stairs. Slowly and methodically, they moved up the stairs, each step seeming to lock in place from their boots. But they moved with ease.



Dan was the first at the top of the stairs. He looked to his left, then right. A small hallway on either side, one section led to the open ocean through a decimating hole in the roof. The other side had a room with no door. The team moved in, clearing it quickly. A crib floated pushing up on the ceiling, and stuffed animals with frayed or missing appendages floated in a corner by a small bookshelf adorned with colorful children’s books. Ray looked back down at the device. “The needle still resided in the green zone. “Clear.” His voice echoed in the headset in my ear. The team then free swam out of the house via the hole in the roof and then over to another semi-standing house’s rooftop. Something beeped and then Ray’s camera showed the device again, with the needle in the center of the spectrum now, locked in place in the yellow. “Entering.” Jen said. They swam through a broken window that they were able to pull the frame out of. When they were inside, their boots locked back into the floor. They swept each room. Two bedrooms and a bathroom. All so out of place this deep underwater. The place was furnished, but it was allegedly a test site? It looked lived in. But then why the mannequins? I had more questions than answers. 



Before I could think of another All three dive cameras lit up bright white. After a second or two, they dimmed, and all of them were fixated on what was in front of them of them. They were getting ready to go down to the first floor of the house when at the bottom of the stairs, a glowing purple slit appeared in front of them, surrounded by pulsating grayish-black stone like objects, lit up by the back glow of this opening. Before anyone could say anything a shadow whipped out of the portal and then it closed. The room was dark again. Still. Like it should be 15,000 feet underwater. Only right now, it shouldn’t have been. 



“CLEAR TO ENGAGE!” Captain Downes grabbed the headset off me and yelled into the microphone piece. Before I could talk to him he ran over to the satellite phone hooked on the wall. I watched as the divers’ views all went in different directions, the shadow figure dancing between the monitors my eyes were locked on. A flurry of bright shots emanated from their weapons, and one seemed to make contact. Everyone immediately grabbed their heads. A shriek so loud it felt like my brain was being violently shaken screamed in my skull. I imagine the same thing for everyone happened as we all briefly convulsed in agony. 



I looked back at the dive cameras. The creature began to dissipate, but then through Jen’s camera, I could see it wrapping itself around Dan. He was unable to move. Locked in place. I could see his face and his eyes went black. His veins glowed in his face and down his neck. His mouth began to open as if to say something, and then, the creature stretched out an elongated arm and simply tapped the glass on the face of Dan’s helmet. The creature disappeared and in the same second, I saw Dan return to his body. The real dan. He looked shaken. Then immediately panicked. Before I could realize, a huge crack in the glass formed covering his face. And then… it was like a red mist just kind of spilled out when the pressure caved it in. I looked away. 



“DIVE TEAM RETURN TO BELL NOW!” The diver in the bell screamed over the shared communications line. The lights in the room shut and were replaced with a glowing red one. Over the PA system an automated voice said all too calmly: “This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations. This is a lockdown. Remain in your stations.” Then it stopped sounding. My gaze fixed back to the divers. It would take them about a half hour to get back to the dive bell and they knew they didn’t have time to spare. I could feel the ship began to move. Within ten minutes it was shaking violently. I could see through a window that a violent lightning storm had seemingly come from nowhere. Thunder clapped and rain poured shortly thereafter. I waited as the divers were still a little bit aways from the safety of the bell. Although as each minute passed, the dive bell became less safe. The ship 15,000 feet above it, connected by a long run of wire, violently being tossed around ten to twenty foot waves. 



Static began to crackle in and out of all the screens in the room. The techs assured me it wasn’t the machines, but rather “outside interference.” That was the term they used. The monitors came back on after awhile and I could see that Jen and Ray’s dive cameras were looking up at the bell, getting closer and closer to being right below it. Again, a bright light filled their screens, as well as the submersibles. I had been following them loosely on their way back seeing as the ROV couldn’t fit into any of the structures.



The monitors focused again and Ray and Jen looked at the seabed around them. Those purple tears were popping up left and right, shadowy humanoids, some crawling, others dashing their way out of these openings. There was more darkness than there was light. The only thing I could see was Jen’s camera looking up at the dive bell. Shadows danced around the cable atop it, as it floated in the surrounding ocean. Then one of the things passed through the wire, leaving a glowing purple line sizzling through the circumference of the cable. Then another. And another. The glow subsided, and the cables simply just… separated. The bell began to slowly sink down before landing a few hundred feet in front of the divers. Jen’s camera looked over to Ray, and a shadow disappeared as it flew into him. Like Dan, his eyes went black and his veins glowed. Then, all the computers in the room shut. Static then off inna instant.



The room was quiet. “All crew on deck. All crew on deck.” Came over the PA system in the same, stoic voice. I checked my watch. 1239UTC. Sunset exactly. I guess the situation warranted no more curfew. The deck was loud and windy, still pouring rain. Captain Downes stood out there, waiting for us all to file out. He had a tablet in front of him. “RAMIREZ, HANSON, JACKSON, DAVIS, WILLIAMS, TYLERS, WATKINS, AND JONES. FOLLOW ME!” He yelled over the gusting wind and rain. There were a lot of armed soldiers on board now. Once Downes walked them out past the main deck, James being one of them, down toward the port side and out of our sightline, the guards lined up in front of us, forming a sort of blockade. “YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR QUARTERS.” One barked at the few of us left.

We were individually escorted back to our rooms and then a guard shut the door behind me. I assumed he was still standing outside. On the way to me room though I saw something. Glancing out a window on the port side, I caught a glimpse of Captain Downes, arm extended toward something out of my view. Then a flash. Followed by him stepping to the side with another flash following. Like he was moving down a line. Were those names of people he read a kill list? I don’t know. I’m going to lay down but I’m sure as hell I won’t sleep.

February 22nd, 2025



My dreams were haunted by shadows. Figures I felt like I knew but couldn’t see. They all watched me. Staring. Studying. i woke up in a cold sweat. We were all woken up at the crack of dawn and the entire crew was in the dining area. Nobody mentioned on Captain’s list was there. The weather had calmed and I could hear a helicopter whirring overhead. It sounded close and then I could hear an engine powering down. Within minutes the General who had given us our initial briefing walked in, followed by Captain Downes. Nobody stood up. “You are all here because you can be trusted. The situation that unfolded here is to be referred to as a research study that yielded no results. No more details are to be given. To anyone. Ever.” He said firmly. “You will all be compensated generously for your assistance in this endeavor. As of this moment, this vessel as well as all equipment on it is property of the United States military. Go back to your quarters. Those of you with held equipment will find it returned upon your arrival. You have 1 hour to gather yourselves and report to the helicopter on deck.”



Nobody had time to raise their hand before they both exited the room. On the way back to my quarters, I took a detour outside. I examined the lower deck of the port side. Where I saw Captain last night. A guard was strolling a post up and down the length of the side. I crouched behind a container and moved quickly across the way to the railing of the ship, covered by a staircase. I traced the railing down as far as I could, but found nothing. While turning back around I heard a small clank at my foot. I moved my shoe aside and found a 9mm shell casing. I looked down the length of the deck and behind me and found two more that rolled up against the bottom of the staircase. That was enough to confirm my theory. The curfew. The list. That was the time they executed those who they didn’t think would be able to keep this under wraps. Innocent people who were here a week ago on their own. Researchers. Genuine researchers. Studying the world. Not whatever the hell they got dragged into.



I returned to my room, sat for a few minutes, planning my next move. I’m going to return to the monitor station, take the hard drive loaded with movies and shows to pass time, wipe it, then download a copy of the ships data. Theres a main system I was given access to that nobody else on my team was. It stored everything in one place, so I could download from there. After that I’d make a move for one of the life vessels that could be piloted hanging off the side of the deck. Wherever that helicopter was going was not somewhere I wanted to be. I’ll figure the rest out when I get back to land. 



………



Same day but last entry. I’m in the lifeboat now. Once I left my room I made my way to the monitoring room. I plugged the drive in and began waiting. It was moving slow. Each increase in completion percentage feeling like hours. Thats when it happened. A guard walked in. The one that barked at us last night on dec to get back inside. “You’re not supposed to be in here!” He said assertively, raising his rifle at me. I lifted my hands, my eyes quickly darting away from the hard drive sticking out from the computer next to me. I hoped he wouldn’t, but he noticed and then told me to get on my knees. I obliged. As he walked over I quickly threw myself up and into him, pushing him toward the nearest wall. 



We were around the same size. While he was still stunned I jammed my elbow into his forearm and he dropped his assault rifle and it fell to his hip, still attached to the sling over his shoulder. We grappled arms and he swept my leg from under me. I dropped, but wrapped myself around him, pulling him with me. HE landed on top, throwing blows at my head as I threw up my arms to cover myself. I managed to block one and grab his hand. In the same instant I dislodged the knife from his shoulder harness and lifted it up about and inch and turned it, pushing into the side of his neck. His fight weakened and his eyes widened. Blood seeped from the wound as he grabbed at the knife, stammering to do so while falling off me and onto the floor. He stopped moving shortly thereafter. 



I looked up at the computer and the screen displayed a completed message. I yanked the drive out and walked out of the room, catching my breath and trying not to think about what happened in there. I had to move fast though. I decided to just run for it. Within a few seconds I was mantling over the side of the ships railing and onto the life vessel. I turned the hatch and entered. The craft booted up upon me locking the latch. “Prepare for release. Prepare for release.” A loudspeaker said. The craft dropped and then landed softly, bobbing for a second and then settling, swaying slowly. I ran through the checklist sitting on the pilot seat. Simple enough. 



The engine whirred and the ship sailed away under my command. I just turned it away from the scene and pushed the throttle full. About ten minutes went by and a huge flash filed the cabin. I looked out the back porthole as a huge half orb of lightning exploded from the ocean surface encapsulating the airship, research vessel, and all nearby boats, looking as if it descended down into the depths below as well. A purple glow filled the orb and lightning flashed everywhere. Then, everything inside disappeared. A large series of waves rushed out, causing some large bumps in the life vessel ride for a minute or so. I don’t know whats next. I don’t know where is safe. I remember something about an island I had written coordinates for before we got onboard the ship. Related to this place. Seems like a good place to look for answers. Because I have more questions than answers.



…



And thats it. The hard drive is all the footage mentioned in the journal. Nothing else. I, like most of you I’m sure, am left with more questions than answers. Did something get released into our world from…elsewhere? Somewhere we can’t fully comprehend or maybe even perceive? I’ve scoured over the data in the drive doing my best to google the physics I don’t know along the way. The best I could tell was that these creatures, these… things. They were from another dimension. Somewhere in between our universe’s space and time. Another plane of existence. A dimension separate from ours, but now connected from whatever went on. 



Jack is still missing. I drove around town, went to his local coffee shops, and scoured his apartment for clues. I checked his social media. All his pages were gone. Account disabled. I was shaking. I called back his mom. She had answered excitedly as if I was the one calling with news. She sounded discouraged when I had asked the same question she had. She hadn’t gotten anything either.



I had an idea. I drove over to Jack’s apartment and parked down the block. I waited until night fell and then looked down ash the front of his building. A black van pulled up. The same style one that followed me home from the airport. It blocked my view of his apartment door but it stayed there for about ten minutes, and then left. I waited another hour after it drove off to be safe. Then I walked over to Jack’s apartment. 



I put my palm over the array of buttons, buzzing as many random numbers as I could. When one replied I pretended to drunkenly slur a sentence in the intercom that amounted to “cant… forgot keys… apartment at bar.” A few seconds and then a buzz. The door opened and I went up the stairs to Jack’s floor. I had a key to his place. I opened his door and nothing seemed out of place. I walked around, scouring for clues. After I walked by his computer setup, it booted on like it knew I was there. I looked over. 



A video queued itself up. I walked over and clicked play. It was the inside of a storage container. A light was dangling overhead and there was Jack. Chained to the floor by the ankles, sitting in a chair, tape over his mouth. A woman walked into frame. She was facing away from the camera and toward Jack. Without hesitation she unholstered a pistol and lifted it to Jack’s head. His head began to move in a panic and then it stopped. A flash and then a small spray from the back of his head. Red liquid dripped from the wound in his head onto the floor around him. 



The woman lowered the gun, holstered it, and picked up the shell casing. She was wearing all black. She walked out of frame and then a note slowly lifted in front of the camera. It read one word. “STOP” Then, the note lowered, revealing the woman’s face peering into the camera. Like she was trying to make eye contact with me. Only… she couldn’t. Here eyes were black. Her skin adorned with glowing veins. I recognized her. from the hard drive. The dive footage. The diver. Jen.
