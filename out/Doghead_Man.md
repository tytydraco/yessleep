My concerns about coming back to Greece diminished when I viewed the full moon over the mountainside.  Growing up in New York, I’ve only ever known crowded streets, garbage and skyscrapers.

I flew back to Athens to meet my friend Lyco; he lived in his family home local to the university we both attended.  I’ll never forget the day we met.

Sitting in the quad one day, two particularly creepy upperclassmen walked by me and said, “frésko ​​kréas!” then laughed as they walked away.  That’s when Lyco walked up to me.

“Ignore them, they’re just making fun because you’re new, ‘frésko ​​kréas’ just means fresh meat.” he said, holding out his hand. “I’m Lyco, nice to meet you.”

“I’m Dennis, nice to meet you too.” I replied.

Lyco helped me adjust to the regional culture and always had questions about America- a place he wanted to visit but for some reason wasn’t allowed to, which I never understood.

During senior year, I did a couple things I regretted.  Lyco lent me money before my flight back to NYC, which I promised I’d send back immediately, but neglected to when I returned to the states.  And worse, I slept with his sister, Ilissa, after a Carnival party.  I was never sure if Lyco needed to know this though; Ilissa was an adult, she even said herself it was best not to say anything.  I never saw her again after that; her strawberry blonde hair and vivid blue eyes made it hard to forget her.  I was secretly hoping I’d see those eyes again on this trip.

However, I did bring Lyco his money, with interest, and gave him my best Canon video camera as a gift.  Lyco seemed pleased, so I relaxed.  I had to bite my tongue though; I desperately wanted to know where Ilissa was.  She sent me letters over the years, the last one was a postcard that came with a warning to *not come back* *to Greece*, no matter how badly we wanted to see each other.  I begged her to come to NYC, but nothing.  We stayed off social media to not raise any suspicion.

Relaxing on the porch, Lyco and I reminisced on our college adventures.  Like when we climbed up the university’s clock tower and smoked a hash & tobacco cigarette, then being too afraid to climb down.  And that stroll along the river when I encountered the “beast”.

*At one point on the walk we separated to pee, that is when I saw it staring at me.  It was far away, but I quickly zipped up and ran back to meet Lyco.  When we reconnected, I didn’t say anything, I was in shock.*

“It looked like man with dog’s head; it walked on two legs.” Lyco recalled.

“You saw it too?!?” I exclaimed.

Lyco then recounted a story of how his grandfather fought one off in their backyard.  And tragically… Ilissa is dead, the family believes the beast killed her.  Her torso was found along the same riverbed not far from his house, but her head was missing.

My mind went into a spiral, vertigo.

“I found this necklace near where we found her body.” he said, holding up the necklace in a bloody plastic bag.  It was the same necklace I gave to Ilissa during Carnival.

Now I’m feeling sick.

All thoughts of confessing our brief affair were now moot seeing the necklace; she’s gone. 

“Ilissa deserves a proper burial, but we need to find her head.  Besides my parents, you are the only person that knows this, the police don’t even know.” he finished.

Lyco and I drove his jeep to the river, leaving the headlights on so we could look for her head.  I can’t believe I flew to Greece and am now searching for the missing head of someone I was deeply in love with.  Is this a joke?

We split up to scour the area, flashlights in hand.  It wasn’t long before I saw “it” again.  This time it howled up at the moon.

I screamed, “Lyco, let’s go, now!!”

I got to the jeep first, so I hopped into the driver’s seat.  As I kicked the door open for Lyco, the doghead man bared its teeth and lunged at the jeep.  I slammed the door shut in time and sped off down the dirt path.

Tears streaming down my face, I slammed the brakes, I had to go back and get Lyco, but in the rearview mirror the dogman was quickly approaching.  Its howl, chilling.

It grabbed onto the spare tire, ripping if off the back of the Jeep entirely.  I had no choice but to speed out of there.

Back at the house, I couldn’t figure out how to call for help, nobody was at home. 

"The police don't even know." echoed in my head, causing me to hesitate calling 911, or whatever it is out here.

Lyco then sent me a text message.

*“I’m ok, I waded across the river, the dogman hates water.  Be there soon.”*

I was relieved.  This trip to Greece has turned into unimaginable horror in just a few hours.

As I waited for Lyco, I brought my luggage into the guest room that Lyco showed me when I arrived and began to unpack to take my mind off what just happened.  In the top drawer of the dresser were some of my letters to Ilissa, unopened.  Then I noticed it, the unmistakable odor of rotting flesh.  I slowly opened the bottom drawer.  Ilissa’s rotting head rolled over, resting in place on the back of her head staring straight up at me, her once vibrant blue eyes now looked like jellied candy oozing a dark green slime.

Lyco then entered the house, slamming the door hard.  He ran up the stairs in loud stomps.

He entered the guest room holding the spare tire from his jeep.  He threw it hard against the wall, leaving a gaping hole.  His clothes were shredded.

He said, “Well Dennis, I think it’s time to inform you that you have a son.  Would you like to meet him?”

A small creature- half human, half resembling a mutant dog- came strolling around the corner on a leash, walking on two legs.  They walked over to the closet, opened the door; Ilissa’s torso came tumbling out, then the creature began to eat her flesh, starting with the arm.  Lyco held up the Canon camera to film the occasion.

“Welcome to the family, Dennis.” he said as he backed out of the room and shut the door.
