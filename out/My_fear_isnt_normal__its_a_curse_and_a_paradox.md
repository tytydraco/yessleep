*“Being afraid is perfectly natural, Russ. There’s nothing more human than fear. It’s the universe reminding you that you’re still alive, after all.”*

Dr. Buckwater would say things like that to me all the time, waxing poetic bullshit in my general direction from five to six P.M. every Tuesday evening for almost a decade. None of it worked, of course. How could it? As much as I attempted to explain it all to him, he just didn’t seem to understand.

My fear isn’t normal.

I liked my childhood therapist, don’t get me wrong. He was kind, attentive, and he tried his damndest to fix me.

At least I *thought* he was trying to fix me. After what happened last year, though, I’m not so sure anymore.

\-----

I think what sets *my* particular fear apart is its origin, or, more accurately, its complete and total lack of one.

Let me explain.

Normal fear doesn’t just appear out of nowhere; it’s born. There’s a cause and an effect. Something horrific happens, and the result is fear. You take a tumble down some stairs, and now you’re afraid of falling. Your aunt’s German Shepard bites you, and now you’re afraid of dogs.

My fear, however, never seemed to have that linkage. It just…was. It was born without a mother, the terror equivalent of immaculate conception.

I know what you're thinking: isn’t that just anxiety, then? Some generalized fear of everything and nothing at the same time?

That’s the thing, though. It wasn’t general; my fear was very specific.

Ever since I can remember, I’ve been afraid of something popping out of an enclosed space at me. It sounds insane, but it's the truth. That concept has had its hand gripped tightly around my throat since day one.

Take my first birthday party, for example. The moment my parents put a gift in front of me, which my family had wrapped for the fun it, I became inconsolable. I’m told I was wailing like a banshee, trying to run away on legs that barely had the coordination to walk at that point. My response was *so* extreme that my parents actually ended up taking me to the emergency room. They thought I may have been having a seizure or something.

The doctors checked me out, but I was completely fine. Eventually, my parents figured out the pattern.

So, by the time I could put a coherent sentence together, I was enrolled in therapy with Dr. Buckwater.

\------

*“Have you ever noticed how you talk about your fear, Russ? The vocabulary you use, I mean?”*

Twelve-year-old me shrugged, struggling through exhaustion to hold a conversation. My reputation as a crybaby made me an easy target for bullying. By the time I was in high school, each day was a mix of a nightmare and a marathon. I needed to be vigilant for threats, while simultaneously managing my unexplainable fear.

Dr. Buckwater put down his notepad and leaned forward in his chair.

*“Well, you always describe it as ‘I’m of afraid of something* ***popping out*** *at me’. Never jumping out. Never emerging. Never appearing. Whatever you’re afraid of, it’s always ‘popping out’. Why do you think that is?”*

Honestly, I found his line of questioning irritating. He knew me well by that point. I feel like he could have guessed how I was going to respond.

*“Like I’ve said before, I don’t understand why I do what I do. I don’t understand why I fear what I fear. It’s all just…a feeling. Like, I just know that ‘popped out’ are the right words. It’s the* ***only*** *words to describe it. What does it matter, anyway?”*

He leaned back, smiling.

*“I suppose you’re right. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t matter.”*

Dr. Buckwater winked at me, and then he said something that made no earthly sense.

*“Not yet, at least.”*

I always left therapy feeling a little better, but in the long run, my fear never improved. If anything, it steadily worsened, year after year, reaching a peak intensity right before the event that would make our small town national news.

\------

I developed a veritable Rolodex of bullies over the years. Honestly, there had to be at least one person who had bullied on every page of my yearbook. It was a very generous percentage of my peers, let's put it that way. I wouldn’t classify Timmy as a bully, though. That shithead was an entirely different breed. *Tormentor* is probably a more appropriate label, but even that doesn’t capture the depths of his sadism.

Although the boy was thin, he compensated for that by being tall, towering over me at a height of at least six and a half feet. Wide forehead, freckled face, beady eyes; an absolute fucking monster, prowling this earth and inflicting pain without limitations.

If it wasn’t a beating, it was him sneaking up on me with a shoebox containing a spider, popping it open on me when I least expected it. If it wasn’t a prank that targeted my fears, it was a laundry list of insults spit at me while I was walking home.

Preoccupied by a messy divorce, my parents weren’t much help. Because of that, Mr. Muller was my only source of support.

I’d known the man my whole life. He’d lived alone in a three-story house down the street for the last forty years. Never found himself a wife, never had any kids. When he retired from his job as a mechanical engineer, Mr. Muller finally pursued his real passions; toys, comics, and close-up magic tricks. His shop never seemed to get much business, but I don’t think business was the point. Unburdened by the financial strain that came with having a family, he’d accumulated a small fortune for himself to keep his shop afloat no matter how much he sold.

Made all his own toys, too. Motorized them and everything.

We had a certain kinship, Mr. Muller and I. He was an outcast, too. His eccentricities kept people at arm’s length. But he was always kind to me, day in and day out, patching up my injuries and reminding me I had value.

Despite our close relationship, I never disclosed the specific details of my fears to him. Not once. Maybe it was pride, or maybe it was something more unexplainable. It just didn't *feel* right to tell. All he knew was that I was different, like him, and that made me a target for people like Timmy.

Which made what happened next nearly impossible to explain.

\-----

One afternoon, I arrived at Mr. Muller’s, holding back hot tears from searing pain in my wrist. I had been walking home from school when Timmy rode up behind me, shouting obscenities. I didn't react, nor I did respond. All I wanted was for him to go away. He didn’t take my cold shoulder too kindly, however, knocking me to the ground and stomping on my wrist over and over again. Age did not temper his savagery. At twenty, Timmy was still the same monster he was at twelve.

It took a while, but I convinced Mr. Muller not to call the police. Timmy’s father was the sheriff, and he had already shielded his boy from many legal repercussions over the years. Needless to say, I had been that down that road before, and it only made everything worse.

He was livid, face flushed with fiery blood, but he nodded in agreement.

As I walked out, I said something that I’ll regret for the rest of my life.

*“I just wish he felt what I felt, every goddamned day. I wish he understood my fear.”*

\----

When I stopped by Mr. Muller’s a week later, he could barely contain his excitement. The man was practically bursting at the seams, explaining that he had something really important to show me.

I followed him down the basement stairs into his workshop, and there was a crate in the middle of the room. Immediately, my heart rate sky rocketed. Blood throbbed in my ears like war drums. Before I could come up with a way to excuse myself, Mr. Muller was dancing over to the crate. He sauntered around the side of it, his frame disappearing behind the large wooden box.

Then, three distinct noises filled my ears. There was a metallic twisting sound, like he was cranking a giant lever on the back of the crate that I couldn’t see from where I was standing. Next, muffled whimpers emanated from *inside* the box, making desperate pleas that I couldn't understand. Finally, Mr. Muller began singing, bellowing and hollering the words like a TV evangelist.

*“All around the cobbler’s bench*  
*The monkey chased the weasel,*  
*The monkey thought ‘twas all in fun*

*"Pop! Goes the weasel.”*

As the top of the crate swung open, fear flooded through my body, crushing me like a tidal wave collapsing on to a coastal city.

Every moment that I’d ever been afraid and every shred of terror that I’d ever felt crystalized into one singular feeling; a shimmering latticework of pain, shock, and panic forming in my skull, pure and perfect in every way.

Then, as I saw him, that latticework exploded into a million razor sharp pieces, tearing my brain to ribbons.

Timmy, bloodied and broken, popped out of the crate.

I expected him to fall forward, but he didn't. Instead, he hung in the air, blocking the ceiling light like an eclipse.

A steel pole had been fused to his spine, welded to his bones via a haphazard combination of nails, cautery and thick metallic thread. I could hear Timmy’s weathered skin ripping and tearing from the tension of his weight against gravity. Blood seeped down the pole, with new crimson liquid dripping over older brown-black stains, leaking onto a massive spring located deeper in the crate.

Mr. Muller had built every piece of it from scratch.

As my eyes meet Timmy’s, I could see it.

Wild, primal, incomprehensible fear.

\------

Months later, I’d hear Mr. Muller’s testimony. When he tried to explain *why* he kidnapped and mutilated Timmy, I couldn't help but feel a tiny spark of Déjà vu. He almost sounded like me talking to Dr. Buckwater.

*“I wanted Russ to be safe. But like I’ve mentioned before, I don’t completely understand why I hurt him like...like that. It was just…a feeling. A feeling I couldn’t ignore.”*

\------

By the time Timmy died, I had been out of therapy for almost two years. Dr. Buckwater moved out of town shortly after I stopped seeing him, and, so far, my internet search hasn’t been able to determine where he got off to.

I may never know how he was involved in this, if he even was. In spite of that, another matter weighs more heavily on my mind than Dr. Buckwater’s disappearance.

The paradox of it all.

Look at it this way: it seems like I felt the reverberations of this event all throughout my life, even though it hadn’t happened yet. It’s like the sensation of fear was so intense that it somehow echoed through me backwards, altering my consciousness since the day I was born. But in order for me to have felt those echos, Timmy had to have died. He needed to bully me to the point where Mr. Muller had a psychotic break and lashed out at him, otherwise, he never gets killed in the first place. But Timmy targeted me *because* of my fears, which shouldn't be there *unless* he was already killed...

You see what I mean? The more I think about it, the more it all collapses in on itself.

So, I wanted to ask of all of you: has anyone experienced anything like this before?

Or, maybe more importantly, does anyone know the location of a man that goes by the name *Dr. Buckwater*?
