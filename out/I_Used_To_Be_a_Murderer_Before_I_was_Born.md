Hi, my name is Isaiah Hunt. And this is my confession. I am three months old and am married to a beautiful wife and have two beautiful children. A boy, a girl, and one on the way that we don’t know the gender yet. I’ve been a County Sheriff for a year and have been on the force for 7. I also, as the title says, murdered several people. I don’t remember everything yet. But, I can’t live with this information in my head and not give their families the closure they deserve to have it’s the least we could do- the least I could do.

In 2018 I went into law enforcement. I won’t bore you all with the needless details but in short I did fairly well for my first year. There was a hostage situation where a woman was being held by her tenant and I took the shot that ended up saving the lady. Do not mistake this as me making up excuses or even as a hero, I’m just telling what I’ve done; factual information. I didn’t necessarily rise through the ranks, but I did well enough that after three years into law enforcement, I was on the S.W.A.T. team. I was a good shot, I actually signed up for military in highschool but they wouldn’t take me in on account of a family history of diabetes, fair enough. But eventually I was the guy that was called out to be one of the few snipers they call out for rare circumstances that, well, need a damn good shot and dead body.

I liked it, the job. But I didn’t get called out enough to satisfy myself. It wasn’t enough for me so I had asked the right people to take me off as the sniper, and back on as SWAT. Even if they don’t get called out much, I had better odds at getting called out and have a chance at putting a hole through somebody than a sniper. Plus, you get more protective gear as a SWAT guy than a cop.

It was on one of those SWAT calls that I got shot with a shotgun from a good enough distance that it just peppered me a bit on my shoulders, and I met my wife at the hospital because I still had to have a pellet or two tweezered out. Long story short me and her got married just shy of a year later. It was a good wedding and nine months after that we had my lil daisy, and a lil more than a year after her, my boy junior. That was the night I killed my first, my first real kill. I had been away taking care of my wife so long that the only thing I had killed legitimately in the course of two years was her cat that got the mange and the occasional spider. It was a meth head under a bridge, I studied him for a month and a half. He didn’t live with a camp of the homeless. He lived behind a bowling alley in Athens which is just a town or two over from here in Cleveland. Maybe a 30 minute drive if traffic ain’t bad from where I lived. I don’t want to go into detail on how he was killed or how we— I killed him but I did it that night. I did. It with his own pocket knife. I apologize for not knowing his name but if you live in Athens, TN and you know the man I killed— I’m sorry that we killed him and I’ll make sure we pay.

I moved to Memphis that same year. It was a prime hunting ground for him. And apparently there’s a lot more people in Memphis that “no one cares about” according to him- me- us. I killed around 6 people then. Nine millimeter, we even bought a Glock 19 so that if the gun powder residue was ever traced back to type of gun that was used to shoot it, it’d be the same gun that most gangbangers try to use that put those illegal switches on theirs for full auto. Police use nine millimeter two but my office at the time used .357 Glock 31s. I’m sorry again I don’t remember what the dates are, I don’t know much except I lured these teens at night over to my car off duty as cop and would take them under a bridge and, I don’t wanna go into detail. I know two of their names they were John and Linda. And to their families- I’m sorry that we killed him and I’ll make sure we pay.

The last one I killed was the day I was diagnosed with brain cancer, about a year and a half ago. I went to Athens again, this time to the other side of town where the veteran memorial is, I found nearest homeless man, did the cop routine took him under the bridge and I water boarded him to death underneath it where the stream runs along the road next to the memorial. I searched his wallet, I know his last name was Wallace. And again to his family- I’m sorry that we killed him and I’ll make sure we pay.

My wife at this time had a girlfriend from college who dealt with some kind of new treatment or something for cancer patients, but not cancer. Im sorry, i know im rushing this confession but i have to hurry this a bit up i already hear the sirens. Anyway, she had went to Harvard and went to highschool with my wife and i didnt really want to do chemo, my dad went that way and im pretty sure he would’ve lived a bit longer than just the 2 months after being diagnosed and goin’ thru with it.

I don’t think i ever caught her name sense i could hear behind the glass, but she started this program taking cancer patients and other terminally ill people and doing very small skin graphs and turn them into this slurry in a tube. Small enough graphs that it was about like picking off a papercut scab after it had been healed. Minuscule. That’s why it took about 6months for me to grow my eyes and finally see myself for the first time, outside on the other side of my tube. I’d see him return a few times but I assume he died soon after that because they came in with a big black bag the size of themselves and they blended its remains into my tube. It didn’t take long after that I gre arms, legs, feet, my penis. All the essentials.

The memories came later, in dreams no less. It took a month for them to start making sense but they were vivid I can remember them. It’s so hard to believe it’s not me but it’s me. I’m both the Crack Killer off the news and not. I’m a reflection of man who deserved to be tortured for the evil things he’s done. I couldn’t believe it at first, but when I looked into my box of things I left me, I saw the Swiss Army Knife and figured out why I had a second gun at home that my wife didn’t remember us having. And to everyone he’s- WE’VE hurt -I’m sorry that we killed him and I’ll make sure we pay.

I see the sirens, wife’s took the kids out to watch some movie about an assassin named after a candle. Don’t think my daisy will like it but I know junior will. I’ve got both my glocks. I called them in myself, so don’t worry no one else is gonna get hurt, they’re empty and the police don’t know that. They think I’ve got a loaded weapon. I think it’s better to let the man he was— I mean the man we are get killed on TV. At least maybe the families can get some kind of satisfaction. We deserve worse but I won’t serve a sentence for him. This is worse, he wanted to hurt people and never got hurt, had all the safety in the world while they were unarmed and unprotected. This’ll hurt both what reputation he didn’t earn AND his stupid damn ego. And I’ll be damned if we die without knowing how much pain we’ve caused.

So this is it, don’t cry for me. We don’t deserve it. And as for Elizabeth, Daisy and Junior, I’m sorry I killed me but he must pay.
