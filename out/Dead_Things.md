What do you know of dead things? Truly know? They are dead, right? Life drained and body rotted, soul whisked to a far place, it seems irreversible. It seems, irreversible. And you, dear reader, must surely know that not all is as it seems, at least I do, and it’s my experience that I will be detailing. I will not disclose the ritual to do this, it’s a dark thing that must not be repeated, unless hell on earth sounds particularly interesting to your particular tastes.

I had gone to the grocery store on Thursday, a local Walmart of my hometown in the American Midwest. Officially it was routine, my mother, heartbroken with the recent death of my dear father, had sent me to do it on her behalf. Unofficially, it was much more than a mere grocery run. I was also grieving at the loss of my father, and my mother’s ache hurt me more than I ever admitted. I got the usuals, bread, meats, milk, eggs, all those common things. I also picked up red candles, chicken hearts, and one more ingredient. A common yet secretly potent one for my plans, I shall not divulge its name for fear of all souls on Earth and yonder. 

My mother had given me her card for the groceries, yet I put the uniquer items on my own, caution would be paramount in the following days. Before you wonder, this ritual involves no exhuming of corpses, no macabre chants, and no lingering taint on the individual soul. On my ride home, I was sure to speak to the butcher, a man who my father knew well, and of him I requested a liter of animal blood. The excuse I gave him (besides the power of currency of course) was the making of a fine broth for a wonderful soup. It was not that I doubted the effectiveness of the chicken hearts, it was a simple precaution. The remainder of the ride went without event, although I could have sworn I had been made aware of a presence, multiple presences, watching my actions with unknowable interest. I could not place these spirits, and I was sure no amount of time, and no amount of patience could. I was lacking both.

Eventually I had returned to my mother’s residence, a quaint, pretty little home nestled in the communities heart. The sun was dipping beyond the horizon, its warmth I would not ever feel again as I entered the door. The ritual does not require darkness, but its presence reinforces emotional response, which, I may add, ate crucial to the success of the action. The dead crave attention. I briefly stopped by the couch, to rest my hand on my grieving mother to comfort. She gave no response, her eyes distant and grey hair dropping over the pale skin of her head. As a boy I had thought her indomitable, unrelenting. At that moment I craved no more than to return to that childlike innocence. I gathered the used tissues she had wept into, disposing of them and bringing her another box. It was then I unloaded the groceries she had requested into her fridge.

Upon my return to the living room, I was making my way to the basement to prepare the ritual, I noticed the absence of my mother. She was old, and it showed, I found it surprising she had crept with such haste. I came to her standing by the basement door, her body turned toward it and her hand resting gently against its aged surface. I made to guide her frail form back to the couch, but I was held by what I could only describe as insects chittering, and her body began to shake. I had expected this, although I had wished dearly for it not to happen. I took the liter of animal blood from my bag. Using my teeth I tore a hole, and hastily attempted to douse my mother with it. I’ve found death does not appreciate attempts to steal souls from his gluttonous hands. 

My mother, nimble with an ability that I’d not seen from her, dove from my path, twisted and puppet like. Turning to reveal her ravaged maw bared in bony spikes as she leapt towards me. It would be the summit of hubris to say I did not feel the delightful chill of fear sew its thread through my skin. Panicking, I threw the blood at her vicious maw, inches from my calf as it hit her, she had already bit deep, and I felt the cold of the wound, the mark of death. The blood turned her attention, and she convulsed as she bashed her head against the floor where it had splattered, her skull lasted not three strikes before it was unworthy of the name “skull”. Distraught and afraid, I lunged towards the door, flinging it open and practically diving down the stairs.

In my haste, I slowly remembered along with a fresh rush of irritation and primal panic, it had eluded me to seal the entrance. I shot up the stairs, able to seal it right as the devil thing had finished abusing its unwilling host. It violently crashed against the door, again and again, and I feared that it would give, but it held. Items clasped in hand, I strode down the steps, creaking and untended, into the dim basement. I felt guilt, for surely my mother was dead, but surely I could revive her alongside my father, and surely all would be forgiven. 

I walked into the room, its walls bared and unfinished, boxes stacked to the walls, reminiscent of a labyrinth from legend. I had never liked basements in my youth, always insisting on another to accompany me in my ventures. Only I was quite sure that the only living(?) thing in the house would be less than able to grant good company. I spilled my items upon the stone floor, the candles, the chicken hearts, and the ingredient. I placed the candles in a small triangle, lining them with the chicken hearts, I placed the ingredient in the middle. Somehow within me I knew this to be the way, the ritual had come to me, not I to it. It was by nature that I followed its instructions, as if I always knew how. 

I kneeled before the items, pondering that which I knew of dead things. The stench, the feel of cold flesh, the clouded eyes, the inevitable process of decay and return to the earth. I then heard the crashes against the door, once so constant I was ignorant to them, subside, as if the devil-thing had ceased. Unease crept within, there’s safety in knowing the location of one’s foe, but I steeled my mind and continued to ponder. My eyes were closed, yet tears leaked through to patter against the floor. Grief filled me, grief for my mother, my father, and their souls. It was not until I felt the heat of the candle upon my face that I opened my eyes to view the flames that had flickered into existence. The heat was that of hell, and its warmth gave no comfort, merely scorching where it fell. I felt my skin burning and knew I had to continue.

I grabbed the ingredient and hovered it above each flame, and three times it caught alight. My skin was welting now, the agony unbearable I nearly submitted to hellfire. But again I kept my straying focus and witnessed the ingredient burn in my hand. It was then that I was made aware of a putrid stench through the heat, of rotting flesh, of pained moans. The veil that had blinded me, so carefully maintained by an evil force, lifted and at last I knew the error of my ways. For my heart had admitted the devil, and was forfeit to his minions. In horror I stumbled back, my skin was melting and my eyes boiled, but the devils grabbed hold of me and ripped me back. They feasted like vultures, beaks tearing me apart. I was denied the chance to die as the weight of my actions closed upon me, it was by my hand my father fell, by my knife, my mother dead. As the ground beneath me crumbled and I fell into hell, embraced by the dark beings, still gorging themselves, I only thought of how this ritual must never be repeated. In my heart I know I along with the innumerable sinners shall one day be liberated and forgiven, but that day is far, and now I write this, hoping that the birds shall bring tidings of my doom to the world. For a doorway has opened, and another must never open or the world is doomed.

And we all are dead things.
