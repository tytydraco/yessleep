### **My classmate Mauricio got an 11/100 in orchestra class… and I don’t think it was just a bad grade.**

Okay, so I know an 11/100 sounds funny. Trust me, we *all* laughed when our conductor Mr. Harlow read the scores aloud like it was some kind of public execution.

But Mauricio didn’t laugh.
He just stared at his music stand like he was waiting for something to crawl out of it.

### **The First Weird Thing**

See, Mauricio wasn’t *bad* at violin. Not good, but not “11%” bad. He could at least hold the bow the right way, which already puts him in the top 60% of freshman orchestra.

But after that grade, everything changed. He stopped talking, stopped tuning, stopped *blinking* sometimes.

Whenever we played, he’d draw his bow across the strings so slowly the hairs barely made a sound. It was like he was listening for something *inside* the violin, not the notes we were playing.

I asked him if he was okay.
He said:

> “I’m trying… to get the score back.”

I laughed. Then he clarified:

> “Not the grade. The **score**. The one I didn’t play right.”

I had no idea what that meant.

### **The Second Weird Thing**

Mr. Harlow handed back our sheet music for the winter concert: something boring, a watered-down arrangement of *In the Hall of the Mountain King*. Everyone got the same packet—same title, same notes, same corny clip-art of a troll at the bottom.

But Mauricio’s packet wasn’t the same.

His cover page wasn’t printed in black ink.
It was this sickly brownish red.
And the title wasn’t *In the Hall of the Mountain King.*

It said:

### **“Requiem for the One Who Failed.”**

I tried to grab it, thinking maybe he’d just spilled something on it, but he held it to his chest and whispered, “Don’t. It’s not for you.”

The weird part?
Every time I blinked, the title looked *different*, like the letters rearranged themselves the moment my eyes closed.

### **Rehearsal #3**

During rehearsal, Mauricio didn’t follow the class music. He followed *his.* His bow moved in impossible patterns, double-stops that weren’t humanly playable, harmonics that should’ve screeched but instead rang crystal-clear.

At one point, everything got cold.
Not “school AC” cold—like cellar-in-a-horror-movie cold.

Our whole section stopped playing.
But *Mauricio didn’t.*

He kept sawing away, faster and faster, until the strings started to fray. I swear I saw one snap, but it kept vibrating like it was still there.

His eyes rolled up into his skull.
His mouth hung open like he was screaming silently.

Mr. Harlow finally shouted his name.
Mauricio froze.

Then the lights went out.

When they flickered back on, Mauricio was sitting normally, violin tucked under his chin, staring at the conductor with this tiny, polite smile.

Like nothing had happened.

### **The Day After**

Mauricio didn’t come to school.

We figured he was suspended for freaking out. But during last period, the office announced a lockdown. Something about “a disturbance in the music wing.”

We all heard it, though:

A violin.
Playing alone.
Fast as hell.
Wrong as hell.
Notes that slid upward in ways no fingerboard allows.

Someone said it wasn’t one violin.
It was *hundreds.*

### **Final Weird Thing (I hope)**

Today, when I checked the grade portal, everyone’s orchestra grade looked normal… except mine.

Where it should’ve said **92/100**, it now says:

### **11/100**

And beneath it, in tiny red text:

### **“Your performance has been selected.”**

There’s a new file uploaded under “Sheet Music – Required.”
The file name is:

**Requiem_for_the_Second_Failure.pdf**

I haven’t opened it yet.

I don’t think I want to.
