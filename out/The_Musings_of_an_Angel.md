It is nothing short of a miracle. That when men can hear the musings of an angel, yet still walk away. I heard her for the first time telling me, “hey stranger,” from behind. Tugging at my shirt in a lowly bar at the East side of town. 

“Why don’t you buy me a drink?”

I was never one to be chivalrous. It was something in her eyes that told me to oblige in her request though. Those sly glinty charcoal pieces, and mischievous lips. Ignoring this angel could be my downfall, I thought. Something that struck me as strange as I never once regretted putting down such a risky offer. To buy a stranger's attention never settles right within the gut. It tosses in my brain and puts me in the mood of a salesman, trying to offer something nobody would like. I was never good at selling, let alone selling myself. 

With a stranger so beautiful standing in front of me, I wanted to give it a shot. It was worth the measly five dollar gamble. It felt like I had to suck it up and knock on that door despite whatever could be on the other side. Even if it were to be the sweet nothings of a casual conversation filled with empty platitudes, it was worth the extra time I could lay my eyes on her. To imprint her visage into memory. The little cocktail dress and jet black hair. All her curves.

I waved for the tender and asked the stranger what she liked. Patting on an old stuffy barstool to my right, pulling it out for her to sit. She smiled at this. 

“Such a gentleman,” she said. 

I must admit I wasn’t in the best mood. So, I didn’t quite catch if she meant this wryly or was being forthcoming in her judgment of me. I very well could have looked like a grump when offering her the chair. My mind was a mess and when you swim in the dark pools of misery, the water tends to get in your eyes and ears. 

She scooted toward the bar table and acknowledged the tender. “Whisky sour, please.”

I raised an eyebrow and nodded at her choice. She read my face, squinting her eyes. 

“You disapprove?”

“No, it’s just not typical.”

“Not typical? You mean for a woman?” 

“Well, just in general.”

I ordered a house beer and closed the tab, joking that the whisky has bad mojo, telling her the story of how my friend drank a bottle’s worth from the place. He ended up in Tijuana with a new tattoo before he woke up, and an ex-girlfriend he couldn’t remember. She gave a hearty laugh and brushed my shoulder, but still saw straight through me. 

“I knew what you meant,” she said.

I did mean that women typically don’t drink the brown stuff, but left it at that. Not the best way to strike a flirty conversation when they think you might be a misogynist. I envisioned my five dollar bill going through a shredder, and this gorgeous woman crossing her arms in front of it in displeasure. I still wanted to see the encounter to its proper end though. 

I asked for her name and she responded “Sylvia”. Smooth as silk, low toned and hypnotic. I stuttered giving her my own, blaming the beer. She laughed. 

We talked for a good while, exchanging the typical ice breakers. Job, city you’re from, hobbies, pets, and the dreaded family. She was sweet, seemingly genuinely interested. I couldn’t believe it. Looking back at it, I didn’t get to know much about her at all. I would ask her all the normal questions, but she would slip out of them like a boxer. I didn’t even notice it. 

“Where are you from?” I would ask. 

She would look up at me like a puppy. “Nowhere near. I’m only here for a day.”

I took these empty responses at the time as her not enjoying my company, but was quickly proven wrong when she continued to ask more and more about me. It is only when I returned any personal questions back she would bounce them off. Anything else was fair play. My inebriation told me that a strange woman so close at this hour of the night surely wanted more than conversation. I made advances and she reciprocated. 

At the time, I thought I just got too comfortable. The bar was beginning to get crowded. Under the obscurity of low light and loud music, I could feel the shroud of anonymity warmly wrapping me up like a blanket. I felt no one would care if I spilled my guts out. I felt she wouldn’t mind. She was pulling me deeper, deeper into her grasp so my guts did spill. I told her about my dead brother. I told her about his funeral the other day. I teared up, and one wetted my cheek. Glistening in the low light. I looked to this stranger for reassurance, and found none. 

She was disgusted. 

Rolling her eyes, she unlinked from my arms and pushed away. In that loud room, I swore I heard her sigh “the sad ones *taste* terrible.” 

But, I didn’t think anything of it. A misread of the lips. When she left, I actually felt better. I was at ease, knowing that I was right all along nothing would come from that woman. As a teenager, I would envision whole lives together with strangers I barely knew. Sometimes they would too, and a burning passion would ensue. A love too hot for our underdeveloped minds to handle, and so our brains melted like wax and the relationships ended. I longed for that kind of attachment again. A hopeless romantic, I know. Now, it feels like the same routine over and over. Dating became a joke somewhere along the way.  

I was thinking of all this on my walk home from that bar. Shuffling on uneven cement, trying my best to not think about my brother. That’s when I tripped. 

The sting of concrete was numbed by all the liquor I drank. In my stupor, I must have missed a crack in the sidewalk. Stupid. I layed there for a minute trying to get my bearings straight as the world spun around me. I kept my vision fixated on an alley dumpster to stop the spinning. But, something was wrong. 

A lump just behind the dumpster was rising and falling. Breathing heavily. The sounds of crunching and gnawing echoed down the dark alley. I thought it was a raccoon, and wanted to investigate. 

I got closer to the feasting, and the wet sounds grew louder. A squelching, rhythmic beat like kneading raw meat underwater. There was a narrow gap between the dumpster and the crumbling brick wall, just wide enough to see what was happening.

It was a woman, crouching over someone. It was Sylvia. Her hair was undone, hanging in ropes over another man lying beneath her. His hands twitched, fingers curling like he was reaching for something invisible, but the rest of him wasn’t moving. 

She was eating away at his throat. Tearing it open in strings of deep red confetti spraying blood all over. Her jaw unhinged every time she opened it, becoming a gaping hole filled with crimson teeth, then snapping back on her victims chest. The impact cracked it open, and his belly deflated as she sucked out his insides. I could hear the gurgles and pops of organs and fluids being syphoned like a leech. Every few seconds, she’d pause to breathe air again, panting like a starving dog. 

I didn’t realize I made a noise until she stopped.

Her head snapped up. Her eyes found me instantly. She stood up slowly, blood running in rivulets down her body. Her jaw still unhinged, twitching as it worked itself back into place. Drenched in all that blood, she looked me over as if finally recognizing who I was, and was revolted to see me. 

“Ugh, you’re the miserable one.”

One second she was there, I blinked, and she was gone. The man’s body was a deflated mess resembling road kill. I could have rolled him up like a carpet, and not a single drop of blood would have been squeezed out of him. 

I didn’t sleep that night, and haven’t got much rest ever since. Be careful if you meet a gorgeous woman on a night out. She may just be a man eater.
