[\[Part 32\]](https://www.reddit.com/user/RandomAppalachian468/comments/1iob3w6/the_call_of_the_breach_part_32/)

I sat leaning against the narrow bulletproof window, staring out at the road as our ASV idled, the rest of the convoy doing the same. Radio chatter flickered back and forth across the headsets, but I barely paid any attention to it. Heavier snowflakes tumbled all around us now, the outside world turning white in a slow march of winter’s vanguard. The interior of our armored car was warm, the heaters blasting, but I couldn’t stop a chill from running down my spine. Our vehicles were lining up for the descent, waiting on a few stragglers to catch up so we could all go in together. Within their steel charges, the troops checked their weapons one last time while the gunners kept their eyes peeled for anything suspicious. So far, we’d seen nothing, no beast or intelligent life, yet I knew they were out there. Vecitorak had invited me here, he knew I was coming; there had to be a thousand eyes on us at this very moment.

*So why not attack us now? Why let us just walk right in? He’s not stupid, which means this is deliberate, it has to be.*

“Solid copy, Stalker Two Four, roll your heavies up front, and we’ll wait for the last vic to begin the descent. Rhino One Actual, out.” Chris released the talk button on his radio mic and turned to look at me from the driver’s seat. “We’ve got about three minutes until the plunge. See anything?”

Shivering despite the thick coat over my shoulders, I looked down at my palm, where the silver and turquoise necklace rested. “Nothing.”

I didn’t have to look his way to feel Chris’s eyes on me. “They’re going to put the Abrams up front, to punch a hole for us. Unless the freaks find a bunch of Javelins somewhere, they won’t be able to stop them. We should be able to drive right up to the objective.”

Returning his words with a silent nod, I frowned at the jewelry in my grasp and drowned myself in thought. My ‘plan’ if it could be called that, was simple; should we reach the tower, I would try to climb to the top, as per Madison’s account. There I would hopefully find the sacrifice room, where all those who came before us left their trinkets as payment for the eldritch powers that held the void together, and I would place the necklace where it belonged. I still had no idea what that would do, if anything. I couldn’t know for sure that Madison was alive, or even in a survivable state if so. My dreams had shown a nightmare of flesh melded with void-life, and even with the best of ELSAR’s medical tech, I had a feeling such bizarre mutation couldn’t be undone. Vecitorak himself was bound to the mysterious book, but something told me stopping him wouldn’t be as simple as burning, shooting, or stabbing the fetid thing. After all, I’d torn out a page, and he didn’t seem to notice. No, if the book was an extension of him, then it would require a special action to destroy, and part of my desperately hoped I could figure that out somewhere between the entrance and the tower. Of course, none of this mattered if we couldn’t stop the Oak Walker resurrection, and I had zero ideas for that. It felt like walking into a final exam with nothing save for a stubby pencil and a vague concept of the subject material to guide me.

A finger tapped on my shoulder, and I swiveled my head to see Jamie, her facial scarf discarded since it was only the four of us in our vehicle, point to her radio headset as she leaned down from the 90mm gun turret. “Channel two.”

I clicked the switch on my radio to go to our private channel and squinted out the thick glass of my viewing port in the same fashion as she looked down the gunsight. “You ready for this?”

*“Ready as I’ll ever be.”* She sighed through the mic, the subtle electric whine of the gun turret rotating in the background as Jamie scanned for targets. *“At least these things will be harder to peel open than our old war machines. Think we brought enough ammo?”*

I bit my lower lip at the nightmarish idea of running out and swallowed hard. “Probably not.”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Peter’s grimace in the rear compartment behind Chris as he overheard that last remark, his musings no doubt similar to my own. He knew what was out there, he’d faced it the same as I had. Tanks or no tanks, Vecitorak wouldn’t make this easy on us.

*“Maybe we could just park off the road and shell the crap out of them?”* Jamie offered. *“I mean, between the ELSAR boys and our guns, we’ve got enough firepower to bring down a building. Surely the mold-king wouldn’t survive that.”*

“You’d be surprised.” I glowered at the long shadows between the trees, confident they were grinning back at me. No matter how hard I tried, my mind continued to go back to Madison’s account of this cursed place. She hadn’t known that night when she ran headlong into the storm that this wasn’t a normal part of our world. The poor girl had no clue what she was about to do, and I felt a small twinge of pity in my chest as I fidgeted in the green foam seat cushion.

*She only wanted to help . . . and here I am, thinking the same. Am I just as much the naïve fool? Is this a lost cause?*

In one of the wide-angled mirrors positioned on the fenders of the squat armored vehicle, I glimpsed Adam wriggle his upper body out the turret of his vehicle to affix a flag atop it. Icy wind pulled the cloth taut to reveal a white flag with a golden cross on a red background, the symbol of Ark River’s faith. Eve’s wounded pleas for her husband not to leave her behind resurfaced in my brain, and I shut my eyes for a moment to block them out.

“So, that’s the abyss then?” Peter appeared at my elbow, silver flask in hand, dark eyes on the viewing port to get a glimpse of the Breach.

With a short nod, I hefted my Type 9 in my hands, and eyed the stampings on its receiver, remembering the first day I’d held it.

Peter’s face contorted with a blend of unease and attempted indifference that fell rather short of its goal. “Doesn’t look like much.”

*The worst things never do.*

At my silence, he extended his arm to offer me the stainless-steel flask.

I hesitated, and reached out to take the container, pressing it to my lips. The contents burned down the back of my throat enough to make me cough, but I forced a few swallows down anyway and handed it back to Peter. “T-Thanks.”

“I’d say it’ll put hair on yer chest, but you ladies tend to look better furless.” Wearing a half-grin at my obvious inexperience with such hard liquor, Peter looked down at his drink, then back at the inky forest. “Tarren’s in there?”

With a few more hard coughs to clear my throat, I dug my canteen from my belt to wash some of the foul taste away. “Wherever Vecitorak is, she is also. There’s going to be a lot of freaks between us and him, though. What we’re looking at is just the veil; on the other side is the *real* Tauerpin Road, and there could be a few thousand Puppets waiting for us in the first half mile alone.”

Peter winced but drained the last of his flask and tossed it under one of the rear seats. “Just as well. I’m out of grog. Might as well die before the shakes set in.”

*“Last vehicle is in position.”* Colonel Riken’s voice came through the headset slung low around Peter’s neck, and the former pirate went back to his seat.

Chris and I exchanged a glance as he put the ASV into gear, and I switched my radio back to the main channel.

In front of us, a line of four M1 main battle tanks rumbled onto the gravel road, and I slipped Madison’s necklace over my head as we followed them in. My eyes caught the flash of color from Adam’s flag in one of our fender mirrors, and I gripped my submachine gun tight to my chest.

*God . . . Adonai, I know we haven’t always been on good terms, and we don’t talk that much, but if the others could make it out of this, I’d appreciate it.*

As soon as the front tire of our ASV touched the edge of Tauerpin Road, my ears began to hum, static filled my head, and I fought to draw a breath as my lungs seemed to collapse on themselves. The world tilted, my vision blurred, and even the pulse in my temple slowed. I tasted mud, blood, and stagnant water between my teeth. It was as if some heavy weight dragged me down beneath a black pool of silence, and my fear rose in an attempt to drown me.

*‘You don’t understand.’*

A dark, inhuman chorus of eerie voices wriggled through my mind like worms in a corpse, foul and shrieking.

*‘You’ll ruin everything.’*

My head sagged, I thrashed inside my own mind to try and stay conscious, but it felt like a thousand hands were pulling me down into the mire of static.

*‘We can save you.’*

Too many. There were too many voices, I couldn’t fight them all. The whispers were loud, the blackness all-consuming, and I felt my mind growing weaker by the second.

*‘Don’t listen to them!’*

Something touched the inside of my palm, cold and smooth. A girl’s voice, familiar if distant, rang through my consciousness in a desperate plea, and as my fingers closed down around the object, a bolt of white lightning cut through the static. Whatever had taken hold of me seemed to release its grasp, and I swam back to the surface of my consciousness with fervent thrashes.

“Hannah?”

My head shot upright, and I gulped down air.

Chris and Peter watched me with alarmed confusion as our armored car rolled slowly forward, following the clattering tanks down the long roadway. On the thick bulletproof glass, the snow had been replaced by pattering rain, the darkness around us blanketed by shadow instead of white snow. Gravel crunched under the tires of the convoy, and thunder rumbled in the oily black storm clouds overhead. I had slumped against the door, the Type 9 hanging by its sling at my side. My one hand was clenched tight around the turquoise stone of Madison’s necklace on my chest, the only part of me that hadn’t gone limp.

Chris’s worried blue eyes locked on mine. “Tell me you’re okay.”

Shaking like one of the many leaves outside that blew in this dimension of perpetual late-autumn, I pawed for my canteen and guzzled half of it. “I’m good. Just got lightheaded there for a second. Did the others get through?”

Peter loosened his collar and moved back to his seat. “So far, so good. It’s warmer here, maybe upper 40’s to low 50’s. Looks like we won’t be slogging through the snow after all.”

“No, just ankle-deep mud.” Jamie called down from her turret as she panned the main gun from side to side.

Sitting up in my seat, I rubbed my eyes and stared out the window in macabre fascination. It was surreal being here, after seeing it so many times in my mind. A strange part of me yearned to step outside, to feel the gravel under my bare feet, let the rain soak me from head to toe, and taste the cold wind on my lips. It was a primal sensation, an alien magnetism that frightened me, and I frowned as we went, doing my best to push the memory of the ethereal voices from my head.

*Focus, Hannah. You have to find the old tower. The sooner you find it, the sooner you can leave.*

Led by the mighty Abrams with their caterpillar tracks, the hefty military vehicles easily surmounted any fallen limbs or potholes in the roadway, trundling through the dark with their headlights on. Our lead tank even had a bulldozer blade affixed to it and made quick work of anything larger than a molehill. Spotlights mounted to the armored turrets pierced the dark, bright and foreign in this dripping, bleak abyss. Thanks to the fact that we drove ELSAR-made vehicles, none of our gunners so much as got their heads wet as they were completely enclosed by armor, and the heaters didn’t have to struggle to warm the steel interiors with how much the temperature had changed outside. In fact, with the rain drumming on the metal over my head, the dull rumble of the diesels, and the slow gentleness of the flat, straight road, the drive proved somewhat comfortable. It reminded me of riding in my dad’s SUV back in Louisville, of the long trips we made to visit family in Florida, of falling asleep in the back while he and mom rode up front. How I longed to be that secure again, to drift off without a care in the world, trusting that no danger lay outside.

A flash of movement caught my eye in the trees, and I went rigid. “Get ready.”

*Whump.*

An enormous maple tree collapsed into the road ahead of our lead tank, and the forest burst to life.

In a great screeching wave, Puppets swarmed from every direction, some mounted atop beasts of the void, others on foot, howling at the top of their fetid lungs. Arrows and spears clanged off the sides of our vehicles, arching in great clouds into the black sky to hurtle down at speed. Those armed with hand weapons threw themselves at our convoy, their dirty chipped nails clawing at our windows, fists pounding on our armor, striking at our windshields, headlights, and tires with fury. Many struck with whatever clubs, spears, axes, or crude blades they had until their implements broke, and the beasts they rode did their best to turn the trucks over with great roars of hatred. Most were Birch Crawlers, but I did spot a few other creatures that I didn’t recognize, more denizens of the Breach that had yet to manifest in large numbers within Barron County. As they had the night Vecitorak had stabbed me, the army of mutants surrounded and pummeled our convoy with the hopes of ruining our lights to bring us to a stop and leave us vulnerable to their leader’s psychic manipulation. Perhaps they believed we would come with the rag-tag vehicles they’d seen us use in the drive on Black Oak.

They were wrong.

As more trees were dropped across the road, the bulldozer tank at the front pushed them aside like toy cars, and the hefty iron tracks of the behemoth crushed Puppets into a pulp as it rolled forward. Our gunners, safe inside their turrets, let loose a hailstorm of lead upon the enemy, and cut them down in droves. Machine guns reaped a deadly harvest, the automatic grenade launchers ripped apart the trees as more enemy tried to advance under their cover, and the 90mm main guns of our ASV’s sent geysers of earth into the sky as they punched holes in the Puppet line. The main battle tanks brought their formidable 120mm cannon to bear, and the ground shook under our tires as the guns belched clouds of smoke into the night. Onward we drove, pushing through the hordes as our drivers cursed under their breath, the gunners called for more ammo from the crews inside their vehicles, and the infantry inside the armored personal carriers shot from gun ports. It was a hell of lightning, muzzle flashes, and shadow, but still, we advanced, and within my own besieged vehicle, I felt my hope rise.

*We’re doing it. Holy cow, we’re really doing it. They’re dying in droves out there, we can do this!*

“Any idea how close we are?” Chris gripped his steering wheel, teeth clenched as we bumped over a growing tide of gray skinned bodies, the crunching of wooden corpses audible in spite of the unending gunfire.

I squinted as much as my enhanced vision would allow, heart pounding as I tried to peer through the morass of eerie faces that clawed at my window outside, their bone-tipped hacking at the armored glass to no avail. Everything looked the same, the road flanked on either side by trees, the occasional muddy embankment, and overgrown ditches filled with rainwater. Our headlights and the flashes of gunfire lit up the darkness in a shutter-stop parade, but I still couldn’t see very far ahead, especially not when the enemy ranks continued to throw themselves at us with total disregard for their lives.

Something glinted in the beam of the lead tank’s spotlight, and my heart skipped a beat.

Yellow.

Cobalt yellow.

The color of a chemical suit.

Just behind the vague gold-colored outline, I caught a break in the trees, the rise of a small grassy embankment, and felt a jolt in my heart as a flood of emotions washed over me.

*Hang in there, Maddie, Tarren; we’re coming.*

Fumbling for my radio mic button, I shouted above the din as our convoy rolled along. “Lead vic, this is Sparrow One Actual; veer left! You’re right on top of the objective, veer left, *left!* Make a road into that clearing.”

*“Copy that.”* The gruff voice of none other than Colonel Riken crackled through the speakers as the Abrams swerved left to plow its enormous bulldozer blade into the grassy embankment. *“All units, prepare to depart the MSR. We are approaching the first objective. Stay frosty and watch for crossfire. Primarch, out.”*

I craned my head to look for another sign of the stranger, but could see anything else, the blur of color gone as fast as it had come. Had I imagined it? No, I couldn’t have, not in a place like this. He was here, something deep in my gut told me it was so. That knowledge filled me with a blazing sense of resolve, and I flexed my fingers on the Type 9 to brace for the next part of our plan.

Bursting through the mud bank with a triumphant groan of its steel tracks, Riken’s bulldozer tank clattered onto the marshy plain, followed by the rest of our convoy that fanned out into an attack formation. Puppets and their beasts harassed us every step of the way, but their strikes bounced harmlessly off our armor. The storm raged above, seething like the mutants did as we broke into a faster gear, throwing mud up behind every tire or track. The prize lay dead ahead, tall and morose in the flashes of vengeful lightning, bathed in the rain of an unending torrent.

My eyes focused on the building, the golden irises I’d inherited from the mutation picking out every detail under the eerie glow of green, orange, and yellow lightning. There it was, the old coal tower, battered and leaning on its foundations with a myriad of roots snaked up the cement walls. To one side, the monstrous form lay slumped in the uncertain grip of death, its massive arms and legs ensnared with growth, the triangular-shaped head crowned with twigs. So many times I’d seen it in my nightmares, in Puppet markings, or in the few drawings left behind by the old guard of New Wilderness, but for the first time in my life I truly looked upon the Oak Walker itself.

*Wham.*

One of the tanks in front of us was thrown into the air, spinning like a top until it met the distant tree line of the clearing, and smashed them like toothpicks.

Bone-chilling roars echoed from the sky above, and two gargantuan shadows dove out of the storm. Hook-like claws gleamed in the lightning, long club shaped tails flowed in the wind behind them, and their skin looked like interwoven bark. Massive leathery wings sliced through the air effortlessly, the predators big enough to crush a three-story building with their weight. Every ounce of confidence I had left me, and I shrunk back in my seat at the monsters that flung themselves down from the clouds.

*I knew this seemed too easy.*

Chris’s blue eyes went wide as saucers, and he swerved to avoid the oncoming nightmare, screaming into his radio mic as our convoy scattered. “*Wyvern!*”
