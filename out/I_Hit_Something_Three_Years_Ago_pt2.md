"What was the name of the person teaching you to drive?"

"My driving instructor? Well,I can't remember his name exactly,but I know his last name was Slecht. Hopefully that can give you a lead," I inform her. 

"Sletch? I recognise that name. Do you remember his hair colour?" she asks. "His hair was mostly a light brown with blonde highlights," I reply. "How would you know who it is based on those details?" "I once had a friend with that last name. He was one of the few people that knew about the mistreatment I endured at home. My teachers wouldn't believe me,due to my parents lying about me being troubled," she states."My friend had a father that was a friend to the snakes I referred to as my family. I was never told what his job was exactly,but I knew he worked at the DMV. If I can find him,I can finally rest my soul," she concludes

"Alright then. I assume that this is the part where I can go back home and you can get your revenge,since I can't really do anything else because I'm alive," I apprise. "What do you mean? You're job is nowhere near complete. We've only just begun," she says,her tone lowering. 

"Well,like I said. I can't do much else because I'm alive and don't have the ability to phase through walls or levitate like you," I answered in a slightly shakey voice. I'm starting to get concerned for my saftey now. I have a feeling if I've gotten myself into a dangerous situation.

"I'm surprised you haven't realized yet. Have you noticed how your arms look?" she questions. I roll up the sleeves of my jacket and notice my tanned skin has gone mostly transparent,with only the slightest bit of colour in them. "You're no longer alive,at least for the time being. You have now fully committed to helping me and by doing that,you've entered the spirit world. You now have three days to help me. If you haven't completed with all your orders by then,you'll be stuck here," she informs.

"Now wait,if you knew my soul would leave my body for a 72 hour period,why wouldn't you tell me before I agreed?!" This is starting to become more agitating than I thought. "Well if I told you,I thought you wouldn't help me. I've spoken to some of the other spirits here and they told me that they had some unfortunate experiences when they told their helpers the conditions before they agreed,those unfortunate events being the death of thier helper and I didn't want that to happen to you," she explained.

"Okay,that's reasonable enough. If that concludes all formalities and contracts about signing away my soul,let's get going," I suggested. "Very well. Again,thank you for assisting me in this vengeful journey. I'm sure I'll be plenty satisfied with the end results," she states. I notice that the longer I speak to her,the less friendly she seems to get. Her words are becoming more and more  nefarious.

We begin walking to the supposed direction of my instructor's house and as we're walking,the sky seems to fade to a permanent dark grey colour. There's also a mist that makes it incredibly hard to see. I keep on hearing voices behind me but when I turn to look,there's nothing there. "Stop turning around," I hear the wraith walking next to me say. She doesn't turn to face me and keeps looking straight ahead as she continues speaking."If you keep on falling for the phantom's tricks,they'll eventually get you," she informs. 

I simply nod and continue walking. What have I gotten myself into. I never considered any possible consequences of going along with this plan. I was so willing to sacrifice myself for someone that I didn't even consider what the people around me would think. 

How would Lorraine or my brother react once they notice I've gone missing. If I suddenly come back after this mission,I'll most likely be taken in for questioning. I don't really think I'll be taken seriously if I say I was essentially kidnapped by the ghost of a girl I ran over by accident three years ago to help her get revenge. 

All of a sudden,she stops walking and I stop in turn. I look at her and I see her staring at the massive house in front of us. I switch my attention to the Manor that stands before us as I hear her say:

"We're here."
