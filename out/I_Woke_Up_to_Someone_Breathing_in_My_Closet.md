I never thought I would have a story like this but it is still so vivid that I cannot shake it. This happened about a year ago when I was living alone in a small apartment. I usually keep my doors locked and my phone within reach so I felt safe until that night.

It was around two in the morning and I had just fallen asleep after a long shift. My bedroom is small with the bed pushed against the wall and the closet on the opposite side. I usually sleep light but I thought I was completely out. Then I heard it, slow and deliberate breathing coming from the closet. At first I convinced myself it was a half-awake dream, maybe snoring or imagining things. But the sound continued, soft, steady, and deliberate.

I froze. My heart was pounding so hard I thought it would burst. Every instinct screamed that something was wrong but I was too terrified to move. The breathing got louder, almost as if whoever or whatever was in there knew I could hear them now.

I tried to convince myself it was a rodent or maybe the wind. But the breathing was not random or quick. It was measured and patient like someone was watching me. My mind raced as I reached for my phone on the nightstand. My hands were shaking so badly I dropped it on the floor. I tried to calm myself and slowly inched my eyes toward the closet.

The door was slightly open. Not much, maybe just an inch, but enough to let a shadow stretch into the room. I could feel my blood running cold. I wanted to run but I could not. I remembered the baseball bat under my bed. My body moved almost automatically, reaching for it while keeping my eyes locked on the closet.

I gripped the bat and whispered “Hello?” My voice barely made a sound. The breathing stopped for a second then started again, louder this time, like a warning. I realized whoever it was must have known I noticed them. Panic hit me fully and I screamed at the top of my lungs, flinging the closet door open.

It was empty. My clothes were hanging normally and nothing was out of place. I checked behind the curtains, under the bed, and even in the bathroom. Nothing. No footprints and no signs of anyone ever being there. My heart was still racing and my hands were shaking so badly I could not hold the bat properly.

I stayed up the rest of the night with every light in the apartment on. I even called a friend to stay on the phone with me until sunrise. I never found out who or what was there. I changed the locks the next day, installed a new security chain, and started keeping a knife on my nightstand. Every night since I check the closet before turning off the lights and I never sleep with my bedroom door open.

The scariest part is not just that something was in my closet. I know I was not dreaming. I could still feel the presence for a few seconds after I turned on the lights like a shadow lingering in the corner. I cannot explain it and I do not want to try. The thought that it could happen again haunts me every night. Sometimes when I hear a small noise in the apartment I swear I hear that same slow deliberate breathing.
