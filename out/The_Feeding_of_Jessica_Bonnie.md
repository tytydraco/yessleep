Jessica Bonnie first came to me when I was 25, she smelled like the damp earth of a shallow grave. Her skin was patchwork, stitched together with threads, so crude they looked like spider legs crawling across her body. Her left arm didn’t match the rest of her; it was a pale, gangly limb that must have belonged to someone much taller. Her right eye was glassy, barely moving, while the left twitched wildly, as though it were scanning the room for prey.

She wasn’t supposed to be my responsibility. My parents didn’t leave a manual for what to do when your sister is a monster. They’d vanished before I could even ask, leaving Jessica Bonnie, a nightmare pieced together in a lab, as my burden. At first, I fed her raw chicken from the grocery store. She was just a kid then, as close to innocent as something like her could get. She’d slurp it up, bloody strands of meat dangling from her stitched lips, and curl up in the corner, making little growls that sounded almost content.

As she grew, the raw meat wasn’t enough. “Alive,” she growled one evening, her voice rough and guttural, like stones grinding against each other. “Want it... alive.”

I tried to reason with her. “Jess, you can’t... it’s not right.”

Her glassy eye turned toward me, unblinking, while the other darted around like a frantic animal. “Alive,” she snarled, drool pooling on her chin. Her smell was stronger now, a mix of wet fur and coppery blood, making the air in our cramped apartment feel heavy.

The first time I brought her a live rat, I told myself it wasn’t so bad. She snapped its neck in seconds, tearing into it with a ferocity that made me turn away. Her sharp teeth, mismatched and uneven, gleamed as they worked through bone.

“Good,” she growled, her voice dripping with satisfaction. “More.”

From rats, we escalated to stray cats and then dogs. Each time, I hated myself more. Jessica Bonnie never showed remorse—only hunger. Her patchwork face, oddly expressive despite its construction, would light up with something close to joy whenever I brought her something new to feed on.

The night she demanded something human, I knew I’d reached a line I couldn’t uncross.

“Jessica Bonnie,” I whispered, my voice trembling. “No. I won’t.”

Her growl was low, almost a purr, but her mismatched hands clenched into fists. “Hungry,” she said, her teeth bared in a grimace. “Need it.”

Days passed, and her hunger grew unbearable. She clawed at the walls, leaving deep gouges in the drywall. Her smell became unbearable—a foul mix of rot and desperation. I avoided her, locking myself in my room, but her growls seeped through the cracks like smoke.

I finally broke.

The man was homeless, sleeping in an alley I passed on my way home. I told myself he wouldn’t be missed, that it wasn’t as bad as it seemed. But as I dragged him into our apartment and laid him at Jessica Bonnie’s feet, the weight of my choice crushed me.

“Good,” she growled, her voice tinged with a dark excitement. Her mismatched eyes gleamed as she pounced, her sharp teeth sinking into the man’s flesh. His screams echoed through the apartment, drowning out my sobs.

When she was finished, Jessica Bonnie looked at me, her patchwork face smeared with blood. For the first time, I saw something almost human in her expression. Gratitude, maybe.

“Jack,” she said softly, her voice raspy but clear. “Thank you.”

I turned away, bile rising in my throat. Jessica Bonnie is my sister, and as a caretaker, I must feed her.
