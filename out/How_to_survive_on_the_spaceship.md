 

Welcome new crew member, you are aboard the |}|-;|\_\]/\~/-\\, the largest mining ship ever made! We have a couple of rules up here, I will quickly review them, make sure to follow them for your own safety!  
If you hear voices, Ignore them, It is not real, The divine artifact stored aboard the spaceship is the most likely cause. If you hear movement in vents at any time, simply run, there is no hiding from them, they will kill themselves just to find and rip you apart  
The morgue is possibly one of the worst places to be, they are not dead, they are simply waiting for a chance to strike. It is best to barricade yourself if you find yourself trapped in the morgue with no escape, this is not to protect yourself from any harm but rather to keep them from escaping.  
If you get fatally injured, it is best to grab the nearest firearm and shoot yourself in the head, this is to prevent you from retaining your consciousness when you turn.  
Avoid holding any sharp objects such as knives are there is always a small chance the voices will drive you to insanity, you don't want to be holding something that you could harm yourself with when that happens.

If you find a spot without anyone around, it is best to barricade yourself, this will not stop them from getting in as you can never truly prevent the inevitable

Escape pods are most likely broken due to the power outage on the ship, so don't bother trying to use them in order to escape, They won't work.

If you see a long-deceased loved one, Do not approach them, they are simply fragments of your imagination.

It will take you some time, But eventually, you must accept the fact that rescue will NOT come, The ship is far gone and any human that attempts to step foot on it will die in minutes.  
If you are unable to find any shelter, food, and water it is best to end your own life, as being caught is a fate far worse than death

If you are being chased by one of them, Try to find a sharp/blunt object and fight back, running is of no use as they are much faster than you, there is an almost 100% chance of death, But it is worth a try.

Don't try to help anyone else besides yourself, For all you know they could be on the verge of turning, And if they do while in the same room as you, It is game over, Newly turned are much faster and stronger than the ones that turned a while ago, Your best option is to simply terminate yourself as there is not much that you can do.

If you are anywhere on this ship then your best bet is to simply wait and pray that you die painlessly, It is not a matter of if you die but rather of when you die.

Thank you for following the rules, and have a great time on the |}|-;|\_\]/\~/-\\!

this is my first "story" so it is probably shitty
