Morgan?” said Anastasia in a soft and somewhat tentative voice.

“Don’t worry.  It’s just me Annie”, I responded.  One thing to know about Anastasia was that most people didn’t normally call her that.  People usually referred to her as just Annie since Anastasia is a bit of a long name.  But I really like it.  I think it’s a beautiful name.  That’s why I always use her full name whenever I talk about her.  

But by then, I had already gotten into the habit of just calling her “Annie” whenever I spoke to her, just like everyone else did.  It felt a bit awkward referring to her as “Anastasia” to her face.  It always kinda felt to me like “Annie” was the name she preferred anyway.  That was typically what she went by.  So when talking to her, it was always the one I used.

“How long were waiting outside?” She asked.

“Not that long.  Like a minute or two.” I responded.

"So, you didn’t get here early then?  Perhaps only a few minutes ago?” She asked a bit imploringly, as though hoping my answer would be yes.

“Uh, yeah”. I lied.  “I got here at like 2:01 or 2:02 maybe” I said.   Anastasia looked visibly relieved by this information.  It seemed like she was afraid that I had seen what had happened with her clock at 2 AM on a Friday night, or Saturday morning, or whatever you want to call it.  And I’ll admit, it was a pretty shocking and terrifying surprise to see.  I had kinda figured the clock only acted up at midnight on weeknights.  But once this Stage One business came up, I had to seriously start questioning that idea.  Had her clock already done this at midnight too?  If it could happen at 2AM, when else could this happen?  

Nevertheless, I made sure she didn’t find out what I had seen.  
She let me in and we quietly headed over to her room.  It was the one I had seen through the window, just as I had figured it would be.  Except now the clock was covered by her blanket.  So, apparently, after she woke up she had covered her clock with a blanket and then opened the door for me.  I couldn't quite guess as to why, but it didn't really matter much to me anyway.

She offered me a swivel chair from in front of her desktop computer and then sat herself down on her bed.  I had so many questions, but I almost didn’t even know which ones to start with.  Or even which ones I’d feel comfortable asking.  This whole thing still felt so ridiculous and I still felt so stupid asking questions. I was beginning to worry this would all just become an awkward silence until Anastasia broke it.

“I’m very pleased you could make it.  With all the snow covering our unplowed roads, I had contemplated the possibility that you would have waited for a more convenient occasion under less inclement circumstances to come see me.  I would not have blamed you in the slightest if that was precisely what you had done.  So, you’ll forgive me if I was perhaps a bit taken aback by the fact that you had indeed managed to arrive, despite the unideal circumstances,” she said.

“It wasn’t that bad.  Once I had a sense of where the road was, it wasn’t too difficult getting here.  You’re actually closer to my house than I expected.  You’re only like 4 miles from my place.” I told her.

“Good.  I’m glad it wasn’t too long and arduous of a trip here.  That will make our future meetings much more possible.  I was concerned that we ultimately wouldn’t be able to speak to one another on matters of Sleep Points without your parents driving you over.  Surely, they would only agree to do such a thing during the day.  My father would then be made aware of your presence, and he is not very taken to allowing for me to invite members of the opposite sex over.  That is why it was necessary for me to demand you come in the dead of night as opposed to when I would have been free during the day.  

Not only am I very busy and have very little free time during the day, but even if I was able to somehow schedule you in, my father is very protective of me and would have never allowed you into our home being that you are, of course, a member of the male sex.”  She explained.  "While I certainly appreciate the sentiment, I do at times find it to be rather superfluously restrictive.  However, I do not foresee my father's temperament on this topic changing at any point in the near future.  Therefore, I accept this state of affairs as there is very little that can be done to alter it," she said.  

Maybe this was just the typical monotone voice she had when talking about anything, but luckily it didn't sound like too much of sore subject to her.  She did still seem like she would've pretty seriously appreciated it if her dad was a little less strict, but she didn't seem to talk about it as if it was a huge deal to her.  More of a minor inconvenience than anything.  Just a small obstacle that she seemed to feel as though she could fairly easily brush aside and overcome.

“in any case, since I have to have you over so late and I would hate to cause you to become sleep deprived before the start of a school day, that explains why I insisted on having you over on a Friday night, as opposed to the night immediately after I handed you my note, which was a Thursday night.” She explained further.

“I thought it was because the clock wouldn’t be a threat on Friday nights.” I said.

“That too.  The Sandman will only cause you trouble on Sunday through Thursday nights.” She said.  Suddenly, her clock under her blanket started to rattle and glow.  For a brief moment, I could even see the face in the clock through the blanket.  But then it vanished, and her clock went back to normal. 

“Is that what you call what comes out of the clock when you have to hide under the covers?”  I asked, being careful not to say its name again.

“Yes.  Unlike Sleep Points, the entity responds to only one name.  However, Sleep Points goes by many different names to many different people.  Because being asleep is such a crucial aspect of survival in this game that I call 'Sleep Points', that is the reason why I call it by the name that I do," explained Anastasia.

"So, like, when he, or it, comes out of my clock at midnight, I’m never asleep.  I always have my entire body under the covers, including my head, and I make sure to stay perfectly still, but I’ve never had to be asleep so far.” I told her.

“Ah yes.  That is because you only began participating in Sleep Points on the Monday of last week.  This will mean that you are still in Stage One.” She explained.

“I remember you had said that this afternoon.  What exactly does "Stage One" mean?” I asked her.

“As the game goes on, additional rules are added in that you are required to abide by.  For now, you have survived by hiding under your covers and staying still at midnight on Sunday through Thursday Nights.  And that is exactly what you should be doing.  If any part of your body is hanging out of the covers when he arrives, he will snatch it and your entire body with you.  And you will be at his mercy.” She said.  “It is also essential that you remain motionless when he arrives as well.  If you are moving, he may think you are doing something to distract yourself from trying to fall asleep.  Make no mistake, he knows that you are not asleep.  He can always tell.  But the blanket will, to some extent, act like a protective shield.  So long as it completely covers you and you keep it perfectly motionless, you will be safe from his attacks, regardless of whether you are asleep or not.  For now.” She told me.

“So, Stage One is just hiding under your blanket and not moving it whenever the Sandman comes?” I asked.

“That essentially summarizes the rules that you will be held to for the time being.” She said matter-of-factly.  "However, to be clear, the blanket can only protect you if it covers you completely and you are in your own bed. Anything less will be insufficient.  In addition, you must never allow for your phone to die because your blanket will lose all protective power, and it will never be returned.  No matter what blanket you use from them on, none of them will ever work again," she explained.  "Although, as you can see, my clock is covered by a blanket, this would not protect me from an impending attack.  Your blanket only protects you under very particular circumstances and I would like to be entirely certain that you understand this," she said.

"Okay.  Understood", I said.  Anastasia looked satisfied with that, so I moved on the next question I had.  “So, when does Stage Two start?” I asked her.

“That was the primary motivation behind having you here as soon as possible.  Stage Two will, in fact, start very soon.  Every time you enter a new stage, an additional rule is added that must be observed along with all other rules previously required of you.  The rate at which you receive sleep points will also increase.  At Stage One, you are given 10 Sleep Points every night.  In Stage Two, that will increase to 20 Sleep Points per night.” She finished.

“How many stages are there?” I asked.

“I will address later stages as you arrive at them.  For now, do not worry about them.  I do not want any needless information keeping you up.  That is why I keep my clock hidden under a light blanket.  If I am constantly looking at the time, even when I don’t need to know it, that will greatly impair my ability to fall asleep.  This is why I use a separate blanket as protection” She said.

But that didn't add up to me.  After all, I could see her clock perfectly fine when The Sandman came out at 2 AM.  She had to have put it on the clock after waking up just after 2 AM and before getting the door for me at 2:05.  Since she had to have been asleep at 2 AM, that had to mean that, at some point throughout the night, she fell asleep just fine without the blanket over her clock.  This must've been for a different reason.  And as our meeting went on, I became more and more sure of why she really had done it.

“Now, speaking of falling asleep, I must divert our conversation to the subject of Stage Two once again.  Because that is exactly what it will require of you.  Stage Two will start this upcoming Monday on the 25th of February.  You will wake up at 6 AM.  Along with doing as you have done thus far, you must also fall asleep for at least 90 minutes continuously within the following 72 hours.  If your 90 minutes of continuous sleep have not been completed by the end of 72 hours, he will break out of your clock when the 72 hours are up, and you will have failed the Stage.  If you ever go 72 hours without 90 minutes of continuous sleep from the start of Stage Two and onward, you will have failed the stage in that case also.  Once again, you will be at his mercy.”  She said.

“I don’t think I’ve ever gone that long without 90 minutes of sleep in my entire life.  It sounds, like, insanely easy.” I said, feeling pretty confident in my ability to follow the new rule.

“I imagine you would think that, Morgan.  However, when the second stage commences, you will find falling asleep more difficult than it has ever been up to that point by far.  It will feel as though your body will simply refuse to fall asleep.  It will still be possible of course, but again, it will take a degree of effort that you most likely will have never needed prior to the start of Stage Two.” She said in a tone of voice trying to seriously communicate the potential hardship of the upcoming stage.

By that point we had been talking for over half an hour.  I looked at my watch and the time was 2:40. I also saw the beginnings of a red glow from the clock under her blanket.  Was it seriously happening again?  How many times could The Sandman possibly break out on a given night?

She continued, “While I’m still thinking of it, you have not attempted to alleviate yourself from the curse of this game by doing something rash such as breaking the clock, have you?”.  It seemed like such an obvious solution and yet that had never crossed my mind even once.  But of course, she was obviously asking since trying that clearly wouldn’t have been a good idea.

“Uh, no.  Why?” I asked, figuring that the truthful answer would actually be the one that she would want to hear, for once.

“If you think you will no longer have to engage with Sleep Points by breaking the clock, you are correct.  But what you will then experience will be perhaps even worse than allowing for him to capture you.  Do you remember how I told you it will become more difficult to fall asleep once Stage Two starts?” She asked.

“Uh, yeah”, I said.  "You literally talked about it like 2 minutes ago, why would I have forgotten?" I asked.

“The question was rhetorical," she responded.  "In any case, compared to what you will experience upon having broken the clock, going to sleep after Stage Two will feel like a walk in the park.  If you break the clock, you won’t have to deal threats from your clock ever again, because it is broken.  But you will never sleep again either.  Your brain will no longer be capable of allowing you to do it.  It will, at that point, become simply impossible.  Your hippocampus will become so irreparably damaged that you will become fundamentally incapable of ever sleeping again.  The human body can only go so long without sleep.  You will eventually die."

"Okay, so stupid question I know, but what exactly is a hippocampus?" I asked her.

"The hippocampus is a portion of the brain that serves many functions, but the only one relevant to you is its involvement with sleep regulation."

"Alright.  So, how does breaking the clock cause a part of my brain to become irreparably fucked?" I asked, pretty skeptically.

"Why did the clock appear in your room?  How does it consistently unleash horrors beyond comprehension on a nightly basis?  How does the glass get consistently repaired each and every time it is broken?  Just because a phenomenon does not have a readily available explanation does not force it to be untrue.  I know that what I have told you is true because I have seen it for myself in many Sleep Points players before you.  This is no fate to subject yourself to.  You must take my word," she insisted.  

“Now then, another reason you might be skeptical is because, from your perspective, you might believe the clock to break every night and to subsequently repair itself by morning.  But that is not true.  Only the circular glass pane in front of the clock’s face breaks.  And once he is gone, it is immediately restored.  The clock itself, however, remains completely intact the whole time.”  She said as if I didn’t know this already.  But of course, she wasn't supposed to know that I knew, so I had to go along with it as if this was all totally new information to me.  “If the mechanisms responsible for the clock’s ability to keep time get damaged, however, only then will you suffer the consequences I have described," said Anastasia.

By then it was 2:50 and her clock was now glowing an undeniably bright red from underneath the blanket.  I could tell that Anastasia was all too aware that I was beginning to catch on.  She quickly began to try to rush me out.  

“You must go.  We will discuss Sleep Points again at the same time tomorrow morning if you are able to come.  I can answer no more of your questions.  Hopefully the answers you have received thus far have been sufficient.”  She said, in a rather hasty tone of voice.

I didn’t fight her on this.  Even though I had a shitload more questions to ask, The Sandman looked like he was about to break out again for the second, maybe even third, time that night.  And for all I knew, Anastasia might have actually needed to be asleep by that point.  She would’ve had only 10 minutes left to fall asleep.  I usually need at least 20.  Sometimes more than 30.  That kind of pressure to fall asleep so quickly would kill me.  But I guess she wouldn’t have known the exact time.   Maybe she wouldn’t have known just how little time she had.  Maybe there really was more to hiding the clock behind one of her blankets than just trying to hide it from me.  Maybe she really was trying to hide it from herself.

After I was rushed out, I just got back into my dad’s truck and started to head home.  It had stopped snowing, so I at least didn’t have to worry about the snow getting any worse. Now that the snow had stopped, the sky had also cleared up quite a bit.  It’s always really nice to be at out that time of night during winter in Alaska when the sky is clear.  The famous Aurora Borealis were very bright and beautiful in the sky.  I wanted nothing more in that moment than to just lie out under the stars with Anastasia as we watched the wonderful light show.

But I still had to pay attention to the road while I was driving. Or at least where it felt like the road was since it was still covered in a good 6 inches of snow.  I was getting distracted by the all the lights now visible in the sky and had almost fallen off now and then.  Luckily, I had successfully retraced all my steps back to my house.  Or at least most of them.

Ya see, after I made a left turn out of my house, there was a right turn after that.  A right turn where I could’ve theoretically made the wrong turn since there was also a road going to the left.  It made a T-shape.  Since, on my way up, I could turn either left or right, I knew when to make that turn thanks to the stop sign.  However, on my way back from Anastasia’s house, this stop sign wasn’t directly in front of me anymore.

So basically, I had kind of completely missed my turn since I wasn’t paying attention.  And in that case, it wasn’t even because I was distracted by the northern lights.  I was honestly trying so hard to keep myself centered on the road that I just completely missed it.  I didn’t realize this until I found that I had been on the same straight stretch of road for a suspiciously long time.  
  
I realized I had made an insane mistake.  I started to panic.  Would I even be able to make it back home?  What would happen when the car ran out of power and the heater turned off?  Was I just going to freeze to death?  Even if I could somehow be rescued and the cold didn’t kill me, my parents sure as hell would.  
I tried to stay calm.  I wasn’t totally lost.  I still had some idea as to how to get back.  The first thing I would have to do is make a complete U-Turn.  So that was what I did.  It wasn't easy with all the snow in the way, but luckily the road was wide enough to let me make one.  

I just kept on reminding myself that I had been going totally straight since I missed my turn.  I just had to keep doing that until I found the stop sign from the turn I would need to make back into own neighborhood.  I was starting to get a bit worried since it was talking a little longer than I was hoping to find the stop sign, but I did find it eventually.  I made a right back onto my street and stayed calm in the knowledge that there would be no more turns to miss until I finally made it back home.   

Right when I was about to make it back home, I saw something that I was seriously hoping I wouldn’t.  I began to see headlights out in the distance.  Headlights that were coming towards me.  I was driving super slow, but since the vehicle approaching me was going so fast, it didn’t matter.  I was in the middle of the road since I wasn’t expecting to have to pass anybody, and so was the car coming toward me.

I figured whoever was in the car would be a much more experienced driver than me.  So I figured it would be best to stay put and let him move.  But he didn’t.  He sped up and kept driving straight toward me.  I was going to die in a car wreck if I didn’t immediately get the hell out of the way.  I slammed on the gas and quickly lurched the car over to the right, off the side of the road, right before the car coming toward me could hit me.

In all the commotion, I had gotten the car rammed into a ditch.  So that was probably gonna take a while to undo.  Just before the car passed, I could see a face in the car.  It wasn’t the one from the clock, as I was at that point, half expecting.  It was Ezra.  I knew he was an insensitive prick, but I had never once suspected he’d try to do something that would actually kill me.  He drove off too quickly for me to accost him, however, so now I was just left with the task of getting the truck out of the ditch.  

Thankfully, the snow was packed pretty tightly, so the truck actually didn’t fall down as deeply as it could’ve.  But that didn’t make the process of getting it out that much easier.  I was still seriously wondering if I would have to get this thing towed.  All I could think to do was push.  My pushing, of course, did nothing.  I turned the car back on again and then tried turning it further to the right so that it would be perpendicular to the ditch.  That way, if I drove forward, I would I immediately be out.  

I just started hitting the gas pedal as hard as possible to get myself out. That didn’t get the truck out, but it did still displace a bunch of snow, causing the truck to sink even deeper into the ditch.  Since the edge of the ditch was so steep, I also failed to turn the truck in the slightest.

I tried to see if I could at least turn the car to the left and drive along the ditch.  While it was very difficult to maneuver my car, I could still, slowly but surely turn it so that it was parallel with the ditch.  It was after all, closer to being parallel with the ditch than it was to being perpendicular to it.  The truck didn’t fit inside the ditch entirely, so it was still a bit tilted at an angle, causing the stuff inside to shift downward and to the left.  But I had officially gotten myself to a point where I could still technically drive forward.  Not nearly as easily as before, but I still could.  If my truck just hugged the side of the ditch as it was currently doing, the ditch would eventually and gradually rise back up into ground that was level with the rest of the ground if I kept following it for long enough.

My plan managed to work.  When I reached the end of the ditch, the slope of the ground inside the ditch back up to the rest of the ground was a bit steeper than what I was hoping for.  However, it still wasn’t nearly as sharp as the slope at the edges of the ditch, which I had already found to be too steep to drive my truck up and over.  But it was still a challenge.  It wasn’t easy, but when I reached the end of the ditch, I was finally able to drive my car out of it.  

By the time I did, though, I was already well past my home, meaning I would have to make another U-turn in order to get back.  I must’ve driven at least a half mile before I finally found what I recognized as my house.  I turned into the driveway and parked the truck in the garage.  I didn’t even have to open it since I had already left it open from when I had first driven out of it.  

Unfortunately, since it stopped snowing, the tire tracks that I had made in the driveway weren’t just going to be covered up on their own.  Then I started thinking about the tire tracks leading into the driveway.  Even if I filled in the tire tracks on the driveway with snow, it would have still looked awfully suspicious with tire tracks stopping right outside my driveway.

But the tire tracks didn’t just stop at my driveway.  Thanks to good ol’ Ezra the Edgelord’s attempt at literally assassinating me, there were still tire tracks from his truck from when he passed my house.  So all I would have to do to stop mom and dad from seeing the tracks form dad’s truck would be to fill up the tracks in the driveway.

I got to work on this.  I didn’t know how long it would take, though.  I thought about what Anastasia said about how I’d get hypothermia if I stayed out long enough in the cold.  But I still had to cover my tracks.  I got out a shovel from the garage and got to filling.  Thankfully our driveway was not too exceptionally long.  I must’ve only filled in the tracks about halfway, if even that.  But I figured that was good enough.  They weren’t blatantly obvious anymore.  I spent another few minutes just kind of leveling out the snow over the driveway as well, in order to make the tracks even less noticeable.  Now I just had to go inside and get some shuteye.  With everything that had happened so far, I was totally tuckered out and was seriously looking forward to this.

I opened the door.  The house was in complete darkness.  There wasn’t a sound.  I made sure to, carefully and quietly, climb up the stairs to my room.  I turned on the lights once I made my way to my room and was once again scared half to death.  I was so terrified and taken off guard by the sight that I totally froze up and didn’t even flinch.  I was paralyzed by what I was seeing.  There he was, standing in the middle of my own bedroom as if he owned the place.  

“Wha- what the fuck are you doing here?   Why the hell did you try and fucking murder me?  What the fuck is wrong with you?” I asked in a total panic.

“Shhhhhh Shh Shh Shh Shh.  Don’t wanna wake up the parents now.  You’ll wish that killed you," said Ezra with a twisted grin.  "Oh, and next time, maybe try locking the door to your garage," he said, before opening my window and promptly jumping out of it from the second floor and plummeting to the ground.  I guess the snow must’ve broken his fall somewhat, but that still had to have broken some bones.

I didn’t know how he knew I would be out driving.  I didn’t know why he tried to hit me with his car.  I had no idea how he even knew where I lived.  And I sure as hell had no idea why he thought it was a good idea to up and jump out of a second story window.  I wanted to keep asking myself all these questions, but I knew it would be no good.  There was no explaining that kid.
