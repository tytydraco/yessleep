I dont know how or why I escaped but im here now and I need help its still here , watching me…  

We lived in a small town in england, id like to say it was very quiet from what I remember and the people were all friendly. The town consisted of a decorated market square with a series of shops and stalls all displaying various trinkets. They all had a common theme , old timey but well preserved. There was one however that stood out from the rest ,what appeared to be a victorian style cottage with 2 large windows either side of a shotty, run down wooden door which looked as if it had carved separate paths for each water droplet that ran down it.

Approaching the windows with intent to peer inside,An army of silhouettes Stood with what looked to be a thousand little eyes staring back at me. as i moved my face closer to the tainted glass, it fabricated into a collection of old porcelain dolls and other antiques ,a rather noticeable beam of light shrouding them emerging from the antique chandelier swaying from the ceiling.

Looking at the dolls made my stomach churn as I couldnt help but think they were staring at me judging while they did it “what the fuck” i thought to myself. i shook it off and out of curiousity, i approached the door… it creaked for a second and then swung open polluting the air with a horrifying crashing sound fabricating my worst fear right before my very eyes.

I progressed forward through the narrow frame and to my suprise the room was barren and bare. Exept for 3 small shelving units that supported the antiques and a desk holding a small cash register. Behind the desk stood what looked to be a older gentleman wearing a striped blazer, finished with a top hat and tied with a big red ribbon in the shape of a rose.

In a rather scratchy and overly enthusiastic voice “HELLO! Welcome to my store” he exclaimed. “Why are you here” He immediately followed in a rather low gravely voice with a different expression.

I was confused but I asked about the town and the best places to see and after 2 minutes of rallying sentences, i finally landed on the question “do you ever hear about much crime these parts?” to which he responded” nothing bad ever happens in this town hehe” followed by “dont listen to him hes crazy”again in a low gravely voice.

I decided to say goodbye to the clearly troubled gentleman and decided To be on my way picking up some groceries on my way home . I arrived in the driveway with the fresh sausages that I had purchased from the local butcher and entered my abode expecting to prepare lunch.

On my way to the kitchen I Left my shoes in the usual place by the table on the left of the stairs and trotted to the kitchen where I began to fry my produce. Thinking about my prior experience whilst doing it “why the hell did he say that” I told myself and after a while I came to the conclusion that I was Overreacting and let it go.

On my way back up the stairs and out of the corner of my eye I noticed something very peculiar, my shoes were facing the opposite direction to which I had previously left them.

Let me know if anyone would like me to continue this story or i should just give up on it
