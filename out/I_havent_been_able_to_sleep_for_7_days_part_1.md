I don’t really know how to start this. I’ve never posted anything on Reddit before, at least not like this. I’m not a writer. I’m not trying to scare anyone. I just…I don’t have anyone else to talk to right now, and I don’t know what’s happening to me.

I haven’t slept properly in seven days.

Not real sleep. Not the kind where you drift off and wake up knowing you rested. I’m getting these tiny scraps, twenty minutes, maybe forty if my body gives up for a moment, but I come out of them feeling worse. Disoriented. Shaky. Like I fell asleep underwater and clawed my way back up too fast.

My thoughts keep slipping out of my hands. I forget what I’m doing mid-step. Sometimes I blink and realize I’ve been standing still in the middle of my kitchen with the faucet running. My chest feels tight, and I keep having this buzzing feeling under my skin, like my nerves are vibrating.

I know I should probably take something like Benadryl or melatonin or whatever, but the idea of being knocked out for 12 hours scares me. I don’t want to wake up groggy and confused. I don’t want to depend on pills just to function. I want my body to work the way it’s supposed to. I want to sleep without fear of what I’ll feel like when I wake up.

I don’t really have anyone in my life I can ask for help. No close friends. My coworkers barely remember my name. My family isn’t around anymore. So I figured…I don’t know. Reddit might be the only place left where someone might listen.

I guess I should explain what happened tonight. Maybe that’s why I’m writing this.

I live on the second floor of an old apartment building, Unit 2B. It’s the kind of place where the walls are thin, the stairwell echoes like a cave, and the radiator sounds like it’s dying every time it turns on. Normally, the noise doesn’t bother me. You get used to it.

But the last week…everything sounds wrong.
Sharper.
Closer.
Big.

I don’t know how else to describe it. Like the noises have weight now.

Tonight, around an hour ago, I heard my upstairs neighbor pacing. He lives in 3B. I’ve never talked to him, but he’s always seemed quiet. A loner, maybe. Kind of like me.

The pacing started around…I don’t know, 9:30pm? I’ve stopped trusting clocks. But the footsteps were heavy and fast, like he was wearing boots or running back and forth in place. I could feel the rhythm of it in my chest.

At first I thought he was anxious. Maybe he couldn’t sleep either.

Then there was this thud.

It was so loud dust fell from my ceiling. I actually sat up in bed. I thought maybe he dropped something heavy, furniture or weights or something. But then…

Then I heard something dragging.

Not quick.
Not like pulling a chair.
Slow.
Long.
A scraping weight across his floor…and my ceiling.

It went on longer than it should have.

I froze. I didn’t know if I should go check on him. I even stood in my doorway for a minute, staring at the stairs, but something in my chest tightened and I couldn’t make myself move. My hands were shaking so bad I had to lean on the doorframe. I kept telling myself it was nothing. Just regular apartment noise. Just old pipes or bad flooring or furniture shifting.

But I don’t know anymore.

The dragging stopped.
Then it went completely silent upstairs.

Not normal silence. I mean the kind of silence where the whole building feels like it’s holding its breath.

That was an hour ago.
And I haven’t heard anything since.

I don’t know if I should go check. Or if that would make things worse. Or if I’m just overtired and my brain is turning normal sounds into something else. I honestly don’t trust myself right now.

Between the lack of sleep and the noises and whatever that was upstairs…I feel like I’m coming apart.

I’m sorry this is so long. I just didn’t know what else to do. I don’t want to call the cops and look insane. I don’t want to bang on his door at almost 11pm. I don’t want to ignore something serious if someone is actually hurt. I don’t want to keep spiraling like this.

So…I’m asking.
Asking Reddit.
Asking any of you.

How long can someone go without sleep before their brain starts making things up?
Should I be worried about what I heard?
Should I check on my neighbor?
What would you do if you were me?

Any advice would help.
I feel really alone right now.
And I’m so tired.
