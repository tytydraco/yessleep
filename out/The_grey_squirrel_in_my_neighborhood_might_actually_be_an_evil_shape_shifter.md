I just moved to a new apartment. The area is nice. Neighbors are friendly. But the odd thing is this squirrel in my neighborhood keeps stalking me. 

How do I know? Because it trails me every time I go out for a walk. It hops along our neighbors’ fences. Whenever I stop to look at it, it freezes like it’s been caught committing a crime. 

I’ve dubbed this squirrel, Stranger, because he doesn’t look like other squirrels. You see, most squirrels in the area are brown with bushy tails. But this one has grey hair and a ratty tail, like it was caught in an electrical outlet. Also, part of his left ear is missing.  

Either way, he’s creepy and I’m tired of my roommates pretending like he’s not. Like, just the other day, Stranger was perched in a tree outside our apartment. I threw a rock to scare him off and he scampered away, dropping something in the grass.

When I got close to see what it was, I almost passed out: “The fuck?!”

Stranger had been chewing on —

— a human finger! 

“Gross!”

I called the police. They informed me there’d been a woman downtown who was attacked by a homeless man. She had survived, but two of her fingers had been cut off! Disgusting.

The cops came, bagged the finger. Told me to call in if I had any more questions. 

I did call the next day. Turns out the body part belonged to the woman who’d been attacked. So creepy! 

“I mean, seriously, what the hell?!” Why did Stranger have that woman’s finger? Don’t squirrels just eat nuts and stuff? Gross.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. Roommates were working late, so I was all alone. Around 2 AM, I heard scratching at the door. 

I panicked and grabbed my baseball bat. Rushed to the window. Right there in the driveway was… 

… Stranger… 

“What the —?!”

He just stared at me with those thin, dark eyes. I was so sick of him following me! I dashed out. Screaming: “You want to drop fingers around me, Dude?! Come on!”

But when I got to the driveway…

… He was gone…

I went back inside. Delirious. Coated in sweat. Turned on a movie to stay awake. But I must’ve drifted off to sleep because I awoke to the sound of metal scraping at my front door. Someone was trying to get in!

Heart pounding, I dashed into the living room. But stopped dead in my tracks because… near the front door was… a homeless man, crouched over something… his back turned toward me. 

He was wearing a black trench coat and had long grey hair. His odor was faint but disgusting, like rotten meat. And his left ear, like Stranger’s, was partially missing. Wait… what?!

“Oh my god.” I whispered and stood still, not wanting to give away my position. (Somehow he hadn’t seen or heard me yet.) 

I took a small step back, landed on a creaking floorboard. The homeless man turned. His eyes were black like Stranger’s. His smile was full of yellow teeth…

“Please… don’t hurt me…” I said, sobbing. The homeless man just laughed. Set something on the ground and went outside. 

Soon as he was gone, I barricaded the door. Called the police. I was so scared I could barely breathe. My eyes crept down to the spot where he’d been crouching… and there it was…  

… another human finger!

Over the next few weeks, my roommates and I crashed at another place. Cops searched the area. Found no signs of him. It was like he’d disappeared. Local news started calling our mystery man: “The Finger Thief.” 

Another week passed and there were still no sightings. It was like he had disappeared. Thank god. Maybe another homeless person had dealt with him.  

Days went on and I started to think: “Maybe he’s gone for good. I can get back to normal life.”

How wrong I was.

This morning, when I went outside for a walk, I saw something perched high up in a tree. It was Stranger, watching me. I’m not even sure how he found me. But he just titled his head slightly and raised a paw, like he was waving.
