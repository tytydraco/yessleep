I wasn’t meant to end up here. I was supposed to be doing something normal people do. Supermarket job, delivery driving, stacking shelves at 3am hoping nobody notices your headphones. Instead I’m standing in a place that smells like blood and industrial detergent, wondering how I got conned into this.

It started with my dad calling me at 11pm. He never calls that late unless someone’s dead or drunk.
“You still need work?” he asked.
“Obviously.”
“I’ve got a contact. Don’t ask how. Just show up. They’ll take you on.”
“Doing what?”
“A slaughterhouse job.”
“A what?”
“It pays extremely well. And they need bodies—”
“Please don’t phrase it like that.”
“—people. They need people. Just go. Tomorrow morning. Be sharp.”

My dad’s “contacts” include retired intelligence guys who talk like they still have clearance and paranoid veterans who think pigeons are recording devices. Not exactly comforting references. But I was broke. You know that dry-stomach feeling where hunger mixes with panic? That was my life. So yeah, I went.

The address wasn’t listed anywhere. Maps acted like the road didn’t exist. I had to follow some half-dead industrial track until the pavement gave up trying. The building itself looked abandoned — tall concrete walls, no sign, no windows, just a metal door like the entrance to a fallout shelter.

I knocked. And the door swung open far too fast.

A tall woman stared at me like she’d expected me down to the minute.
“You Collins?”
“Yeah.”
“You’re late.”
It was 5:01 AM. Apparently that counts as late now. Good start.

Inside, the air was cold. Not freezer cold — morgue cold. The place looked like every meat-processing documentary that tries to guilt-trip you into veganism: the chains, the hooks, the long steel tables, everything slightly damp. But the corners looked too clean. Sanitised. Like they were prepping for inspection by someone with a gun.

They handed me a suit and boots. No questions. No paperwork. No tour. Just “Put this on, keep your head down, stay in your lane.”
“What lane?” I asked.
“Processing.”
“Great. Love vague instructions.”
“You’ll learn fast.”
Nobody said it kindly.

The first hour was just me shadowing some guy named Harris. He didn’t talk except to grunt instructions. The work was basic: drag heavy carts from one section to another, spray down surfaces, move crates sealed with locks that weren’t standard locks. Military-grade stuff. One crate hissed when we rolled it over a bump, like something inside was exhaling.

“What’s in them?” I whispered.
He didn’t even look at me.
“You don’t want to know.”

That’s when the suspicions started creeping in.

The hooks on the ceiling weren’t animal-size. They were too long. Too wide apart. Some weren’t even shaped right to hold livestock. More like… limbs. And the tables were slightly angled downward toward drains. Big drains. You don’t install drains that size for chickens.

This wasn’t a place where animals died. It was a place where *things* died. Things with weight. Things that bled a lot.

My brain went straight to the worst-case scenario: illegal human slaughter. Organ harvesting. Black-market operations. All those conspiracy theories about secret programmes nobody’s allowed to talk about. The workers didn’t help — they kept their eyes down, didn’t chat, didn’t do the usual workplace small talk. Just worked with that blank “I compartmentalise or I crack” expression.

One guy — massive, bald, tattooed arm sleeves — rolled past me with a stretcher covered in a black tarp. There was a shape underneath it. Human-shaped. I swear I could make out what looked like a shoulder. I wasn’t imagining it.
“That from Bay 2?” someone asked him.
He nodded.
“Damn shame,” the worker said. “Young one too.”
My stomach dropped.

I shouldn’t have come here. Every instinct told me to get out, but rent doesn’t give you instinct breaks.

My job remained the same for days: move the sealed crates, disinfect the tables, drag tarped “carcasses” without asking what the hell was under them. They kept the lights dim in half the rooms, like they didn’t want anyone to look too closely.

The sound inside the crates didn’t help either. Thumping. Scraping. Once I heard something like… crying? A whimper? I tried to act like it was just vents settling, but I wasn’t fooling myself.

Everything pointed to one conclusion. And the longer I worked, the more it felt true:

They’re slaughtering humans here. I’m part of it.

One afternoon, they had me cart a load from Bay 4 — the only room they kept locked at all times. The moment I was inside, the smell hit different. Not animal. Not normal. Metallic but… cleaner? Strange.

I was pushing a covered rack toward the cold room when I tripped on a loose hose and instinctively grabbed the sheet to steady myself. It slipped halfway off.

And I froze.

There was a body underneath. But not a human one.

Thin. Tall. Wrong proportions. The limbs bent in angles humans don’t bend. The skin… translucent, stretched over veins that glowed faintly. No mouth. No eyes. Just a smooth ridge running down the centre of its face like a sealed zipper.

I stumbled back so fast I almost fell. The thing was breathing. Shallow, but real. Rising. Falling. A soft glow pulsing under its ribs.

My supervisor appeared behind me like she teleported.
“You weren’t supposed to see that,” she said quietly.
“I—I thought this was—”
“A human slaughterhouse?” She actually smirked. “That’s what most new hires assume. Keeps them cautious.”
“What the hell *is* that thing?”
“Livestock,” she said. “Just not from Earth.”

She said it so casually it felt like she was discussing poultry.

She walked past me and adjusted the sheet like she was tucking a child into bed.
“The wealthy want exclusivity. They want what others can’t have. These creatures come from a place we don’t advertise. A place the public isn’t ready to know about.”
“So we’re… butchering aliens for food?”
She shrugged.
“Delicacies. High-end clients. Strict confidentiality. It’s all above your pay grade.”

I stood there shaking, like an idiot, while she patted my shoulder.
“Relax. You’re part of something important.”
Important. Right. That’s one way to frame it.

Now I’m on my break, sitting in a storage room that smells like disinfectant and despair. I’m writing this because I need someone — anyone — to know what’s going on here. I’m not supposed to bring phones inside, but their security isn’t as airtight as they think.

I don’t know how long I can keep working here, cutting open things that look at me without eyes. But I know this: secrets like this don’t stay buried forever.

And maybe I’m stupid, but… someone’s got to lift the curtain sooner or later.

Imagine being responsible for revealing to the world the existence of aliens? Imagine the money I’d make!

Might as well be me.
