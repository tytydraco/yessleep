I stayed with D last night because I knew things would only get worse if I didn't. She helped me buy some colored contacts and bleach/dye my hair (I won't say what colors because C is an r/NoSleep addict). Everything went fine, but I know C will pull something. Whatever the hell she's become, it's not pleasant.

I'll admit, we did something a bit silly out of boredom. D has this tarot deck that she adores, so we decided to play around with it. I chose three cards, and she read them out for me. The first was, almost hilariously, Death. The second was the Five of Wands, and the last was the Five of Cups. She refused to tell me what they meant at first, but I begged her to. She gave in when I told her I'd wash her car.

Death means transformation, FoW means conflict, and FoC means loss and regret. Fitting, wouldn't you agree?

So far, today's been boring. C's left me alone, but I'm still scared of what she could do. I actually almost forgot that her birthday is coming up, but I'm staying far away from her. I feel like something bad will happen if I go, and I don't want to hit her again. Seeing the way her eyes went wide and tears welled was enough to make me want to beat myself up forever. I've washed my hands more than enough times, but I can still trace the area where the blood splattered.

D has put *Heathers* on, so I'm going to go watch. I'll write more tomorrow, I'm sure.

Mom and I met somewhere, and she told me something that made me blood run cold: when C was seven, she tried to kill me.

Apparently, our parents had gone outside to do something, and they came inside to find me in a puddle of blood and her with a knife in her hand. I slept through her literally cutting the skin off where my heart is, and I was always told our cat had scratched me. I still have faint X-shaped scars from it.

When she was asked why, C had only said, "It's my seventh birthday."

I was promptly sent to stay with J for a week while Mom and Dad tried to figure out what the hell was wrong with C. I wasn't told any of this until today, but that doesn't explain a lot. I still have no memory of these things, and there aren't any more explanations. All I have to go off of is what Mom says, and as foolish as it is, I don't think she'd lie.

I'm not going back home for a long time. I might as well apply for college and wait. My sister's not human anymore, I swear to Christ.

C sent me a picture today. She's on my bed, stuffed animals surrounding her like an adoring court. I know exactly which dress she's wearing despite most of it being out of frame, it's the one that reminded her of a princess. Something's captured in her teeth as she grins: a long, black braid. Hers? Mine? The caption reads:

***Did you miss me?***

Not at all, C. Not at all.

  
I don't want to call my copycat a freak, but this situation practically calls for it. I don't care if those reading this hate me for saying it, you've read worse. C and I used to curl up on weekends and read the stories on here all day. I hate all of this. I just want her back. She doesn't deserve to be stuck like this, no one does.
