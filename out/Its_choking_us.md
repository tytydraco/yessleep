**Author's note: This story is probably gonna suck as this is my first ever attempt to write an original creepypasta, so it's probably not that good (awful by any chance), full of typos, missing words, and bad grammar, but I just had this idea for a long time in my head and finally wrote it to share. Tell me if you like it or not, but let me know you thoughts.**  



The story starts with the protagonist driving home from a very tough and longer than anticipated night shift at the warehouse they work at. With online shops like Amazon growing only bigger, the workload on the regular man is overwhelming.

 

Their exhaustion and overall mood are not helping at all. Having been through a rough time since a break up, financial difficulties, not getting enough sleep the other nights, and having had a drink or two makes them keep taking wrong turns constantly, drive in the wrong direction and generally getting lost. It’s borderline criminal to drive like this, but they feel like there’s no choice.

 

After nearly ramming into a lamppost from drifting asleep behind the wheel they decide to park the car and take a nap. After parking up however, they step outside for a quick breath of fresh air before tripping on the curb and landing with a loud thud onto the pavement.

 

When they wake up they see that the sun is rising from behind the hills and an apartment building. With the pain still throbbing they get up and start stumbling around the street block, but nobody’s around.

It's not long after that they notice an elementary school is standing across the street with the lights on and the doors opened.

Believing that some staff are already inside as he slowly sees the sun rise he makes his way inside seeing if there’s someone who can help him get home or possibly call the cops on them for trespassing and thinking they’re drunk.

 

 

 

The building seems like your average school at first, the protagonist looks inside the classrooms and sees messy student desks, childish ornaments and kid’s decorations also fill the area. They kind of admire it in a way, reminding them of simpler times and not yet lost innocence. They do notice however that a lot of the building’s structure besides some of the well seems to be made out of wood with a reeds roof and all. It’s quite a unique piece of architectural work compared to the run down shithole they attended as a kid.

After remembering why they’re here, they begin to call out loudly to hear if anyone’s around since they swear they can hear distant voices. Nobody seems to answer however, but that’s when it hits their nose.

 

A strong lingering smell of smoke, not the kind you get from tobacco or cigarettes, but more like something’s burning. Shocked, but unsure what to do the protagonist runs around trying to find help, but as they enter a door their face is met by misty cloud of smoke, and the wing of the building seems to be damaged heavily by a fire. The protagonist tries to find his way out, but every exit seems to be locked.

 

All the while the building becomes more damaged as they goes further inside and almost completely destroyed by the fire and rubble yet there’s not a single flame. Believing they’ve entered some kind of nightmare, the protagonist feels like they’re going to lose it, but that’s when he hears the faint cries of children.

 

The sounds makes them get erratic from panic, there’s children trapped in here, and nobody’s helping them.

 

 

After following the sound that seemed to remain far away for a long time they finally a boy and a girl in sitting in a corner against the wall. The girl softly cries, but the protagonist tried to help her, but as they do the girl turns around and she silently mutters: ‘It’s choking us, it hurts.’

 

The protagonist tries to grab her, but is frozen as they see her body slowly turning blue and purple before bursting into flames becoming a stiff scorched corpse. The boy who was with her suffers the same strange fate soon after. Terrified now he run away as the flames become more intense. As he run away he sees another boy lying on the floor, still moving.

 

The protagonist also make their way over to him, and tries to help, but then the boy jumps up in inhumanly way and turns to him, now also looking like a scorched mess. The protagonist is frozen in place in horror as the boy begins to grab him and soon the two other children from earlier and several others come out of the dark black smoke and also grab the protagonist. flames suddenly surge around the protagonist, they all start to burn and screams out for help as they’re engulfed, flickering lights and people calling are heard, and then a bright white light then shines in the protagonists eyes which they can’t make out.

 

 

 

The protagonist is then woken up on the pavement, lying on their back. Attended  by two cops with one who holds over his flashlight over the protagonist’s face and asking if they’re okay.

 

The exhaustion then comes back to them, and they can hardly speak at all, only muttering the words. “The children, help them!.”

 

Before passing out again they hears the voice of the other cop who says that the ambulance needs to hurry up. The next day they wakes up in the hospital and is told that they were found lying on the streets by a cyclist, blood was flowing from a serious injury on the head, and they’re told they suffered a skull fracture, but no serious brain injuries.

 

Although briefly questioned by the police they say that they had done a bloodtest, but found no signs of high levels of alcohol or other substances. The doctors also conclude that it was a combination of exhaustion, stress, and dehydration that caused them to pass out which the protagonist admits to.

 

The police do ask if they’re okay since the two officers and the person who found say they were found trashing around, screaming, and sweating profusely as they laid there. The protagonist becomes hesitant to tell what they saw as nobody would likely believe them, but eventually they do.

 

The police and the doctors whilst not believing the story as expected, recommend that they should take it easy and probably seek a psychiatrist.

 

However, one of the officers then also drops a bomb saying there hasn’t been a school for years in that area. Curious, the protagonist asks what he means by that.

The officer explains that many years ago a fire broke out, and since the building was made of wood it quickly spread.

However, none of the children were harmed as the teachers were quick to evacuate them all safely. They was some worry at first since several children apparently were skipping class that day, but some of staff from the orphanage found them outside, saying they were hiding in the toilets when the fire broke out.

The protagonist then asks about the orphanage, but the police officer tells him that’s a whole different story and not his business.

 

Later on the protagonist makes a trip back to where they had ended up, and indeed all they see is a heavily overgrown field that’s fenced off with several hazard signs placed all around where once that glamorous building stood. It’s then however when a police car pulls up and the same officer from the hospital steps out.

They make small talk at first, the protagonist once again explains their story and how they considers quitting that back and spirit breaking job. The officer actually laughs and says that he knows how it feels to be overworked.

Finally, however the protagonist asks how this orphanage claimed that all the children were accounted for and unharmed. The officer then sighs and says the reason why he was looking for the protagonist is because they’re not the first who claim to have seen something here, and he believes the people at the orphanage were lying. Several reports of mysterious children walking these grounds have been reported before, but likely thrown into the bin as prank calls..

The officer then says that he is actually a detective and has been doing this job for over ten years. One thing that the job taught him is the ability to sort out the truth from the lies, and he doesn’t believe the protagonist is crazy and may’ve seen something indeed.

It turns out that the orphanage had been closed down several years later after it was uncovered they had housed several children whom the staff illegally adopted from poor and underdeveloped countries, in order to boost their fundings. The orphanage also treated these children harshly and most lived in terrible condition.

The officer finishes off with saying that he wouldn’t be surprised if indeed some of the children didn’t make it out of that fire, but that they probably won’t be missed.
