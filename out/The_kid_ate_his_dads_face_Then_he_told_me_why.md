The corpse was missing its face. 

It’s an epidemic around here. A bad habit this town has with its murder-suicides.

It’s not enough for somebody to shove a knife through a ribcage and suck back on a 12 gauge anymore. No, now everybody has to be original. 

*Unique.* 

They’ve gotta peel off their victim’s face, then scarf it down like skin jerky before slashing their throats. 

Do you know how long it takes to bleed out after cutting your carotid artery?

Not long. 

Thirty seconds, maybe. 

A minute if you’re *really* unlucky. 

That’s not a lot of time to stage an arrest. To interrogate a murderer. To figure out why they killed their lover, their parents, their best friend. It’s not much time to parse through the mental quagmire that compels an individual to carve off a face and swallow it whole. 

It just isn’t. 

So I’ve had to make do. 

I’ve spent the last month digging through old case files and buried corpses. I’ve parsed the local folklore and researched the nearby legends. I’ve run a social media scan for sightings of anything supernatural, eerie, or otherwise batshit insane within a thirty mile radius — all to figure out what might be causing these cannibal suicides. 

And you know what I managed to find?

Nothing. 

Nadda. 

Zilch. 

. . .

Until tonight. 

See, I’ve had a breakthrough — an answered prayer. And it even has a name: 

Jonah. 

He’s seventeen years old. Bright. Studious. 

Captain of the football team. Head of the debate club. Chair of the student council for human rights and class valedictorian. Jonah’s not just a good kid, he's the kind that universities fight over.

Four days ago, he murdered his father.

Tore off the man’s face and chased it down with a glass of ginger ale, then slashed his own throat and dropped dead beside his old man.

Or at least, that was the plan. 

Unfortunately, as fantastic as Jonah was at everything else in life, he wasn’t much when it came to suicide. 

Lacked follow-through, you might say. 

The kid didn’t sever his jugular so much as dramatically nick it. Deep enough to pass out from blood loss, but shallow enough that the paramedics were able to salvage his life.  

And that was a mistake. 

Because now he’s all mine.

I’ve never cared much for hospitals. It’s a combination of the sterile fluorescents and the way the air smells like chemical warfare, the way everywhere you look it’s either more clutter or abject emptiness. 

Maybe that’s why Jonah looks so nervous when he sees me. 

It’s my expression. 

So bitter. So *repulsed*. 

It's hard not to feel this way. Hospitals make me think of my sister, and my sister makes me think of—

“Who are you?” Jonah croaks.

His voice sounds like he spent the evening gargling razor blades. He's lying in the bed like a mummy. Bandages strangle his throat. 

He asks the question again, and it sounds even more painful the second time around, but I still don’t answer.

We haven’t reached that stage in our relationship yet. 

Instead, I cross the room, unbutton my jacket, and drape it over the chair by his bed. Then I take a seat. All the while he's staring at me like I’m a hallucination, like nothing about me makes sense. 

It's understandable.

From Jonah's perspective, it's 10 in the evening. A stranger just walked into his hospital room wearing a black suit and a scowl, carrying the kind of briefcase that screams bad news. He probably thinks I’m here to audit his health insurance. That, or snatch his kidneys. 

But I’ve got worse things on my mind. 

I open my briefcase, shuffle through a handful of documents before finding my clipboard. The form attached is a standard 34-3A. An Interrogation Report, useful when determining an individual’s involvement in supernatural violence. 

My pen clicks. Scribbles Jonah’s name up top. 

He tries to speak again. Only manages to wheeze, which is fine because I’m not ready to chat just yet. 

My pen keeps scratching. Jotting down more observations. More data. I note the size of Jonah's pupils, his tangled brown hair, the way the corner of his mouth twitches in tune with his mounting dread. Then I fill in a dozen other fields: boiler-plate bullshit that’s too dull to describe. His age. Location.

“Are you—”  

Jonah winces. It probably feels like throwing up asphalt every time he speaks. 

He pushes through anyway. 

“Are you…with the police?” he manages. 

I pause, look up from my report, and meet his eyes. Just to let him know I see him. That I hear him. 

Then I go back to the report. 

Here’s the secret nobody tells you about conversations: it’s not about what you say, but what you don’t. The only thing more agonizing than being spoken to is being ignored. 

And right on schedule, silence works its black magic. Jonah starts to break. 

He lurches up in his bed, stiff and sore. Confused. Anxious. Hits the call button for his nurse. Once. Twice. Then he starts hammering it, only nobody is coming because I’m good at my job. 

Like I said, Jonah’s all mine. 

He tries to shout, but it’s so weak, so hoarse. Barely a rasp. “Nurse! Hello?”

The boy genius finally realized I’m not supposed to be here.

Good for him. 

I scratch out the last of his tombstone data, then clear my throat. 

Jonah’s voice dies. His gaze swivels, unease in his eyes.

“The nurse—”

“Isn't coming,” I tell him, clicking my pen and sliding it back into my shirt. “He went home early, so did security. It’s just you and me tonight.”

Jonah’s lips are glued together, his mind blue-screening as he tries to calculate just what it is I’m doing here. “But I already told the detectives everything I know.”

“I’m aware. I’m here to ask you questions of my own.”

His eyes narrow, suspicion blooming in his voice. “Who are you exactly?”

I loosen the tie around my collar. “I’m not much for names, personally. Suffice it to say that I work for an organization that’s taken an interest in your situation. It’s a private enterprise. Off the books. We call ourselves the Order of Alice.”

His brows furrow. "Never heard of it."

"That's the idea."

“So then… you’re *not* a cop?” 

The way he says the words is like he wants to believe them, but can’t. 

I lean forward, cutting my volume to a whisper. “No, kid. I’m the guy you call when the monster under your bed needs to be euthanized.”

Jonah’s heart monitor slows. 

I just told the kid that monsters are real; that our whole reality is a carefully constructed sham, and instead of panicking, he’s breathing a sigh of relief. 

I’d call that unusual. 

A cough rattles from my throat. Wet. Nasty. The kind that sounds like I'm not just spitting up phlegm, but years of my life.  

I could be so lucky.

“What are you looking for?” Jonah asks. 

I fish in my jacket, pull out a pack of cigarettes. Slip one between my lips. “Medicine.”

For a second, the kid looks like he might tell me you can't smoke in here. Try his hand at a lecture. Then he spots the gun at my hip, thinks better of it.

Like I said, Jonah's smart. 

“You told the cops that you didn’t murder your father,” I say, lighting the cigarette on fire. “You said it was someone else — some*thing* else. That right?"

He nods, or as close as he can manage with all the gauze around his neck. “Is that why you’re here… because you actually believe me?” 

His voice is two parts hopeful, one part desperate. 

“Sure,” I tell him. “I believe you.”

He falls back on his pillows, pimple-face softening with relief. “Thank God. Nobody else does. The way the detectives were talking sounded like they were angling for first-degree murder. Life in prison sorta thing.”

I cough up a stormcloud. “You’re not going to prison, kid.”

“You think they’ll acquit me?”

I laugh. 

Not on purpose—scout’s honor. It’s just that I can’t help myself.

“God no. If this state had the death penalty, you’d skip the line three times over.” 

Another drag. 

Another stormcloud. 

Jonah finds his voice, or what's left of it. “Then why did you just tell me that—”

“You won’t end up in prison because by the end of tonight, you won't exist.”

The implication hangs in the air like a guillotine. The kid shrinks. His arms wrap around himself, protective, horrified. He thinks I'm talking about the monster coming for reprisals. 

“You're innocent,” I tell him. “I'd almost guarantee it. Same as all the other murder-suicide victims in this nowhere town. Like you, they were just an audience to their nightmares, no different than my sister.”

He blinks. “Your sister?”

Christ.

There goes my motormouth.

“What happened to your sister?” he presses. 

Kid won't drop it. Figures. 

“Same thing that happened to you, only she didn’t botch the suicide.” I heave a sigh, ashing my cigarette onto the floor. “That’s why I’m so interested in your case. It's personal. I’d like to know the name of the monster that stole my sister from me.”

The kid gulps. His eyes unfocus with the sort of detached dread that makes the thousand-yard stare look nearsighted. “I can’t tell you its name,” he whispers. “I’m sorry.”

“Sure you can.”

“No, you don’t understand. All of this started the second I learned that thing’s name. If I speak it. If you hear it, then—”

“It’ll come for me next.”

I lean forward, look him in the eyes. “I’ve been doing this job for a long time, Jonah.  Too long. Hunting monsters. Purging legends. I’ve done my research, so I know that I’m putting my life on the line hearing its name, and that’s sort of the point.”

Jonah studies me. “You make it sound like you *want* to die.”

I crush the smoke on the armrest. Hack another cough. "I don’t get a say in the matter. Doc figures I’ve got another year in me, assuming I kick the habit. A few months if I don’t. You can do the math on that yourself.”

His expression falls. “Shit. I'm so sorry. My mother died of leukemia too…”

I glance at the clock: 10:35 PM.

Time to pick up the pace. 

“I’m not looking for sympathy, kid. I’m trying to tell you I know the stakes, that I’m dead whether I like it or not, so there’s nothing you’re protecting me from.”

“You don’t get it,” he sputters. “This thing doesn’t just make you kill yourself, it makes you kill—”

“I already know all that. What I need from you is its name.”

He sucks back a breath, grimacing. He’s having a crisis of conscience, battling his own morals. He doesn’t think I know what I’m getting into, that he can save me some suffering if only he keeps his big mouth shut. 

But I don’t have time for heroics. 

“Jonah,” I growl. “You have the chance to save *lives* here. To prove your *innocence*. Right now, your father died for *nothing*. Tell me that name, and I can make his death count for something.”

And there it is, the final twist of the knife. Like most boys his age, Jonah can’t help but want to do good by his father, to chase daddy's validation even while he's buried six feet in the dirt.  

"Okay,” he rasps.

His eyes find mine.Haunted. Hollow. 

Then his lips start to move, and each syllable sounds sweeter than the last. He gives what I’ve been searching for. The monster that destroyed my family — that stole my sister. He gives me the key to unlock the gates of hell, and it’s called:

“Zipperjaw.”

I scratch it down on my clipboard in haphazard scrawl, and sure enough, the name vanishes as soon as the ink forms. That’s a bullseye. A bingo. 

I smile like a maniac.

Can’t help it. 

Thirty years. That’s how long I’ve been searching for my sister’s reaper. It’s what led me to the Order of Alice, but after so many dead ends, I’d all but given up hope.

But now that I had one foot in the grave? It finally showed itself. 

Here. 

In this backwater town, carving off people’s faces, slashing their throats. It’s almost like it lured me, pulled me back for one last dance before I closed my book for good. 

My hand, my whole arm, is shaking. Tremoring. 

I’m *afraid.*

How long has it been since the last time I was truly, honestly *afraid*?

“Oh god,” Jonah mutters, burying his face in his hands. “I shouldn’t have done that. You seem like a good person.”

I glance up, my smile fracturing. 

The kid’s really gonna turn on the waterworks and ruin the moment.

“It’s fine,” I tell him curtly. “I already told you, I’m a dead man walking regardless.”

But Jonah lowers his hands, takes an ugly breath. Tears stream from his eyes. “You don’t get it,” he tells me weakly. “Once you know its name, Zipperjaw doesn’t just kill you. It finds the person you care most about and forces you to slaughter them. Just like… Just like…”

“What happened to your father,” I finish. 

The look in his eyes is so honest-to-god guilty. He feels awful. Terrible. 

He’s probably imagining my kids dying, or my parents, or grandparents, or a childhood friend. He’s probably imagining Zipperjaw forcing me to kill some innocent bystander, just like it forced him to kill his father, and it’s tearing him up inside. 

“I’m a monster,” he whimpers. 

“No, you’re a good kid, Jonah. I’m the monster.”

He blinks through a sheet of tears. He doesn’t understand. Not yet.

But he will. 

“It's like this,” I tell him. “I'm a pretty bitter guy. Angry. Resentful. Most women are smart enough to avoid me, which means I haven’t got any kids. No spouse. My parents were abusive enough that if my sister hadn’t beaten me to the punch, I’d have probably killed them myself.”

“Jesus,” Jonah says, guilt fading into sympathy. 

“I know, I know. I’m trauma dumping. I’ve never really figured out the trick to following social norms—to understanding conversational boundaries.” 

I gnaw my lip, fingers dancing on the armrest. 

“My therapist calls it sociopathy. Or maybe it was psychopathy? It’s hard to remember. Haven’t got the DSM handy to compare.”

Jonah’s eyes start to narrow, his compassion slowly evaporating. Piece by piece, the puzzle is forming in his mind.

“The point I’m trying to make is that I don’t have attachments to things. Not in the way you do. The closest I come to feeling a sense of connection is probably through my work.” I chuckle, shaking my head. “You might say I’m married to my job.”

Jonah swallows. 

“Zipperjaw killed my sister,” I tell him, a smile carving a path across my face. “The one person I ever truly cared about. And now? There’s nothing I cherish more than the thought of ripping it to pieces, and the way I get to do that is through you, Jonah.”

I plant my hands on my knees, eyes wild. “That means I need your story. It means I need to know what happened the night you ate your father’s face. And I need it all—every last detail.”

The heart monitor starts to scream. 

Jonah tries to lurch from his bed, but I shoot from my seat. Shove him down. 

“Let me go!” he rasps. “Get off!”

Like I said, Jonah’s a smart kid. 

He’s finally piecing it together, recognizing the nightmare unfolding before him. Only I can’t risk any miscommunication. Not while midnight is just an hour away — and Zipperjaw with it. 

I press my finger against his jugular. Not hard. Just hard enough that he stops fighting and starts cooperating. 

“You get it now, don't you?” I ask him. 

He's shaking like trapped livestock. His eyes dart to the clock on the wall. 11:12 PM. 

“It's you,” I say quietly, my face inches from his. “Right now, nobody in the entire world is more important to me than you are.”

His jaw tenses. It’s all crashing down on him now — the horror of what he’s done — of what I’ve done *to* him. 

But it wasn’t personal. 

Honest. 

It’s just that I needed him motivated, focused. I needed a surefire way to push past the kid’s trauma and get to the core of his experience. That meant he had to have some skin in the game. 

“You asshole,” Jonah snarls, voice dripping with contempt and disbelief. “You *used* me.”

“Occupational hazard. Sorry, kid.”

I reach for my clipboard, slip my pen from my shirt pocket. 

“Facts are facts: people are dying in this town. They're killing their loved ones. Carving off faces. Just the same way my sister did. And I have to know why, Jonah. I have to know why Zipperjaw does this.”

*I have to know why it took my Adelaide from me.*

He recoils, disgusted. “You actually think your sister would be okay with this? Sacrificing people to satisfy your little revenge fantasy?”

He's staring daggers at me, the sort I probably deserve. A kid like him, he's got dreams. A whole life ahead of him, and not the bad kind either. 

But so did my sister.

Adelaide never deserved her nightmare.  

“My sister's dead,” I tell him, pushing the memory from my mind. “This isn't about what she would want. It's about what I *need*. It's about making Zipperjaw pay for what it took from me.”

My pen clicks. Stabs the clipboard like a knife.

"You know as well as I do what happens at midnight, Jonah. So I'd start talking—or pretty soon you won't have a face to talk with."
