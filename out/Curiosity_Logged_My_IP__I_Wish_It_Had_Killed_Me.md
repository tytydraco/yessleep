I never wanted to go anywhere near the Dark Web.

I know that sounds dramatic, but I mean it literally. I was the kind of person who avoided true crime documentaries because they made it harder to sleep. I put tape over my laptop webcam. I still covered my phone camera with my thumb when I wasn’t using it. I wasn’t paranoid, I was cautious. There’s a difference.

My friends, on the other hand, thought fear was funny.

It started on a Friday night, the kind where no one had real plans but everyone pretended they did. We were crammed into Mark’s basement, five of us total, surrounded by empty soda cans, stale chips, and the low hum of his gaming PC. It was raining outside, the kind of steady rain that makes the windows look like they’re melting.

Someone, I think it was Ethan, brought up the Dark Web as a joke.

“Bro,” he said, spinning in Mark’s desk chair, “you know there are literal hitmen sites down there, right? Like, you can just order someone.”

Mark snorted. “That’s bullshit.”

“It’s not,” Ethan insisted. “I saw a video. You can buy organs, guns, people”

“Most of that’s fake,” I said, without looking up from my phone. “Scam sites and edgy roleplay.”

That was my mistake.

Ethan grinned at me. “Ohhhh, so you know about it.”

“I know of it,” I corrected. “That’s different.”

Mark leaned back in his chair, arms crossed. “You scared?”

“No.”

Another mistake.

He turned his monitor toward us. “I’ve got Tor installed.”

I laughed. I actually laughed, because I thought he was joking. Mark liked to exaggerate. But when he clicked open a browser I didn’t recognize, dark purple icon, onion symbol, my stomach tightened.

“Dude,” I said, finally paying full attention. “Why do you even have that?”

Mark shrugged. “College class. Cybersecurity elective.”

“Sure,” Ethan muttered.

“Let’s look something up,” Mark said, fingers hovering over the keyboard. “Just to see.”

I shook my head. “I don’t want to.”

“Come on,” said Jess, who had been quiet until now. “You’re always talking about how everything’s fake. Prove it.”

I didn’t realize it then, but that sentence would loop in my head for months.

“Fine,” I said. “But if we see something illegal, I’m out.”

Everyone agreed a little too quickly.

Mark typed slowly, theatrically. The Tor browser loaded pages at a crawl, each click taking long enough to make my skin itch. It wasn’t like normal browsing. It felt… heavy. Like every page resisted being opened.

Forums first. Message boards filled with nonsense usernames and walls of text. Most of it looked stupid. People arguing about crypto. Conspiracy theories. Fake IDs for sale.

I relaxed a little.

“See?” I said. “Nothing.”

Then Ethan leaned over Mark’s shoulder. “Search for something real.”

Mark hesitated. “Like what?”

Ethan looked at me. “You decide.”

I should have said no.

Instead, trying to be cool, I said the first thing that came to mind. “I don’t know. Something creepy.”

Mark started typing on the computer. And ended up searching ”Kills streams”

The page took longer than usual to load.

When it finally did, the room went quiet.

It wasn’t flashy. No blood. No jump scares. Just a plain black page with white text and a list of links. Titles that didn’t explain themselves, but didn’t need to.

“Holy shit,” Jess whispered.

One link caught my eye immediately. I don’t know why. It was simple. Too simple.

WATCHING ROOM

“That’s fake,” I said automatically.

“Click it,” Ethan said.

“No.”

“Click it.”

Before I could stop him, Mark did.

The site loaded faster than the others. That should have been my second warning.

The page showed a single embedded video window. No thumbnail. No description. Just a gray “LIVE” indicator in the corner.

“This is fake,” I said again, louder.

The video buffer wheel spun.

Then it started.

At first, I thought it was a basement. Concrete walls. A single hanging bulb swinging slightly. The camera angle was high, like it was mounted in a corner.

A man sat in the center of the room on a metal chair.

He was breathing hard.

“Is this… staged?” Jess asked.

The man looked up at the camera.

And spoke.

“I know you’re watching,” he said.

Not screaming. Not crying. Calm. Too calm.

“I don’t know how many of you there are,” he continued. “But you found this room. That means it’s started.”

I felt cold all over.

“This is a recording,” Mark said, but his voice wasn’t confident.

The man swallowed. “They said if I talk, they’ll end it faster.”

Ethan laughed nervously. “This is some ARG bullshit.”

The man’s eyes shifted, like he was tracking something off-camera.

“Please,” he said suddenly, panic cracking his voice. “If anyone recognizes me”

Suddenly another man entered the room, the guy on the chair screamed at the top of his lungs and then…

The video cut.

The page refreshed.

A new video loaded.

Different room. Same camera angle. Same lighting.

Different person.

This one was a woman. Younger. Her face was bruised. One eye swollen shut.

Jess covered her mouth.

“Turn it off,” she said.

“No,” Ethan whispered. “Wait.”

The woman didn’t speak. She just stared at the camera, tears sliding silently down her face.

A timer appeared at the bottom of the screen.

02:59

And began counting down.

“Okay, that’s enough,” I said, standing up. “This is sick.”

The timer hit 02:30.

The woman shook her head frantically.

“Mark,” Jess said. “Please.”

Mark’s hands hovered over the mouse. “I can’t— it’s frozen.”

The timer hit 02:00.

The woman screamed.

Suddenly the same man came out from the door behind her with a drill. ”I want the best for all of you. I hope you’ll enjoy the show” he said with a distorted voice.

He put the drill to her swollen eye and began drilling into it. The blood pooling out made my stomach turn, and the screams and grunts the woman was uttering scarred me deep inside.

He stopped after a while, then he changed the position of the drill to her throat and began drilling deep. Blood sprayed out of the hole the guy was drilling through each time the woman tried to speak, scream or cry.

After a while of drilling, the woman started choking on her own blood. And eventually everything went quiet.

The screen went black at 00:30.

The page refreshed again.

YOU BOYS DONT BELONG HERE.

Underneath, in smaller text:

GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE ADULTS WEBSITE.

We didn’t speak for a full minute.

Then Ethan laughed too loudly. “Okay. That’s fake as hell.”

I grabbed my jacket. “I’m leaving.”

No one tried to stop me.

I barely slept that night.

The next morning, my phone buzzed with a notification.

A private message from an account I didn’t recognize.

I opened it and saw a link to another livestream. I opened it and saw Ethan, Jess and Mark. They were tied up. Jess’s throat was slut wide opened and stuffed with yellow candy. Ethan wasn’t awake, but Mark alive but bruised sat crying beside Jess.

Suddenly i heard faint footsteps from the hallway. As the idiot i was, i grabbed a baseball bat i had in my room and slowly made my way out of my room.

The hallway was dark and quiet. Suddenly a towel was pressed against my face, and i passed out in merely seconds.

I woke up later, stuck to a chair. Across from me, was my friends. I cried out loud when suddenly the same man from the earlier livestreams walked up to me. He held the same drill. ”You have been a dirty little boy. Haven’t you?” He asked.

He then threw my head back against the chair. ”And bad boys need to learn” he pressed the drill towards my chest. ”Schhh, this is just gonna hurt like hell”

He turned it on. I could feel the intense pain followed by the warm red blood dripping down my chest. I screamed, at the top of my lungs. He continued in, i felt one of my ribs break and i screamed even louder.

The man seemed to really enjoy this moment untill he suddenly stopped. ”Egh, fuck!” He grunted as he ripped out the drill from me. He placed the drill on the floor next to me. He grabbed my hair and made me look at him. ”I’ll be right back peasent. Forgot to entertain the wiewers” he threw my head back and walked away into the dark.

I sat down and cried out loud for a while as i looked over at my dead friends. Jess was left like i last saw her on the live sent to me. Ethan, or what was left of him was sprawled out on the floor. Almost looked like someone tried washing away his remains. Mark was the worst part though, he was barely still alive.

He was nailed up on the wall. His both eyes were drilled out, his ribcage was wide open, his lungs, organs and heart were visable, his legs had been scraped off with a knife from the kneecaps, and his face was burnt and stiched together. 

It was impressive how he was even still alive.

I knew that if I wanted to make it out of this alive, I had to act fast.
I was losing blood, fast enough that my vision kept dimming at the edges, like someone was slowly turning down the lights. 

Every heartbeat felt heavier than the last. Warmth soaked into my clothes, and I didn’t need to look down to know how bad it was.

Tears streamed down my face even faster than the blood. Not just from the pain, but from the thought of Lizz, my girlfriend, still completely unaware of what was happening to me. 

Unaware that I might already be dead by the time anyone came looking. That we might all be gone.

That my friends and I would just… disappear.

No answers. No closure.

That my family would never get the relief of knowing what happened to me, only unanswered phone calls and a missing person report collecting dust.

I couldn’t let that happen.

Something inside me snapped. The fear turned into something else, raw, burning fury. My chest felt tight, my jaw clenched so hard it hurt. That’s when I noticed it.

The drill.

He must have dropped it in his rush. It lay on the floor just inches out of reach, smeared with something dark and sticky. My stomach twisted.

My hands and legs were strapped tightly to the chair, the ropes biting into my skin, but adrenaline drowned out the pain. I threw my weight forward as hard as I could. The chair tipped, crashed onto its side, and I hit the floor.

Hard.

For a second, the pain nearly knocked the air out of me. But luck, pure, stupid luck, had me falling just close enough. My fingers brushed plastic. I grabbed the drill and pulled it toward me like my life depended on it.

Because it did.

I pressed the spinning bit against the ropes around my wrists, praying the sound wouldn’t carry. The drill whined softly as the fibers began to fray. My arms screamed in pain, my hands shaking, but I didn’t stop. One rope snapped. Then another.

When I finally tore myself free, I didn’t hesitate.
I bolted through the opposite door, the one the masked man had disappeared through earlier.

I ran.

I ran and ran and ran, my bare knees slamming against the ground, my lungs burning, every breath scraping my throat raw. I didn’t know where I was going. I just knew I couldn’t stop.

Somehow, I found a window.
I didn’t think. I didn’t slow down. I crashed straight through it.
Glass exploded around me, and then I was falling.

Two stories.

I hit the ground wrong. I heard it before I felt it, a sickening crack. Pain erupted up my leg, sharp and blinding. My ankle was shattered. I knew it instantly.
But it didn’t matter.

I screamed and dragged myself upright, limping, stumbling, half-running through the agony. Fear drowned out everything else.
The house we had been kidnapped to sat deep in the forest. And as insane as it sounds, I recognized it. Years ago, I had camped nearby with my family. I remembered the trails. 

The slope of the land. Which direction led back to civilization.
I followed that memory like a lifeline.
When I finally reached the road, when I saw houses in the distance, lights glowing faintly, i collapsed.

I don’t remember hitting the ground.
Days later, I woke up in a hospital bed.

Alive.

Safe.

But barely.

Pain screamed through my body, my foot, my ribs, my head. Tubes and wires surrounded me. The room smelled like antiseptic and stale air.

And sitting right beside me was Lizz.
The moment my eyes opened, she screamed my name.

“BABY!”

She burst into tears, sobbing so hard she could barely breathe. She hugged me before I could stop her, and I groaned in pain as my ribs protested.

“WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!” she cried. “WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?!”

I tried to speak, but my throat closed. Tears spilled down my face.

“Mark… Jess… Ethan…” I whispered. “They’re all dead…”

She pulled back, staring at me like I’d lost my mind.

“What? What the hell are you saying?” she asked, her voice shaking.

After that, everything went blurry.

I only know that months later, I was finally released from the hospital. I told the police everything. Every detail I could remember.
My story went viral.

You’re probably expecting an anticlimax, something like “No bodies were found. The killers vanished. The case went cold.”
But no.

The police searched the abandoned warehouse where we had been kept.

Mark’s body was still there.

So were Ethan’s.

And Jess’s.

They found a camera. Tools. A mask.

Two years later, five men were arrested.
Drug dealers.

They admitted everything.

They confessed to killing my three friends.
And to trying to kill me too.

Sometimes people ask me how I survived.
I don’t have an answer.

I just know that I was supposed to die in that room.

And i just know that it couldn’t have been that easy. They let me escape. They wanted me to escape.

Because i think they aint done with me. But im not done with them either.
