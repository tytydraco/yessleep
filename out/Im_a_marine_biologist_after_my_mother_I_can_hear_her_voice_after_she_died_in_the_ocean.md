My mother was a deep sea marine biologist, I remember always waiting for her to come back from her trips. She would volunteer to test the experimental submarines because she had a passion to discover and explore. I remember when I was fourteen, my father walked through the door and he was clearly crying.
He put his hand on my shoulder and spoke to me in a seldom voice.

"Son, mom has passed away.. She went on one of the expiriment trips and the sub had a malfunction, it collapsed on itself and sank to the bottom.."

My father spoke through tears, at the moment I couldn't say anything. I stared at the floor with wide eyes before asking one question.

"..Was she in pain?"

More tears began to fall, he shook his head.

"No, when it collapsed it killed her in an instant.. When I talked to her coworkers her last words on the radio were her saying to tell us not to worry. She died doing her passion, and now she can explore the sea in spirit."

It was oddly comforting to hear that, but from that day on I wanted to hold on to every memory I had of her. I grabbed an old camera out of my father's room and found a video of her singing me a lullaby that she put me to sleep with every night as a kid.

"Goodnight sweet child, its time to go to bed. Don't worry now, its time to rest your head. When morning comes, we can get up to play, but for right now it's the end of the day."

Her voice harmonized with every word she sang, I watched myself slowly go to sleep as the song ended. I listened to that lullaby every night, it soothed me when I cried for her as well as helped me sleep.
When I graduated high school, I took college classes in oceanography, biostatistics, marine chemistry, ecosystems and geology. I spent time in college for four years before I got my first job at the same company my mother worked at.

When the interviewer looked at me and seen my name, she had a look of empathy.

"Youre Mia's son.. She talked so kindly of you."

I smiled in response and the next half of the interview was talking about my mother. 

My first trip in a submarine was with a group of five people. I've been working in the company for five years before I volunteered to go on expiriment trips.
The reason I waited so long is after her death, they stopped accepting any trips and would put animals in them instead of humans.

 The first one I did worked more than perfect, we have only discovered five percent of the ocean and it was my goal to discover more. I played it safe, going down slowly and exploring and setting the sub's camera to take pictures of the different plants and animals. The plants that looked nice to me, I would use the small hook attached to the machine and would take it to mh father if it was safe.
Every time I found something, I would go back go my childhood home and suprise my father with them. Since I reminded him of my mother it bought him closure, and to have something to care about he adopted a pitbull puppy that was abused by its past owners. I'm glad to say that my father is having a happy ending too, and I'll continue to help him.

I worked for six more years, I've tried about eleven expiriment trips and was now on my twelfth. This was used to go beyond every point that any other submarine went, and was being worked on well before I started there. I got into it and began to go underwater, passing everything I seen.
I watched the ocean water get darker and darker for every yard I went down until it was pitch black. My progress was being recorded, they had a camera in every section of the subarine so they could communicate with me. As I went down, every word they said got increasingly incoherent.

"Brooks!.. The pipe's!.."

As the words were yelled it faded into static. I was unable to get up to check because of the difficulty to control the submarine as it went through a strong current.
After about five minutes of silence, I heard something from outside of the sub.

"Goodnight sweet child... its time to go to bed. Don't worry now, its time to rest your head. When morning comes... we can get up to play, but for right now it's the end of the day."

My mother's voice sang, the voice was somehow mangled but obvious it was her. I was confused. Memories of her flooded back and I went deeper.

As I finally heard the message they were trying to send, pipes bursted in the submarine and made a harmful gas when they combined. I used the submarines last bit of Hotspot to tell my story before I go to the inevitable.

I'm glad my mother comforted me one last time.
