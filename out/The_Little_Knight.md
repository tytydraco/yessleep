It was early September of 1961, just a few miles out from the east shore of Lake Pontchartrain. We were on a noble quest, a “knight's errand” as Bobby put it. He was always the smarter of us, the reader who liked to tell his baby brother scary stories in the dark where heroes would face great evils. Sometimes they won, and sometimes they didn’t.

Bobby was my older brother by five years. 

He was all I had.

We were forced to live with our Uncle after our parents died in a house fire just two years before, and our lives had taken a turn. We’d always been poor, but living with our Uncle was a new level of poverty and neglect that we had never known. I still got some rough spots on my ass end that built up underneath my Uncle’s switch.

He was the opposite of our old man, and there wasn’t even a lesser shadow of our perfect mother to take her place. There was only our uncle and his switch and his drink.

As far back as I can remember, there were always stories of a witch who lived far beyond town out in the sticks. Stories of the Swamp Woman who would grant a wish and give you anything you wanted if you passed her awful test. Of course, no one ever did. Bobby heard them stories too. One late afternoon we set out upon the swamp after our Uncle had fallen deep under the spell of his whiskey.

We rode our rusted old bicycles to the end of Louis road and hoofed it the rest of the way through the cypress trees, up a winding path full of bugs and snakes and mud.

It started pouring rain just before the shack came into view through the trees.  It was a slapdash affair with mismatched mossy boards and a metal roof. We could hear the rain pounding down on it before it even came into view.

It sat at the edge of a fetid bog. There were a couple of windows on the front of it with some of the panes missing. A couple of badly preserved hogs heads were on either side of the front door, just rotting and falling apart in that thick Louisiana air.

A single rocking chair was on the porch. It was unlike anything else outside of, or within the shack. It was of a deep red wood, and it was polished to a high shine. It looked like something a Queen would have been proud of to sit on.

The one thing I remember that stuck out most were the stilts the shack sat on. Girthy timbers that held strong on the ground with several other pieces of wood splayed out on the bottoms. It looked like a bunch of chicken legs was holding it up.

The rotten steps up to her porch gave under our muddy sneakers and they groaned for mercy; crying out for help. Somewhere, out in the thick of that swamp, something answered that cry back.

Me and Bobby froze. We had never heard an animal call like that before. We didn’t know what it was, but it’s still to this day, the most awful, terrifying shriek I ever heard.

Only the sound of a fire cracking in a pot bellied stove snapped us back into the moment, and when we turned, she was standing in the doorway staring at us. A gnarled old woman with skin like shoe leather and the whitest teeth I’d ever seen. I took a step behind my big brother. She scared me.

It went like this. Just like the stories we heard.

Bobby offered her his most cherished possession, and in return, she gave him the opportunity to take her test. If he won her game, he got his wish. If he lost, she kept his item and something terrible would befall Bobby, although we weren’t sure at the time what that meant. All the stories we had heard left that terribleness up to the imagination. Come to find out, it was worse than I could’ve known.

Bobby held out his Mickey Mouse doll he got the Christmas before I was born.

My Uncle made fun of him for keeping that thing, said he took it as evidence for him being queer, and beat him for it time and again. Bobby swore it still smelled like our old house. He would have taken a thousand beatings before he gave that thing up. I watched him hand it over into the arthritic claws of that old witch. I watched her close those long nails around Mickey’s face and almost cried.

“How old are you, boy?” Her voice sounded broken and her every breath was a tired wheeze. I strained to hear her over the driving rain on that metal roof.

“I’m fourteen, Mamm.” 

“You know, you face death if you fail, don’t ya?”

“Yes Mam.” My brother had no idea what those words meant and neither did I. He was brave because he didn’t realize what he was agreeing to.

“What is it you want?”

“I want my parents back.”

“I can only do one miracle at a time.” She smiled wide and I noticed that one of her bottom teeth was missing. A tiny black hole in that otherwise perfect smile. “Pick one or the other.”

Bobby looked down at the floor and then he looked back to me. I could read it in his face that he felt he’d be betraying one or the other. As for me, I would’ve picked my Momma. I told Bobby that our Daddy would be just fine in heaven by himself for a little longer, and that he would understand why we would pick Momma over him. That seemed to make sense to Bobby and he nodded at me before he turned back to the witch.

“I want my Momma back.”

That witch just smiled at Bobby and then she ushered us into that nasty old shack.

Books and books. Moldy old books that reeked. Several cats were inside and the smell of their piss made it hard to breathe. There were some shelves filled with odd knick knacks alongside one of the walls. A small family picture, a bible, a baseball card, a fishing reel,all kinds of things. It was on one of these shelves that she placed Bobby’s stuffed Mickey.

There was a single door in the back of the shack and she led us through it.

Inside was only three things. A chair in the middle of the tiny room and a small table sitting a few feet from it with a cracked metronome sitting on top of it. There was no roof sitting on the four walls of this room. The rain was just pouring down inside.

“Sit.”

I watched the floorboards bow under Bobby as he walked to the chair and sat down. The witch followed him. There were straps on the armrests and legs just like in those pictures I had seen of electric chairs, and the witch tightened them on my brother after he sat down.

“Watch this and only this.” That old metronome started clicking under her touch. 

“What’s going to happen?”

“That’s up to you. If your mind and your courage hold up, you’ll get what you want. I suppose either way, you’ll be seeing your Momma real soon.” She let out a terrible laugh as she pushed me out of the room and closed the door on my brother. I told him I loved him, and he said the same back to me.

We walked out onto the porch and she plopped down on that ornate rocking chair, lit up a pipe, and just stared at me while she rocked back and forth. All those cats sat around her. They were staring at me as well. It was almost dark.

The rhythm of her rocking matched the clicking of that metronome that I could barely hear behind the closed door inside. The rain let up, and the fireflies were starting to come out. Her and those cats just stared at me. She was enjoying my fear. 

I started to ask her how long my brother would be in there, but she put her finger to her lips and told me to hush and listen.

The sound of that metronome got louder along with the groaning boards from the porch under the weight of her chair. I heard that awful animal out in the woods again, but this time, it was answered by another call of the same.

And then another.

And another.

The woods came alive with sounds that still give me nightmares. The sounds surrounded me in the dying light of that evening. That’s when Bobby started to cry out.

He was wailing in pain behind that old door and I rushed inside to try and help him while the old witch just sat in that chair and rocked. There was no lock on the door, but for some reason it just wouldn’t open. 

I tried and tried and I begged God to help me and my brother. Bobby was screaming for help, but there was nothing I could do but cry.

I ran back out onto the porch and begged the old woman to let my brother out of that room. She just smiled and puffed on that pipe.

Then there was nothing but the sound of the metronome. The forest had gone quiet. Bobby had gone quiet. The fireflies were everywhere. The wind picked up and the moss hanging from the trees started to dance against it.

The old woman put down her pipe and took her time standing up. Then she walked back inside and I followed.

She opened the door.

Bobby was still sitting in the chair with his eyes wide open, but he wasn’t moving. He looked afraid.

“He’s with your Momma now.”

I ran to Bobby, but she was right. He was gone. His skin was blue and he wasn’t breathing. His eyes were full of tears and a thin trail of blood ran from his mouth. She pushed me out of the way and loosened the straps on the chair. I watched her heave my brother’s lifeless body over her crooked shoulder.

She walked out of the shack and off the porch. All I could do was follow. She walked over to the edge of the bog and heaved my brother into the muddy water. The shrieks from the forest returned. A greedy, hungry sound that I imagine came from hell itself.

I watched Bobby slowly sink as she left me there on my knees at the bank. I was alone.

After a good long sob, I walked back over to the trail we had walked in on. I looked back over my shoulder and saw the witch just rocking on her porch and smoking her pipe in the darkness. Her cats all perched on the rails of the porch with their glowing eyes fixed on me.

I stared back down the trail and I thought about what my brother said. “We” were on a knight’s errand.

I slid my hand into my pocket and felt something I always carried with me. A small whistle that my Daddy had carved from the cypress next to our old house. The only thing I had left.

I knew I’d never see my parents again in this life. I accepted it. But I couldn’t leave without my brother.

I took out the whistle and put it to my lips and I blew as hard as I could. The forest fell silent, as if the sound of that whistle scared away all the evil things out in the darkness.

I walked back to the shack. The witch wasn’t rocking anymore. I walked up the steps and I held my whistle forward.

“How old are you, boy?”

“I’m nine, Mamm.” 

“You know, you face death if you fail, don’t ya?”

“Yes Mam.” I knew what those words meant. I knew full well what I was agreeing to.

“What is it you want?”

“I want my brother back.”

-

Bobby would tell me later that he saw our parents for just a moment before he came back to me. They were crying and told him that they were fine and they wished he had just moved on and lived a long life. That they were going to see him further down the road anyway. 

I suppose he’s with them again. I lost him to a stroke last year. I rest easy at night, knowing that I’ll see them all again someday, along with everyone else I’ve lost. 

Life is good and meant to be lived without looking back, because what comes after it will be, no matter [what](https://www.reddit.com/r/tinyhorribles/).
