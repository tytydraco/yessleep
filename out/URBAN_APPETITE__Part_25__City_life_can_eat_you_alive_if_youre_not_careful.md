&#x200B;

We stood in the alleyway by the Foundry, trying to gather our shattered wits with the other survivors after the venue caved in. We’d all pulled out our phones, but nothing worked. No signal could be found. Even emergency calls failed. Someone tried to do a satellite connection but it failed just like everything else. Given the street lights, the power grid was still on despite all the buildings caving in from the inside out, but we were completely cut off.

A little girl cried in the arms of her father. “It’s gonna be okay,” he said to her in that gentle paternal tone, stroking her hair as he held her. I caught his eye and I could tell he didn’t believe his own words.

“I knew I should have just stayed at home,” growled some dumpy-looking bearded man.

“This… this can’t… this can’t…” fretted a young woman, pacing back and forth as her friend tried to calm her down.

MORE.

That dead voice cut through our worries, making us all freeze up. The same voice that had preceded this entire disaster. We all shut our mouths, even the little girl reducing her cries to whimpers as she buried her face in her father’s shirt.

The seven of us stood stock still for a moment, growing more aware that the cries and screams and shrieks of those trapped in those pits were fading into the night. We moved closer together in the darkness of the alleyway, sharing looks with each other as if any one of us would have the answers we were all craving.

“Okay,” said Travis. “At least… At least we made it.”

“What do we do?” asked the father. “We gotta get home. We gotta get her mother.” He cradled his child against him.

“We definitely can’t stay here,” said Travis. “If we’re gonna make it, we gotta work together. I’m Travis, and this here is Steve.”

“Hi,” I said, sheepish shyness weighing on me on top of everything else as they all turned to regard me.

“Roger,” said the father. “This is Vivi.”

“Sam,” said the bearded man.

“I… I’m Jess,” said the panicky woman. Her friend waved. “Annie.”

“Wish we could have met under better circumstances,” said Travis. “But at least we’re here and not in there.” He gestured to the Foundry; the sounds in the pit were completely gone now save a constant sizzling and bubbling. It seemed as soon as everyone in the venue had fallen into the pit, the building had stopped caving in on itself.

“We need to… We need to get out of this city as fast as humanly possible,” I said, forcing myself to talk even as I froze and paused.

“Not without her mother,” said Roger.

“I’m going back home and not leaving until this is over!” said Sam, his face almost jiggling with his disapproval of my suggestion.

“We can’t leave this city!” said Jess. Even Annie was shaking her head at me.

“Listen,” I said, forcing my words out. I stumbled over them trying to keep myself from stammering. “There’s something wrong with this city. It… cities don’t do this. It’s like it’s… actively trying to kill us. You hear that… that voice.”

“What, you think the city came to life and caused all this?” grumbled Sam.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I know as much as you all do. But… you have to admit something is wrong here. If we stay in the city… we’re going to die. All of us.” I looked at Roger and Vivi. “Once we’re out… we can get help. We can save your wife.” I turned to Sam. “We can… make sure going to your house is safe.” I faced Jess and Annie. “Stay… if you want. I’m leaving.” I ended with Travis. “If we stay, we die. Tell me I’m wrong.”

Travis shook his head. “Nope,” he said. “You said what was on my mind.” He looked back at the others. “If we head south, we can cut through the historical district and make it to the city limits. Hopefully once we get past them we’re safe.”

Sam sighed. “Fine,” he said. “I’m not going to my house alone.”

“I’m sure mama will be fine,” said Roger to his daughter. “She’ll stay nice and safe at home, okay?”

“Historical district,” said Jess. “That’s where the mayor is, right?”

“Yes,” said Travis. “We’ll swing by. If anyone is getting a hold on the situation, it’s Toomley.” He turned to me. “You okay with a detour to the historic city hall, Steve? If Toomley can help, we won’t have to cover nearly as much ground. It’s a long way to the city limits.”

I sighed. “Whatever keeps us alive,” I said, before gesturing to him. “Lead the way. I don’t know how to get around this city you have me trapped in.”

“You can rub this in once we’re out of here alive,” he said. “Stay close, everybody!”

Travis moved to the mouth of the alleyway as we clustered in behind him, looking around at the encroaching buildings lining the lit street. Not a car on the road, and no noise at all save the occasional crash and crumble echoing from somewhere else in the city. No dogs, no sirens, none of the usual sounds that should be present even with such a catastrophic disaster going on. No noise except the wind, which seemed to almost pulsate, coming and going.

We turned onto the street, heading south toward the historic city hall, so far off in the distance it might as well have been in St. Louis. We kept off the road and fanned out across the sidewalk, none of us knowing how to place ourselves. Was it safer to stay by the buildings where we could hide in shadows some? Could the streets cave in like the venue floor had? None of us knew, and no one had the same answer. I chose the buildings, doing my best to stay out of the streetlights. The windows in every structure felt like a series of eyeballs gazing down at me, sizing me up; at least at their walls I felt like I was traveling just under their noses.

As I was looking upward I spotted something at an intersection, plopped on one of the stoplights flashing red. I stopped the group and pointed it out to them: one of those little traffic cameras they use to extort speeding tickets out of civilians. I don’t like those things at the best of times, but after everything else this one made my skin crawl.

“Most of them are fake,” said Sam. “They’re just there to make you think they’re real, get you to slow down like sheep.”

“What if it’s real, though?” asked Jess. “Maybe someone’s alive at the police station! We should see if we can signal them! We could get help right away!” Annie paused, looking up at the camera with what started as optimism but faded to uncertainty.

“Do they check the feeds that often?” asked Travis. “My high school has cameras all over and I’m pretty sure the security guard just plays games on his phone all day. It’s probably better to just keep going.”

“No way it would be so easy,” I said. “Don’t let the cameras see you. I don’t think what’s looking on the other end is something that wants to help us.”

“Okay,” said Jess. “If all of you want to be dimwits, go ahead. I’m not staying alone out here any longer than I have to.” With that, she walked to the edge of the sidewalk despite Annie grabbing her by the arm. “Oh please, Annie. You can’t seriously want to go all the way to city hall in heels.” She broke free of her grip and moved out onto the street, Annie not daring to step onto the asphalt.

We all watched her move out onto the street, stepping into the center of the intersection before looking right at the traffic camera. “Hey!” she called, bouncing up and down and waving her arms. “We need help! Is anyone there? Please! We’re–”

The lights on the street all stopped flashing and turned green.

The asphalt underneath Jess caved in and she barely had time to let out a shriek as she fell down, vanishing into what had once been part of the sewer system. She landed hard on the edge of the walkway and fell into the center of the canal, struggling to pull herself back up by grabbing a fallen pipe, using it for leverage. As she did, though, the line burst, sending a torrent of water that knocked her off her feet and sent her sliding down the sloped waterway, disappearing into the depths of the city sewer system.

The camera swiveled around on a pivot I didn’t even know it had.

“It’s looking for us,” I gasped. “Run!”

“This way!” said Travis, taking off. I followed behind, the rest of the group chasing after us, Annie doing her best to stifle her sobs.

“What’s looking for us?” asked Sam. “The city? You can’t be serious.”

“It saw her through the camera,” I said. “It wasn’t until after she got its attention that… the street caved in and took her. And back at the Foundry… that place had to have had lots of cameras. Even if it didn’t, a venue like that would have lots of people.”

“Wait, you seriously do think the city itself is doing this?” asked Sam. “This is just some bizarre series of coincidences. They probably built this place on top of a network of caves that are finally collapsing.”

“Caves full of acid?” I asked.

“Acid?” asked Roger, huffing as he carried his daughter.

“Back at the Foundry,” said Travis. “After everyone fell into the pit, it started filling up with acid. That’s why they all died. Acid flowed in and dissolved them.”

“I saw no such thing,” said Sam, huffing even harder than the father carrying a child. “That wasn’t acid. Just dirty water you’re mistaking for acid. The people drowned or got crushed or choked on gas.”

“Being skeptical and being closed-minded are two different things,” I growled, feeling a stitch form in my side. “I know what I saw, and I trust my eyes more than you. Or am I to favor your insistence it can’t be because you think it’s absurd?”

“What a bunch of idiots,” mocked Sam. “Screw your plans. My place is nearby.” We came to the end of the street, stopping to catch our breath while looking at the lights of the intersection. Two more traffic cameras, swiveling about looking for us. Off on the other side of the street was an electronic billboard cycling through various ads.

“Don’t go off on your own,” said Travis. “You stick together in a crisis.” Annie shook her head, waving off Sam like trying to shoo away an insect. Even Roger didn’t look particularly desperate to keep the bearded man with us.

“Given what you and him apparently think, I’ll be quite fine on my own,” sneered Sam, moving to the intersection. “Just gotta time it when the cameras aren’t looking.” His puffy red face looked east. “Then it’s just a few miles to my home.”

“You won’t make a block,” I said.

“Says someone I’m surprised made it anywhere in life,” he retorted. He stared off in the distance. “Things are looking better for me already.”

Coming toward us was a single taxi cab, empty save for the driver. It coasted down the street, making as little noise as possible before cutting through the intersection practically on the corner of the crosswalk, slowing to a stop on the left side of the road, a mere twenty feet away from Sam. The passenger window rolled down, and the cab driver leaned our way. “Get off the street!” he hissed. “It’s dangerous out here!”

“Don’t have to tell me twice!” said Sam, moving toward the cab as he struggled to regain his breath.  “Come with me,” he said to Annie, Roger and Vivi. “We’ll fit. Let those two get themselves killed.”

My hairs stood up as I looked at the taxi cab, the driver waving to us. He looked normal, just your average person trying to make ends meet in an overpriced urban area.

I tried to think it through. Would whatever was causing this target vehicles? Almost everyone had been outside of their cars when disaster struck. It took Jess because she was out in the open. Could a car fool this… entity?

I shook my head at Roger and Annie. Roger looked at Vivi, arms wrapped around his neck, then at the car again. Annie looked to be thinking it over but made no move.

“Have fun dying,” said Sam, opening the door and squeezing himself into the backseat. “It’s your funeral, you morons.”

“Get off the street!” said the cab driver, in the same tone as before. “It’s dangerous out here!” He kept looking at us. In the same way he had before Sam had moved up to the cab.

“They heard you the first time,” said Sam. “Punch it! You can wait it out at my home with me.”

“Get off the streeet,” repeated the cab driver, what had been an identical tone distorting and falling as he somehow leaned so far ahead his face was out the passenger window. “It’s daaangeroouusss out heerree.”

Sam’s eyes widened and he shuffled himself around right when, in the dead silence of the streets, we all heard the audible click of the doors locking.

Even from this distance I could see Sam looking at the front seat in horror. What had once been a cab driver turned its head one-hundred-eighty degrees and moved it to the other window, then another ninety to look at Sam. “Get oooffff the streeeeet,” it growled like a winding-down record. The former human face seemed to melt off a form made of rebar and wood fragments, the jaw falling and hitting the center console with a meaty thud. “It’s dannnngerroussss…”

Sam let out a scream as the ground opened up beneath the taxi cab, but the car didn’t fall in. The hole wasn’t nearly big enough; instead, the car started to fold, right at the halfway point. One end moved up to meet the other, Sam crying out as he tried to break the shatterproof window with his bare hands. Even if he’d had something that could do the job he didn’t have the time before the taxi crunched up like someone closing a book, nothing but twisted metal and a broken frame exposing that the taxi hadn’t even had an engine. Sam’s screams of terror turned to those of pain as the steel pierced him, moments before the taxi had made itself thin enough to fall into the space beneath it.

A sickening, cloying smell hit my nostrils again, and I realized it was emanating not just from the hole that had been made but from the nearby manhole cover. I broke out of my fixation on the source of the stench when Annie shook me before pointing toward the electronic billboard, which had replaced its ads with a very different message. Simple white text on a black background.

GO INTO THE TAXIS. IT’LL BE FASTER.

STRUGGLING WON’T SAVE YOU FROM ME.

I’M STILL HUNGRY.

Shortly after that we all heard a new sound over the hissing and sizzling of the acid flowing under our feet. The rolling of more taxi cabs, slowing to a crawl before some unseen force launched them ahead again like a child pushing a toy car along a floor. Coming this way.

Once again we threw ourselves down the street, but after everything else it was getting to be too much. I started seeing cameras in every window, and it seemed like each street we passed had another taxi cab or some sort of van or even a bus rolling down it, those dressed-up puppets staring ahead at nothing just to complete the illusion. We all gasped for air as they all closed in. I gulped.

“In there!” I said, pointing at a dollar store we were one building down from.

“We can’t go in there!” said Travis. “It’ll get us!”

“No choice!” I said. “It’ll definitely get us if we stay out here!”

The bus rounded the corner of the street, heading right our way. We hurled ourselves at the doors of the dollar store, opening them just enough to slip in and vanish inside.

Once inside we moved over to the check-out counters and promptly collapsed onto the ground, wheezing for air and aching all over. I focused on my breath, in and out, the stitch in my side starting to fade as I tried to lie down in a way that let me breathe more easily. It took a bit, but I managed to regain some semblance of energy.

Several minutes in the dollar store and still alive. Good sign so far. Travis sat nearby, and he shared a glance with me. Still alive, but for how long?
