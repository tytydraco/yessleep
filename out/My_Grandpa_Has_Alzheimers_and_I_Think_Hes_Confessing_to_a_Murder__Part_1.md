Grandpa Bill’s brain was ravaged by Alheizmer’s. A man who was a Toastmasters legend, coveted as the eulogy closer at funerals, and had officiated countless weddings could now barely form a coherent sentence. 

He was in his 80s and trying to live his life just as he always had with his mind slipping away. My Grandma had passed just before the effects really started taking him down. He lived in his cold dream house, wandering around, forgetting where he was constantly, and trying to call my dead Grandma. 

I had spent most of my adult life in just as rough shape as my Grandpa was in his 80s, but mine was all self-inflicted. Starting at the age of 15, I hardly ever found a substance I didn’t want to ingest, to the max. 

With that piece of knowledge, it shouldn't be surprising my career opportunities were slim. So I was available when my mom and aunt asked if I could take the job of being my Grandpa’s caretaker. He lived in a five-bedroom house on the beach, I’d change his diapers if he needed. No problem. 

They threw a curveball at me. They had heard bringing someone back to a place they remember well where they spent a short period of their life can help with their memories in connection to Alheizmer’s. 

So I moved to Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California with my Grandpa to live in a little two-bedroom cottage at the edge of the one little town there of 3,000 people. He lived on the island for two years as a teenager and always talked glowingly of the idyllic time he spent there, so that’s where the family wanted him to go to see if by some miracle it could right the ship in his brain. 

I wondered if the setup was for both of us. The island was very hard to get to and I’m sure was a difficult place to get drugs. 

It was. Not that I was looking, but the place was a tiny island and most of the people only lived there in the summer and on the weekend. 

Grandpa and I reached land just after the new year at the coldest and quietest time on the island. It was lonely and eerie walking around the nearly-deserted place with an old man who couldn’t tell I was there 75 percent of the time. 

Grandpa was at his worst at night. I tried to help him at first - explain to him who he was, who I was, where he was, and what was happening, and then either sit him in a chair in front of the T.V. or put him back to bed. 

Eventually at night I locked my bedroom door and let him wander around our little home. I could hear him talking to himself and bumping around out in the living room until he went back to sleep, eventually. 

I couldn’t ignore it one night when I woke to the sounds of him screaming out in hysterical pain. I burst out of bed and into the living room to find my Grandpa standing there, nearly naked, bleeding profusely out of his arm. 

“She stabbed me first!” he screamed at me with crazy eyes. 

“What? Who?” I looked around in the haze of having just woken up in the middle of the night, my foggy brain forgetting about his condition and thinking there may have been a crazed woman actually in the house. 

I thought I heard something clatter in the kitchen. My eyes shifted there and I thought I saw a shadow for a second. 

The time it took me to look in the kitchen allowed Grandpa to step up to me and stick his face right into mine. He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt with a strength I never could have imagined he would still have. 

He just held me there, staring into my eyes as I thought about where the blade that cut him up had to have been. 

He dropped me just after the thought ran through my head and I fell on the floor and then looked up to see a kitchen knife in one of his hands. 

He looked down at me with eyes which couldn’t have been more confused or scared. 

“What is happening?” Grandpa asked me. “What happened to Dolly?” 

\-

I had plenty of time to reflect on it all as I waited for Grandpa at the hospital. I knew that Dolly was his sister growing up, who had died sometime when he was a teenager, but that was all I knew. 

Thinking on the timeline, Grandpa’s time in Catalina had to be either right around or when Dolly died. 

I failed to stay sober. I was going into the few bars in town within a few days. Drinking was never my problem anyway, so I figured why not? 

I settled into The Marlin Inn. A dive bar for fishermen at the far end of town. I nursed beers with the locals and made conversation. Everyone wanted to talk to the new guy in town. 

I bonded most with Lisa. A local. A widow in her 50s who relocated to the island and worked as a server at one of the resorts. 

Her face was always beat red. I wasn’t sure at first if it was from alcoholism or being in the sun too much. 

I soon learned it was from both. 

She was great though and we quickly became the best of friends - drinking late into the night almost every night. I was just babysitting a geriatric. I could be drunk, and as far as I could tell, there were no drugs on the island. 

We started drinking together every night. Not long after I started to spend some time at her apartment above one of the restaurants downtown. We had fun. 

I stumbled home from Lisa’s place well after midnight one night to find the front door of the house I shared with my Grandpa wide open and him not inside.

I paced the entire little town for hours looking for Grandpa and got no sign of him. I’d check our house each time I made it past there. 

After about 10 laps, I walked by our house and Grandpa was sitting on the front steps - a skeleton in his grasp. 

You may have had to read that a few times. Yes, Grandpa was sitting there with a human skeleton laying across his body, crying, and begging for someone to forgive him. 

I got Grandpa, and the skeleton, inside. 

*What the fuck?* I asked myself and Grandpa that over and over and over again. 

I eventually took the skeleton and put the crumbling bones in the closet in Grandpa’s room. They looked old and rusted and dirty. They had been in the ground for quite some time. 

I tried to ask Grandpa about it. He just kept saying the same over and over again until he fell asleep on the couch:

“I’m sorry Dolly.”
