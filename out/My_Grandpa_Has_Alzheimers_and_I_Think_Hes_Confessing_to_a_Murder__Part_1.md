Grandpa Bill’s brain was ravaged by Alheizmer’s. A man who was a Toastmasters legend, coveted as the eulogy closer at funerals, and had officiated countless weddings could now barely form a coherent sentence. 

He was in his 80s and trying to live his life just as he always had with his mind slipping away. My Grandma had passed just before the effects really started taking him down. He lived in his cold dream house, wandering around, forgetting where he was constantly, and trying to call my dead Grandma. 

I had spent most of my adult life in just as rough shape as my Grandpa was in his 80s, but mine was all self-inflicted. Starting at the age of 15, I hardly ever found a substance I didn’t want to ingest, to the max. 

With that piece of knowledge, it shouldn't be surprising my career opportunities were slim. So I was available when my mom and aunt asked if I could take the job of being my Grandpa’s caretaker. He lived in a five-bedroom house on the beach, I’d change his diapers if he needed. No problem. 

They threw a curveball at me. They had heard bringing someone back to a place they remember well where they spent a short period of their life can help with their memories in connection to Alheizmer’s. 

So I moved to Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California with my Grandpa to live in a little two-bedroom cottage at the edge of the one little town there of 3,000 people. He lived on the island for two years as a teenager and always talked glowingly of the idyllic time he spent there, so that’s where the family wanted him to go to see if by some miracle it could right the ship in his brain. 

I wondered if the setup was for both of us. The island was very hard to get to and I’m sure was a difficult place to get drugs. 

It was. Not that I was looking, but the place was a tiny island and most of the people only lived there in the summer and on the weekend. 

Grandpa and I reached land just after the new year at the coldest and quietest time on the island. It was lonely and eerie walking around the nearly-deserted place with an old man who couldn’t tell I was there 75 percent of the time. 

Grandpa was at his worst at night. I tried to help him at first - explain to him who he was, who I was, where he was, and what was happening, and then either sit him in a chair in front of the T.V. or put him back to bed. 

Eventually at night I locked my bedroom door and let him wander around our little home. I could hear him talking to himself and bumping around out in the living room until he went back to sleep, eventually. 

I couldn’t ignore it one night when I woke to the sounds of him screaming out in hysterical pain. I burst out of bed and into the living room to find my Grandpa standing there, nearly naked, bleeding profusely out of his arm. 

“She stabbed me first!” he screamed at me with crazy eyes. 

“What? Who?” I looked around in the haze of having just woken up in the middle of the night, my foggy brain forgetting about his condition and thinking there may have been a crazed woman actually in the house. 

I thought I heard something clatter in the kitchen. My eyes shifted there and I thought I saw a shadow for a second. 

The time it took me to look in the kitchen allowed Grandpa to step up to me and stick his face right into mine. He grabbed me by the collar of my shirt with a strength I never could have imagined he would still have. 

He just held me there, staring into my eyes as I thought about where the blade that cut him up had to have been. 

He dropped me just after the thought ran through my head and I fell on the floor and then looked up to see a kitchen knife in one of his hands. 

He looked down at me with eyes which couldn’t have been more confused or scared. 

“What is happening?” Grandpa asked me. “What happened to Dolly?” 

\-

I had plenty of time to reflect on it all as I waited for Grandpa at the hospital. I knew that Dolly was his sister growing up, who had died sometime when he was a teenager, but that was all I knew. 

Thinking on the timeline, Grandpa’s time in Catalina had to be either right around or when Dolly died. 

I failed to stay sober. I was going into the few bars in town within a few days. Drinking was never my problem anyway, so I figured why not? 

I settled into The Marlin Inn. A dive bar for fishermen at the far end of town. I nursed beers with the locals and made conversation. Everyone wanted to talk to the new guy in town. 

I bonded most with Lisa. A local. A widow in her 50s who relocated to the island and worked as a server at one of the resorts. 

Her face was always beat red. I wasn’t sure at first if it was from alcoholism or being in the sun too much. 

I soon learned it was from both. 

She was great though and we quickly became the best of friends - drinking late into the night almost every night. I was just babysitting a geriatric. I could be drunk, and as far as I could tell, there were no drugs on the island. 

We started drinking together every night. Not long after I started to spend some time at her apartment above one of the restaurants downtown. We had fun. 

I stumbled home from Lisa’s place well after midnight one night to find the front door of the house I shared with my Grandpa wide open and him not inside.

I paced the entire little town for hours looking for Grandpa and got no sign of him. I’d check our house each time I made it past there. 

After about 10 laps, I walked by our house and Grandpa was sitting on the front steps - a skeleton in his grasp. 

You may have had to read that a few times. Yes, Grandpa was sitting there with a human skeleton laying across his body, crying, and begging for someone to forgive him. 

I got Grandpa, and the skeleton, inside. 

*What the fuck?* I asked myself and Grandpa that over and over and over again. 

I eventually took the skeleton and put the crumbling bones in the closet in Grandpa’s room. They looked old and rusted and dirty. They had been in the ground for quite some time. 

I tried to ask Grandpa about it. He just kept saying the same over and over again until he fell asleep on the couch:

“I’m sorry Dolly.”

My nerves kept me awake all night. I tried to gameplan some kind of solution. I came up with nothing other than giving it more time. Those bones had been in the ground for like 60 years. They could spend a few more days in a closet without getting up and walking around, I was sure. 

I was already spinning out of control before the skeleton. I was trying to stay sober babysitting a potential elderly murderer who also happened to be my Grandpa on a sleepy island. 

It was too much to handle - I went to The Marlin Club as soon as they opened. I tore through drinks at a speed I hadn’t used since when I was a younger man. I was damn near blind drunk by mid-afternoon. 

That’s when Lisa came in and I laid into her - spilling everything I hadn’t been telling her about why I was on the island and my Grandpa and Dolly and my struggle with sobriety. She listened to a bit of my explanation about the whole Grandpa and his dead sister thing before she stopped me:

“Wait, that’s YOUR FAMILY?” 

“What family?”

“The murdered sister family. It’s a thing here. Haven’t you taken the ghost tour?”

“No. *What?*”

“I’ve drank on this island to talk to all the locals and hear all the bullshit. There’s some thing back in the 60s there was a rich family that lived here and the daughter stopped coming to school one day and then the brother stopped and no one could figure out what happened. Apparently the family left in the middle of the night and everyone was sure the brother killed the sister,” Lisa explained, stopping three times to sip her cocktail. 

This started to sound right. I had always been told that Grandpa’s sister died when they were younger, but come to think of it, I was never told how.

“Supposedly the family moved far away and changed their names and everything. There was always some rumor that the son missed his girlfriend. This woman Matilda who lives here, and he would cryptically reach out to her throughout her life and he was some rich inventor or something in Florida. He would try to get her to come out to him but only under mysterious circumstances. She tells everyone this. She has a big mouth,” Lisa went on. 

This was not sounding good at all. Grandpa Bill had created something that goes into caffeine or something which made him incredibly rich and he always referred to himself as an “inventor.” He also lived in Florida.  

“Matilda would have to tell you it but something happened where someone tore down the house the family lived in and they found bones underneath the house. They buried them in the cemetery at a grave with her name…*Dolly*, I think.”

The name froze me sitting there in the warm bar, my belly full of booze. 

I spit that booze up all over the bar. 

\-

I didn’t realize it, but I probably had full on alcohol poisoning. After throwing up I tried to get off of my stool and fell on the ground. 

Luckily, Lisa was able to help me home where I promptly passed out. I think. 

\-

I woke up in the living room. I was tied to a chair. The room was completely dark, but I could feel my exact situation. 

I knew I had fucked up even before I heard his voice crackle from across the room. 

“What did you do to Dolly?” Grandpa asked.

“What did I do?” I fired back. “Grandpa, she died more than 20 years before I was born.”

He didn’t ask anything back. I didn’t like that. I heard and felt him move around the room. 

I could sense some dark and evil brewing in that darkness. I suddenly felt pain all over my body. Like I had been pummeled - *maybe I had been*. 

I felt light headed and like my internal clock was running out. My restraints were tight. I felt the world start to rush away from me again. I started to want to give up. 

Then I felt the familiar smell of my Grandpa right in my face. I felt his breath right on mine - that sour smell of old tobacco wafting out of his mouth. 

“If you’re not going to talk, there’s not much else I can do,” Grandpa whispered to me. 

I didn’t know exactly what that meant. I wanted to protest yet I also felt too tired. I started to let it all go again. 

“Hello,” Lisa’s voice drifted into the room from somewhere else. “*Jame*?”

“I don’t know how to explain this but please just come help me out of here. My Grandpa is in here somewhere, and he’s crazy,” I spoke to Lisa with as much urgency as I could inject it with. 

I expected Lisa to answer back with something confused and snarky. She didn’t, and her silence was unnerving. 

I heard someone moving about the room. *Was it Grandpa? Was it Lisa?*  


I didn’t want to say anything more out loud. I didn’t want Grandpa to track either of us. 

I could hear two people moving about the room. Where exactly they were, I had no idea. 

I heard them clash. I heard a struggle. I heard Lisa squeal out in pain. I felt I had to do something. I tried to get up. 

Something pushed me backward and I fell hard onto the ground. 

I knew where I was. I was by the fireplace. I knew there was a poker which rested next to it. I knew it had a decent point on it. 

I felt my hands get to the poker. I felt myself have leverage to where I could work my lashings against it. 

I heard a struggle not far away. The sound of pain which came out of Lisa inspired me to scrape at my lashings as hard and as fast as I could. 

I got enough of it off to free one arm and use that free arm to free the other. I started to get myself off of the chair. 

I felt weathered hands grab my bare arms. I screamed and tried to get away from my Grandpa. 

Then I felt familiar lips on my ear and heard a familiar voice. 

“It’s me. Let’s go,” Lisa whispered into my ear.

\-

Grandpa was alive. He didn’t know where he was. He didn’t know what was happening. He didn’t know who I was. He didn’t know who Lisa was or that she had wrestled him to the ground and broken his collarbone to save me. 

*Did he remember if he killed Dolly or not?* He couldn’t even form a coherent sentence. 

There was one question I wasn’t able to answer and probably only Grandpa could somewhere deep in his brain. 

I went to the closet where I put the bones Grandpa brought home that one night. *They weren’t there.* Some dust remained where I had placed them. 

I went to the cemetery and found the grave - *Dolly Morgan*. It looked disturbed, but I left it at that. 

I walked back into town. I found Lisa. We drank late into the night. 

I went back to the mainland the next day.

I never came back.
