It happened in 2008. I was at home playing King Kong on my PlayStation 2 when my Razor phone buzzed.

It was a picture message sent by a friend and come to find it was a picture of a woman with a scary face. 

I don’t want to read it word for word and risk you having the experience I had. But it’s saying the girls name and how she was killed in a traumatic way, she always wanted to be famous. Send this message to ten different people. If you don’t, she will kill your mom the following night. 

It was like every other lame chain message I had before. I told myself it was nothing and sat my phone down. 

I laid down that evening and fell asleep while watching the television. In the midst of my sleep, I heard my dad screaming. 

I sprinted into there room and seen where my moms bloody body laid. Her throat was cut open.

My dad was on the phone to 911 and screamed for me to get out of the room. I sprinted to my phone and tried to send the chain message. A growling and loud voice loudly pierced my ears. 

“ITS TOO LATE NOW.”

I watched as paramedics rolled away my angelic mother with a sheet over her body. The officers found a knife on the ground and they had reason to believe it was my father. He was just as upset as I was.

As the officer tried getting him in the back of the car, he hollered for me and told me that he didn’t do it. I of course told him I believed him. A man from social services came and took me away.

Evidence came back with dads fingerprints on the knife and he was sentenced to prison where he died by the hands of another prisoner that didn’t like why he was in. 

My life became shitty. I was bounced from foster house to foster house. No one believed me when I tried to tell them that it was that lady. I mean who would? I hit a dark depression and no one would listen, even my therapist didn’t believe me. 

I moved away as quick as I could and took shitty jobs. Eventually I landed a job as a custodian at a mental health institute and stuck with it. I made friends with some other custodians and even a few nurses. 

The reason I’m typing this out is because something happened today that has shook me to my core and put so much fear in me. 

I was taking a smoke break at work when my phone pinged. It was a text message sent to me by my ex girlfriend. 

“Hey Ted, hope you’re doing well. I’m sending you a message and I know it’s silly  but I’m superstitious.” The next following message made the cigarette fall out of my mouth. 

It was the exact same chain message that I received when I was a kid. The only difference was it said that it would kill me instead of my mother. 

I sent my ex girlfriend a message back and asked her if it said it would get her if she didn’t forward it. She told me that the message said it mentioned her mother. 

Brandy never knew what really happened to my parents. We didn’t date that long. I told her I never knew my parents and was always a kid being fostered. 

I walked back into work and a patient walked by me. “She’s never forgotten about you.” 

I turned my attention back to the patient and she was gone. 

Im not going to send this chain mail to ten people. Im going to find a way stop her. Im going to update you all as soon as I can. Im really, really scared though.
