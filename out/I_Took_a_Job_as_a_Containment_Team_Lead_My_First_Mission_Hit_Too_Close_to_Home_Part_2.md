"We got them all. We got Pigg. We got the console, collars, and bootleg RDC," I said into the headset. We also took hard drives full of *material* that, while not anomalous, made my stomach turn more than feeling my own bones weave themselves back together.

"Excellent! We're sending trucks in now to bring the subjects into custody. Keep *Pigg* with you, though; probably best not to let him out of sight for too long."

When the last cage hit the street, the witness left his window and sprinted into the yard.

He made it three steps towards us before I stopped him.

“That’s your sister, isn't it? Lydia? She's still in there, somewhere." I said, trying my best to console him. "We might be able to bring her back, since she hasn't been like this for very long."

I could see that he doubted my words, so I told him a gentle lie. "This isn't the first time we've dealt with this."

I decided to do my best to make him feel like he had done *something* to save his sister, a truth this time.

"You're the one who tipped off our informant at the PD, by the way. This wouldn't have been possible without you. Sorry about the way he acted towards you, but *we can't have things like this on the public record."*

I felt like an idiot for saying that last part, and started to walk away. That's when I noticed the way she was staring at him. Lydia, a devious grin spread across her face, was staring at Grett and bending the bars on her cage outward in an attempt to get to him.

I spun around on my heel, remembering the card. "If you see her again, and she *isn't* being escorted to your front door by us, *do not let her in*." I tried to hide the fear in my voice as I relayed this information to him, but I think my facial expressions betrayed me.

I handed him the card and explained, "Keep this card on you at all times. If she *does* come back for you, she won't be able to touch you as long as you have it.

I walked away, and he meandered back into his own house.

"Aren't you gonna... y'know, *Men In Black* that guy?" Thatcher asked, holding up his wand and imitating clicking a button on the hilt.

"I don't think it'll be necessary, plus he's more useful to us with his memory intact. I gave him a card... I think his sister might try to seek him out if we don't keep her locked up. The way she was looking at him..." I said.

"We all noticed it too," Miller said, before I could finish the thought. "I think you made the right decision."

We loaded the last container, then, as we were shown in training, four of us stood about 10 meters out at each corner of the house and set our wands to full power before activating the *Burst* function.

"The implosions are noiseless and lightless at full power," Holmgren began, "because the density of KF energy at that level surpasses its Schwarzschild radius for less than a tenth of a millisecond. Any matter caught inside is effectively turned into pure KF energy, which the shield function automatically protects us against. It's an in-built safety feature."

After nothing was left of the house, we went around with our wands on the lowest setting of burst, pointed at the ground. Where we pointed, fresh grass sprouted and grew. This was also something that Holmgren taught us on the fly. This explains why he didn't ask very many questions during training. I suppose he already *knew*.

By first light, it looked as if the house had never been there. The rest was up to the *Cleaners,* forging paperwork and swaying bureaucracy to make the masses believe none of this ever happened.

\---

We never got the luxury of a debrief. Lydia went into an isolation bay with the rest of the recovered subjects. Someone upstairs decided to begin “correction” on Tuesday, but come this afternoon, she wasn’t in her bay anymore.

“Containment breach,” Holmgren said over comms. “Tracker's inactive, subject is the sister of the witness.”

“The *witness*,” Miller repeated.

“Grett,” I said. “Move.”

We killed the van in the same spot. No police this time, and no sign of Grett. Or, more worryingly, Lydia.

Holmgren dropped the Field Sphere on the grass and flipped it to sensor-only mode. We kept all shields down in hopes that she would be drawn to us *instead* of Grett.

"KF signature, about a kilometer away and closing in. *Fast.*" Holmgren said, pointing due north.

"How fast?" I asked, but the question soon didn't matter. Silently, and before any of us could react, Lydia had appeared and climbed the side of Grett's house, stopping at the second-floor window.

“Up,” I said, motioning for the rest of the team, who hadn't even noticed her there yet. All of us except Holmgren made our way through the front door and were going up the stairs when an ear-piercing screech, mixed with the sound of shattering glass, erupted from the bedroom.

The bedroom was a snow globe of broken glass and dust that had been thrown up in the blast. Grett lay in the corner, knocked unconscious but with no visible sign of *fresh* injury. The black card clenched in his hand so tight that his knuckles had gone white. He was breathing.

"*Smart man.*" I thought to myself.

The light had blown. In the window... what was left of the window... Lydia’s face hovered just beyond the frame, smile wide, eyes painted a malicious shade of patience.

“Lydia,” Dwyer said, “It’s okay. We’re here.”

Her head tilted when she heard Dwyer’s words, like she had just heard a joke she didn't understand.

Thatcher eased to the far side, activating his shield and attempting to block any direct path to Grett. I moved forward, readying my wand.

I clicked Null on a low setting and felt the bubble of silence form around me as well. Lydia’s hand twitched. She reached for the line where the shield ended and recoiled like it burned.

“Edward,” Holmgren said through my earpiece, “we can pin her with the Sphere if you bring her three steps inside the room; any less than that and we risk *frying* her."

“Lydia,” I said, and for a second she looked at me. “We’re going to bring you home. But you have to step inside.”

Her eyes flicked to me, then the wand in my hand, then to the card in Grett's. The grin widened and trembled.

“*Step,*” she said, or rather the thing inside her said, deep and guttural. The glass on the floor chimed like a chorus of bells in tune with her word.

She moved. Fast, but we were faster. Holmgren slammed the Sphere to full power as soon as he saw her move. Lydia winced, screamed, and then she was on the floor, hands raking at the floorboards. Her painted nails, long since flaked and cracked, ripped away as the trapped animal within tried to escape the small space between the three bubbles of *Null*.

“Now,” I said.

Miller dove, pinning her wrists with the polished restraints; Dwyer slid down to her feet and restrained her ankles.

Lydia screamed; inhuman, maddening. Dwyer and Miller both fell unconscious to the floor, but it was too little, too late. She was restrained and no longer a threat.

The scream thinned, softened, turned into a breath. Lydia blinked once, twice. The grin had vanished from her face; in its place, she wore a scowl of pure malice.

Holmgren came upstairs at that moment. "Help Dwyer and Miller, they weren't in the shields when she screamed. I think it may have affected them."

I directed, and Holmgren obeyed. In no time, the two were back on their feet, only a faint line of blood running from their ears as evidence they had ever been unconscious.

Thatcher and I lifted Lydia and carried her like a prisoner down the stairs, out into the quiet street. Holmgren shut down the Sphere; the local KF reading came back at 0.013Hz, like it should be. The restraints on Lydia prevented the entity from altering any of the Kyrie Field beyond her body, and even prevented it from *leaving* said body while they were attached. We loaded Lydia into the cage in the back of the van, locking it and closing the doors.

We left Grett in his bed, unconscious. Dwyer checked his vitals before we left the room and assured me he would be okay. I'm not sure how much he will remember. Hopefully he wasn't awake to see us dragging his sister away from him for the *second* time.

At the curb, Dwyer squeezed my arm. “You did good, boss. That was a tough situation, and *you* led us through.”

Miller glanced up at the sky, and I followed his gaze. The clouds on the horizon were glowing the dark purple of a Georgia sunset, with beams gleaming out of gaps in the cloud layers.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" I said aloud.

"It's almost as if Heaven could be just beyond those clouds." He said, reaching his hand out and squeezing the clouds between his fingers.

"If there is a Heaven, I'm sure that Dr. Kruger nutjob would find *some way* to blow it up for evoking *too* much curiosity." Thatcher joked, joining us in our cloud watching.

"If there is a Heaven, I'm sure Elliot has every Angel and the Big Man himself cataloged already," Dwyer added to the joke.

"I can still hear you, you know..." Elliot cracked over our comms. We all chucked slightly.

"But there *is* a Heaven. It's in Sweden, and my brother works there. He's an engineer too." Holmgren said, serious as a heart attack.

We all turned to look at him, hoping this was some kind of dry humor.

\---

Night has fallen now. The crisp Autumn air blows over my face as I gaze out into the countryside through the rolled-down window of the van. Thatcher volunteered to drive back, since I still have a little trouble feeling the whole right side of my torso after what happened during the Pigg incident. Holmgren assures me this is temporary, and I should be back to normal by next week. I trust him.

A faint hum is growing in the air now, and the trees and fields have taken on a hue of familiarity as the headlights pass over them.

***We must be pretty close to Calloway.***
