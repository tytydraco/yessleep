Before you contact the police, you need to know that my job isn’t normal. I never applied for it. I can’t tell anyone about it. And if I try to quit, my bosses will kill me. So I’ve decided to beat them at their own game. While reading this story, you might find my bosses likable. Funny. Charming, as those old bastards would say. But don't let them fool you. Believe me, the world will be much better off without them. 

I guess I should begin with how I became the unfortunate hero of this story. It all started, as so many terrible things do, with a Tinder date.

I’ve never been a good-looking guy. I’m well aware that self-deprecation is somewhat expected for this website, but it’s true. The only person who ever called me handsome is my Nana. My single attractive trait is that I’m taller than average. But that’s balanced out my physique, which could best be described as “a scarecrow on Ozempic.” Worst of all, my vision is so bad that I need Coke-bottle glasses in order to see more than a foot away.

After I moved to Pittsburgh for college, I went my entire freshman year without attempting to date anyone. Some of my friends, concerned for my wellbeing, convinced me to sign up for Tinder. I was unsure of it, at first. I thought Tinder was a site for hookups, and I’m more of a romantic. But since my friends insisted that this was the path to love, I relented. The first few dates I went on were fine- not great, but not disastrous enough to post to Reddit. I was about to give up when I matched with Daisy.

I was shocked that she swiped right on me at all. Daisy was very pretty- in other words, way out of my league. Second of all, when she messaged me, she was super chatty and enthusiastic. She was eighteen, grew up in London, and loved reading and going to museums and concerts. She was super excited to meet me and made this clear with multiple exclamation points and emojis. Though I was almost certain she was a catfish, I couldn’t pass up a chance to go on a date.

We ate dinner at a restaurant near campus. I was shocked to find out that Daisy was even more beautiful in person. She had a heart-shaped face with huge, ice-blue eyes. She was short, but had the sort of hourglass figure rarely seen outside of Hollywood. She had put her curly, light blonde hair in a high ponytail and wore a baby blue sundress. The only unattractive thing about her was that she was really pale- her skin was literally the color of milk. It was like she’d never gone outside in her life.

When she first saw me I braced for her disappointed reaction, but there was none. Her face broke out into a massive smile, like I was the most handsome guy she’d even seen. She spoke with a British accent that made her sound posh, like a character from *Pride and Prejudice.* Throughout dinner, she talked constantly, asking about where I’m from, what I was studying, my hobbies. She seemed genuinely interested in me, more so than any other girl I’d ever talked to. I was so excited that I failed to notice she was learning way more about me than I was about her.

After she generously offered to pay for both our meals (good thing, too, because she ate twice as much as I did), she offered to take me back to her place. I guess I shouldn’t have been surprised- I did meet her on Tinder, after all- but in my experience, girls like Daisy were rarely so forward. Still, I jumped at the opportunity. At that point, I was putty in her hands.

Our Uber took us to a part of the city known as Squirrel Hill. It’s a well-kept neighborhood with nice houses and manicured lawns. Some of those houses are huge- more like mansions. I always assumed they were bed and breakfasts or luxury apartments. So you could imagine my surprise when the Uber pulled up to one of the biggest houses there. It was made entirely of white stone, with massive columns and a fountain in the front driveway. Half the facade was covered in ivy, but the rest of the property was immaculate.

Daisy got out and stood on the driveway, staring at the night sky. The usual Pittsburgh clouds had dispersed, and a full moon glared down at her like a gigantic spotlight. “What a beautiful moon,” she said, maybe just to herself.

I was still gawking at the house. “You’re… renting a room here?”

Daisy began moving up the drive. “No,” she said, still smiling, “This is my entire house.”

Jesus. Pretty, nice, and filthy rich? There had to be a catch. But Daisy had already disappeared through the front door, and I found myself following behind like a lovesick puppy.

The inside of the house was just as fancy as the outside. Victorian-style furniture, shining hardwood floors, Renaissance paintings. We passed by a room with the door slightly ajar, and I glimpsed a library with bookshelves up to the ceiling.

She led me not into her bedroom, but her “parlor.” I guess that’s rich-British-people-talk for “fancy living room.” It was just as exquisitely decorated as the rest of the house. I sank down on the tiny sofa, awkwardly trying to arrange my long legs, not really sure of what to do. Fortunately, or as I would soon learn, unfortunately, Daisy made the first move.

Daisy grabbed my hand. Her hand was freezing, and between that and how pale it was, I was hit with the sensation that I was holding hands with a corpse. But that was ridiculous. Maybe she just had poor circulation. 

She had never stopped smiling. Her teeth were tiny, perfectly straight and white. “I’m so glad you’re here, Elliot.”

“So am I,” I replied stupidly.

She moved closer to me, so that her shoulder was right against mine. Even through her dress and my button-down shirt, her skin was ice cold. “You’re a pretty good-looking fellow,” she was saying. 

“You’re joking,” I chuckled. 

“I’m not.” She used a slender finger to tilt my head her way. “I don’t have much experience with American boys. I didn’t realize they could be so-” she stopped, her blue eyes going vacant for a split second- “warm.”

“You’re so cold,” I mumbled.

I think she was saying, “Help me change that,” but at that point, her lips were already against mine.

In short, we started making out. I’ll spare you the details, except the most essential: we started on the tiny sofa, and wound up with my back against the wall opposite the door. At some point, I lost my glasses. I was so… um, *preoccupied…* that when I felt Daisy pulling down my collar and sinking her teeth into my neck, I thought she was just getting kinky.

But Daisy’s nibbles turned into bites, and her bites started to hurt. Not in a sexy way- it felt more like she had taken a scalpel to the skin below my jaw. *Shit. Did we agree on a safe word?* I tried to tell her to stop, but something red shot across my vision. Daisy shrieked as it splattered across her face. Blood. My blood. I held a hand to my neck and felt the blood shooting out like from a fountain, in time with each of my heartbeats. Some of the spurts made it halfway across the room.

With each spurt of blood I felt weaker. My already blurry vision was becoming downright foggy. I tried to speak, but the sound that came out was a mix between a groan and a gurgle. I tried to move, but wound up falling backwards against the wall and slumping to the floor. Daisy was speaking quickly, in the breathy, high-pitched voice that I found so cute just a few minutes ago. She looked panicked, but wasn’t making an effort to stop the bleeding or call 911. Her big blue eyes had gone enormous with fear. Like the song… *Her hair is Harlow gold… Her lips sweet surprise… Her hands are never cold..* Not this girl! I tried to laugh, but only heard myself make gurgling sounds.

A man appeared in the room. And I do mean appeared: the door never opened, he just materialized from under the door frame, surrounded by mist. His entire figure was blurry, but he seemed tall and athletic-looking. “Daisy!” he bellowed, in a similar accent, “What have you done?”

Daisy flew over to where the man was standing. I mean, literally *flew*: I saw her feet leave the floor in front of me. She glided towards him and continued floating in the air, so she could be at his eye level. 

“I’m so sorry, Lord Cyrus,” she was saying, “Everything was going so well! It was just supposed to be a regular feeding. I don’t know what happened!” She sounded genuinely upset.

“You’ve missed the jugular and bitten his carotid artery. 200 years of this, and you still can’t tell the difference. Now you’ve gotten blood all over the furniture. And your dress is ruined- I bought that for you a fortnight ago!”

*Fortnight?* Was this guy a *Bridgerton* character?

At this point I was lying on the floor, in a puddle of my own blood. The blood was still shooting out, but weaker. I took in the sights around me. There was a massive potted ficus on my left. An elaborately carved coffee table to my right. The wallpaper was cream in color, with a small but exquisite floral pattern. Even the ceiling was carved with a design, although at that point I could barely see it. I was about to experience one of the most embarrassing deaths imaginable, but at least I’d die someplace nice. It was a beautiful room to die in.

Daisy began to whimper. The man sighed. “I suppose it’s alright. Anyone can make mistakes. We’ll just throw him in the incinerator and start cleaning up.”

Although I was dying, the mention of an incinerator sent a wave of panic through me. I tried to scream but only gurgled and retched up some more blood. 

Daisy and the man stopped talking and turned to look at me. “My God…” the man said, “He’s still *alive?*”

He walked over and bent down to look at me, Daisy following close behind. I couldn’t make out his face, but his tone was even, analytical. “He *is* alive. Barely. I should snap the poor bastard’s neck and put him out of his misery.” I tried to protest, but only managed a moan and a wiggle.

“No!” shrieked Daisy. “This is a sign! He’s not like other mortals. He’s special. Can we keep him, Lord Cyrus? Please, please, please?” She was bobbing up and down in the air.

“And do *what* with him, exactly?”

“He could be my familiar! I haven’t had a familiar in so long! Can I please have him?”

*What the fuck is a familiar?* Before I could hear any more, everything went black.

I woke up to fluorescent lights and the sound of a beeping monitor. The metallic taste of blood still hung in my acrid mouth. Looking around, I realized I was in a hospital bed. There was a large bandage on my neck, right where Daisy had bitten me. Someone came up to me and handed me my glasses. Once I put them on, I realized, to my horror, who the person was.

“Good afternoon,” said Lord Cyrus. “Mr. Grant, is it?”

He came around and sat on the edge of my bed. He was tall and broad-shouldered, with thick black hair and the most vivid green eyes I had even seen. He looked to be in his early thirties. His skin was bronze, with a washed-out, almost grayish undertone that made him look somewhat sickly. He wore a suit that probably cost more than my tuition. Like Daisy, he was good-looking, but in a different way. Older, more worldly, more dangerous. While Daisy sparkled, Lord Cyrus smoldered.

Daisy, meanwhile, was hovering near the ceiling, reading a copy of *Sharp Objects*. When she saw I was awake, she dropped the book onto a chair and perched on my footboard like a gargoyle.

“Umm…” I mumbled, still slightly groggy, “Just call me... Elliot is fine.”

“You’re quite the survivor, aren’t you?” said Lord Cyrus, “You really ought to have bled out in the parlor. I wanted to snap your neck and be done with it, but Daisy took a liking to you.”

Daisy’s smile grew eerily wide. I noticed that her canine teeth were long and sharp. They didn’t look like that before. 

Lord Cyrus continued, “I’ve taken the liberty of paying your hospital bill.”

“Gee… thanks.” What could I say when his little friend put me in the hospital to begin with? “How did you explain what happened to my neck?”

He said matter-of-factly, “You and Daisy were being… intimate, when you fell against the wall and pierced your neck with a protruding nail.”

“What?” I exclaimed, “That’s the best you come up with?” In addition to trying to kill me, these two probably turned me into the laughingstock of the Pittsburgh medical system.

He shrugged. “The point is, Elliot, we kept you alive for a specific purpose. Daisy-”

She interjected, “I want you to become my familiar!”

“A familiar,” Lord Cyrus explained, “is a bit like a personal assistant. You will serve as Daisy’s companion, chaperone, and valet.” He must have seen the horrified expression on my face, because he added, “You will be paid, of course. We don’t believe in slave labor.”

Maybe it was the usual hospital chill, but I started trembling. “For how long?”

“As long as Daisy wants.”

“And if I refuse?” I asked, though I already suspected the answer.

“Daisy tears open your stitches and finishes her meal, and we make it look like an accident.”

Daisy, still perched on the footboard, made her blue eyes go huge and wide, pleading with me. Puppy-dog eyes, like my mom would say. Her canine teeth were normal now. I guess she could grow and retract her teeth at will, like a cat’s claws. She looked adorable, like the innocent, happy girl I found the restaurant. Who could guess this was the face of a monster?

My trembling turned to shaking. The wound on my neck throbbed with pain, as if anticipating what Daisy could do. The horrible things these two could do to me… I hated them, for pretending they were giving me a choice, for feigning generosity. This wasn’t a job offer so much as a deal with the devil. Those always ended the same: another soul dragged to the bottom of Hell.

Of course I said yes. What other choice did I have? 

“One more thing,” I added. “*What* are you two?”

“Why, Elliot,” Daisy replied. Her fangs grew back, and when Lord Cyrus smiled, I could see he had a pair of his own. “What do you think?”

Seven years later, and I still cannot put into words how desperately I wanted to scream.
