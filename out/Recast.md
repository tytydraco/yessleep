“Alexa, Intruder detected. Home defenses activate!” Behind the unkempt beard, Jason was smiling; a friendly sort of smile, but his command held no less weight. Inside the freshly painted drywall of his brand new home, gears could be heard turning and hydraulic pistons sprang into action. The lights in the room began pulsating red in alarm as two air conditioning vents opened to reveal small laser turrets hidden within.



“Home defenses active. Intruder identified.” Alexa’s eerily calm voice responded as the blue ring of light spun atop the flat black cylinder of the unit.



“Dude. Come on. Not funny.” Tiny red pointers danced across my chest from the turrets as I stood, frozen in the kitchen. I knew he just wanted to show off the tech, but I’d prefer he show it off on a watermelon. Capacitors powered up with a high-pitched whine inside the air vents, threatening to release their payload at any moment. “Cutting it close, Jason. I don’t want to piss all over your kitchen floor, and Heather probably doesn’t want to clean up blood.”



“Alexa, stop!” Heather slapped Jason on the shoulder as she walked past him, opening the stainless steel door of the fridge and leaning in. “He’s right,” she began, as she rifled through the condiments, “but I won’t be cleaning it up. You’ll get to clean his and your blood if that thing goes off in here. They just finished these floors. Where the hell is the barbecue sauce?” The air vents closed, and the lights faded back to a familiar white. No response issued from Alexa aside from the blue ring of light circling, evidencing her acknowledgement of the command. The fridge door shut, and Heather emerged triumphantly, barbecue sauce in hand. “Someday you’re gonna be playing with that thing and it’s gonna go off on the wrong person. It’s not a toy.”



“That’s what she said!” Came a muffled shout from out on the deck. Travis was on burger duty and keenly focused on the task, but couldn’t pass up such a clear opportunity. “And I told you I wanted to see the look on his face, dammit! Did he piss himself?”



“No, I didn’t piss myself. Did you?” I hadn’t, but give that little light show on my chest another few seconds and I would have. 



“Fuck yeah I did. You kidding me? We gotta get that at the house. You know that, right?”



“Jason, where’s the little boy’s room? Might not have, but I need to.”  I was trying to laugh at the joke, but I’d need a few minutes to see the funny.



“Down the hall. To the left.” Jason was stifling laughter. He’d obviously pulled this on everyone who’d come to the house in the week since it had been finished. I made my way through the people gathered in the living room. An open house party would surely be the best time to accidentally murder someone with your home defense system. Some were snickering, having had the same thing done to them. Some looked as shocked as I still felt.



Beyond the smells of food cooking in the kitchen, the rest of the house smelled of fresh paint and new carpet. With the dog and three cats, they’d have it ‘lived in’ soon enough, but for now it was a strange feeling. It was like riding in someone’s brand new car with your muddy shoes on. Pale off-white light cast a glow beneath the bathroom door. I knocked softly, belying the rising urgency of the visit. “Anyone in there?”



“Just a docent.” Came a strangely garbled young woman’s voice. It sounded like whoever was in there had a bad case of strep throat.



“Docent? I’m sorry, but this is turning into an emergency. You okay in there?” I wanted to be concerned for her, but my own needs were taking precedence, especially after Jason’s little prank.



“Docent. Docen... Doce.... Minute. Just a minute.” The voice coming from the bathroom sounded like a scratched record that finally caught up with itself. I leaned closer, trying to figure out if I should go get help for her.



“Don’t mind her.” I felt a sudden, firm hand on my shoulder.



“Jesus fucking mother of what the hell are you trying to do? Is it ‘make James piss himself’ day?” I whirled around to see Jason, eyes wide and laughing hysterically.



“On edge are we?” He said once he’d calmed down. “I’m sorry, man. I was just going to show you the other bathroom. I forgot Ellie was in there. She’s a re-cast. Needs to go in for an update, by the sounds of it. Poor thing.”



“A re-cast. I don’t think I’ve ever seen one in person. Not too many left these days, are there?” Re-casts were from the iron curtain days - machines built by a tech company well ahead of its time to be sold as human-replacement spies. Once the curtain went down, some were ‘re-cast’ in everyday jobs in a fairly controversial effort to integrate humanity and technology. “How do you know... Ellie was it?”



“Yeah. Heather’s sister knows her. She taught her math in grade school.”



“You invited Heather’s sister’s re-cast math teacher to your housewarming party, but not Heather’s sister?”



Jason simply smiled and winked. “Oops. Come on. Bathroom’s this way.”



“No need. I’m finite.” The bathroom door opened and I got my first personal glimpse of a re-cast. For a forty-year-old machine, she still fit the part. Straight brown hair framed a delicate face with enough strands of grey to look natural for the age she was meant to replicate. Laugh lines had been meticulously added around her eyes and mouth. Someone had gone through immense pains in her design, down to the blackheads in her pores. I imagined that in their day, they would have been indistinguishable from a human. Her skin lacked the lustre of a real person’s and something in her eyes gave away the illusion, but I’m certain that’s because I was looking for it.



“Finished Ellie. You’re finished.” Jason took Ellie by the arm and led her out into the hallway, motioning for me to go in.



I closed the door behind me, suddenly realising my bladder had been as curious as I was. After all of that, I didn’t need to go anymore. I stood in front of the mirror studying my own features. Inching towards forty, I sported more grey than Ellie. I suppose we were both ‘born’ around the same year. She was finally looking her age, while I had grown into mine. ‘No Ellie, I am finite,’ I thought to myself.



I rejoined the party once I was able to succeed in my original lavatorial goals. Several people were backed up against the wall with shocked looks splayed across their faces. On the floor, between the kitchen island and stove, Jason huddled over what looked like the twitching body of Ellie. Beneath him, I could hear the word “finite” being repeated in a broken, mechanical version of Ellie’s voice.



“Fuck, somebody get me the pliers or something. Heather! Where did we put the tools?” As Jason rose to call out to Heather, I could plainly see Ellie’s face. Where her left eye should have been, protruded the mottled silver of half an open tin can. The other half was buried in her skull and her face was slathered with a sticky, caramel-colored substance.



“Dude. I didn’t do shit, okay? I warmed up the beans on the grill like you guys said. I was bringing them back in and this bitch freaked the fuck out and took them from me and...!” Travis was leaning against the kitchen cabinet, wide eyed and holding a bean-covered pair of barbecue tongs aloft with one hand. He looked as if he was ready to either beat Ellie with the tongs should she move towards him again, vomit,  or bolt out the door. Given the scene, I wouldn’t hold any of these against him. 



“It’s fine Travis! Just find me some tools!” Jason was trying to get the situation under control, but everyone yelling over everyone else was getting things nowhere. 



“I’ll check the garage,” I said. Personally, I didn’t mind not being near the scene. 



In the massive garage they’d had built in their new house, I found a metal shelving unit piled with all sorts of boxes and bags that hadn’t been unpacked into the house yet. I searched for what seemed like forever before I uncovered an old toolbox underneath a black duffel bag. I could still hear people screaming in the other room. I opened the toolbox and tore through the contents, trying my best to find anything close to pliers. Why did Jason need this many old hammers? The door to the garage swung open with a loud crash as I neared the bottom of the toolbox.



“I found the toolbox. Not sure you guys have any pliers, though.” As I said that, I spied a pair of rusty vice grips at the bottom. Jackpot! I turned to give the tool to whoever had come to retrieve it.



Ellie stood in the doorway, head hung low. Her greying brown locks, matted with the bean juice, covered her face and her body twitched irregularly. No one was behind her in the open door. The house had gone eerily silent - a stark contrast to the pure bedlam from moments before. Confused, I held the vice grips at arm’s length. “I found...”



In the moment between two words, Ellie charged the distance between us and slammed me against the metal garage door. She dug her dainty-looking mechanical fingers deep into my ribs and stomach and began pushing. Head ringing from the collision, I could feel the aluminum digging into my back as she lifted me without effort off my feet. The door rose slightly too as she raised me off the floor and I felt the metal buckle outward behind me. 



“Ellie... what are..” I tried to find reason in the moment, but she dug in deeper. I felt several ribs crack, and her fingers began penetrating my skin, burying themselves in my organs. In that moment, I remembered Jason’s trick from earlier. I took as deep a breath as I could from the one lung that still functioned and tried to shout through the blood that was now building in my throat and spilling out of my mouth. “Alexa! Intruder detected!” Ellie responded by pushing her hands further forward. I could feel the ribs crack at my back and hear the tinny scrape of metal as she pushed through my body and punched through the garage door. “Activate home... defenses...” I coughed a mouthful of blood with those last words which coated the top of Ellie’s hair. Then I heard what I thought might be my salvation.



“Home defenses active,” rang out the calm, familiar voice of Alexa.  Ellie lifted her head for the first time since entering the garage and met my gaze. The tin can had been removed. In its place, I saw the swirling blue light of the Alexa unit, fused with the left side of Ellie’s face. “Intruder identified.”
