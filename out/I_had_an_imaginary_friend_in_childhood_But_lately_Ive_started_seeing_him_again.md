When I was a little girl, I had an imaginary friend.I called him Mr. Paper Bag.

Four years old, I moved with my parents to a small town in Connecticut, I didn't have any friends there, and my parents couldn’t accompany me because of busy work.

I was lonely,and then I started imagining some non-existent partners, that’s when Mr. Paper Bag appeared.

He was tall and always wore a black suit, I couldn't see his face because he had a linen paper bag on his head.And that’s why I called him Mr.Paper Bag.

There were two holes in the paper bag. I guess Mr. Paper bag was looking at me through the holes, but I couldn't see his eyes through them.

Mr. Paper Bag never talks, but he was willing to play every game with me, even the stupid ones.

He stayed with me for many years. Even after I entered elementary school, I could still see him. When I played games with my friends in school, I could sometimes see him standing alone in the corner, but he never interrupt me.

As I grew older, my life was full of new things, there were more friends around me, so gradually I no longer needed Mr. Paper Bag, and one day he just disappeared.

I know it's common to have an imaginary friend in childhood, especially if you're the only child in the family and your parents are busy at work.

What I want to say,is that several years later, I started seeing Mr. Paper Bag again.

After graduating from college, my parents divorced and started their own families, I was thrown back into loneliness.

Fortunately, I met Will, the man who makes me think that worthy of entrusting my life to. We rented a small apartment and worked hard, hoped to save enough money to get married.

A few days ago, I was walking home alone after finishing my shift at night. As I was walking through an alley, I felt someone was watching me from behind.

I looked back reflexively, but no one was there. However the feeling of being peeped was so obvious that it made my skin crawl.

I became more alert, paying close attention to the sounds around me, but except for my footsteps, everything was dead silent.

Suddenly, a cat screamed from behind me, which scared me half to death. I turned around immediately and found a vague figure in the dim light.

Even though it has been many years, I still recognized it was Mr. Paper Bag, or maybe  just a pervert disguised as that.

I quickened my pace and secretly prayed him would not catch up with me.

Fortunately, nothing happened.

“Do you feel like here’s someone else?”

While eating breakfast,Will asked.

“No,why?”

I asked as I drank my coffee.

“I don't know, I thought I saw someone when I went to the bathroom last night.”

Will was confused.

“Have you checked around? ”

I suddenly remembered the weird man I met.

“Yes, but found nothing.”

Will answered.

“Maybe we are overreacting.”

I smiled and kissed him, then went out to work.

I saw that weird man again, this time in our apartment.

When I got up in the middle of the night to drink water, I saw him in the kitchen.

I screamed immediately, but no sound came out of my throat, as if someone had choked me or taken the sound out of my mouth.

My body was frozen in place. But it's not I don't want to move, I can’t.

The man slowly walked towards me, pointing at a knife on the counter.I tried to see his eyes through the hole in the paper bag, but all I saw was darkness.

I closed my eyes and accept my fate helplessly,that was the only thing I could do.

Suddenly the light was turned on, I opened my eyes again and the weird man had disappeared.

“What are you doing hon?”

Will asked worriedly.

I cried in Will's arms, telling him over and over that I had just seen someone in the kitchen.

“So where did he go?”

Will asked.

I shook my head,because I didn’t see it.

Will checked the apartment but still found nothing, so we called the police, but they didn't find any signs of intrusion.

In the next few days, I always woke up in the middle of the night, fearing that the weird man would appear again.

Tonight I was woken by some rustling noises, and when I opened my eyes, Will was standing next to me.

And,he had a knife.

I was so scared that I sat up immediately.

Will didn't give me a chance to escape, he raised the knife and prepared to stab me.

"I'm sorry, but I have to do this for her."

This was Will's last words.

He hadn’t no intention of stopping what he was doing.

However, his face suddenly twisted, as if he was in great pain.

Then, his arms were folded behind his back in an extremely exaggerated manner by an invisible force. The knife in his hand also fell to the ground.

Only then did I realize that the weird man had appeared again.

Will began to burn, but no flame here. His body was just gradually charred in the air, accompanied by the smell of meat being cooked.

At last, Will disappeared, yes, not even a bone was left, just a pile of ashes on the floor.

“Mr.Paper Bag?”

I asked the man.

He didn't say anything, just took off the paper bag on his head. I finally saw his face,it was burned beyond recognition.

I wasn't scared, I just shed tears.

Mr.Paper Bag was gone.

I looked through Will's phone and found out that he had been in love with another girl for a long time.

Maybe that's why Will wanna break up with me, but I cried and begged him not to leave for every time.

Recently,they planned to kill me to defraud insurance.

I looked up the history of that house in Connecticut, and Google told me that in 1945 a man was disfigured because of the fire caused by his wife and her lover, and he spent the rest of his life alone in that house.
