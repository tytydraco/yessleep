I’m 16, and I don’t know why they keep locking me up. My name’s Ethan, and I’ve been hauled into psych wards more times than I can count—sterile white walls smudged with faint yellow streaks, fluorescent lights buzzing like trapped flies, air heavy with bleach and the sour musk of fear. The doctors won’t say what I did to land here; they just cinch the straps tighter, force pills past my lips, and swap the meds every time I come back—each one harsher, crazier than the last. I’m writing this in a spiral notebook I snatched from the rec room, my hands jittering across the page, because I need someone to hear me. I don’t belong here, but whatever they’re pumping into me is tearing my head apart, and I’m terrified I’ll lose what’s left of myself.

It started when I was little, maybe 8. I woke up in a padded cell—walls soft and greasy, like someone’s sweaty palms, the air thick with a stale, rubbery stink. My wrists and ankles were locked in leather restraints, cracked and stiff, reeking of old spit and panic. A doctor hovered over me, his glasses fogged up, his breath a cloying waft of mint gum, scribbling on a clipboard as he droned about “episodes” and “hallucinatory breaks.” I didn’t get it—my mind was a swamp, sluggish and blurred, but I wasn’t freaking out ‘til they started the meds. They gave me small white pills first—bitter little ovals that crumbled on my tongue, leaving a chalky grit. My fingers shook after, twitching like they’d forgotten how to stay still, but they’d cut me loose after a week, send me home with a rattling bottle. I’d be okay for a stretch—weeks, sometimes months—then I’d blink out, wake up strapped down again, and they’d shove something new at me.

By 12, the pills were blue—fat, waxy slugs that burned going down, tasting like battery acid and regret. My skin itched like it was peeling from the inside, and the ward’s scuffed beige tiles started to warp in my eyes, dripping like candle wax. Voices slipped in—low, wet murmurs, bubbling about shadows swallowing me whole. The doctors, in their crisp white coats and tight-lipped smiles, called it “stabilization,” said I was “coming around.” I’d beg them to stop, voice hoarse, tears streaking my face, but they’d adjust their pens, scratch more notes, and wheel in the next dose. The stays dragged on—two weeks, a month, four—and the meds turned vicious. Yellow capsules, oily and rancid, made my eyes jerk like they’d burst; red tablets, sharp as iron filings, filled my nights with dreams of clawing hands and endless, dripping dark.

Now I’m 16, and it’s a hell I can’t claw out of. I’ve been stuck here forever, maybe a year—time’s a smear of locked doors, barred windows fogged with grime, and the constant drone of intercoms spitting static. Last time, they handed me gray pills—thumb-sized beasts, gritty and ashen, tasting like charred rubber and rusting nails. I gag them down, and my head’s a battlefield: shadows twist in the corners, tall and jagged, their edges bleeding into the plaster; footsteps stalk me, slow and heavy, thudding through the silence of my cell. My tongue’s bloated, clumsy, my hands tremble so bad this pencil’s a fight to hold. The voices are a storm now—screaming, scraping my skull, whispering that my veins are clotting, my skin’s sloughing off.

I can see it’s bullshit, but my head’s blind to that. The jolt of adrenaline twists me up, shoving me straight into a screaming panic. Yesterday, they rolled in a syringe—thick yellow sludge, stinking of sulfur and rot, plunged into my arm with a sting like boiling oil. I blacked out, woke up with my wrists raw, blood crusting the straps, nails snapped from clawing the metal cot. The doctor just smirked, his pen clicking, “Good response.”

I don’t know why this keeps happening. I’ve screamed for answers—throat ragged, spit flying—but they just trade glances, mutter about “delusions” and “self-harm risk.” My past is a fog; I can’t pin down what sends me back here every time. I tried breaking out once—jimmied the lock with a bent spoon, sprinted down the hall, bare feet slapping icy tile—but the orderlies tackled me, their meaty arms crushing my ribs, a needle sinking in ‘til my knees folded and the world spun black. I’m fracturing, I feel it—my mind’s splitting, sharp and brittle—but it’s not me. It’s them, the pills, the shots, the way they’re grinding me down. I just want it to end.

I opened my eyes today, and it’s like the world shifted.. crooked, off, not mine. No cell, no restraints, just a bedroom, small and musty, with floral wallpaper peeling like blistered skin, a stained mattress slumped against a wall thick with dust and spiderwebs. My arms are a mess. Deep scratches crisscrossing the skin, scabs flaking off, my nails caked with blood and something grainy, like sand. A bottle of bleach was left on the nightstand—cap off, half-drained, its plastic dented—beside a chipped ceramic mug streaked with white crust. My mouth’s a chemical blaze—sharp, acrid, like I’ve been chugging gasoline. I lurched to the bathroom, a coffin of cracked tile and rusted pipes, and heaved—green foam, bitter and frothy, splashed the sink, tinged with streaks of pink. Under it, a hoard of bottles: ammonia, its cap crusted yellow, fumes stinging my eyes; drain cleaner, label curling off, a puddle of brown sludge around it; Windex, blue rivulets staining the cabinet—all uncapped, all half-used. My head’s pounding, but it’s clearing, jagged pieces slamming into place.

I live with Aunt Ruth. She’s 73, brittle as twigs, her back bowed under a threadbare housecoat, her voice a dry rasp always fretting about how I’ve been “strange” since my parents disappeared when I was 11. They didn’t die, didn’t leave—just vanished one night, no note, no trace, their car still in the drive. Aunt took me in, her house a crumbling relic—moth-eaten curtains, a kitchen sink that drips rust. She’d pat my head, her hands trembling, saying I was just shaken by it, that I’d grow out of the “odd spells.” But it’s rushing back now, vivid as a blade. The medicine cabinet in our old place—Mom’s painkillers, Dad’s antacids, a jumble of bright little promises that always seemed to be waiting for me when they were gone. I’d find them in my hands, dry and sharp on my tongue, though I can’t swear I was the one who took them. Bleach in the laundry room, its cap crusted and sticky like it’d been left out for me; Lysol from the pantry, floral and stinging, half-empty before I got there; turpentine in the garage, oily and thick, sitting too close to the door. They’d end up in my juice cups, mixed and swirling—I’d drink, or maybe it was poured for me—my stomach twisting, my head catching fire, colors smearing, walls pulsing, voices snickering through the haze. I don’t know if I did it, or if something wanted me to.

I think I’ve been dosing myself ever since; sipping bleach in the dark ‘til my throat blistered, chugging ammonia ‘til my eyes watered, swigging Windex like it’s water, chasing that warped, electric haze. The wards, the doctors, the meds… it was all in my head, spun from poison and a kid’s dumb curiosity. I’ve been here, in Aunt’s decaying house, rotting myself alive, clawing my skin ‘til it bled, hearing whispers that never existed. She’d find me zoned out, mumbling, and just sigh, thinking it was grief. I’m not locked up. I couldn’t have been. I’ve been free, breaking myself, hallucinating every strap, every pill. But I can’t keep this up. I can’t face her soft, “Oh, Ethan,” knowing I’ve been drowning in my own mess.

I need answers. None of this makes sense. I walked to the county psych ward today, shoes off, the asphalt rough and cold under my feet. I can’t drive, but luckily it was only a few blocks away. I told the nurse at the desk everything—the cleaners, the voices, the years I’ve lost to my own hands. Her eyes widened, her pen hovering, then she buzzed security. They locked me in—real this time, I told myself. But it’s identical: same white walls, faintly yellowed and chipped; same flickering lights, humming like a swarm; same bleach stink, sharp and clinging. The doctor’s here—glasses fogged, mint gum snapping, holding a gray pill, big as my thumb, gritty as ash. I took it, felt the burn crawl down my throat, and the shadows stirred—tall, crooked, grinning from the corners. The voices laughed, my own echo twisted back at me, mocking. I poisoned myself, built this prison in my head, checked in to escape—but this ward’s too exact, too much like my supposed hallucinations. Was I ever out? Was it ever fake? I’m exhausted. The walls are melting again, just like they always did.

The gray pill’s taste clings to my tongue, bitter and ashen, when the door creaks open. Mom walks in first—her floral apron creased, hair swept back in that neat bun she always wore, a gentle smile curving her mouth. Dad follows, his broad frame filling the doorway, work boots scraping the tile, sawdust dusting his faded jeans. “Ethan,” Mom says, her voice warm like Sunday mornings, “we’ve been waiting for you.” Dad grunts, steady as ever: “Let’s go home, kid.” My body locks up, breath trapped in my lungs, every nerve screaming to run but I can’t—frozen stiff, staring, as they close the gap, the room’s bleach tang blending with the soft lavender of Mom’s soap.
