Adam and Lily were walking together at the park on a quiet afternoon. Though they had been dating for a couple of years, Adam couldn’t shake his reservations about Lily’s dog, Max. The dog had been part of her life for 14 years, and Lily loved him deeply. But Adam didn’t share that connection. He didn’t understand why she felt so strongly about Max, especially now that they were moving in together.

Lily had asked if Max could live with them once they moved into Adam’s apartment, and he’d hesitated. He had nothing against dogs—just not that dog. Max was old, and Adam couldn’t fathom why he was so important to her. She had a special bond with him, but Adam felt it was unnecessary to carry that baggage into their new life together.

As they walked through the dog park, Lily tried to convince Adam of Max’s worth, arguing that he would be a good companion and protector of their home. But Adam grew frustrated, his patience thinning. “Do you really think a dog like that is going to be any help? They’re vicious creatures, especially when you’ve been babying him all these years,” he snapped.

Lily froze, shocked by his words. How could he say such a thing about Max, the dog who had always been by her side? Max had been there through everything: bad grades, broken hearts, the isolation with her parents. He was more than just a dog—he was family.

“Max is not like that!” Lily shouted, her voice shaking with anger. “He’s the most well-behaved dog I know!”

Adam’s response was cold. “If he’s so great, where is he now?”

Lily’s stomach dropped as she turned around. Max was nowhere in sight. Panic crept into her chest as she called out, “Max! Max!”

They both began searching, calling his name, but the dog was nowhere to be found. As the sun began to set, Lily’s concern turned to dread. Hours passed, and they both agreed to split up, continuing their search in the fading light.

Adam walked in silence, his mind racing. The real reason he’d reacted so strongly wasn’t just about Max—it was fear. When he was a child, a dog had attacked him after he’d climbed a fence as part of a dare. The scars from that encounter had never truly healed, and every time he saw a dog, a part of him still flinched in fear.

Meanwhile, Lily was consumed by both worry and anger. She couldn’t understand why Adam wouldn’t try to see things from her perspective. Max had been her rock, her constant companion. How could he not get it?

As the last rays of sunlight faded, they met back at their starting point. Adam, exhausted and frustrated, suggested they go home for the night and return in the morning. But Lily, overcome with emotion, snapped. “Just go home, and don’t ever call me again!” Her voice cracked, her heart torn between fear and the sting of Adam’s cruelty.

Adam didn’t argue. He simply left.

But as he drove away, something caught his eye in the rearview mirror. He thought he saw Max—was that him? Adam’s heart skipped a beat. Hesitating, he pulled over and got out, deciding to check it out.

Lily, still searching, hadn’t noticed his return. The woods around her were growing darker, and an unsettling chill had settled in. Then, in the distance, she saw Adam walking through the trees.

Relief flooded her, thinking that Adam had come back to help. But as she approached, something felt… off. Adam was moving slowly, his steps unnaturally deliberate, as though he was being pulled somewhere. The air had grown colder, and Lily’s unease deepened.

She stopped in her tracks, her stomach knotting. The figure ahead of her wasn’t Adam—it was something else. Someone—or something—watching her with unnerving stillness.

Adam, who had been walking ahead, froze and suddenly turned. His pace quickened, as though something invisible was urging him back to the path. Panic flickered in his eyes.

Lily, shaking, called out to him, but he didn’t respond. The figure remained behind them, moving with unnatural precision, never far, but never quite visible either.

“What’s wrong?” Lily’s voice trembled with confusion and fear. “Why are you acting like this?”

Adam didn’t answer. He was breathing heavily, his face pale as he hurried toward the car. Lily followed, the cold terror gripping her chest. They finally reached the car, slamming the doors shut behind them. But just as they settled in, a thud—heavy, unnerving—came from above the car.

Lily’s breath hitched. “What was that?”

Adam’s eyes darted to the rearview mirror, his voice tight with dread. “It’s still out there.”

Lily frowned, confused. “What are you talking about?”

Before she could say anything else, Adam slammed the car into gear and floored it, speeding away from the woods. The thumping above them followed, relentless and steady, until it suddenly stopped.

The air in the car felt suffocating as they neared the city. Neither of them spoke, both of them shaken, too unsettled to put into words what had just happened.

Lily broke the silence. “Is Max… dead?”

There was a long pause. Adam didn’t answer, his gaze fixed on the road. Then, from the back seat, a voice, low and chilling, whispered, “No.”

Lily whipped around, her heart pounding. The back seat was empty, but she could feel it—the presence of something that didn’t belong. The figure she had seen earlier was there, sitting in the back seats, its unnatural grin widening.

Adam’s knuckles whitened as he gripped the steering wheel. “That wasn’t Max,” he whispered, his voice shaking. “That thing… it’s been following me.”

Lily’s blood ran cold. “What do you mean?”

Adam didn’t respond. His eyes were wide with fear as he locked his gaze on the road. The creature in the rearview mirror grinned again, its smile stretching impossibly wide.

Lily’s heart pounded in her chest as she watched Adam, his face twisted in terror. She turned back to the mirror, but the thing was gone. Still, the unsettling feeling lingered.

“Adam,” she whispered, her voice shaking. “What’s happening?”

But Adam didn’t answer. His grip on the wheel tightened, and he kept his eyes on the road ahead, as if staring into the very dark unknown.

In the reflection, the creature’s smile grew even wider.
