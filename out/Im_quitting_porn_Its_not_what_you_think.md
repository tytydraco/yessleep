*WARNING: This is kind of humiliating for me to post. However, the situation has gotten so out of hand, that I feel some level of sacrifice must be had to bring forth a solution. So here goes.*

I've always struggled with pornography. Not in any sort of crazy way, but usually succumbing to it once a day. Which, to me, always felt unhealthy. Fairly early on it stopped feeling like any sort of genuine sexual release. More like a habit that had to be fed; a routine which manufactured a sort of second wind at the mid-point of each day.

I've never been a particularly kinky guy. Sure I'll occasionally venture outside the basic categories, but generally I'm just watching a guy + gal get down to business. I almost always skip the foreplay; straight to the action. I keep it quick, out of preference.

Anyways, my problem all sort of began with a new trend I came across on my go-to site (very likely the same as yours). These fake 'Snapchat' style videos. I'll always remember that first thumbnail. A curvy white girl with a yellow KÃ¥nken backpack bent over her dorm-room desk.

**"COLLEGE GIRLS DO ANYTHING ON SNAP- VOL 1"**

Vertical videos, seemingly filmed within the Snapchat app, of some frat bro recording himself banging gorgeous, typically faceless, women. There'd always be some quippy Snapchat style caption plastered over the bottom like "can't believe I'm fucking my teach" or "your girl's getting quite the workout bro" ... you get the idea.

Despite their efforts to come off as amateur, real-life encounters, it was fairly clear they were fake. The lighting & camera quality was always too good, and some of the camera angles would clearly require an additional appendage from our 'protagonist'. That said, in the heat of the moment, it wasn't hard to believe; and so for the next few weeks, I plugged through the series.

To clarify: despite my above criticisms, I really *loved* these videos. I'm a college dropout. So I think it allowed me to fill some imaginary void of what a sex-fueled college experience could have been like.

Idk man. It was porn. Business as usual.

Until... Volume 9.

I had just gotten home from Planet Fitness (don't make fun of me), and I was ready to unwind for the day. Took a shower, laid out on my bed, and prepared for my afternoon ritual.

I'm a little bit OCD, so when I couldn't find Volume 9 of COLLEGE GIRLS DO ANYTHING ON SNAP, I was a bit irritated. It's not like there was an ongoing story or anything. I just prefer order, even in the more shameful, secret, parts of my life. I returned to Volume 8 and noticed the watermark over the bottom right hand of the video. It read: SnapCamz.com.

I punched it into my search bar and the website populated. It seemed so... empty. Like it wasn't complete. No search bar, no navigation menu. Only a single carousel of videos in the center of the page. No thumbnails yet; it seemed to have a sluggish time loading. I sat impatiently. The suspense was killing me.

Suddenly, a flurry of pop-ups and spam began to infect the landing page. I began closing them rapidly. I was starting to reconsider if this whole expedition was really worth it. However, with each pop-up closed, a little more of the carousel's newly generated thumbnails were revealed, giving me hope that I'd find what I was looking for after all.

Tap. Scroll. Vol 1, 2, 3, 4 ... Tap. Scroll. Vol 5, 6, 7, 8 ... Bam. There it was.

**"COLLEGE GIRLS DO ANYTHING ON SNAP- VOL 9"**

I dramatically lifted my finger and tapped the video, only to come to the frustrating realization that **I had to create an account to watch it.**

**FUCKING-A!**

I had never had to make an account on a site like this before, I really felt like I was hitting a new low. I quickly punched in a username and password I'd never remember. I hated the idea of my digital footprint on a site like this... Whatever, I'd delete the account after this video, I saw Vol. 10 and onward were available on my typical site. This would just be a one time thing.

Their terms & conditions may as well been *War & Peace;* it was so long.  
Scroll. Scroll. Accept. Date. Birth. Sign. Click. Done.

*aannndd* finally. I hit play.

The video started up. A young girl, probably early 20's, beautiful perfect skin, short bob-cut brunette hair with glistening hazel eyes sat on the edge of a dorm room bed (a little thick in all the right places too, my favorite). I took some relief that all this effort at least led to a winner. However, it was a bit strange that you could see her face, as that was a first for this series. Additionally, there was no 'Snapchat caption' on this video which I thought took away from the illusion that I came to love about this series. Oh well, I had entered my date of fucking birth to get here , I wasn't about to click off now.

I began my routine as she did hers.

She really was gorgeous. I tried to fantasize about situations that would put me in a position like this. How I could potentially be inside that room, inside... *her*. It was working. I was really falling into the trance of Vol 9.

However, about 60 seconds in, to my surprise... she spoke.

Just one word.

"Sid".

Of course it could have just been the name of the guy she was screwing.

But that's also *my name*.

At first, I welcomed the seeming coincidence. I mean, this was basically gold for my deepening fantasy. She said it again and again. I was getting close, fast. I shut my eyes. Focusing on her voice. "Sid... Sid.... Sid...."

But the next time she said it... was different. Her voice was LOUD. Like a scream, crackling out of the tinny speakers on my iPhone SE. In retrospect, it was reminiscent of the scream from the 'Scary Car Commercial' if anyone remembers that. So yah, naturally I was pretty startled.

My eyes shot open, expecting to see some horrifying or grotesque pop-up image. But nope. Just that same beautiful woman, bouncing up and down as gracefully as she was before. Her face seemed sort of expressionless; deadpan. But she was looking directly into the camera and that'd always been a big turn on for me. I loved to pretend I was looking right back, direct eye contact through the screen. I chalked the sound up to a glitch, or something loud outside my apartment. I tried to get started again.

Back into a rhythm, blurring the pixels that composed her bright green eyes, I could feel myself gradually getting closer and closer...

But as I did, I couldn't help but notice the complexion of her face gradually shifting.

It almost seemed like the video was lagging, as certain frames would slow down and then speed up again.

But, that wasn't even the strange part.

During these warps in time, her face appeared to twist in ways that seemed... inhuman.  
I assumed it was a glitch, so I just closed my eyes again.

I had shit to do today, and needed to just put a bow on this.

I knew I was close, I could finish without the visual.

**"SID"**

My eyes forced open on impulse. If the video had been buffering, it had now slowed to a crawl. Each frame ticked onward ominously, her face slowly inching closer and closer to the camera. I remember feeling a weightlessness like I was floating. That didn't last.

In no more than a second, the girl's face morphed effortlessly into a **hellish flash of pure evil**.

That face has been burned into my fucking mind ever since.

Her eyes exploded into red blurry saucers.

Her mouth tore open; a circular pool of cosmic black.

The video froze on this image and, without warning, a sharp high pitched tone rattled out of my phone into my eardrums. I was paralyzed.

I dropped my phone to the ground, pulled my underwear up, and waddled to the opposite side of my bedroom. I stared at my phone from across the room. Just sitting there, ringing, face down on the floor, until it stopped.

To be as vulnerable as you are, at the edge of climaxing... and then to instantaneously freefall into the throes of absolute terror is something I would never wish upon my worst enemy.

Yet there I was, heart beating out of my chest, jeans wrapped around my ankles.  
(also the early pains of blue balls ðŸ˜–)

I decided then and there: I was done with pornography.

At that time, I didn't tell anyone about the incident. I chalked it up to some kind of weird prank akin to 'Scary Car' or the 'The Blue Maze Game'. It certainly wasn't the first time I'd been scared half to death by some online troll.

Though, the gnawing feeling that it was something more sinister never fully escaped me. She said my name; and the way her face deformed... it felt beyond anything I'd ever witnessed.

But I didn't want to go full schizo, so I tried to move on.

That is... until I felt the urge to take care of myself again.

It had admittedly been a while since I had 'done the deed' without the aid of my incognito browser. However, I thought perhaps it was better to start using my imagination again, probably healthier for my little brain anyways.

Wrong.

Started out fine. My mind's 'spank bank' is mostly comprised of sexual memories from my early, more wild ventures. One night stands, big tits, fucking in weird places... you get the idea. So off I went, back into the mind of my 19 year old self, reimagining (and likely re-enhancing) an old memory with me and an ex. We'll call her Ruby.

I had forgotten how much better this was than porn. By re-accessing old memories, fully immersing yourself was simply a matter of focus and commitment to context. At 19, I had just broken up with my first girlfriend, and had basically thought it impossible I would find romance again. So on that particular night with Ruby, my heart was racing, I felt rejuvenated. "I can't believe this is happening..." I would've thought to myself. I began to visualize her bedroom, the sheets on her mattress, and of course... *her*.

This was fun. I could feel myself getting close now.

**"SID"**

That all too familiar shriek of my name sent shivers down my spine.

My eyes tried to open like before... but this time they couldn't.

It was like, I was really there now, in Ruby's bedroom.

As if I swam so deep into the pool of my fantasy that I could no longer locate the surface.

Disoriented, I looked down at my naked body. Young and frail, my ribcage protruded out from under my chest. Was I 19 again? I looked at Ruby's young supple body, her breasts perfectly round. A newfound excitement crackled through my body like fireworks. The thick veil of nostalgia suffocated my short-term memory, the shrill scream of my name that had just shook me, was ejected from my train of thought almost instantly at the thought of re-living this moment with such clarity.

We proceeded. It was ecstasy.

It felt like hours. Our motions were effortless and fluid, as though everything around us, only existed to contextualize the magnificent act that was transpiring between our flesh.

However, whenever I felt close... prickles of fear would crackle down the back of my spine.

But when you're in a state of such sexual euphoria, it can be comically simple to dupe yourself. To act as though you have agency, that you know what you want. When in fact, thirty seconds later you'll often be recounting everything you would've wished you'd done differently.

I allowed myself the misguided confidence to push past my fear. But as soon as I did, sooo close to hearing heavenly trumpets, her face began to shift... warp...

The room slowly began wrapping around me like a parachute. As though my eyes had melted away and fish-eye lenses grew in their place. My stomach seized into a cluster of painful knots. I knew it was coming. One final thrust to try and finish. To escape.

Too late.

Her eyes, expanded into bloodshot discs the size of massive dinner plates.

Her mouth, gaped open, revealing a bottomless hole of inky black.

My body froze like a block of ice; the stabbing high tone of the frequency from hell, ringing throughout the room like a siren's whine.

My eyes felt like they were being pulled into hers; two blackholes. Completely nude, in the body of my teenage self, I surrendered utter and complete control of my mind.

I tell you now: I had no choice.

Her vicious whirlpool enveloped me, and for a moment... I was gone.

My being suspended. Thoughts flatlined. Only my body can remember this moment.

But like being torn from the deep waters of baptism, I felt my essence shatter up and through the surface of my own reality once again. My eyelids rose from the dead; the blurry sight of my living room revealed. Laid up on my couch, completely out of breath, I slowly began to regain my bearings.

I sat up, went to the bathroom, and splashed some cold water on my face. I felt something coming up and sat down over the toilet. I waited and waited, but nothing. I gave up, and sat on the bathroom floor, observing the drips leaking from the shower head.

Drip. Drip. Drip.

I became so sharply attuned to the sound.

Drip. Drip. Drip.

I didn't know it then, but I was experiencing a level of anxiety I had never experienced before.

I held my hand up to my jaw, to stop my teeth from chattering.

Then I wept.

Shortly after, my girlfriend Natasha came home. The bathroom door was wide open so she noticed me immediately. She rushed over to console me.

"Hey... what's the matter? Are you feeling alright?"

What could I say? I felt imprisoned by my shame. I felt silenced by the horror.

Fuck, even now I feel ashamed that I failed to mention that I have a Girlfriend until this point in my re-counting of all this. Another bad habit I hope to break.

(I guess It's also worth noting, that she suffers from dyspareunia, which makes penetration a bitch for her. It's definitely a contributing factor to my bad habits. Obviously, its not completely her fault but you get the idea. I suck. Ugh.)

*ANYWAYS*

I've never gone to therapy, but I began seriously considering it after what happened with 'Ruby'. There was clearly something wrong with me, and I wasn't so confident a check-up with the doc was going to prove helpful. I have a friend, Carlos, I trust him more than anyone. We've never met in person, but we chat over Discord basically every day. I shot him a message, somewhat vaguely explaining my situation. Basically saying I was having problems with... anxiety while pleasuring myself.

I was relieved for a moment when he told me he actually had experienced some similar problems himself, and even more when he claimed he'd overcome it. He sent me a video that he said "totally changed my life bro".

**NOFAP ACTIVATES YOUR ALPHA NATURE (TAKE NOTES)**

Despite its sort of ridiculous title, the video seemed to make some interesting points regarding the benefits of 'semen retention'. It helped me understand that, not only do I have the option to stop masturbating all together, but that it could even provide some health benefits. It seemed like the straightforward and potentially beneficial solution to my problem. So, I figured I'd give it a shot.

Proud to report: I haven't came in *16 months...*

...and to be honest with you, I feel a **lot** better!

The beginning was fucking hard, but over time, the urge became less and less. Of course I get the urge every now and then, but the fear of what could happen *if I did* always makes it an easy idea to turn down.  Admittedly during this time I had to block the real Ruby out of my life completely. Deleted her number, blocked her on all socials, even skipped my 10 year high school reunion ðŸ˜…

I just don't think I could muster the strength to see her face again.

On the flipside, my relationship with Natasha began to significantly improve. We felt closer. I even committed to learning some new methods to pleasure her that didn't involve penetration (I would argue this has actually improved our sex life, as it'd always been a preference of hers that I too often ignored).

So yah. All is well right?

Sort of.

Natasha and I got married 3 months ago. She wants kids; so do I.

We want to see little babies with our eyes in 'em.

And so now I come to you, reader, stricken with a growing sickness.

Of dread, paranoia; uncertainty for my future. For *our future.*

If during attempts to conceive our child, I had to see my wife... the mother of my future children.... if I had to see her face twist into that tortuous gaze... I'm not sure how I would go on. I couldn't even bare seeing an Instagram photo of Ruby. Hell even, seeing a KÃ¥nken backup makes me shudder.

Our pure untainted love, tarnished with the mark of some hideous... *beast.*

If anyone here has any advice or questions, I'm all ears.

I'm not posting here to whine into the void. I am in search of a solution.
