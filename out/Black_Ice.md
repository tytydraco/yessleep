I remember it vividly. The cold seeped into my bones as the gray sky pressed down on the world. The highway stretched ahead of me like a long, endless ribbon, flanked by trees sagging under the weight of winter's wrath. It had been snowing earlier, but now the storm had passed, leaving behind a deadly calm.

I was driving home after a late shift, my car’s heater doing little to combat the chill creeping in through the cracks. The clock on the dashboard read 11:37 PM. The road was nearly deserted, save for a few taillights blinking in the distance. I should have been paying closer attention, but I was tired, my mind wandering as the tires hummed beneath me.

The first warning came in the form of a faint, almost imperceptible shimmer on the asphalt. Black ice. I knew I should slow down, but the realization hit me a split second too late. My tires lost traction. The car began to drift, the steering wheel suddenly feeling useless in my hands.

Panic surged through me like a jolt of electricity. I turned the wheel to counter the slide, but the car spun instead, skidding sideways. The world became a blur of headlights and shadows, the trees on the roadside looming like skeletal sentinels.

Then came the impact. A sickening crunch of metal against metal as I collided with the guardrail. The force of it snapped my head forward, the seatbelt cutting into my shoulder. The car shuddered to a stop, but not before the passenger-side tires dipped off the edge of the icy shoulder. I realized with growing dread that the guardrail had given way. My car teetered precariously, the abyss of a steep embankment yawning beneath me.

My breathing was shallow and rapid as I reached for my phone with trembling hands. The screen lit up, but there was no signal. I cursed under my breath, the silence of the night now oppressive. I could hear the groan of the metal beneath the car as it shifted ever so slightly. I had to get out before it tipped over completely.

Unclipping the seatbelt, I moved slowly, terrified that the slightest motion would send the car tumbling. My heart was hammering so loudly I thought it might drown out my thoughts. The door was stuck, the crumpled frame refusing to budge. Desperation took over as I shoved at it with all my strength, and finally, it gave way with a screech.

I stepped out onto the icy shoulder, slipping and catching myself on the crumpled hood. I barely had time to breathe a sigh of relief before a sound froze me in place.

Crunch.

It wasn’t the car. It wasn’t the ice under my boots. It came from the woods, just beyond the highway. A slow, deliberate crunch, like footsteps on frozen ground. My breath caught in my throat as I strained to see into the darkness.

“Hello?” I called, my voice barely audible over the wind.

Nothing.

Then, again—crunch. Closer this time. My pulse quickened, my body instinctively moving back toward the car. The embankment behind me was a steep, black void, and the highway ahead stretched into nothingness. I was trapped.

And then I saw it. A figure emerging from the treeline, its silhouette stark against the snow. It was tall, impossibly tall, and its movements were jerky, unnatural. My legs felt like lead as it drew closer, the dim light from my car’s broken headlights illuminating its pale, featureless face.

I stumbled backward, my foot slipping on the ice. I fell hard, the breath knocked out of me as the figure loomed over me. It didn’t speak, didn’t move, just stared down with empty sockets where eyes should have been.

I scrambled to my feet, my mind racing. The car was still perched precariously on the edge, but it was my only refuge. I threw myself into the driver’s seat, slamming the door shut and locking it. The figure didn’t follow. It just stood there, motionless, as I sat trembling inside the car.

And then the car began to shift. The weight of my frantic movements had been too much. I felt the sickening lurch as it tipped forward, the ground vanishing beneath me. My scream was swallowed by the night as the car plummeted into the darkness below.

I don’t remember hitting the bottom. All I remember is waking up to silence, the world upside down and shattered glass all around me. The figure was gone, but I could still feel its presence, lingering just out of sight. Watching. Waiting.

And every now and then, when I drive that stretch of highway, I swear I see it standing in the trees, its empty face turned toward me.
