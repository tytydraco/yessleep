The cold was biting, the kind that sneaks through your coat and wraps its claws around your bones. I was driving home late that night, the roads eerily quiet, blanketed in a sheen of ice that reflected the pale glow of the moon. The weather report had warned about black ice, but I thought I’d be fine—I'd driven these roads countless times before.

My hands gripped the steering wheel tighter than usual, and my headlights barely cut through the fog rolling across the road. The heater was blasting, but my fingers were still numb, trembling slightly from both the cold and a gnawing sense of unease.

Then, it happened.

At first, it was subtle—a slight shift in the car's traction. The wheels didn't seem to grip the road. My heart skipped a beat, and I instinctively tapped the brakes. That was my mistake. The car lurched violently, spinning out as if it had a mind of its own. Everything slowed down, but my heart raced, pounding like a war drum in my chest.

The world outside became a blur of headlights, icy darkness, and skeletal tree branches. The car twisted and slid toward the shoulder, and my mind screamed for control, but I had none. My attempts to steer only made it worse.

Then I saw it: a hulking shadow ahead, illuminated briefly by my spiraling headlights. A massive oak tree loomed, its gnarled branches stretching toward me like claws. Time snapped back to reality. The crunching, grinding noise of metal against ice filled my ears as the car collided with the tree. The impact was jarring, the force slamming me forward into my seatbelt. My breath left me in a sharp, agonized gasp.

The silence afterward was deafening. My head throbbed, and my vision blurred. Steam hissed from the crumpled hood, rising into the frigid air. The shattered windshield looked like a spiderweb, tiny shards of glass glistening under the faint light. I reached up to touch my face and winced as I felt the sticky warmth of blood trickling down from a gash on my forehead.

As I tried to steady my breathing, I became aware of another sound—soft, almost imperceptible. At first, I thought it was the wind whistling through the broken glass. But no. It was something else. A low, guttural moan.

I froze, every muscle locking into place. The sound was coming from outside the car. My eyes darted toward the passenger-side window, where the darkness seemed to shift and swell. A shadow moved—a silhouette, tall and gaunt, its movements unnatural, jerky. It was coming closer.

My pulse thundered in my ears as the figure reached the car, its face obscured by the foggy night. I couldn’t look away. My mind screamed at me to move, to run, but my body refused to obey.

Then it pressed its hand—if you could call it a hand—against the shattered glass. Long, bony fingers, ending in sharp, cracked nails, dragged slowly across the surface, making a sound like nails on a chalkboard. My breath hitched, visible in short, panicked puffs.

I closed my eyes, praying it would go away. When I opened them, the thing was gone. But the moaning hadn’t stopped. It was closer now, right by my ear.

I screamed, fumbling with the seatbelt, wrenching it free. I threw the door open and stumbled out into the biting cold, my boots slipping on the icy ground. I looked around, desperate to find the source of the sound, but there was nothing—only the twisted wreck of my car and the looming trees.

And then I saw it. In the distance, among the shadows, those same bony fingers curling around a tree trunk, the figure watching me with glowing, hollow eyes.

I ran.
