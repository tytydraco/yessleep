I’m writing this because they won’t let me talk about it anymore.

They say putting it down “feeds the delusion,” but if I don’t write it, I feel like I’m going to tear myself apart from the inside. I need someone to know what really happened out there—because it wasn’t murder, and it wasn’t madness.

It was contact.

We chose the woods because of the stories. Hikers disappearing. Campers hearing voices that mimicked their friends. Watches stopping. Phones draining to nothing in minutes. We told ourselves it was folklore, mass hysteria, bored locals winding people up.

There were four of us. We went in laughing.

By the time the sun set, the woods had changed.

The silence came first. No insects. No owls. Even our footsteps sounded muted, like the ground was swallowing the noise. We built a fire anyway, trying to keep the mood light, but the flames burned oddly—too low, too blue.

That was when we saw the light.

Not in the sky.

*Behind* the trees.

It wasn’t a beam. It didn’t move like a torch or headlights. It pulsed, slow and deliberate, as if something enormous was breathing just out of sight. Every time it brightened, the shadows rearranged themselves.

We should have ran.

Instead, we went to our tents.

The footsteps started almost immediately. Not crashing through undergrowth, not random. Precise. Measured. Like something mapping us. Occasionally, the sound would stop, and the air would hum—so faint I felt it more than heard it, vibrating through my ribs.

Then the voices began.

Perfect copies. My voice calling Ellie’s name. Mark laughing, somewhere close. Tom begging us to help him.

In the morning, Mark was gone.

His tent hadn’t been opened. The ground around it was smooth, flattened in a wide circle, as if something heavy had pressed down from above. His watch lay in the centre, cracked and permanently stopped at 2:17 a.m.

Ellie was next.

She stood staring up at the trees, mouth hanging open, eyes reflecting something I couldn’t see. When I grabbed her arm, she screamed—not in pain, but like she’d realised something too late.

She rose without being touched.

Just lifted. Slowly. Silently.

Straight up into the canopy.

There were no branches breaking. No struggle. Just the sound of her screaming fading into nothing.

By the second night, I knew what was happening.

We weren’t being hunted.

We were being *collected*.

The light came back, stronger this time. The air felt thin, wrong. Tom ran. The hum spiked, and he collapsed mid-step, body jerking like every nerve had been switched on at once. Then he was gone too—pulled upwards so fast I barely saw it.

I don’t know why I was spared.

They found me two days later, wandering barefoot near the road, clothes burned in places, skin marked with strange, perfectly symmetrical bruises. The campsite was there, but everything metallic was warped, melted slightly, like it had been exposed to intense heat.

No bodies.

No blood.

They say I killed them.

They say I imagined the lights, the voices, the way Ellie floated into the trees.

Last night, a nurse asked me to stand barefoot on the cold floor and hum along with the sound in the walls. I didn’t remember agreeing, but my body did it anyway.

She smiled, made a note on her tablet, and said, “Good. You’re adapting faster than the others.”
