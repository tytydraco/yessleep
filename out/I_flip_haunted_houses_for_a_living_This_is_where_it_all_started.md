——————————————————————————

A few of you asked me to start at the beginning, and I guess that’s fair. This story is going longer than my last one but that’s because it needs slightly more context. Meadow Lane wasn’t the first house I ever worked on—just one of the ones that left scars I still carry. The truth is, my first house wasn’t half as big or half as fancy. It was a foreclosure on Sycamore Street, small enough to disappear into the neighborhood if you weren’t looking. I thought it was going to be an easy job. I was wrong. That house was the reason I stopped laughing at ghost stories. It was the reason I started carrying extra things in my toolbox that had nothing to do with fixing houses. 

It was also the first place I worked with my partner, Stanley. We weren’t friends then—my realtor just passed me his number, said he was short on work and good with his hands. Simple as that. But looking back, I know one thing for certain: without Stanley, I wouldn’t be here to tell you this story.

The home itself was a one story, 2 bed, 1 bath. It wasn’t anything fancy or grand, but just enough for a family of 2 or 3. If there’s anything I’ve learned though, the small houses where the average person lives—that’s where the trouble is. People trying to live day by day and make it through their life causes a lot of stress and anxiety. That usually lures spirits to the house. Eventually spiritual energy builds—enough to split the seams. A kind of door. I don’t know where it leads, but I know what comes through isn’t human. Although it takes decades or even centuries for doors to open, one did in that house. I wish I knew what I know now.

I pulled up to the house in my old beat-up sedan and parked it while the engine let out one last cough. In front of me sat a gray van with both back doors open. Tools lined the walls inside, hanging from screws drilled into a board, neat as a store display. Plastic bins held drill bits, screws, nails, files—everything a guy might need to take apart a house and put it back together. Someone was half-buried in the mess, leaning over a bag while rummaging around inside.

“Stanly?” I called out as I stepped out of my car.

The man turned his head as he stood up and squinted at the sunlight. He looked a few years older than me, brown hair and brown eyes with bushy eyebrows. He gave me a long look before nodding and walking towards me. “So, you’re Forrest?”

“Yeah.”

He grunted as he threw a bag over his shoulder and hopped out the back of his van. He reached his hand out and smiled as he started talking. “Pleasure to be working with you man.” 

“Same here, have you ever done this kind of thing before?”

“Plenty—foreclosures, remodels, all sorts of stuff. It never hurts to have a steady stream of work.”

I nodded “Good, this should be pretty easy then. Mostly just cosmetic stuff, floors, paint, and patchwork.”

“Easy money.” He said grinning. We hauled out bags up the porch together. The wood creaked and groaned as if it was going to fall from under us. It seemed like the whole porch needed to be re-done.

I slid my key in the lock and the door swung open. The air was almost too thick to breathe, and it carried a heavy scent of something sweet, like fruit rotting for months—or like someone left a body under the floorboards. Stanly stepped back at the smell as he waved his hand in front of his face. “We should have cracked the windows or something first.”

I tried to laugh but it came out thin and fake sounding.

The living room wasn’t in terrible shape at first glance—carpet matted and stained, wallpaper peeling in the corners, and a few pieces of furniture carelessly abandoned. Normal. Forgettable. 

But after looking around the living room, I swear the hairs on my neck started to rise. There was something about this place that felt off. There was something about this house that was different from the ones I’d done before. 

I sat my bag by the front door as I made my way to tour the rest of the house. The kitchen was almost boring compared to the living room. Dust, grime, peeling wallpaper. Looking back, I think that was its way of lulling us into a false sense of normal. Pretending it was just another job.

The hallway was narrow enough that the walls felt like they were pressing in. One door stood at the far end, shut tight, while two others waited across from each other halfway down, as if the house had been built to funnel you into the middle room.

I opened the door in front of me. The bathroom was cramped, barely wide enough to turn around in. A cracked mirror hung above a rust-stained sink, its silver backing peeling like flaking skin. The tub was ringed in black mildew, and the shower curtain clung damp and yellowed to itself, even though there hadn’t been running water in years. The air here was different too—humid, like the room was holding its breath. There was one detail that stuck out like a sore thumb—that sticky sweet smell had returned. It smelt like death now and permeated throughout the entire house. The air grew thicker and heavier as my vision stretched. 

I shut the door quickly, maybe too quickly, as if I could trap the smell inside and keep it from crawling further into the house. The click of the knob sounded sharp in the silence, echoing longer than it should have. But the smell didn’t stay locked inside. It clung to me, thick and syrupy, stronger than before. It wasn’t the usual mildew or rot these places carried—it had a sweetness that didn’t belong, like fruit left too long in the sun. The house was full of it now, but unevenly, as if the walls themselves were holding on to the stench.

“Jesus Christ, that smells horrible.” Stanly coughed as he moved the collar of his shirt over his nose.

“It definitely doesn’t smell good.”

“You think it’s a dead raccoon under the boards or mice in the wall?”

“Probably—something’s dead though, that’s for sure.” At the time I still wasn’t sold on that theory. Dead animals had a certain sharpness to their stink, but this was heavier, slower, almost like it stuck to your throat on the way down. 

“These are the 2 bedrooms then?” He looked at the 2 doors on our left and right before approaching the one on the left. 

Stanly pushed open the door and the hinges let out a horrendous groan. The room was small, barely enough for a bed and wardrobe—green wallpaper sagging from the ceiling in long strips. Mildew clung to the air, wet and sour.

He stepped inside and the silence broke with a terrible crunch. The floor wasn’t moving—it was layered. A carpet of dead roaches, beetles, and silverfish coated the boards so thick you could hardly see the wood. Their shells had gone brittle with time, cracking under his boot like glass.

Stanly froze mid-step. “Holy shit,” he muttered, lifting his foot as if afraid the corpses might cling to him.
I just stared. There must’ve been hundreds, maybe thousands, all dried and piled together in a kind of macabre ant hill.

While they were scattered across the entire room, they piled unnaturally thick in the center. Their brittle shells cracked and the floorboards groaned as Stanley shifted his weight. He turned to step out, but the crunch beneath his boot changed—softer, wetter, as if the desiccated bodies had given way to something pulpy beneath.

Stanly jerked his foot back. “That’s just disgusting—where’d they all come from?”

I didn’t answer. Because the smell was stronger now, syrupy and sticky, rising from the broken mound. And as I watched, I swore I saw the heap of carcasses settle—not slide or scatter, but sink, as though there was more beneath the floor.

I turned to Stanly as the smell hit me and threatened my balance. “I’m not going to lie, I’m not the biggest fan of this house.”

He gave a short laugh—didn’t sound too convincing. “Yeah, well still, it’s easy money. Rip up the carpet, remove the wallpaper, patch the walls, and fumigate the hell out of it, then we’re golden.” The way he shifted, careful not to step on the mound again, told me he wasn’t anymore comfortable than I was. He shut the door as he stepped out of the room and scraped his boots against the floor. 

There was only one room left, thankfully, and at first glance there was nothing out of the ordinary. A bare bed frame slumped in the corner, wood warped from years of neglect. Above it, the wallpaper had faded around a perfect rectangle, the kind of mark you’d see when a picture hung for decades and was only recently torn down. The exposed patch was darker than the rest, almost bruised-looking, like the wall itself hadn’t seen light in years.

Stanly shrugged. “At least this room isn’t too bad.”

I wanted to agree, but my eyes kept drifting back to that stain. The rest of the wall was yellowed and peeling, but that patch stayed smooth, untouched, almost like that one spot hadn’t aged at all. I shut the bedroom door as I started heading for my bag. “Let’s try to get this knocked out before the end of the week.”

Stanly nodded, brushing his hands off on his jeans. “Kitchen first?”

“Living room. Might as well make it feel like a house again before we gut it.”

We hauled our bags back to the front. The stink was still there, stubborn and cloying, but once we started cleaning and then tearing up carpet and stripping wallpaper, it was easier to ignore. Hours passed like that—me on my knees with a scraper, Stanly cursing as he wrestled the carpet free from rusted staples. Dust rose in clouds, thick enough to make my throat burn, and every time I opened a window the air outside seemed too thin, too light, compared to what sat heavy inside.

When we finally rolled up the last strip of carpet, the living room felt brighter, almost bearable. For a moment I forgot there was anything weird with the house. It was just a job again, like all the others. We even laughed when Stanly leaned on a wet spot too hard and part of the wall gave out pulling him inside.

But every time I’d manage to block it out, that sickly smell always came back. If anything, it crept closer. Every time I paused, every time the tools went quiet, I could feel it again—sweet, heavy, pressing at the back of my throat.

The kitchen went mostly the same, though it ate up more time. The tile was brittle but stubborn, clinging to the floor like it didn’t want to let go. Every swing of the hammer sent cracks spidering across the ceramic, shards skipping against the walls. Stanly worked the pry bar while I swept the pieces into a pile, the scrape of metal and the clatter of tile filling the air.

By the time we finished, the floor was bare concrete, and Stanly wiped the sweat from his brow with a muttered curse. “I’m considering buying a respirator to work in this dump,” he said.

I laughed, but it didn’t sound right, I was too tired from work and my nerves were shot because of the damned house. “It’s getting late, we should wrap up for the day.”

“Alright, I’ll pack up, if you want you can wait on me, and we can grab something to eat and talk about what’s left to do.” I couldn’t stand the smell anymore.

“Yeah, sure, I’m going to find whatever that terrible smell is though.” I made my way to the bathroom because that’s where the smell was strongest.

I entered the bathroom and the smell was still thick and sweet, maybe even worse now. It didn’t take long before I realized the smell was coming from one of the cabinets.

I crouched in front of the warped cabinet beneath the sink, the smell growing heavier the closer I got. My stomach turned, and I gagged behind my hand, but I forced myself to pull the door open.

Inside, stacked behind old bottles of bleach and a cracked jar of something I didn’t want to identify, was a small wooden box. Dark wood, no bigger than a shoebox, and wrong. It was too clean for this place, like the years hadn’t touched it. The rot hadn’t stained it. Not a speck of dust clung to its surface.

The smell rolled out in a wave. Sweet and thick. I could almost taste it.

I should’ve shut the cabinet right then. I should’ve walked away and never opened that box. But I didn’t. I picked it up. It felt warm.

The lid didn’t have hinges—it wasn’t meant to be opened easily—but when I pressed my thumbs against the edges, it gave way with a snap like breaking bone. There was a strange symbol inside that looked like a hand with an eye in the center.

The smell hit me full force, choking, sickening, and then the air shifted. The walls groaned as if the house itself breathed. The mirror spiderwebbed without being touched, and the tiles beneath my knees rattled.
It was then I realized the box wasn’t just holding the smell in.

I heard feet pounding as Stanley opened the door to the bathroom. “Are you ok? What’s going on?”

I didn’t answer at first. I couldn’t. My hands were still on the box, the lid half-open, and all I could do was stare at what seeped out. It wasn’t light or shadow, not really—it was a shimmer in the air, like heat over asphalt, bending the room in ways that made my eyes ache.

Stanley stepped inside and froze. “What the hell is that?” His voice had lost its usual weight, dropping into a whisper without him meaning to.

The smell was unbearable now, thick and cloying, pressing down on us like syrup. The walls groaned louder, and the cracked mirror split the rest of the way with a sharp snap, shards scattering into the sink.
“I—I think it was sealed,” I managed, my throat raw from the stench. “And I broke it.”

Stanley backed up a step, his shoulder knocking against the doorframe. The air around the box rippled again, wider this time, like a curtain pulling back. It wasn’t just a smell anymore—it was sound. A low, endless hum, so deep it rattled the teeth in my skull.

The tiles beneath us quivered, as though something massive was moving just beyond them.

“Forrest, put the lid back on,” Stanley hissed. “Now.”
I tried, God I tried, but the wood didn’t fit together anymore. The edges had warped, the seams bent, and the box almost seemed to push against my hands, fighting me.

That’s when I realized the smell wasn’t in the air anymore. It was in me, thick in my chest, sinking into my lungs like it wanted to stay. Somehow despite the dimensions of the box, a low humming sound came from within. 

I bent over coughing as the box fell out of my hands onto the floor. It shuttered as a blast of air flew out of the lid. It wasn’t hot or cold—it was wrong, the smell echoed through my lungs as I tried my best to force it out by coughing. 

Stanly cursed and stumbled back as the very air above the box started to distort. Like heatwaves off hot asphalt the air above the box warped and shifted—a shimmer in the air like glass bending around heat. Then it stretched, tearing wider as my ears started ringing. 

I clasped my head in my hands as I tried to regain my standing to no avail. The hum grew louder until it felt like the sound was coming from my skull. Then the walls groaned as something made its way through. It wasn’t a hand, not really, it was more like a cloud of miasma with some kind of form beneath it.

The cloud condensed into an appendage of some sort as it started forcing itself through the hole. A limb gripped onto the ceiling smearing inky black across it. A tar-like substance dripped from it as more limbs started forcing their way through. Long finger-like tendrils dragged across the tiles. They had the fluidity of water but somehow it managed to crack the foundation until it completely gave way.

“Forrest!” Stanley’s voice cracked. He grabbed my arm and yanked hard, breaking whatever spell had kept me locked in place.

But it was too late. The thing forced itself further through the opening, its form stretching and snapping as if it was learning how to exist here. A limb pressed against the ceiling, smearing more black across the plaster. Another scraped the mirror until the glass splintered into millions of tiny specs of dust. 

And then came the sound. Not a growl, not a voice—something in between, like dozens of mouths trying to say something at once but never finding the right words. The air vibrated with it, my chest seizing like my lungs wanted to collapse. My heart’s rhythm shifted as the thing got farther out of the portal. Every beat was further apart and I started to feel light headed. 

One of the tendrils snapped back and whipped my hand. My pinky and ring finger snapped as they flew off from the base. I collapsed and screamed.

Then Stanley did the only thing that made sense in that kind of terror: he kicked it. Hard. His steel-toe boot slammed into the box and sent it skidding across the tiles. The lid snapped shut with a crack like thunder, and instantly everything stopped.

Without a delay he got his phone out of his pocket and dialed 911.

The sirens grew louder as the ambulance turned onto the street, but the air between Stanley and me was thick, heavy with things unsaid. My chest still burned, my head spun, and the pain from my hand was a dull, gnawing throb. I couldn’t stop staring at the box, lying harmlessly in the corner, as if it had never tried to pull something into our world.

I swallowed hard and finally spoke, voice low and steady despite the trembling. “People live in these houses.”

Stanley looked at me, confusion and fear flickering across his face. “Yeah… they do. What are you—”

“I mean it,” I said, my throat tight. “They move in. Families. Kids. And if something like that had gotten out…” I shook my head. The thought made bile rise in my stomach. “We can’t just treat these houses like any other foreclosure. Not anymore. Someone has to handle it. Someone has to make sure no one gets hurt.”

Stanley stayed quiet for a long moment, glancing toward the box, then back at me. Finally, he nodded slowly. “Alright… alright, we’ll do it. Whatever just happened was fucked. Nobody else needs to go through it..”

I looked down at my hand, the missing fingers still raw, and the box sitting there like nothing had happened. The thought hit me fully for the first time: some houses aren’t just broken—they’re dangerous. And now, somehow, it was our job to deal with them.
