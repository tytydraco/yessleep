I need to set some precedents here. In the story below is a story that was sent to me from my friend’s email. Now this wouldn’t be abnormal in any situation but in this one my friend has been missing the past six months. It was only today, after going through emails deleting or unsubscribing from spam stuff, that I saw it. Attached were 12 audio recordings. It’s been only two hours since I listened to them and now here I am. A little backstory about my friend:



His name is Alex. He’s, embarrassing to say, a ghost hunter. He’s been to all the locations you could think of. The conjuring house, the sallie house, plenty of asylums, and Bobby's bar. He’s been everywhere. I like to, from time to time, keep up with his website. He posts his findings there and hosts his podcast show as well. Now the website is gone. I’ve looked everywhere for it and even went to that one website where you look up websites. Nothing. It was like it never existed. 



Two weeks before he went missing he posted a listing for ghost hunters and skeptics alike to join an expedition into Genesis Asylum (also named Lunatic Asylum), renamed later to Central State Hospital, located in Georgia. Not to say he was famous or anything but a few people did sign up. Then a couple weeks later they went to the Asylum and never came back. No bodies nor any remains were ever found.



One more thing. The subject that was labeled in the email read, “More incoming, be prepared. Find me.”

Alex: Hey there ghosties and ghoulies and welcome to this edition of Parascared. The podcast show where we take trips to the most known haunted places in America but today we’re doing something different! We’re going to one of the most ambiguous locations known to the haunted kind! Ooooooo! Anyways, in this episode I am joined by seven fellow hauntaneers! Jason…



Jason: Sup

Sarah:...So you said this’ll boost my viewer count?...

Zack: What?...



Alex:...David…



David: You do realize this whole thing is bullshit right?...



Alex:...And finally we have Rose…



Rose: Oh I don’t believe in ghosts either. I’m only here for the free press you mentioned on your website…



Alex:...And there you have it folks. Here’s all of our ghoulanteers! Now sit back, relax and enjoy our unedited audio adventure into Genesis Asylum.



*Click!*



Hello everyone! It’s me Alex. I’m recording this after the first hour of our adventure! I’m gonna edit this together which should only take a couple minutes to do. So let’s start with the first hour. Each of us arrived at the asylum in our own cars. No one rode with each other which is interesting. Anyways the asylum itself was two stories tall and about one and a half length of a football field. The abandoned atmosphere, which I did take pictures of, hung over the asylum like some dreaded coat or jacket. The wind added a little to the atmosphere as well.



The first to arrive after myself was Jason. He arrived in a red corvette with silver plated wheels and designs on all sides. The Nike symbol was on the doors. The car looked like a walking sponsorship. Then Daniel arrived, then Sarah, then Charlie and so on. I introduced each one on the podcast in the same order they arrived. Everyone, as they got out of each of their respective cars, looked genuinely confused, a couple looked scared, but one in particular looked disgusted. David. 



David, when he exited his vehicle took one look at the asylum, then at me, then back at the Asylum. He approached the bridge, the one connecting us to the outside world, and joined the others on it while I explained the rules. 



Alex: Ok, listen up. Several rules before we head inside. One, we stick together at all times. This place is massive and you could easily get lost inside it. Two, when inside, be sure to be careful of breaking anything. Yes it is an abandoned building, but it is still a government building and I don’t want any lawsuits or anyone getting arrested. And three, just be scared. I know some of you are skeptics but let’s still show some enthusiasm. Got it? Good, let's go. I grabbed my recording equipment and recorded the intro from earlier and afterwards I headed to the front door.



I turned and went up to the door first. Not going to lie but when I touched the doorknob to turn it, I felt chills down my spine and my feet unable to move like my body was screaming at me to not go inside. I pushed past my basic instincts and opened up the door. It creaked loudly as it swung slowly open. The smell of rot and dust, that seemed to be stuck within this place for decades, released in our faces all at once. 



Daniel: Fuck! I think it’s in my eye!



Sarah: Ew! What the hell is that smell?



Alex: Calm down guys. It’s just dust and a little bad smell.



Sarah: A little! Are you wearing a mask or something?



Alex: Yes.



I pulled on the string of my facemask I had on. Of course it didn’t completely block the smell out. 



Alex: You guys want one?



About everyone nodded with their fingers pinching their noses except for Daniel who was still rubbing his eyes. I handed everyone a mask and they each put one on. Daniel finally grabbed the mask after clearing out his eyes. After they each put on their mask I stepped inside the asylum. 



It was indeed dark, smelly, and abandoned. Everywhere you looked you saw dust piles. If you moved any object from its place you would see an outline in the dust of where that object was. The darkness we can overcome. I put the bag down beside me, a duffel bag full of supplies we would need, and I zipped open the bag and grabbed the flashlights out of it. I handed each person a flashlight followed by a thank you. Except for David. David just stared in disgust.



Alex: David if you don’t want to be here then there’s the door man.



David waved me off with his hand and shook his head at the same time.



David: No.



Alex: Why did you even want to come? I know Zack and Charlie want to be here because they’re fans of the paranormal. Sarah and Jason are here for a collab with me to get the chance to get more viewers. Daniel came because his girlfriend Rose dragged him with her because she loves excitement but you, you didn’t fill out why you wanted to join this expedition. So now I’m asking, why?



David: I have my reasons.



David coldly looked at me. It was as if I was staring into a living breathing corpse. It honestly scared the hell outta me but my anger overtook my fear and I turned and grumbled without another word to him. All seven flashlights turned on one after the other. All the lights danced around the room as if a dance concert was happening. I turned my flashlight on to complete the set and with that as well was finally able to see the old abandoned asylum interior clearly for myself.



The first thing the light focused on, when it turned on, was a sign above our heads outlining the room we were currently in: **Central State Hospital Main Lobby.** I moved my flashlight around the room like the others. It was a huge room, the size of a small auditorium, and in almost perfect symmetry there were seventeen wheelchairs. The metal rusted, the seats rotted, and the wheels were gone on most of them. As I was looking at them Zack came up behind me. 



Zack:You know what would be sick?  Wheelchair racing, yeah?



Alex: No. We can’t do any damage to this place. 



Zack: So what? It’s not like anyone inspects this place.



Alex: Wrong, someone does.



Zack: Who the hell would go out of their way to inspect a creepy old abandoned ASYLUM?



Alex: You’d be surprised. 



Zack: Yeah, whatever.



I turned away from Zack and flashed my light down three separate hallways. A hallway leading to the North Hall, one to the South Hall, and one to the East hall. You’d think there was another hall titled west hall but there were only three hallways in front of me. The north hall had a label underneath the title: **Rooms 100-130.** The south had: **Rooms 130-160.** Finally he east had: **Rooms 160-190.** There were no other labels for rooms 191-200. I assumed they were upstairs. I turned towards the others.



Alex: Alright guys, the way I see it we got three options. South, east, or north?



Sarah: South, I always trust south



Zack: North man, true north is best



Jason: Doesn’t matter to me



Daniel: Any way is fine



Rose: Any place that is the most dangerous, yeah!



Charlie: Uhh…um…West?



Alex: There is no West Charlie. Uh how about a vote?



David: North.



We all turned to David. He was standing behind the group with his arms folded. He wasn’t looking at us but at the north hallway. Staring down there. 



Alex: Alright, north it is. 



It was the only other answer that didn’t contradict itself or was too generalized. If we did vote, north would’ve won anyway and I didn’t want to argue with David all night. Everyone else shrugged and I led the way down the North hallway. 



I shined my flashlight down the hall. Rooms layered across each side appropriately labeled…**101, 102, 103,** etc. We didn’t simply pass each room. We stopped at one doorway, **101**, and opened it slowly. The dust hit my face first and I sneezed really hard, like one of those sneezes where you feel like your nose is about to fall off. A couple of the others followed in my sneezing effort. After that I shined my flashlight in the doorway. Empty…Or so I thought.



The cobwebs lined the doorway and almost blocked us from entering without knocking it down first. Inside the room itself was…well…not much. No wheelchairs, no portraits, no paintings, no nothing. The strange thing about this room that every room had as well was the wallpaper was ripped off the wall. No not chipped as you would expect the years to do. No, it was clearly ripped off the wall. The same was true for every wall in that hallway. 



We went room by room and every so often we would find a wheelchair or two, maybe some old antique vases, or an old portrait of someone. Except the last room on the hallway. In **Room 130**, like the first room we looked into, was completely empty. The wallpaper ripped off the walls. The difference in the two rooms were certain when I flashed my flashlight to the right side of the wall. In discolored, molded, and aged shade of red was written, or rather smeared, on the wall was: **Welcome to the last stop before hell**. 



It definitely creeped me out but we pushed on and now here we are. We are currently in the **North Wing Lobby** as labeled in that callus steel typed font. Everyone is getting antsy and…well…something strange happened not too long ago. I’m still processing it so it’s not too long but…



Seven minutes ago we heard something. I took out the EVP from my bag and turned it on. The static killed the silence set in by the atmosphere and different voices came on. 



Manly voice: Please, no more; no further



Feminine voice: Turn…a…r…o…d.



Deeper manly voice: The voices; they mis…d; don’t lis…n…to…t…m

Manly voice: Dea…will fol..w y…u.



It was striking to say the least. I’ve never had any voices come as clear as that at any other place I’ve been to. Some voices were clear, others were hidden behind the static. They seem to be trying to say something, but I can’t understand them myself but hopefully after going over these audio recordings more thoroughly, after we leave, it would be clear what their message would be. For now, I’m signing off and will record another log in an hour, so. *Click!*







Hey guys it’s me. As I was finishing this, as if on cue, I received another email. This time I put on notifications from this specific email address, so I wouldn't miss out on anything, and it just dinged on my computer. It’s the same email address as before so I know it’s him and I know you all are probably dying to hear more, but I’m scared to open it. Should I?
