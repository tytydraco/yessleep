I wasn’t the only one who returned from those woods.

I told the police what I saw. I did my best. But they called it trauma. They didn’t believe me then, and they definitely wouldn’t believe me now.

Still, someone should hear it. All of it.

Even when I was a kid, they said there were disappearances. Hundreds of years ago, in towns scattered like seeds across the map. Always kids. Always in summer.

My parents didn’t believe any of it, of course.

“Son, come now, don’t be one of *those* that believe in ghost stories,” my father would say, wine in hand.

“You could use some fresh air. And some socialization, while you’re at it,” my mother agreed, teeth purple, as she dumped more into her own glass. 

This is how I ended up alone in the forest, in the deep darkness of a humid summer night twenty years ago, with the only other kids my age that I could tolerate.

“Marco!”

It was my turn. I hated being “it”. Always the same simmering dread of stumbling into the unknown, those stories swimming in my head, knowing how the dark would smile as it felt my fear. 

“Polo! Come find me, airhead!” That was Sadie. She always tried to make her voice deeper, make it sound like Billy. It never worked. 

“Marco!” 

“Polo! Hah!” *That* was Billy. My best buddy. I knew he was doing a dumb little dance behind his tree right then. He always hid behind the biggest one he could find. 

“Marco!” 

The vulnerability of those nights never seemed to bother them like it did me. I’d get a shudder when one of us shrieked. The forest heard, I was sure of it. After all, we were using its home for our enjoyment, jumping on the furniture and roughing up the floors. I knew I wouldn't be able to handle it if it decided, one night, to come after us.

Despite my youthful cowardice, my eyes were still closed. I never broke the rules in our games. It would know if I was a cheat, too – I was absolutely certain of that. 

“Marco!” I said again, more timid this time. At some point in my path, the ground had turned into a graveyard of gnarled roots instead of a soft bed of leaves. Their laughs echoed far away. As I turned back, I tripped. My shoulder collided with a tree, and the bark caught my ankle. 

“Damn Marco…” I said to myself as my ass hit the ground, pain everywhere. I sucked at this game.

I sat there, eyes still closed, allowing the forest to play all of its sounds for me in the darkness, the creaking and the rustling and the whining. I just had my heavy breathing, humid sweat and fresh bruises. 

“po-lo.”

That’s what I heard in my left ear. Clear as day. I’m sure if Billy and Sadie were standing there watching me, they would’ve seen my eyes open wider than the moon as I jumped out of my skin. 

I couldn’t see properly yet, but I saw a dark shape there. She was crouched on the ground, right next to where I had sat. Dirty, so dirty I couldn’t see her face in the barely there moonlight. 

It was a little girl, but it wasn’t Sadie. This one had short hair, matted and twisted, like the roots under my feet. 

“h-i. was that ri-ght?”

I just stared back at her, mind blank from the shock. 

“i said it ri-ght?” she asked again. She spoke in a high-whisper that broke up in the middle of her words, like some kind of hiccup.

“Said what right?” I said, my voice not sounding like my own, like I was trying to speak in the middle of a nightmare. 

“po-lo. i heard. they were saying it. fri-ends? 

“Er…yeah, those other voices, they’re my friends. How long have you been out here? Do you live in our neighborhood?”

“i just wanted to pl-ay.” She still sat there, looking up at me, wide eyes peeking through the mud and soil that covered the entirety of her. One pupil was bright blue. The other was dark brown. And only one arm hung from her side. 

“Why are you so dirty?”

She looked puzzled at that and shuffled back behind the tree, her hand grabbing the bark and head peeking out. 

“what do you mean…i’m di-rty?” 

“Just…you’re…are your parents close by?”

She stood up, legs unfurling themselves into a length I did not expect, both skinnier than a gust of wind.

“i was hi-ding.” She made the slightest tilt of her head toward somewhere behind me, in the distance.

“Oh, you live in the Bishopsgate neighborhood? I know some kids from my school that live there.”

“no. i live he-re?” she said, uncertain, her foot stomping ever so softly to emphasize the point. Something about the gesture made me at ease. 

“Here as in…the forest? Can you show me?” 

She looked at me for a moment. Then shook her head no. 

“i don’t want my mother to fi-nd me. I ran aw-ay.”

I paused, then lowered my voice, in case anything was listening. “Did she do something to you?” 

Another look. She stepped behind the tree again. 

“she doesn’t want me to pl-ay. she wants me to learn to take on my ow-n. so she and i can ha-ve.”

“What does she want you to take?” 

“you,” she said. “you and fri-ends. bring you back, so I can have brothers and si-s.” She looked toward the direction I came from. A tear ran down her cheek, washing away some of the dirt in its wake. “but i can’t do i-t. you were having too much fun to st-op. i was watch-ing.”

A stick fell and cracked. Her head whipped around. She was missing a chunk of it, on the back, the same side of her missing arm. A dark hole of nothing was there instead. 

It gave me a moment to consider if I should run. It felt like I should, at first. I was the sole believer, after all. Fear threatened to shut me down right then and make me surrender, like I had always expected it would. 

But something about her made me stay. 

“Would she be mad if you didn’t come back?” I asked. 

“oh yes. you don’t want to make her ma-d. Then she uses her long arms to grab yo-u.” She stepped out from the tree. I felt cold as she came within a couple feet of me.

“i can’t see her face then. she doesn’t have one when she’s ma-d,” she said, in a murmur I could barely hear. 

“Come with me and my friends,” I said. It felt like we were running out of time. “We can help you. If they don’t believe you, I’ll help explain. ‘Cause I believe you.”

Her eyes didn’t blink as they looked right into mine. But I saw a flicker of movement in the dirt near her chin. It might’ve been the beginning of a smile. 

“wait here,” she finally said. “she’s sleeping. i’ll get my things and come ba-ck.”

“Okay. Wait, what’s your name?” I asked as she walked off into the darkness, her footsteps silent. She didn’t look back. 

I sat with my knees in my arms for hours, staring down the spot in the trees where she disappeared, hoping for her to come running through with her belongings, whatever they would be. The description of her mother repeated in my mind, scaring me more each time around, the long limbs and absence of a face taking shape in my head. I saw her body in the shadows that danced around the trees, taunting me. But I stayed with the fear and waited along with it. 

She never came back. 

After a few hours I got up, the bark in my ankle reminding me that the night was no dream. My limbs ached, but I didn’t feel tired. Just hollow. 

That’s when I heard the scream.

It wasn’t Sadie or Billy. It was mine. I didn’t realize it at first. Just felt the sound tear out of me as something moved behind the trees, fast and wrong.

I ran.

I didn’t think. I didn’t look. I just ran until the roots clawed at me, until my throat burned, until the shadows twisted sideways and something long and jointless was gaining ground.

Behind me, I could hear it. Not footsteps, not breathing. Just the sound of something being dragged through dirt and leaves. Something tall enough to move without breaking branches.

I glanced back once, and I wish I hadn’t.

It was faceless.

Not masked. Absent. A smooth plane where a face should be. Arms like branches stretching too far from a narrow frame.

It didn't run. It *reached*. And just before I crossed the edge of the trees, I felt something clamp around my ankle.

Cold. Dry.

It yanked. My knee hit the dirt hard, but my momentum carried me forward. I twisted around in time enough to see it recoil away from the flashing lights at the top of the hill.

And then it was gone.

The lights came from a row of police cars around Billy’s house. I half-collapsed onto the sidewalk in front of them, vaguely aware of a swarm of people yelling my name. Officers, reporters, neighbors I didn’t recognize. I don’t remember what they asked. I didn’t have answers, anyway.

Sadie sat on the curb nearby, wrapped in a blanket, her face pale and wet. She didn’t look at me. Just whispered something into her hands.

There were four bleeding slashes across my calf, spaced too far apart for human fingers. The paramedics didn't know what to say to that.

They never found Billy. Not really. Just a scrap of his shirt, tangled in the roots. 

The last time Sadie saw him, he was ducking behind a tree to scare me. He never came back out. She said she heard me screaming in the woods, but the sound disappeared, cut off as soon as it started. She wanted to follow but couldn’t move.

I still think of the po-lo girl when the humidity sets in deep in the summer, all these years later. The way she tried to smile and couldn't quite get there.

And I wonder if she got in trouble for letting me go. Or worse – if she finally did what she was made for.

I don’t know.

I just hope, wherever she is, she got to play.
