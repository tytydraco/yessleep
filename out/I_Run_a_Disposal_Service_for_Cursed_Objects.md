Flanked on either side by palace guards in their filigree blue uniforms, the painter looked austere in comparison. Together they lead him through a hallway as tall as it was wide with walls encumbered with paintings and tapestries, taxidermy and trinkets. It was an impressive showpiece of the queen’s power, of her success, and of her wealth.

When they arrived at the chamber where he was to be received, he was directed in by a page who slid open the heavy ornate doors with practiced difficulty. Inside was more art, instruments, and flowers across every span of his sight. It was an assault of colours, and sat amongst them was an aging woman on a delicately couch, sat sideways with her legs together, a look on her face that was serious and yet calm.

“Your majesty, the painter.” The page spoke, his eyes cast down to avoid her gaze. He bowed deeply, the painter joining him in the motion.

“Your majesty.” The painter repeated, as the page slid back out of the room. Behind him, the doors sealed with an echoing thump.

“Come.” She spoke after a moment, gently. He obeyed. Besides the jacquard couch upon which she sat was the artwork he had produced, displayed on an easel but yet covered by a silk cloth.

“Painter, I am to understand that your work has come to fruition.” Her voice was breathy and paced leisurely, carefully annunciating each syllable with calculated precision.   

“Yes, your majesty. I hope it will be to your satisfaction.”

“Very good. Then let us witness this painting, this work that truly portrays my beauty.”

The painter moved his hand to a corner of the silk on the back of the canvas and with a brisk tug, exposed the result of his efforts for the queen to witness. His pale eyes fixed helplessly on her reflection as he attempted to read her thoughts through the subtle shifts in her face. He watched as her eyes flicked up and down, left and right, drinking in the subtleties of his shadows, the boldness of colour that he’d used, the intricate foreshortening to produce a great depth to his work – he had been certain that she’d approve, and yet her face gave no likeness to his belief.

“Painter.” Her body and head remained still, but finally her eyes slid over to meet his.

“Yes, your majesty?”

“I requested of you to create a piece of work that portrayed my beauty in its truth. For this, I offered a vast wealth.”

“This is correct, your majesty.”

“… this is not my beauty. My form, my shape, yes – but I am no fool.” As she spoke, his world paled around him, backing off into a dreamlike haze as her face became the sole thing in focus. His heart beat faster, deeper, threatening to burst from his chest.

Her head raised slightly, her eyes gazing down on him in disappointment beneath furrowed brow.

“You will do it once more, and again, and again if needs be – but know this, painter – until you grant me what you have agreed to, no food shall pass thine lips.”

Panic set in. His hands began to shake and his mind raced.

“Your majesty, I can alter what you’d like me to change, but please, I require guidance on what you will find satisfactory!”

“Page.” She called, facing the door for a moment before casting her gaze on the frantic man before her.

She spoke to him no more after that. In his dank cell he toiled day after day, churning out masterpieces of all sizes, of differing styles in an attempt to please his liege but none would set him free. His body gradually wasted away to an emaciated pile of bones and dusty flesh, now drowned by his sullied attire that had once fit so well.

At the news of his death the queen herself came by to survey the scene, her nose turning up at the saccharine stench of what remained of his decaying flesh. He had left one last painting facing the wall, the brush still clutched between gaunt fingers spattered with colour. Eager to know if he finally had fulfilled her request, she carefully turned it around to find a painting that didn’t depict her at all.

It was instead, a dark image, different in style than the others he had produced. It was far rougher, produced hastily, frantically from dying hands. The painter had created a portrait of himself cast against a black background. His frail, skeletal figure was hunched over on his knees, the reddened naked figure of a flayed human torso before him. His fingers clutched around a chunk of flesh ripped straight from the body, holding it to his widened maw while scarlet blood dribbled across his chin and into his beard.

She looked on in horror, unable to take her gaze away from the painting. As horrifying as the scene was, there was something that unsettled her even more – about the painter’s face, mouth wide as he consumed human flesh, was a look of profound madness. His eyes shone brightly against the dark background, piercing the gaze of the viewer and going deeper, right down to the soul. In them, he poured the most detail and attention, and even though he could not truly portray her beauty, he had truly portrayed his desperation, his solitude, and his fear.

She would go on to become the first victim of the ‘portrait of a starving man’.

I checked the address to make sure I had the right place before I stepped out of my car into the orange glow of the sunrise. An impressive place it was, with black-coated timber contrasting against white wattle and daub walls on the upper levels which stat atop a rich, ornate brick base strewn with arches and decorative ridges that spanned its diameter. I knew my client was wealthy, but from their carefully curated gardens and fountains on the grounds they were more well off than I had assumed.

I climbed the steps to their front door to announce my arrival, but before I had chance the entry opened to reveal the bony frame of a middle-aged man with tufts of white hair sprouting from the sides of his head. He hadn’t had chance to get properly dressed, still clad in his pyjamas and a dark cashmere robe but ushered me in hastily.

“I’d ordinarily offer you a cup of tea or some breakfast, you’ll have to forgive me. Oh, and do ignore the mess – it’s been hard to get anything done in this state.”

He sounded concerned. In my line of work, that wasn’t uncommon. Normal people weren’t used to dealing with things outside of what they considered ordinary. What he had for me was a great find; something I’d heard about in my studies, but never thought I’d have the chance to see in person.

“I’m… actually quite excited to see it. I’m sorry I’m so early.” I chirped. Perhaps my excitement was showing through a little too much, given the grave circumstances.

“I’ve done as you advised. All the carbs and fats I can handle, but it doesn’t seem to be doing much.” It was never meant to. He wouldn’t put on any more weight, but at least it would buy him time while I drove the thousand-odd miles to get there.

“All that matters is I’m here now. It was quite the drive, though.”

He led me through his house towards the back into a smoking room. Tall bookshelves lined the walls, packed with rare and unusual tomes from every period. Some of the spines were battered and bruised, but every one of his collections was complete and arranged dutifully. Dark leather chairs with silver-studded arms claimed the centre of the room, and a tasselled lamp glowed in one corner with an orange aura.

It was dark, as cozy as it was intimidating. It had a presence of noxiously opulent masculinity, the kind of place bankers and businessmen would conduct shady deals behind closed doors.

“Quite a place you’ve got here.” I noted, empty of any real sentiment.

“Thank you. This room doesn’t see much use, but… well, there it is.” He motioned to the back of the room. Displayed in a lit alcove in the back was the painting I’d come all this way to see.

“And where did you say you got it?”

“A friend of mine bought it in an auction shortly before he died.” He began, hobbling his way slowly through the room. “His wife decided to give away some of his things, and … there was just something about the raw emotion it invokes.” His head shook as he spoke.

“And then you started losing weight yourself, starving like the man in the painting.”

“That’s right. I thought I was sick or – something, but nobody could find anything wrong with me.”

“And that’s exactly what happened to your friend, too.”

His expression darkened, like I’d uttered something I shouldn’t have. He didn’t say a word. I cast my gaze up to the painting, directly into those haunting eyes. Whoever the man in the painting was, his hunger still raged to the present day. His pain still seared through that stare, his suffering without cease.

“You were the first person to touch it after he died. The curse is yours.” I looked back to his gaunt face, his skin hanging from his cheekbones. “By willingly taking the painting, knowing the consequences, I accept the curse along with it.”

“Miss, I really hope you know what you’re doing.” There was a slight fear in his eyes diluted with the relief that he might make it out of this alive.

“Don’t worry – I’ve got worse in my vault already.” With that, I carefully removed the painting from the wall. “You’re free to carry on as you would normally.”

“Thank you miss, you’re an angel.”

I chuckled at his thanks. “No, sir. Far from it.”

-

With a lot less haste than I had left, I made my way back to my home in a disused church in the hills. It was out the way, should the worst happen, in a sparsely populated region nestled between farms and wilderness. Creaky floorboards signalled my arrival, and the setting sun cast colourful, glittering light through the tall stained glass windows.

Right there in the middle of the otherwise empty room was a large vault crafted from thick lead, rimmed with a band of silver around its middle. On the outside I had painstakingly painted a magic circle of protection around it aligned with the orientation of the church and the stars. Around that was a circle of salt – I wasn’t taking any chances.

Clutching the painting under my arm in its protective box, I took the key from around my neck and unlocked the vault. With a heave I swung the door open and peered inside to find a suitable place for it.





To the inside walls I had stuck pages from every holy book, hung talismans, harnessed crystals, and I’d have to repeat incantations and spray holy water every so often to keep things in check. Each object housed within my vault had its own history and its own curse to go along with it. There was a mirror that you couldn’t look away from, a book that induced madness, a cup that poisoned anyone that drank from it – all manner of objects from many different generations of human suffering.

Truth be told, I was starting to run out of room. I’d gotten very good at what had become my job and had gotten a bit of a name for myself within the community. Not that I was out for fame or fortune, but the occult had interested me since I was a little girl.

I pulled a few other paintings forwards and slid their new partner behind, standing back upright in full sight of one of my favourite finds, Pierce the puppet. He looked no different than when I found him, still with that frustrated anger fused to his porcelain face, contrasting the jovial clown doll he once was. Crude tufts of black string for hair protruded from a beaten yellow top hat, and his body was stuffed with straw upon which hung a musty almost fungal smell.

The spirit kept within him was laced with such vile anger that even here in my vault it remained not entirely neutralised.

“You know, I still feel kind of bad for you.” I mentioned to him with a slight shrug, checking the large bucket I placed beneath him. “Being stuck in here can’t be great.”  

He’d been rendered immobile by the wards in my vault but if I managed to piss him off, he had a habit of throwing up blood. At one point I tried keeping him in the bucket to prevent him from doing it in the first place, but I just ended up having to clean him too.

Outside of the vault he was a danger, but in here he had been reduced to a mere anecdote. I took pity on him.

“My offer still stands, you know.” I muttered to him, opening up a small wooden chest containing my most treasured find. Every time I came into the vault, I would look at it with a longing fondness. I peered down at the statue inside. It was a pair of hands, crafted from sunstone, grasping each other tightly as though holding something inside.

It wasn’t so much cursed as it was simply magical, more benign than malicious. Curiously, none of the protections I had in place had any effect on it whatsoever.

I closed the lid again and stepped outside of the vault, ready to close it up again.

“Let your spirit pass on and you’re free. It’s as easy as that. No more darkness. No more vault.” I said to the puppet. As I repeated my offer it gurgled, blood raising through its middle.

“Fine, fine – darkness, vault. Got it.”

I shut the door and walked away, thinking about the Pierce, the hands, and the odd connection between them.

It was a few years back now on a crisp October evening. Crunchy leaves scattered the graveyard outside my home and the nights had begun to draw in too early for my liking.

I was cataloguing the items in my vault when I received a heavy knock at my front door. On the other side was a woman in scrubs holding a wooden box with something heavy inside. Embroidered into the chest pocket were the words ‘Silent Arbor Palliative Care’ in a gold thread. She had black hair and unusual piercings, winged eyeliner and green eyes that stared right through me. There was something else to her, though, something I couldn’t quite put my finger on. It looked like she’d come right after working at the hospice, but that would’ve been quite the drive. I couldn’t quite tell if it was fatigue or defeat about her face, but she didn’t seem like she wanted to be here.

“Hello?” I questioned to the unexpected visitor.

“I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t like to show up unexpected, but sometimes I don’t have much of a choice.” She replied. Her voice was quite deep but had a smooth softness to it.

“Can I help you with something?”

“I hope so.” She held the box out my way. I took it with a slight caution, surprised at just how heavy it actually was. “I hear you deal with particular types of… objects, and I was hoping to take one out of circulation.”

I realised where she was going with this. Usually, I’d have to hunt them down myself, but to receive one so readily made my job all the easier.

“Would you like to come inside?” I asked her, wanting to enquire about whatever it was she had brought me. The focus of her eyes changed as she looked through me into the church before scanning upwards to the plain cedar cross that hung above the door.

“Actually… I’d better not.” She muttered.

I decided it best to not question her, instead opening the box to examine what I would be dealing with. A pair of hands, exquisitely crafted with a pink-orange semi-precious material – sunstone. I knew it as a protective material, used to clear negative energy and prevent psychic attacks. I didn’t sense anything obviously malicious about the statuette, but there was an unmistakable power to it. There was something about it hiding in plain sight.

I lifted the statue out of the box, rotating it from side to side while I examined it but it quickly began to warm itself against my fingers, as though the hands were made of flesh rather than stone. Slowly, steadily, the fingers began to part like a flower going into bloom, revealing what it had kept safe all this time.

It remained joined at the wrists, but something inside glimmered like northern lights for just a second with beautiful pale blues and reds. At the same time my vision pulsed and blurred, and I found myself unable to breathe as if I was suddenly in a vacuum. My eyes cast up to the woman before me as I struggled to catch my breath. The air felt as thick as molasses as I heaved my lungs, forcing air back into them and out again. I felt light, on the verge of collapsing, but steadily my breaths returned to me.

Her eyes immediately widened with surprise and her mouth hung slightly open. The astonishment quickly shifted into a smirk. She slowly let her head tilt backwards until she was facing upwards and released a deep sigh of pent-up frustration, finally released.

She laughed and laughed – I stood watching her, confused, still holding the hands in my own, still catching my breath, still light headed.

“I see, I see…” her face convulsed with the remnants of her bubbling laughter. “I waited so long, and… and all I had to do was let it go…” she shook her head and held her hands up in defeat. In her voice there was a tinge of something verging on madness.

“I have to go. There’s somebody I need to see immediately – but hold onto that statue, you’ll be paid well for it.” With that, she skipped back into her 1980s white Ford mustang and with screeching tyres, pulled off out of my driveway and into the night.

…She never did pay me. Well, not with money, anyway.

Time went on, as time often does. Memories of that strange woman faded from my mind but every time I entered my vault those hands caught my eye. I remained puzzled… perplexed with what they were supposed to be, what they were supposed to do. I could understand why she would give them to me if they had some terrible curse attached, or even something slightly unsettling – but they just sat there, doing nothing. She could have kept them on a shelf, and it wouldn’t have made any difference to her life. Why get rid of it?

I felt as though I was missing something. They opened up, something sparkled, and then they closed again. I lost my breath – it was a powerful magic, whatever it was, but its purpose eluded me.

Things carried on relatively normally until I received a call about a puppet – a clown, that had been given to a boy as a birthday present. It was his grandfather calling, recounting a sad tale of his grandson being murdered at a funhouse. He’d wound up lured by some older boys to break into an amusement park that had closed years before, only to be beaten and stabbed. They left him there, thinking nobody would find him.

He’d brought the puppet with him that night in his school bag, but there was no sign of it in the police reports. He was only eight when he died.

Sad, but ordinary enough. The part that piqued my interest about the case was that strange murders kept happening in that funhouse. It managed to become quite the local legend but was treated with skepticism as much as it was with fear.

The boys who had killed him were in police custody. Arrested, tried, and jailed. At first people thought it was a copycat since there were always the same amount of stab wounds, but no leads ever wound up linking to a suspect. The police boarded the place up and fixed the hole they’d entered through.

It didn’t stop kids from breaking in to test their bravery. It didn’t stop kids from dying because of it.

I knew what had to be done.

It was already dusk before I made my way there. The sun hung heavily against the darkening sky, casting the amusement park into shadow against a beautiful gradient. The warped steel of a collapsing Ferris wheel tangled into the shape of trees in the distance and proud peaks of tents and buildings scraped against the listless clouds. I stood outside the gates in an empty parking lot where grass and weeds reclaimed the land, bringing life back through the cracked tarmac.

Tall letters spanned in an arch over the ticket booths, their gates locked and chained. ‘Lunar Park’ it had been called. A wonderland of amusement for families that sprawled over miles with its own monorail to get around easier. It was cast along a hill and had been a favourite for years. It eventually grew dilapidated and its bigger rides closed, and after passing through buyer after buyer, it wound up in the hands of a private equity firm and its doors closed entirely.

I started by checking my bag. I had my torch, holy water, salt, rope, wire cutters – all my usual supplies. I’d heard that kids had gotten in through a gap in the fence near the back of the log flume, so I made my way around through a worn dirt path through the woodland that surrounded the park. Whoever had fixed up the fence hadn’t done a fantastic job, simply screwing down a piece of plywood over the gap the kids had made. 

Getting inside was easy, but getting around would be harder. When this place was alive there would be music blaring out from the speakers atop their poles, lights to guide the way along the winding paths, and crowds to follow from one place to the next. Now, though, all that remained was the gaunt quiet and hallowed darkness.

I came upon a crossroads marked with what was once a food stall that served overpriced slices of pizza and drinks that would have been mostly ice. There was a map on a signboard with a big red ‘you are here’ dot amidst the maze of pathways between points of interest. Mould had begun to grow beneath the plastic, covering up half of the map, while moisture blurred the dye together into an unintelligible mess.

I squinted through the darkness, positioning my light to avoid the glare as I tried to make sense of it all.

There was a sudden bang from within the food stall as something dropped to the floor, then a rattle from further around inside. My fear rose to a flicker of movement from the corner of my eye skipping through the gloom beyond the counter. My guard raised, and I sunk a pocket into my bag, curling my fingers around the wooden cross I’d stashed in there. I approached quietly and quickly swung my flashlight to where I’d heard the scampering.

A small masked face hissed at me, its eyes glowing green in the light of my torch. Tiny needle-like teeth bared at me menacingly, but the creature bounded around the room and left from the back door where it had entered.

It was just a raccoon. I heaved a deep breath and rolled my eyes, turning my attention back to the map until I found the funhouse. I walked along the eery, silent corpse of the fairground, fallen autumn leaves scattering around my feet along a gentle breeze. Signs hung broken, weeds and grasses grew wild, and paint chipped away from every surface leaving bare, rusty metal. The whole place was dead, decaying, and bit by bit returning to nature.

At last, I came upon it; a mighty space built into three levels that had clearly once been a colourful, joyous place. Outside the entrance was a fibreglass genie reaching down his arms over the double doors, peering inside as if to watch people enter. His expression was one of joy and excitement, but half of his head had been shattered in.

Across the genie’s arms somebody had spraypainted the words “Pay to enter – Pray to leave”. Given what had happened here, it seemed quite appropriate.

A cold wind picked up behind me and the tiny hairs across my body began to rise. The plywood boards the police had used to seal the entrance had already been smashed wide open. I took a deep breath, summoned my courage, and headed inside.

I was led up a set of stairs that creaked and groaned beneath my feet and suddenly met with a loud clack as one of the steps moved away from me, dropping under my foot to one side. It was on a hinge in the middle, so no matter what side I chose I’d be met with a surprise. After the next step I expected it to come, carefully moving the stair to its lower position before I applied my weight.

I was caught off-guard again by another step moving completely down instead of just left to right. Even though I was on my own, I felt I was being made a fool of.

Finally, with some difficulty, I made my way to the top to be met with a weathered cartoon figure with its face painted over with a skull. A warm welcome, clearly.

The stairway led to a circular room with yellow-grey glow in the dark paint spattered across the ceiling, made to look like stars. The phosphorus inside had long since gone untouched by the UV lights around the room, leaving the whole place dark. The floor was meant to spin around, but unpowered posed no threat. Before I crossed over, I found my mind wandering to the kid that died here. This was where he was found sprawled out across the disk, left to bleed out while looking up at a synthetic sky.

I stared at the centre of the disk as I crossed, picturing the poor boy screaming out, left alone and cold as the teens abandoned him here. Slowly decaying, rotting, returning to nature just as the park was around him. My lips curled into a frown at the thought.

Brrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnng.

Behind me, a fire alarm sounded and electrical pops crackled through the funhouse. Garbled fairground music began to play through weather-battered speakers, and in the distance lights cut through the darkness. More and more, the place began to illuminate, encroaching through the shadows until it reached the room I was in, and the ominous violet hue of the UV lights lit up.

I was met with a spattered galaxy of glowing milky blue speckles across the walls, across the disk, and I quickly realised with horror that it wasn’t the stars.

It was his blood, sprayed with luminol and left uncleaned, the final testament of what had happened here.

I was shaken by the immediacy of it all and started fumbling around in my bag. Salt? No, it wasn’t a demon, copper, silver, no… my fingers fumbled across the spray bottle filled with holy water, trembling across the trigger as I tried to pull it out.

My feet were taken from under me as the disk began spinning rapidly and I bashed my face directly onto the cold metal. I scrambled to my feet, only to be cast down again as the floor changed directions. A twisted laugher blast across the speakers in time with the music changing key. I wasn’t sure if it was my mark or just part of the experience, but I wasn’t going to hang around to find out.

I got to my knees and waited for the wheel to spin towards the exit, rolling my way out and catching my breath.

“Ugh, fuck this.” I scoffed, pressing onwards into a room with moving flooring, sliding backwards and forwards, then into a hallway with floor panels that would drop or raise when stepped on while jets of air burst out of the floor and walls as they activated. The loud woosh jolted me at first, but I quickly came to expect it. After pushing through soft bollards, I had to climb up to another level over stairs that constantly moved down like an escalator moving backwards.

This led to a cylindrical tunnel, painted with swirls and patterns, with different sections of it moving in alternating directions and at different speeds. To say it was supposed to be a funhouse, there was nothing fun about it. I still hadn’t seen the puppet I was here to find.

All around me strobe lights flashed and pulsed in various tones, showing different paintings across the wall as different colours illuminated it. It was clever design, but I wasn’t here for that. After I’d made my way through the tunnel I had to contend with a hallway of spinning fabric like a carwash – all the while on guard for an ambush. As I made it through to the other side the top of a slide was waiting for me.

A noose hung from its top, hovering over the hole that sparkled with the now-active twinkling lights. Somebody had spraypainted the words “six feet under” with an arrow leading down into the tunnel.

I didn’t have much choice. I pushed the noose to the side, and put my legs in. I didn’t dare to slide right down – I’d heard the stories of blades being fixed into place to shred people as they descended, or spikes at the other end to catch people unawares. Given the welcoming message somebody had tagged at the top, I didn’t want to take my chances.

I scooted my way down slowly, flashing lights leading the way down and around, and around, and around. It was free of any dangers, thankfully, and the bottom ended in a deep ball pit. I waded my way through, still on guard, and headed onwards into the hall of mirrors.

Strobe lights continued to pulse overhead, flashing light and darkness across the scene before me. Some of the mirrors had been broken, and somebody had sprayed arrows across the glass to conveniently lead the way through.

The music throbbed louder, and pressure plates activated more of the air jets that once again took me by surprise. I managed to hit a dead end, and turning around I realised I’d lost my way. Again, I hit a wall, turned to the right – and there I saw it. Sitting right there on the floor, that big grin across its painted face. It must have been around a foot tall, holding a knife in its hand about as big as the puppet was.

My fingers clasped closer around the bottle of holy water as I began my approach, slowly, calculating directions. I lost sight of it as its reflection passed a frame around one of the mirrors – I backed up to get a view on it again, but it had vanished.

I swung about, looking behind me to find nothing but my own reflection staring back at me ten times over. I felt cold. I swallowed deeply, attuning my hearing to listen to it scamper about, unsure if it even could. All I could do was move deeper.

I took a left, holding out my hand to feel for what was real and what was an illusion. All around me was glass again. I had to move back. I had to find it.

In the previous hallway I saw it again. This time I would be more careful. With cautious footsteps I stalked closer, keeping my eyes trained on the way the mirrors around it moved its reflection about.

The lights flickered off again for a moment as they strobed once more, but now it was gone again.

“Fuck.” I huffed under my breath, moving faster now as my heart beat with heavy thuds. Feeling around on the glass I turned another corner and saw an arrow sprayed in orange paint that I decided to follow. I ran, faster, turning corner after corner as the lights flashed and strobed. Another arrow, another turn. I followed them, sprinting past other pathways until I hit another dead end with a yellow smiley face painted on a broken mirror at the end. I was infuriated, scared shitless in this claustrophobic prison of glass.

I turned again and there it was, reflected in all the mirrors. I could see every angle of it, floating in place two feet off the floor, smiling at me.

The lights flashed like a thunderstorm and I raised my bottle.

There was a strange rippling in the mirrors as the reflections began to distort and warp like the surface of water on a pond – a distraction, and before I knew it the doll blasted through the air from every direction. I didn’t know where to point, but I began spraying wildly as fast as my finger could squeeze.

The music blared louder than before and I grew immediately horrified at the sensation of a burning, sharp pain in my shoulder as the knife entered me. Again, in my shoulder. I thrashed my hands to try to grab it, but grasped wildly at the air and at myself – again it struck. It was a violent, thrashing panic as I fought for my life, gasping for air as I fell to the ground, the bottle rolling away from me, out of reach.

It hovered above me for a moment, still smirking, nothing more than a blackened silhouette as the lights above strobed and flickered. I raised my arms defensively and muttered futile incantations as quickly as I could, expecting nothing but death.

I saw its blackened outline raise the knife again – not to strike, but in question. I glanced to it myself, tracking its motion, and saw what the doll saw in the flashing lights. There was no blood. Confused, I quickly patted my wounds to find them dry.

A sound of distant pattering out of pace with the music grew louder, quicker, and the confused doll turned in the air to face the other direction. I thought it could be my chance, but before I could raise myself another shadow blocked out the lights, their hand clasped around the doll. With a tinkling clatter, the knife dropped to the ground and the doll began to thrash wildly, kicking and throwing punches with its short arms. A longer arm came to reach its face with a swift backhand, and the doll fell limp.

I shuffled backwards against the glass with the smiley face, running my fingers against sharp fragments on the floor. The lights glinted again, illuminating a woman’s face with unusual piercings, and I realised I’d seen her deep green eyes before.

Still holding the doll outright her eyes slid down to me, her face stoic with a stern indifference. I said nothing, my jaw agape as I stared up at her.

“I think I owe you an explanation.”

We left that place together and through the inky night drove back to my church. The whole time I fingered at my wounds, still feeling the burning pain inside me, but seemingly unharmed. Questions bubbled to the forefront of my mind as I dissociated from the road ahead of me, and I arrived to find her white mustang in the driveway while she sat atop the steps with the lifeless puppet in one hand, a lit cigarette in the other.

The whole time I walked up, I couldn’t take my eyes off her.

“Would you … like to come inside?” I asked. She shook her head.

“I’d better not.” She took a long drag from her smoke and with a heaving sigh, she closed her eyes and lowered her head. I saw her body judder for a moment, nothing more than a shiver, and her head raised once more, her hair parting to reveal her face again. This time though, the green in her eyes was replaced with a similar glowing milky blue as the luminol.

“The origin of the ‘Trickster Hands’ baffles Death, as knowledgeable as she is. Centuries ago, a man defied Death by hiding his soul between the hands. For the first time, Death was unable to take someone’s soul. For the first time, Death was cheated, powerless. Death has tried to separate the hands ever since, without success. It seemed the trick to the hands was to simply… give up. Death has a lot of time on her hands – she doesn’t tend to give up easily. You saw their soul released. Death paid a visit to him and, for the first time, really enjoyed taking someone’s soul to the afterlife. However, the hands are now holding another soul. Your soul. Don’t think Death is angry with you. You were caught unknowingly in this. For that, Death apologizes. Until the day the hands decide to open again, know you are immortal.”

“That, uh …” I looked away, taking it all in. “That answers some of my questions.”

The light faded from her eyes again as they darkened into that forest green.

I cocked my head to one side. Before I had chance to open my mouth to speak, the puppet began to twitch and gurgle, a sound that would become all too familiar, as it spewed blood that spattered across the steps of this hallowed ground.
