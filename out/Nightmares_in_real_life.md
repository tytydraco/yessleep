Hi, first time posting. 

I've always had nightmares, not this severe but it's been getting worse. I've been getting complaints from my mom and boyfriend about my "screams" during the night. And it's affecting my actual life because I'm still scared when I'm awake. 

For example, I've dreamt last night that after my fiancé left, I choose to work in one of the living rooms but I noticed a shadow from the corner of my eye and panicked. When I've gone to check it in my dream, turns out it was my boyfriend but he wasn't my "actual" boyfriend. It looked similiar to him but I knew it wasn't him. He was acting strange and when I moved closer to him he smiled before he tried to strangle me. I kept fighting back, and he kept repeating that hurting him wouldn't matter because he'd keep coming back. I woke up sweaty and unable to go back to sleep. I've never had any nightmares involving my fiancé in the seven years I've known him. We have our fair share of disagreements and arguments but I've never actually gone to bed mad at him or with any arguments in mind. 

Today, after my fiancé left at night. I kept looking for my laptop and found it in that living room (we have three living rooms) my mom had moved it there from the other living room when she tidied up. I honestly was not thinking about that nightmare when I thought to myself that I might as well work in there since I was too lazy to go back to my bedroom (I live in a large house and it'd have taken me like two minutes) I start working, I only turn on one of the chandeliers and keep the rest off because I hate wasting electricity. But after a few minutes it feels like I'm being watched even when I know for a fact that everyone have gone to sleep, I just brush it off but my cat comes in and she keeps meowing at nothing in one of the corners in there. It honestly scared me because It felt very similar to my nightmare. I wasn't even able to leave using the main entrance because I'd have passed by that corner on my way out. So I just use the balcony on the opposite side that's also connected to the other living room and my bedroom.

My fiancé made fun of me when I mentioned this to him. I know we like to blame the paranormal when something unexplainable happens but I'm geninuely afraid. I don't watch horror movies. I don't enjoy reading horror stories. Even during one of the episodes when I "scream" according to my family at night, when I wake up most of the time I don't remember anything so it's not like I keep replaying it in my mind and scare myself even more. Last night the fact that I remembered was rare. I just wake up afraid not remembering anything for the most part. Because I moved in back with my mom at her new house, I've always lived on my own. So, me being alone at night have been the usual for the past five years. So, I know this isn't because I'm not used to staying up on my own. I was also never this scared back then. I know it isn't something related to the house because it's been empty for 10 years before my mom purchased it. It belonged to a single man that inherited it from his parents. It's in a very nice neighborhood and our aunt have always lived next door. 

I don't know if this is relevant (I'm Muslim) a while back I found a person who had an old witchcraft book for sale. I'm a skeptical person I really don't believe in witchcraft or ghosts. I believe in science but maybe I'm a scaredy cat. I read the book, it didn't make any sense and I threw it away and didn't think of it again. I don't know if this is related to that. 

My night terrors though have gone really bad for a month now. Any advice you guys? Is it nothing is it all in my head or what should I do to be able to sleep? Please genuine advice only.
