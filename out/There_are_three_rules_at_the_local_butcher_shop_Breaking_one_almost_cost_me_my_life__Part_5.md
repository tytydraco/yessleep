\*Brief mention of self-harm\*

The darkness curled around me. The buzzing, yellow lights above became my only respite from pure blackness. After George left, the cooler seemed to squeeze tighter, shrinking around me with every breath. The hum of the refrigeration unit grew louder, overtaking all other noise like the droning of insects feasting on rotten flesh. Every move I tried to make was met with pain. My wrists burned from struggling against the restraints, my skin now raw and slick with blood. My breath came in shallow gasps, the cold gnawing at my lungs. I could feel the foul stench of the cooler seeping into my bones, slowly becoming a part of me.

I knew I didn’t have much time. Maybe only minutes at best. My mind raced, chasing a finish line that was always just out of reach. My thoughts quickly drifted to John. I was the one who put him in the crosshairs of a psychopath. I couldn’t just lie there and die. I had to find a way to free myself and search for him.

I racked my brain, trying to devise a plan. Every time I thought of something, the sharp sting of the duct tape against my flesh brought me back down to earth. I could feel my energy draining by the second. I was exhausted and overwhelmed. I had almost given up when I heard a soft buzzing sound coming from within the room, barely audible amidst all the other sounds. It wasn’t the lights. This was different. It was more rhythmic and spread further apart.

Bzzzz…. Bzzzz…. Bzzzz….

The sound repeated every few seconds. I strained my ears to hear it over the maddeningly persistent drone of the lights. Listening intently, I was able to isolate it. It sounded like something vibrating against a hard surface. At that moment, I knew my mind was playing tricks on me. There was only one thing it could be… a cellphone. The thought of it confused me. There was no way in hell George would have left one in here unless it was all a part of his sick game.

I didn’t care at that point. I had to take the chance. It was my only option.

I scanned the entire room, searching for where he could’ve possibly hidden it. It sounded like it was coming from the opposite side of the room, inside one of the towering stacks of boxes. I twisted my body, using what little movement I could muster to worm my way toward it. Inch by painful inch, I pulled myself forward, desperately straining through the cold and fatigue. The tape cut deeper into my flesh, sending blood streaming down my arms and onto the floor. In that moment, I didn’t care how badly I was hurt or how cold I felt. I needed that phone.

Bzzzz…. Bzzzz…. Bzzzz…. it continued buzzing, mocking me with its persistence.

After an immense struggle, I was finally able to reach the stacks of boxes. I nudged one with my shoulder as hard as I could, sending it toppling over. It came crashing loudly to the floor, scattering its contents next to me. I used my elbows and knees to roll over onto my stomach, allowing me to observe the contents of the box. A few feet from where it had landed, several blood-stained clothing items lay strewn about, along with a person’s hand clutching a buzzing cellphone. It had been cleanly severed at the wrist, a dead giveaway of whose work it was.

Seeing a human hand didn’t faze me. I had seen worse in the last 48 hours. I didn’t even give it a second thought as I used all that I had left in my mind and body to get that phone. That’s all I really cared about until I got close enough to see the details of it. The more I looked at it, the more I recognized it.

My voice was caught in my throat. I wanted to scream, but my vocal cords had become so weak that I could barely make any sound at all. I turned my attention to the bloody clothing surrounding me, recognizing the pattern of the shirt and the rips in the blue jeans that John always wore. I dismissed it as a mere coincidence, not wanting to believe what I was seeing. I desperately tried to convince myself that it wasn’t real. I quickly found that not to be the case. The previous notion I’d had, that I was still a part of George’s twisted game, had come to fruition. The hand belonged to John. His class ring, silver with a cracked blue stone, was still on his finger. He never took that ring off.

Fear shot through my chest, forcing me to recoil backward. My mouth hung open, trembling from cold and disbelief. He did this to toy with me, knowing how to hurt me. Tears began to well in my eyes as the weight of this new reality settled across my mind. The phone continued vibrating in his palm, his fingers still clutching it as if it were still attached. The screen was smeared with blood, so thick that I couldn’t see the numbers underneath. Noticing this, my brain shook off the shock of the moment and threw me back into self-preservation mode. I had to keep moving. I had to get out of here.

As I tensed my muscles, preparing to move closer, a sharp pain shot through my stomach in defiance, pleading with me not to explore further. I closed my eyes and forced myself to slide closer. The screen went dark as the phone stopped buzzing. Silence filled the room, leaving my mind to battle with the thought of encroaching death once more. I desperately strained my muscles, pulling my body directly next to the hand. I didn’t want to believe it, and I couldn’t say for sure, but in my mind I knew John was dead. The reality quickly hit me that I would soon join him if I didn’t get his phone.

I pressed my face into the cold floor, nudging the phone with my nose. The screen lit up, revealing the slide lock. John’s blood had pooled and dried over it, obscuring it beneath. I tried desperately to angle my face in a way that my nose could swipe the screen and unlock it. I tried several times but had no success. The stickiness of the blood, coupled with my weak and demoralized state, made for an immense struggle. The constant fight smeared my blood across the floor, covering me in a mess of crimson. I didn’t realize how much I was bleeding until I began squirming across the floor in my attempts to unlock the phone.

Soon, it started buzzing again. I excitedly pushed my nose harder into the screen. I used a small glob of spit along with the energy I had left to scrape the blood away until I could finally see the caller’s name. It read:

‘Incoming Call – Mom’

“Aunt Carla!” I exclaimed in excitement.

I summoned everything I had left inside my body to crane my neck and jam my chin against the green answer icon. I bobbed my head up and down until I heard the buzzing stop. The call had connected. My head dropped down limply onto the phone, finally allowing me to rest for a moment.

Her voice crackled through the speaker, faint and confused.

“John? Hello?” She said in panic, “John, please answer! You’re scaring me!”

Physically and mentally drained, I barely mustered up enough energy to answer. I forced air into my throat, enough to scream, but what came out was barely a whisper.

“Aunt Carla... It’s Tom. I need help. Please... help me… hurry.”

I listened intently for a response, but I was met with silence from the other end. A moment or two passed when I heard her voice finally fill the speaker.

“Tom? Where’s John?” She asked with a panicked voice, “Is he with you? Is everything ok?”

I tried to explain and tell her where I was, but my body was failing me. My lungs were cold, and my mouth was too dry to utter any more words. The edges of my vision began to blur, tunneling into black. My head involuntarily fell limply against the cold floor in defeat. As the darkness crept closer, I accepted that I was going to die here. I knew what George was going to do to me. The same thing he had done to Amanda and countless others. I would soon be nothing but chopped-up pieces in a bag, half-buried in the woods. I didn’t really care at that point. I had given up. The last thing I heard before I let the blackness completely take over was Carla yelling my name.

“Tom! Are you ok? Where is John? Tom!”

A warm wave of comfort washed over my body as I let the void take me. I could hear Carla’s voice echoing into the cooler, getting softer and softer before finally fading into silence.

The darkness brought about a dream-like state in which everything I had been through in my life seemed to shoot across my mind like a movie. Snapshots of days past flew by in my memory as I slowly fell further into the abyss. I felt weightless, as if I were sinking into a pool, deeper and deeper as each memory shot across my vision. A black void encircled me, getting closer with each passing memory until it was within inches of my face, beckoning me downward. As it wrapped around me, pulling me down into the darkest recesses of itself, I gave myself to it. Long, black tendrils reached upward out of it and wrapped around my legs. The icy sting of its grasp quickly replaced the warmth I had felt prior. I sank slowly into it as the tendrils curled up my body, engulfing more of me with each squeeze. Like a snake devouring its prey, I was being consumed whole.

Suddenly, a bright light burst through the darkness, piercing my vision and illuminating everything around me. The light caused the void to fold inward, collapsing in on itself. The black tendrils quickly retreated, releasing my body from its frigid embrace. I started to rise out of its grasp and back upward toward the light. The stinging grip of the blackness gave way, the light taking its place. The warmth did not return. Instead, a brutal, biting cold ran across my body, chilling me to the bone. My hearing began to increase, starting as a low hum and transforming into something that sounded like a voice, quiet and distant. It got louder and louder until I could finally make out what it was saying. It was calling my name.

“Tom! Come on, Tom! Stay with us!” the voice boomed, echoing from the source of the light.

The lights strobed above me as I breached the surface. As I was pulled back into my cold, depressing consciousness, I was made aware of the gentle warmth of someone’s hand resting on my face. The bright light pulsated across my eyelids as I slowly regained my senses. As I opened my eyes, I could see a man in a powder blue shirt with a flashlight pointed directly at my face.

“There he is!” the man exclaimed, patting my chest. “Don’t worry, we are going to get you out of here.”

I turned my head to see that the cooler door had been forced open. Police and EMTs surrounded me, flanking me on all sides. I was covered in thermal blankets, shaking uncontrollably, barely alive. They started an IV and strapped an oxygen mask on my face before picking me up on a stretcher. As they began wheeling me out of the cooler, I turned my head, looking around the room in disbelief. As I looked around, I noticed that the room looked completely different. It was cleaner than I remembered. Looking over where I had been lying, I saw that John’s phone was still there. It was in the same spot, now encircled by streaks of blood from where my face had slid. As they pushed me out of the cooler and into the hall, I focused harder on it, noticing something strange. My blood was all around it, but his blood was nowhere to be seen. The messy mix of blood and spit that covered the screen had been cleaned off somehow. I stared at it for as long as I could until it left my line of sight. I couldn’t get through my delirious mind how that was possible. My face was cut to shit, bleeding heavily from trying to press my nose and chin into the phone’s screen, but you wouldn’t know it by looking at the spotless screen. As my body passed through the hallway, exhaustion overtook me, and I finally passed out.

I don’t remember much after that. My only thought is that Carla had tracked John’s phone and found me just in time. There was no sign of George when they arrived. He had been gone for God knows how long. I told the police about him. I told them what he had done to Amanda and John, but it all seemed to fall on deaf ears. They finally decided to investigate thanks to the added pressure from Carla to find her son.

Armed with the information I provided, they combed through the butcher shop. They’d done a cursory search when they first arrived, but this would hopefully be a deeper dive. I had hoped they would find John. I didn’t know if they would find him there. I just wanted them to find literally anything that connected George to all of this.

They searched for days but found nothing. A detective from the Redhill police department briefed me on their findings, admitting that not even the slightest thing was out of place. The place was spotless. It seemed as though, in the time that I had been unconscious in the cooler, he had pulled the greatest stage act in history, stripping all evidence from the scene. The boxes full of bloody clothes and body parts I had discovered were replaced with standard boxes of packaged meats. There wasn’t a single speck of blood on the floor other than what I had shed.

John’s hand was missing, of course. I figured George had probably kept it as a sick souvenir. The only remaining item was John’s phone. That question was answered for them when Carla explained that I was living with John at the time and had probably borrowed it. It was all bullshit. They chalked it all up to trauma and shock, reinforced by the doctor’s diagnosis. They said I had been hallucinating, brought on by oxygen deprivation and blood loss.

They couldn’t explain why my hands and feet were bound, eventually labeling it as just a strange attempt at suicide. I should’ve known from the very beginning that they weren’t going to believe me. In their minds, everything about my case had been answered. I had a quote-unquote episode and snuck into the butcher shop. From there, I had gotten stuck in cooler seven and then tried to commit suicide. That’s the lie that they came up with.

George played his game to perfection and then disappeared without a trace. I was no match for him. He’d killed countless people, including my cousin John, before trying to kill me, and nobody would give me the time of day to explain.

They continued investigating John’s disappearance once they had closed my case, eventually coming back to ask for my help in determining who might’ve done it when they ran out of leads. No matter how many times I tried to tell them, they would never believe that it was George.

“George is dead.” They said, “He’s been dead for a long time. There is truly no possibility it could have been him.”

They offered me psychiatric help, but I declined. I had no use for a talking head telling me things that I already knew and trying to throw pills at it to make it better. Fuck that. I chose to just go my own direction and try to heal in my own way.

That should’ve been the end of it. I should’ve moved on, gotten alternative help, built a new life. Carla continued to work with and without the police, trying desperately to find John. I knew she wouldn’t, but I couldn’t tell her that.

I couldn’t just stop there. The guilt and the overwhelming hatred I felt consumed me. I knew I would have to end that monster’s reign of terror one way or another. If not for just the satisfaction in knowing that I’d get revenge for what he did to me. I was the only person who knew who he truly was. I had seen the ugly truth behind the mask.

I started digging. I had to know more about him and his victims if I wanted to have a chance at this. Aside from Amanda and John, who else had been involved? I went back through records, archives, and forums until I found more stories about this type of thing. Several stories were eerily similar and seemed to fit the profile that I was looking for.

The pattern was unmistakable. There was a story about a teenager who went missing after working a single shift at the shop in 2003, along with a local homeless man who was last seen in 2011, walking behind Redhill Meats only four years after it had been abandoned.

Deeper into the forum, I found more. A delivery driver vanished mid-route in 2017, with his last known stop being Redhill Market, right across the street from the shop. This caused delivery drivers in the area to start carrying weapons on their routes. One of the saddest ones I saw was a chilling blog post from 2020, written by a guy named Dave who’d done a food documentary in the area. He was visiting local restaurants and had posted about a few before he just stopped posting altogether. Over a million followers and a high reputation on the internet all ripped away in the blink of an eye.

I started making a list. By my count, at least twelve people who had a connection to George in some way had vanished over the last twenty years, with God knows how many more that went undocumented. There were no bodies, no suspects, and no leads. It all made sense now. The man I had worked for used people to get what he wanted and then threw them away like trash once he was done. The worst part was that I had been complicit in that activity. I knew something felt off when I first started working there, but I was too scared and being paid too well to say anything.

My snooping around seemed to have got George’s attention. I started to have weird feelings when I was out in town, like someone was watching me. For a week after my research, I received several phone calls a day, all of which were filled with the buzz of fluorescent bulbs and slow, steady breathing in the background of the call. I just ignored my phone after that week.

I was trying to lay low, using the money I had saved to rent an apartment. It seems as though that didn’t work either. I received a strange package two weeks ago that validated everything for me and strengthened my pursuit even more. I came home to a plain brown box sitting on my porch. There was no return address or identifying markings. All it had was my address and a paid postage sticker for the shipment. I figured I must have ordered something and didn’t remember, but something felt off about it. I grabbed my pocketknife and opened it. Seeing the contents nearly made me puke immediately.

Inside was a strip of cured meat wrapped in vacuum-sealed plastic. Attached to it was a picture of me at my desk researching George’s victims on the computer. It had been taken from outside my apartment window. As I picked the picture up in my shaking hands, something fell from behind it and back into the box. I set the photo down on the table and looked back in to see John’s class ring lying on top of the meat. The same cracked blue stone stared back at me, still coated in dried blood. I closed the box and threw it across the room in anger, letting my emotions get the best of me.

That night, I packed all my things and moved out. I had to keep moving so as not to be an easy target. I had saved all the money I had made to afford a temporary place, and yet here I was moving again. As I was pulling the door of the apartment closed, something caught my eye. A slight glint drew my focus to the corner of the living room. John’s ring lay half-buried in the carpet, its cracked sapphire-blue stone gleaming in the moonlight. I hurried back inside to grab it. I held it in my palm, staring at my reflection in the silver band. A single tear landed in my hand as I wrapped my fingers around it. I thought about John and how desperately I wanted to get justice for what George had done to him. I stuffed the ring in my pocket and finally made my way out to my car to leave.

It’s been a couple of weeks since I left the apartment. I’ve stayed on the move, not staying more than a few days at any one place. I’ve only seen George once since then. It was a late Thursday night. I was staying at a cheap motel two towns over, trying to get away from the madness. I came out of the bathroom to get ready for bed when something familiar hit me. It felt like I was being watched again. All that time spent under George’s strict scrutiny had made me keenly aware when someone was watching me. I walked over to the window and peeled back the curtain with my finger to look out.

The parking lot was sparsely filled with cars. There was a small diner across the street that was open twenty-four seven, casting a bright yellow glow across the road and into the motel parking lot. I peered further down the road where, about a block away, a bus stop sat illuminated by a single streetlight. The light flickered, briefly lighting the area underneath the stop’s awning. As my eyes wandered into the darkness beneath it, I saw a man standing there. I squinted harder, struggling to make out details in the hazy dark.

As if by some paranormal timing, the streetlight pulsed brightly, allowing me to see the man’s features. He was unmistakably familiar. Before I knew it, I had locked eyes with the man who had caused me so much pain. George, the root of my torment, just stood there looking right at me.

He didn’t smile. He didn’t move. He just stared at me, like a predator eyeing its prey. Then, in a seemingly friendly motion, he raised a hand and moved it back and forth, like he was waving hello… or maybe goodbye. By the time I got my phone and looked back out the window, he was gone. Like a ghost, he had disappeared again.

That brings me to where I am now. I don’t know when he’s coming, but I know he will… He has to. I am the next one on his list and the only one who truly knows him. I was supposed to die in cooler number seven. I was supposed to be his next victim, and yet I’m still here. I have devoted my life to stopping him, no matter what it takes.

I haven’t slept for a couple of days. Every sound makes me jump. I’ve got weapons stashed all over this rental cabin, along with traps that I’ve rigged up by the doors and windows. I sleep in short bursts just in case I can’t wake up fast enough when he comes.

If this page goes dark, or if you never hear from me again, you’ll know why. If you’re reading this, do yourself a favor and stay the hell away from here. Don’t go looking for him, and don’t come looking for me. Don’t be a hero. He’s been doing this for a long time. He knows how to make people disappear without a trace.

I know he’s coming for me, but I have nothing left to lose. There’s no reason for anyone else to die. He wants me, and I swear to God, I’ll kill him if it’s the last thing I ever do.

My only request is that, if and when I die, somebody please show this to my aunt Carla. She deserves to know the truth about what happened to her son.

I can’t bear the thought of seeing her face, knowing that her only child is dead. I just don’t have the heart to do it.

But maybe, in these words, as fragile and faltering as they are, she’ll find what I never could. Hopefully, she finds the courage to forgive and the strength to carry on, even when the truth cuts deeper than the lie ever did.
