This all started back in my home town. Its one of those places where everyone knows each other and is in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by forest. No one ever goes into the forest because the last time someone did, they didn't come out. They sent a helicopter but they couldn't see anything. They sent drones and armed backup with cameras in there. They all disappeared without a trace. 

So this one night, me and my friend Sam were drinking and playing video games. Sam had just finished his 4th beer and said that we should go to the forest. Since I wasn't too drunk I said no because of what happened. And I don't know what made me, but I went. We crossed the road and started walking
At this point it was 3am and the street lights were off.

It was a bit scary and I don't know why I continued but I did. I kept on glancing over my shoulder because I swore I Heard footsteps but there was nothing. No cars, no people, no animals and no light. We were approaching the forest and I heard distant screams but brushed it off as a bird. Now that I think back, it wasn't a bird. It was load and angry. It sounded like a human but it sounded animal but it couldn't have been animal because it sounded too human.

We went in.

We walked 5 yards and we could no longer hear the road. We walked about a mile before we realised we were in a forest. At 3am. Alone. A forest where atleast 10 people disappeared 20 years ago, without a trace. We kept on walking for an hour before we stopped and fell asleep

When Sam and I woke up, my phone said 9am but the forest said otherwise. It was pitch black. We turned to walk back but we could not find the exit. I went to call someone to find us but then I realised that we had no signal. Then my phone died. We were stranded.

Sam and I kept walking, hoping to find a way out but we didn't. We then saw something tall and skinny with skin gauntly stretched over its thin white bones. It had a hunched back and cloudy grey eyes sunken into its head. It walked past and let out the same scream we heard at 3am. We legged it in the other direction until we came across a door. It was to an old and small cabin. We opened the door and were greeted with a dark room. We walked in and the door slammed closed. There was a hallway about 3 yards long. We walked to the end but then turned to leave.
That's when I realised the door was gone. What was in front of us was a corridor that looked never ending. It had many doors. We started walking up there and we heard screaming but there was no where to run. The doors disappeared as we touched them but one didn't. 

I went in and was greeted by a desk with chairs. They appeared to have people in them but we were hallucinating. 

The door started banging and then the creature from earlier got in. Is this what those people's fate was. If it was then it was going to be mine and Sam's too.

I tried to run but I was paralyzed.
I then blacked out
