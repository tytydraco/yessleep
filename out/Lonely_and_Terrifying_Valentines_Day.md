Valentine's Day used to be a challenging day for me as a long term single individual. Each year, it served as a stark reminder of my solitude.

However, this year, I opted for a new approach. I learned about a Valentine's Day gathering for singles occurring in my area and decided to check it out. 

Upon arriving at the event, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount  of attendees. A diverse group of singles all seeking romance. I engaged in conversations with a few individuals, but none of them piqued my interest.

As the night wore on, I began to feel more and more like an outsider. It seemed as though everyone was hitting it off, except for me. Then, I spotted her. She was standing alone in the corner, much like I was. I approached her and initiated a conversation.

We hit it off instantly, and before I knew it, the night had flown by. As the gathering drew to a close, we exchanged contact information and arranged to meet up for a second date."

Our second date was even better than the first. We went out to a nice restaurant and had a great time talking and laughing. She was smart, funny, and beautiful. I felt like I had finally found someone I could really connect with.

After dinner, we went back to her place. We talked some more, and then things started to get intimate. It was passionate and intense, and we were both really into it.

But then something strange happened. She started acting a little off, like she was someone else. She was saying things that didn't make sense, and her voice even sounded different.

I tried to shake it off and continue, but it just got weirder and weirder. Eventually, I realized that this wasn't the woman I had gone out with. It was like she had been possessed by something.

I tried to leave, but the door wouldn't open. It was like we were trapped in there together. She kept getting more and more aggressive, and I knew I had to do something.

I managed to break a window and climb out. As I ran away, I could hear her screaming behind me. I didn't look back until I was far enough away that I knew she couldn't follow me.

When I finally looked back, I saw her standing in the window, staring at me with eyes that weren't her own. I knew then that I had narrowly escaped a truly terrifying Valentine's Day.

The following days after my terrifying encounter with my possessed date, I couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that lingered within me. I tried to move on and forget about what happened, but I couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the real woman I had met.

Days turned into weeks, and I found myself feeling increasingly paranoid. I started noticing strange occurrences happening around me, things that couldn't be explained logically. Objects moved by themselves, doors would creak open and close on their own, and I would hear whispers and strange noises in the middle of the night.

One night, I was lying in bed, trying to fall asleep when I heard a faint tapping at my window. At first, I thought it was just a tree branch, but then it started getting louder and more persistent. I got up and cautiously approached the window, only to be greeted by a chilling sight. There, standing on my front lawn, was my possessed date. Her eyes were pitch-black, and she had a twisted smile on her face.

I quickly closed the curtains and retreated back to my bed, feeling more terrified than ever before. I couldn't explain what was happening to me, but I knew that I was in grave danger.

The next day, I decided to seek help from a spiritual medium. She performed a cleansing ritual on me, and I finally found some relief from the strange occurrences that had been happening around me. She explained that my date had been possessed by a powerful and malevolent spirit that was attracted to my loneliness and vulnerability.
