I used to think the worst thing about trying to get into law school was the competition. The sleepless nights. The LSAT prep books stacked like bricks on my desk. The quiet panic that everyone around me was smarter, faster, and already connected.

I was wrong.

The worst part was realizing that one professor had the power to decide who deserved to move on.

Professor James taught Constitutional Law—one of those classes everyone warned you about. He was brilliant, sharp, and terrifying in the way only someone completely confident in their authority can be. He never raised his voice. He never needed to. When he called on you, the room went silent, like a courtroom waiting for a verdict.

By the end of the semester, I was doing well. My grades were solid. My test scores were competitive. But it wasn’t enough.

A reference from Professor James would change everything.

He was the most respected faculty member on campus. Every student he endorsed was accepted into the best law schools in the country. He gave one reference per year.

I understood what that meant.

So, I did what I had to.

I visited his office hours constantly. I built rapport. And when I ran into classmates heading his way, I’d casually mention that he had left early.

It worked—until it didn’t.

One afternoon, I ran into a classmate named Robert outside his office. I told him Professor James had emailed me saying he wouldn’t be holding office hours.

Robert frowned.  
“That’s strange,” he said. “He specifically asked me to stop by.”

Before I could respond, I saw Professor James approaching. He tapped Robert on the shoulder and walked past me without a glance.

Robert smirked as he followed him.

My stomach dropped.

The next morning, after class ended, Professor James stopped beside my desk.

“We need to talk in my office,” he said. “Half an hour.”

The student next to me whispered congratulations. My heart sank.

When I entered his office, Professor James was already watching me. He pointed to the chair.

“I’ve been told you’ve been informing students about my office hours,” he said calmly.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”

He smiled.  
“Nothing to apologize for. I admire ambition.”

“You want my reference,” he continued. “And you know how selective it is.”

I nodded.

“I run an additional evaluation,” he said. “Very private.”

“How does it work?” I asked.

He leaned back in his chair.

“A game,” he said. “One designed to teach you what the law actually is.”

As I left, he added one final detail.

“Six A.M. tomorrow.”

I barely slept.

When I arrived at his office at 5:52 A.M., the door was already open. Professor James sat behind his desk, a yellow legal pad in front of him.

“Sit.”

Two minutes later, Robert walked in. He stopped when he saw me, then smiled tightly and took the seat across from mine.

The third student arrived last—a woman from our class I barely recognized. She avoided eye contact.

Professor James finally looked up.

“You are here because each of you has demonstrated a willingness to bend rules when it benefits you,” he said calmly. “Some of you did so knowingly. Others did so thinking no one was watching.”

His eyes flicked to me.

“This evaluation will consist of three rounds,” the professor continued. “Each round will test your understanding of the law—not as it is written, but as it is practiced.”

He slid three envelopes across the desk.

“Once opened, participation is mandatory.”

Robert laughed nervously.  
“This is a joke, right?”

Professor James smiled.  
“No. This is your future.”

He handed each of us a paper.

“You will not discuss this game. You will complete each task within twenty-four hours. Under no circumstances will police be involved.”

The woman signed without hesitation. Robert followed. I skimmed the page—an NDA, airtight and unforgiving—then signed.

 Professor James smiled, “Well done my pupils.” Robert scoffed out a nervous chuckle. The woman still sat still but I could see a smile creeping under her hair. Professor James then exclaimed, “The first round will begin right now best of luck. Also please abide by the rules I will be watching”. 

I opened my envelope on the walk home.

Round One: Intent.

The task was simple.

Vandalize a property.

That night, I pulled on an old Halloween mask and slipped into the quiet streets. I chose a small car wash on the edge of town. My hands shook as I sprayed two words across the wall.

*Mens Rea.*

I was turning to leave when a black SUV rounded the corner.

The window rolled down.

A camera flashed.

Once.

Twice.

Then the SUV drove away.

Ten minutes later, my phone buzzed.

Round One complete.

That was when I realized the game had already been watching me.

I headed to Professor James’ office early the next morning. He handed me the second envelope. “Excellent work. Best of luck on the next round.”

As I left, I saw Robert pacing at the end of the hall.  
“Don’t open it,” he warned. “The next round is just… fucked up.”  
I smirked, “Trying to limit competition, huh?”  
He shook his head, holding back tears.  
“No. This isn’t a game. It has real consequences.”  
I reassured him he didn’t have to participate.  
“You don’t understand,” he shouted. “Everything I worked for is gone. The professor controls admissions completely.”

I opened the second envelope as soon as I got home.

Round Two: Silence.  
Task: Steal Robert’s laptop and destroy all evidence of the game.

I waited outside his dorm until he stepped out, frantic and pacing. I smashed a window, slipped inside, and grabbed his laptop and the envelopes. I left quickly, careful not to be seen. Before I left, I saw the same black SUV driving off. 

Back home, I destroyed the laptop, burned the first envelope, and held the second in my hands. Curiosity and dread shot through me. Robert had been tasked with obstruction—planting evidence against another student to remove them from the competition.

Buzz.  
Round Two complete.

A text followed: Round Three will start in one week. 3:00 A.M. — address attached.

The next day at class, Robert was missing. The woman sat in the back, hands over her face. After the lecture, Professor James announced casually:  
“Class, one of your fellow students, Robert, is apparently missing. Let’s hope he’s just on a bender. If you have any information, refer it to the school or county police.”

My heart sank. I knew. The professor had made sure consequences were met.

I caught up to the woman afterward.  
“Hey, sorry, I never caught your name—”  
“Please leave me alone,” she interrupted. “We shouldn’t be talking. This isn’t a game anymore. Something bad happened last night, and we both know it.”

I stopped in my tracks as she walked off into the distance.

A week passed. Robert was never seen again.

The news called it a drug binge. An unstable student who trashed his dorm and vanished. His parents pleaded on television. The university released a statement expressing concern.

Professor James continued teaching as usual.

I tried to tell myself I wasn’t responsible. But ignorance didn’t change the truth. I had played the game. I had followed the rules.

Round Three came on a rainy night.

The address led me more than an hour off campus, down a winding dirt road swallowed by trees. When I arrived, a tall man in a black suit waited beside my car. His face was hidden behind a distorted rabbit mask.

“Follow me,” he said.

He led me into a barn illuminated from within. Rows of people sat in silence, all wearing animal masks. Their attention fixed on the center of the room.

Across from me stood the other student. Her head was down. Her hands trembled.

The doors slammed shut.

Professor James stepped forward, holding a microphone.

“Welcome,” he said warmly. “Tonight’s evaluation concludes. Round three, the final verdict”

A knife clattered onto the floor between us.

The crowd leaned forward.

The woman looked at me, tears streaking her face.  
“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

She lunged.

Everything after that felt unreal — noise, movement, shouting. I remember the guards blocking the exits. I remember the crowd cheering.

When it was over, she lay motionless on the ground.

No one screamed.

Professor James nodded, satisfied.

I received my acceptance letter a week later.

Top program. Full recommendation. No conditions.

I graduated at the top of my class. I work in criminal law now. I win cases. People trust me.

Last night, I received a text from an unknown number.

Final verdict delivered.  
Prepare your own evaluations.

I haven’t slept since.
