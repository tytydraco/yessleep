Deep off the coast, near old forest of pine, covered in a murky seawater and stuck in history.

There sits a liminality, a cavernous pit in the bellows of the earth, just off the coast of Île du Massacre. Until it moved to further off the coast of Mexico, right near the border split of Tamaulipas and Veracruz in Ciudad Madero.

The smell of petrol y mariscos forms a horrific image in the mind. It could appear ironic, as if some hellish olfactory deity had settled itself near or even on the coast.

In that great, musty chamber there is a massive pyramid glowing with an otherworldly light, settled all over its grades—scattered hieroglyphs that appear to shift and change when viewed from different angles.

The smell, while similar to that above in the human-polluted Syzygaia, was better here.

More that of a dank, ocean scent—the drippings of the oily mess left on the seaboard by Deepwater Horizon, that had been refined to a new sort of element, a liminal filtrate. Syzygaia mixed with, whatever this place is.

Atop that wretched pyramid, a great throne of jasper and sardius. Upon it a thing of great terror with little explanation, its form shifting and undulating slowly like the fog that rest over a lake.

In its lake-wispy depths—there is a sort of something, long and dark, and flashing like a lightning storm, an eel. It seems to have eaten it, rather recently—judging by the strange jet stream that is moving around in horrific knots.

This being was an Old God, a remnant of a forgotten age, its power still lingering in the depths of the earth.

It spoke in a voice like thunder, in a chorus of ten thousand Gregorian chants—promising power and knowledge to those who would seek it out or pay homage to its ancient might.

One dark and fetid night—a storm began forming off the coast.

A young Tampiqueñan man was walking down a dark street, near his grandmothers house in Las Flores.

He was grabbed and taken to a dark warehouse near el Faro de Playa Miramar, where he was horribly taken advantage of and terribly assaulted.

In his about dying breaths, through a large and rusted out hole in the tin—he swore he saw a vision of a strange orb… flying towards la boca del rio Panuco.

The, the orb flew right into his chest and he was transported into that deplorable cavern, with the dark, luminous pyramid and the strange old God.

The God, spoke in that boom, a scent of fish spread throughout the cavern.

He spoke in a sort of guttural language. With enunciations like that of the boys native language.

Drips of water all around, began to imitate the storm miles above, on Syzygaia.

The boy began to nod, understanding the horrible mutterings and utterances of his new GOD, thing.

GOD. GOD. GODEUS.

The young boy spoke out loud…

—GODEUS, KAOMORPHONEBUSULAE.

—M’RKATH’NEB.

The words were almost something, but the last were pronounced bizarrely.

(Merrkathawhknebb)

There was an almost pig like noise on the 'awhk'.

The boy reappeared in the warehouse, the men who assaulted staring in terror.

The young man has transformed in a daemoniac thing, with thousands of streams of black wispy air, like millions of strands of hairs. Tugging at the very ether of each of his abusers, and suddenly their forms ripping apart and fading into the air and into space…

There bodies own turned into a hellish and fiery aurora, as the young mans body slowly turned back into his corporeal form.

The young man sat with a smile upon that dark skinned and dark haired brow… he shook his head and laughed—then walked out the warehouse.

The night had all but started, and the rain began to pour in a torrential fury.

Unos mapachitos ran down the dark and soggy streets, directly towards the lighthouse.

One stopped and stared at the young man—the little raccoons beautiful, smoky, thieving eyes stared in wonder at the man thing…

The young man darted down the street with them, towards the lighthouse
