An arm wrapped around mine causing me to open my eyes and look over. April had taken hold so tightly it hurt but I didn’t mind. August carefully placed a hand on my back a soft expression on his face. 

“I know you’ll think of a way out of this. You always do.” He said without a hint of fear over our situation.  

I let out an annoyed sigh. It was kind of him to have some confidence in a friend however what did he expect me to do? Any magic I had access to was negated by the strange power Lock held. I was simply human against a God. 

Suddenly something clicked in my head.  

August noticed the expression on my face and knew the gears were working.  

That odd power blocked magic. And I was the only human here. 

Shu returned to normal when she needed to put forth any extra effort, meaning she was no longer slothful. 

 I needed to do a very simple thing to get us out of this mess. The hard part was reaching Lock before he killed Klaus. 

I gave April a quick hug silently promising her I would be back. Then, I took off running praying that those two would be fine.  

 The area was swarming with monsters. I was almost positive the Agent on the ground would keep the four Contract Workers safe.  I needed to do this alone and was a little bit glad the bird got her wing pinned down. If she tried to help me with this plan, she would have gotten killed.  

A creature got in my way; mouth filled with snapping teeth. A large strip of cloth came down slicing the head off so I could keep moving. I didn’t have time to stop and thank the Agent for taking down one obstacle in my path.  

I stopped at the first floating piece of rock and lifted my body onto it. Carefully, I jumped from platform-to-platform desperate to reach the top as quickly as possible. When another creature blocked the way, I was too far from the Agent for her to help. Its mouth came down on my right arm, ripping into the flesh. It hurt like hell, but I kept going. 

I took a huge gamble by testing out a little theory. My arm was ripped clean off, the pain almost stopped me in my tracks. Before I let the monster eat the arm, I gathered magic into it. A few seconds later the magic snapped, exploding outwards blasting apart the creature’s face causing it to fall to the ground. 

Soon the flesh around my wound started to reform. As I ran the limb healed back to normal. Ito’s threads were working overtime. I thought I sensed a small hint of anger from that connection. Ito was gone. He had turned into a bond that held this world together. And somehow his disapproval of my reckless actions remained. I would apologize to him later. 

I kept going. Ripping my fingernails from climbing up onto uneven surfaces.  Bones breaking from using too much magic to make myself jump higher. If something got in my way I wouldn’t slow down. If I was lucky, I could grab hold of the creature to see the spellwork keeping the body together. Snapping that would cause it to fall apart at least for a few minutes to buy some time. If I wasn’t so lucky a beast got a mouthful that exploded shortly after. 

I doubted I was immortal. If my head was cut off, or if my body was torn into too many pieces I wouldn’t be able to come back from that. And I could mentally only deal with so much damage in such a short amount of time. Still, I would gladly risk everything to save the people I cared about. Right now, I was the only person who could take down a God. 

I’d gotten so close. The larger platform where Klaus and Lock fought held a bundle of monsters at the end of it. My tactics I had been using wouldn’t be enough to deal with all of them. I needed to fall back to think of a better plan. Instead, I charged headfirst into countless claws and teeth. If Ito was here to see this, he would have greatly disapproved of this strategy. 

The world became dark. I had taken down a few monsters but was overrun with teeth. A set dug down deep into my neck and my mind shut off for a moment. All sights and sounds were cut off. I felt the teeth come out, but my brain was too fried to feel any pain. 

Not a single muscle would move. I was doomed to be stuck in their clutches then to be devoured? For a moment, I stopped caring. I wanted everything to stop. All the fear, all the pain and being worried about the world ending. Would dying here be all that bad? Alive or dead I would never see Ito again. Maybe, just maybe a stronger Agent would arrive in time to save everyone. I wasn’t needed to be the hero this time. 

An annoying pressure came at my back as if a hand had been firmly pressed on it trying to move me forward. Normally I would have been eaten in a blink of an eye, but I guess I tasted too bad for this monster to finish me off too quickly. The feeling of another hand pressed causing my feet to take a single step. A large mouth came down on my bad leg ripping at it. It hung on by a few threads of the bandages and my jeans. 

Suddenly I wasn’t in that moment. My brain went back to the last time I was with my old partner so vividly I thought I had been tossed back in time. 

My legs were in the mouth of a large sea creature we worked so hard to weaken. We hadn’t expected the job to be that dangerous. She was gravely injured and dangling off a cliff. By some miracle I grabbed her hand doing everything to pull her up while my bottom half was being gnawed on. She knew if I acted fast, I could save myself. Only myself. 

Because of grief I wasn’t able to even say her name for over two years. Now I was able to see her face so clearly. She wasn’t scared. Her partner was going to live and that was the best outcome a Contract Worker could hope for.  

“You got this.” 

Her hand slipped from mine her body falling into the water below.  

She was right. I lost my legs, but I was able to stay alive back then. Even after getting a new leg and having the other reattached I had been able to stay on my feet. Now shouldn’t be any different. 

With one more push I regained my motivation to keep moving. Ito's threads healed my body, but it also gave me a direct connection to the bond the fed this world with magic. In theory I had access to as much power as I wanted. Sometimes when it comes to magic if you have enough willpower, you can break the rules. I shouldn’t have been able to grab a sea of power and direct it into the creatures' bodies around mine, but somehow, I did. 

They were blasted away, some to such small pieces they weren’t able to reform. I wasn’t free of damage from such a bad idea. My body toss a few feet forward, rolling along the rough cement. My wounds smoldering as the threads worked overtime to repair flesh and thankfully some clothing.  

Klaus stopped his attacks, his body worn and nearly spent from efforts. I couldn’t see his expression through the smoke. I assume he would be shocked seeing a simple Contract Worker get up from nearly being blown to pieces.  

I was two steps away from Lock. I needed to make this next move count. 

“Impressive healing! But whatever manner of creature you are you can’t defeat a Go-” 

I lashed out swinging my left hand with all my strength directly into his smug jaw. A loud crack echoed through the air as everything else fell silent. His flowing glowing hair slightly fell and dimmed a shade. His expression froze in stupid confusion. 

He expected that I would use some magic to hit him.  

I didn’t. I used my normal human fist to land a punch. 

Only a second passed between us before I moved again. By the time he recovered enough to put up a wall of magic I tore through it and kept using my left hand to land blows on his face. I forced him to the ground, sitting on his chest not letting up on the punches. 

His two powers were in chaos. The odd one started fighting back against his normal magic. He couldn’t focus getting them in order and deal with getting punched in the face at the same time. Blood started to pour from his nose and my knuckles were torn from his teeth. I didn’t stop. I couldn’t risk it. 

Each time my fist came down his golden hair lost a little bit more shine. Finally, he raised his hands, bottom lip bloody and trembling. I stopped to catch my breath. 

“Who... What are you?” He said weakly barely hanging onto his last ounce of pride. 

After so long of being unable to speak the words finally came. 

“A Contract Worker.” I spoke, voice cracking form lack of use. 

His face dropped. I wasn’t a God. I wasn’t an Agent. I wasn’t some supernatural creature. I was just the hired help. And I had taken him down. 

It was enough to cause the sin power to break. Once that was gone, I didn’t have a lot to worry about. One last fist to his jaw knocked him out. 

The platforms instantly started to crumble. The fall would have killed me if it wasn’t for the other Agent with her cloth catching us. She carefully got me to the ground. My legs shook and body buzzed. 

The now beaten God was wrapped up with the white fabric so he could be taken somewhere else. I didn’t care about him anymore. I needed to know if everyone was alive. 

Klaus was alright enough to knock aside the larger rocks falling from the air. I rushed over to the pinned bird uselessly taking hold of what landed on her wing. 

Her partner watched me as if I was an alien. I didn’t blame her. They saw something that should not have been possible. With some help we got the wing free. It had been broken in so many different places. Wasting no time, I placed a hand on the wound then pulled some power through Ito’s connection to heal her.  

Healing by feeding a creature's body magic was tricky. You needed to know exactly how much to use or else you risked overloading their system. And healing hurt. If you did it too fast, it would mentally break them. She screeched but I was able to get the wing back into order. Her body changed into the tall human like girl I had met before. Slowly she flexed her arm amazed it had been fixed.  

“Thanks...?” She said slowly unable to understand how I was able to do what I did. 

“Does anyone else need help?” I asked looking over my shoulder. 

I felt like I was going to explode if I sat still for too long. My body needed to keep moving. I didn’t even notice how badly injured my left hand was. August walked over trying to get me to settle down. I reached for his head, and he pulled away promising his cut had already healed.  

We got into a brief argument. He thought I needed to sit down. I thought I needed to go find Jan to see if he needed any healing. 

The barrier had come down after Lock was knocked out. Agents started to swarm the area looking to help clean up the mess and for information over what had just happened. I was going to start helping them when I was lifted off the ground and placed on someone’s shoulder. 

No matter how much I struggled I wasn’t put back down. I didn’t like the odd expression on August’s face. April appeared a little disgusted over how easy I had been to kidnap. 

“I’m borrowing him for at least two days.” Klaus said with no room for disagreement. 

He spun on one foot, his other leg outstretched creating a perfect circle in the dirt. Most of the time creatures got to one location to another using magic doorway. It was possible to do the same using a circle, but such a spell required so much power and magic control not too many creatures could create them. 

We sank into the ground away from the scene and into a large room. Klaus tossed me onto a bed so big that by the time I crawled off he had crossed the room and locked the door. 

He knew my body was done before I did. The room spun and then darkness overtook everything. 

I had no idea how much time passed when I opened my eyes again. Someone had tucked me into bed and treated my left hand. Slowly I got up feeling sore. A new set of clothing sat on a bedside table along with a tray holding a still steaming bowl of broth.  

My stomach churned at the sight of food. Carefully I got out of the bed looking around trying to figure out where I was. If Klaus dragged me to his house, he was rich. The floor was made of polished marble. I felt bad sleeping on such nice sheets and staining them with my dirty clothing.  

Judging from the view outside the large ornate window I wasn’t in Kansas anymore. Hell, I wasn’t on the same planet. The sky was a deep purple with two moons hovering between some light clouds. Rich and from a nice fancy world not many people were aware of. Lucky bastard. 

The door was still locked. Looking for another way out I followed the sound of running water into a large bathroom with a steaming pool of water set into the floor. I might as well get cleaned up before changing out of my ripped and dirty clothing. 

Only after a bath, finishing the broth and getting into new clothing did the door to freedom unlock. Klaus hadn’t changed out of the clothing I last saw him in. It also looked like he had been pacing the entire time I slept. 

I moved to leave the room, but he stepped forward to block the doorway. His arm above my head on the frame. 

Something was... off about him. He looked slightly feral. His eyes still had the light white glow, and smoke slightly came from between his scars. 

“Did you sleep?” He asked trying to keep his cool. 

“Yes.” I nodded trying to think of a way to leave. 

“Wash up, eat?” He pressed. 

“Yes, I’m fine. I want to see if everyone else-” 

“They’re alright. No one died because of your crazy antics. Anyone that saw what happened would assume your suicidal. I should be sitting down with you to talk things over to see if you’re mentally sound. However, I am a monster. I think people tend to forget that.” 

I raised an eyebrow not understanding what he was getting at and why his expression was suddenly so intense. 

“I’m going to take advantage of you now. Tell me to stop and I will.” 

“Huh?” 

I wasn’t able to ask anything else. His next actions made it very, very clear about what his words meant. 

I had the power to tell him no. I knew I wasn’t in the right emotional mindset to stay there with him. And yet, I didn’t leave. I was too tired from the recent stress I fell back into the bad habit of being with the first person who asked.  

The details of our time together is private. I would rather die than let people know. But Agents saw the kidnapping and would be aware that something happened. I would need to avoid anyone from the Corporation until this blew over. 

Klaus was still asleep when I left his place. Making a doorway back to my apartment oddly became easy for me. Each day it felt like I was becoming less and less human by gaining better control of magic. Even though I was back in my world I didn’t feel like staying at home. I got redressed feeling uncomfortable in the borrowed expensive clothing then took a walk in the park. 

The weather had warmed up enough to be outside without a jacket. They replaced the bench I ripped out the night I met April. I didn’t know how much time passed by as I sat and thought over everything that happened recently. 

“Is this seat taken?” 

Glancing over I saw Klaus had followed me dressed far more causally than normal. I half expected him to treat our encounter like a one-night stand and ignore me for a while. I suppose he needed to go over what happened with Lock for a report. He sat down studying my face. 

“Are you alright?” He asked in a soft tone. 

“Fine.” I lied. 

Wrinkles at the corners of his eyes appeared from a smile. 

“You’ll let me do whatever I want to you for twelve and a half hour and yet you won’t talk about your feelings?” 

A wave of embarrassment came over my body. I hunched over hiding a red face in my hands. When I recovered enough, I lifted my eyes just enough to see him very pleased with himself. 

“I’m such a piece of shit...” I muttered mostly to myself. With a long sigh I leaned back against the bench eyes closed. “How long has Ito been gone for? A month? Two? And I’m already hooking up with someone else. He would find it disgusting.” 

I hated myself for how weak I acted however Klaus shook his head still smiling. 

“No, he would be fine with it.” He commented. 

“You say that like as if you know how he would feel.” I said sounding a bit annoyed. 

“I do. We talked about it.” 

My brain froze trying to process his words as he kept speaking. 

“He knew I was interested in you and begged to make the first move. I agreed in exchange that if anything happened to him, I could shoot my shot four days afterwards.” 

I sat stunned watching him pull a hand rolled cigarette from a silver case. 

“Four days? Not even a full week...?” I said barely able to get the words out. 

“We haggled.” Klaus calmly replied. 

A snort of laughter bubbled to my throat. I covered my mouth as tears came to my eyes. Those two were idiots. As much as I wanted to keep talking about how they came to such a deal I needed to get some questions answered. 

“What was that power that Lock had? Shu was overtaken by it too.” I said my voice as stern as I felt. “I deserve to know.” 

This was a well-kept Corporation secret. Lupa would throw a fit if he found out Klaus spilled the beans. He lit his cigarette letting the smoke drift for a moment. 

“There has been a lot of disagreements over if the Original Silver King created all the supernatural creatures and magic or if they were already here when he appeared.” Klaus started. 

I’ve heard a lot of different versions of stories about the Original King. It happened so long-ago that things were bound to change over time. I was a bit confused on why Klaus brought this up now. 

“Regardless of the answer, there are some worlds that exist that aren’t under his reign. And sometimes we come across those creatures. We call them Outsiders. For the most part they’re vague alien like lifeforms without a thought beyond devouring things around them. However, we have come across some that are very similar to supernatural creatures with their own set of powers like Dragons.” 

I nodded along. I’ve heard about this. Dragons originally didn’t follow any of the rules the Silver King put forth and they appeared to go beyond his orders. Because of this, supernatural creatures hated them. Over time they slowly bred with other creatures causing their magic to be tied with the Silver King. That didn’t stop most from not respecting Dragons. 

“The power you saw came from a creature that appeared in front of the Original Silver King. It challenged him to a fight.” 

My mouth fell slightly open. How stupid was that creature? The Original King went beyond a God in power. He could freely change things like the concept of time. A human mind couldn’t understand what the Original King was.  

“And it lasted for three seconds.” Klaus said pausing to inhale some smoke letting it drift from torn lips. “If that wasn’t impressive enough it didn’t die. Instead, it broke itself apart into countless pieces scattering through time and space. That’s what you saw Shu and Lock be infected with.” 

I frowned with my arms crossed. I hated the fact I was a little impressed by something that had caused so much pain and almost ended the world I cared for. Twice. 

“We’ve been calling it Infected by Sin. This power reacts to people in different ways. If humans can be infected by it, we haven't seen it happen yet. But if a supernatural creature is, it increases their magic by an immense amount. It also amplifies their worst personally trait. Most bad traits fall under the seven deadly sins, hence the naming.” Klaus shrugged. 

That made sense. Shu would be considered sloth from her lack of motivation. Lock had been Pride. From what I saw it was difficult for The Corporation to deal with people Infected by Sin. So, they had sealed away the creatures, or the pieces of power they came across. 

“It also drives them a little bit crazy. Shu is still recovering from what she tried to do. I doubt she’ll ever forgive herself for it...”  

He trailed off looking forward thinking about the poor girl. I wish I could tell her I wasn’t angry at her for what happened. I doubted she would believe me right now. She might just need some more time.  

“Only a handful of Agents in The Corporation are aware of all of this. I have first-hand experience. Back in the day I was also Infected. Can you guess what-” 

“Lust.” I cut in a deadpan voice not letting Klaus finish his thought. 

His smile didn’t fade. 

“Funny coming from Mr. Twelve and a half hours.” He grinned. 

I punched his arm unable to speak for a moment.  

“Speaking of punches, how were you able to take down Lock?” He asked. 

I glanced over trying to tell if he was joking or not. I assumed he already knew the answer. 

“I’m human.” I commented. 

For some reason, he looked like he didn’t understand that answer.  

“If the Sin power blocks Silver King magic, then I faked him out by making him think I was going to hit him with magic. I didn’t. My punch landed. Stronger creatures have magic in their cells and all that. I think I hit him harder because I don’t. The fact I was able to punch him took him down a peg and all that. Kinda hard to be prideful if a weak human makes your nose bleed. “ 

Klaus took a very long time thinking over my words. Finally, he looked over again as something clicked.  

“Sin power is broken when... they act against their sin...?” He spoke slowly as if this was new information. 

“You were infected by it! How do you not know what stopped it!” I half shouted at him almost embarrassed he hadn’t realized this sooner. 

“I had a lot going on back then!” He defended himself. 

“And you’ve never thought about it since? What have you been doing?” I huffed. 

“Pretty much everyone who let’s me.” 

I buried my face in my hands again. I can’t believe I let myself be with this dumbass. His expression showed off how funny he thought his answer was.  

“I’ll pass this along. For years we’ve been sealing this power away because we haven’t had a reliable way to remove it from people. About two or three years ago someone started leaking information about rituals to release those seals. They don’t have the full idea of how to do it. But if you use enough brute force someone is bound to get it right.” 

That was like thousands of people working away at the same password. At some point it’ll work. Unlike just getting locked out of an account, doing a ritual wrong could result in something getting through. No wonder why I’d dealt with so many jobs with openings to other worlds lately.  

“Do you have any idea who would be doing this?”  

Klaus shook his head. His smoke was finished, and he put the remains back into the silver case.  

“It might have been someone else Infected. Everyone inside The Corporation who knows about this has been vetted. I’m only telling you this because you helped us out with Lock. Your job is to not track down the person doing this. Your job is to live.” 

I wanted to argue but I was too tired. I just nodded as he stood up ready to leave. Before he did, he paused staring down trying to remember something. 

“Oh right, your leg isn’t looking so great. I noticed before but we were too busy to bring it up.” 

I kicked his shin then sighed. 

“I know. Dr. Fillow has been taking care of it. I’ll probably get it replaced soon.” I told him. 

“Soon? Why not now?” 

I gritted my teeth finally telling someone the reason why I’d been putting it off. 

“I’m scared.” I admitted. “The area could be beyond repair. There is a very high chance a new leg won’t stick. If I can’t get a fancy flesh one, then I’ll have to go with a prosthetic. If that happens then... I can’t do this job anymore.” 

I tried living a normal life for two years only to get dragged back into supernatural work. I wasn’t made for an office job or customer services. This current leg should almost be paid off. Even if I could afford a new one, I had no savings to fall back on. 

“Would quitting really be the end of the world?” He asked. 

Klaus didn’t want to see me in the field ant more than I needed to be. He’d watched so many people die on this job. I didn’t blame him for wanting one person to get away while they still could. 

“Maybe. I guess we’ll see.” I shrugged. 

Klaus nodded and stretched. He would offer any kind of help in a heartbeat, but he knew I wouldn’t accept it. He was lucky enough I sat down with him to talk as much as we had. 

“Do you want to come back to my place for a little while to take a break?” Klaus offered in a way that implied there would be no relaxing if I accepted. 

I shook my head my body suddenly feeling heavy. 

“No offense but just thinking about that is making me exhausted.”  

I doubted we would ever spend such personal time together again. I didn’t know who could handle a second night with him. He nodded hearing that kind of rejection before.  

“Take care of yourself.” The words were more of a threat than a suggestion. 

“I’ll try.” 

That was good enough for him. Klaus had a far more important job than me. He needed to get his uniform on and back into the office soon. It was a miracle he got away taking off as much time as he did. I let him head off knowing we would see each other again shortly. I dreaded to think of what kind of rumors were already spreading in the office about us. 

A cool breeze drifted through the park. I still had a few hours left of daylight. Since I didn’t feel like walking, I sat on the bench watching the wind blow the bare trees that hadn’t started blooming yet. Since I hadn’t charged my phone, it died hours ago. I knew there would be a flood of messages. I wasn’t mentally ready for them. So, I just sat avoiding my problems for a little bit longer.
