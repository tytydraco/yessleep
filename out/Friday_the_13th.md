[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c60nsc/friday_the_13th/)

It was October 12th, 1984.

My first day of high school was tomorrow. Our first day starts on a Friday, strange, but i brushed it off.

*It was late, I should go to bed.*

I yelled out to my mom,

'' Goodnight! ''

I woke up the next morning, Excited— I backed my bag, ready to head out the door.

I caught the bus. Many of the kids were talking about some strange new rule that had taken place.

Confused— I sat down next to my two friends.

I asked,

'' What's this new curfew rule that everyone and their mom is talking about? ''

They replied, in sort of a joke-like tone.

'' Oh! that! it's so the monsters don't eat us! ''

They giggled. They were clearly as confused as I was.

We rode the bus, and soon arrived at school. We all headed into our first class; I could hear kids whispering about it.

Throughout the day, I tried getting more information on it.

No luck.

Lunch soon rolled around, we ran to the cafeteria.

**''Attention all students.''** Came a male voice over the intercom. '**'As you've probably all heard by now, there's a new curfew rule taking place over the Parkville Area.''**

I gasped, ''I live there! '' I looked at my friends, then going back to pay attention to the announcement.

**''You must all be in your locked house's by 7:56pm.''** The Intercom voice said.

**'' If you are caught outside your house after that time you will not be saf-''** The intercom made a crackly noise, breaking up.

The cafeteria went silent, Confused.

I glanced around— The rest of the students were heading to the second class, like nothing had happened.

*It's like they were... Hypnotized...?*

A few hours later, School ended.

I walked home.

The streets were empty.

But i didn't feel alone.

All i could hear was the wind brushing against the trees, my own breath.

I rushed home, by now it was 6pm—Where'd all the time go?

I Walked upstairs, grabbing the homework from my bag, I sat down on my bed, grabbing a pen.

I must've been doing my homework for ages. It was 7:50pm now. six minutes away from the curfew.

My mom yelled out for dinner or so I thought. —before I could even go downstairs, there was a sound out my window, it sounded like footsteps...

Scared, I slowly crept up to my window, peering through the curtains.

I saw something, it looked like a person, although something was different—The being had no hair, A very pale complexion and was quite boney.

It started to turn its head slowly towards my home, I quickly ducked down before it could see me. I sat on the floor below the window,

Then I realized.

The being had no eyes. IT HAD NO EYES.

Just.. black...gaping... holes...

I slowly, but shakily peered out the window again, I locked eyes with the being as it had a terrifying grin on it's face. As it snapped its head towards me once more. I was terrified, I just stared—frozen in horror, I didn't dare make a sound.

I shakily closed my eyes, hoping it to be a dream... a nightmare at that..

I mustered the courage to open my eyes once more.

The being wasn't there.

I glance around—I heard my front door creak open.

*No.. no.. no*

*This can't be happening.*

I bolted into my closet, trying to hide, best I could.

I hid, for god knows how long. it felt like an eternity.

But then, I woke up.

*I must've fallen asleep.*

I slowly creaked open my closet door, stumbling out slowly.

I glanced at my window, it was morning, the sun was shining.

I thought to myself, *Huh, It was a dream? Wait.. But why was I in my closet...*

Trying not to think about the bizarre experience that had happened, I went downstairs.

I saw my mom, making pancakes like she normally does Every Saturday morning.

She turned to look at me with a warm smile on her face.

'' Good morning Sweetheart! how did you sleep? ''

'' I made pancakes! Your favorite, right? ''

*Maybe it was a dream.. She didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary had happened.*

I walked over to the kitchen where she was making pancakes, I bid her a good morning and sat down.

It was Saturday, I normally go outside and draw on Saturday mornings.

As I finished my pancakes, I walked outside where my drawing supplies were.

But as I looked up, to the forest that was behind my house...

I saw it.

I saw the same being that I saw the previous night.

I watched it, terrified, I saw it run into the forest even further with the same horrifying grin plastered on its face.

It didn't see me. Thank god.

Later in the day my mom was watching the local news channel—I glanced over, there was a missing person announcement. Curiously, I listened, sitting down on my couch. Someone, called Janet smith went missing, A seeming to be, young girl, like me.

I thought to myself.

*Has that got something to do with.. No.. no.. I'm overthinking this... people go missing all the time... right?*

A few moments later I heard a blood curdling scream, it sounded like it came from the forest.

I had to get to the bottom of this. I was too freaked out to even be scared anymore.

By now my mom was out doing the weekly food shopping, I was alone.

So I walked to the garage, grabbed a flashlight, and a small pocketknife.

I took a deep breath, walking out to the forest.

I stood there, at the forest's edge, I took a second deep breath, proceeding into the forest further.

The atmosphere was eerie.

***\*Whooooshh\****

sounded the wind.

It felt like i was in a horror movie.

I kept walking, looking for anything out of the ordinary.

***\*Crunch\****

I stepped on a twig.

*Phew..*

Everything went quiet.

But then i saw something.

It looked like a body of some sort.

I slowly stepped closer to it, being accompanied by the foul smell of blood.

It's limbs were gruesomely twisted, and bloodied.

My heart rate began to accelerate.

I shined my flashlight around the area, It looked like a murder scene.

I looked at the body again. It had blonde hair.. Just like the girl who went missing..

'' Oh god..''

I said, out loud.

The girl.. she.. she had no eyes either...

It looked like they were ripped out.. by something.. or someone...

Chills were sent down my spine.

I heard footsteps.

I slowly and quietly looked around,

then I saw it, the same unidentified being again.

Except.. something was different.

It now... had.. Eyes...

It must've.. used.. Janet's.. eyes.. They were brown eyes.. just like.. Janet's...

i trembled, as I shone the flashlight at its face, it cringed, as if the light was hurting it.

I knew it couldn't see. even with ''eyes''

I yelled to it.

'' You don't scare me! '' I said confidently, as my voice trembled.

It's head twisted to the side, to ''look at'' me.

The being said something in a raspy voice, i couldn't quite understand

It sounded like it said..

''They won't believe you.. ''

 All the hairs on the back of my neck stood up instantly as soon as I heard it speak.

My eyes widened as I bolted back, hoping not to get lost. I didn't dare look back.

I ran upstairs, my mom still wasn't home, god knows how long I was out there. I didn't want to know.

I jumped on my bed, pulling the covers over me.

I was terrified, I was just a high schooler after all.

But the being was right.. how could.. anyone believe me?..

I woke up the next morning, my mom was home by now, no clue when she got home.

I tried to act normal, I ate breakfast, brushed my teeth and got ready.

I rode my bike down to the police station, hoping to try to file a police report for the body I saw.

I described exactly what I saw, down to the very last detail, since the night of Friday the 13th.

They looked at me like I wasn't serious.

*Could they not see the horror on my face?*

Later in the day I got a knock at my door, it was the police.

They come to let me know how funny I was for making them search the forest for nothing.

They warned me that if I wasted police resources again that they'll be serious consequences.

My mom saw the whole interaction, she made me explain myself.

So, I did.

She said that I had a wild imagination, and that I should write a book, and warned me not to get the police involved in my silly little imaginative game. I pleaded with her, saying '' Please! You've got to believe me! ''

she smiled warmly. '' There, there, it's okay. ''

She seemed off, her eyes weren't even looking at me.

I further realized her eyes were brown.

My mom's eyes are blue.

Before I could let out a scream, I heard my door unlock.

My ''mom'' bolted off to the forest.

And my mom walked in the front door.

I looked at her eyes, her eyes were blue.

Then it hit me.

The being was trying to pretend to be my mom..

Oh my god.. What would of happened if.. no.. no... no..
