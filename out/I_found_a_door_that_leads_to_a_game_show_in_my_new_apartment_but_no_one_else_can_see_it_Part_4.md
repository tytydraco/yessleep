It came for me! The game came for me. I didn’t even play. I stayed away for days and successfully ignored the host’s siren call, but I was still punished. Ethan kept asking what was wrong and why I suddenly left his place. He found out I was sleeping in my car and started questioning me about it. I told him I had trouble sleeping in his house and my apartment has a pest problem. Another lie. Add it to the list. Of course, he saw right through it. He stopped me in the middle of the sidewalk, in the middle of the night, and demanded a real answer.



“You seriously would never believe me. It sounds insane. It IS insane!” I wrung my hands, anxiety bubbling over me like a bowling pot.



“Aaron, just spit it out. I promise, whatever it is, I’ll try my best to believe you.” He spoke in earnest, a tenderness in his eyes. Ethan was always a better brother than I could hope to be. I was more of a loner than him, more selfish, more willing to bend or break rules than he was.



“Fine.” I sighed. “Come with me.” I led him up to my apartment. As I approached my door I could hear the muffled sounds of game show music. I waited and turned back to face Ethan. “Do you hear that?”



“Yeah. Did you leave your T.V. on or something?” Ethan raised an eyebrow.



“Not at all.” I cautiously unlocked my front door and stepped inside the apartment with Ethan on my tail. The music stopped as soon as I crossed the threshold with him. There was nothing but darkness beneath the pantry door. I looked around like a dog on high alert for intruders. Every closet and door was the same. We were alone.



“Aaron, c’mon. What’s this about? Just tell me.” He prodded, but then picked something up off the ground. “Hey, what’s this?” Ethan held up a single, rectangular, card. It was sturdy like a business card and lined with gold paper. Printed on it was a single word in big, black letters: RISK.



“What the fuck? No, no, no, no!” I shouted and ripped the card out of his hand.



“What?! What does it mean? Where did it come from?” Ethan’s face flushed red as his demeanor became more parental.



“Okay, listen. Sit down. I’ll tell you everything.” I begged, gripping the card. I gestured toward the kitchen table, the hazel glow of the sink light being our only source of illumination in the witching hour. “There is a game show in my pantry.” I muttered and waited for his response.



“Okay, Aaron. Ha. Ha. Quick fucking with me.” He retorted sarcastically.



“No, seriously. Remember the candy bar and wine I told you about? It didn’t come from a friend. I won it from that sadistic game show! I should still have the bottle here.” I sped over to my trash can and fished out the half empty bottle. It was still here and the label was still legible. “See? It’s real.” I handed the bottle to Ethan for him to examine.



“This doesn’t prove anything. It’s just wine.” He shrugged.



“Except I looked up that brand and I can’t find it anywhere. It’s like it doesn’t exist!” With each doubting statement I combated, the more desperate I became. I opened Pandora's box and I needed Ethan to believe me. I needed my brother. “Not only that, but haven’t you noticed that I look visibly younger or that I’m just miraculously better from being poisoned?”



“Now that you mention it, you did bounce back pretty quickly, but you're also twenty-five so enjoy it while it lasts.” Ethan smirked, chalking it up to just youthful genes. He didn’t believe me. There was no way I could sell it to get him to buy in. It just meant that I was right back where I was before: alone.



“I’m not…AH!” I winced as pain erupted in my hand. Right in front of Ethan, the flesh on my palm split open and began spilling a copious amount of blood onto the white linoleum floor. My stomach groaned furiously and I rushed to the bathroom, lunging for the open toilet bowl. I spewed out mostly bile, my dinner, and what looked like specks of blood. I wretched and clutched onto the toilet basin with my bloody hand.



“Holy shit! Aaron! What’s happening?” Ethan rushed behind me into the bathroom, grabbing whatever medical supplies he could find in the cupboard. Once I was done puking, he turned me around, and quickly wrapped my hand in gauze. My head became weightless and my vision steadily grew hazy. That’s when the music started and shimmers of lights peaked from just around the corner. “We gotta get you to the hos…pit…al. Huh? What’s that?” Ethan stopped aiding me as his attention was drawn down the hall to the pantry.



“E-Ethan…Don’t!” I struggled to warn him as my world spun faster into an endless void until I was embraced by the forceful darkness of sleep.



I woke up to my T.V. playing on full volume and one of my neighbors pounding on an adjacent wall for me to turn it down. My vision was still foggy, but slowly cleared as I sluggishly stood on my feet. I clutched the sink with my good hand and pulled myself upright. I stumbled through the hallway, using the walls as supports. I managed to make my way over to the living room couch where I sat my full weight down in a painful, writhing pile. I plucked up the remote and lowered the volume to an acceptable level. The banging stopped and I set my attention to what was on the screen.



“No.” I croaked. It couldn’t be, but it was. Risk or Reward was on my television. The same, smiling host as the first time I visited stood at her podium. She still wore the name tag I saw her male persona wearing “Lugh.” I said through my teeth. That’s when the camera panned over to the audience. Shapeless, flesh colored faces filled the seats. It was like someone took a blurry photo of everyone, but that was their actual faces. Except, one face stood out to me. “Ethan!” I gasped, jumping off the couch. Panic and adrenaline surged through me like a tidal wave. Ethan sat among the other audience members smiling and cheering, but it seemed forced. I could see pain in his eyes and his cheeks looked wet. Was he crying? 



My mind raced faster than it had in months. Long gone were the days when my greatest worry was getting a report in on time or drawing the latest sales statistics or testing some new online algorithm for trends. Fuck all that. If I survive this…if WE survive this, I’m quitting. I'm done not living. I’m done not taking chances.



“Now! Wasn’t Aaron great folks?!” The host asked and the crowd cheered. “Don’t you think he should come back for double or nothing?!” Again, the crowd clapped. “Oh, but what’s that?! It seems Ethan, Aaron’s brother, is in the studio today! Perhaps he should try his hand at the game?” The crowd gasped, ‘oo’ed and ah’d’. “We will find out tonight on…RISK! OR! REWARD! And, as always, the choice is yours, Aaron!” The host looked directly at the camera, at me. Her face flickered and buzzed with the screen as she transformed into her counter persona. Both grinned at me, impossibly wide as the screen went dark. I was left in the glow of my apartment during midday with the Arizona heat, drawing out all my moisture.



“SHIT!” I screamed and kicked my coffee table with the bottom of my foot. I ignored the pain and wracked my brain for ideas. I needed to get cleaned up first. Address my wound and then come up with a plan. I have about twelve hours before the game show comes for me again and I don’t have a choice this time. Did I ever? I can’t ignore it and I have to get Ethan out of there.



As someone suggested in the comments, I’m going to try to take a camera with me. My phone should work and assuming at least one of us makes it out, we’ll hopefully have visual proof of Lugh and their sick game. Maybe I should take Gatsby with me again. He might be a good distraction. Let me know if anyone has any ideas! I’m open to suggestions! Otherwise…this might be my final entry. I hope it’s not.
