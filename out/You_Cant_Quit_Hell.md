I’m quitting my job today but it’s not the first time. Maybe this time it will stick. Maybe I’ll get some answers. What are the rules here?? All I know is I can’t quit or even begin to extricate myself from this limbo. Surely, I’m not making any sense. No sane person could understand these rants. 

It all started on the first day of the first month of this year. I’m not trying to be pedantic; those are just the facts. The first time I quit everything was normal. I put my laptop in a box and drove down to the flagship office in the city for my exit interview. But before I even got into the building I got a call from my Aunt Darla. She doesn’t usually ring me so I answered. At first what she was saying didn’t quite make sense but I put down the box on the hood of my car as I pieced it all together.
Evidently, Charlie had died. Charlie was my Aunt Darla’s dachshund. That tracked but what I learned next was a surprise. Towards the end Charlie’s medical bills started piling up and out of desperation and grief my Aunt turned to high stakes sport betting. She was in quite the hole and family is family just like tautologies are 
tautologies. We talked for hours but ultimately I put my computer back in the car and attempted to un-quit my job.

Over the next few months work plowed on. My aunt started feeling more secure and got some help with her finances. She’d even adopted a new dachshund puppy. 

It must have been good timing because work had become unbearable. I needed a break. Needed a change. I wrote out my resignation. I even discussed it with my direct manager. When all my ducks were in a line I hit send. Took a deep breath and literally took a welcome step back from my laptop. Maybe I’d mail my laptop this time. I was starting to think about celebrating when my phone rang. I didn’t recognize the number but the caller ID showed the name of my (now former) CEO Frank. 

Frank was overjoyed that he had caught me. See, a brand new opportunity had just opened up at the company where up until a minute ago, I no longer worked. I explained this to Frank but he said that I was the “only woman he’d trust” for the job. The only women? Like at this company or in general? I only had questions. The hours would be worse; travel would now be needed to conferences and social what-nots. The pay increase though was intimidating. And at heart it feels nice to be wanted. 

Cut to today. It’s been two months on the new project and I’ve finally hit my limit. I even googled the etymology of the phrase: end of the rope. Today is the day; no excuses and for a change, no notice. That’s right; I don’t even want to be eligible for rehire. I just quit. Hopefully the message gets through this time. 

Edit: while writing this I received a knock on the door. It was the police. They said that there is a problem with my birthright citizenship, which makes little sense since not one but both of my parents were born in this country. They said that since my father’s father was an immigrant on a work visa that his eligibility when he quit his job; back in 1925, was forcibly revoked and therefore my father was an illegal immigrant. I informed the officer that I’m gainfully employed but in the middle of quitting my job myself. His eyebrows perked up in amazement. He explained that I didn’t understand. The work permit was attached to our family’s case and if I liked I could take up the work permit in the stead of my long deceased grandfather. 

So it’s nearly August now and I still work for the same company. I’m not happy but I eat. I’m not sane anymore either. But when I keep my head down and work no one knocks on my door. Strangely the hardest part was being lied to. One thing keeps nagging at me: who was behind all of this? “Capitalism,” my boyfriend points out from the other room. Well if that is true why couldn’t I quit? Why can’t I just quit? And then the answer presented itself out of the ether. This could be hell. And you can’t quit hell. “Could be heaven too” the boyfriend likes to point out. “Or kind of a limbo. Or the like.”
