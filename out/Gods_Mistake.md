“Dear Public, we have notified higher-ups of the carnage outside, they’re not happy. We suggest staying indoors until further notice. Thank you.”  
That was the last message we all got, regarding safety.  
  
27th June 2046  
 For those who are not in the US, here’s the context, the US has cut out all signals from us to other countries and told us all that other-worldly beings have invaded and slaughtered the rest of the world. All American citizens have had to stay in bunker like buildings they’ve called, “Guidance”. The life here has been horrible, poor eating times, the beds are not properly made, and a rotten smell can be found near the employee sectors, where we’re obviously not aloud to go into to.   
But I’ve counted the days it’s been since we came in here, it’s been 572 days. I notified any employee I could find about it, but all they said was, “Don’t fret. You’re safe here.” Like hell we are. So, in a couple days, I’m going to sneak out of the sleeping quarters at night at figure out what the f\*ck is happening. I’m not staying here another day.  
  
1st July 2046  
I knew it. It’s a load of bullsh\*t. During the night, I got up and walked around a bit, the cameras in the building are poor due to us being underground. I continued walking until I smelt that smell again, y’know the rotten one I mentioned 4 days ago? I slowly creaked the door open, to see a lightly dimmed conference room, no-one in it, just an unfinished mug of coffee.   
I went in, the smell grew stronger, but couldn’t find the source. But then I saw the bathroom, already creaked open. I don’t know what I felt, but a wave of… fear, crept in. I slowly went to the door, peaked inside, and saw… a robot? Just standing in the shower? It looked like the Terminator but not active and didn’t look killer-like. I was confused, for sure, but then-……

“Dear Public, we have notified higher-ups of the carnage outside, they’re not happy. We suggest staying indoors until further notice. Thank you.”  
We all gathered around the message board, and that’s what it read. Obviously, we were all confused, we had all stayed inside for 577 days now. We all spread out again, going to do our own thing, but I just stared at the message, baffled. At some point though, I did end up walking away, and passed the employee sectors, still smelling awful, still wondering what it is though.   
I’ve noticed some of the people staying here have gone, maybe moved sleeping quarters? Everything about this whole “Guidance” thing is still off to me. I might explore after-dark, the smell from the employee sectors has been annoying me lately and has gotten stronger recently.  
  
3rd July 2046  
I woke up late again, like I said I would, and left to explore. I passed the employee sectors, the smell was way worse than yesterday, and the door was already creaked open a bit. I walked down the long hall, to the creaked open door, and peaked inside. There… standing in the middle of the room… was a tall, robot with blood dripping down it’s metal spine, staring at me.   
I fully opened the door, staring at it back, mortified. Its eyes looked like real human eyes, but I couldn’t properly tell due to the lighting. I stepped into the room, and when I did, without moving its mouth, said,  
“They’re lying to you. Your friends are gone. They’re like me now, slaves. Go back to bed, your fate will be more severe if they catch you again.”  
Again…?   
I looked down at my hands, there’s blood dripping down onto them, starting from my neck. I put my right hand onto my neck, then slowly pulled away… Showing a chip…?  
My vision starts to go blurry, and I trip a little. Looking up, I see more robots behind the one I already saw… all looking the same. With now a word, written in what looked to have been vomit, behind the robots, saying…  
“PUBLIC”  
I silently begged, I didn’t know what to, but I begged. Then in sync, all the robots said,  
“Don’t beg. We are mistakes. God’s mistakes, meant to serve and only serve. God wouldn’t forgive someone like us.”  
  
??? July 2046  
I passed out after that. And now I don’t know where I am, some science lab maybe? The only things I see are beakers, a lit candle on the side, and a Bible quote scribbled on the wall. It says…  
“Luke 13:3 – I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish.”
