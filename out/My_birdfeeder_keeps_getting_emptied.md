So a few months back my uncle died. Mum passed away a few years earlier and since the family was always small I was pretty much the only one left. So that left me the main inheritor. Mostly it was a few family keepsakes, a Quattro he got when he was 22 back in the ‘80s and kept like new, as well as a bit of money.

When I say that I don’t mean millions, but I also don’t mean like 20 bucks. It was what I’d call land but not life money. In that it would let you buy a place somewhere cheap but that’s about it. So I figured why not do that. After all, all I need to work is an internet connection and I can work contracts from home, especially if I don’t need to worry about rent. Not to mention can record some videos about homesteading since that’s big.

Finally I get the keys and moved into my own property. It’s actually kinda nice. The place had a bit of woodland around the house with a small building nearby that I think was a barn at some point (which was what actually sold me. Like, I could do an entire series on fixing up the barn, then get I don’t know ducks or something).

Anyway, so I figured may as well try to Disney up the place you know, make it so birds and critters are around. Best way to do that get a birdfeeder, right? Bird finds food, bird’ll come back for food later, I get videos of birds. Bird wins, I win, everybody gets what they want.

Go down to the local hardware store, since I’m now a local so I should support the local economy after all, and get a cute little birdhouse kit. And the next day go back to get some cement. Because as it turns out you stick it in the ground and it’s knocked over without something holding it up. Really should include that in the kit, all I’m saying.

Filled it up before bed with some bird-seed. The mix was for both native and song-birds so should have gotten some good looking birds coming for it. Then the next morning it was completely empty.

The problem was that it was empty before I got up, so no videos of the birds. Which I guessed made sense since birds would have eaten it around dawn when they got up.

I started working on fixing the barn. Which mainly consisted of watching videos on what to fix and how. But I set up my old doorbell camera facing the birdfeeder since it has a night vision and motion sensor so I’d be able to get footage of the birds.

That was two weeks and I’m really starting to regret doing it.

The next day I’m sitting there during lunch and figure may as well check the footage, since the feeder was empty again that morning.

Most of the motion notifications are nothing, a moth attracted to the sensor’s light, that kind of thing. But then I come to a big blip on the timeline. Makes sense that’s where the birds would be feeding.

The odd thing is that it was about two hours before dawn; but what do I know, maybe birds eat earlier.

I scrub along to it and start playing the feed. The feeder is there, all green looking in the night mode. Then from out of frame emerges a black shape, about the size of a human. It moves towards the feeder and stops. Like, it seemed like it almost walked past it, and only noticed it at the last minute. Then I recognised it. It was one of those old school plague-doctor costumes. Like the ones where the guy has a bird mask and a leather cloak.

He kinda just stood there for a minute and then stuck the beak in the bird seed. Then he just stood there for about 15 minutes. After that he reached up and scooped up the left over seeds and put them in his pockets and leaves. I say left over because there’s no way that was all that I put in there. But the weird thing was no birds came after that and before I appeared on the tape to check it.

That’s freaking weird right? So I googled it and found a tumblr post about someone doing that kind of thing to prank their neighbour. I’m new around, so figured must be someone having fun like that.

I guess I can see why it’s funny.

But the joke only has pay off if you know it worked. I checked where my neighbours lived on maps and fired up the Quattro and go to let either one know that I got the video and I get the reference, and they can stop.

Both ways are a bit further away. My property was kinda small, but the ones on either side had a lot of woodlands, so it took like half an hour to check in with both. 

One was this old dude, like four foot nothing. Said it wasn’t him, and I’d believe it. On the other side was a stay at home mum with two young kids, who said her husband was deployed. So it couldn’t be them either.

With them both ruled out that must mean it had to be someone else. So I watch the footage again, to see where the guy went. Because at least it might point in which direction they’re coming from. It wasn’t all that clear. He came from one direction and left in the other.

The next night I set up the camera at a different angle to see if I could see where he was coming from. Same thing, he walks from off screen, “eats” his fill and walks away. But I still couldn’t work out where he was coming from. Although this time it was at about 3AM.

For a few nights I change the angle to try and work it out. He always walks from around the house or barn, and them off in a different direction. Never the same direction, and always a different time between 1AM and 5AM. 

I even put up a sign next to the feeder with a glow-stick (which I’m now wondering how he could see where he was going in the dark?) saying that I get the joke, it’s funny. But that they were trespassing and I wanted to leave the bird-seed for the birds. But he just walked right past it and was back the next night.

At this point I was getting angry. So I spoke to the local cops, and they said that unless I could tell them which kid it was pulling a prank they couldn’t do anything and weren’t going to devote the manpower to “stake out a birdfeeder.”

So I overnighted a few trail-cams to work out where this guy was coming from or going. Maybe I get lucky and get the guy’s car. Set them up around the place further out, that way they can still see the house in the distance but have a better chance of seeing him put on the mask before his walk.

The next day none of them have him on it.

Feeder-cam shows him turn up for the seed, but none of the distant cameras show him.

Set them closer. But still the same thing.

Rinse and repeat until finally I’ve got the trail-cams pretty much circling the house and barn.

The ones that are aimed at the feeder show the still frames of him walking from around the corner of the house and walking past the barn; matching the video. But the ones around the sides don’t show him at all. Like AT ALL. They guy just appears and disappears coming around the corner.

That was last night.

I’ve got to figure that they’ve been able to work out where the trail cameras are and are coming from behind to turn them off, before circling back to turn them on later. That’s the only thing that makes sense, right? Trail cameras are designed for animals that don’t care about cameras, so it makes sense that a person could easily work out they’re there and avoid them.

Well, I’ve had enough of this shit. I’ve been hesitant to escalate things because who knows what that will do, but enough’s enough. Tonight I’m going to be waiting in the front-room waiting for the motion detector to go off.
