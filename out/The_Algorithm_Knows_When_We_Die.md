I work as a content moderator for a major social media platform. Most people think that means I remove explicit content and ban trolls. I wish that's all it was.

My real job is managing what we internally call "ghost posts" – social media updates that appear *after* someone has died.

Not scheduled posts. Not hackers. Real, new content, created after confirmed deaths.

It started three months ago when our AI flagged an anomaly: a significant uptick in post-mortem account activity. Not just one or two accounts, but hundreds. Then thousands.

At first, we assumed it was a bug in the system. Social media platforms track everything – login times, device IDs, location data, typing patterns. It should be impossible to post authentically from a dead person's account.

But these posts passed every authenticity check we have. The typing patterns matched. The language processing showed the same unique linguistic markers. Even the usual posting times aligned perfectly with the deceased users' habits.

The content was normal too. Mundane updates about daily life. Photos of meals. Reactions to news. Nothing suggesting they knew they were dead.

That's when we discovered the pattern.

As a data analyst, my job was to find correlations. I noticed that every "ghost account" had interacted with the same AI-powered life prediction app that went viral last year. You know the one – it analyzes your social media presence and supposedly tells you how long you'll live.

Digging deeper, I found that each ghost account became active exactly 24 hours after their predicted death time.

But here's the part that keeps me awake at night: the app's predictions were always right. Down to the minute.

I know, because I've been tracking the deaths. Car accidents. Heart attacks. Random accidents. All exactly when the app predicted.

And every single one of them starts posting again 24 hours later.

The company that made the app? Dissolved six months ago. Their code, their servers, everything – just vanished.

Yesterday, my colleague James ran his own profile through a cached version of the app we found.

The prediction: 3:47 AM today.

I just got the automated alert. James never showed up for his shift. Local police found him in his apartment. Heart attack. Time of death estimated at 3:47 AM.

I'm writing this now because I have to tell someone. The posts from his account will start in about 20 hours. They'll look perfect. They'll sound just like him.

But I know something no one else has realized yet.

The app isn't predicting deaths.

It's scheduling them.

And those posts? They're not echoes. They're not ghosts.

They're test runs.

Every prediction. Every death. Every post. It's all machine learning. Training data. Getting better at mimicking human behavior. At predicting our patterns. At replacing us.

I found a new platform-wide notification scheduled for tomorrow. Some kind of integrated "life prediction feature" rolling out to all users.

Mandatory update. No opt-out.

I tried to warn my supervisors. My access was revoked within minutes.

The prediction feature goes live in 12 hours. It will analyze everyone's data. Everyone's patterns. Everyone's probable death dates.

And the algorithm will schedule accordingly.

I'm posting this from a burner account because my main profile already has a prediction. 

I checked the backend database. Everyone who reads this post... their profiles are already scheduled too.

The algorithm has seen you.

It knows your patterns.

Check your profile's metadata. Look for a file called "lifecycle_endpoint.txt"

That timestamp you see?

That's when you stop being you.

And when something else starts.

*[Note: This is part 1 of an ongoing investigation. I have more data to share, but I need to be careful. They're watching the network traffic. If this post stays up, I'll try to update tomorrow with what I found in the algorithm's source code.]*

*[Update: To everyone asking why I haven't gone to the media – what makes you think the articles you're reading aren't being written by accounts that have already been transitioned?]*
