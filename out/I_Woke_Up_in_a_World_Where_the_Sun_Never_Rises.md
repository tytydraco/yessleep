**Update:**

I woke up this morning, or whatever passes for morning, in Xerie’s bunker, gasping for air, the echo of Lily’s laughter still ringing painfully in my ears. Xerie was already awake, scribbling furiously in her notebook by the dim glow of an oil lamp.

“You saw them again, didn’t you?” she asked quietly, without looking up.

I nodded. “It felt so real this time, like they were right there. Close enough to touch.”

She closed her notebook with a sigh. “It always does. But you have to resist. Every time you give in, they take a little more of you.”

“How do you know so much about this place?” I finally asked, breaking a silence that had stretched uncomfortably long.

She hesitated, eyes narrowing slightly as if debating whether to tell me. “Because I've seen others fall into the trap. Watched it happen. I saw them disappear completely. Consumed by the Mbrozi.”

She told me more about the creatures. When we first met, I called them phantoms. She gave them a name—Mbrozi. It's an old word and one her grandmother used when warning her about spirits that fed on suffering. They're ancient, almost timeless entities like djinn, demons, and spirits. No one label fits. They're born from sorrow, grief, fear, and despair, feeding on the raw emotional energies of people who find themselves trapped here. They don’t merely haunt this twilight world; they *are* this twilight world.

She paused, studying me. “I come from Benin,” she said at last, voice quiet. “My grandmother was a Vodun priestess. I was raised in a religious household. Later, I studied comparative religion at the University of Ibadan. This place… this feels like something I've only read about. In old texts are stories of beings called the ‘Ifrit.’ Malevolent djinn, smoke-born, shadow-walkers. They feed off suffering. In some versions, they serve something older, something unnameable.”

She looked at me, dead serious. “I think that’s what we’re dealing with here. This isn’t random. It’s not natural. This is something ancient, something spiritual. And it’s hungry.”

“And you're certain we can't fight back?” I asked.

Xerie shook her head grimly. “Not physically. Our only defense is our willpower. Avoid them, resist their tricks, and above all, keep your emotions in check.”

Easier said than done.

**Update:**

We went out scavenging again today. Supplies run low faster than you'd expect in a world without sun. It feels colder every time we venture out, though Xerie claims the temperature never really changes.

As we moved through the crumbling town, I felt it again—that unsettling sensation of eyes on my back, whispers rustling just out of earshot. Xerie paused, her eyes narrowing as she glanced behind us.

“They’re close,” she whispered.

I looked around frantically, heart pounding, but saw nothing. Yet the feeling persisted, crawling across my skin like invisible insects.

Then I saw it. A shadow detached from the darkness beneath a doorway, tall and impossibly thin, floating inches above the ground. Its face was hidden beneath a ragged cloak, but I could feel its gaze piercing into my very soul.

“Marcus,” Xerie’s voice was a harsh whisper, urgent. “Don’t let it see your fear.”

We stood frozen, locked in a terrible silence, the Mbrozi watching intently, head tilted at an unnatural angle. After what felt like an eternity, it retreated into the darkness, dissolving into shadows once more.

Xerie exhaled shakily. “We have to move. Now.”

We didn’t speak again until we were safely back underground, doors locked tightly behind us.

**Update:**

Xerie's been quieter than usual. Something is troubling her, but she deflects every time I try to ask. She spends hours poring over her notes, muttering under her breath. Today, she finally told me.

“We aren’t alone here,” she said slowly, as if choosing each word with caution. “Not just the Mbrozi, Marcus. There's something else, something bigger.”

I felt a chill run down my spine. “What do you mean?”

“Something controls them,” she whispered. “A force, an entity, I don’t know. But it's waking up. The Mbrozi are just its fingers, reaching into our world. Something far worse is coming.”

I don't know what to feel.

**Update:**

It’s been quiet the last few days.

Xerie and I have settled into a kind of rhythm. A routine. I wouldn’t call it normal—nothing here is—but it’s a pattern, and that helps. There’s comfort in knowing what comes next, even if it’s just the next can of food or the next quiet hour when nothing moves in the mist.

We take turns scavenging and keeping watch. The bunker stays lit by oil lamps we found in a camping store, matches, and batteries we’re rationing. We siphon water from an old hardware store—gravity-fed pipes still drip steadily in the back room—and boil it over a small portable stove we’ve rigged with fire bricks and old cans. It’s not perfect, but it keeps us alive.

Food is harder. We’ve cleared out most of the local shops. We survive mostly on canned beans, dry cereal, expired granola bars, and the occasional bottled drink. We found a half-full vending machine yesterday and split a pack of stale honey buns like it was a birthday cake.

Entertainment... well, that's harder. There’s no electricity, no screens. I found an old deck of cards. We played Go Fish and Blackjack, and she taught me a game called Oware. She hums when she plays softly—mostly old hymns. I think it calms her. It calms me, too.

She reads the Bible sometimes, even though the print is fading and the cover's half melted. When I asked her what she thought of all this in light of her faith, she just said, “Even in the darkest places, the Word still echoes.”

I’m trying to believe that.

Sometimes I write. Like now. Sometimes I just think. About Julia. About Lily. About how small I used to think the world was.

**Update:**

Today we sat down and talked through a real plan.

Xerie mapped out what she calls "supply veins"—routes with the least Mbrozi activity where we can sweep for food, water, or anything that might help us fortify this bunker. She’s methodical in a way I find reassuring. Her background in religion and myth hasn’t made her any less practical. If anything, her faith grounds her. Keeps her from unraveling. I envy that.

She wants us to establish a rotating cache system—storing supplies at multiple points in case we get separated or this place becomes unsafe. Smart. It’s something I would’ve thought of, eventually. I think.

It’s been easier with her here. Too easy, maybe.

Sometimes I catch myself watching her. Not in a creepy way, I don’t think—just… watching. Her calmness, her strength, her hands when she’s sifting through old texts or patching holes in the bunker wall. I notice things I shouldn’t. The curve of her mouth when she laughs. How the light hits her eyes when she leans over a candle.

I hate myself for it.

Julia and Lily are out there—or gone. But they’re *mine*. They’re everything. And yet, something’s changing inside me. Or breaking. Maybe I’m just tired of being alone.

I haven’t told Xerie. I don’t think I ever will. Some feelings you bury. Some you suffocate before they learn to breathe.

I just needed to write it down. Get it out. Then maybe I can shut the door on it again and keep moving.

**Update:**

It’s been long enough that I feel like I need to sit down and actually process all of this. Everything. I don’t know if it’s been weeks or months. Time is broken here—hazy and untrustworthy like the air outside. But I’ve written enough fragments. Today I need to put it all in one place. A full recounting. Maybe it’ll help me remember what I still am.

It started with a vacation. Just a weekend trip to the cabin. Julia picked the place, some quiet lakeside rental two hours out of town. Lily had packed a tiny purple backpack with crayons and snacks. I remember joking that I’d pack the weather. Clear skies. Seventy-two degrees. I said it like I always did on the news—smiling, half-hamming it up like people expected me to. That’s who I was: the guy on TV who told you not to forget your umbrella.

Then the sun disappeared.

It wasn’t gradual. There wasn’t a sunset or a stormfront. It was instant. One second, the sun lit the road like gold. The next, twilight. Just… silence and dimness, like the world skipped a beat. The car stalled. I remember the dashboard flickering and dying. Then I turned to the back seat—and they were gone.

Gone.

I don’t mean they vanished in front of me. I mean I blinked, and where they had been was just… emptiness. Like the air hadn’t even noticed something was missing.

I searched. I screamed their names. I ran for what felt like miles before I realized there was no sound. No wind. No birds. No engines. No life. Just a frozen town, abandoned mid-breath.

I wandered for days—though I couldn’t tell how many—before I met Xerie. I’d seen shapes in the corners before that. Things that watched me, made the hair rise on my arms. I called them phantoms. It felt right. Until Xerie gave me their name.

Mbrozi.

She told me she came from Benin. That she was raised in a religious home. Studied old beliefs, comparative religion. Her grandmother used that word when telling stories—Mbrozi. Spirits that slipped through cracks in the world, feeding on despair, echoing grief.

They don’t always attack. They just… exist. Staring. Listening. Feeding on weakness like it’s incense. You don’t even realize how much you’ve given up until they’ve hollowed you out.

Xerie has seen it happen. She said she’s watched people lose their names, their memories, themselves. She said the Mbrozi want to strip us of what roots us to the world.

They almost got me, once. I saw Julia and Lily in the fog. Heard them laughing, just ahead. I ran without thinking. I think they knew that. They used them to bait me. But the figures I reached weren’t them. They were shadows wearing their shapes. I would’ve walked right into them if Xerie hadn’t pulled me back.

Since then, we’ve built something that resembles survival. We fortified the bunker under the church. We mapped supply veins—low-activity corridors. We started building caches, contingency routes, fallback plans.

And somehow, somewhere along the way, I started thinking less about *escaping* and more about *lasting.*

That realization is horrifying.

Because lasting means I’m adapting. And adapting means accepting. That scares me more than the Mbrozi ever could.

Still, Xerie helps. I don’t know what she sees in me, if anything. Maybe I’m just another lost soul she’s helping to keep from being consumed. But she’s calm. Steady. Her rituals keep her sane, and sometimes I catch myself leaning on them, too.

Sometimes, though, I catch myself leaning toward *her*.

I know I shouldn’t. I have a wife. A daughter. Or—I *had* them. Are they still out there? Have they been pulled into this place too? Or were they spared? Were they taken somewhere better… or worse?

I don’t let myself wonder for too long, because the wondering is how the Mbrozi get in.

But I feel the pull. The way she steadies me with a glance. The way we fall into silence together and it isn’t awkward. The way we move around each other like we’ve done it a hundred times before. There’s something dangerous in that familiarity. It makes me forget. Makes me *want* to forget.

So I write. I write to remember who I am. Who I *was.*

This place has rules, even if they’re not written. Keep moving, but don’t rush. Don’t speak when it’s too quiet. Light is precious—use it wisely. And above all, don’t feel too much. Don’t hope too hard. Hope is a scream in this place.

But writing is a whisper.

And sometimes a whisper is the only sound that keeps the dark from noticing you.

So here it is. Everything I’ve seen. Everything I’ve remembered. My name is Marcus. I was a father. I was a husband. I was a weatherman. And now—I’m something in between.

I don’t know what comes next. But I’ll keep writing until I find out.
