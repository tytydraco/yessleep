My hands shake as I write these words, knowing they might be my last. The countdown to my death has begun - don't ask me how I know this. I just do.

It echoes in my skull louder with each passing moment, and when I close my eyes, I hear it clearly: tick, tick, tick. A clock measuring out my final moments. This nightmare has devoured my days, driving me to acts I never thought myself capable of. The ticking never stops. Even now, it reverberates through my bones, growing louder with each passing second.

I screamed at Mom yesterday. She just brought soup, asked about dinner. "Sweetheart, you're scaring me," she whispered. That look in her eyes... God, Mom, if you only knew how scared I am. Now I'm in my closet, shoved the dresser against the door. Stupid, right? trying to block death with this beaten-up dresser.

This all began a month ago, after the crash. They called it a miracle - the kind that makes you question if you're blessed or cursed. Five people died that day, their cars crumpled like paper around mine. Yet I stepped out without a scratch, not even a bruise. The paramedics kept checking and rechecking, convinced they'd missed something. That's when the ticking started. Just a whisper at first, so faint I thought it was tinnitus from the crash. The doctors agreed, said it was normal after trauma. Normal. There's nothing normal about hearing your own countdown.

In quiet moments, the ticking matches my heartbeat. At first, I thought it was just anxiety, stress from the accident making me hyper-aware of time passing. The doctors said it was expected - survivor's guilt, trauma response. Take these pills, they said. Get some rest. But pills might as well be candy, and silence has become my enemy.

I can't stand quiet places anymore. My desk at the office became unbearable - just me, my computer, and death's metronome. Now I work from crowded caf√©s, busy malls, anywhere with noise. My colleagues think I've become more sociable. The truth? I'm desperate for any sound that might drown out the ticking in my head. The baristas at Downtown Coffee know my order, always giving me the table near their loudest speaker. The music helps, sometimes. But even through the chaos of a hundred conversations, it's still there. Always there. Perfect clarity. Every step. Every breath. Every second.

That's when it began. Strange things. The birds came first, following my every move, staring with blank eyes that reflected only despair. Then came the accidents. Things that usually happen once in a while began happening daily. I slipped... why did I slip? The concrete was dry. Completely dry.

As if that wasn't enough, my eyes started failing me next. These eyes that never missed a thing, that could spot a quarter across the street - they began to betray me. Stepped right into traffic just days before. The car was right there. How did I not see it until I heard the horn?

My boss suggested vacation time. "You look exhausted," she said. If only that was all it was. The time off only made things worse - too much quiet, too much time to notice how the ticking grew louder with each hour that passes. Thoughts I'd been avoiding began surfacing, but I was afraid to reach the obvious conclusion. Perhaps I already knew the answer, just couldn't bear to face it.

My denial didn't last long. But come Tuesday, another crash - a truck this time, swerving into my lane on the highway. Metal screamed, glass shattered everywhere, cars spun and flipped like they weighed nothing. The world turned upside down. Asphalt rushing at my face. Should've died. The paramedics said as much, staring at me like they'd seen a ghost. Three totaled cars. Not a scratch on me. Again.

That night, the ticking changed. Faster, more urgent, like a stopwatch counting down instead of a clock keeping time. I paced my apartment, trying to understand why death's metronome had chosen me. Why it was getting louder. Why it seemed to speed up with each brush with death.

Then came the rat. Just a shadow darting across my kitchen floor, seeking the hole in my wall. I didn't mean to kick it - just a startled reflex. The wet crack against the wall made bile rise in my throat. But when I closed my eyes, something was different. The ticking... softened. Just slightly, but after weeks of listening to it day and night, I noticed.

I found myself staring at the tiny corpse, a horrible thought forming. Was it coincidence? The way the sound dipped after something died? No. No, that was crazy thinking. Had to be. But the thought lingered, whispering possibilities I didn't want to hear.

I've been in this closet for... I don't even know anymore. Time's wrong in here. Hours vanish. Nothing makes sense anymore. The ticking's so loud now I can barely think. Can barely write. My hand keeps shaking.

It stopped. One last time, I closed my eyes and found silence - sweet, terrible silence. This isn't a story anymore, just my last words before... God, I can feel it now. If I'm wrong about all this, I'll laugh it off tomorrow. But if I'm right... Mom, I'm so sorry for every-

**POLICE INCIDENT REPORT**

**CONFIDENTIAL**

**Report Number:** 2467

**Classification:** Death Investigation

**INITIAL FINDINGS**

* Body discovered in bedroom closet following neighbor complaints of odor

In fifteen years of service, I've never encountered a scene like this. Victim's injuries match those of a 60 mph head-on collision, yet occurred within a pristine 3x4 ft closet. Notebook recovered from scene shows increasingly erratic entries. Final entry terminates mid-sentence. Most disturbing: coroner's estimated time of death matches exactly with all stopped clocks in residence.

**RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

* Full forensics team deployment requested
* Comprehensive autopsy ordered
* Structural analysis of closet space
* Clock mechanism analysis
* Canvass for additional witnesses

**Case Status:** OPEN - Investigation continues
