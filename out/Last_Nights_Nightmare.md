It’s dark.

I’m not blind. I try to blink away the inky blackness, but I see nothing.

The air is still and damp. Thick and warm, like breath. It’s tinged with a faint sweetness like spoiled meat.

My hands and feet are tingling and the feeling begins to return to them. It’s hard to flex my fingers, but I put everything into stretching them out and then clenching my fists. As the sensation, like tiny fireworks, comes back, I realize that I’m standing on something soft and yielding.

It feels sort of like fine beach sand. The kind that you run through when you’re barefoot and it’s scorching the bottoms of your feet, but no matter how hard you try, you seem to be going slower than you should.

There’s a faint sound. A murmur, as if a crowd of people was some distance away whispering and muttering to themselves. I’m reminded of the sound of a theater in the moments before a play begins, when the audience is just about to get restless before the curtain rises.

The damp air clings to my lungs as I try to breathe, and I’m suddenly very aware of the fact that I am alone. In the dark. In a place that I do not belong.

Why am I here? I was walking to my car after work when … nothing. It’s blank. My wife probably has dinner ready. Or it’s already cold. With a rush, I realize that I don’t have my watch. I don’t have anything. I’m naked. The warm, thick air kept the familiar feeling of nakedness away from my perception, but now I’m keenly aware of it. Naked in the dark, standing on soft and yielding earth.

I’m beginning to see shapes in the darkness. It seems as though the blackness is not as absolute as I thought. Horizontal lines in the distance, and a curved ceiling high above me.

My breath catches in my throat as I register that I’m in an arena of some kind. Pictures of the coliseum flash through my brain, but this is nothing like what I remember of it. There’s ground, for one. And a ceiling. I’m inside something absolutely enormous.

Without warning, a harsh grating sound starts some distance behind me. I turn and can faintly make out what looks like a gigantic door opening in the wall. It’s not a way out. Even in the dim light as my eyes are adjusting, I can tell that the darkness is complete beyond that threshold. No exit that way.

The air grows even thicker as a sickly yellow spotlight pierces the darkness and blinds me. The light stabs my eyes with pain, and I shield them as best I can. The murmur grows louder and I hear a few chuckles. There’s a crowd here. An audience. Sparse laughter peppers the air as I rub my eyes and blink blindly into the spotlight. With a lurch, the spotlight swings up to the door and I can see it.

The clawed foot emerging from the depths of that portal looks like raw, scabbed meat caked with what looks like mud. It’s cracked like a dried riverbed and from this distance I honestly can’t tell if it’s broken skin or just dirt. With a dull thud, the foot lifts up and settles back down. I can tell from the way that its weight shifts that another foot is about to come out, and I’m paralyzed with anticipation as it does.

The … thing … looks as piteous as it does horrible. Ragged skin is stretched over what looks like an enormous human torso without arms or a head. In the middle of its … chest? head? … there’s a gaping hole with jagged and misshapen teeth. A sound like something gasping for air comes out of the hole and I hear the crowd around me begin to clap and cheer. The thing seems blind. At least, I can’t see any eyes. But it’s huge. At least as large as a two story building.

A second spotlight pops and sizzles and comes to life trained back on me. The crowd cheers and jeers and it’s impossible to tell who or what they’re cheering for. The thing on the doorway turns slowly toward me and I feel a sudden warm wetness on my leg. The crowd laughs, and I know then who they are rooting for.

With unexpected speed, the thing begins barreling toward me. It’s about 50 yards away at first, but the distance closes more quickly than I thought possible. I feel the adrenaline rush hit as my heart starts pounding and a faint buzzing starts in my ears. The dim light of the arena now gives me enough light to see that I am surrounded on all sides by what looks like a smooth white wall about 30 feet high. Dark brown is smeared all over the lower part and I imagine that it must be dried blood.

I’m not going to make it to dinner and my wife is going to be upset. It’s spaghetti night. We would eat, watch a movie or some TV, and then go to bed. The thought slashes through my mind. I can see her disappointment and worry as she wonders where I am and what I’m doing at work so late.

I run. I stumble. I scramble. The thing continues pounding toward me and its breath hits me, damp and rotten. The spotlights are trying to follow us, but they mostly swing wildly about the arena and I can briefly make out the opening that the thing came from. I don’t care. I run for it as the thing crashes over me. Without arms, it lunges and falls into me, knocking me forward and out of its reach. The crowd laughs as I fall down and then boos when it realizes that I’m still alive.

I’m covered and crusted in moist earth and I notice for the first time that it smells of sewage. The thing pushes itself awkwardly back up as I scramble toward the door. There’s probably no way out, but I’m not thinking about that. The blood rushes in my hears and my heart pounds and my feet push through the wet ground and I feel the mud and sewage squish through my toes and the thing behind me is getting closer and closer as I push and stain myself forward. Arms and legs pumping as I scramble ahead. With each lunge of the creature behind me, the dull roar of the crowd above me increases in intensity. It crescendos just as I reach the openi- *WHAM*.

Solid. It’s just painted black. A huge black square, painted on the white wall. My naked body sticks to it slightly, like when you sit on hot leather. It’s not paint. I smell the unmistakable metallic scent of blood. My brain barely has a moment to grasp this fact as I spin around and see the thing about ten feet away and coming fast. I leap to my left, trying desperately to get away.

A sharp and intense pain screams through my left leg as I jerk to a stop midair. My body hits the ground hard and knocks the air out of my lungs, but I don’t think about that. My scream rips through the air and I frantically dig and claw at the wet ground. Above me, the crowd laughs and cheers and claps as the thing leans forward, pushing my hips into the ground.

I can’t get away. The pain is beyond anything, but it’s already slipping away. I think about the ground and the stink and of spaghetti and I see my wife’s smile and frown as she wonders where I am and I feel the flesh rip and the bones break and I scream. Oh I scream. I scream until I can’t feel anything and the blackness begins to fill my vision again and the cheers and jeers of the crowd begin to fade and I can’t see or hear or feel or think.

It’s dark. And still. There’s a distant pressure on my lower back like someone is trying to pop my spine for me. Brilliant colors suddenly burst in my vision and I smell dinner and hear laughter and then I don’t hear anything.
