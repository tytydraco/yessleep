I moved into this apartment six months ago. It’s not much—small, cheap, and unremarkable—but it’s close to work, and the rent was dirt cheap. The landlord seemed eager to rent it out, practically throwing the keys at me.

“This place is old,” he said, avoiding my eyes. “If you hear anything strange, just… ignore it.” He paused, hesitating before adding, “And don’t touch the radiator.”

I thought he was joking. He wasn’t.

For months, everything was fine. The building creaked, the pipes rattled, and the radiator hissed in the winter. It had character. I figured the landlord was just being weird.

Then, last week, I dropped my phone. It slid under the radiator, just far enough that I had to kneel to reach it. That’s when I noticed the draft. Cold air seeped from the wall behind the radiator. Curious, I pulled it away from the wall.

Behind it was a door. Narrow and painted the same off-white as the wall, it had no handle, just a small keyhole. The edges were jagged, like someone had tried to seal it shut.

The landlord’s warning echoed in my head, but curiosity won. I grabbed a screwdriver and pried it open.

Behind the door was a staircase, steep and dark, leading down into the unknown.

The stairs were damp and uneven, each step groaning under my weight. The smell hit me halfway down—wet wood, mildew, and something metallic, like old blood. My phone’s flashlight barely cut through the shadows.

At the bottom was a room.

It wasn’t large, but the shadows clung to the corners, making it feel endless. In the center was a small table with an open book on top. The walls were covered with photographs, each pinned with rusted nails.

I stepped closer and felt my stomach drop.

The photographs were of me. Me at work. Me sitting on my couch. Me asleep in my bed. The angles were impossible, as if someone had been in the room with me, watching. One photograph showed me standing exactly where I was now, staring at the table.

My hands shook as I picked up the book. Inside was a list of names, written in faded black ink. Each name had a date and a word next to it: STAY or LOST. My name was at the bottom. Next to it, the word was PENDING.

A loud creak echoed behind me, and I ran.

That night, I convinced myself it was a prank. Maybe the last tenant had some sick sense of humor. Maybe the photos weren’t real. But when I went back to check, the door was gone.

I shoved the radiator back into place and tried to forget. I didn’t tell anyone. What would I say?

The tapping started that night.

It was faint at first, just a soft knock-knock-knock coming from the radiator. I ignored it, telling myself it was the pipes. But it grew louder, more deliberate, like fingernails raking against wood. I pressed my ear to the wall, and the tapping stopped.

Then I heard the whispers.

They were faint, barely audible at first. But as the hours passed, they grew louder. My name, repeated over and over, like a chant. “Come back,” they whispered. “Come back.”

The next morning, I went to the landlord’s office. He looked up, startled, when I mentioned the door.

“You opened it,” he said, his face pale.

“What’s down there?” I demanded. “What’s in the room?”

He didn’t answer. Instead, he reached into his desk and pulled out a photograph. It was black and white, faded with age. The room in the photograph was the same one I’d seen, but the figure standing in the center wasn’t me. It was a man, tall and blurred, like the camera couldn’t fully capture him. His face was distorted, his smile too wide.

“This building has a history,” the landlord said, his voice low. “Tenants who find the room either leave in the middle of the night and never come back, or…” He trailed off, his hands trembling.

“Or what?” I asked.

He didn’t meet my eyes. “Or they stay.”

That night, I woke up to footsteps. Slow, deliberate, moving across my bedroom floor. My chest tightened as the radiator began to rattle. The screws holding it in place vibrated loose, and the radiator slid forward, revealing the door.

The door opened on its own, the staircase yawning beneath me. My name echoed from the darkness below, dozens of voices whispering in unison.

My breath hitched as I glanced at the mirror across the room. My reflection wasn’t lying in bed anymore. It was standing at the foot of the staircase, staring back at me.

It smiled.

This morning, I found a new photograph slipped under my door. It showed me sitting at the table in the hidden room, the book open in front of me. But the figure standing behind me wasn’t blurred anymore. It was my reflection, its grin stretched unnaturally wide, its eyes black.

The whispers haven’t stopped. The reflection in the mirror is closer every time I look.

I don’t think I can fight it anymore.

I think I already stayed.
