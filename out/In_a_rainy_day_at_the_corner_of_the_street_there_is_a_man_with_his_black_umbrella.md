Whenever it rains, I always see him.

He wears a black suit, with the same color umbrella in his hand, as if he is desperately waiting for someone. And just standing there, doing nothing.

I know he is NOT a human. Nobody has much time to stupidly stand every time it rains at the corner of the street. Also, since no one notices him make me sure about that. Well, of course, I don’t want to be involved with him – ghost and human are in the separate world – if I haven’t seen him for two or three years until now.

I was annoyed, I don’t know, I don’t know why a ghost irritates me, but at that time I couldn’t bear seeing him standing there at the corner with no reason. Maybe that blank eyes annoyed me – or maybe it was just my own sympathy - one evening, I bought a farewell flower for him.

“I know it’s none of my business, but should you just disappear?”

I spoke to him without looking at his face, then realized that this might somehow be an invitation to my house. However, I had spoken, I needed to clarify I didn’t mean to invite him to my place.

“Man, there is no need to wait for someone who probably not be able to see you. And I didn’t mean to invite you to my house or something, I just can’t stand you standing here every day it rains. Why don’t just forget about it and go to heaven peacefully?”

“Also, you’ve been here for a couple of years now – or might be more than that – isn’t it a time you should give up?”

*Damn, why does he have that surprise look on his face?*

“Don’t look at me like that, I’m trying to help you from this endless cycle of misery. Though I don’t know anything about you and don’t want to, I know your effort on waiting will be useless. Almost nobody notices you, see? Only me talking with you here. Someone you’re waiting for might be among that kind of people.”

“I understand you might regret about something, but as I told you before, you already died, it’s in vain. You have to move on.”

“…I don’t know why, either.” Finally, he spoke with me “The only thing I know is I’m waiting for a boy in a blue raincoat.”

“That boy might have grown up and already been dead. Forget it.”

“I can’t. I still have a promise I need to keep.”

“A nonsense promise with a child? After that long time, he has probably forgotten about it already, man, just let it go.”

It was getting dark and I had to go (and didn’t want to talk with a stubborn ghost anymore) so I stopped talking with that ghost, left there, and walked back home.

That night I dreamed, dreaming of a boy walking along the footpath and the sky beginning to rain, so he stopped at the corner of the street.

“Ah! It’s raining! Just a few meters to my home!”

“Would you like to share an umbrella with me, little boy?” A voice came behind him. He turned back and found a man in black suit with umbrella in his hand smiling friendly at him. It was that ghost at the corner. “Don’t be afraid of this bro, just asking to bring you home. You said you were almost home, weren’t you?”

“No, thanks big brother! I have my raincoat.” Said the child then put on a blue raincoat. So, it was the boy that guy had told me. *Is this that ghost’s memory? Is he controlling my dream?*

“No problem, then”

“I’ve seen you here asking everyone about sharing umbrella for ages. Are you an angel?”

That guy laughed. “What make you think that?”

“You always offer an umbrella to whom forget it, so I think you’re an umbrella angel helping everyone not to be wet!”

“Ah…So that’s your thought, huh? Hmm…maybe I’m the real umbrella angel like you thought”

“If you were…could you share your umbrella with me when I forget to bring it, angel brother? I really hate when I’m wet because of rain.”

“Of course, I will, I promise I’ll help you”

“You’ve already promised!”

Then the boy said goodbye to that ghost with a big smile on his face. He ran off but suddenly stopped about a meter away before looked back, with the scariest eyes I’ve seen that faintly glowing red.

“I know you’re the one that eat up all children in this neighborhood every time it rains, so I want to ask you another thing.”

That kid lifted his bag over his head and lowered blue raincoat’s hood, brushed his hair away from behind his neck, revealed **a big mouth with large, sharp tooth and red, long tongue underneath.**

**“Promise me you’ll preserve some meat for me next time, will you?”**

The dream ended at that point with an aggressive sound of my alarm clock.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Several days passed, I almost forgot about that dream. I’d never met him again – maybe because it hadn’t rained when I went home.

Today I just finished eating out at a buffet restaurant with my friends. (To be honest, I don’t have ability in eating at all. I feel like my stomach is always full so that kind of meals are never worth my money.) It started to rain when I was at that corner and saw that ghost appeared again. I thought he had gone somewhere, but I was wrong. I started to understand his situation since that dream came into my mind. Could it be that ‘blue-raincoated monster boy’ never come again? Or he was just searching for prey all this time? Whatever the reason was, I knew I must not talk to him again or else it will be me who is his next meal. Maybe that dream was his warning because I was nice to him. I thought.

However, I was wrong again.

After searching for a small umbrella in my bag for a while, I realized it was not there.

Oh fucking shit. It must be left at my office. It was raining this morning when I went to work, though. I was probably in hurry, so I didn’t notice him.

Another thing came into my mind. When I was a child, I used to live in this neighborhood before leaving because of the rumor about missing children. I came back when I had been employed. If my hypothesis were right – if that weird dream was true, this ghost would be the mastermind behind all those weird incidents. He kidnapped the ones who forgot their umbrella to his world of death. And supposing I was right, it would mean I was in danger. Thinking of this, at that moment I felt a chill ran down my spine.

**“Forget an umbrella? That’s bad…then this angel bro will take you home like I’ve promised.”**

His voice is extremely near me. When did he appear behind me? Why didn’t I notice? What did he mean ‘promise’? I’m definitely not that blue-raincoat monster! Was he mistaken it with me? So many thoughts ran through my brain, my legs started shaking a little. The rain is heavier while I’m thinking and form a little puddle water beside my foot.

**“It might rain heavier than it is now unless you hurry up. You don’t like to be wet, right?”**

Although the rain dropping at the water surface make the reflection blurred, I see a wide mouth with countless sharp tooth under his umbrella. This makes me more confident in my hypothesis – this devil ate everyone who had disappeared from this neighborhood.

However, I didn’t know why my face reflects in the water is smiling, like I’ve been waiting for this opportunity for so long but even myself didn’t know. Suddenly, there is another voice behind me, not so far but really near, which isn’t the monster’s. Moreover, it WAS so similar to my voice like I was saying it myself.

***“Thanks god big bro still remember me! This guy hasn’t allowed me to come out for a long, long time he forgot what WE were! Do you spare me some meat like you’d promised?”***

The umbrella monster’s smile opened wide when he saw another mouth behind my neck, which was ready to swallow everything.

Before I knew it. I’m here in my dark, dull house, with the noise of monster’s mouth complaining nonstop behind my neck, which makes me tremble with fear while writing this. Before my eyes is a dead body of a little girl lying on the floor. Her eyes are still wide-open like her mouth. And next to her is a paper wrote with red ink like blood saying ***“Bon appétit;) – Umbrella angel bro.”***

I don’t know who she is or how this poor girl lies dead in my house. I don’t know what I should do, either. The only thing I know is the monster behind my neck will not stop throwing tantrum until I let it devour her.
