I live in a small village surrounded by hills, olive trees, and stories older than the land itself.

One summer night, me and my cousin had been working all day on our family’s land—trimming trees, collecting apricots, clearing branches. By the time we were done, it was already dark. We still hadn’t watered the lower field we call Wadi land—a valley-like area near a dried stream that only floods during heavy rains.

We said: “Forget it. We’ll water it at dawn.”
Then five minutes later, we changed our minds.
“Why not just finish it now? It’ll be cold in the morning anyway.”

So we grabbed two flashlights and headed down to the Wadi, bringing along our younger cousin—he’s around 13, still in middle school. The kind of kid who jumps at his own shadow.

Naturally, we started messing with him.

We told him stories about al-Sheeb—a local legend, a creature that looks like a wolf but has human eyes and follows you at night. We’d turn off the lights and sneak up behind him, whispering creepy stuff. He was shaking, begging us to stop.

We were cracking up, not taking anything seriously.
Then we got to work. We watered the first irrigation row, then sat down to rest.

We started talking again about al-Sheeb—how it supposedly looks different depending on which region you’re in. I joked that maybe it changes shape depending on who’s looking at it.

Suddenly, my cousin stopped.

He said: “Bismillah…” under his breath.
I looked at him. “What is it?”
He said: “Something just passed by me… around my head. I feel dizzy.”

I told him it was probably his imagination. But deep down, I knew he wasn’t joking. He’s used to working alone in this land at night—he doesn’t scare easily.

Then we saw it.

Something flashed between the olive trees. Not our flashlights. It was too white, too clean. Like a blink of lightning, but small. Like a camera flash in the wrong place.

For the record, the entire Wadi field is fenced with a chain-link barrier. Nobody could’ve gotten in—not without making noise, not without us noticing.

We stood frozen.

Then we heard it.

From the very top of the Wadi, deep into the trees, came a slow, heavy drumming sound.
Once.
Then again.
Then faster.

It wasn’t music. It wasn’t a human rhythm. It was more like… a heartbeat made of stone.

Our younger cousin looked like he was going to faint.
We grabbed our things and started walking out, fast.

But halfway out, we stopped.
We looked at each other and said:
“Should we check it out? Just to be sure?”

We walked back toward the top of the Wadi, flashlights shaking in our hands. No sound now. Just the wind brushing dry leaves.
We scanned every row of olive trees. Every corner.

Nothing.
No lights.
No sound.
No sign anyone—or anything—had ever been there.

We waited a minute. Then two. Still nothing.

And yet, I swear… something was watching us.
I couldn’t see it, but I could feel it. Heavy and quiet, like the land itself was holding its breath.

We left.
Fast.
And we never watered the Wadi at night again.

Our little cousin won’t even talk about that night. He just shakes his head and walks away.

Me? I don’t know what passed near my cousin’s head.
I don’t know what flashed in those trees.
And I don’t know what was beating like a drum in the dark.

But I know this:

We laughed that night.
And whatever was out there…
It laughed back.

What do you think we saw? Has anyone ever heard something similar—like drumming from deep woods or a creature that changes form based on who’s looking at it?
