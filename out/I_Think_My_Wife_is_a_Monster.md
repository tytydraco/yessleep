I first noticed it on the day of our wedding.

She was late to the altar, and the guests were starting to whisper. I was, admittedly, having my own doubts about whether or not she’d gotten cold feet. I gave it another couple of minutes before awkwardly sending her maid of honor to go check up on her. She returned with barely any news of my soon-to-be wife.

“She says she needs more time to get ready,” The maid of honor told me, her voice barely audible over the growing tension in the room.

I sighed heavily and smiled politely at the onlookers. I waited another couple of minutes. 

Just as I was about to call the whole thing off and send everyone home, the soft notes of the piano filled the air, and I turned to the entrance expectantly. And there she was, a vision of beauty, her dress flowing elegantly, her hair intricately styled, and her makeup flawless. At that moment, all my worries melted away.

She walked slowly down the aisle, and I couldn’t contain the grin that spread across my lips. 

As she stood beside me, her smile radiating joy, I noticed a small imperfection. A dash of red stained her front tooth. Not wanting to embarrass her, I leaned in and whispered in her ear. 

“You have something in your teeth.”

She blushed, and I handed her my handkerchief before she faced away from the crowd and wiped her teeth. I gave her a subtle thumbs-up.

It wasn’t until years later did I even began to think about what that dash of red could be.

The next instance took place while she was pregnant with our first child. I had gotten home from work early to find an empty house. My wife, whom I suppose I should introduce as Abigail, didn’t have any plans for that day, so it caught me by surprise. I began to worry as I dialed her number on my phone and paced around the living room as it rang.

“Hello?” 

Her soft voice picked up, and I immediately released a sigh of relief.

“Abby, honey, where are you?” “I just went to the store,” she said reassuringly, “Why? Did something happen?”

I shook my head and smiled, “No, dear, nothing happened; I’ll see you when you get home.”

She returned home within the hour, empty-handed. 

“I thought you went to the store?” I asked after greeting her with a gentle yet loving hug.

Her face went blank as she stared at me before a look of realization dawned on her face. 

“Right, of course, they didn’t have what I was looking for,” She said with a smile. 

“And what were you looking for?”

She smiled at me and brushed past me to the kitchen.

I decided it must have just been pregnancy hormones and shook it off. 

It’s only now that I write this that I remember a distinct background noise on her end of the phone. An almost crunching sound. 

The third instance was a lot more recent. By recent, I mean yesterday. Abigail had said she needed some air after a relatively heated argument, so I let her. It was the middle of the day, and I wasn’t worried about anything happening to her, so I didn’t think much about her being gone for an hour. Then, an hour turned into two hours. Then three. By that time, I had sent her multiple texts about where she was. I’d even called her a couple of times. 

It was around 9 pm when I decided to ask our elderly neighbor to watch our son so I could go out looking for her. First, I tried the park. It was more of a forest with hiking trails than your usual park, but I knew she always frequented it whenever she needed some alone time. 

It didn’t take long for me to come across her, hunched over and shaking. I asked her what was wrong but didn’t receive any answer. That’s when I saw it. A corpse. Dressed in a park ranger uniform, it lay beneath her as she was crouched over it, bloodied and gored. I won’t go into detail about the state the body was in, just know that it had me, someone with a rather strong stomach, doubled over and vomiting. 

The next thing I remember was lying in my bed with my wife beside me, sound asleep.

I know what happened last night was real because I can still taste the bile in my mouth.

So now I relive it all just to let everyone here know that I think my wife is a monster. Yet I love her all the same.
