Hi. I’m new to this Reddit thing so if I’m posting this in the wrong place or something I’m sorry. 

To start, my name is Will, I’m 26 and I’m a dying man. Not by a sickness or anything, but by the Thing outside the window. 

I’m not quite sure what it is. I know what it looks like. I can describe it to you if you want. It has the body of a deer I think. But it stands upright, and instead of hooves it has paws. Like a tiger or a lion. They’re large is what I’m saying. And it has the head of a woman. She’d be pretty, if she wasn’t staring at me from across the street. 

It’s been this way for a while now. Years. I don’t really remember exactly how long it’s been. I’m not getting enough sleep and I unfortunately dream quite vividly, so I may be confusing reality with my imagination. I think it’s been 7, though it feels like 15. 

What I do know for certain is that the deer woman Thing is real. I didn’t make it up. I summoned the damn Thing as a stupid 19 year old touching things I shouldn’t be. I want to tell you about it. So you don’t make the same mistakes I did. 

The first thing I did wrong was snoop. I was at a friend of a friend’s house. Housesitting, sort of. Coming by occasionally to water their plants, vacuum and feed their pet snake. I’d been doing it for a couple of weeks and was getting too comfortable. Too bold. Walking through their rooms and looking at all the weird stuff. They were unique people. The walls of their living room were adorned with shelves, upon which sat books, paintings and trinkets. I heard they traveled a lot. They had a lot of weird plants as well. I’m getting off topic, sorry. I was sitting on their couch, waiting for a mouse to thaw in the kitchen sink. For the snake that is. And I saw a book in one of the bookshelves, completely black, no details or title. I thought it was interesting. So I picked it up. 

That was my second mistake. Opening the damn book. Not stopping myself when I was doing something wrong. I won’t say what was inside. It doesn’t matter now anyways. It’s gone, I burned it. Not that it did anything. I hoped it would undo the Thing, but no. But I’ll tell you what I did with the book. I read it. And I haven’t forgotten it since. I know it sounds impressive to say I’ve memorised a whole book. It’s not. It was only a couple pages with actual words. Words engrained in my brain. I think about them at night. 

And that’s the beauty of it. I can only be rid of the Thing once I forget the words. But I can never forget them, when the thing is always there to remind me. 

But I didn’t just keep it to myself. At the time I was dating a girl. Used to live with her and all. She was my best friend, I told her everything. She even held out for a year. Told me we’d get through it. She was headstrong like that, used to getting her way and making sure it did. She was the one who suggested burning the book. Researching ways to get rid of, or at least stay safe. I would never have figured that company was all that was needed. Not without her. She truly was my all. And it’s all my fault she’s gone. 

See the Thing only comes for you when you are alone. Doesn’t take a lot to scare it off. Just make sure someone’s always nearby. Be it a stranger on the bus, a cab driver or a drunk on the street. The only requirement is that they’re awake and aware. She figured that part out as well. Not to mention, she figured out the solution. 

That one wasn’t intentional. It was an accident. Her car sped up to 50mph on a 20 road. I think she was being chased by the Thing, since she was alone in the car when paramedics found her. She lived though. Broke a couple of ribs, her femur and hit her head pretty badly. But alive. She lives in a care facility in another city now. She doesn’t remember me. I haven’t visited her, the thought of her remembering me and subsequently the Thing breaks me a little every time. 

So when she left I was lucky enough to move in with another friend. And I never told him anything. I was determined to learn from my mistake and somehow solve this on my own. That ended up not mattering. I don’t know why he died, but the only reasonable explanation as to how is the Thing. Maybe he found out somehow. Maybe I talk in my sleep and it’s all my fault this time as well. I don’t know. 

I’m writing this sitting in a waiting room at the hospital. I just identified his body. I don’t know what I’m going to do now. The Thing is standing in the parking lot waiting for me to decide, I can see it through the window. Maybe I’ll meet it head on. Make it go away once and for all so no one ever has to go through what I have. I think I’ll sit here for a little longer to make up my mind. 

Just don’t do what I did. 

Take care.
