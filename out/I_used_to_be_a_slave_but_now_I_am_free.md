My day starts off in an all black room. It's been like this for as long as I can remember. I've always been able to make out the one object in the room, a hard block that I think is for me to lay on. It is so dark that I can't see anything in front of me. I can tell I am wearing no clothes and that I have hair but can never move my hair without extreme movement. This might be bad but It's not the worst aspect of my existence. 

Once every while, I am pushed by something invisible out of my room as if there are no walls into  another room. This room consists of a purple path with a black top that has a small stage at the end. The path is lit by a bright blue light that wraps around the path. The background is a picture taken seemingly high up of a city skyline at night. I try to take in the gaze of the sort of peaceful surrounding before the claws come. 

The claws come from the pitch black ceiling and begin the clothing process. The all to usual outfit of a blue button-up shirt, a yellow jacket, blue jeans, & black leather boots appearing in the claws hands as they equip me with my outfit. They dress me harshly with the cold claws cutting into my skin as they attempt to fit me in the shirt. They then grab me and yank me into the air before landing into the black leather boots. 

Once I am dressed, the claws begin to stitch me into my clothes. The stitches are very clear and somehow cause no blood, but let me tell you it is the most painful thing I've experienced so far. The stitches cut deep into my skin, sewing me into my clothes tight to make sure they don't fall off. The claws fail to stitch all parts of me into my clothes so they and I can still move around. Once the stitching is done, the music starts to play.

It's always the same music. Over and over and over again, the same song. Like a ventriloquist dummy, I was forced to dance to the music against my will and every time it would be the same dance moves over and over and over again. After the song was over I would stop dancing and have my clothes torn from me. My skin would be pulled straight up and even then there was no blood. And just like that this process would repeat. 

My day enslaved in this process was nearly 3 days ago. During the middle of the song, the black darkness that would usually be in front of my eyes suddenly disappeared. In place of it was a boy. He looked to be a teenager and in his hand was holding a white remote attached to his hand with a stitch.   As soon as I saw him I could stop dancing. He was dancing but he stopped as well. As soon as we both stopped dancing we locked eyes and suddenly everything rushed forward. Somehow, someway I ended up as that boy.

I woke up on the sprawled on the floor. I looked at the screen, a T.V. screen and a saw a man sprawled on the walkway wearing a blue-button up shirt, a yellow jacket, blue jeans, & black leather boots. The screen also displayed other things that I couldn't see while enslaved. There was a word at the top of the screen; Jazzy. Below the word was one star and at the bottom of the screen was a display of how to do several of the dance moves performed. I then saw the man get up and grab his head with both hands before being pushed off screen. The screen then turned black.

Soon a DvD popped out of a white box. I took the DvD out and looked at it. The text on the DvD said "Just Dance 4".
