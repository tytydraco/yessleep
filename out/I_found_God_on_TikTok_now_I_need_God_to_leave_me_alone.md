I am terrified. No, I am petrified. I am absolutely convinced this will be the death of me. And if this is my final words, please for the love of anything. Do not fuck around with those “TikTok challenges.” They aren’t a challenge or funny. I honestly did not think people would put things out with this malicious of intent. But I guess it makes sense. Fuck. I heard it again. I’m running out of time.

This all started a week ago. I was scrolling through TikTok at night, you know the doomscroll. And it was about 1:53am, I was bored, fresh off my late night shift. I got off at 12am got home around 12:45am, ate, showered and hopped into my bed. My safe place or so I thought. Now keep in mind. I was NEVER religious. If anything I was the solid neutral friend. Could be a God? Could not be a God? Who knows. I certainly didn’t then. But now I do know. And fuck, I wish I didn’t know.

Now, jumping back to a week ago at 1:53am. I came across a paranormal TikTok challenge. You know “do X, Y and Z. Record your results if you lived blah blah blah” this one caught my eye. Particularly because the person posting looked so… regular? This brunette girl, no cross necklace, no pentagram necklace. Absolutely no indication that this was a biased post. Instead, she was explaining how she never believed in God. But now she does. And it changed her life. She had done all of it with a smile. I kind of laughed at the thought but kept watching. She explained ‘that all you had to do was kneel by your bed. Bow your head, recite “I am open to believing, please now show me your form. I want to believe in you. Please accept what I offer, my blood and alcohol.” Then proceed to get up, walk to the kitchen; get a bowl, put any alcohol in a bowl; then cut your palm let some blood fall into the dish. Go back to your bed and wait. If God believes you to be true, they will show’ easy enough I thought. Checking the comments quick, I saw a bunch of “this is a hoax,” “omg!!! This worked,” “I’m a believer now,” and only one “I regret doing this.” I chuckled and thought ‘fuck it why not’. And fuck I wish I had’ve just scrolled. 

So in my sheer stupidity. Or maybe naivety would be a better word. I got up, grabbed my phone propped it up. And stitched the video, starting off with a “Hey, so I’m doing this challenge and I’m going to record it. Find out whether or not this works.” I did as explained above, said what I was supposed to. Poured out some rum into the bowl. Grabbed my kitchen knife gave the slightest cut I could. Let it drop into the bowl. Grabbed a piece of paper towel for my hand. And went back to bed. Looking at my phone camera I shrugged and said “nothing so far… so I’ll check back in an hour. See where we’re at.” Pausing my recording. I laid down and chuckled, ‘this is probably just some weird thing. I don’t think it’s going to work’ shutting my eyes I sighed. Waiting for something. Just when I started to slip into a bit of sleep. I heard a thud, glass break and then shuffling. 

My eyes snapped awake. Oh hell no. I lived ALONE. I didn’t even have any pets, as per my landlords requirements.

Grabbing my phone I quickly opened TikTok. It was 2:27am, I started recording explaining what happened. And then with my camera I walked out to the kitchen. The bowl was on the floor. In shards. The alcohol and blood mixture was everywhere. Forcing a laugh I said “welp no idea what this means… so guys I will update tomorrow. Hopefully we make it.” Little did I know it was some terrible foreshadowing.

Okay no I need to speed this up. It knows it knows where I am okay. I’m just going to explain this faster. On big thing days I’ll explain more but I can’t keep up with the details. I don’t have the time. 

Day 1: bowl and blood fuckery everywhere.

Day 2: my update ended up capturing a the thud noise and shuffling, but this time. I could hear whispers. I started getting views and people commenting “this is fake,” “are you sure you don’t have hallucinations?” And a whole mixed bag of opinions.

Day 3: this is the first time I saw god. And I don’t think it’s god. I didn’t end up continuing to post on TikTok after this day. Because on this day, I had been laying in bed. It was my day off I was in bed by 12am. And I had opened TikTok, I saw my posts doing well. So I decided let’s do a late night update. At this point, I had started to record, before I could get a word out. I heard my door open. And that’s when my eyes started burning. I started feeling tears prickle in my eyes, I felt my heart rate speed up. And then I saw it. The black body of this being. That’s when I first heard the whispers which were moans, it was a cacophony of sounds. But. That’s when I saw the face. It was porcelain white. It had black eyes, and this smile… the same smile she had. That’s when I dropped my phone. The thing. The god thing. It started crawling, it reached up and grabbed onto my door frame. Slowly crawling up the wall. Then slowly to the ceiling. Making its way towards me. I was in shock. But then I don’t know if it was survival or adrenaline. I grabbed my phone and bolted out of bed. By that I mean I fell but I got out. I slammed my bedroom door behind me holding the door shut, before quickly running and grabbing a kitchen chair. Using it to hold the door shut. Looking at my phone I hit post. Then I stood there, stunned. Waiting to find out if this was a dream. Then I heard the first bang on the door. And the most disgusting voice I heard wailing “I am god. I see all.” Without a second thought, I grabbed a knife, and ran to the coat closet. I quietly opened, got in and then shut the door. Which is where I am still.

Day 4: I didn’t sleep. It hasn’t gotten the door open. But I hear it banging and wailing. Screaming about me going to hell. She commented, as in the starter of this challenge. “Embrace god. You have won,” yeah fucking right.

Day 5: I started smelling incense. I don’t own incense. But the banging stopped. She dm’d me, all she said was “accept god,” I sent back “why the fuck did you post this? Why did you put this out,” which was the point I heard a female voice wail from the room “God accepts all. Let me help you,” I contemplated smashing my phone. But it was too late. Whatever the fuck it is. Is here.

Day 6: I still haven’t slept. But around 6:26pm it broke the door down. I hear voices everywhere and I have maybe 45% battery left. It hasn’t found me yet. I don’t think it can see. She is still messaging me. She said her name is Mary. She has been blowing up my phone. She’s begging me to embrace it. She’s even saying she will pay me. I need to sleep.

Day 7: Well. You can tell how fucking day 7 is going. It’s 5:19am. I slept. But I just saw what I now think is hell. And it’s become aware I think that I am still here. People have been commenting on my post asking if I am okay. I haven’t responded. I don’t think I am going to make it. 

I keep hearing it wail. I think it’s mad. Today it’s screaming. That’s all it’s doing. 

Fuck fuckfuck-I hear it outside the closet. I hear it opening the door.
