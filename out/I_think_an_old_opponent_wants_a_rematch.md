They say fighters don’t scare easy, maybe that’s true. Maybe we just learn how to compartmentalize it and stash fear somewhere deep, behind the ribs, under the muscle, somewhere locked in the deep dark corners of the brain. Inside the ring, that works, you don’t feel, you react.

Out here?

Out here, in the quiet of the real world, fear doesn’t ring a bell. There’s no ref to stop the fight when things get ugly. Since I was a kid, fists were the only language I understood. The streets taught me survival but the ring? That’s where I found purpose, discipline, a will to live.

I walked into a boxing gym at fifteen and never walked back out the same. Everything before that moment blurred. Who I was, what I’d done, none of it mattered anymore. I was reborn under fluorescent lights and the sound of jump ropes slapping concrete.

I was fighting in tournaments across the country, stopped giving a damn about school or relationships, I lived for the gym. Every bell, every bruise, every breath of sweat and blood was holy, it was my sanctuary.

I left the sport eventually but fighters don’t quit, not truly, it's damn near impossible. Soon after I hung up the gloves, I ended up falling into the underground world of bare knuckle fighting before it ever got legalized here in the states. These were the kind of fights with no gloves and no rules. The kind that strip you bare and show you who you really are. Man eat man, type of shit.

Fighting isn’t just a job. It’s a sickness. An addiction. An itch that needs scratched. Winning a fight is a drug only a few ever get to experience in their lifetime.

These days, I live alone in a cramped apartment with creaky floors and lukewarm radiators. My only family is a black fluffball named Sugar Ray and I coach kids at a nearby gym. Itry not to drink too much and I manage to sleep just enough to feel human.

It was going alright until a few months ago.

It started with the mail.

Unmarked envelopes with no return address were just slipped in with the junk and bills. 

Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened the first, inside was a photo of an old, abandoned building.

Next one: a prison.

Then it got stranger, each one seemingly topping the last.

A photo of a crack pipe. 

Redacted arrest records—possession, assault, attempted murder. 

Medical files came next: fractured jaw bones, orbital breaks, brain trauma. X-rays to match. 

Psychiatric evaluations—schizophrenia, PTSD, violent obsessions.

I didn’t know what I was looking at or why someone was sending it to me.

Then, just as suddenly, the mail stopped.

Then the knocking began.

Three short taps.

Soft. Like someone didn’t want to be heard.

It was 11:37 PM. I remember the time because I’d just cracked a beer and was watching the old Hagler vs. Mugabi fight. Absolute classic. When the taps started, I paused the tape and just listened.

Silence.

I opened the door but there was nobody. Just a flickering streetlight playing tricks on my eyes.

Next night, same time. Three knocks. No one outside.

This time, I didn’t open the door. Just pressed my ear to the wood and I heard breathing.

Told myself I was imagining it. I wanted to imagine it. Chalk it up to rusty instincts.

Third night, once again, three knocks.

I ran and yanked the door open and once again no one was on the porch but this time, across the street, under the dying streetlight, stood a figure. All black. Hood up.

The light flickered and he vanished.

After that, things got... subtle, to say the least.

My toothbrush was moved. My coffee mug turned the wrong way. Small stuff, but I noticed. I always had an eye for the small details in life.

Then my fucking salt shaker ended up in the freezer. Which was strange. I started questioning myself, if all the years of blows to the head had finally caught up to me and I was actually losing it.

What made matters worse though was Sugar Ray went missing.

I didn’t sleep. Just sat around with a baseball bat across my lap. I always found comfort and strange peace in the dark, maybe because the ring was always lit up like a stage and I had to overcome so much fear and anxiety so the darkness became my sanctuary.

At 3:17 AM, I heard the back door creak.

I crept to the curtain, held my breath and ripped it aside.

The back door flew open and I swung the bat.

Nothing. Damn near ripped my shoulder out of place whiffing like that.

Then something brushed my leg, startled the fuck out of me but when I looked down.

Sugar Ray.

He was home.

Alive.
I called the cops and they sent two uniforms. They took some notes and told me to get cameras.

I did.

One at the front, one at the back, figured that'd get the job done.

For two nights, I didn’t sleep, just stared at the feeds.

Third night, exhaustion won and I dozed off in the chair.

Camera alert woke me so I scrambled myself together and pulled up the footage.

There he was.

Standing on my porch, facing the camera.

Still hooded, but I could see part of his face. 

Jaw hung crooked. Slack.

He raised his fist and threw a jab into the air, like he was shadowboxing.

Right then, my stomach dropped, because somewhere in the dark corners of my mind, I recognized that jab.

Every fighter has a signature, a tell, a fingerprint I daresay, in the way they throw.

His left eye was milky and scarred.

Detached retina.

I had all these pictures and puzzle pieces to work with but my brain just wasn't cooperating, it was like having the answer to a question right on the tip of the tongue, it was getting so fucking frustrating not being able to put things together. I knew for a fact that I knew those movements, that I knew in my heart of hearts who this person was. I just couldn't put it together.

Days passed, quiet ones at that.

Then came the night that haunts my fucking dreams to this day.

I’d stayed late at the gym that night because it was gym wars aka sparring night.

I had got home tired but I remember walking up to my front door and putting my key in the lock, I had this bolt of electricity shoot through me in an instant as I realized the door was already unlocked.

I entered slowly and the house was absolutely freezing. The hair on my arms standing and my hands were trembling.

I quickly noticed my bedroom door was slightly open.

I knew in an instant something was wrong.

I pushed the door open fully and screamed.

Sugar Ray was nailed to the fucking wall.

Mutilated.
His guts dangling. 

Eyes wide and empty.

For the first time in my adult life, I cried.

On the bed was an unlabeled VHS tape. First thought that ran through my head was the fact I didn't even own a fucking VCR to play the fucking thing. Only place I could think to find one was the gym.

I ran to the gym and dug through the old storage room and found one. It was dusty as hell but nothing a little air from the lungs couldn't fix.

I hooked it up and pressed play.

It started with footage of me, someone was walking around me with a handheld camera, watching me sleep. As the film glitched out, an old fight started playing. It was grainy and hard to make out what it was at first but then I realized this wasn't just a fight. 
It hit me like a gut punch as I remembered. The memories flowing back to me like a tidal wave.

Terry "The Rainmaker" Raines.

Twenty years ago to the damn day. He was a soldier turned fighter. Tough as nails but so damn sloppy. Always led with his chin. I still remember setting the trap, catching him clean with a right hand that shattered his eye socket and detached his retina. I followed that beauty up with a left hook that broke his jaw.

He hit the floor, lights out.

He never fought again.

Never saw him again, hell I hadn't even heard of him since then.

Well, until now.

The tape was on an obnoxious loop of my punches landing. Over and over, like a punishment.

It cut to new footage of Terry inside of my room.

He was hurting my cat.

Doing unspeakable things to my poor fucking baby, man.

At the end, the camera tilted and he stared into it with his stupid ass crooked jaw.

Smiling and then he whispered something.

I had to take that stupid fucking tape out and manually rewind it three fucking times to hear it.

“You took my life. Now I’m gonna take yours.”

I gave the cops everything, I had, his name and the tape.

They seemed to chalk shit up and just moved on.

So I did too.

New city. New hair. New name.

I don’t sleep much, these days though. I know how obsession works. I know how a fighter thinks when he believes he's been wronged. I know he’s still out there. 

Hunting me. 

Training for a rematch I never agreed to.

Sooner or later, the bell will ring and one of us won’t walk away.

I just don't know if I have it in me anymore to go to that dark place that I'm gonna need to go to in order to do whats gonna need to be done.

Problem is, this morning, I got another envelope.

No return address.

Just a photo...

..my new house.
